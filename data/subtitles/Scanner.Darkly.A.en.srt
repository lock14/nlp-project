1
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,918
I looked them up.

2
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,391
They're aphids.

3
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,915
They're in my hair, on my skin,
in my lungs.

4
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,276
And the pain, Barris, it's unreasonable.

5
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,032
They're all over the place.

6
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,836
- They've completely gotten Millie too.
- Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

7
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,310
Listen, you gotta get out of there.
I'll meet you over at Joe's Cafe at 3.

8
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,151
Calm down, everything's gonna be fine.

9
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,913
Put a couple of them in a jar
so I can get them examined.

10
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,031
I'm sure they're aphids,
but you never know.

11
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,635
Just in case, okay? Just do it.
Relax, relax.

12
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,677
Gentlemen of the Anaheim 709th chapter
of the Brown Bear Lodge...

13
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,149
...we have a wonderful opportunity
this afternoon.

14
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,675
The county of Orange has provided us
with a chance...

15
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,513
...to hear from and put questions to...

16
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,229
...an undercover narcotics agent
who is out there on our behalf...

17
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,675
...fighting this awful
Substance D epidemic.

18
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
It's no secret we're living
in a culture of addiction.

19
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,429
Nearly 20 percent of the population
can now be classified as addicts.

20
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,159
And as far as anyone can tell,
there is but one company...

21
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,117
...that is working and helping
this situation.

22
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,351
That company is our sponsor, New Path.

23
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,596
You will notice
you can barely see this man...

24
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,797
...because he is wearing
what is called a "scramble suit".

25
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,634
The exact same suit he wears
and, in fact, must wear...

26
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,949
...during certain parts,
in fact, most parts...

27
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,314
...of his daily activities
of law enforcement.

28
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,752
This man, whom we will call Fred
because that is the code name...

29
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,194
...under which he reports
information he gathers...

30
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,915
...once within the scramble suit,
cannot be detected...

31
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,151
...by even the latest in
voice- and facial-recognition technology.

32
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,675
The scramble suit itself
is purportedly made up...

33
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,627
...of approximately a million and a half
fraction-representations...

34
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,680
...of men, women, and children
in every variant...

35
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:04,833
...making the wearer of a scramble suit
the ultimate Everyman.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,797
This is terrible.

37
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:10,192
He looks, does he not,
like a constantly shifting, vague blur...

38
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,237
...and nothing more, am I right?

39
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,470
Let's hear it for the vague blur.

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,519
If you saw me on the street
without this suit on, you'd say:

41
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,274
"There goes a total dope fiend".

42
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,954
You'd feel aversion and walk away.

43
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't look like you. I can't afford to.

44
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,711
My life depends on it.

45
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,952
I'm not going to tell you first
what I do as an undercover officer...

46
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,317
...tracking down dealers and the source
of their illegal drugs...

47
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,391
...in the streets of our cities
and corridors of our schools...

48
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,552
...here in Orange County.

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,433
I'm going to tell you what I'm afraid of.

50
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,435
What I fear, night and day,
is that our children...

51
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,478
...your children and my children...

52
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:02,680
I have two little ones, very little...

53
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,274
...but not too little to be addicted.

54
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,355
Calculatedly addicted to Substance D
for profit by drug terrorists.

55
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,709
As many of you know,
our military and their associates...

56
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,791
...are actively engaged in countries...

57
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,918
...where it is believed
the organic component of Substance D...

58
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:22,829
...a small, highly toxic flower, originates.

59
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,593
And while our troops are down there
fighting for us...

60
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:31,036
...it is up to each and every
one of us here...

61
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,637
...to do our part in eliminating
the demand for this drug.

62
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
It's important you as citizens
continue to report...

63
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:42,230
...all suspicious activity and individuals...

64
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,439
...for, simply put, if there were
no demand in our society...

65
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,831
...there would be no market
for these leeches to exploit.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,673
Each day, this disease
takes its toll on us.

67
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,675
And each day, the flow of profits
and where they go...

68
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,949
Well, it isn't about the profits anyhow,
it's something else.

69
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:14,439
What'd you see happen?

70
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,757
If you were a diabetic
and you didn't have money for insulin...

71
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,309
...would you steal to get the money
or just die?

72
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,632
I think you better go back to the,
you know, prepared text there, Fred.

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,276
I forgot it.
I think I have a block against this shit.

74
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,716
Repeat after me,
but make it sound casual.

75
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,439
"Where the profits flow,
we will s...

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,797
...and then
retribution will swiftly follow.

77
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,317
At that moment, I would not
want to be in their shoes". Got it?

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,598
You know why I've got a block
against this bullshit?

79
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,480
Because this is what gets people
on drugs.

80
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:57,110
It's all so disgusting you want to
lurch off and become a user.

81
00:07:57,281 --> 00:08:00,000
Come on, Fred, just say this shit
and get it over with.

82
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,273
Anyway...

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,117
Substance D.

84
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,713
D.

85
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,678
D is for dumbness and despair
and desertion.

86
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:22,720
The desertion of your friends from you,
you from your friends.

87
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,757
Everyone from everyone.

88
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,632
Isolation and loneliness...

89
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:33,360
...and hating and suspecting each other.

90
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,751
D is, finally, death.

91
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,432
Slow death.

92
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,551
From the head down.

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,836
Well, that's it.

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,395
Okay, let's eat.

95
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,919
All right, what's your name?

96
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,592
My name...

97
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,596
You don't know your name?
Well, that's interesting.

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,750
Probable cause. Out of the car, sir.

99
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,470
Now, you have the right
to remain silent until...

100
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:37,951
And... And anything you say can and
will be used against you when you...

101
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,078
When what?

102
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,197
You know, fuck this shit.

103
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,557
- Hello?
- Hey, how you doing?

104
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,871
Oh, I'm all right.

105
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,832
Anything wrong?

106
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,833
Just this fucker stole 50 bucks' worth
of shit from us today.

107
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:18,197
My boss said it was somehow my fault,
and it's coming out of my paycheck...

108
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,719
...which I don't even think is legal.
I mean, can he legally do that?

109
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,030
Yeah, they can't do that.

110
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,080
At least, they used to not
be able to do that. I'll check.

111
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:33,235
Hey, Donna,
can I get anything from you?

112
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,993
Yeah, how much?

113
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,038
- Ten.
- Ten?

114
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:41,238
Yeah, I'm hurting really bad.
I'll pay you back later.

115
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,475
- Yeah, okay. Say, day after tomorrow?
- Any sooner?

116
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:49,394
I'll come by later, like around 8?

117
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:50,995
Yeah. I'll see you later.

118
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,634
- Okay. All right, bye.
- Okay, bye.

119
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,716
You see, all symptoms are purposeful,
be they positive or negative.

120
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,951
You see?
I wouldn't feel strangely about it.

121
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,918
Just the idea of turning yourself
over for rehabilitation...

122
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,642
...is only naturally gonna make you
a little apprehensive.

123
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:12,360
But that's just a manifestation
of the fear.

124
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,081
It's just the:
That's the D talking.

125
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:18,836
You know, the first thing I hear,
that when you go into the New Path...

126
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,389
...what they do to you,
they cut your pecker off.

127
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,440
They could never get away with that.
You kidding? That's a myth.

128
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:27,320
It's actually the spleen
that's remanded to their custody.

129
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,552
- The what?
- Hey, how is everything?

130
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:30,995
Everything is super good.

131
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:34,359
Not with me.
I got a lot of problems nobody else has.

132
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,638
No, no, come on.
More people than you'd think.

133
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,952
And more people each day. This is
a world getting progressively worse.

134
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,270
Can we not agree on that?

135
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:45,678
- What's on the dessert menu?
- Would you like to order some dessert?

136
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,240
Like what?

137
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,634
Well, we have fresh strawberry pie...

138
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:55,158
...and fresh peach pie
that we make here ourselves.

139
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,870
- No, we don't want any dessert.
- All right.

140
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,840
Fucking fruit pies are for old ladies.

141
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:08,120
- What do you think about New Path?
- While it doesn't matter...

142
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,000
...what I think, I kind of
have to tip my hat to any entity...

143
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,356
...that can bring
so much integrity to evil.

144
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,831
I mean, imagine this:
A seemingly voluntary, privatized gulag...

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,961
...managed to eliminate the middlemen
of public accountability and free will.

146
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,157
Wrapped it up in a bow
and gave it like a gift.

147
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,073
I mean, come on, this is:

148
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
This is awe-inspiring stuff.

149
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,918
I heard you have to go cold turkey.

150
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:36,518
Cold turkey doesn't even apply
to Substance D.

151
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,831
Unlike the legacy
of inherited predisposition...

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,957
...to addictive behavior
or substances...

153
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,556
...this needs no genetic assistance.

154
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:48,913
There's no weekend warriors on the D.
You're either on it...

155
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,480
...or you haven't tried it.

156
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:55,034
- Well, I like it.
- Yeah.

157
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,359
How many caps do you take per day?

158
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,320
Very difficult to determine.

159
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:05,874
But not that many.

160
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:09,716
Well, like the old-school pharmacopoeia,
a tolerance develops, you know.

161
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,238
These visions of bugs,
they're just garden-variety psychosis...

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,517
...but a clear indication
that you've hurdled...

163
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:19,038
...over the initial fun and euphoric phase
and passed on...

164
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,831
...to the next phase.

165
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:25,557
News from the guinea-pig grapevine
suggests that whatever it is...

166
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:29,032
...we won't know
until it's way too late, you see?

167
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,955
You see that we're all canaries
in the coalmine on this one?

168
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,716
I do think I have another source.

169
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:36,759
That Donna chick.

170
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,673
- Bob's girl?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:42,470
Yeah, his girl. Although I know
for a fact he never gets in her pants.

172
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,360
Really?

173
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,282
- But he talks like he does.
- Oh, yeah.

174
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:51,001
That's Bob Arctor.
He talks like he does many things.

175
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,835
That's not the same, my friend.
That's not the same thing.

176
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,799
Donna has an aversion to bodily contact.

177
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,794
I mean, junkies lose their interest in sex,
you realize...

178
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:03,158
...due to organs swelling up
from vasoconstriction.

179
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:07,998
And I have observed in her
an inordinate failure of sexual arousal...

180
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,356
...not just toward Bob Arctor...

181
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,879
...but other males as well.

182
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,760
I can't believe she doesn't put out.

183
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:21,039
Well, she would
if she were handled right.

184
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,679
For instance, I could show you
how to sleep with her...

185
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,719
...for less than 3 dollars.

186
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,913
I don't wanna sleep with her.
I wanna buy from her.

187
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:35,195
Donna does coke, all right?

188
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,352
Three dollars doesn't get you
a line of coke.

189
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:38,875
That's where you're wrong, pal.

190
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,321
What they've deliberately done...

191
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:29,154
...is mix the cocaine with the oil
so it cannot be extracted.

192
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,792
But my knowledge of chemistry
is such...

193
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:38,161
...that I know precisely how to
separate the oil from the cocaine.

194
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,995
Now, now I will freeze it.

195
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,520
Cause cocaine crystals to rise to the top
because they are lighter than the oil.

196
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:49,957
The terminal step, of course,
I keep to myself, but suffice to say...

197
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:54,673
...it involves an intricate and
methodological process of filtering.

198
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,192
How long is it gonna be in there?

199
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:00,192
Just about a half an hour.

200
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,636
You know, I've been thinking, Barris.

201
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,681
Even if we do get a pure gram of cocaine
out of this deal...

202
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,515
...I don't wanna use it on Donna
to get in her pants.

203
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:12,115
- That'd be like buying her.
- No, it'd be an exchange.

204
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,592
You give her a gift,
and she gives you one.

205
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:22,030
Besides, we're talking about
Bob's girl here.

206
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,440
And this is his house. He's my friend.

207
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:27,036
He lets you and Luckman live here.

208
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:32,115
There's a great deal about Bob Arctor
you're not aware of.

209
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,596
How did New Path rig it?

210
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,798
They're the one place in our entire
country that can't be scanned.

211
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,192
All the rest of us can be tracked
24 hours a day...

212
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,273
...but no, not at New Path.

213
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,876
Hey, that's their contract
with the government.

214
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:54,641
But I think you're right, it would be
a good place for a dealer to hide.

215
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,595
What about Donna Hawthorne?

216
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:03,277
I'm systematically working up
to her supplier.

217
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:06,832
The quantities I'm buying now
are basically beyond her capacity.

218
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,231
She doesn't have
enough front money to handle it.

219
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:12,872
Matter of time before she's hooking me
up with the next person up the ladder.

220
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,432
I think soon we'll have somebody
who knows something...

221
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,082
...and they'll be worth busting.

222
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,955
What about Jim Barris
and Ernie Luckman?

223
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:22,319
Same shit. Nothing new.

224
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:26,192
Well, what about Charles Freck
and Robert Arctor?

225
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,480
- Up to pretty much the same old thing.
- Even Arctor?

226
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,039
Arctor?

227
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,154
Yeah, he doesn't seem
to be doing much.

228
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:40,712
Still working his nowhere,
Handy Brake and Tire job.

229
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:44,034
Drops a few caps of Death
cut with meth during the day.

230
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,556
I'm not so sure.

231
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,633
We just got a tip in from an informant...

232
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:49,997
...that Arctor has funds
above and beyond...

233
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,756
...what he gets from his little job.

234
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,515
And when we checked into it...

235
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:57,880
...we found he wasn't even
working there full-time.

236
00:18:58,682 --> 00:18:59,957
Yeah.

237
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,480
Who's this informant?

238
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,790
We don't know.

239
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:07,318
Undoubtedly it's a vengeance burn.
That's how these druggies are.

240
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:10,838
I mean, phoning in on each other
every time they get pissed off.

241
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,674
Anyhow, as of now...

242
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:15,674
...I'm officially assigning you
to observe Arctor.

243
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:21,396
If we're ever gonna get to the bottom
of this, it'll be through this guy.

244
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,920
So will that mean
full-time viewer recording?

245
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,880
We got no choice.

246
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,238
We'll install a new
holographic scanning system.

247
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,597
You'll let us know
when they're out of the house.

248
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:34,515
We'll want storage and printout
on everything.

249
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:43,519
Total, total, total, totally,
total, total, total providence.

250
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,798
I am walking home,
I find myself on a street I am rarely on...

251
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,999
...and look what I obtain for a mere $50.

252
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,996
- What is it?
- Oh, this would be an 18-speed bike...

253
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,642
...of the all-terrain variety.

254
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:58,352
I noticed it in a neighbor's yard,
and I inquired as to its availability.

255
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:00,751
They had four of them.
So I made a cash offer.

256
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:04,278
- Don't. Drugs.
- Fifty dollars. They acquiesced.

257
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,433
They threw in these
lemon-yellow racing pants.

258
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:09,913
Even hoisted it over the fence for me,
which I found to be very neighborly.

259
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:14,473
That's weird. I didn't know you could
get a 18-speed bike nearly new for $50.

260
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,759
It's amazing what you can get for $50.

261
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:19,278
I'll give you 60 right now,
no questions asked.

262
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,718
You know,
this bike looks a lot like the bike...

263
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:25,671
...that this girl lives across the street
had that got ripped off a month ago.

264
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,162
This bike could be hot.

265
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:29,882
They probably jacked it,
these hoister friends of yours.

266
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,477
Sure did, if they've got four
and selling it that cheap.

267
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:36,396
Right? You should at least show it to her
so she could see if it's hers.

268
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:37,836
Yeah. Okay, I can do that...

269
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,836
...but this is a boy's bike, okay?
So it can't be.

270
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:44,278
Not to invalidate your intuition,
but it's not possible. Thank you.

271
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:47,798
Why do you say it's an 18-speed
when it only has nine gears?

272
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:49,682
Huh, what?

273
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:53,392
Yeah. Yeah. Six right here,
three at the other end of the chain.

274
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,123
Six plus three equals nine.

275
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,961
- It's a nine-speed bike.
- Yeah, but even a nine-speed bike...

276
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,511
...for 50 bucks. He still got a good deal.

277
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,599
Okay, those guys told me
it was 18 speeds.

278
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,673
I just got Greeked. I just got...

279
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:08,559
Wait. Wait.

280
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:10,753
Now I count eight.

281
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:13,117
Six here and then two in the front.

282
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,512
- That makes eight.
- What do you think happened...

283
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,559
- ... to the missing gears?
- Think? I know.

284
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,838
They were working
on it, these gypsy grifters...

285
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:22,038
...with improper tools,
no technical knowledge.

286
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,000
No understanding of reverse engineering.

287
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,722
When they attempted to reassemble it,
they panicked.

288
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,999
They left nine orphan gears there
on the floor.

289
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,881
They're still there
on the garage floor.

290
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,272
Let's just go rescue
the orphan gears, dude!

291
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,115
Don't you see
that that's part of the plan?

292
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:38,876
They're going to try to sell them to me,
not give them...

293
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:43,082
...as they rightfully should have as
included in part of the original sale price.

294
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:46,440
Oh, my God, there's no telling
what else they've bait-and-switched.

295
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah, but if all of us go together,
oh, they'll give them back.

296
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,113
Oh, you bet they will.
Oh, you bet they will.

297
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:55,001
- Let's just go as a team, okay.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:58,155
Are you sure there are only nine gears
on this bike?

299
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:01,077
- Eight.
- Okay, eight, nine, whatever.

300
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:05,680
Don't you think that before we go over
and accuse, and start some shit...

301
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:07,195
...we should find out for sure?

302
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,718
Right, Donna.
Who do we know who's an authority...

303
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:11,520
...on this type of bi...?

304
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,516
Get off me!

305
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,276
Let me...

306
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:19,276
We are all way too close to this.

307
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,641
There's only one thing we can do...

308
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:24,601
...to thwart these albino,
shape-shifting lizard bitches.

309
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:27,436
We are gonna take this outside,
ask the first person we see.

310
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:30,640
Introduce some novelty.
That way we get an objective viewpoint.

311
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:31,951
Yeah.

312
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,478
By the way, I might take you up
on that $60 offer.

313
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,076
No, that was for an 18-speed.

314
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:39,632
You know, for this, 18 minus 10,
I'll give you 23.75.

315
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,760
Are you certain
that's the right math on that?

316
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,355
Come in.

317
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,991
You are Officer Fred?

318
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,471
- Yes.
- Have a seat, please.

319
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,834
All right, Fred.

320
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,880
We're going to administer
several tests...

321
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:07,758
...and there will be no
physical discomfort involved.

322
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,719
If this is about the speech I gave to the...

323
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:14,079
What this is about stems from
a recent departmental survey...

324
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,711
...showing that undercover agents
have been admitted...

325
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:19,954
...to neural-aphasia clinics
during the last month.

326
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:23,240
You're conscious of the high factor
of addictiveness of Substance D?

327
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,471
Of course I am.

328
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,317
Of course,
these tests in no way pertain...

329
00:23:27,482 --> 00:23:30,713
...to the addictive properties
of Substance D, but to...

330
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:34,192
Well, let's start
with the set-ground test first.

331
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:39,632
Within the apparently meaningless lines
is an object that we would all recognize.

332
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:43,954
You are to tell me what that object is
and point to it in the total field.

333
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,842
In many of those taking Substance D...

334
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:49,359
...a split between the right and the left
hemisphere of the brain occurs...

335
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:53,278
...which results in a defect within both
the percept and cognitive systems.

336
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:56,434
Although apparently the cognitive
continues to function normally.

337
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,877
You located the familiar object
in this drawing?

338
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:01,798
It should just jump right out at you.

339
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:04,923
I see a Coke bottle.

340
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,916
A soda-pop bottle is correct.

341
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,590
Was it in the speech I gave?

342
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:13,073
Maybe it seemed I showed
a little bilateral dysfunction there.

343
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:17,714
I mean, might have seemed
a little slushed.

344
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:20,317
Are you getting any cross-chatter?

345
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,115
- What?
- Cross-chatter between hemispheres.

346
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:28,161
If there's damage to
the left hemisphere...

347
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:30,278
...where the linguistic skills
are located...

348
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:34,197
...then sometimes the right hemisphere
will fill in to the best of its ability.

349
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,152
I don't know.
I mean, not that I'm aware of.

350
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:43,112
What do you see in this second picture?

351
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,477
A sheep.

352
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:52,875
Show me the sheep.

353
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:55,873
An impairment of set-background
discrimination...

354
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,353
...can get you into a heap of trouble.

355
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:03,118
Instead of perceiving no forms,
you perceive faulty forms.

356
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,673
So there is no sheep here, is there?

357
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:09,551
Was I close?

358
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:12,284
This is not a Rorschach test,
where some abstract blot...

359
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:14,798
...can be interpreted many ways
by many subjects.

360
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,875
This has one specific object.

361
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:20,751
In this case, a dog.

362
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,155
A dog.

363
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:27,157
What's that mean,
that I saw a sheep instead?

364
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:29,790
Who knows.
Only after the entire set has been run...

365
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,761
- ... can we determine...
- Why this is superior to the Rorschach...

366
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,198
...is it's not interpretive.

367
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:37,276
There are many wrongs,
but there is only one right.

368
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:38,875
You either get it or you don't.

369
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:41,113
And if you show a run of not getting it...

370
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:43,638
...then we have a fix on
a functional impairment...

371
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:47,000
...and we dry you out for a while,
until you test better later on.

372
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,197
At New Path?

373
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,115
- Undoubtedly.
- Undoubtedly.

374
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:54,162
Now, what do you see in this drawing...

375
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:57,712
...among these particular
black-and-white lines?

376
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,395
Plastic dog shit.

377
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:03,837
The little kind you can buy
and put in someone's bed.

378
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,276
Can I go now?

379
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:10,320
You know, Fred, if you keep
your sense of humor like you do...

380
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,758
...you just might make it after all.

381
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:15,518
Make it. Make what?

382
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,355
The team? The girl?

383
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:19,002
Make good? Make do?

384
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,632
Make out? Make sense?
Make money? Make time?

385
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:23,317
Define your terms.

386
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,394
The Latin for "make" is facere...

387
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,599
...which always reminds me of fuckere...

388
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,516
...which is Latin for "to fuck".

389
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:33,960
And I haven't been getting shit
in that department lately.

390
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,674
If you guys are psychologist-types...

391
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:41,076
...and you've been monitoring my
endless debriefings with Hank, tell me:

392
00:26:41,564 --> 00:26:43,473
What the hell is Donna's deal?

393
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,520
What do I do? I mean...

394
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:49,676
...how do you make it with that kind of
sweet, unique, stubborn little chick?

395
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,119
You could buy her flowers.

396
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,002
Really?

397
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:57,519
This time of year, you can get
little blue flowers at any nursery.

398
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,560
Give them to her.

399
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:09,442
Yeah.

400
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:14,441
Hey, Fred, glad you could make it.

401
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:20,117
This is the informant who phoned in
about Bob Arctor, and I mentioned him.

402
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:21,797
- Yes.
- Anyway, he phoned in again...

403
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:25,876
...and we challenged him to step forth
and identify himself.

404
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,954
Do you know this man?

405
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:30,481
Sure do.

406
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:33,597
You're James Barris, aren't you?

407
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,402
So, Mr. Barris, what's your information?

408
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:42,195
I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of
a covert terrorist drug organization.

409
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:45,992
They are well-funded and they have
arsenals of weapons at their disposal.

410
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:47,643
And what is this organization?

411
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:52,875
I believe it to be political in nature
and very much against this country.

412
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:54,840
An enemy of the U.S.

413
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:59,952
Can you give us any specific names of
anyone else in this organization...

414
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:01,682
...persons Arctor meets with?

415
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,481
Yes. Miss Donna Hawthorne.

416
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:07,318
On a variety of pretexts, he will
go over to her place of residence...

417
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:10,794
...and colludes with her regularly,
I've noticed.

418
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:12,363
Colludes.

419
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,642
- Colludes.
- What do you mean?

420
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:17,840
Well, I've followed him in my own car
without his knowledge.

421
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:20,074
- He goes there often.
- Yes, as often as...

422
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:22,473
- She is his girl.
- Right.

423
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:25,317
- Mr. Arctor also seemingly...
- Hold up, hold up.

424
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,480
You think there's anything to this, Fred?

425
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:31,195
I think we should definitely
look at his evidence.

426
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:33,240
All right. Bring in your evidence.

427
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:35,998
All of it. We want names most of all.

428
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:39,634
Now, have you seen
Mr. Arctor involved...

429
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:42,840
...in any large quantities of drugs?

430
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:45,278
To be certain.
And I have carefully taken samples...

431
00:28:45,884 --> 00:28:47,157
Again, without his knowledge.

432
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:50,361
...when the opportunity presented itself,
strictly for you to analyze.

433
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,480
- I can bring those in as well.
- Great.

434
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:56,281
Is there anything else
you wish to state at this time?

435
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:01,119
There is. Mr. Arctor is an addict.
He is addicted to Substance D.

436
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,957
And I fear that his mind has become
deranged over time...

437
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:09,561
...and he is now officially
to be considered dangerous.

438
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:11,842
- Dangerous.
- Yes. He is having episodes...

439
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:14,836
...that would occur with
brain damage from Substance D.

440
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm quite certain, also, that the optic
chiasm has deteriorated somewhat...

441
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,075
...due to a weak ipsilateral component.

442
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:24,998
This sort of unsupported speculation,
as I've already warned you, Mr. Barris...

443
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,314
...is completely worthless.

444
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:31,797
Now, we'll be sending an officer
with you to gather your evidence.

445
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:33,875
- All right?
- May I...?

446
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,079
An officer out of uniform, of course.

447
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,237
No, see, I could be murdered.

448
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:43,556
As I've already said,
Mr. Arctor has this cache of weapons.

449
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:48,319
Mr. Barris, we appreciate this
and the extreme risk you are taking.

450
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:53,719
And if it works out, and your information
is valuable in obtaining a conviction...

451
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,443
- ... then naturally...
- But that is not the reason I'm here.

452
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,834
You see, this man is...
He just has a soul sickness.

453
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:03,394
His brain is damaged from the use of
this toxic and most terrible substance.

454
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:08,273
Nonetheless, the reason I am here is
I feel that I may have certain qualities...

455
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:11,753
...that would qualify me
to perhaps come over to your side.

456
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:14,358
To surrender and come to
the side of law enforcement.

457
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:18,073
- I would like an employment application.
- We don't care why you're here.

458
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:22,839
We only care whether your evidence and
material amount to anything.

459
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,121
The rest is your problem.

460
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:34,436
Perhaps at the desk
I can get an employment...

461
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:36,919
You are about to witness...

462
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:41,555
...for approximately 61 cents of
ordinary household materials...

463
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:44,442
...the perfect homemade silencer.

464
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,516
Barris, the neighbors are gonna hear.

465
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:48,960
No, they only call in murders
in this neighborhood.

466
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:52,753
Plus, Freckledeck, it's a silencer.
They're not gonna hear anything.

467
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:56,439
Well, I'm pretty fucking sure
they're illegal.

468
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:01,917
In this day and age, the type of society
we find ourselves living in...

469
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:03,278
...every person of worth...

470
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:06,278
...needs to have a gun at all times,
to protect themselves.

471
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:07,797
And we're off.

472
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,443
That sure is some silencer.

473
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:28,279
Yes. What it did was augment
the sound, rather than dampen it.

474
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,196
But I almost have it.
I believe I have it in principle, anyway.

475
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,356
Oh, well, the good news is,
regardless of what you do next time...

476
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:38,153
...it'll be a silencer to us,
because we're now deaf!

477
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,401
What happened?

478
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,516
How'd I get here?

479
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:08,963
Okay, it's your move now.

480
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:16,323
Anyone want some popcorn?

481
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:17,803
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

482
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:31,201
Fuck!

483
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:39,356
The pain...

484
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:41,396
...so unexpected and undeserved...

485
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:44,601
...had, for some reason,
cleared away the cobwebs.

486
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:48,763
I realized I didn't hate the cabinet door.

487
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:53,554
I hated my life, my house, my family...

488
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,919
- Are you okay, Daddy?
- What happened?

489
00:32:56,085 --> 00:32:58,121
...my backyard...

490
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:01,313
...my power mower.

491
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,440
Nothing would ever change.

492
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,881
Nothing new could ever be expected.

493
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:12,278
It had to end, and it did.

494
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:17,198
Now in the dark world where I dwell...

495
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:22,836
...ugly things and surprising things
and sometimes little wondrous things...

496
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:25,803
...spill out at me constantly...

497
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:29,200
...and I can count on nothing.

498
00:33:44,444 --> 00:33:45,559
Medfly, got it.

499
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,243
- That would be a Thelma Kornford.
- Oh, yeah, Miss Big-Tits.

500
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:50,884
If I had known it was harmless...

501
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:53,957
- ... I would have killed it myself.
- I would have killed it myself.

502
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,115
Thanks for the mammaries.

503
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,916
She had such beautiful...

504
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:02,554
Daddy slowpoke.

505
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:05,758
- Oh, get around him, will you?
- You know what to do. Your move.

506
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:07,836
That's a big ten-four.

507
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,483
Got nothing on us.

508
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,793
- There we go.
- Get a life!

509
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:14,318
Okay, Bob, no rush.

510
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:15,963
- Not so fast.
- You are flying.

511
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,797
Decelerate.

512
00:34:18,844 --> 00:34:19,994
Steady.

513
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:21,597
- Decelerate.
- Slow down.

514
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,603
- Jesus.
- Son of a bitch.

515
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:28,440
Come on. Decelerate!

516
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:39,153
Let us over.

517
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,083
It's an emergency.

518
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:43,838
We're getting over. Emergency.

519
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,994
- What the hell was that?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

520
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:53,121
What the hell in the hootenanny
was that?

521
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:56,597
The return spring
on the throttle cable, or...

522
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:57,992
Look, the gas.

523
00:34:58,364 --> 00:34:59,764
Was it cut or broken?

524
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,403
Let's give her a look.

525
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,438
Oh, my...

526
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:20,923
It's not the spring. It's the linkage
from the pedal to the carb. See?

527
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:25,760
It fell apart, so the gas pedal didn't push
back out when you took your foot off...

528
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:29,201
- ... but doesn't explain why...
- There is a safety override on the carb.

529
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,833
- When the linkage parts, it's...
- Why'd it part?

530
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,800
Shouldn't this ring
hold the cable in place?

531
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,195
I mean, how could it
just come off like that?

532
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,242
Let's have a look. Let's probe a little.

533
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:43,797
All right. This screw has been turned
all the way out, the idle screw.

534
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:47,476
So when the linkage parted, it went
the other way. Up instead of down.

535
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,719
Wait. Now, how could that happen?

536
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,882
There is no way that that screw...

537
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:55,956
...could turn itself all the way out
like that accidentally.

538
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,239
No way.

539
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:01,996
Motherfucker! They did it deliberately!

540
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:07,157
We almost died!
They almost fucking got us, man!

541
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:09,202
To loosen the lock ring
and nut assembly...

542
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:11,242
...that holds the linkage rods together...

543
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,918
...a special tool would be needed.
Several, in fact.

544
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,280
It'll take half an hour
to get this back together.

545
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,639
- I have the tools, though.
- Back at the house.

546
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:23,282
Correct. We can always go to
a repair center and borrow theirs...

547
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,719
...or get a tow truck out here.

548
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:36,043
Here.

549
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:42,954
You know, maybe that's what's
fucking us up, fucking up our brains.

550
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:46,954
- We're gonna wind up like Freck soon.
- No.

551
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,556
Okay, these are for us.

552
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,440
And I'm going to suggest that you take
several, with the implicit acceptance...

553
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:56,438
...of the fact that Substance D
cannot screw up an accelerator...

554
00:36:56,605 --> 00:37:00,280
- ... or a carb-idle adjustment.
- Yeah, dude. Don't blame the drugs.

555
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:03,925
- Come on.
- Well, so much for...

556
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,599
...our great road trip to San Diego, Bob.

557
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:09,278
I told you we should have gone
to San Francisco.

558
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,083
What, like going to San Francisco...

559
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:13,679
...would not have caused
this problem with the engine?

560
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:16,518
Yeah, because when you're going north,
it screws this way.

561
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:18,597
When you're going south,
it screws that way.

562
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:20,083
If we were in Australia.

563
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,842
This proves you got somebody
out to get you real bad, Bob.

564
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:34,519
I just hope the house is still there
when we get back.

565
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,039
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

566
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:38,878
- I wouldn't worry about it too much.
- You wouldn't?

567
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:42,356
Christ, they may have broken in
and ripped off all we got.

568
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:45,039
All Bob's got, anyhow.

569
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,514
What if they stomped the animals?

570
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:51,313
Don't worry about it.
I left a little surprise for them.

571
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,159
What?

572
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:57,603
Yes, anyone entering the house while we
were gone will receive a little surprise.

573
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,960
Little something I perfected
early this morning.

574
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,922
What kind of surprise?
It's my house, Jim.

575
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:05,521
You should ask me before
you start wiring up my house.

576
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:08,246
Why so uptight about
protecting your house from intruders?

577
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:09,679
Why would you care?

578
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:11,757
I'm just saying,
it's my house, that's all.

579
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:14,998
You can't start going around
booby-trapping my house.

580
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:18,362
Okay, okay. I mean, jeez.
Or as the Germans say, leise...

581
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:21,085
...which translates to "be cool".
Just be cool.

582
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:22,954
So, what did you do?

583
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,197
If the front door is opened
while we are in absentia...

584
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,324
...thumbnail-sized, auxiliary,
motion-detector...

585
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:31,635
...digital-memory cameras
start recording.

586
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:33,762
You should have told me.

587
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:37,202
What if they come in through
the back door or the bathroom window...

588
00:38:37,364 --> 00:38:39,003
...like that infamous Beatles' song?

589
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:41,885
To increase their chances of entering
via the front door...

590
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,719
...rather than in other less usual places...

591
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,240
...I, fortuitously,
left the front door unlocked.

592
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:51,159
- Suppose they don't know it's unlocked.
- That's why I left a note on the door.

593
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,396
- You're kidding me.
- No, no. No.

594
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,557
Yes. But no. But yes.

595
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:59,603
Are you bullshitting us or not?

596
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,916
I just simply never know with you.

597
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,077
- Is he fucking with us, Bob?
- We'll see when we get back.

598
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:09,204
If there's a note on the door and it's
unlocked, we'll know he isn't lying.

599
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:11,117
They'd probably take the note down...

600
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:13,561
...after ripping off
and vandalizing the house...

601
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,159
...and locking the door behind them,
so we don't know.

602
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:19,204
We will never know.
It's still that gray area.

603
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:21,833
Of course I'm kidding.
Only a psychotic would do that.

604
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,121
Leave the front door
unlocked with a note on it.

605
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:25,764
What'd you write
on the note, Jim?

606
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:28,918
I wrote, "Come on in,
the door's unlocked".

607
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:31,436
He did it. He really did it.

608
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,398
This is the only way we'll know
for sure who's been doing this.

609
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:36,920
And is that not what is
of primary importance?

610
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,920
Okay, I'm still gray here.
Now, did you do it or not?

611
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:42,961
Is it really that suspenseful?

612
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,036
- Did you?
- He did it.

613
00:39:45,204 --> 00:39:46,844
Doesn't matter.
We'll be home shortly.

614
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:49,041
- Did you?
- We'll be home presently.

615
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:35,876
Well, Barris, I can see you're right.

616
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:40,436
This scrupulous covering-over of all
the signs they would've otherwise left...

617
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,643
...testifies to their thoroughness.

618
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,239
You're an idiot.

619
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,195
Oh, wait, wait. This... What's that?

620
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,519
Come here, come here.
Look at this, look at this.

621
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:58,161
A still-hot cigarette butt. It sure is.
Wait a second.

622
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,596
They lit a joint
while they were here, Bob.

623
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:03,326
Fuck it. Barris is right,
there was somebody here.

624
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:05,077
This roach is still hot, smell it.

625
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:08,760
Yes. And that roach may not have
been left here by accident.

626
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,643
This evidence may not be a slip-up.

627
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:14,835
- So, what now?
- Maybe they were here specifically...

628
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,724
...to plant drugs in the house.

629
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:19,161
Setting us up,
then "phoning in a tip" later.

630
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,362
It could be in the phone,
the wall outlets.

631
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:24,324
We have to go through this house
and get it absolutely clean...

632
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:26,840
...before they phone us in,
unless they already have.

633
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,559
We might only have minutes.

634
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:32,440
You check the wall sockets.
I'll tear this phone apart.

635
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,518
Wait, hold on.
If they see us scrambling...

636
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:36,166
- ... before the raid...
- What raid?

637
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,521
If we're frantically trying to
flush their drugs...

638
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:41,483
...we can't allege, though true,
we didn't know they were here.

639
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:47,003
They're going to find us holding them,
or maybe that's part of the plan.

640
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:50,358
Shit, shit, shit.

641
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:54,518
We can't do anything.
We're fucked, man. Fuck.

642
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,079
- Fucked, man!
- Barris...

643
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:59,521
...what about the super-secret
surveillance cameras?

644
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,563
- The what?
- The doodads, man.

645
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:06,115
Oh, yes, of course. Right, of course.
How could I have forgotten?

646
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:09,193
This should be extremely informational
at this point.

647
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:13,916
I believe this will tell us a great deal.

648
00:42:18,646 --> 00:42:23,356
Although it probably wouldn't have
proven to be that important.

649
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:26,559
Let me guess: didn't record.

650
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:32,675
Allow me to suggest that it's highly
likely that the tow truck was bugged...

651
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:38,045
...thus affording them ample time and
opportunity to deploy an operative...

652
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:41,516
...to diffuse and otherwise erase
the evidence obtained.

653
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,204
But we have no other recourse,
in view of their evasive tactics.

654
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:49,153
There is, of course, one thing you could
do, Bob, although it would take time.

655
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:54,262
Sell the house and move out?

656
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:58,465
But hell, this is our home.

657
00:42:58,632 --> 00:42:59,827
You could make a profit.

658
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:03,222
On the other hand, you might have to
take a loss on a quick sale.

659
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,190
I know a good realtor.

660
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,505
What reason should I give for selling?
They always ask.

661
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:11,226
Can't tell the truth.
You shouldn't tell the truth...

662
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:13,188
Why can't we tell the truth?

663
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:15,820
We put an ad in the L.A. Times.

664
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:17,824
Modern, three-bedroom tract house...

665
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:20,460
...with two bathrooms
for easy and fast flushing...

666
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:24,465
...high-grade drugs stashed throughout
all rooms, included in sale price.

667
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:27,067
It could actually increase the value.

668
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,952
But they might call and ask
what kind of drugs are stashed...

669
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:32,068
...and we don't know,
it could be anything.

670
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:34,541
Prospective buyers might inquire
as to the quantity.

671
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,224
And we don't know at this point.

672
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:40,543
It could be ounces of weed or pounds of
heroin, or hits of E or killer caps of D.

673
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:42,748
Hey, you guys.

674
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:45,300
Fuck! Jesus.

675
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,501
What the fuck is wrong with you?

676
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:53,146
I came in, like the note said.

677
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:56,510
It didn't say when
you were gonna get back, so I just...

678
00:43:56,831 --> 00:44:01,461
I just sat around for a while
and ended up crashing.

679
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:04,306
- Love your sweater.
- Just... Don't touch me.

680
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:07,221
Man, you guys were
making so much noise.

681
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:09,782
- Sorry.
- It woke me up.

682
00:44:11,592 --> 00:44:14,186
Did you smoke a joint
before you crashed?

683
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:16,260
Yeah.

684
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,632
Otherwise, I can't ever sleep.

685
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:23,342
You know,
you guys should seriously think about...

686
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:26,231
...maybe locking the doors
when you leave.

687
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:30,141
Otherwise you could get ripped off
and it'd be your own fault.

688
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:32,349
This is all your fault.

689
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:36,346
Did I hear you say
you were gonna sell the house?

690
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,784
Or was that, you know, me dreaming?

691
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:42,148
Because what I heard sounded weird.

692
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,425
Yeah, we're all dreaming.

693
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:46,628
Quiet. Steady. Steady.

694
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:49,148
Kidney. Kidney. Kidney.

695
00:44:49,472 --> 00:44:53,148
So the information from the holo
scanners installed in Arctor's house...

696
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:57,862
...are transmitted back here,
to station 12-879.

697
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:02,108
This'll be your new
home away from home, pal.

698
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:04,987
It's pretty intuitive.

699
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:10,068
You'll just be watching and
scanning through recorded information.

700
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:14,429
You can go live, of course, but that
tends to be excruciatingly boring.

701
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:17,585
And then, you see
where these holos are placed?

702
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:21,871
What would be great is if they ever
need servicing or changing out...

703
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:24,626
...you could do that yourself
while no one else is around.

704
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:27,545
But wouldn't you then see me
on the tapes doing that?

705
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:30,101
No. For that, you just edit yourself out.

706
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:33,422
But be sure to include yourself
in the tapes from time to time...

707
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:36,027
...because if you systematically
edit yourself out...

708
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,070
...we can deduce who you are through
the process of elimination...

709
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:40,871
...whether we want to or not.

710
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:44,226
I'm not sure I exactly...

711
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,065
We take it for granted that you are
one of the individuals...

712
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:50,384
...that are in Arctor's circle
of roommates and friends...

713
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,065
...that frequent the house.

714
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:56,067
I mean, undoubtedly, you're either
Jim Barris or Ernie Luckman...

715
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:58,144
...Charles Freck...

716
00:45:58,753 --> 00:46:00,311
...even Arctor himself.

717
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,869
Hell, you could be Donna,
for all I know.

718
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:06,230
As my superior,
I figure you'd know all this stuff.

719
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:07,541
How the hell would I know?

720
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:10,068
I'm just a little guy behind a big desk.

721
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:14,463
You'd have to go way up the food chain
to access that kind of info.

722
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:17,306
You know, instead of me
doing any maintenance...

723
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:20,032
...send someone to the house
once a month, in uniform...

724
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:22,422
...and have him say, "Good morning.

725
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:24,661
I'm here to service
the monitoring devices...

726
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,030
...covertly installed on your premises".

727
00:46:29,032 --> 00:46:32,547
Maybe that sucker Arctor
would even pick up the bill.

728
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:37,309
Actually, I think Arctor would probably
kill the guy and then disappear.

729
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:41,146
If it's proven that Arctor is,
in fact, hiding that much.

730
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,864
Believe me, Arctor is hiding a great deal.

731
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:47,422
We've got more recent
information on him analyzed...

732
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:51,710
...and there's no doubt about it,
he's a ringer.

733
00:46:51,873 --> 00:46:55,023
A three-dollar bill. The guy is a phony.

734
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,990
So keep on him until he drops...

735
00:46:57,152 --> 00:47:00,030
...until we have enough to arrest him
and make it stick.

736
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:04,710
You think he's high up in the,
you know, Substance D network?

737
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:07,670
What we think is of
no importance to your work.

738
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:12,190
You report your limited conclusions,
and we evaluate.

739
00:47:12,353 --> 00:47:14,742
- You got it?
- Okay, okay.

740
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,505
I got it.

741
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:22,509
I'd say Arctor is doomed
if he's up to something.

742
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:28,023
And I have a hunch,
from what you're saying, that he is.

743
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:34,628
The idling jets could be replaced with
smaller jets that would compensate.

744
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:38,422
And with a tach, he could just watch
his rpms so it didn't over-rev.

745
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,867
Usually just backing off
on the gas pedal...

746
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:43,672
...causes it to upshift
if the automatic linkage doesn't.

747
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,789
What are you grease monkeys up to?

748
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,547
Bob's got a bent choke shaft.

749
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:51,025
- How much does this Impala weigh?
- Weighs about 1000 pounds.

750
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:54,423
Thousand pounds traveling at
80 miles per hour builds up a force of...

751
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:57,471
That's 1000 pounds with passengers
in it and a full tank of gas.

752
00:47:57,632 --> 00:48:00,021
- For a fact? Okay.
- How many passengers?

753
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,581
- Twelve.
- Six in the front, six in the back.

754
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:05,824
No, that's 11 in the back
and the driver sitting alone in the front.

755
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:08,666
Extra weight on the rear wheels
is to keep from fishtailing.

756
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,664
We talking about
1250-pound passengers?

757
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,791
- Kids' soccer team.
- Now, is that metal or plastic cleats?

758
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:16,990
- Metal cleats for safety.
- Okay, my computations are complete.

759
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:20,862
You are just heckle tweak,
but you are bug-bite squared.

760
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:23,751
- What kind of bug?
- About-to-get-fucked-up-bitch beetle.

761
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,063
- Hey, come on. Cool it, you guys.
- Tell me...

762
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:30,112
Step back. Freck-and-frack,
Ernie's on the attack.

763
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:31,831
- What is this?
- Come on.

764
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,588
- I'm desperately afraid.
- I'm gonna knock your nads...

765
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:37,550
...up into your nostrils
for talking to your betters that way.

766
00:48:37,713 --> 00:48:39,907
All right.
I'm a technician, you're an interloper.

767
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:43,224
You are constitutionally incapable
of not shutting the fuck up.

768
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:44,827
- Bring it!
- Shut the fuck up!

769
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:47,063
No, no, proctology boy,
I'm coming after you.

770
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:48,985
Shut it. Hey. Hey.

771
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:52,032
I have the perfect tool for this job.

772
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,623
- I was only kidding him.
- Fuck.

773
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:00,472
Fuck!

774
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:04,070
What if he goes in there
and he gets his gun and his silencer?

775
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,905
I'm leaving.
This place has become unsafe.

776
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:11,347
No, hey, hey, Freck. No, come on.
You're a bro, man. Stick around.

777
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:17,143
What's the hammer for, Barris?

778
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:21,021
No, I just saw it inside and thought I,
you know, should bring it along with me.

779
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:26,427
- Same with this.
- You ready?

780
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:28,027
Yeah, what do you want?

781
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:29,592
- Come on, hammerhead.
- Shut up.

782
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:31,186
- Make a move.
- Don't like it.

783
00:49:31,353 --> 00:49:34,822
Okay. If you guys are gonna
kill each other, I'm splitting.

784
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,586
- It's getting very fucked up over here.
- Hey, Freck.

785
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:41,108
The most dangerous kind of person is
the one who's afraid of his own shadow.

786
00:49:41,554 --> 00:49:43,829
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'll tell you.

787
00:49:43,992 --> 00:49:46,268
It means that if you take
too much of that stuff...

788
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:48,344
...you not only start seeing
bugs all over...

789
00:49:48,514 --> 00:49:51,231
...but you start talking like... and
no one can understand you.

790
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:53,588
What'd you say, Barris?
I didn't understand.

791
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,507
See, you guys are fucked up.

792
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:59,552
No, no, it is y-uck-uck-ou
that are fuck-ucked-ed up.

793
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,782
Hey, go Freck yourself.

794
00:50:01,954 --> 00:50:04,023
Don't take the car, you'll kill yourself.

795
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:17,509
So this guy's been going around claiming
to be a world-famous impostor, right?

796
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:22,065
Says he's posed, at one time or another,
as a surgeon at John Hopkins...

797
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:24,666
...as a theoretical,
submolecular, high-velocity...

798
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:28,065
...particle-research physicist
on a federal grant at Harvard...

799
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:32,228
...as a Finnish novelist
who won the Nobel Prize for literature...

800
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,510
...as a deposed Argentinean president...

801
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:37,311
...who was married to a go-go dancer
from Chicago...

802
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:39,351
He got away with all that?

803
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:42,387
- He never got caught?
- Okay, you broke my flow...

804
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:45,146
...so now I guess I'll just have
to segue down to the near.

805
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:47,748
That's just it.
You see, he didn't pose as any of those.

806
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:51,668
He just posed as
a world-famous impostor. Yeah.

807
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,472
It came out later in the L.A. Times.

808
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:57,181
They checked up, and he was pushing
a broom at Disneyland or something.

809
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:58,945
He saw that old DiCaprio movie.

810
00:50:59,112 --> 00:51:02,423
You know, the one where
he plays a world-famous impostor...

811
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,471
...before Leonardo hit his Elvis stage.

812
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:05,782
And his first thought was:

813
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:09,503
"Hey, I could pose as all those
exotic guys and get away with it".

814
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:12,028
But then, his next thought was,
"Hell, why bother?

815
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:16,472
I could just pose as an impostor,
and it'd be a lot easier".

816
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:19,864
They say that he made more money
than the actual impostor...

817
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:24,822
...although I'm not sure
if they'd adjust for inflation.

818
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:28,181
Well, you know,
we all see impostors now and then...

819
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:31,027
...but not posing
as subatomic physicists.

820
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:33,791
Oh, as a narc, you mean.

821
00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:35,545
What's a narc look like?

822
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,750
That's like asking,
"What's an impostor look like?"

823
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:40,871
I talked to this dealer
who'd been busted.

824
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,672
I asked him what the narc
who busted him looked like.

825
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,983
What did he say, he looked just like us?

826
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:48,746
More so.

827
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:51,222
So I guess the moral of that is...

828
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:55,067
...stay away from guys
looking the same as us.

829
00:51:58,393 --> 00:52:00,190
Well, there are female narcs.

830
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:02,309
Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those.

831
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:06,228
No, I don't mean a female. I mean
just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.

832
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:10,103
Sure. So you could positively know.
And you will.

833
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:13,471
When he slaps the cuffs on, you'll know
for sure, when that day comes.

834
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,385
How could a guy do that?

835
00:52:15,554 --> 00:52:16,987
Pose as a narc?

836
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:18,827
- What?
- What?

837
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:21,385
Pose as a narc?

838
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:24,431
- No, you said it. So yeah.
- Pose as a narc.

839
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:29,431
Oh, sh... Shit, I'm spaced.

840
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:31,346
Pose as a narc, wow.

841
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:34,422
Pose as a narc.

842
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,623
My brains are scrambled today.

843
00:53:57,353 --> 00:53:58,911
Christ, Barris, what the fuck?

844
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:17,472
Yes, hi. How are you?

845
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:20,068
I have something
somewhat emergent to report.

846
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,273
I don't know if I should be summoning
the inhalator squad...

847
00:54:24,434 --> 00:54:26,503
...or the resuscitation squad.

848
00:54:27,313 --> 00:54:28,507
Yes, ma 'am?

849
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:31,313
I don't know. I don't want to say
it's not cardiac arrest...

850
00:54:31,474 --> 00:54:35,831
...but it's either that or an involuntary
asphyxiation of a bolus within the...

851
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,074
The address, yes.
The address is simple...

852
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,668
...although I've never sent myself
a piece of mail here.

853
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:45,621
Seven... Seven... Seven-zero-niner.
Street? Is the street relevant?

854
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:48,150
- Come on.
- Tell you this much, it is a cul-de-sac.

855
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:51,550
Does that technically qualify as a street?

856
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:54,786
I'm pleased to report we won't
be needing your assistance after all.

857
00:54:54,954 --> 00:54:56,945
Thank you. Have a nice day.

858
00:54:57,313 --> 00:55:00,112
There you go. Took care of itself.

859
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:02,983
- Okay.
- Oh, Jesus.

860
00:55:03,153 --> 00:55:05,349
You all right? There you go.

861
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,072
I must've passed out.

862
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:10,590
- Yeah.
- Well, you... I was dreaming.

863
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:13,304
- Must have almost died.
- Yeah.

864
00:55:13,474 --> 00:55:14,907
Shit.

865
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:20,193
And what were you doing while
I was being escorted by dead relatives...

866
00:55:20,355 --> 00:55:22,389
...to the bright light? Jacking off?

867
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:24,431
No, no, no. You saw me.
I was on the phone.

868
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:25,992
I summoned the paramedics.

869
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:29,543
- I sprung into action without delay.
- Bullshit. You were cleaning your pipe.

870
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:31,670
I was wrapping my pipe.
You were unconscious.

871
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:35,224
You the only person in the universe who
never heard of the Heimlich maneuver?

872
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:37,744
All right,
I'm gonna give you a little feedback...

873
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:41,702
...since you seem to be proceeding
through life like a cat without whiskers...

874
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:44,389
...perpetually caught
behind the refrigerator.

875
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:47,304
Your life and watching you live it...

876
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:50,114
...is like a gag reel
of ineffective bodily functions.

877
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:54,153
I swear to God that a toddler
has a better understanding...

878
00:55:54,315 --> 00:55:56,670
...of the intricacies of
chew, swallow, digest...

879
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,190
...don't kill yourself on your TV dinner.

880
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:02,427
And yet, you've managed to
turn this near-death fuck-up of yours...

881
00:56:02,594 --> 00:56:04,233
...into a moral referendum on me.

882
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,827
- You are a monster!
- Oh, fuck.

883
00:56:06,994 --> 00:56:09,746
- You are a billy goat.
- A sick, depraved un...

884
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:17,628
Charles Freck, becoming progressively
more and more depressed...

885
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:21,469
...by what was happening around him,
decided finally to off himself.

886
00:56:21,635 --> 00:56:24,023
There was no problem
in the circles where he hung out...

887
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:25,626
...in putting an end to yourself.

888
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:27,750
You just bought a large quantity
of downers...

889
00:56:27,914 --> 00:56:29,746
...and took them with cheap wine.

890
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:32,030
The planning part had to do
with the artifacts...

891
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:35,072
...he wanted found on him
by later archeologists.

892
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:37,306
He had spent several days deciding...

893
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:41,023
...much longer than he had spent
deciding to kill himself.

894
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:43,389
He would be found lying on his back
on his bed...

895
00:56:43,554 --> 00:56:45,909
...with a copy of Ayn Rand's
The Fountainhead...

896
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:47,871
...and an unfinished letter to Exxon...

897
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:51,106
...protesting the cancellation
of his gas credit card.

898
00:56:51,273 --> 00:56:54,585
That way, he would indict the system
and achieve something by his death...

899
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:57,632
...over and above
what the death itself achieved.

900
00:56:58,074 --> 00:57:00,907
At the last moment, he changed his mind
on a decisive issue...

901
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:03,871
...and decided to drink the pills
with a connoisseur wine...

902
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,989
...instead of Ripple or Thunderbird.

903
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:09,112
So he set off on one last drive,
over to Tiny's Liquors...

904
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:10,913
...which specialized in fine wines...

905
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:13,907
...and bought a bottle
of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot...

906
00:57:14,074 --> 00:57:15,871
...which set him back almost $ 70.

907
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:22,746
Back home again, he uncorked the wine,
let it breathe, drank a few glasses of it...

908
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:25,632
...and tried to think
of something meaningful, but could not.

909
00:57:25,793 --> 00:57:29,469
And then, with a glass of merlot,
gulped down all the pills at once.

910
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:33,784
However, he had been burned.

911
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:39,108
Instead of quietly suffocating,
Charles Freck began to hallucinate.

912
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:41,947
The next thing he knew,
a creature from between dimensions...

913
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:45,869
...was standing beside his bed,
looking down at him disapprovingly.

914
00:57:47,393 --> 00:57:48,873
You're gonna read me my sins?

915
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,425
It's gonna take 100,000 hours?

916
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:59,670
Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly,
in shifts, throughout eternity.

917
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,750
The list will never end.

918
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:06,791
"The Sins of Freck".

919
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:10,463
Charles Freck wished he could take back
the last half-hour of his life.

920
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:13,831
"Age 6, in the first grade:
theft of fingernail clippers.

921
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:15,713
3:08 p. m. Theft.

922
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:18,947
You did knowingly and with malice
punch your baby sister, Evelyn.

923
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:20,184
Kicking the dog.

924
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:22,949
December: theft of Christmas presents.

925
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:25,389
One million lies. Destruction of..."

926
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:28,228
One thousand years later,
they had reached the sixth grade...

927
00:58:28,394 --> 00:58:30,271
...the year he had discovered
masturbation.

928
00:58:30,434 --> 00:58:33,393
"November 14th: Percodan.

929
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:35,306
Vicodin. Cocaine".

930
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,911
Charles Freck thought,
"At least I got a good wine".

931
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:42,150
Where did Substance D come from?

932
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:43,668
Why can't we stop it?

933
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:46,746
The bigger this war gets,
the more freedoms we lose...

934
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,509
...the more Substance D
is on our streets.

935
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:51,233
Can't you figure this out?

936
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,829
Look around you.
Look how far we've come.

937
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:56,349
Humanity wasn't meant to live like this.

938
00:58:56,514 --> 00:59:00,349
Our every waking moment
tracked and traced and scanned.

939
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:02,471
It's time to stop
submitting to this tyranny.

940
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:05,387
It's time to realize
that we're being enslaved.

941
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:08,193
It's our tax dollars at work.
Protect us from ourselves.

942
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:10,072
Hey, guys, I used to be one of you.

943
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:12,351
Stop selling out your own species.

944
00:59:21,954 --> 00:59:24,344
Hey. Get in.

945
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:27,867
You scared me.

946
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:30,150
Got something for you.

947
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:35,184
I'm seeing some crazy shit tonight.

948
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:37,148
What do you mean?

949
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:39,385
That fucking Barris.

950
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:41,385
You know how he works?

951
00:59:41,635 --> 00:59:43,148
He doesn't kill anybody...

952
00:59:43,315 --> 00:59:46,909
...but he hangs around until
the situation arises where they die.

953
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:51,105
And then he just sits there.

954
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:56,190
And he sort of sets them up
in the first place while he stays out of it.

955
00:59:56,355 --> 00:59:59,744
But I'm not sure how.

956
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:03,463
Hey, do you have that money
for the stuff? I need it tonight.

957
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:06,786
- Yeah. I have it.
- Okay.

958
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:10,264
You know, I don't like Barris.

959
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:12,027
And I don't trust him.

960
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:13,833
Guy's fucking crazy.

961
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:16,226
And when you're around him,
you start acting crazy.

962
01:00:16,394 --> 01:00:18,909
And then when you're not around him,
you're fine.

963
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,907
You're acting crazy now.

964
01:00:22,074 --> 01:00:24,952
- I am?
- Yes.

965
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:31,309
Hey, will you take me to a concert
next weekend at Anaheim Stadium?

966
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:32,590
Sure.

967
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,585
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

968
01:00:36,114 --> 01:00:38,106
Yeah. Which night?

969
01:00:38,275 --> 01:00:40,550
It's Sunday afternoon.

970
01:00:43,034 --> 01:00:44,990
Whatever you want.

971
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:49,632
Well, I'll just drive over to my place.

972
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:52,184
You have the money,
you'll give it to me.

973
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:54,744
We'll kick back, drop some Death...

974
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:57,382
...maybe get some tequila.

975
01:00:59,195 --> 01:01:00,833
All right.

976
01:01:03,715 --> 01:01:05,831
All right.

977
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,394
Hey, Donna, do you like cats?

978
01:01:12,755 --> 01:01:15,110
Drippy little things.

979
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:19,393
Moving along
about a foot above the ground.

980
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,146
Above?

981
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:24,664
You mean, on the ground?

982
01:01:24,835 --> 01:01:27,269
Just dripping...

983
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,789
...behind furniture.

984
01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:34,742
Little spring flowers with blue in them
that come up first.

985
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:36,867
Yeah.

986
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:39,105
- Before the...
- Before someone stomps on them...

987
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,503
...and they're all gone.

988
01:01:42,876 --> 01:01:44,512
It's like you know me.

989
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:48,304
You can read me.

990
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,434
Can I put my arms around you?

991
01:01:57,554 --> 01:01:59,545
- I wanna hug you, okay?
- No.

992
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:03,184
- What?
- Look, I do a lot of coke, okay?

993
01:02:03,355 --> 01:02:06,027
I just have to be really careful
because I do a lot of coke.

994
01:02:06,195 --> 01:02:08,628
So just leave my body alone, okay?

995
01:02:09,594 --> 01:02:11,074
Okay.

996
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:13,949
Sure.

997
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:15,628
Yeah.

998
01:02:17,954 --> 01:02:21,344
You know, fuck it.

999
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,672
Hey, I... I'm sorry.

1000
01:02:23,835 --> 01:02:25,985
I just don't like it
when people grope my body...

1001
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:29,306
...and I have to watch out for that
because I snort so much coke.

1002
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:31,706
That's fucking lame. I gotta go.

1003
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:33,150
Your car's not fixed.

1004
01:02:34,516 --> 01:02:36,710
I drove you here, I'll drive you back.

1005
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:39,990
Bob.

1006
01:02:42,394 --> 01:02:44,112
Bob.

1007
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:47,748
Bob, wait.

1008
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,427
Please.

1009
01:02:49,596 --> 01:02:51,108
Please wait.

1010
01:02:51,275 --> 01:02:54,710
I didn't mean... I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

1011
01:02:54,876 --> 01:02:57,309
I'm just... I'm so out of it right now.

1012
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:00,945
I... Sometimes after I've worked
really hard all day, I...

1013
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,434
Please, come back.

1014
01:03:02,596 --> 01:03:04,791
Come on. With the tequila.

1015
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:07,347
How much do you do?

1016
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:14,110
Not that much.
And I don't shoot up.

1017
01:03:14,275 --> 01:03:16,344
I never have and I never will. I...

1018
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:20,268
Once you start shooting,
you got like six months, maybe.

1019
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:21,869
And even tap water.

1020
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,706
You get a habit.

1021
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,672
You have a habit.

1022
01:03:27,115 --> 01:03:28,708
We all do.

1023
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:32,106
I mean, so what? What's the difference?

1024
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,311
I'm happy.

1025
01:03:34,474 --> 01:03:37,228
- Aren't you happy?
- Listen to me.

1026
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,192
I think it's starting to get bad.

1027
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:49,628
You know what
I wanna do someday, Bob?

1028
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:53,469
I wanna move north, live on a farm...

1029
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:57,786
...near the mountains, in a cabin.

1030
01:03:57,956 --> 01:03:59,547
Can I go with you?

1031
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:02,992
I hope so.

1032
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:06,666
I hope so.

1033
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:26,309
All right. You weren't kidding.

1034
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:47,831
Do you have a toothbrush?

1035
01:04:47,994 --> 01:04:49,474
What?

1036
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,228
Well, screw it. Screw it.

1037
01:04:51,396 --> 01:04:52,987
Teeth are teeth.

1038
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:55,952
I'll... I'll brush them.

1039
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:02,512
Know where the bathroom is?

1040
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:05,427
What bathroom?

1041
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,188
In the house.

1042
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,025
Who are those guys out there?

1043
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:16,663
Rolling joints and rattling on and on?

1044
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:18,869
They live here with you?

1045
01:05:19,036 --> 01:05:20,788
Two of them do.

1046
01:05:22,036 --> 01:05:24,072
So you're gay?

1047
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:28,228
Try not to be.
That's why I called you tonight.

1048
01:05:28,396 --> 01:05:31,353
So you're putting up
a pretty good battle against it.

1049
01:05:32,114 --> 01:05:33,947
You better believe it.

1050
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:36,914
Guess I'm about to find out.

1051
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:41,945
If you're a latent gay, then
you'll want me to take the initiative.

1052
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:44,266
You want me to undress you?

1053
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:45,949
Sure.

1054
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:39,228
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

1055
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:57,146
Hello?

1056
01:06:57,315 --> 01:07:01,275
Fred, we've processed
some more recent material on you.

1057
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:03,505
How are you feeling?

1058
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,588
Okay.

1059
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:07,833
Any problems?

1060
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,032
Well, I had a fight with my girl.

1061
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:11,389
Any confusion?

1062
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:16,550
Are you experiencing any difficulty
identifying persons or objects?

1063
01:07:16,715 --> 01:07:18,911
Any language disorientation?

1064
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,509
No.

1065
01:07:20,876 --> 01:07:22,945
Can you come back over to room 203?

1066
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:26,391
What did you find to be a problem?

1067
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:28,467
We'll take that up when you get here.

1068
01:08:31,355 --> 01:08:32,835
Connie.

1069
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:36,314
Donna.

1070
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:05,908
All right, Fred. Very good.

1071
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:09,307
And this next test,
with your eyes covered...

1072
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:13,024
...reach out and feel an object
with each hand.

1073
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:16,189
You are to tell us if the object
presented to your left hand...

1074
01:09:16,355 --> 01:09:18,951
...is identical to the object
presented to your right.

1075
01:09:43,275 --> 01:09:44,948
One more thing, Fred.

1076
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:46,753
We need an updated blood test.

1077
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:50,068
So go down the hall to the
pathology lab, and they'll fix you up.

1078
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:53,672
And by the time you get back, we should
almost be through with our evaluation.

1079
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:55,427
I'll be upstairs with Hank.

1080
01:09:55,596 --> 01:09:57,632
You certainly seem
much more depressed today...

1081
01:09:57,796 --> 01:09:59,752
...than you did when we first saw you.

1082
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,470
Pardon?

1083
01:10:04,636 --> 01:10:08,073
Last week, when we first saw you,
you were kidding and laughing.

1084
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:10,273
Did you ever get her the flowers?

1085
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:20,465
Crazy job they gave me.

1086
01:10:20,636 --> 01:10:23,515
But if I wasn't doing it,
someone else would be.

1087
01:10:23,676 --> 01:10:25,587
And they might get it wrong.

1088
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:29,988
They might set Arctor up,
plant drugs on him and collect a reward.

1089
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:33,752
Better it be me,
despite the disadvantages.

1090
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:38,546
Just protecting everyone from Barris
is justification in itself.

1091
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:42,592
What the hell am I talking about?

1092
01:10:42,756 --> 01:10:44,189
I must be nuts.

1093
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:47,506
I know Bob Arctor. He's a good person.

1094
01:10:48,837 --> 01:10:52,954
He's up to nothing.
At least, nothing too bad.

1095
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,466
In fact, he works for the Orange County
Sheriff's Office covertly...

1096
01:10:58,636 --> 01:11:01,947
...which is probably why
Barris is after him.

1097
01:11:03,235 --> 01:11:04,465
But that wouldn't explain...

1098
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:07,390
...why the Orange County
Sheriff's Office is after him.

1099
01:11:09,956 --> 01:11:13,743
Something big is definitely
going down in this house.

1100
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:17,796
This rundown, rubble-filled house...

1101
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:19,753
...with its weed-patch yard...

1102
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,430
...and cat box that never gets emptied.

1103
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:25,430
What a waste of a truly good house.

1104
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:28,190
So much could be done with it.

1105
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:31,350
A family and children could live here.

1106
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:33,587
It was designed for that.

1107
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,235
Such a waste.

1108
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:39,225
They ought to confiscate it
and put it to better use.

1109
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:54,594
I'm supposed to act like they aren't here.

1110
01:11:54,756 --> 01:11:57,715
Assuming there's a "they" at all.

1111
01:11:58,197 --> 01:12:01,074
It may just be my imagination.

1112
01:12:01,356 --> 01:12:03,917
Whatever it is that's watching...

1113
01:12:04,077 --> 01:12:06,113
...it's not human...

1114
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:08,837
...unlike little dark-eyed Donna.

1115
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:11,386
It doesn't ever blink.

1116
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,591
What does a scanner see?

1117
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:17,712
Into the head?

1118
01:12:18,117 --> 01:12:20,346
Down into the heart?

1119
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:24,106
Does it see into me, into us?

1120
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:26,346
Clearly or darkly?

1121
01:12:27,796 --> 01:12:32,188
I hope it sees clearly, because
I can't any longer see into myself.

1122
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:34,587
I see only murk.

1123
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:38,752
I hope for everyone's sake
the scanners do better.

1124
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:42,984
Because if the scanner sees only darkly,
the way I do...

1125
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:47,149
...then I'm cursed and cursed again.

1126
01:12:47,317 --> 01:12:50,114
And we'll only wind up dead this way...

1127
01:12:50,277 --> 01:12:56,068
...knowing very little and getting
that little fragment wrong too.

1128
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,068
You show what we regard...

1129
01:13:03,237 --> 01:13:07,435
...more as competition phenomenon
than impairment.

1130
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:08,985
Yeah?

1131
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:12,948
Competition between the left and
the right hemispheres of your brain.

1132
01:13:13,117 --> 01:13:15,914
It's like you have two signals
that interfere with each other...

1133
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:18,466
...by carrying conflicting information.

1134
01:13:18,637 --> 01:13:21,230
It's as if you have two fuel gauges
on your car.

1135
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,274
They're studying
the same amount of fuel...

1136
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:26,587
...but one says your tank is full,
the other registers empty.

1137
01:13:26,756 --> 01:13:27,984
They can't both be right.

1138
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:31,627
And you as the driver have only
an indirect relationship to the fuel tank...

1139
01:13:31,796 --> 01:13:33,115
...via the gauges.

1140
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:36,033
So, what does all this mean?

1141
01:13:36,396 --> 01:13:38,627
Well, I'm sure you know already.

1142
01:13:38,796 --> 01:13:42,585
You've been experiencing it
without knowing why or what it is.

1143
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:46,277
Two hemispheres of my brain...

1144
01:13:46,877 --> 01:13:48,195
...are competing?

1145
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:50,114
- Yes.
- Yes.

1146
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:54,988
But why?

1147
01:13:55,157 --> 01:13:56,555
Substance D.

1148
01:13:56,716 --> 01:14:00,551
It often causes that, functionally,
and this is what the tests confirm.

1149
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:03,675
Damage has taken place to the
normally dominant left hemisphere...

1150
01:14:03,837 --> 01:14:06,270
...and the right hemisphere
is attempting to compensate.

1151
01:14:06,436 --> 01:14:07,791
Crosscutting, we call it...

1152
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:09,993
...related to split-brain phenomenon.

1153
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:14,115
We could perform
a right hemispherectomy...

1154
01:14:14,436 --> 01:14:15,711
...but I'd...

1155
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:18,311
Will this ever go away?

1156
01:14:19,117 --> 01:14:21,426
Probably. It's a functional impairment.

1157
01:14:21,597 --> 01:14:24,634
It may be organic damage.

1158
01:14:24,797 --> 01:14:26,275
It may be permanent.

1159
01:14:26,436 --> 01:14:30,395
Time will tell, and only after you've
been off Substance D for a long while.

1160
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:36,516
I'll never take Substance D again
for the rest of my life.

1161
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:39,113
How much are you taking now?

1162
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:40,470
Not much.

1163
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:44,029
More, recently, because of job stress.

1164
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,234
Death is swallowed up in victory.

1165
01:14:55,396 --> 01:14:58,595
Behold, I tell you the sacred secret now:

1166
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:01,795
You shall not all sleep in death.

1167
01:15:06,037 --> 01:15:08,791
We'll do the other half
of Southern California tomorrow night.

1168
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:12,234
The Air Force arsenal at Vandenberg
will be hit for automatic weapons...

1169
01:15:12,398 --> 01:15:15,274
What about that anthrax
Anwar ripped off for us?

1170
01:15:15,438 --> 01:15:18,907
When do we...? Aren't we supposed to
carry the stuff to the watershed area...?

1171
01:15:19,078 --> 01:15:20,395
We need the weapons first.

1172
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:22,945
Drugs in the water supply is step B.

1173
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,551
Okay, but I gotta go. I got a customer.

1174
01:15:25,716 --> 01:15:28,185
I can also identify
the aforementioned terrorist cell.

1175
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:30,952
It's indicated throughout the course
of my observations.

1176
01:15:31,118 --> 01:15:34,712
Do you have any more material of this
sort, or is this tape substantially it?

1177
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:36,469
No, I have a veritable cornucopia...

1178
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:40,153
...and much of it is directly referencing
the organization and its directives.

1179
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:42,877
Who are these people?
What organization?

1180
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:45,916
It is primarily Arctor and Hawthorne.

1181
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:49,229
I have coded notes here, which may be
of some interest to you.

1182
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:53,948
I... My own cryptology
is very difficult to...

1183
01:15:54,118 --> 01:15:56,869
As of now I'm impounding all of this.

1184
01:15:57,037 --> 01:16:00,394
It is our property temporarily,
and we will sort through it ourselves.

1185
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:04,631
You will be on hand
to explain anything to us...

1186
01:16:04,796 --> 01:16:08,869
...if and when we get to the point where
we feel we need anything explained.

1187
01:16:09,037 --> 01:16:14,237
Mr. Barris, you will not be released
pending our study of this material.

1188
01:16:14,396 --> 01:16:18,072
You will be charged, as a formality,
to keep you available...

1189
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,594
...with knowingly giving the authorities
false information.

1190
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:25,750
This, of course, is just a pretext
for your own safety.

1191
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:28,795
I always wanted to go
to the Galapagos...

1192
01:16:28,957 --> 01:16:31,551
- Is that satisfactory, Mr. Barris?
- Not entirely.

1193
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:33,470
Though I wonder,
when I'm locked down...

1194
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:37,153
...may I be provided with some lotion,
and perhaps some...?

1195
01:16:43,716 --> 01:16:48,666
So, what do you think
of Barris' evidence?

1196
01:16:50,556 --> 01:16:54,186
Seems like what he played...
The little we heard anyway.

1197
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:56,667
...sounded pretty genuine to me.

1198
01:16:56,837 --> 01:17:00,432
It's fake. Worthless.

1199
01:17:00,597 --> 01:17:02,189
Made on a home computer.

1200
01:17:02,757 --> 01:17:04,554
Maybe you're right.

1201
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:08,996
Is that my medical report
you have there?

1202
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:10,556
Yep.

1203
01:17:11,516 --> 01:17:12,837
What does it say?

1204
01:17:14,278 --> 01:17:16,507
That you're completely bonkers.

1205
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:20,029
Completely?

1206
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:24,831
There's maybe two brain cells
that still light up.

1207
01:17:24,997 --> 01:17:26,748
Rest is just...

1208
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:29,306
...short circuits and sparks.

1209
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,149
Two?

1210
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:38,149
Listen, when you go to pick up
your next paycheck...

1211
01:17:38,318 --> 01:17:41,787
...there will be a substantial difference
this time.

1212
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,916
I get some sort of bonus for this...?

1213
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:49,707
For this having happened to me on duty?

1214
01:17:49,877 --> 01:17:52,789
No. Read your penal code.

1215
01:17:52,957 --> 01:17:57,395
"An officer who willingly becomes an
addict and doesn't report it promptly...

1216
01:17:57,556 --> 01:17:59,594
...is subject to a misdemeanor charge...

1217
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:02,595
...a fine, and/or six months".

1218
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:05,752
You'll probably just be fined.

1219
01:18:05,917 --> 01:18:07,350
Willingly?

1220
01:18:08,478 --> 01:18:11,548
No one held a gun to your head
and shot you up.

1221
01:18:11,717 --> 01:18:13,628
No one dropped something in your soup.

1222
01:18:13,797 --> 01:18:16,708
You knowingly and willingly
took an addictive drug...

1223
01:18:16,877 --> 01:18:19,186
...brain-destructive and disorienting.

1224
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:20,837
I had to.

1225
01:18:21,278 --> 01:18:23,632
You could have pretended to.

1226
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:26,311
Most officers manage to cope with it.

1227
01:18:27,717 --> 01:18:32,507
And from the quantities
you were taking...

1228
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:36,033
My God, Fred, I...

1229
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:39,872
Hey, you know what I would do
if I were you?

1230
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:43,229
Once you get out of New Path and,
you know, it's all over...

1231
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:45,274
But it may never be over.

1232
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,672
Cigarette?

1233
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:53,274
I'm getting off that too. Everything.

1234
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:56,228
Including chocolate. Yeah.

1235
01:18:57,118 --> 01:18:58,631
And...

1236
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:00,670
Like I tell my kids...

1237
01:19:02,478 --> 01:19:05,355
I've got two kids. Two girls.

1238
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:07,345
Little ones.

1239
01:19:10,118 --> 01:19:12,426
I don't believe you do.

1240
01:19:14,318 --> 01:19:16,354
You're not supposed to.

1241
01:19:17,518 --> 01:19:18,792
Maybe not.

1242
01:19:38,759 --> 01:19:42,273
Listen, is there anywhere specific
you'd like to go?

1243
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:46,675
Maybe over to
Donna Hawthorne's place?

1244
01:19:46,837 --> 01:19:51,195
From the information you brought in,
sounds like you guys are pretty close.

1245
01:19:53,637 --> 01:19:55,435
Yes, we are.

1246
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:57,826
How'd you know that?

1247
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:00,957
Process of elimination.

1248
01:20:02,118 --> 01:20:03,436
I know who you aren't...

1249
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:06,438
...and we're talking about
a very small group of people...

1250
01:20:06,597 --> 01:20:08,792
...that we hoped would lead us higher.

1251
01:20:08,957 --> 01:20:10,630
And maybe Barris will.

1252
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:14,592
I pieced it together a long time ago
that you're Arctor.

1253
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,755
I'm who?

1254
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:24,675
I'm Bob Arctor?

1255
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:30,712
Yeah, get me
Donna Hawthorne's number...

1256
01:20:30,877 --> 01:20:33,153
...or just patch me through
when you locate her.

1257
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:35,231
Thanks.

1258
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:38,833
Bud, you are in a very bad way,
my friend.

1259
01:20:38,997 --> 01:20:40,909
Maybe Jim Barris poisoned you.

1260
01:20:41,078 --> 01:20:43,591
We're really interested in Barris,
not you.

1261
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:47,228
The whole scanning of the house
was to keep an eye on him.

1262
01:20:47,398 --> 01:20:52,551
We hoped to draw him here, and we did.

1263
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:57,350
He is deep into it
with some very dangerous people.

1264
01:20:58,677 --> 01:21:02,114
Then I'm a what?

1265
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:04,632
Well, we had to get to Barris
to set him up.

1266
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:06,835
So how we arranged it was...

1267
01:21:06,997 --> 01:21:09,831
...he grew progressively
more and more suspicious...

1268
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:11,716
...that you were an undercover cop...

1269
01:21:11,877 --> 01:21:14,268
...trying to nail him
or use him to get high or...

1270
01:21:14,438 --> 01:21:17,668
So he did what you or anyone
would have done.

1271
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:19,028
Hey, Donna.

1272
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:23,106
Yeah, hi, this is a buddy of Bob's.
Arctor.

1273
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:25,311
Yeah.

1274
01:21:25,478 --> 01:21:29,516
Listen, he's in a... He's in a bad way.

1275
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:32,988
Yeah, way bad.

1276
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:36,993
I was wondering if I could
ask a favor of you.

1277
01:21:38,037 --> 01:21:39,233
You're a sweetheart.

1278
01:21:39,797 --> 01:21:43,269
Yeah, I'm sure he'll
appreciate it very much.

1279
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:45,828
Great, thanks. Good news.

1280
01:21:45,997 --> 01:21:49,911
Donna Hawthorne said she'd pick you up
out front in about five minutes.

1281
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:54,952
You fuckers.

1282
01:22:52,398 --> 01:22:54,912
You're a good man, Bob.

1283
01:22:55,478 --> 01:22:57,752
You've been dealt a bad deal.

1284
01:22:57,918 --> 01:23:01,672
This is not fair, but it has to be this way.

1285
01:23:01,838 --> 01:23:03,065
You just...

1286
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:07,152
You gotta... You gotta just wait it out,
just get through it.

1287
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:09,354
And someday...

1288
01:23:09,837 --> 01:23:12,306
...a long time from now...

1289
01:23:12,838 --> 01:23:14,556
...you'll see the way you saw before.

1290
01:23:15,759 --> 01:23:18,431
There'll be a recognition...

1291
01:23:18,599 --> 01:23:23,719
...and some spark in a disguised form...

1292
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:25,835
...will reveal itself to you...

1293
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,913
...and guide you.

1294
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:55,672
- Substance D?
- Yeah.

1295
01:23:56,319 --> 01:23:58,115
Ate his head.

1296
01:23:58,278 --> 01:23:59,997
Another loser.

1297
01:24:00,838 --> 01:24:02,475
It's easy to win.

1298
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:06,110
Anybody can win.

1299
01:24:14,478 --> 01:24:16,150
Goodbye.

1300
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:28,118
Living and unliving things
are exchanging properties.

1301
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:34,192
The drive of unliving things is stronger
than the drive of living things.

1302
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:41,314
The living should never be used
to serve the purposes of the dead.

1303
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:46,637
But the dead should, if possible...

1304
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:50,109
...serve the purposes of the living.

1305
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:06,952
Hey, good news.

1306
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:09,427
I think I got you transferred
to one of our farms.

1307
01:25:09,798 --> 01:25:12,711
- Can I work with animals?
- I think you'll be working with plants...

1308
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:15,551
...for a while. In the open,
where you can touch the ground.

1309
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:18,631
- I wanna be with something living.
- The ground is living.

1310
01:25:18,798 --> 01:25:20,835
The earth is still alive.

1311
01:25:20,998 --> 01:25:23,512
Do you have
any agricultural background?

1312
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,112
I worked in an office.

1313
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:28,189
Well, you'll be outside from now on.

1314
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,117
Your name is Bruce.

1315
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:55,349
My name is Bruce.

1316
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,592
We're gonna try you on farming
for a period, Bruce.

1317
01:25:59,759 --> 01:26:03,389
- Okay.
- Staff thought you'd be better off.

1318
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:05,708
I think you'll like it here.

1319
01:26:05,878 --> 01:26:08,073
I think I'll like it here.

1320
01:26:09,118 --> 01:26:11,757
Come on, I'll show you
where you're gonna be sleeping.

1321
01:26:12,759 --> 01:26:14,829
You like mountains, Bruce?

1322
01:26:14,998 --> 01:26:16,194
Look up.

1323
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:17,917
Mountains.

1324
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:20,832
No snow, but mountains.

1325
01:26:20,998 --> 01:26:22,591
I like mountains.

1326
01:26:22,759 --> 01:26:24,988
The air is good here.

1327
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,275
I like air.

1328
01:26:28,078 --> 01:26:29,273
Yeah.

1329
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,590
We all like air, Bruce. We really do.

1330
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:34,988
That we have in common.

1331
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,711
4G.

1332
01:26:39,878 --> 01:26:41,631
Yours is 4G. Can you remember that?

1333
01:26:41,798 --> 01:26:43,390
4G.

1334
01:26:45,519 --> 01:26:47,237
Will I be seeing my friends?

1335
01:26:47,798 --> 01:26:50,108
What, you mean
from back where you were?

1336
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:51,917
The Santa Ana facility?

1337
01:26:53,238 --> 01:26:54,592
Mike and Laura...

1338
01:26:54,759 --> 01:26:58,149
...and Mike and Eddie. And...

1339
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:00,514
The people from
the residence facilities...

1340
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:02,954
...they don't come out
to the farms, Bruce.

1341
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:06,429
- See, these are closed operations.
- Closed operations.

1342
01:27:06,599 --> 01:27:09,556
But, you know,
you might get back up there...

1343
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:11,231
...couple times a year.

1344
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:13,868
You know,
there are gatherings at Christmas...

1345
01:27:14,038 --> 01:27:15,676
...and the next one is Thanksgiving.

1346
01:27:15,838 --> 01:27:16,988
Thanksgiving.

1347
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:20,230
So you might see them in three months.

1348
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:34,996
Hey, Audrey.

1349
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,155
Glad you could meet.

1350
01:27:38,038 --> 01:27:40,952
So tell me, are they
getting paranoid about him?

1351
01:27:41,118 --> 01:27:43,587
No, not at all. The guy's so burnt-out.

1352
01:27:45,319 --> 01:27:47,880
And we're still convinced
they're growing the stuff?

1353
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:50,872
They have to be. Who else?

1354
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:55,077
I just wonder
if it even matters at this...

1355
01:27:55,238 --> 01:27:58,390
It matters, Audrey.

1356
01:27:58,559 --> 01:28:01,471
It matters when we can prove
that New Path is the one growing...

1357
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:03,391
...manufacturing and distributing.

1358
01:28:04,838 --> 01:28:06,751
How does he look?

1359
01:28:07,519 --> 01:28:10,591
I mean, do you think he's gonna
be able to pull through for us?

1360
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,353
All we can do is hope
that when he finally gets in there...

1361
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:18,114
...a few charred brain cells will flicker on
and some distant instinct will kick in.

1362
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:19,712
It's just...

1363
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,833
- It's just such a cost to pay.
- Yeah.

1364
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,270
But there's no other way to get in there.

1365
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:29,318
I couldn't, and think how long I tried.

1366
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,270
They got that place locked up tight.

1367
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,555
They're only gonna let a burnt-out husk
like Bruce in.

1368
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,074
Harmless. You have to be,
or they won't take the risk.

1369
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,958
Yeah, but to sacrifice someone...

1370
01:28:41,118 --> 01:28:44,157
...a living person,
without them ever knowing it.

1371
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,435
I mean, if he'd understood,
if he had volunteered...

1372
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,430
...but he doesn't know and he never did.

1373
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,670
He didn't volunteer for this.

1374
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,273
Sure he did. It was his job.

1375
01:28:54,439 --> 01:28:56,715
It wasn't his job to get addicted.

1376
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,271
We took care of that.

1377
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:01,475
Look, Mike, I gotta get out.

1378
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:03,835
I can't do this again.

1379
01:29:03,998 --> 01:29:06,796
I want it to end. I...

1380
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,554
I lay in bed at night, and I can't sleep,
and I just think:

1381
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:13,314
- "Shit, we are colder than they are".
- I don't think so.

1382
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:16,278
I mean, I believe God's m. o.
is to transmute evil into good...

1383
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:19,078
...and if he's active here,
he's doing that now...

1384
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:21,470
...although our eyes can't perceive it.

1385
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,711
The whole process is hidden
beneath the surface of our reality...

1386
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,346
...will only be revealed later.

1387
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,637
And even then...

1388
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,916
...the people of the future...

1389
01:29:32,078 --> 01:29:35,515
...our children's children
will never truly know...

1390
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,274
...this awful time that we have
gone through and the losses we took.

1391
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,997
Well, maybe some footnote
in a minor history book.

1392
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,707
A brief mention
with no list of the fallen.

1393
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:34,430
You're seeing the flower of the future.

1394
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:38,190
- But not for you, Bruce.
- Not for me.

1395
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:40,868
No, you've had too much
of a good thing already.

1396
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:44,957
Get up, get up. Stop worshipping.

1397
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:47,792
This isn't your god anymore,
although it once was.

1398
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:50,319
Gone.

1399
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:53,036
Flowers gone.

1400
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,077
No, you just can't see them.

1401
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:56,912
Back to work.

1402
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,313
I saw.

1403
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:04,667
Back to work, Bruce.

1404
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,791
I saw death rising from the earth...

1405
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:15,755
...from the ground itself...

1406
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:21,756
...in one blue field.

1407
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:29,278
A present for my friends...

1408
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,836
...at Thanksgiving.
