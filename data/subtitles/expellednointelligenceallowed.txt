00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.</i>

3
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,700
<i>Today it is my distinct pleasure</i>

4
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,300
<i>to introduce a man
who is recognized--</i>

5
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,300
The battle over evolution
is only one skirmish

6
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,900
in a much larger war.

7
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,400
Science simply makes no use
of the hypothesis of God.

8
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,000
Ask yourself, what has
Intelligent Design given us?
Nothing.

9
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,700
We cannot accept Intelligent Design

10
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,000
as an alternative scientific theory.

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,500
They will never accept
that we have a better argument.

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,300
they just pester us,
and they waste our time.

13
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,200
<i>...variety of topics, ranging from
economics, civil rights,</i>

14
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,500
<i>to how not to ruin your life
in ten easy steps.</i>

15
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,200
Today, Ben is speaking
on the topic

16
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,800
that has become increasingly important
to him over recent years.

17
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,200
While Ben has always been
an ardent supporter of science,

18
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,600
lately he has noticed
an alarming trend

19
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,300
in the scientific establishment

20
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,400
that could have dire consequences

21
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,500
for every American.

22
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
Without further ado,

23
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
please join me in giving a warm welcome

24
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
for Mr. Ben Stein.

25
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
Thank you.

26
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,500
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very much.
Thank you.

27
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Thank you very much,
everybody.

28
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,200
Thank you very much,
gangstas.

29
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Thank you very, very much.

30
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,000
Freedom is the essence of America.

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We're talking about freedom of speech,

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Freedom of assembly,

33
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,900
Freedom from fear,
freedom of religion.

34
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,200
Martin Luther King said,

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,900
"America is essentially a dream,"

36
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,300
and he said it is a dream
of freedom and equality.

37
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,700
Freedom is the way to equality.

38
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
And America simply would
not be America without freedom.

39
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,100
In every turning point
in our history,

40
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,900
the decision has always
been about freedom.

41
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
<i>freedom is what makes
this country great.</i>

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,200
<i>Freedom has allowed us
to create, to explore,</i>

43
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,200
<i>To overcome every challenge
we have faced as a nation.</i>

44
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,300
<i>But imagine if these freedoms
were taken away.</i>

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,700
<i>Where would we be?
What would we lose?</i>

46
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,600
<i>Well, unfortunately,
I no longer need to imagine.</i>

47
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,500
<i>It's happening.</i>

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>We are losing our freedom</i>

49
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,900
<i>in one of the most important
sectors of society--</i>

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,700
<i>Science.</i>

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
<i>I have always assumed</i>

52
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>that scientists were free
to ask any question,</i>

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,900
<i>to pursue any line of inquiry</i>

54
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,300
<i>without fear of reprisal,</i>

55
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,100
<i>But recently
I've been alarmed to discover</i>

56
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,900
<i>that this is not the case.</i>

57
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,200
<i>It all began when I met</i>

58
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,900
<i>evolutionary biologist
Richard Sternberg</i>

59
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
<i>in Washington, D.C.</i>

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
<i>His life was nearly ruined</i>

61
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
<i>when he strayed
from the party line</i>

62
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>while serving as editor
of a scientific journal</i>

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
<i>affiliated with the prestigious</i>

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,300
<i>Smithsonian Museum
of Natural History.</i>

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,000
Your office was over there?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's correct.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
This here is the west wing.

68
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Directly ahead of us
is the west wing

69
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
of the Natural History Museum.

70
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,500
So now you're not there anymore

71
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,800
Because you were a bad boy.

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
No, I'm not.
No, I was exiled.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,900
You were a bad boy.

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,000
You questioned the powers that be.

75
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,600
<i>What was dr. Sternberg's crime?</i>

76
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,900
<i>He dared to publish an article
by dr. Stephen Meyer,</i>

77
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
<i>one of the leading lights</i>

78
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,500
<i>of the Intelligent Design
movement.</i>

79
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,400
<i>The paper ignited
a firestorm of controversy</i>

80
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,100
<i>merely because it suggested
Intelligent Design</i>

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,300
<i>might be able to explain
how life began.</i>

82
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>As a result, Dr. Sternberg
lost his office,</i>

83
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,700
<i>his political
and religious beliefs
were investigated,</i>

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,200
<i>and he was pressured
to resign.</i>

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,700
The questioning of darwinism

86
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
was a bridge too far for many.

87
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
The mentioning of
Intelligent Design

88
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,200
that occurs at the end of the paper
was over the top.

89
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,800
And I think the
Intelligent Design proponents

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
have raised a number of
very important questions.

91
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
And you wanted to get
those questions

92
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
brought up and discussed.

93
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,000
- Placed on the table.
- Placed on the table.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,300
People were so upset about it.

95
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
They were so upset
that you could see their ---

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
They had a physical
emotional reaction.

97
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,900
Wow.

98
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,200
They were saying

99
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,500
that Stephen C. Meyer
is a well-known christian,

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,600
that Stephen C. Meyer is
an Intelligent Design proponent,

101
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,000
that Stephen C. Meyer
is a republican.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,700
It was all couched in terms of

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
religion, politics,
and sociology.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,200
The way the Chair of the
Department put it

105
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,700
is that I was viewed
as an intellectual terrorist.

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,700
Terrorist?

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Because of giving the topic

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,900
of Intelligent Design some
modicum of credibility.

109
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,500
<i>What happened to Dr. Sternberg
was terrible,</i>

110
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>but surely it was
just an isolated case.</i>

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>I was still pretty skeptical,</i>

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,600
<i>so naturally
I checked in with the head</i>

113
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
<i>of the Skeptics Society,
Michael Shermer.</i>

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,400
So I can't prove there is no god,

115
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Or Yahweh in your case,

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,300
any more than I can prove
there is no Isis, Zeus,

117
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,600
Apollo, Brahma, Ganesha,
Mithra, Allah,

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,100
Or for that matter,
the flying spaghetti monster.

119
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
And think about just
one thing:

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Why would the aliens
look like this?

121
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,100
- These are bipedal--
- Who drew that?

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,500
Skepticism...
It's not a position you take.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
It's just an approach to claims.

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>This one's called
the borderlands of Science:
where sense meets nonsense.</i>

125
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,500
Is Intelligent Design nonsense?

126
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Well, it's unproven,

127
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
So in that sense it's nonsense.

128
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,700
So I would put it
in the sort of shaded areas

129
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,500
Between good, solid science
and total nonsense.

130
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,300
You know, it's sort of
three quarters of the way
toward the nonsense side.

131
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
But you think,
nevertheless,

132
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,000
people should be allowed
to speak about

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
and publish papers about it.

134
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,700
They are free to write
and publish and be heard

135
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
in public forums
and go to conferences

136
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,900
just like everybody else does.

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,100
What if a person published something,
say, at the Smithsonian

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,800
in favor of Intelligent Design
and lost his job over it?

139
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,400
I mean, it had been
peer-reviewed and published

140
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
and then he lost his job
over it anyway.

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,900
What about that situation?

142
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Well...I think
that particular situation,

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
there was something else
going on.

144
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,800
- What was going on?
- I don't know.

145
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,700
I mean, I don't know
because I don't know,

146
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,000
but I think there had
to be something.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
People don't get fired
over something like that.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
You roll up your sleeves,
you get to work,

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
You do the research,
you get your grants,

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,900
you get your data,
you publish,

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,200
and you work your butt off,

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
and that's how you get
your theories taught--

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
What if you try and try
and roll up your sleeves

154
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,900
and go to work
and work your butt off,

155
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,800
and they say,
"we're going to fire you

156
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
if you even mention the word
Intelligent Design"?

157
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
I don't think that's happened.
Where is that happening?

158
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
<i>George Mason University--</i>

159
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,600
<i>Throughout its 50-year history,</i>

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,900
<i>our mission has remained clear--</i>

164
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>After dr. Caroline
Crocker simply mentioned</i>

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,400
<i>Intelligent Design
in her cell biology class</i>

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
<i>at George Mason University,</i>

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,400
<i>her promising academic career
came to an abrupt end.</i>

168
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
My supervisor invited me
into his office.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,900
He said,
"I'm going to have to discipline you

170
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
for teaching creationism."

171
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
and I said,
"I mentioned Intelligent Design

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,100
on a couple of slides,

173
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,400
but I did not teach creationism."

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,400
He said, "nonetheless,
you have to be disciplined."

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
At the end of the semester,
I lost my job.

176
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,100
<i>Not only did this
well-loved professor</i>

177
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
<i>lose her job at George Mason,</i>

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
<i>she suddenly found herself
blacklisted,</i>

179
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
<i>unable to find
a job anywhere.</i>

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,100
So whenever I interviewed for a job,

181
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,300
I would be offered it
usually on the spot.

182
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Since this has happened,

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,300
and since people can Google my name,

184
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm finding that,
when I send my credentials,

185
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,000
I do get interviews--
I get many interviews--

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,700
but I never get offered a job.

187
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,600
I don't tell them about my--

188
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
about my, uh, "science sin."

189
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,700
I was only trying to teach
what the University stands for,

190
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,100
which is academic freedom.

191
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>There's nothing
to be learned in neurosurgery</i>

192
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,100
<i>by assuming
an accidental origin</i>

193
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,700
<i>for the parts of the brain
that we work on.</i>

194
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,700
<i>It wasn't just biologists</i>

195
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,200
<i>who were feeling
the darwinist wrath.</i>

196
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>When neurosurgeon Michael Egnor</i>

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
<i>wrote an essay
to high school students</i>

198
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,200
<i>saying doctors didn't need
to study evolution</i>

199
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
<i>in order to practice medicine,</i>

200
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,700
<i>the darwinists were quick</i>

201
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>to try and exterminate
this new threat.</i>

202
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,200
A lot of people in a lot of blogs

203
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,800
called me unprintable names
that were printed.

204
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,000
There were a lot of very,
very nasty comments.

205
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,300
Other people suggested

206
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
that people call
the university I work at,

207
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,500
and suggest that perhaps
it's time for me to retire.

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,100
I realized when I kind of
went public

209
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,300
with my doubts about the adequacy
of Darwin's theory,

210
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,000
You know, that I would
encounter criticism.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,700
What has amazed me is
the viciousness

212
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,500
and the sort of baseness of it.

213
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm an old guy.
I have tenure.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm academically safe.

215
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
But the young people

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
and what is happening to them
in America right now

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
because of this scientism gulag

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,100
is really terrible.

219
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,900
<i>Apparently Professor Marks</i>

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,900
<i>was not as safe
as he thought.</i>

221
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,200
<i>A few months
after this interview,</i>

222
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,400
<i>Baylor University shut down
his research web site</i>

223
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,900
<i>and forced him
to return grant money</i>

224
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,400
<i>once they discovered a link</i>

225
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,100
<i>between his work
and Intelligent Design.</i>

226
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,400
In order to attract grants,
you have to market yourself.

227
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,800
So you put up sites
and call yourself

228
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
"labs" and "groups"
and things like that

229
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,500
In order to get visibility.

230
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,100
And in my entire
experience in Academia

231
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
I never went to any superior

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
and asked them any permission

233
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,200
to put up any of these labs.

234
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,700
So the fact that
this was singled out,

235
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,500
let alone shut down,
is jaw-dropping.
It's astonishing.

236
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,600
I have never been treated
like this in my--

237
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
about 30 years in Academia.

238
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Shut up, you freak!
I said shut up!

239
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,600
It's a madhouse!

240
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
If you peel back the onion,

241
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
I think that there's no doubt

242
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,800
that the center of this is my work

243
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
in what some would call
Intelligent Design.

244
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,300
People really get
emotional about this.

245
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,000
Whenever you say "Intelligent Design"
in a room of academics,

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,900
them's fighting words.

247
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,000
Creationists!

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,700
<i>Astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez</i>

249
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
<i>found himself
in a fierce shootout</i>

250
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>with Iowa State University,</i>

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
<i>following the publication
of his book</i>

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>arguing that the universe
is Intelligently Designed.</i>

253
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,100
<i>despite a stellar
research record</i>

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>that has led
to the discovery
of several planets,</i>

255
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,900
<i>his application
for tenure was denied,</i>

256
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
<i>putting his career
in jeopardy.</i>

257
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,300
I worried about my tenure
a little bit in 2005

258
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,400
When the petition
was being circulated

259
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
because I viewed
that as a strategy

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,200
of Hector Avalos and his associates

261
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,900
to try to poison
the atmosphere on campus against me.

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
Because he knew
I wasn't tenured yet,

263
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,500
and I was very vulnerable.

264
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,600
I have little doubt that
I would have tenure now

265
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,800
if I hadn't done
any professional work
on Intelligent Design.

266
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,000
<i>Dr. Gonzalez had
this advice for scientists</i>

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>who might be thinking
about following his example.</i>

268
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
If they value their careers...

269
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,100
they should keep quiet

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
about their
Intelligent Design views.

271
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,000
We know there are times and
places to be quiet,

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
and other times and places

273
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,800
when we can make noise
if we want to.

274
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
<i>- Will you show us?
- Of course.</i>

275
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
Boys and girls,

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
How would you like to show

277
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Some of the ways we know
of being quiet?

278
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,900
It's the kind of thing
where you just learn
to keep your mouth shut.

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
<i>In addition
to those scientists</i>

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
<i>who were willing
to appear on camera,</i>

281
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
<i>we encountered many more
who didn't dare show their face</i>

282
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,100
<i>for fear of losing their jobs.</i>

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,300
You use an
Intelligent Design perspective

284
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,100
to get the research done,

285
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,800
but you're not allowed
to talk about it in public.

286
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,900
And so there is
definitely incentive,
if you think about it,

287
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,000
for people to remain
within the mainstream.

288
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
You know,
"what's he up to?

289
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,400
What is he thinking?
Is he one of them?"
that kind of thing.

290
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,300
If I write
"Intelligent Design",

291
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,000
they hear "creationism",

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
they hear "religious right",
they hear "theocracy."

293
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>So it appears Mr. Shermer,
the self-styled skeptic,</i>

294
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,600
<i>was wrong on this one.</i>

295
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
<i>Intelligent Design
was being suppressed</i>

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,700
<i>in a systematic
and ruthless fashion.</i>

297
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>But maybe Intelligent Design
should be suppressed.</i>

298
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>I didn't like
what was happening to
these scientists,</i>

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,100
<i>but on the other hand,</i>

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
<i>we don't want our kids
being taught</i>

301
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
<i>that the Earth is flat</i>

302
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,100
<i>or the the Holocaust
never happened.</i>

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>It was time to ask
the scientific establishment</i>

304
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,700
<i>what was so bad about
Intelligent Design.</i>

305
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Intelligent Design people
are not genuine scientists.

306
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,100
Intelligent Design is a racket.

307
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,000
It's just propaganda.

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
The only Intelligent thing about it

309
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
is to have got people to call it that.

310
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,400
It's really very stupid, as well.

311
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,500
Everybody knows science education

312
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,100
in America is appalling.

313
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
What we don't need at this time

314
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,300
is Intelligent Design
in the classrooms.

315
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,600
To present Intelligent Design

316
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
stunts their educational growth.

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
It stunts their intellectual growth.

318
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,800
But what I don't understand

319
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,500
is how these animals
could have been on Earth

320
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
millions of years before man

321
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,500
when the Bible says
the whole Earth was created
in only six days.

322
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,100
<i>It wasn't just the
educational aspects of
Intelligent Design</i>

323
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,000
<i>that had scientists
concerned.</i>

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,900
<i>Many suspected the movement
masked a much larger agenda.</i>

325
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,300
Intelligent Design is
a set of excuses

326
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,700
to squeeze creationism
into the classrooms.

327
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Get Intelligent Design
in the schools today,

328
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,100
and we can have
school prayers tomorrow.

329
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,300
<i>Any other complaints?</i>

330
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,100
Can you imagine
anything more boring?

331
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,800
The boredom attached to I.D.
is supreme.

332
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,300
It is so boring

333
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,700
that I can't even bother
to think about it
much any more.

334
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,100
It's just utterly boring.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,900
<i>Love was in the air, all right,</i>

336
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,500
<i>But none of it was directed
toward Intelligent Design.</i>

337
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
<i>There seemed to be
a lot to hate about I.D.,</i>

338
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,600
<i>and nearly all of that hatred
was focused on one place.</i>

339
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,900
The people in the--
from the Discovery Institute--

340
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,200
The people who are doing
the Intelligent Design--

341
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,500
they're all varnish
and no product.

342
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
The Discovery Institute
is a propaganda mill.

343
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
It's a --
it's an institution

344
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,400
designed to suck in money
from religious investors

345
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,900
and turn it into a sanitized,
somewhat secular version

346
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
of the creation story
to get it into the schools.

347
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,100
If they have a way
of understanding nature

348
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,800
that's superior
to the one that we all

349
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
are making lots of
discoveries using, great.

350
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,500
- Bring it on.

351
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
We are really, really lost.

352
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,100
I think it's on third.

353
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,700
I think it's on third.
I think it's down there.

354
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,400
I have no idea where this place is.

355
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,900
I guess I just keep walking.

356
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,600
Do you have any idea where
the Discovery Institute is?

357
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,900
Have you ever heard of that?

358
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,200
- Never heard of it.
- Okay, thank you.

359
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,100
- Hey, Ben.
- How are you, sir?

360
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
- I'm good. Yourself?
- Good.

361
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,700
Do you have any idea where
the Discovery Institute is?

362
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
- Not a clue.
- Discovery Institute?

363
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
- Thank you, it's very kind
of you to offer--
- Welcome to Seattle.

364
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,000
Thank you, sir.

365
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
It's gotta be this whole building.

366
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,100
Yes, where is the
Discovery Institute, please?

367
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
Discovery Institute--
on the eighth floor,
suite 808.

368
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Okay, very good.

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,300
Aha, success at last.

370
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Aha, we found you.

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
Are you Bruce Chapman?

372
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
- I am.
- How are you? I'm Ben Stein.

373
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
- Welcome.
- Kind of you to have me here.

374
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,300
Delighted to meet you.

375
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,700
Can I look around
and see your offices?

376
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,300
Absolutely.

377
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,100
Do you just have this floor,

378
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,200
or do you have several
other floors as well?

379
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,300
- No, this is it.
- This is it?

380
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,800
You've made an awful lot of trouble

381
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
For being such a small office.

382
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,300
I thought it was going
to be like the Pentagon.

383
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,400
We're like the little boy
that said the emperor has no clothes.

384
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,100
And he didn't have
a big organization either.

385
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,300
When you go around
and raise funds,

386
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,600
your people are not saying to them,

387
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
"by the way,
we're going to get

388
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,700
all these scientists
out of the classroom

389
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,800
and put Christ back
in the classroom?"

390
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,700
Well, I don't know that Christ

391
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
has ever been in the
science classroom.

392
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,400
This is not a religious argument.

393
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
This is something that people--

394
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,900
We have fellows who are jewish
or agnostic

395
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
or various other things.

396
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,100
There are -- there are
muslim scientists,

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,100
there are people of
all kinds of backgrounds

398
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,900
who agree that Darwin's theory
has failed.

399
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,800
So why would you bring
religion into it?

400
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
You don't need religion.
This is a red herring, Ben.

401
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,600
People who don't have
an argument

402
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,400
are reduced to throwing
sand in your eyes.

403
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,900
If the Discovery Institute

404
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,400
could get its wish
about this subject,

405
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
What would your wish be?

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
Well, on this subject,
as on others,

407
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,000
we'd like people
to be able to have

408
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
a robust dialogue
and even a debate

409
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Where the best evidence ---

410
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,000
in this case the best
scientific evidence ---

411
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,900
is made available to people.

412
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,500
Surely no one questions
there should be a debate.

413
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, yes, they do.

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,900
- They do?
- They say the debate
has been settled,

415
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,700
- That the issue's settled.
- When was the debate settled?

416
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,400
Ben, I'd like you to talk
to the scientists.

417
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,300
You don't want to get
your science from me.

418
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
<i>Mr. Chapman claimed I.D. had
nothing to do with religion,</i>

419
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,100
<i>So why was my first stop
Biola University,</i>

420
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,500
<i>formerly known
as the Bible Institute
of Los Angeles?</i>

421
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,500
String theory will be a footnote
in the history of science.

422
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,400
The inference that Stonehenge
was caused by intelligence...

423
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,600
How much money have you
ever gotten from Jerry Falwell?

424
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,200
Uh, zero dollars.

425
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,500
How about Pat Robertson?

426
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,800
Zero.

427
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Are you a minister?

428
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,800
No.

429
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,500
- Are you a priest?
- No.

430
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,600
- Pastor?
- No.

431
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,100
- Youth pastor?
- No.

432
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,700
I did teach Sunday school once.

433
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,400
Hasn't this all been resolved?

434
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,200
Aren't we all darwinists now,

435
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,700
except for a few cranks like you?

436
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,500
Well, it's a funny thing
that questions

437
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,400
that aren't properly answered
don't go away.

438
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,500
This question is loaded with
all kinds of political baggage,

439
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
but one-on-one at a
scientific meeting,

440
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,300
after the third or fourth beer,

441
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,100
my experience has been

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,700
that many evolutionary biologists

443
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,300
will say, "yeah, this theory
has got a lot of problems."

444
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
So you mean to tell me

445
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,200
That there really is
a debate among scientists

446
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,700
about whether or not
evolution occurred?

447
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,800
Well, "evolution"
is a kind of funny word.

448
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,000
It depends on how one defines it.

449
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,400
If it means simply
change over time,

450
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,600
even the most rock-ribbed
fundamentalist

451
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,200
knows that the history
of the Earth has changed--

452
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,400
that there's been
change over time.

453
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,500
If you define evolution
precisely, though,

454
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,300
to mean the common descent
of all life on Earth

455
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
from a single ancestor

456
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,900
via undirected mutation
and natural selection ---

457
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
--- that's textbook definition
of neo-darwinism ---

458
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,900
biologists of the first rank
have real questions.

459
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but the modern theory
of Intelligent Design

460
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,000
is just microwaved creationism.

461
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,900
I don't think that's the case.

462
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Creationism, properly understood,

463
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,600
begins with the Bible and says,

464
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,800
"how can I fit the Bible
into the data of science?"

465
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Intelligent Design
doesn't do that.

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
Intelligent Design is the study
of patterns in nature

467
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,900
that are best explained
as a result of intelligence.

468
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
So Intelligent Designers
believe that God is the designer.

469
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,700
Not necessarily.

470
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,100
Intelligent Design
is a minimal commitment,

471
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,200
scientifically,
to the possibility

472
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,800
of detecting intelligent causation.

473
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,000
<i>Dr. Nelson didn't
sound like a crazy person,</i>

474
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>But I still suspected
I.D. was nothing but
reheated creationism.</i>

475
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
<i>My next stop didn't seem like</i>

476
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
<i>it was going to alleviate
those fears.</i>

477
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Evolution is a... from an
Intelligent Design perspective,

478
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,700
is perfectly acceptable
if the sense is that

479
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
"how did the design
get implemented?"

480
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,100
The issue is, is there
a real design there

481
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,400
and are these material mechanisms,

482
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,900
like natural selection,

483
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,300
are these adequate to account
for everything we see in Biology?

484
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
And our argument is no,
it's not.

485
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
But Darwin produced
all this evidence

486
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,900
From his travels and his studies
at the Galapagos

487
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,600
that evolution explained things.

488
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,300
If you look at the
history of science,

489
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,900
People often have a good idea,

490
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
and then they decide
just to run with it.

491
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,700
And they say, "we're going
to apply this everywhere."

492
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,600
So Darwin takes his idea
of natural selection

493
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,800
And says, "I'm going to explain
all of life with it".

494
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Physics used to be
Newtonian physics.

495
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,300
<i>Newton was physics.</i>

496
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,900
And then you gotta look to
Einstein, general relativity.

497
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,400
It's not Newton is enough.

498
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
I think, likewise,
what we're finding with Darwin

499
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
is that he had some valid insights,

500
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
but it's not the whole picture.

501
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,900
<i>Okay, darwinism may not be
the complete picture,</i>

502
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,700
<i>But what made these guys think</i>

503
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,600
<i>they had the missing pieces?</i>

504
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,800
<i>I put this question
to dr. Stephen Meyer,</i>

505
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,000
<i>author of the paper
that originally got</i>

506
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,100
<i>Dr. Sternberg
in so much trouble.</i>

507
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,500
It's hard to believe
that this little town

508
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,400
is the headquarters
of giant Microsoft,

509
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,900
ihich enabled Mr. Gates
to become fantastically rich.

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,500
Maybe that's what Steve Meyer
is doing here.

511
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Maybe this is somehow
going to make him
fantastically rich.

512
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
We'll pin him down

513
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,300
like a butterfly
on a butterfly board ---

514
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,700
A butterfly on a killing board.

515
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
Coffee shop straight ahead.

516
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,100
Newton is buried
in the genius's corner

517
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,900
at Westminster Abbey, right?

518
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,500
That's correct, yeah.

519
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,900
Darwin is also buried in
Westminster Abbey.

520
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,200
Right. And so is Darwin.

521
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
- Right, right.
- Right near each other.

522
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
And you're here in Redmond,

523
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,300
in a little building
without a sign, right?

524
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,100
And you're obviously
an incredibly smart guy,

525
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,700
but how dare you challenge

526
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,500
someone who's buried
in the genius's corner

527
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,000
next to Newton at
Westminster Abbey.

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
Well, it may seem
a little cheeky,

529
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
but it's what scientists
are supposed to do.

530
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,800
When I was in Cambridge,

531
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,500
one of my supervisors
often advised us

532
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,800
to beware the sound
of one hand clapping,

533
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,900
which was a way of saying
if there's an argument
on one side,

534
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,000
there's bound to be
an argument on the other.

535
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,300
What I found in studying
the structure

536
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,700
<i>of the argument
in The Origin of Species</i>

537
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
is that for every
evidence-based argument

538
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,100
for one of Darwin's
two key propositions,

539
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,900
there is an evidence-based
counterargument.

540
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,500
Well, but --- is it a debate?

541
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,600
There's just you and
a couple of other guys

542
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,100
in a dinky little office
downtown, say, on one side,

543
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,900
and there's the faculties of all,

544
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,200
the great universities
in the world, on the other side.

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
Speaking with a great, uniform,
and authoritative voice.

546
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,500
Yes, right.

547
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, in any case, the debate

548
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,100
really isn't going to be
settled by numbers.

549
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
It's going to be settled by
the evidence and the arguments.

550
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
<i>While I was still
in Bill Gates country,</i>

551
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
<i>Dr. Meyer recommended I check in</i>

552
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,500
<i>with molecular biologist
Jonathan Wells.</i>

553
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,700
What kind of names do they call you?

554
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,300
- Uh, creationist.
- What do you say back to them

555
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,400
when they say you're a
creationist?

556
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,900
Well, I usually don't get
the opportunity.

557
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,800
What's at stake for you,
personally?

558
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,300
First of all, I love science.

559
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
I think the way Darwinism

560
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
corrupts the evidence,
distorts the evidence,

561
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
is bad for science.

562
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,600
Well, the other scientists
will tell you ---

563
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,900
to just shut up
if you love science, okay?

564
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,800
Because you're sort of being
a bomb thrower into science.

565
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
I am upsetting the applecart.

566
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,300
I think it deserves
to be upset in this case.

567
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Why?

568
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,400
Because the evidence
is being distorted

569
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
to prop up a theory that
I think doesn't fit it.

570
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,200
<i>Was Darwinism really that bad?</i>

571
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
<i>Perhaps a change of scenery</i>

572
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,100
<i>would give me a fresh perspective.</i>

573
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Mr. Berlinski, I assume?

574
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,700
- Ben Stein, what a pleasure to meet you.
- How are you, sir?

575
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,200
So, where are you from originally?

576
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,400
I was born in New York,
spent 31 years in Manhattan.

577
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,800
- Yes.
- And I spent a lot of time
in California, too.

578
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,400
And tell me all the various
universities where you've
studied or taught.

579
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,600
I was at Princeton, then I had
a professorship at Stanford.

580
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,000
then I left Stanford,
and I taught at Rutgers.

581
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
I left Rutgers, and I taught

582
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
at the City College in New York.

583
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,400
I left the City College of
New York.

584
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,900
I taught at the Baruch College,
I taught at San Jose ---

585
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,600
What did you teach at Baruch College?

586
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,100
Anything they wanted.
Come on in.

587
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,400
<i>Thank you, Monsieur.</i>

588
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,700
What an old building! Wow.

589
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,100
It's the oldest in Paris.

590
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,700
You're kidding.

591
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
<i>Merci, Monsieur.</i>

592
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,700
<i>- Ah, je vous entre.
- Merci.</i>

593
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Wow, this is fabulous.

594
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Let's put it this way.

595
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,100
Before you can ask
"is darwinian theory correct or not",

596
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
you have to ask
the preliminary question

597
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
<i>"is it clear enough
so that it could be correct?"</i>

598
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
That's a very different question.

599
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,400
One of my prevailing doctrines
about darwinian theory

600
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
is, "man, that thing
is just a mess".

601
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,900
It's like looking into
a room full of smoke.

602
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Nothing in the theory

603
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,100
is precisely, clearly,
carefully defined or delineated.

604
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
It lacks all of the rigor

605
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,400
one expects from
Mathematical Physics,

606
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
and Mathematical Physics
lacks all the rigor

607
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
one expects from Mathematics.

608
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,800
So we're talking about
a gradual descent

609
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,500
down the level of intelligibility

610
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
until we reach evolutionary biology.

611
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,700
We don't even know
what a species is,
for Heaven's sakes.

612
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,000
So his theory is smoke,
but elegant smoke.

613
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,100
There's a certain elegance to it,

614
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,100
but I think Einstein had
the appropriate remark:

615
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,300
he preferred to leave
elegance to his tailor.

616
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
<i>A room full of smoke?</i>

617
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,900
<i>That certainly wasn't
what I was hearing</i>

618
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>from prominent darwinists
like Richard Dawkins.</i>

619
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,100
Evolution is a fact.

620
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's a fact which is
established as securely

621
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,500
as essentially any other fact
that we have in science.

622
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,700
<i>Richard Dawkins
is so confident</i>

623
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,100
<i>that evolution is a fact</i>

624
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,500
<i>and that therefore
God doesn't exist</i>

625
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,600
<i>that he has devoted
his entire life</i>

626
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
<i>to spreading
the evolution gospel.</i>

627
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm an atheist with respect
to the judeo-christian god,

628
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,100
because there is not
a shred of evidence

629
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,200
in favor of the judeo-christian god.

630
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,600
It is completely right to say

631
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,300
that since the evidence
for evolution

632
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,800
is so absolutely,
totally overwhelming ---

633
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,400
nobody who looks at it
could possibly doubt that

634
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,300
if they were sane
and not stupid ---

635
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,100
so the only remaining
possibility is that they're ignorant,

636
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,600
and most people who
don't believe in evolution
are indeed ignorant.

637
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,200
<i>But the people I spoke with
weren't ignorant.</i>

638
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,800
<i>They were
highly credentialed scientists.</i>

639
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,000
<i>So there had to be
something else going on here.</i>

640
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,600
So you think the whole theory
of evolution is false

641
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,300
or just certain parts of it?

642
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,800
Well, again, "evolution"
is a slippery word.

643
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,700
I would say minor changes
within species happen.

644
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
But Darwin didn't write
a book called

645
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,300
<i>"How existing species
change over time".</i>

646
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,500
<i>He wrote a book called
The Origin of Species.</i>

647
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,100
- He purported to show
how this same process ---
- Huh, I see.

648
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,800
... leads to new species ---
in fact, every species ---

649
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,200
and the evidence for that grand claim

650
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,700
is, in my opinion,
almost totally lacking.

651
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,300
How does Darwin ---
or darwinism ---
say life began?

652
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,800
Well, he didn't know.
And, in fact, nobody knows.

653
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
So darwinism, strictly defined,

654
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,900
starts after the origin of life

655
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,000
and deals only with living things.

656
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
How can there be
a theory about life

657
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,500
without a theory about
how life began?

658
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Well, a grand, overarching
evolutionary story,

659
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
of course, does include
the origin of life.

660
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,600
Darwin's theory doesn't begin

661
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,400
until you have the first cell.

662
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
Does someone have a theory
about how life began?

663
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,500
<i>This is the story
of a small planet in space</i>

664
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,900
<i>called Earth.</i>

665
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,200
<i>For a typical
darwinian explanation</i>

666
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
<i>of how life originated,</i>

667
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,500
<i>Dr. Wells directed me
toward this documentary.</i>

668
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,900
<i>The chemical elements
essential for life ---</i>

669
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,300
<i>hydrogen, oxygen,
carbon, and nitrogen ---</i>

670
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,500
<i>were now in place.</i>

671
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,500
<i>what was needed was
a way of combining them.</i>

672
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,200
<i>Perhaps the energy
came from lightning.</i>

673
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
<i>-- whatever it was --</i>

674
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,700
<i>Excuse me?</i>

675
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,900
<i>whatever it was,</i>

676
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,200
<i>Energy managed to arrange
these chemical ingredients</i>

677
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,400
<i>in just the right way.</i>

678
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,200
<i>"whatever it was"?</i>

679
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,600
<i>I was hoping for something
a little more scientific.</i>

680
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,900
<i>The most popular idea</i>

681
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,300
<i>has been that life
emerged spontaneously</i>

682
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>from primordial soup.</i>

683
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
<i>In 1953, Stanley Miller</i>

684
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,100
<i>mixed water, methane,
ammonia, and hydrogen</i>

685
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
<i>To simulate the early
Earth's atmosphere.</i>

686
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,500
<i>Then he ran electricity
through it</i>

687
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,100
<i>in an attempt to jump-start life.</i>

688
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,500
It's alive!
It's alive!

689
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,400
It's alive!

690
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
<i>It didn't work.</i>

691
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
<i>While the initial results
seemed promising,</i>

692
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,100
<i>50 years later,
most serious scientists</i>

693
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,900
<i>have abandoned this approach</i>

694
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
<i>in favor of alternate theories.</i>

695
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,000
<i>Prominent darwinist
Michael Ruse</i>

696
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,700
<i>attempted to explain
one of them to me.</i>

697
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,600
<i>He wasn't kidding.</i>

698
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,800
How did we get from
an inorganic world

699
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,800
to the world of the cell?

700
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, one popular theory is that
it might have started off
on the backs of crystals.

701
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,700
My crystal ball.

702
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,600
Molecules piggybacked
on the back of crystals forming,

703
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,900
And that this led
to more and more complex ---

704
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,500
but of course the nice thing
about crystals

705
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,000
is that every now and then
you get mistakes --mutations--

706
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,100
and that this opens the way
for natural selection.

707
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,200
But --- but at one point
there was not a living thing,

708
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,000
and then there was a living thing.

709
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,200
How did that happen?

710
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Well, that's just a ---
I've just told you.

711
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,500
I don't see any reason why
you shouldn't go

712
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,400
from very simple to
more and more complex
to more and more complex ---

713
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I don't either.

714
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,200
But I don't know how you get
from mud

715
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
to a living cell.
That's my question.

716
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Yes, well, I've told you.
I'll try one more time.

717
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
You think it was on
the backs of crystals.

718
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,100
On the backs of crystals is
at least one hypothesis, yes.

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
So that's your theory, and you
think that is more likely

720
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
and less far-fetched
than Intelligent Design.

721
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,000
I think it is.

722
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,600
<i>I wouldn't put Ben Stein's money</i>

723
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
<i>On Dr. Ruse's joyriding crystals,</i>

724
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,300
<i>but it did make me wonder</i>

725
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,000
<i>what were the chances of life
arising on its own?</i>

726
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,200
It's been speculated that probably

727
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,500
there would have to be

728
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,900
a minimum of about 250 proteins

729
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,300
to provide minimal life function.

730
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,000
Umm, if that's really true,

731
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,500
then I think it's
almost inconceivable

732
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
that life could have happened

733
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
in some simple, step-by-step way.

734
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,800
<i>Okay, so the simplest form of life</i>

735
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,700
<i>requires at least
250 proteins to function.</i>

736
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,900
<i>What's so difficult
about that?</i>

737
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,300
<i>Welcome to the Casino Of Life.</i>

738
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,400
Who wants to spin
for a chance to win?

739
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,600
Oh, sure. I'll give it a shot.

740
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,900
What do I win?

741
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
Take a look at this.

742
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,900
- Huh?

743
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,500
How 'bout the world's
first single-cell organism?

744
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,000
This perfectly aligned
string of proteins

745
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,500
could be yours.

746
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,400
Now, take a spin.

747
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
- I won!

748
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,500
Tina, tell him how many times

749
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,200
He needs to do that
to win the prize.

750
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Two hundred and fifty.

751
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,700
That's right, folks.

752
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,400
And all in the correct order.

753
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
But that's impossible.

754
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We've heard that before,

755
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,300
haven't we, Richard?

756
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,500
Come on, Mother Nature,
do your thing.

757
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,900
You stupid machine!
I hate you.

758
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,500
We're talking about something
that's staggeringly improbable,

759
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,500
Roughly one in a trillion,
trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion.

760
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,800
Let all of life chose
a million, a trillion,

761
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,200
a trillion trillion ---

762
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,700
the number is essentially zero.

763
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,600
Something has to skew nature
to chose the ones that work.

764
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
<i>So, in the game of life,</i>

765
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,300
<i>it looks as if
the house always wins.</i>

766
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>Luckily, some serious
scientific minds</i>

767
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,300
<i>have figured out a way
to beat the odds.</i>

768
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,100
<i>When faced with
the overwhelming problem</i>

769
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
<i>of the origin of life,</i>

770
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
<i>Nobel prize-winner
Francis Crick</i>

771
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,300
<i>proposed this theory ---</i>

772
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,800
<i>that life was "seeded" on Earth,</i>

773
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,200
<i>which basically means,
aliens did it.</i>

774
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,200
<i>Crystals? Aliens?</i>

775
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,700
<i>I thought we were talking
about science,</i>

776
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,300
<i>not science-fiction.</i>

777
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,200
We don't know what
caused life to arise.

778
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,600
Did it arise by a purely
undirected process,

779
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
or did it arise by some kind

780
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,300
of intelligent guidance
or design?

781
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,100
And the rules of science

782
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
are being applied to
actually foreclose

783
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,800
one of the two possible answers

784
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,200
to that very fundamental,
and basic, and important question.

785
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
So the rules of science say

786
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,900
we will consider any possibility

787
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,500
- Except one that is guided.
- Exactly.

788
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,200
<i>No matter how life began,</i>

789
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
<i>on the backs of crystals</i>

790
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,700
<i>or in the test tube
of some Intelligent Designer,</i>

791
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,900
<i>Everyone agrees it started
with a single cell.</i>

792
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
<i>But what is a cell?</i>

793
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,200
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

794
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,000
<i>Darwin wrote "The Origin Of
Species" in 1859 ---</i>

795
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Published it in 1859.

796
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,000
He had an idea of the cell
as being quite simple, correct?

797
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Yeah, everybody did.

798
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,700
Okay, if he thought of
the cell as being a Buick,

799
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,100
what is the cell now

800
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
In terms of its complexity
by comparison?

801
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,400
A galaxy.

802
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,400
If Darwin thought a cell

803
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,500
was, say, a mud hut,

804
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,200
what do we now know that a cell is?

805
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,000
More complicated than a Saturn V.

806
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,100
So what is in a cell,
as far as we know now?

807
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,200
A world that Darwin
never could have imagined.

808
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,700
<i>I needed someone who could</i>

809
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,200
<i>give me a glimpse
into this world,</i>

810
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,000
<i>So we went to molecular
biologist Doug Axe.</i>

811
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Think of a cell
as being a nanofactory,

812
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,400
a factory where,
on a very-small scale,

813
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
digital instructions
are being used

814
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,800
to make the components
of the factory.

815
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,700
Here we have the famous
D.N.A. double helix.

816
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
You can see the two helical strands

817
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,400
that are intertwined and
wind around each other

818
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
on the outside of the molecule.

819
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,600
This is the material that stores

820
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,900
all of our genetic information.

821
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
In higher life forms,
this would be the equivalent

822
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,400
of something like a gigabyte
of information,

823
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,100
stored in the molecules

824
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,300
that form the individual
chromosomes,

825
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,400
all packed within the nucleus,

826
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,800
which is a tiny fraction
of the entire cell size.

827
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
So what does DNA do?

828
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,800
Well, the information in DNA

829
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
ends up providing the information

830
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,500
for sequencing the aminoacids
to make protein.

831
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,400
We have information
in a one-dimensional form

832
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,800
that provides the information
for a three-dimensional form.

833
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,550
<i>I'm finally just beginning to grasp</i>

834
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,250
<i>the complexity of the cell.</i>

835
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,050
<i>Are there systems within the cell</i>

836
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,750
<i>that go well beyond
darwinian evolution,</i>

837
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,050
<i>some type of cellular technology</i>

838
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,750
<i>that drives adaptation, replication,</i>

839
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,150
<i>quality control, and repair?</i>

840
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,750
<i>What if these new mechanisms</i>

841
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,350
<i>have massive design implications?</i>

842
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,850
<i>Well, I say so be it.</i>

843
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,650
The cell really is like
nothing we've ever seen
in the physical world.

844
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,250
That's got to be firmly grasped.

845
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,050
That's not something we can just say,

846
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,450
"oh, well, it's just a little
bit more of the same old, same old".

847
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,350
It's not the same old, same old.

848
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,150
What we are finding
is that there's information

849
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,750
that's in the cell
that cannot be accounted for

850
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,450
in terms of these
undirected material causes,

851
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,250
and so there's some other ---

852
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,850
So there has to be
an information source.

853
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,950
So one of the key questions
faced by modern Biology is,

854
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:02,050
"where do you get information from"?

855
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,850
Well, Darwin assumed

856
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,250
that the increase in information

857
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,450
comes from natural selection.

858
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,550
But natural selection
reduces genetic information,

859
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,150
and we know this from
all the genetic manipulation
studies that we have.

860
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,150
Where is the new genetic
information gonna come from?

861
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,250
Well, that's the big question.

862
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,950
So when we find information
in the DNA molecule,

863
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,550
The most likely explanation

864
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,050
is that it, too,
had an intelligent source.

865
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,550
We need engineering principles

866
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,950
to understand these systems, okay?

867
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,350
It's only because of our
advancements in nanotechnology

868
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,350
that we can even begin
to appreciate these systems.

869
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,150
<i>But using Intelligent Design</i>

870
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,550
<i>didn't seem to stop
the scientists I spoke with.</i>

871
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,250
<i>So why all the controversy?</i>

872
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,450
Suppose we find,
simply as a matter of fact,

873
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,550
that our scientific inquiries
point in one direction.

874
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,350
Which is that there is
an intelligent creator.

875
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,850
Why should we
eliminate that from discussion?

876
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,750
<i>Streng verboten?
How come? Why?</i>

877
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,950
<i>Streng verboten.
Very good.</i>

878
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,050
<i>What does streng verboten
mean, "strongly forbidden"?</i>

879
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,650
Strongly forbidden.

880
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,050
You've got two possible hypotheses.

881
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,250
You've got a wall
through the middle ---

882
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,050
--- through your brain,
in effect ---
through your thinking.

883
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,150
You say, well,
you can't consider anything
on this side of the wall.

884
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,250
Only hypotheses
on this side of the wall

885
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,050
are permissible
for consideration.

886
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,150
What about academic freedom?

887
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,950
I mean,
can't we just talk about this?

888
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,850
Their reply is that science
is not a democratic process.

889
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,950
Oh, really?

890
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,850
And that there is
a consensus view

891
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,050
and that we are to subscribe
to the consensual view.

892
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,950
Wait a second. Darwin challenged
the consensus view,

893
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,150
And that's how we got darwinism.

894
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,450
<i>If Darwin wanted to challenge
the consensus today,</i>

895
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,950
<i>How would he do it?</i>

896
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,250
<i>Science isn't a hobby
for rich aristocrats anymore.</i>

897
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,350
<i>It's a multibillion-dollar
industry.</i>

898
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,450
<i>And if you want
a piece of the pie,</i>

899
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,650
<i>You've got to be
a "good comrade."</i>

900
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,650
<i>Scientific ideas ---</i>

901
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,350
<i>How we get them to you,
the people.</i>

902
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,650
<i>Every idea must be inspected
to ensure that it is safe.</i>

903
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,450
<i>All theories must pass through
a series of checkpoints.</i>

904
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,050
<i>First --- the academy.</i>

905
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,250
<i>Getting a controversial theory</i>

906
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,850
<i>through the academy can be dangerous.</i>

907
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,150
<i>Few people know this better
than congressman Mark Souder.</i>

908
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,150
<i>He uncovered a targeted campaign</i>

909
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,450
<i>led by individuals within the
Smithsonian and the National Center
For Science Education</i>

910
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,850
<i>to destroy Dr. Sternberg's
credibility.</i>

911
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,250
If you want peer reviews,
if you want to be published,

912
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,850
if you want to go
to respected institutions,

913
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,850
the core view
does not tolerate dissent.

914
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,850
There's kind of a
"this is the way it is,"

915
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,550
and anybody who's a dissenter
should be squashed.

916
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,850
Are you going to be
on my side if I let you up?

917
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,650
Sure, chick, sure.
I'm on your side.

918
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,950
Just let me up.
I'll do anything you say.

919
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,550
<i>Souder isn't the only one
who has witnessed
the academy's tactics.</i>

920
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,350
<i>Journalist Larry Witham</i>

921
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,150
<i>has seen similar behavior
during his 25 years</i>

922
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,550
<i>of covering the
evolution controversy.</i>

923
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,350
Once you're thick in science,

924
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,450
you can't question the paradigm.

925
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,150
But if you want to get grants,

926
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,750
if you want to be elected
to high positions,

927
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,650
if you want to get awards
as a promoter

928
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,450
of public education of science,

929
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,350
You can't question the paradigm.

930
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,250
People cannot be trusted
to form their own opinions.

931
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,150
This business about
open-mindedness is nonsense.

932
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,450
<i>Why is the scientific establishment</i>

933
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,750
<i>so afraid of free speech?</i>

934
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,550
There is this fear

935
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,550
That if one aspect of a theory

936
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,650
is closely scrutinized,

937
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,950
there's going to be an unraveling.

938
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,250
Who are you?

939
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,250
Oh, uh ---

940
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,250
I am the great and powerful...

941
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,950
...Wizard of Oz.

942
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,950
I interviewed
dozens and dozens of scientists,

943
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,150
And when they're amongst each other

944
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,150
or talking to a journalist
who they trust,

945
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,850
they'll speak about,

946
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,750
umm, you know,
"it's incredibly complex,"

947
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,350
or "molecular biology
is in a crisis."

948
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,050
But publicly,
they can't say that.

949
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,950
<i>Keeping a keen eye
on the academy</i>

950
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,850
<i>are various
watchdog organizations.</i>

951
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,350
<i>Listen to Eugenie Scott</i>

952
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,950
<i>of the National Center
for Science Education.</i>

953
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,950
<i>The NCSE has been
at the heart</i>

954
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,350
<i>of virtually
every evolution controversy</i>

955
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,350
<i>over the past 25 years,</i>

956
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,050
<i>vigorously defending
the darwinian gospel.</i>

957
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,250
We have had a lot of business,

958
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,550
Unfortunately, at NCSE
in the last few years,

959
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,550
because virtually every state

960
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,050
in which science education standards

961
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,250
has come up for consideration

962
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,650
has had a big fight

963
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,350
about the coverage
of evolution in them.

964
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,350
NCSE was started by a group

965
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,850
of scientists and teachers

966
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,250
who were very concerned

967
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,550
because in the late '70s
and early '80s

968
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,350
there were a lot of attempts to pass

969
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,250
"equal time for creation science
and evolution" laws.

970
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,250
Clearly, this is something
that neither scientists
nor teachers liked.

971
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,150
It wasn't exactly "help, help,
the creationists are coming,"

972
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,950
but, you know, kind of
along those lines.

973
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,450
Most scientists just
throw up their hands and say,

974
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,350
"Creationists!
They drive me crazy.
You handle it."

975
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,350
We've worked a lot with
science education organizations.

976
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,250
The most important group
we work with

977
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,150
is members of the faith community,

978
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,950
because the best-kept secret
in this controversy

979
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,250
is that catholics
and mainstream protestants

980
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,750
are okay on evolution.

981
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,150
<i>Are you sure about that,
Eugenie?</i>

982
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,750
Liberal christians
have been fighting with

983
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,650
conservative christians
for so long

984
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,450
that they'll side with anybody
against the fundamentalists.

985
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,350
And Eugenie Scott says,
"well, welcome over."

986
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,650
There's a kind of
science defense lobby

987
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,550
or an evolution defense lobby,
in particular.

988
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,750
They are mostly atheists,

989
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,650
but they are wanting to ---
desperately wanting

990
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:56,250
to be friendly to mainstream,
sensible, religious people.

991
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,150
And the way you do that
is to tell them

992
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:03,250
That there's no incompatibility
between science and religion.

993
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,350
<i>But is there really
an incompatibility?</i>

994
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,550
<i>Can't we believe
in God and Darwin?</i>

995
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,950
Implicit in most evolutionary theory

996
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,650
Is that either there's no God,

997
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,250
Or God can't have any role in it.

998
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,450
So, naturally, as many
evolutionists will say,

999
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,350
it's the strongest engine
for atheism.

1000
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,150
If they called me as a witness,

1001
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,050
and a lawyer said,

1002
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,950
"Dr. Dawkins, has your belief
in evolution ---

1003
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,650
has your study of evolution
turned you towards atheism?"

1004
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,250
I would have to say *yes*.

1005
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,850
And that's the worst
possible thing I could say

1006
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,450
for winning that ---
that court case.

1007
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,350
So people like me are bad news

1008
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,550
for the science lobby,
the evolution lobby.

1009
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,150
By the way, I'm being
a hell of a lot

1010
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,750
more frank and honest
in this interview

1011
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,650
than many people
in this field would be.

1012
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,150
<i>Working hard
to keep ideas in check</i>

1013
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,150
<i>are our friends
in the media.</i>

1014
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,250
Morning paper!
Paper, mister?

1015
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,850
The tendency of the media is
to side with the establishment

1016
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,950
because they inherently agree
with the establishment.

1017
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,750
Eugenie Scott,
my understanding is

1018
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,950
that there is not a single
peer-reviewed article out there

1019
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,150
that supports Intelligent
Design. Am I wrong?

1020
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,750
You are not wrong.
You are correct.

1021
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,750
I believe that we get coverage,

1022
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,650
but we always get coverage
like we're the outsider,

1023
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,950
not like it's an even debate.

1024
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,550
<i>But instead of merely
reporting news,</i>

1025
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,450
<i>he analyzes it,
often expressing
his personal opinions.</i>

1026
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,150
We constantly deal
with reporters

1027
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,650
who refuse even to report

1028
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,850
the correct definition of
Intelligent Design.

1029
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,950
They, over and over again,
talk about

1030
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,250
"life is so complex,
God must have done it."

1031
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,550
- Let me explain...
- Admit it, it's religion.

1032
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,150
- It's very simple.
- You can't -- it's religion.

1033
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,350
It's a wanton distortion
of our position.

1034
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,350
City desk.

1035
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,650
I've got a hot story here.

1036
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,550
You can look at
Associated Press stories,

1037
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:03,250
And the same sentence will
appear in those stories
for 10 years:

1038
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,350
"Intelligent Design says
that life is too complex."

1039
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,850
It's called a boilerplate.

1040
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,750
And the reporter
never reports any more

1041
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,450
or gets any new ways to say it,

1042
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,550
So the public understanding
never advances.

1043
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,450
<i>But what happens
if a reporter</i>

1044
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,450
<i>Decides to take
a more balanced approach
to Intelligent Design?</i>

1045
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,650
There might be remarkable
pressure on that reporter

1046
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,050
not to side against
the evolutionists.

1047
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,350
I thought I told you
to kill that story.

1048
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,150
<i>Few reporters
have learned this better</i>

1049
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,350
<i>than author and journalist
Pamela Winnick.</i>

1050
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,550
<i>When she refused
to take sides</i>

1051
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,450
<i>in an article she wrote
about Intelligent Design,</i>

1052
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,350
<i>the darwinists found a
new favorite target.</i>

1053
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,550
Number one ---
I wasn't christian,
I was jewish.

1054
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,950
Number two ---
I wasn't religious.

1055
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,850
Number three ---
I was not taking

1056
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,250
A position in favor of creationism.

1057
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,750
I was writing about
Intelligent Design.

1058
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,450
And it didn't matter.

1059
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,850
After I wrote that one piece,

1060
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,150
Everything I wrote
on the subject was scrutinized.

1061
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,750
There were hate letters
coming into the newspaper.

1062
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,950
If you give any credence
to it whatsoever,

1063
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,350
which means just writing about it,

1064
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,750
you are just finished
as a journalist.

1065
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,350
<i>Other journalists
we spoke with</i>

1066
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,250
<i>Told similar stories but
didn't dare appear on camera.</i>

1067
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,750
<i>And now the presses
are ready to roll.</i>

1068
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,150
<i>When all other
checkpoints fail,</i>

1069
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,150
<i>there is always the courts.</i>

1070
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,350
We have spent an
enormous amount of time

1071
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,550
trying to prove to the court

1072
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,550
what everybody already knows,

1073
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,150
that Intelligent Design

1074
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,850
is a particular religious belief.

1075
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,750
<i>But I thought
scientific questions</i>

1076
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,350
<i>were settled
by the evidence,</i>

1077
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,450
<i>not by taking people
to court and suing them.</i>

1078
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,450
<i>How do other countries
deal with such disputes?</i>

1079
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:58,150
<i>Dr. Marciej Giertych,
a population geneticist</i>

1080
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:01,050
<i>who now represents Poland
in the European parliament,</i>

1081
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,550
<i>was able to shed
some light on this topic.</i>

1082
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:08,350
The censorship of teaching
criticism of evolution

1083
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,350
is and always was
much stronger in,

1084
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,850
say, your country,
the United States,

1085
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,550
than it ever was in Poland.

1086
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,850
Why?
Why would the censorship ---

1087
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,750
that's because you have
a political correctness
in your country.

1088
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,150
These issues are brought
to court,

1089
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,650
and the court says

1090
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,450
what you can and what you
cannot teach.

1091
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:32,350
We want to know what you teach,
what books you use,
how you teach it.

1092
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,150
We never had that sort of way

1093
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,150
of deciding scientific issues
in Poland.

1094
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,950
We never had the courts involved.

1095
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,250
So you are saying that

1096
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,750
As far as the teaching
of science is concerned,

1097
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,950
Poland is freer academically
than the United States?

1098
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,150
I think ---
in this particular issue

1099
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,050
of evolution,
I think this is true.

1100
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,050
<i>But how effective
are the courts</i>

1101
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,750
<i>in deciding such matters?</i>

1102
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,750
What about the general idea that
Intelligent Design

1103
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,250
is doomed as a result of
several recent legal setbacks?

1104
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,850
I think court cases
don't decide anything.

1105
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,950
If you look at the scopes trial,
who won that trial?

1106
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,250
It wasn't the evolutionists.
It was the ---

1107
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,350
the Tennessee Law was upheld,
barring evolution,

1108
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,350
And yet in the popular
imagination,

1109
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,750
Scopes is the hero.

1110
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,050
<i>Inherit the wind ---
that movie ---</i>

1111
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,750
which is really bogus history
based on the scopes trial,

1112
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,050
has carried the day.

1113
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,050
These issues go much deeper
than any decision by a judge.

1114
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,550
<i>The evolution debate</i>

1115
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,450
<i>does seem to run much deeper
than the courts,</i>

1116
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,150
<i>much deeper even
than science.</i>

1117
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,950
<i>To generate
this level of hostility,</i>

1118
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,450
<i>I.D. must threaten something
at the very core</i>

1119
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,350
<i>of the darwinian establishment.</i>

1120
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,450
<i>The entire globe</i>

1121
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,550
<i>is today the site
of a momentous conflict.</i>

1122
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,350
<i>It is the challenge of ideas.</i>

1123
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:56,950
I'm Edward R. Murrow.

1124
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,250
For a little while,

1125
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,950
I would like to review
with you

1126
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,250
The great conflict of our times,

1127
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,050
One which demands and must get

1128
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,850
the attention
and the involvement

1129
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,450
of each one of us.

1130
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,950
This conflict

1131
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,050
over the principles
of evolution

1132
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,250
has become a religious war.

1133
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,750
It really is no longer about
scientific investigation.

1134
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,950
It is total competition
with an antagonist

1135
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,250
Who is putting into it

1136
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,350
everything within his capability.

1137
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,950
<i>The situation
has reached a point</i>

1138
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,550
<i>where many of evolution's
top apologists</i>

1139
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,150
<i>have switched from
defending darwinism</i>

1140
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,850
<i>to attacking religion,
in what they see as a bid</i>

1141
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,650
<i>to stamp out
Intelligent Design at the source.</i>

1142
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,650
<i>Richard Dawkins is
the best example of this.</i>

1143
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,050
<i>His recent book,
"The God Delusion,</i>

1144
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,150
<i>Has sold over
one million copies worldwide.</i>

1145
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,250
<i>"The God Delusion"</i>

1146
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,950
is my long-expected,
long-worked-on,

1147
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,150
full-frontal attack
on religion.

1148
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,150
To me, science is about
trying to explain existence,

1149
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,050
And religion is about
trying to explain existence.

1150
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,450
It's just that religion
gets the wrong answer.

1151
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,250
<i>But is Dawkins correct?</i>

1152
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,550
<i>Are science and religion
really at war?</i>

1153
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,350
For an appraisal
of this continuing
and protracted conflict,

1154
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,050
we can go to a reporter

1155
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,950
who has watched
the growing conflict

1156
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,050
with the perception of
a trained military observer.

1157
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,450
<i>Oxford professor
Alister McGrath,</i>

1158
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,050
<i>Author of
The Dawkins Delusion,</i>

1159
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,550
<i>seemed like the ideal person
to answer my question.</i>

1160
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,950
Richard Dawkins has a charming

1161
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,350
and very, I think,
interesting view

1162
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,750
of the relationship between
science and religion.

1163
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,250
They're at war
with each other,

1164
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,450
and in the end,
one's got to win.

1165
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,550
And it's going to be science.

1166
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,150
It's a very nave view.

1167
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,850
It's based on a complete
historical misrepresentation

1168
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,250
of the way science and religion
have interacted.

1169
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,550
Dawkins seems to think
that scientific description

1170
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,850
is an anti-religious argument.

1171
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,850
Describing how something happens
scientifically

1172
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,150
somehow explains it away.

1173
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,150
It doesn't.

1174
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,050
But the questions of purpose,
intentionality,

1175
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,550
<i>The question why,</i>

1176
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,050
still remain there on the table.

1177
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,350
I think it was just a
catastrophic mistake

1178
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,650
to have someone like Dawkins
address himself

1179
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,450
to profound issues of theology,

1180
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,150
the existence of God,
the nature of life.

1181
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,650
He hasn't committed himself to

1182
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,150
disciplined study in any
relevant area of inquiry.

1183
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,750
He's a crummy philosopher.

1184
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,050
He doesn't have the
rudimentary skills

1185
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,450
to meticulously assess
his own arguments.

1186
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,950
Genius guy, though.

1187
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,150
Very smart guy.

1188
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,450
Little bit of a reptile,
but very smart guy.

1189
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,850
The opposing point of view
in this conflict

1190
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,250
rests on a fundamentally
different vision of man.

1191
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,250
If you have two
distinguished scientists ---

1192
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,550
and, in fact, you can range
many more on each side,
as you know ---

1193
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,550
saying exactly opposite things,

1194
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,850
that's telling me that the conflict

1195
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,950
Is not between science and
belief in God.

1196
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,850
Otherwise you'd expect
all scientists to be atheists.

1197
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,450
But it's a worldview conflict.

1198
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,150
It's between scientists
who have different worldviews.

1199
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,750
You've got two competing
explanations of the evidence.

1200
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,250
One says design,
one says undirected processes.

1201
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,150
Both of them have larger
philosophical or religious

1202
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,950
or anti-religious implications.

1203
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,250
So you can't say that
one of those two theories
is scientific

1204
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,950
and the other is unscientific

1205
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,850
simply because
they have implications.

1206
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,150
Both have implications.

1207
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:20,950
People who tell you,

1208
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,350
for example,
that science tells you

1209
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,750
all you need to know
about the world

1210
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,950
or that science tells you
that religion is all wrong

1211
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,550
or science tells you
there is no God,

1212
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,150
those people aren't telling
you scientific things.

1213
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,150
They are saying
metaphysical things,

1214
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,050
and they have to defend
their positions

1215
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,450
for metaphysical reasons.

1216
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,650
What is being presented
to the public is

1217
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,950
first comes the science,

1218
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,050
and then comes the worldview.

1219
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,850
I would want to argue that
that may not be the case,

1220
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,250
that it may actually be
the other way around,

1221
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,050
that the worldview comes first

1222
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,350
And is influencing
the interpretation of science.

1223
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,050
My deep regret is some people

1224
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:00,850
are so deeply entrenched
in their own worldviews

1225
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,550
that they will simply not
countenance alternatives.

1226
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,350
I'm actually a person of the left,

1227
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,250
and not even a particularly
religious person.

1228
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,050
I think of myself as
kind of humanist.

1229
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,650
and I think it's sending
a very bad message

1230
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,450
to religious people who
are interested in science,

1231
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,750
that in some sense,

1232
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,250
in order to do science credibly,

1233
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,650
they have to leave their
religious beliefs at the door.

1234
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,350
The founders of early
modern science ---

1235
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,850
Sir Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle,

1236
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,050
Johannes Kepler, Galileo, ---

1237
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,850
most of these early scientists

1238
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,550
all not only believed in God,

1239
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,150
but they thought
their belief in God

1240
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,550
actually made it easier
to do science.

1241
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,350
You can be religiously motivated

1242
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,650
and you can do good science,

1243
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,750
and they have more often
gone together

1244
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,250
than not gone together.

1245
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,050
Admitting our biases

1246
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,950
is the best way towards
rational discussion,

1247
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,550
which I would welcome.

1248
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,550
<i>Rational debate
is a nice thought,</i>

1249
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,650
<i>but it's nearly impossible
in the current climate.</i>

1250
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,250
<i>I'd seen the chilling effect</i>

1251
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,150
<i>that this unquestioning
devotion to Darwinism</i>

1252
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,350
<i>has had on science...</i>

1253
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,550
<i>but were there
other consequences?</i>

1254
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:11,050
No gods,
no life after death,

1255
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,150
no ultimate foundation
for ethics,

1256
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,850
no ultimate meaning in life,

1257
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,450
and no human free will

1258
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:24,550
are all deeply connected
to an evolutionary perspective.

1259
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,150
You're here today
and then gone tomorrow,

1260
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,850
and that's all there is to it.

1261
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,850
<i>Dr. Will Provine,</i>

1262
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,150
<i>professor of History of Biology</i>

1263
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,950
<i>at Cornell University,</i>

1264
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,450
<i>gave us another
disturbing glimpse</i>

1265
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,550
<i>into where darwinism
can lead.</i>

1266
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,050
Oh, I was a christian,

1267
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,250
But I never heard
anything about evolution

1268
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,150
because it was illegal
to teach it in Tennessee.

1269
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,950
<i>Dr. Provine's first Biology
professor changed all that.</i>

1270
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,550
He started talking
about evolution

1271
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,250
as if it had no design
in it whatsoever.

1272
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,050
And I came up to him,
and I said,

1273
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,150
"you left out
the most important part."

1274
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,550
And he said,
"if you feel the same way
at the end of one quarter,

1275
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,850
I want you to stand up
in front of the students
in this class

1276
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,950
and tell them this deep lack
in evolution."

1277
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:15,050
And I read that book
so carefully,

1278
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,850
and I could find
no sign of there being

1279
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:22,450
any design whatsoever
in evolution.

1280
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,650
And I immediately began to doubt

1281
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,150
the existence of the deity.

1282
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,950
But it starts by giving up
an active deity.

1283
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,750
then he gives up the hope

1284
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,850
that there is
any life after death.

1285
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,150
When you give those two up,

1286
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,050
the rest of it follows
fairly easily.

1287
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,350
You give up the hope

1288
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,150
that there's an eminent morality.

1289
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:48,350
And finally, there's
no human free will.

1290
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,250
If you believe in evolution,

1291
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,750
you can't hope for there
being any free will.

1292
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,350
There's no hope whatsoever

1293
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:00,950
of there being any
deep meaning in human life.

1294
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,850
We live, we die,
and we're gone.

1295
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,150
We're absolutely gone
when we die.

1296
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,250
<i>Dr. Provine is no stranger
to the prospect of death.</i>

1297
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,850
<i>Nearly a decade ago,</i>

1298
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:15,150
<i>he was diagnosed
with a large brain tumor.</i>

1299
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,150
Let's suppose
my tumor comes back,

1300
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,050
as it almost certainly will.

1301
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,250
Well, I'm not
going to sit around

1302
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,150
like my older brother
did last year.

1303
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,750
And he was dying of alz,
Lou Gehrig's disease.

1304
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,750
He wanted desperately to die,
but we couldn't help him die.

1305
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,350
I don't want to die like that.

1306
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,850
I'm going to shoot myself
in the head long before then.

1307
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,250
I'm going to do
something different.

1308
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,350
<i>I hope these are empty words</i>

1309
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,450
<i>from my friend Dr. Provine,</i>

1310
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,150
<i>because shortly after
this interview was recorded</i>

1311
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,750
<i>he learned his brain tumor
had returned.</i>

1312
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,650
I don't feel one bit bad

1313
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,450
about holding the views that I do.

1314
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,050
There's not anything
in the views I hold

1315
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:59,150
that makes me, "oh,
I wish I had free will,"

1316
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,450
or "Oh, I wish there were a God."

1317
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,550
I don't ever, ever wish for that.

1318
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,050
<i>Dr. Provine's
de-conversion story</i>

1319
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,750
<i>was typical amongst
the darwinists we interviewed.</i>

1320
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,950
<i>Biologist P.Z. Myers,</i>

1321
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:16,350
<i>who runs the pro-Darwin,
anti-religion blog Pharyngula,</i>

1322
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:19,550
<i>says science eroded
his faith as well.</i>

1323
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,850
I never hated religion.

1324
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,150
I found religion
quite comfortable,

1325
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,750
and I liked the people in it.

1326
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,850
What led to the atheism was
learning more about science,

1327
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,850
learning more about
the natural world,

1328
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,450
and seeing these horrible
conflicts with religion.

1329
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,850
And it was then,
when I discovered evolution,

1330
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,450
when I discovered darwinism,

1331
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,150
that I realized there's
this magnificently elegant,

1332
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,550
stunningly elegant
explanation ---

1333
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,950
which I didn't quite
understand to begin with ---

1334
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,450
but when I did understand it,

1335
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:51,450
then that finally killed off
my remaining religious faith.

1336
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,150
<i>After hearing these stories,</i>

1337
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,150
<i>I was not surprised
to discover</i>

1338
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,250
<i>that most evolutionary
biologists</i>

1339
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,750
<i>share professor Dawkins' views.</i>

1340
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,550
<i>It appears darwinism
does lead to atheism</i>

1341
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:05,750
<i>despite what Eugenie Scott
wanted us us believe.</i>

1342
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:11,450
And if you separate out
the ethical message from religion,

1343
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:14,050
what have you got left?

1344
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:17,250
You've got a bunch
of fairy tales, right?

1345
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,450
I think that God
is about as unlikely

1346
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:25,850
as fairies, angels,
hobgoblins, etc.

1347
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,450
Religion ---I mean,
it's just fantasy, basically.

1348
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:34,750
It's completely empty
of any explanatory content...

1349
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,350
and is evil as well.

1350
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,350
Half the people in this country
think that drugs

1351
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,750
is what you have to regulate
to make us safer,

1352
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,050
and half the people think guns,

1353
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,050
that's what you gotta regulate
to make us safer.

1354
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,250
But I always think that
if you're going to regulate

1355
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,350
one thing that has
the most potential

1356
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:53,350
to cause death and destruction:
religion.

1357
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,350
You gotta start with religion.

1358
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:02,050
Religion is an idea that
gives some people comfort,

1359
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,250
and we don't want to take
it away from them.

1360
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,950
It's like knitting.
People like to knit.

1361
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,550
We're not going to take
their knitting needles away.

1362
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,750
We're not going to take away
their churches.

1363
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,950
But what we have to do
is get it to a place

1364
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,350
where religion is treated

1365
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,150
at the level it should be treated.

1366
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,450
That is, something fun

1367
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,250
that people get together
and do on the weekend

1368
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,050
and really
doesn't affect their life

1369
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,950
as much as it has been so far.

1370
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:30,450
<i>So what would the world look like</i>

1371
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,650
<i>if Dr. Meyers got his wish?</i>

1372
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,950
Greater science literacy,

1373
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,850
which is going to lead
to the erosion of religion,

1374
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,550
and then we'll get this nice
positive feedback mechanism going,

1375
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,950
where as religion slowly
fades away,

1376
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,850
we get more and more science
to replace it.

1377
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,850
And that will displace
more and more religion,

1378
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,950
which will allow
more and more science in,

1379
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,050
and we'll eventually
get to that point

1380
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,650
where religion has taken
that appropriate place

1381
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:55,250
as a side dish
rather than the main course.

1382
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,850
<i>But will
eradicating religion</i>

1383
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,250
<i>really lead to a modern utopia?</i>

1384
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,550
<i>Hmmm.</i>

1385
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,850
<i>Let me try to imagine that.</i>

1386
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,350
<i>And let's let History
be our guide.</i>

1387
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,150
In part, I think Matthew Arnold

1388
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:19,450
put his hands on it
when he spoke about

1389
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,950
ummm, the withdrawal of faith.

1390
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,250
There is a connection
between a society

1391
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,550
that has at least
a minimal commitment

1392
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:30,050
to certain kinds of
transcendental values

1393
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,150
and what human beings
permit themselves

1394
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,250
to do one to the other.

1395
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,050
<i>That got me thinking:</i>

1396
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,750
<i>what other societies
have used darwinism</i>

1397
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,350
<i>to trump
all other authorities,</i>

1398
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,050
<i>including religion?</i>

1399
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,450
<i>As a jew,</i>

1400
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,150
<i>my mind leapt to one regime
in particular.</i>

1401
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,750
The connection between
Hitler and Darwin

1402
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,350
is of course historically
a difficult connection

1403
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,750
because they were separated
by a good many years.

1404
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,550
One was English, one was German.

1405
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:59,250
<i>Nonetheless, if you open
Mein Kampf and read it ---</i>

1406
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,650
especially if you can
read it in German ---

1407
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,550
the correspondence between
darwinian ideas

1408
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,250
and nazi ideas just leaps
from the page.

1409
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,850
Of course you have to add
every historical caution.

1410
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:13,350
Not everyone who read Darwin
became a nazi, obviously not.

1411
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,150
No one is making that case.

1412
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,750
Darwinism is not a
sufficient condition

1413
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:20,750
for a phenomenon like nazism,

1414
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:23,750
but I think it's certainly
a necessary one.

1415
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,950
<i>This was a connection
I had to explore personally.</i>

1416
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,350
<i>American officers arrive
at a Nazi institution</i>

1417
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,550
<i>seized by first army troops.</i>

1418
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,350
<i>Under the guise of
an insane asylum,</i>

1419
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,850
<i>this has been
the headquarters</i>

1420
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,250
<i>for the systematic murder...</i>

1421
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,750
So, what is this place?

1422
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,450
During the second world war,

1423
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,450
15,000 people were killed here.

1424
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,250
Why were they killed?

1425
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,750
They were killed because
they were people with handicaps.

1426
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,950
Why kill them?
What's the point of killing them?

1427
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,750
People who were not able to work,

1428
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,050
people who were not able
to live by themselves,

1429
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,950
that they were "useless eaters."

1430
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,250
"Useless eaters."

1431
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,150
And "life unworthy of living."

1432
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,650
This idea grew up in the '20s,

1433
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,750
so long before national socialism;

1434
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,550
biologists, anthropologists,

1435
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,050
they thought that maybe
mankind could ---

1436
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,250
or the government could interfere

1437
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,550
- into the growth of the population.
- I see.

1438
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,650
And they had the... utopia?

1439
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,150
- Utopia.
- Utopia...

1440
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,150
that they would have a society

1441
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:45,650
without illness and without handicap.

1442
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,750
So this was a darwinian concept.

1443
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,850
- Yes.
- And also a malthusian concept,

1444
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,250
very much malthusian.

1445
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,850
- Malthusian?
- Thomas Malthus, who said

1446
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:21,250
that there was a
shortage of resources.

1447
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,350
English philosopher,
said there was a shortage ---

1448
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,150
Yes, but the nazis,
they relied on Darwin.

1449
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:30,150
- They relied on Darwin.
- Yes, Darwin and german scientists.

1450
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,250
<i>Patients were led
down this hallway</i>

1451
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,850
<i>to nazi doctors,</i>

1452
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:39,850
<i>who decided who would live
and who would die.</i>

1453
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:45,950
They were accompanied by 15,
umm, 15 nurses.

1454
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,150
- Nurses.
- Nurses.

1455
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,750
Male and female nurses.

1456
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,550
So nurses were helping
lead them to their doom.

1457
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,850
Yes.

1458
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,150
So, were the prisoners told
they were taking a shower?

1459
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,450
Yes, they were taking a shower,

1460
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:17,950
and here was one or two showers.

1461
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,550
So, how many people were
brought into this room?

1462
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,250
Sixty to seventy.

1463
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,750
So, what is this?

1464
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,950
This is the dissection table.

1465
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:38,250
Do you ever think to yourself

1466
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,750
the sane ones were the ones

1467
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,050
lying here having
their brains removed ---

1468
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,150
the insane one was Dr. Gorgass
and all the other people ---?

1469
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,750
No, no, I don't think that,

1470
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,850
because I think those people
who killed here,

1471
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:53,350
they were very sane because
they had their purposes.

1472
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,450
They had purposes?

1473
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,450
Yes. I don't think they were insane.

1474
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,050
- They had two crematory ovens.
- I see.

1475
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,350
And they killed about 70 people

1476
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,950
- a day.
- A day, so they had ---

1477
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,750
That's barely enough time.
They had their work ---

1478
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:20,350
They only killed from
Monday to Friday, so...

1479
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,250
Because the people who
were doing the killing

1480
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,750
needed to have the weekend off.

1481
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:28,850
If you met Dr. Gorgass today,
what would you say to him?

1482
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,650
I don't know.

1483
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:33,950
I don't think that it's my
--- my role

1484
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,950
To --- to tell him something.

1485
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,550
<i>It's difficult to describe</i>

1486
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:42,650
<i>how it felt to walk
through such a haunting place,</i>

1487
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,350
<i>to know that these cold
stone and tile walls</i>

1488
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:49,950
<i>were the last things
the victims of Hadamar ever saw.</i>

1489
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,550
<i>I wanted to explore
this connection further,</i>

1490
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:59,050
<i>so I met with the author of
"From Darwin to Hitler",</i>

1491
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,550
<i>Dr. Richard Weikart.</i>

1492
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,450
Hitler and many of the physicians

1493
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,950
that carried out this program

1494
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,850
were very fanatical darwinists

1495
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:11,050
and particularly wanted to apply
darwinism to society.

1496
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,550
Many of these people in the
19-teens, 1920s,

1497
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:38,350
who were putting forward some
of these ideas about racism

1498
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,650
were considered
the leading scientists.

1499
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,550
These were darwinists
who were taken seriously
by fellow academics.

1500
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,750
It's not to say that
all academics believed it.

1501
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:51,250
These leading academics,
were there any of them
who were Americans?

1502
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,650
There were plenty of Americans

1503
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:55,350
who were saying
similar kinds of things.

1504
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,550
<i>Not only were Americans
saying such things,</i>

1505
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,550
<i>they were pioneers
in this fledging science</i>

1506
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,850
<i>known as eugenics.</i>

1507
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,250
<i>They thought they could help
evolution along,</i>

1508
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,850
<i>by sterilizing
the so-called feeble-minded</i>

1509
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:13,550
<i>and prohibiting them
from getting married.</i>

1510
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,650
Physicians who are
aware of the history of

1511
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,550
20th-century American medicine

1512
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:22,350
harbor some bad feelings
towards darwinists

1513
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,950
Because of eugenics.

1514
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:25,350
And eugenics ---

1515
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:28,250
which was an attempt
to breed human beings ---

1516
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,850
it was the darkest chapter
of American medicine ever.

1517
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,950
There were 50,000 people
involuntarily sterilized

1518
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,250
because they were deemed
unfit to breed, basically.

1519
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,950
<i>Eugenics isn't just history.</i>

1520
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,550
<i>The spirit of the movement
lives on today.</i>

1521
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,250
Margaret Sanger was

1522
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,950
the head of planned parenthood.

1523
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,650
She was very fanatical
in her promotion of eugenics.

1524
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,650
In fact, planned parenthood
was all about birth control

1525
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,350
for the impoverished
and lower classes

1526
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,450
to try to help improve
the species.

1527
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,250
<i>From Hadamar,</i>

1528
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,450
<i>I traveled with Dr. Weikart
to Dachau,</i>

1529
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,150
<i>where the nazis applied
the ideas of eugenics</i>

1530
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,750
<i>on a massive mechanistic scale.</i>

1531
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,650
When it was a fully functioning
concentration camp,

1532
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,450
uh, what was the purpose of it?

1533
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:29,550
I mean, part of it was
to repress political enemies.

1534
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:31,550
What was the rest of the purpose?

1535
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,150
Well, beyond the repression
of the political enemies,

1536
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:36,050
which was its purpose
at the very beginning,

1537
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,850
then later on it transformed
into repressing racial enemies.

1538
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,250
And sometimes
those categories overlapped

1539
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,550
because sometimes they thought

1540
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,650
that these people were
political enemies,

1541
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,050
<i>because they were
inferior biologically.</i>

1542
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,450
The war itself was part of

1543
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:52,150
the darwinian struggle
for existence, for Hitler.

1544
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:54,350
And he saw that
extermination of the jews

1545
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:58,550
as one of those fronts
to this warfare going on,

1546
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,250
As this darwinian struggle
for existence.

1547
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,550
Would you say that
Hitler was insane?

1548
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,250
No, I wouldn't say he was insane.

1549
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:11,150
I think he had imbibed some
very, very wrong ideas,

1550
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,450
and, in fact, I think

1551
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:16,750
he took the logic of them
in certain ways

1552
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:20,550
that brought him to take

1553
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:23,450
very radical solutions for them.

1554
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,650
Would you say he was evil?

1555
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,250
Oh, I'd definitely say
he was evil.

1556
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,650
Is there such a thing as evil?

1557
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,850
Oh, I think there is.

1558
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,650
And is there such a thing as good?

1559
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,250
Oh, definitely.

1560
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:38,850
And... evil can sometimes
be rationalized as science.

1561
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,050
Oh, sure.

1562
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,650
And evil can sometimes
be rationalized ---

1563
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,250
When it's rationalized
as science, and

1564
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,750
I think when it was rationalized
in this particular way,

1565
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,450
I think Hitler thought
he was doing good.

1566
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,650
He thought he was doing good?

1567
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,850
Oh, I think so.

1568
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,850
He thought he was
benefiting humanity

1569
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,550
By driving evolution forward

1570
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,350
and creating a better humanity.

1571
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,950
<i>Before leaving Dachau,</i>

1572
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,650
<i>I stopped by the memorial</i>

1573
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,050
<i>commemorating the
thousands of jews</i>

1574
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:13,050
<i>who were killed there
in excruciating conditions.</i>

1575
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,450
<i>I know that darwinism</i>

1576
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:20,750
<i>does not automatically
equate to nazism.</i>

1577
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:23,450
<i>But if darwinism
inspired and justified</i>

1578
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,650
<i>such horrific events
in the past,</i>

1579
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,250
<i>could it be used
to rationalize</i>

1580
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,650
<i>similar initiatives today?</i>

1581
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,650
<i>There's a good German expression,
"so faengt es immer an."</i>

1582
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,850
I mean,
"always begins in the same way,"

1583
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,650
something to remember
in the context of

1584
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:39,250
the United States' discussions
of euthanasia and abortion.

1585
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:40,750
It always begins in the same way.

1586
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,750
There seems to be
an excellent argument

1587
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:45,650
for getting rid of useless people
by killing them.

1588
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,950
Or at least it seems excellent

1589
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,150
to the people advancing the argument.

1590
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,650
It's the love affair with death

1591
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,150
and, you know, the euthanasia
and this movement going on,

1592
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,350
which I find appalling.

1593
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,650
And the idea is that,
you know,

1594
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,350
immediately rid our society

1595
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,150
of anybody who might be a drain

1596
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,350
and think of people in economic terms,

1597
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,250
and I think that's where some
of the Darwin fits in, actually.

1598
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,450
It's just a devaluing of human life.

1599
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,350
First of all, if you take seriously

1600
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,150
that evolution has to do with

1601
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,350
the transition of life forms

1602
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:16,350
and that life and death
are just natural processes,

1603
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:19,850
then one gets to be liberal
about abortion and euthanasia.

1604
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,450
All of those kinds of ideas,

1605
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,550
seem to me, follow very naturally

1606
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,450
from a darwinian perspective,

1607
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,150
a de-privileging of human beings,
basically.

1608
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,550
And I think that people
who want to endorse darwinism

1609
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:35,150
have to sort of take this kind of
viewpoint very seriously.

1610
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,350
And when we see an elite ---
and it is an elite ---

1611
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,150
an elite that controls essentially

1612
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,250
all the research money in science,

1613
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:46,050
saying, "there is no
such thing as moral truth;

1614
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,850
science will not be
related to religion."

1615
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,750
I mean, it's essentially
official policy of

1616
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,650
the National Academy of Science

1617
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,250
that religion and science
will not be related.

1618
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,250
I mean, hey, that cuts off
a lot of debate, doesn't it?

1619
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,650
What's going to happen
if this doesn't change?

1620
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,050
I think we're watching
it happen, aren't we?

1621
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,950
<i>I needed time to think,</i>

1622
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,150
<i>so I traveled to the birthplace
of this idea.</i>

1623
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:07,750
<i>"with savages,
the weak in body or mind</i>

1624
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,450
<i>are soon eliminated.</i>

1625
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,350
<i>we civilized men,
on the other hand,</i>

1626
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,950
<i>do our utmost to check
the process of elimination.</i>

1627
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:20,150
<i>we build asylums
for the imbecile,
the maimed, and the sick.</i>

1628
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:22,850
<i>thus the weak members
of civilized societies</i>

1629
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,750
<i>propagate their kind.</i>

1630
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,950
<i>no one who has attended
to the breeding</i>

1631
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,350
<i>of domestic animals</i>

1632
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,650
<i>will doubt that this
must be highly injurious</i>

1633
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,550
<i>to the race of man.</i>

1634
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,650
<i>Hardly anyone
is so ignorant</i>

1635
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,950
<i>as to allow
his worst animals to breed."</i>

1636
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:42,950
<i>--- Charles Darwin,
"The Descent of Man", 1871.</i>

1637
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,050
Throughout the Cold War in Germany,

1638
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,750
there was this wall erected
to keep ideas out.

1639
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,350
It was erected by people
who held an ideology,

1640
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,750
that were afraid of a competition

1641
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:38,050
from other ideas that would come
into their society.

1642
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:40,650
And what we're seeing
happening in science today

1643
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,250
is very much like that.

1644
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,950
But I think that's just a strategy

1645
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:48,150
for protecting a failing ideology
from competition.

1646
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,350
<i>America didn't become
the great nation that it is</i>

1647
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,150
<i>by suppressing ideas.</i>

1648
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:55,150
<i>It progressed by allowing
freedom of speech</i>

1649
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,050
<i>and freedom of inquiry.</i>

1650
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,550
<i>Thomas Jefferson got it right
when he wrote,</i>

1651
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,950
<i>"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,</i>

1652
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:05,450
<i>"that all men

1660
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,050
<i>It wasn't just scientists
who were being expelled.</i>

1661
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,550
<i>It was freedom itself,</i>

1662

<i>the very foundation of the
American Dream,</i>

01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,450
<i>the very foundation of America.</i>

1664
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,750
<i>If we allowed freedom
to be expelled in science,</i>

1665
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,950
<i>where would it end?</i>

<i>The darwinian establishment</i>

1667
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:42,450
<i>is so massive and so entrenched,</i>

1668
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:44,450
<i>it appears impenetrable.</i>

1669
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:46,550
<i>I couldn't bring it down myself,</i>

1670
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,150
<i>but I could at least confront</i>

1671
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:50,250
<i>those who'd expelled
the scientists I'd met.</i>

1672
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:56,550
What would you say if you had
Eugenie Scott sitting next to you?

1673
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,750
What would you say to her?

1674
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,850
I would ask her by what authority

1675
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,150
does she and those like her

1676
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,450
presume to declare

1677
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,250
what is and is not science.

1678
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,750
He's sort of made himself
martyr of the day.

1679
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,550
They've gotten
a lot of mileage out of,

1680
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:15,350
you know, poor Rick Sternberg.

1681
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,750
And we got lip service

1682
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:18,950
from the leadership
of the Smithsonian,

1683
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,750
but I didn't feel they
ever followed through.

1684
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:24,650
<i>We went into the smithsonian
looking for answers,</i>

1685
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:28,250
<i>but we ran into the same
stone wall as congressman Souder.</i>

1686
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,350
You're not authorized
to do this here, so stop.

01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,950
He said, "nonetheless,
you have to be disciplined,"

1688
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,350

1689
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:42,950
<i>We did get an interview</i>

01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,150
Her contract was not renewed.

1693
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:54,550
It was simply, um,
not renewing her contract,

1694
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,050
Which she satisfied.

1695
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,250
Her contract was not renewed.

1696
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,150
It had nothing to do
with the controversy

1697
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,150
of that topic of Intelligent Design.

1698
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:10,650
I have never been treated
like this in my ---

1699
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,850
about 30 years in academia.

1700
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:16,650
<i>We received a similar reception
at Baylor University.</i>

1701
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:17,950
<i>They refused to admit</i>

01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,750
<i>that what had happened

<i>had anything to do with I.D.</i>

1704
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:25,150

the Intelligent Design situation

1706
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,750
has not been the thrust
of the conversation.

1707
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,850
It was a procedural issue,

1708
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,050
and that's the way we dealt with it.

1709
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,950
<i>Funny, that's not how

What we wanted to stop is
the use of the name of I.S.U.

1718
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:04,650
to validate Intelligent Design.

1719
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,350
And we did succeed.

1720
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:09,050
I really think a lot of Guillermo.
He's a great guy.

1721
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:11,150
So that's why I'm
kind of disappointed.

1722
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,050
He should've just left this alone,

1723
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:15,150
in my opinion, should've
just left it alone.

1724
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,450
<i>Dr. Hauptman elaborated further</i>

1725
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,950
<i>on his great regard for Gonzalez.</i>

1726
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,050
Uh, this is quoting an e-mail
from you to Mr. Avalos.

1727
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:27,850
You say, "sometimes it is just best
to ignore idiots,"

1728
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,750
In reference to Guillermo.

1729
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33,350
And then, "the religious nutcases

1730
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,350
should be challenged
at every opportunity."

1731
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,650
Yeah, because, for example,

1732
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:41,050
You ---

1733
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,950
In that case,
i'm thinking more of,

1734
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:45,850
say, the creationist crowd,
who claims that God

1735
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:48,550
put all the animals
on an ark, and that's it.

1736
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,050
That's where all of our animals
came from today.

1737
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,450
That's crazy, okay?

1738
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,650
You shouldn't be insulting

1739
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:55,450
even children with
that kind of thing.

1740
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:57,350
So these are the idiots,
all right?

1741
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:58,750
They've always been around.

1742
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,850
They've always been around.

1743
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,950
<i>Going after the perpetrators
in each of these cases</i>

1744
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,050
<i>wasn't getting me anywhere.</i>

1745
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:09,650
<i>So I reconnected with Dr. Berlinski
and Dr. Schroeder</i>

1746
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,350
<i>to see if they had any advice.</i>

1747
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,550
There's a boundary

1748
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,750
to what science will accept right now.

1749
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,950
I think the parallel is exactly
this wall coming down.

1750
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:26,850
Ask any Berliner
from the East side

1751
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:29,850
what it meant to have the wall
come down.

1752
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:34,150
If it is possible to make
a break in the wall,

1753
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,550
that would allow academia

1754
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,150
to ask these fundamental
questions that exist,

1755
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:42,050
and allow them in the
science classrooms as well.

1756
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,650
It'd be nice to see
the scientific establishment

1757
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,250
lose some of its prestige and power.

1758
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,050
It'd be nice to see other questions
being opened up.

1759
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:53,650
Above all, it would be nice

1760
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:56,450
to have a real spirit of
self-criticism

1761
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,950
penetrating the sciences.

1762
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:02,150
What can I do to bring down the wall?

1763
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,750
Is there anything I can do?

1764
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,450
Make it apparent to the world

1765
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,850
that a wall exists.

1766
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:08,950
There are vast numbers of persons

1767
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,150
who talk about academic freedom,

1768
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,550
and there is academic freedom,

1769
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,350
as long as you're on the
correct side of the wall.

1770
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,650
But if you're on the wrong side
of the wall,

1771
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,950
as you mentioned a few moments ago,

1772
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:23,150
you lose tenure,
and that's a given.

1773
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:26,250
<i>I took Dr. Schroeder's words
to heart.</i>

1774
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,250
<i>Obviously I couldn't
take down the wall myself,</i>

1775
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,050
<i>but I could confront
one of its modern architects.</i>

1776
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:27,750
Hello, professor Dawkins.
How are you?

1777
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,250
I'm Ben Stein, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

1778
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,550
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1779
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,850
You have ---
you have written

1780
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,350
that God is a psychotic delinquent

1781
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,950
invented by mad, deluded people.

1782
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,450
No, I didn't say quite that.

1783
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,350
I said something
rather better than that.

1784
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:46,650
Oh, well, please tell us
what you said.

1785
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:49,050
Well, I would have to read it
from the book.

1786
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,950
No, please.

1787
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,350
"The God of the Old Testament

1788
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,550
is arguably the most
unpleasant character

1789
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:55,850
in all fiction ---

1790
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,250
jealous and proud of it,

1791
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,350
a petty, unjust, unforgiving
control freak,

1792
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:03,150
a vindictive, bloodthirsty
ethnic cleanser,

1793
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,950
a misogynistic, homophobic,

1794
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:08,450
racist, infanticidal,
genocidal, filicidal,

1795
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,650
pestilential, megalomaniacal,

1796
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,050
sadomasochistic,

1797
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:13,950
capriciously malevolent bully."

1798
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:16,050
- So that's what you think of God.
- Yeah.

1799
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,950
How about if people
believed in a God

1800
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,350
of infinite lovingness
and kindness

1801
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:23,050
and forgiveness and generosity,

1802
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,250
sort of like the modern-day God.

1803
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,950
Why spoil it for them?

1804
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:31,650
- Oh, um ---
- Why not just let them
have their fun and enjoy it?

1805
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,250
I don't want to spoil
anything for anybody.

1806
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:37,150
I write a book.
People can read it
if they want to.

1807
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:40,350
I believe that it is
a liberating thing

1808
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:44,550
to free yourself
from primitive superstition.

1809
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:46,150
So religion's a primitive
superstition?

1810
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,750
Oh, I think it is, yes.

1811
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,250
So, uh, you believe
it's liberating

1812
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:53,050
to tell people
that there is no God.

1813
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,550
I think a lot of people,
when they give up God,

1814
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:59,450
feel a great sense
of release and freedom.

1815
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:00,950
Why do you think that?

1816
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,850
- You're a scientist.
What's your data?
- Well, I...

1817
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,150
Well, I've had a lot
of letters saying that.

1818
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:08,350
There're eight billion people
in the world, dr. Dawkins.

1819
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,350
Yeah, I know, I know...

1820
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:10,950
How many letters have you had?

1821
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:12,950
No, I--
that's quite true.

1822
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:16,850
<i>Professor Dawkins
seemed so convinced
that God doesn't exist</i>

1823
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:20,050
<i>that I wondered if he
would be willing to put
a number on it.</i>

1824
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,050
Well, it's hard to put
a figure on it,

1825
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,150
but I'd put it as something like,

1826
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,750
you know, 99% against
or something ---

1827
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:29,750
Well, how do you know
it's 99% and not, say, 97%?

1828
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:32,050
I don't. You asked me
to put a figure on it,

1829
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,950
and I'm not comfortable
putting a figure on it.

1830
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:38,050
I think it's ---
I just think it's very unlikely.

1831
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:40,550
But you couldn't put a number on it.

1832
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:41,550
No, of course not.

1833
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:43,450
So it could be 49%.

1834
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:47,650
Well, it would be ---
I mean, I think it's unlikely,

1835
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,050
And it's quite far from 50%.

1836
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:52,250
How do you know?

1837
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,450
I don't know.

1838
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:56,050
I mean, I put an argument
in the book.

1839
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,750
Then who did create
the heavens and the earth?

1840
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,150
Why do you use the word "who?"

1841
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:00,850
You see, you immediately beg
the question

1842
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:02,150
by using the word "who."

1843
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,950
Then how did it get created?

1844
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:09,050
Well, um...
By a very slow process.

1845
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,350
Well, how did it start?

1846
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,450
Nobody knows how it got started.

1847
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,550
<i>We know the kind of event
that it must've been.</i>

1848
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,650
We know the sort of event
that must've happened

1849
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,450
- for the origin of life.
- What was that?

1850
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,550
It was the origin of the first
self-replicating molecule.

1851
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,350
Right, and how did that happen?

1852
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:26,550
I've told you, we don't know.

1853
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:28,550
So you have no idea how it started?

1854
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,650
No, no. Nor has anybody.

1855
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,750
Nor has anyone else.

1856
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,450
What do you think is the possibility

1857
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:34,950
that Intelligent Design

1858
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,450
might turn out to be

1859
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:39,550
the answer to some issues
in Genetics

1860
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,750
or in evolution?

1861
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,850
It could come about
in the following way.

1862
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:47,650
It could be that
at some earlier time,

1863
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,150
aomewhere in the universe,

1864
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:52,250
a civilization evolved

1865
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:54,950
by probably some kind
of darwinian means

1866
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,750
to a very, very high level
of technology

1867
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,950
and Designed a form of life

1868
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:02,950
that they seeded onto,
perhaps, this planet.

1869
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:08,550
Now, that is a possibility
and an intriguing possibility,

1870
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,350
and I suppose it's possible
that you might find
evidence for that.

1871
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,750
If you look at the detail ---

1872
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,550
details of biochemistry,
molecular biology,

1873
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:20,850
you might find a signature
of some sort of designer.

1874
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,150
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1875
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:25,050
<i>Richard Dawkins
thought Intelligent Design</i>

1876
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,850
<i>might be a legitimate pursuit?</i>

1877
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:30,950
And that designer could well be
a higher intelligence

1878
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:33,550
from elsewhere in the universe.

1879
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:35,250
- Well ---
- But that higher intelligence

1880
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,650
would itself have had to have
come about

1881
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,850
by some explicable or ultimately
explicable process.

1882
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:45,550
It couldn't have just jumped
into existence spontaneously.
That's the point.

1883
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:50,250
<i>So professor Dawkins
was not against
Intelligent Design,</i>

1884
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,950
<i>just certain types
of designers,</i>

1885
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,950
<i>such as God.</i>

1886
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,450
So the hebrew god,

1887
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,150
the god of the Old Testament--

1888
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,250
he doesn't exist in your view?

1889
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,250
Uh, certainly.

1890
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:05,050
I mean, that would be
a very unpleasant prospect.

1891
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,250
And the Holy Trinity
of the New Testament ---

1892
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,850
No, nothing like that.

1893
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:12,450
Do you believe in any of
the hindu gods?

1894
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,450
- Like Vishnu?
- How can you ask such a question?

1895
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:15,650
- You don't, right?
- How could I?

1896
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:16,650
I mean, why would I,

1897
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,350
given that I don't believe
in any others?

1898
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,850
You don't believe
in the muslim god.

1899
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:23,350
No. Why do you even need to ask?

1900
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:24,850
I just wanted to be sure.

1901
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:28,550
So you don't believe
in any god anywhere.

1902
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:32,150
Any god anywhere would be
completely incompatible

1903
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:37,150
with -- with anything that
I've said in ---

1904
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,550
I assumed, I just
wanted to make sure

1905
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:41,850
you don't believe
in any god anywhere.

1906
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:45,050
- No.
- What if after you died,
you ran into God.

1907
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:47,250
He said, "What have
you been doing, Richard?

1908
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,650
I mean,
what have you been doing?

1909
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:50,150
I've been trying to be nice to you.

1910
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:53,150
I gave you a multimillion-dollar
paycheck,

1911
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,150
over and over again
with your book,

1912
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,750
and look what you did."

1913
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,050
Bertrand Russell
had that point put to him,

1914
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:01,550
and he said something like,

1915
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:06,050
"Sir, why did you take such
pains to hide yourself?"

1916
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:12,050
<i>But if the Intelligent Design
people are right,</i>

1917
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,850
<i>God isn't hidden.</i>

1918
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,350
<i>We may even be able to
encounter God through science</i>

1919
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:20,550
<i>if we have the freedom
to go there.</i>

1920
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,050
<i>What could be
more intriguing than that?</i>

1921
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,550
We take freedom for granted

1922
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:32,650
Here in the United States.

1923
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,450
Freedom is what this country
is all about.

1924
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:40,850
And a huge part of freedom
is freedom of inquiry.

1925
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,950
But now, I'm sorry to say,

1926
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,550
freedom of inquiry in science
is being suppressed.

1927
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:48,950
Behind me stands a wall

1928
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:52,550
that encircles
the free sectors of this city,

1929
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:55,950
Part of a vast system of barriers.

1930
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:57,350
There are people out there

1931
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,450
who want to keep science
in a little box

1932
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,650
where it can't possibly touch
a higher power,

1933
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:05,150
cannot possibly touch God.

1934
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,050
Those barriers cut across Germany

1935
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,050
in a gash of barbed wire,

1936
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:13,550
concrete, dog runs,
and guard towers.

1937
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,050
If you believe in God,

1938
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,550
and you believe that there is

1939
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,350
an intrinsic order
in the universe,

1940
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,550
and you believe that
it's the role of science

1941
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:23,550
to try to pursue and
understand better that order,

1942
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:26,050
you will be ostracized.

1943
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:28,450
I'm frightened by this,

1944
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,050
but I'm not going to let it
stop me

1945
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,950
from investigating or
from speaking.

1946
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:36,150
The wall cannot withstand freedom.

1947
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,950
What I'm asking for is the freedom

1948
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:41,450
to follow the evidence
wherever it leads.

1949
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:44,950
My hope is that
there'll be enough

1950
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:46,550
independent-thinking scientists

1951
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,250
who don't like to be told
what to think.

1952
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,450
People on both sides
of the argument

1953
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:54,450
being prepared to talk and listen,

1954
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:56,350
and, above all, a willingness

1955
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,250
to keep these dialogues open.

1956
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,950
It might allow a lot of
very-good scientists

1957
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,450
to be scientists,

1958
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,850
who aren't allowed
to be scientists right now.

1959
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,250
I don't care what they
end up as being.

1960
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,350
I don't care if they
end up being religious

1961
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:12,450
or young-earth creationists.

1962
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:14,050
If they have thought their way

1963
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,950
through the issues and get there,

1964
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:17,850
I'm all for them.

1965
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:20,450
And why do I think
we're going to win
in this struggle?

1966
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,350
Because truth crushed
to Earth will rise again.

1967
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,250
To find out what's true
has a value all of its own.

1968
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,950
If it has additional
good consequences, so be it.

1969
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:32,350
Because no lie can live forever.

1970
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,250
I believe that science gives us
one perspective on the world,

1971
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:38,150
and our religious insight
gives us another perspective
on the world.

1972
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:39,650
By putting the two together,

1973
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,350
then we'll see
more deeply and more truly.

1974
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,750
And if we will stand up
for freedom...

1975
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,450
freedom is the victor.

1976
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:50,750
If we all do that,
we will overcome.

1977
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:12,150
<i>I've taken a first step</i>

1978
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:14,350
<i>by speaking out
on this issue.</i>

1979
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,250
<i>But if the wall
is to come down,</i>

1980
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,050
<i>we all have to do our part.</i>

1981
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,050
<i>Some of you
will pay a heavy price
for speaking out.</i>

1982
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:23,050
<i>You may even lose your job.</i>

1983
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:26,050
<i>I guarantee you
you'll get hate e-mail.</i>

1984
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:28,250
<i>But if you don't
get involved,</i>

1985
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:31,950
<i>will anyone be left
to carry on the struggle?</i>

1986
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,050
<i>Anyone?</i>

1987
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:34,150
<i>Anyone?</i>

1988
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,093
