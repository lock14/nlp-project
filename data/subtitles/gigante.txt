2
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,556
Jarita.

3
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,205
- Hi, Omar.
- How are you?

4
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,301
- Doing well?
- Yes.

5
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,144
Hi.

6
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,049
Jara, how are you?

7
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,683
What time is it?

8
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,252
10:57 PM.

9
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,341
Did that hurt?

10
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,610
- A bit.
- Screw you.

11
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,992
- Did you sign the petition?
- Not yet.

12
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,463
Not yet...

13
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:14,731
Get with it, eh?

14
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:23,306
"THlS lS THE lMAGE
CUSTOMERS HAVE OF ME"

15
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,653
Hi.

16
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,191
- It's 11:00 already?
- Hi.

17
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,930
I left you a couple of pastries
in the bag.

18
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:28,674
Stop eating on the desk
with the monitor, use the table.

19
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,006
Okay... I'm going.

20
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,110
Be good. See you later.

21
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,268
They move like this.

22
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,711
Clockwise, see?

23
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,975
That's how they move.

24
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,669
So, how goes it?

25
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:41,540
What?

26
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:45,103
- What do you mean, what?
- It's an expression.

27
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,429
Monotheism.

28
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,470
- How you doing, Fidel?
- Shitty.

29
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,055
The menstrual flow
is a vaginal discharge,

30
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:21,460
which are very common,
most women have them.

31
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,761
There's different types
of discharges.

32
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,826
There's the normal menstrual flow
we all have each month...

33
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:39,140
It was around here, wait.

34
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,984
Now you're gonna see something.

35
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,783
There it is, look.

36
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,290
What do you say?

37
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,554
Let me get a close-up.

38
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,858
There you go.

39
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,096
I'm losing it.

40
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,101
Please.

41
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,262
Unbelievable.

42
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,340
Here you go, Kennedy.

43
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,384
Well...

44
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,814
Tell Rojas he's wanted
on the loading dock.

45
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,349
Thanks.

46
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,886
Mr. Rojas, you're wanted
on the loading dock.

47
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:16,030
Look me in the eye when I talk to you.
If it happens again, you're fired.

48
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:30,237
- See you Monday.
- See you Monday.

49
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,338
Coming.

50
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,489
I had to wait 45 minutes to be served.
I can't believe no one is there at noon.

51
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,890
And there was no one around
to settle the check.

52
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,554
It's stuffy in here.

53
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:19,340
I got chicken and potato salad,
there was no pickled tongue.

54
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,621
- Look, Uncle.
- Good.

55
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,254
Don't just stay inside
playing that game.

56
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,322
Tell him, no homework, no game.

57
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,631
She says no homework, no game.

58
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:44,303
Tell her I'll do it.

59
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,339
He'll do it.

60
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:51,471
- Did you buy bread?
- No, I didn't, here.

61
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,037
It's okay.

62
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,481
- Take it.
- I've got money.

63
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,816
- Here, take the money.
- Forget it.

64
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,955
Goal! Goal!

65
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:09,256
Didn't see it, eh?
C'mon, start.

66
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,105
I'm getting it in.

67
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,674
It hit the post.

68
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,376
Cocksucker!

69
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,911
- Come here!
- Easy, Pablo

70
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,571
- Easy, Pablo.
- Motherfucker!

71
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,012
Easy, Pablo.

72
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:04,680
Pablo, Pablo...

73
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,788
Hey, that's enough.

74
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,917
Are you okay?

75
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:11,982
Are you okay?

76
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,696
Easy now.

77
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,130
- Pablo, stop it. Please...
- Son of a bitch!

78
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:20,962
Son of a bitch!

79
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,501
- Can you hear okay?
- Yeah.

80
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:34,675
- Should we take you to the hospital?
- No, I'm okay.

81
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,843
Here's your money.

82
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,411
- And a bit more, it was busy.
- Okay, thanks.

83
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:47,090
Can we speed it up?
It's 7:30 AM.

84
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,329
What kind of pillow do you have?

85
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,528
I don't know, a pillow.

86
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:05,870
- What's it made of?
- I don't know, Omar. The usual.

87
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:11,536
Turn to your right
and look at your shoulder.

88
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,640
The other side.

89
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,583
- It feels tight?
- Yeah. Right there.

90
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,817
It's the trapezius.

91
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,518
I don't know.

92
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,764
- Better?
- Yeah, fantastic.

93
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,441
Jarita,
where'd you learn to do that?

94
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,241
On TV.

95
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:29,167
That's 16 pesos.

96
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,314
- Got change?
- No.

97
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,290
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

98
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:44,985
Excuse me.

99
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,252
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,626
- A machine?
- Yeah.

101
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,530
Take number 30, in the back.

102
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,999
Thanks.

103
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,781
Sorry.

104
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:52,954
Excuse me.

105
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,181
- Is this number 22?
- Yes.

106
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:23,622
- They said it was free.
- Yes, it is.

107
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,786
- Thanks.
- Sorry about that.

108
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,631
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

109
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,232
May l?

110
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,207
ALL KNlTTlNG

111
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,940
- Is this the latest?
- Yes.

112
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:56,678
I have the previous one, too.

113
00:28:56,752 --> 00:29:00,153
- No, don't bother.
- It's no trouble.

114
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,880
Let me see.

115
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:09,461
Here it is.

116
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,331
This is the previous one.

117
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,039
- If you want back issues...
- Thanks.

118
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:22,042
- I can get them in three or four days.
- Thanks, but...

119
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,045
I can get the first few issues.
It's more complicated,

120
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:30,449
but give me eight to 10 days,
and your phone number,

121
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,953
I'll call you when I get them.

122
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,285
No, it's fine, really.

123
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,486
The pin comes up to here,

124
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:52,158
so the pulley can work
on this side.

125
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,330
Excuse me.

126
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,530
Isn't it this long?

127
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,369
And this high?

128
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:06,145
Jara, hold your arm out a minute.

129
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,877
Here, like this, at this angle,

130
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,476
it rotates like this, see?

131
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:14,112
No, no.

132
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:18,057
If it's not straight,
it doesn't work.

133
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,698
Yes, it works.

134
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:29,168
It turns on its own axis.

135
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:32,331
What's up?

136
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,773
They don't like
the petition upstairs.

137
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:37,471
We'll have to have an assembly.

138
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:39,605
Did you ask for my permission?

139
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,808
No, I didn't.

140
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,408
Asshole.

141
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,216
How you doing?

142
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,258
What a jerk.

143
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:09,302
- Come here.
- Me?

144
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:10,429
Yes.

145
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:14,801
What?

146
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:18,403
You know what.
Go put it back.

147
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,471
- What?
- Keep your voice down.

148
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,277
I'm doing you a favor.
Keep it down.

149
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,339
Okay.

150
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:33,124
Some pasta or rice, go ahead.
But not this.

151
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,321
Yeah, okay.

152
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,216
I don't want any trouble,
get going.

153
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,217
It won't happen again...

154
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,445
Move it.

155
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,392
Hi.

156
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,663
Fucking kid!

157
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,870
- Big guy.
- Hi.

158
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,777
- You all right?
- Everything's fine.

159
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,347
- Did you see the game?
- No.

160
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:30,956
The country girl is hot, eh?

161
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:37,662
I've caught her stealing yogurt
a couple times.

162
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,463
Excuse me.

163
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,607
With that ass you don't need a pussy.

164
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:45,703
I'll split you in eight like a pizza.

165
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,688
- Hello.
- Big guy.

166
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:11,189
- So?
- Things are getting nasty, Jarita.

167
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,630
There'll be trouble.

168
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:18,033
- Got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

169
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,630
You can't smoke here.

170
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,246
What do I care,
they'll fire me anyway.

171
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,518
- Why do you follow her?
- None of your business.

172
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,702
Let's go play PlayStation.

173
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,897
Stop bugging me.

174
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:55,935
Come on,
let's go home.

175
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,916
- Come on.
- I already told you.

176
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:10,146
- Come on, let's go.
- In a bit.

177
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,784
- Why?
- Just wait.

178
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,385
I don't want to.

179
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,364
Well, you have to.

180
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,946
Let's go!

181
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:46,884
Stop goofing around.
Move it!

182
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:49,327
- Go to hell!
- Move it!

183
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:21,023
- Go get that.
- I don't want to.

184
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:27,431
- Go get that, brat.
- I don't want to.

185
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:31,828
- Go to hell.
- You go to hell.

186
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,973
- Hello.
- Hello.

187
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,914
Come on, Matías.

188
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:49,085
Come on, Matías.

189
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,488
- Come on, move it.
- Let go!

190
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:20,944
Stamp.

191
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:26,052
Did you get a stamp?
Get one.

192
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,764
- Hi, how you doing?
- Good.

193
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:43,606
Great. Look, we have 100 pesos,
can we both get in?

194
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:45,144
- No.
- No?

195
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:48,579
Move aside a bit. Stamp?

196
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:53,482
Okay, well...

197
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:56,955
we only have enough money
to buy drinks.

198
00:47:57,024 --> 00:48:00,289
- Sure, but the cover is 80.
- Yeah...

199
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:04,798
I know it's 80,
but is there any chance?

200
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,857
Can I go out for a smoke?

201
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,562
- No.
- No?

202
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:17,310
There's no way
to work something out?

203
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:19,243
- No, no way.
- No?

204
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,110
Look...
Move aside a bit.

205
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:23,309
- 140 for both.
- 140 for both?

206
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:24,408
Yes, 140.

207
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,215
I'll talk with her and
maybe we'll come back.

208
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:28,346
Okay.

209
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,287
Stamp?

210
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:45,632
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

211
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:47,674
- Can you get by?
- Yeah.

212
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,333
Move it over a bit.

213
00:49:03,057 --> 00:49:04,251
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,925
- Playing soccer tomorrow?
- No, I can't.

215
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,158
Can you pass the salt, Jara?

216
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,195
Can you put it down?

217
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:52,296
It's bad luck if you hand it to me.

218
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,806
Thanks.

219
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,198
- Hello.
- Hello.

220
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:05,768
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks, just looking.

221
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,043
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

222
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:54,415
Bummer.
What the hell happened, Jara?

223
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:59,050
- I'll take care of it.
- And where was l, sleeping?

224
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:02,357
Hang on. I'll wash my face
and we'll figure it out.

225
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:23,941
I have no choice,
I have to suspend you.

226
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:33,718
There's a bathroom
in the control room, Jara.

227
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:27,093
Yes?

228
01:01:28,234 --> 01:01:32,364
A pizza, mozzarella
and a fainá. And a beer.

229
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,781
No! No!

230
01:03:32,859 --> 01:03:36,556
That wasn't a foul.
And now they yellow card him!

231
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:39,120
Larrionda is full of shit.

232
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:46,462
He's pissed off.

233
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:49,732
What a bastard.

234
01:03:55,482 --> 01:03:56,972
It's no use.

235
01:03:58,518 --> 01:04:00,850
Totally one-sided.

236
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:19,647
- Hey man, got any money?
- Huh?

237
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:22,620
- Just a coin.
- I have nothing.

238
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:24,520
Seriously.

239
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:27,457
I just came from work,
I don't have money.

240
01:07:27,527 --> 01:07:28,653
Just a little money, man.

241
01:07:28,728 --> 01:07:31,697
- Seriously. I don't have anything.
- Give us some money, man.

242
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,733
- Some money, I said.
- I just came from work.

243
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,202
Don't touch me,
I have nothing.

244
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,940
Take my cell phone.
Leave me alone.

245
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:46,569
- That's it.
- Give me some money.

246
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,637
Here, that's it.
Leave me alone.

247
01:07:54,587 --> 01:07:57,750
Are you sure you don't want
to get your hand checked?

248
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,089
No, it's fine.
Really.

249
01:08:10,436 --> 01:08:12,563
Where did you meet that girl?

250
01:08:12,638 --> 01:08:16,335
Julia? Chatting, on the internet.

251
01:08:19,278 --> 01:08:21,508
- Who won this game?
- No idea.

252
01:08:21,581 --> 01:08:23,811
- Progreso won.
- Progreso, really?

253
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:26,876
Will you meet Julia again?

254
01:08:26,953 --> 01:08:29,547
Rampla got robbed
three penalty kicks.

255
01:08:29,622 --> 01:08:33,080
- Three penalty kicks?
- Yeah, they screwed them again.

256
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,160
What a rip-off.

257
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:45,202
I'm starving...

258
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:50,734
I didn't eat dinner.

259
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:55,342
This first date stuff makes me nervous.

260
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:58,248
Maybe it doesn't show, but...

261
01:08:58,317 --> 01:08:59,944
I don't know...

262
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:02,749
- Have you ever done it?
- No.

263
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:06,053
I don't recommend it.

264
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:09,094
You imagine what it will be like,

265
01:09:09,162 --> 01:09:11,426
and so does the other person.

266
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:14,591
You build it up,

267
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:18,103
and when you meet
it's totally different.

268
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:22,130
I was nervous all day.
I could barely work.

269
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:26,508
It's not the first time.
I've tried before,

270
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,070
and I can't get used to it.

271
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:31,639
I just can't.

272
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:34,277
Are you going out again?

273
01:09:34,353 --> 01:09:38,084
Probably not.
I don't think she liked me.

274
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:41,820
They're looking
for someone perfect...

275
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:44,227
Are you sure?

276
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:49,132
- About what?
- That she didn't like you.

277
01:09:49,202 --> 01:09:50,601
Yeah.

278
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,764
Maybe she's not my type either.

279
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,138
Why not?

280
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,234
She's kind of...

281
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:01,303
kind of weird, strange, you know?

282
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,308
She likes the beaches here.

283
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:08,785
Here, in Montevideo.

284
01:10:08,855 --> 01:10:11,756
Now if you said Lagomar, Solymar...

285
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:16,090
Maybe because she's from the country.
Beaches here suck.

286
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:18,528
She's strange how?

287
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:23,035
From the little time we spent together,
she seems to be kind of...

288
01:10:23,102 --> 01:10:27,061
she likes heavy metal bands.

289
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,472
Which bands?

290
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,942
Like Guns n' Roses...

291
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:34,605
She mentioned a Metallica CD...

292
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:38,639
I'm not against any kind of music,

293
01:10:38,718 --> 01:10:40,879
I listen to everything, but...

294
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:43,786
heavy metal kind of gets on my nerves.

295
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:46,916
I'm going to the washroom,
be right back.

296
01:11:47,353 --> 01:11:49,947
- Thanks, have a good day.
- Thanks.

297
01:11:50,022 --> 01:11:51,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

298
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:55,526
18 pesos.

299
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,086
Thanks.

300
01:12:04,804 --> 01:12:06,328
SMlLE,
WE'RE FlLMlNG.

301
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:14,637
Pretty smile.

302
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:16,011
Have a nice day.

303
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,613
- Hello.
- Hi.

304
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:16,731
...OUR CO-WORKERS

305
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:34,320
We have to call to try to get more food.
Hey, Big guy.

306
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:37,294
They fired eight people, Jara,
what a disaster.

307
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:41,231
- Want me to call?
- Could you send a text message?

308
01:13:52,611 --> 01:13:54,135
Coming!

309
01:13:57,149 --> 01:13:59,049
- Jarita...
- Open up.

310
01:14:21,574 --> 01:14:23,235
Jara...

311
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:43,922
Hey! You take a holiday
and all hell breaks loose, eh?

312
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:52,935
They fired four from the warehouse
and one cleaner.

313
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:23,092
What are you doing?

314
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,598
What's with him?

315
01:15:27,873 --> 01:15:29,636
Danilo, do you copy?

316
01:15:44,056 --> 01:15:45,751
Hi.

317
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:39,406
What are you doing?

318
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,829
Stop, stop.

319
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,068
Stop, Jara!

320
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:11,405
- Big guy, listen.
- Stop it, kid.

321
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:13,945
- You'll get yourself fired.
- That's enough.

322
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,247
- God damn it!
- You'll get yourself fired.

323
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:20,717
Easy, kid, easy.

324
01:17:21,754 --> 01:17:23,984
Easy, kid, easy.

325
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,651
- Calm down.
- Take it easy.

326
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,695
- Calm down.
- Come here.

327
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,628
Stop, stop!

328
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,168
- Stop, damn it. Stop!
- ldiot.

329
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,261
- Stop, stop!
- Calm down.

330
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,967
- That's enough.
- Easy, it's okay.

331
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,706
What the hell
were you thinking?

332
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:57,822
How long do you think
I can put up with your shit?

333
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,016
So?

334
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,389
He said to wait
until Jara leaves.

335
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,951
First of all, do you have a brain?

336
01:18:04,029 --> 01:18:06,054
You don't have a damn thing.

337
01:18:06,131 --> 01:18:10,932
If you want to smash things,
smash your head against the wall.

338
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:14,734
You think I can put up with this?
It's enough.

339
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:17,708
You understand?
Answer me.

340
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:32,754
Hey, man... it's the final stop.

341
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:35,814
- Yes?
- Hello.

342
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,584
I'm looking for Julia, please.

343
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:42,627
Julia's not here.

344
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,890
- Are you from work?
- Yes.

345
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:54,938
- Did you get fired too?
- Yes.

346
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:58,238
- Julia went to the beach.
- Ah, okay.

347
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:02,508
Tell her I got her
unemployment insurance arranged.

348
01:20:02,581 --> 01:20:05,209
Sure, I'll tell her.

349
01:20:05,284 --> 01:20:06,945
Thanks.

350
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:08,213
- Bye.
- Bye.

351
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:05,266
Julia?

352
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:08,198
Hi.
