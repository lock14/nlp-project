1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:02,588
Welcome back
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:03,563
to the big game.

3
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:04,464
This is it!

4
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,137
50 million viewers
all chasing up on.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,180
Perhaps the

6
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:11,167
greatest football player
of all time.

7
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,710
We are now
in the final moments

8
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:15,206
of this historic game.

9
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,001
Seconds on the clock,
this is it.

10
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,422
This is for the gold!

11
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,106
The arena sold out

12
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,472
and a 100.000 strong.

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,005
But the big question
remains calm.

14
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,860
Are they putting the kid in?

15
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:33,536
Now! He is!

16
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:35,822
Oh trouble right there!

17
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:36,713
Trouble right there!

18
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:37,423
Trouble again.

19
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:38,634
He is right on the edge.

20
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:39,988
He is all over the field.

21
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,159
Look at the speed!

22
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:45,069
The yellow defences is really
going to have come on strong.

23
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:46,834
And here is
another challenge on the way.

24
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:51,062
But even
under such pressure

25
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,505
this kid has the tendency

26
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:53,960
to really come on
strong enough

27
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:55,645
in the final moments
of any game.

28
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,925
Believe me
he is only in the disaster.

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,470
Exploding through the defence!

30
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,371
Oh!
The kid almost went down!

31
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:09,950
He almost went downgrade.

32
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,316
Defender going crazy!

33
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,796
He is carrying
a lot of speed

34
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:16,684
across that field.

35
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:17,345
Down!

36
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:18,157
Look out!

37
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:18,913
He is in trouble!

38
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:20,023
He is in trouble!

39
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,227
That's a fair ref there!

40
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,501
This ref is as cool as

41
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:29,337
Hannibal Lecter.

42
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:35,591
Oh...
look at that.

43
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:37,022
It is a penalty kick!

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,074

45
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:49,280
This is it!

46
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,686
It's all come down
to this one shot.

47
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,175
I would not want to be
under the pressure

48
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,516
this kid is
experiencing right now.

49
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,166
This is for the gold.

50
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,960
He is waiting.

51
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,115
And there... she is.

52
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,487
One of the most feared
goalies on the world's stand.

53
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,933
With an unprecedented
63 gold medals under her belt,

54
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,558
and 39 World Cup titles.

55
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,595
There is not
a more experienced

56
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,806
and respected goalie
on a planet.

57
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,559
And here is the kick!

58
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,468
GOAL!

59
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:50,388
He is done it!

60
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,006
He is done it
and he has gold!

61
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,492
We have just witnessed
the impossible.

62
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,858
He is taken the gold.

63
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:56,789
Pandemonium!

64
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:59,831
Pandemonium,
the crowd is gone ballistic.

65
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:00,834
Unbelievable!

66
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,674
Unbelievable!
They are taken home

67
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:03,397
the World Cup.

68
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:04,674
You have just witnessed

69
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,625
the single greatest moment
this sport has ever seen.

70
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,432
Just incredible!
But he is done it!

71
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,408
He has done it!

72
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,495
He has done the unthinkable!

73
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:20,732
Singlehandedly,

74
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,414
this kid has won
perhaps the greatest game

75
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,062
ever played and axed his name
into the history books.

76
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:26,963
Incredible!

77
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,917
Never and I mean never have I ever
witnessed such a performance.

78
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,305
This kid will go down
as perhaps the greatest.

79
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,775
And I mean the greatest
ever to play the game.

80
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:36,676
Johan Cruyff,

81
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:37,790
George Best,

82
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,741
Pele, Messi,
Ronaldo, Rooney.

83
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,209
We are moving over
gentlemen because there is

84
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,380
a new kid in town.

85
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:44,984
One can only imagine,

86
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:46,284
the endorsements,

87
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:47,328
all that bubblegum,

88
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,304
all that candy.

89
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,429
No more curfews.

90
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,160
This man can write his own
check at this:

91
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,303
his everybody’s Christmas.

92
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,889
Everybody’s Disneyland.

93
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,254
Sundays without care.

94
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:00,759
This boy has done
the absolute unthinkable!

95
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,528
There is not
a team on the planet

96
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,479
that will not pay very dearly

97
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,326
for the talents, the skill,

98
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,594
the shear genius
of this young man.

99
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,319
Finally the money
for a new bicycle.

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,475
He won’t have to go
to bed at 9 p.m.

101
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,206
You still have to mow the lawn,

102
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,157
but it will be in solid gold!

103
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:20,827
He is big and ugly

104
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:21,917
and get probably

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,459
in a child's house
through a wicker chair.

106
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,360
The End

107
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,361
