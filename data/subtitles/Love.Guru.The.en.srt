00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,480
<i>When I was a child in India,</i>

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,240
<i>growing up in the tiny village
of Harenmahkeester,</i>

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,320
<i>I found a voice-over machine,</i>

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,320
<i>which I still use to this day.</i>

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,520
Oh, hi.

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,160
I decided to use
the Morgan Freeman setting.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
I am His Holiness the Guru Pitka.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,160
<i>In my book, If You're Happy
and You Know it, Think Again,</i>

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,960
I speak of intimacy, or "into-me-l-see."

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Intimacy is like putting your wiener
on the table and having someone say,

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
"That looks like a penis, only smaller."

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
Only smaller.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,080
Though I was raised here in India,
I was born in America,

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,080
which is where our journey begins.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,480
It's the story of a hockey player
named Darren Roanoke,

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,280
my most resistant student,
who became my greatest teacher.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,560
Or some such bullshit. I don't know.
Gotta go!

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,560
- Hi, I'm Trent Lueders!
- And I'm Jay Kell.

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,840
Tonight is all about champions.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,880
But before we get going,

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'd like to start by thanking
my own personal champions.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,200
The fans who supported me
with their cards and letters

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,640
during my recent addiction
to peyote buttons and Frangelico.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,120
I've already apologized to my friends,
my family, and my god.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,880
And now, I'd like to apologize
to Dame Judi Dench

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,360
for my vicious and brutal attack.

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm sorry, Judi, you did not deserve that,
and I hope the staples come out soon.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Over to you, Trent.

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,760
Thanks, Jay!

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,880
Tonight, the Toronto Maple Leafs'
Darren Roanoke

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,520
<i>is the subject of our player profile.</i>

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,280
Hockey has its legends.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,560
Now, the new one, Darren Roanoke.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Known as the Tiger Woods of hockey,

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,360
Roanoke brought the sport
to a whole new audience.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,600
- Hey, yo, check this, son!
- Check this!

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,560
<i>A role model turned bad boy.</i>

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>He was in a perfect marriage.</i>

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
<i>But before the playoffs,</i>

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>he stunned the world
by separating from his wife, Prudence.</i>

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,800
From role model to dating models.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
Roanoke found out his wife, Prudence,

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
<i>was dating the L.A. Kings' legendary</i>

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,040
<i>French-Canadian goalie,
Jacques "Le Coq" Grande.</i>

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,760
He earned his nickname, "Le Coq,"

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,600
for reasons that cannot be stated
on this program.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,160
This interview is over.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,880
Holy...

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>That's when Roanoke fell apart.</i>

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,440
<i>Roanoke is hit hard.
Open net! He misses!</i>

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Damn, damn, damn!

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,640
But the question on everyone's mind is,
can the Leafs win without Roanoke?

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
Well, can we win the Cup
without Roanoke?

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,960
Not a chance, boss.

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
As long as Jacques "Le Coq" Grande
is banging Darren's wife,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
Darren's toast.

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,960
My father once told me the Yankees
hired a guru to turn their team around.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,120
I have our guru.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
If he can fix Darren, we win the Cup.

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,760
They call him the Love Guru.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,520
<i>Tumble out of bed
and I stumble to the kitchen</i>

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,600
<i>Pour myself a cup of ambition</i>

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
<i>Yawning, stretching, try to come to life</i>

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>Jump in the shower
and the blood starts pumping</i>

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,240
<i>Out on the streets
the traffic starts jumping</i>

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,320
<i>With folks like me on the job
from 9:00 to 5:00</i>

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,600
<i>Working 9:00 to 5:00</i>

68
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>What a way to make a living</i>

69
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,280
<i>Barely getting by
it's all taking and no giving</i>

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,680
<i>They just use your mind
and they never give you credit</i>

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,600
<i>It's enough to drive you crazy
if you let it</i>

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
<i>They let your dream
just to watch them shatter</i>

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,560
<i>You're just a step
on the boss man's ladder</i>

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,080
<i>But you've got dreams
he'll never take away</i>

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>You're in the same boat
with a lot of your friends</i>

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,400
<i>Waiting for the day
your ship will come in</i>

77
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,680
<i>And the tide's gonna turn
and it's all gonna roll your way</i>

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,120
<i>Working 9:00 to 5:00
for service and devotion</i>

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,480
<i>You would think that I
would deserve a fair promotion</i>

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,920
<i>Want to move ahead
but the boss won't seem to let me</i>

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,360
<i>I swear sometimes
that man is out to get me</i>

82
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
<i>Working 9:00 to 5:00</i>

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,760

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
Here we go, here we go.

94
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,440
Mariska Hargitay, Speedy. Yeah.

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,280
Ride 'em, cowboy.

96
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,480
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

97
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Rajneesh! Mariska Hargitay.

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,840
Your manager Richard Pants is here.

99
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,000
Dick Pants. Send him in.

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,880
Have you seen today's paper?

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, don't tell me,

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
it's another article about
Deepak Chopra being number one

104
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
and me being number two?

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,840
Not in as many words.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,440
Quaking pudding! I can't take this!

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Not again! What? Why, why?

108
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,840
<i>Babu, to be the world's second
most popular</i>

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Neo-Eastern-Self-Help-Spiritualist
is no small thing.

110
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,840
Thank you, Rajneesh.
You are my compass.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Give me a pound.

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,040
Lock it down.

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Break the pickle.

114
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Tickle, tickle.

115
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
- You!
- You!

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
- Well, no, you!
- You!

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,760
No, no, no! You!

118
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,320
Okay. You!

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
No! You!

120
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
Stop it!

121
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,280
Who's the gift basket from, Dick?

122
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Brad and Angelina.

123
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,920
It says,
"Thank you for the gift of true intimacy,

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,160
"but we've decided
to work with Deepak instead."

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,760
What does Deepak Chopra have
that I don't have?

126
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,760
<i>He's been on Oprah.</i>

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,120
<i>Oprah!</i>

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,880
And Oprah loves a great story.
Now, take a look at this.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
The Toronto Maple Leafs
will pay you $2 million,

130
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,720
if you can get Darren Roanoke
back with his wife

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,560
in time to win the Stanley Cup.

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Two million dollars!

133
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
That's a lot of cheese.

134
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,360
But wait, it gets better!

135
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
I spoke to Oprah's producers,

136
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,200
and if you can restore
Darren Roanoke's marriage,

137
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,160
they guarantee
that you will be on her show!

138
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,680
Let me get this straight.

139
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,640
<i>If I fix their marriage, I get on Oprah,</i>

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,960
<i>and if I get on Oprah,
I'm the next Deepak Chopra!</i>

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,400
Deepak Chopra. Maurice Pitka.

142
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,640
Please enter the ashram
of the Guru Tugginmypudha.

143
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,600
Guru Tugginmypudha,
you are so good with nunchucks,

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
yet you are blind.

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
I am not blind.

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,400
I am just severely cross-eyed.

147
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,400
I know, it is weird.

148
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
Be seated.

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,320
Deepak, here you go.

150
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,760
Maurice, you're not of Indian blood.

151
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
Speak of your parents.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,480
They are both dead.
They were missionaries.

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,960
And what did they do before then?

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,240
They were dog stylists.

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
So, let me get this straight.

156
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,640
They were into doggy style
before the missionary position?

157
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
That's hilarious.
My parents are dead. Thanks.

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
Deepak,

159
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,000
why do you want to join
the Tugginmypudha Ashram?

160
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,880
To seek my true self.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
All right, kiss ass.

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,240
Maurice, why do you want to join?

163
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I want to become a guru
so girls will like me.

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
Then I will like myself.

165
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Deepak, you will enjoy love in all forms.

166
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,160
Maurice, you must
wear this chastity belt.

167
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,080
Chastity belt? That sucks!

168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
Once you have learned

169
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,720
that self-love is more important
than being loved by others,

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
you may remove the belt.

171
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,320
Master, if I am not allowed
to be with a woman, may I still...

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
You will go cross-eyed!

173
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,400
Guaranteed.

174
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,640
- Mariska Hargitay. Yeah.
- Mariska Hargitay.

175
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,280
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

176
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,960
Welcome to my ashram,

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
the Ecumenical Intuitive Enlightenment
Initiative Organization,

178
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,200
or EIEIO.

179
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,200
- Guru Pitka had a farm.
- EIEIO.

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,800
- And on that farm, he did no harm.
- EIEIO.

181
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,160
Okay.

182
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,680
If I sit like this any longer,
I'm gonna pop my dink bag.

183
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,000
Listen up. I am a guru.

184
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,240
Let's look at the word "guru," okay?

185
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,760
My goal is to get you to say,
"Gee, you are you."

186
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,640
TM.

187
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,880
And the you of "guru" is intimacy.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
Or "into-me-l-see."

189
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
I see.

190
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,840
Without intimacy, you feel nowhere.

191
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,440
Tonight I want you to go
from nowhere to "now here."

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah.

193
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
<i>It's like in The Electric Company,
you know?</i>

194
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,400
- Now...
- Here.

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,680
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere.

196
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,240
My laws of intimacy
are kind of like my Bible.

197
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,120
And let's look at the word "Bible,"
shall we?

198
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,040
The Bible is " basic instructions
before leaving earth."

199
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,120
TM.

200
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,200
Put that shit on a T-shirt.

201
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
Show the T-shirt.

202
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,640
Now, I myself
have a guru, Guru Tugginmypudha.

203
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,080
And my guru, Guru Tugginmypudha
had a guru, Guru Cheddafrumunda.

204
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,720
And Guru Cheddafrumunda
had a guru, Guru Hathasmalvena.

205
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
Guru Hathasmalvena had
two main periods of his Gita,

206
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,480
or words of wisdom.

207
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,960
The first period
came before he got syphilis.

208
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,080
Some pre-syphilitic
words of wisdom include,

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,520
"To know something is good.

210
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,680
"To do something is God."

211
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,080
Then, after he got syphilis,
he would say things like,

212
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,400
"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

213
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,080
"Did it smell that bad when you ate it?"

214
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,440
"Liquor up front, poker in back."

215
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,680
But his point was this,

216
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,880
"If you can't love yourself,
you can't love another."

217
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,800
And that's the end of that one. Yeah.

218
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,120
Mariska Hargitay.

219
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,440
Some announcements.

220
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,000
On Friday, please join us

221
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,560
for our first annual Gamblers
Anonymous Monte Carlo Night.

222
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,320
Yeah. Just for funzies, you know.
Bring your singles. Yeah.

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,000
All right, good night, everyone! Yeah!

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
Thank you so much!

225
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
Great show, Guru Pitka.

226
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,080
Hey, any bears in the cave?

227
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,440
- Any bears?
- Oh, yeah.

228
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
Bear cub. Left cave.

229
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,960
- Right here?
- There. Right there.

230
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,040
Yeah. Right.

231
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,600
That little booger gave me a
nose-whistle during the whole show.

232
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Now, I'm ready to receive.

233
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,320
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

234
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,800
Mariska Hargitay, Jessica Simpson.

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
Did you get into the VIP room okay?

236
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,080
I love you.

237
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,560
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,760
Mariska Hargitay, Val Kilmer.

239
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
Why do you hurt me?

240
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
I know why. I know why.

241
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,600
- Mariska Hargitay, Guru Pitka.
- Mariska Hargitay...

242
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,440
Mariska Hargitay.

243
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,240
I so enjoyed your sutra,

244
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,320
especially the part
about not being a victim.

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
Well, thank you.

246
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,640
Because you are such
a generous benefactor,

247
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,520
we are establishing the
"Mariska Hargitay Special Victims Unit."

248
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,200
The whole nine yards.

249
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,040
Thank you, Your Holiness.

250
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,120
You have gone
from nowhere to now here.

251
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm beautiful and I have a secret.

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,920
Bang.

253
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Yes.

254
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,640
Guru Pitka, this is Jane Bullard,
owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

255
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,080
<i>- Guru Pitka?
- Hold on one second.</i>

256
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,920
<i>Guru Pitka?</i>

257
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,520
No!

258
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
So, you are the owner
of the ice hockey team,

259
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,240
the Toronto Maple Leaves?

260
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,000
- Actually, it's Leafs.
- Who said that?

261
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,840
How did you get there?

262
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,720
This little guy
scared the crap out of me.

263
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,080
I think I'm gonna have to do
a panty check.

264
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,920
I might have some
monkey-mustard back there.

265
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,520
No, I am good.

266
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Who is this prick?

267
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,280
Well, how do you do? Shrimp?

268
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,840
What'd you call me, Jagamo?

269
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your gnome... Name!

270
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
You are a midget.

271
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,000
I find that term condescending!

272
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
Condescending.
That's a big word for you.

273
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,200
The man's an ass!

274
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Your Holiness, you're an expert on love.

275
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Yes, I am.

276
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
Why do you think Darren Roanoke
threw away his marriage?

277
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,840
<i>Well, in my book,
I Know You Are, But What Am I?</i>

278
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,880
I explain that when love goes wrong...

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
- Nothing goes right.
...nothing goes right.

280
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,120
- Yes!
- I've read it. It's impressive.

281
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,560
Yeah, it's nothing short
of a masterpiece.

282
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,720
So, do you think you can come back
with us to Toronto in the team jet?

283
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,200
- It's a date.
- Is it, now?

284
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,880
Well, this kitten's got a whip. Meow!

285
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,200
This is great, Your Holiness!

286
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,520
I can see you now,
spreading your message of self-love

287
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
<i>- on Oprah.
- Oprah!</i>

288
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
<i>He's finally here for the first time
on the Oprah show.</i>

289
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,040
Welcome Guru Pitka.

290
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Oprah! Come on, Oprah.

291
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,040
Hello. Thank you very much.

292
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,880
Mariska Hargitay.
Thank you for the gift of water.

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,320
All right, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

294
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,960
I find your work really inspiring.

295
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,880
I actually went to one of your sutras
after my father passed away.

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

297
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,760
Have you read my book
on the grieving process?

298
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,040
<i>It's called, What's This?
A Dead One of These.</i>

299
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
- Yes.
- Oh, you have?

300
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,880
I especially like the chapter,
"It Might Just Be Sleeping."

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
My favorite.

302
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,120
- I've read all your books.
- Oh. Well.

303
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,880
To tell you the truth,
I kind of have a schoolgirl crush.

304
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,200
Oh, really?

305
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
What does your husband
think about this crush?

306
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm not married.

307
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,200
- Boyfriend?
- Nope.

308
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Girlfriend?

309
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,920
Well, I mean,
there was one time in college.

310
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,680
Really?

311
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,400
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

312
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,400
Well, it's hard to believe a girl like you
can't find a man.

313
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
What does that mean, "a girl like me"?

314
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, come on, I don't have words for it.

315
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,880
You know, nice girl, intelligent,

316
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,520
bedroom eyes, pouty lips, great rack,
tight bell-shaped ass,

317
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,800
thicker than a Snicker...

318
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,280
Say.

319
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,520
My problem with men
is the Bullard Curse.

320
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,320
What's a Bullard Curse?

321
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,440
My father, Hank Bullard,
bought the Leafs in 1967.

322
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,040
And we haven't
won a Stanley Cup since.

323
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,040
So, all the men in the city
blame me and my family.

324
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,640
<i>Well, as I write in my book
Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

325
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,560
<i>Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

326
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,240
<i>Why Are You Still Hitting Yourself?</i>

327
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,200
I explain that,
people may say bad things about you,

328
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,360
but you must never
say bad things about yourself.

329
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,960
I see someone who's ready for change.

330
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,920
It would just be easier to change,

331
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,520
if I didn't have to deal with the city
that hates me.

332
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,320
Jane, the City of Toronto
doesn't hate you.

333
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't.

334
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,840
- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't.

335
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Trust me.

336
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,880
At the arena,
I had Maintenance paint lines

337
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,360
to show me
where the crowd can't see me.

338
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,640
<i>You know, so they don't boo me
and throw stuff at my head.</i>

339
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,320
I mean, I didn't even ask for this job!
I guess it's just my fate!

340
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,960
Fate is a joke.

341
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,360
And as I once read on a wall,
in a truck stop bathroom in Barstow,

342
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
"The joke is in your hands."

343
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Oh, my God, I just got that!

344
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Well, to be more accurate,
the joke was in Rajneesh's hands.

345
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,680
What?

346
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Nice shooting!

347
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,200
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

348
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,840
Look, man,
just get back on your pillow, all right?

349
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,280
There ain't no connection
between my love life and my hockey.

350
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,960
I'm not here to work with you.

351
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,800
I just came by to say hello and goodbye.

352
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
- Goodbye?
- Yeah.

353
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,120
I spoke with your wife, Prudence.

354
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,160
She broke it off with Grande,
and now she wants you back!

355
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,080
- Seriously?
- Sure. You don't need me.

356
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,320
Go back to what you were doing.

357
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
Yes!

358
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,400
There is one other thing.

359
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,680
I lied.

360
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,160
Prudence is still with Jacques Grande,

361
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,160
and he still has
the biggest wiener in hockey.

362
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,280
- Is it true?
- Yes, he has a ginormous hog.

363
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
Do you still think there is no connection

364
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,440
between Prudence
and how crappy you are playing?

365
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Tell me this.

366
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,760
- Do you want Prudence back?
- Of course I do.

367
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,640
Then I need you
to write Prudence an apology letter,

368
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
and I will go deliver it to her.

369
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,240
All bids for connection count.

370
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,760
- What if it doesn't work?
- I can always refund your misery.

371
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,160
I was ominous just then.

372
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,560
Grande's not going to like you
talking to Prudence.

373
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,760
I know, but I must deliver
this apology letter to her.

374
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,360
- Do you think Grande saw us?
- Of course not, Rajneesh.

375
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,000
We are completely hidden by this bush.

376
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,080
This may go badly.

377
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,240
Keep the elephant running.

378
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,480
Prudence?

379
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,240
My little cabbage?

380
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,720
While I do your calves,
I'd like to sing a song

381
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,400
by the greatest singer ever
from Quebec, Miss Celine Dion.

382
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>You were my strength when I was weak</i>

383
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,120
<i>You were my voice
when I couldn't speak</i>

384
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
<i>You were my eyes when I...</i>

385
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,920
<i>You saw the best there was in me</i>

386
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,200
No!

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>You were my eye...</i>

388
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,960
Do not peck my fucking eyes!
Don't peck my eyes!

389
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,760
<i>Lifted me up when I couldn't reach</i>

390
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,320
<i>You gave me faith 'cause you believed</i>

391
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,640
<i>I'm everything I am</i>

392
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,240
<i>Because you love me</i>

393
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,680
That was beautiful.

394
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,320
And now, I'd like to show my love
by making for you a Quebec pizza.

395
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,320
- What's that?
- Pop-Tart with the ketchup.

396
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,760
She's good.

397
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,640
Guru Pitka? What happened to you?

398
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,840
Nothing. Why do you ask?

399
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,440
We've not much time.
I have an apology letter from Darren.

400
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,520
Well, you know, I got attacked
by a rooster. So, you know.

401
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,040
Yeah.

402
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,000
So he writes one stupid note
and you expect me to take him back?

403
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,400
- Perhaps I can change him.
- Ding-dong.

404
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,200
Did someone order
the special Quebec pizza, eh?

405
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
You know, like in the porno.

406
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,440
- Who is this in my house?
- Whoa!

407
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Looks like he's smuggling a schnauzer.

408
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
Yeah.

409
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,480
Let me show you out.

410
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,760
Down, boy.

411
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,280
Read the letter.

412
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,120
- Nice place, eh?
- Yeah.

413
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
And I got her cheap.

414
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
So, it's an honor to have you
here in my house, Guru Pitka.

415
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,320
I think you are an amazing guru, and...

416
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,680
Hey! Mister!

417
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,160
What did you do to my rooster?

418
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

419
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
Stay away from my girlfriend!

420
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,040
The Wolverine.

421
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Don't look at me with that tone of voice,
or I punch you in the shirt!

422
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,800
Okay, gotta go.

423
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
Beat it. I gotta take a dump.

424
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,640
Bodhisattva!

425
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,520
Hello, superstar.
Welcome to my new Toronto ashram.

426
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,880
Uncle Jack.

427
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,480
Can I get a hand
getting off this elephant?

428
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Darren, if your Uncle Jack
helped you off an elephant,

429
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,200
would you help your Uncle
Jack off an elephant?

430
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,960
That's funny to you?

431
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know where I get it.

432
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,240
So did you give Prudence
my apology letter or what?

433
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,960
- Yes, of course!
- Did it work?

434
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Let me answer it this way.

435
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am!

436
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Now, your entourage must stay behind.

437
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,360
No, no, no, no, no. They protect me.

438
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,840
Well, they didn't protect you
from that outfit, now, did they?

439
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,400
What?

440
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,000
What's wrong with shark skin?

441
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,960
More like gay-skin, how about.
What? Yeah.

442
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,120
Snaps.

443
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,440
- Right, let's talk about Jacques Grande!
- No! Leave that man out of this.

444
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
You feel inadequate,

445
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,080
because he has plenty of clarity,
organization, charm, and knowledge.

446
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
TM.

447
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Yeah, he's got a lot of that, all right.

448
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,440
Therefore, he's able to say to Prudence,

449
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,120
"Be loving and open-hearted
with my emotions."

450
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,480
TM.

451
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
You better stop right there.

452
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,120
Blowme is a good way
to remember that. Blowme, yeah.

453
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,480
Blowme, yeah. Blowme.

454
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,720
Blowme.

455
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,600
- You should stop.
- Well, I'm sure you're sick of this.

456
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,360
I know Prudence
has had it up to here with Grande.

457
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
All right, you know what?

458
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
I can't move my body!

459
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,040
It is an Indian martial art
known as "how to hurt a guy."

460
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,960
I am poking your third eye.

461
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
And if I twist my thumb,
I can make you crap yourself!

462
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,880
So, what do you want me to do?

463
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,600
What I need is to get you
to follow my method, Drama.

464
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
We must distract you
from your emotional pain,

465
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
regress you back to your childhood.

466
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,840
We must adjust your negativity,
mature you, and put it all into action.

467
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,800
If you follow my method,
not only will you win Stanley's Cup,

468
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,040
but you'll also get Prudence back.

469
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
You think this'll work?

470
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

471
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
No, you might want to
pick up some Depends.

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,480
I may have twisted my thumb. Yeah.

473
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,080
Check for coins.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Think fast.

475
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,720
Drama!

476
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,360
Drama.

477
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,840
Students, now I am going to teach you
the "D" of drama. Distraction.

478
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Maurice, if Plato,
Shakespeare and Einstein

479
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,280
were talking about the meaning of life,

480
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,320
and two elephants
started humping outside,

481
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,400
even they would rush to the window.

482
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,360
It is the ultimate distraction.

483
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,720
We shall now compete in a game of tag.

484
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,640
It is called Stink Mop.

485
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
Enter, Sanjay!

486
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,560
Enter, Maurice.

487
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,840
Commence Stink Mop.

488
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
Stink Mop! Stink Mop!

489
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,600
- Stink Mop.
- Go.

490
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,720
- Stink Mop.
- Stink Mop!

491
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,000
Maurice.

492
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,640
What are you not thinking about?

493
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,320
I am not thinking about my chastity belt.

494
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,240
- That is distraction.
- Yes!

495
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,720
I get it! I am distracted!

496
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Good distraction frees us
from emotional pain.

497
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,760
Bad distraction gives you
a mouth full of whizz.

498
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,440
- Once again, I'm Trent Lueders.
- And I'm Jay Kell.

499
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,720
Go, Leafs, go! Go, Leafs, go!

500
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,680
<i>Tonight, game one
of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

501
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,760
<i>L.A. Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs.
It's gonna get ugly.</i>

502
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,320
Ugly. You want to hear ugly?

503
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,240
At Promises, I shivved a guy
with a sharpened toothbrush

504
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,720
because he bogarted
the rehab toilet hooch

505
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,480
that I'd made
from apples and pantyhose.

506
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,760
That was ugly.

507
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,600
Over to you, Trent.

508
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,040
Thanks, Jay.

509
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,440
All right, guys. Bring it in.

510
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,560
Let's rip off their heads
and shit down their necks!

511
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah!

512
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
- Go! Go!
- Here we go!

513
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,920
Now, the first lesson is distraction.

514
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,480
In order to learn distraction,

515
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,200
you're not allowed to fight anyone
in today's hockey match.

516
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,240
I'm a hockey player!

517
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,560
That's what hockey players do.
We fight!

518
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,880
It's a problem.

519
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,360
Even Jay-Z had 99 of them,
and the bitch was not one of them.

520
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,840
Now, do you want to win Stanley's Cup?

521
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,120
Yes, I wanna win the Stanley Cup!

522
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
Then you are not allowed
to fight anyone for any reason!

523
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,560
Don't fight!
Now, get out there, and don't kill them.

524
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,320
- What is that?
- Corn dog.

525
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,400
What is it?

526
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,600
Is it made from dog?

527
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,520
What a freaking idiot.

528
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,520
Is this a dog's thingy?
Am I being punk'd?

529
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Leafs take the ice.</i>

530
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,320
Hello, Los Angeles Kings.

531
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,440
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

532
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,120
And I have a message
from Darren Roanoke.

533
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,520
He told me to tell you
that you're all his bitches,

534
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,080
and that you can suck his big greasy...

535
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,080
Mariska Hargitay.

536
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,040
- I'm gonna kill you, Roanoke!
- You're dead, Roanoke!

537
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,120
Damn, Roanoke!

538
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,040
<i>And we're getting ready to drop the
puck for game one of the Finals.</i>

539
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,320
- I know I'm excited, Jay. How are you?
- I am rigid.

540
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,000
<i>It's a yard sale!</i>

541
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,440
- What?
- Not to fight.

542
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,600
You are not to fight anyone.

543
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,640
I would not wanna be his nutsack.

544
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,840
<i>They're coming after Roanoke!</i>

545
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,200
Get up!

546
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,160
What the hell are you doing?

547
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,160
Superstar, look at your hands.

548
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,280
- They're not shaking!
- Yes.

549
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,560
<i>Roanoke with the puck. What a pass!</i>

550
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,520
Goal!

551
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,720
Roanoke may be fighting for his life,
but he's playing great!

552
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,280
<i>Rob Blake is lucky
the refs didn't see that.</i>

553
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,240
But the refs will see that
on our post-game highlight reel.

554
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,000
That is the Altoids " Curiously Strong
Elbow to the Face" of the game.

555
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,600
Oh, God. Am I still dreaming?

556
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,960
No. Why do you ask?

557
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,120
Why'd you tell me not to fight?

558
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,680
Because you are now distracted,
therefore playing better.

559
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,120
It's the only way.

560
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
Yeah, well,
I can't keep getting my ass kicked!

561
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,040
Fine! Fight anyone for any reason.

562
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,640
You just said don't fight...

563
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,800
- What, it's just arbitrary with you?
- Of course not!

564
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,120
But we will let the dice decide.

565
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,440
Yes, it is arbitrary!
Fight anyone for any reason!

566
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,200
Fight anyone.

567
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,080
It's a bench-clearing brawl!

568
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,560
Remember, kids, this is not
how you play hockey.

569
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,800
- It's just ugly.
- I like it.

570
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,640
That was a good one.

571
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,320
One game suspension, Roanoke!

572
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,680
Way to go, Roanoke! You jag-off!

573
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,440
- Him, too?
- Anyone for any reason.

574
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,800
I love my job!

575
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,160
- Two games!
- Now, it's a two-game suspension.

576
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,760
That would mean Roanoke
would be out for game two and three!

577
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,240
He could play in game four.

578
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,560
Of course, we don't know
if we're going to game five!

579
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,120
Two and three, out,
can't play in the game.

580
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
He could watch the game at home,
but he can't play!

581
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,800
He can pretend to play
while he's at home,

582
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,720
but he cannot play on the ice
in the game that we're watching,

583
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,120
which is after this game,
'cause we're in game one.

584
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,720
You have a firm grasp of the obvious.

585
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,080
How could he do that?

586
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
Are you all right?

587
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,080
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Wow, these things are heavy. Yeah.

588
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
- Put me down, A-hole!
- Okay.

589
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,720
<i>And the Kings take the first game
of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

590
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,360
Damn it!

591
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
Cherkov, relax!

592
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,560
- Now, everyone, let's just take a seat.
- Okay.

593
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,960
First of all, let's agree next time
we decide to have a group meeting,

594
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,960
we take it in my office.

595
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,680
Now, Guru Pitka here
obviously has a plan.

596
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,440
So, Guru, enlighten us.
What is your plan?

597
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,000
Frankly, this is completely unexpected,
and I'm scared shitless.

598
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
- No, no!
- Let me at him!

599
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,240
- Take it easy, Frodo.
- No! Get back! No!

600
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,400
No! No!

601
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,600
Hippie queer!

602
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,960
- Throw a hex on you.
- Okay, okay.

603
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,480
Isn't there any way
that you could skip a step or two?

604
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,400
No way!
With Drama, there is no shortcuts.

605
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,000
We must now
take him back to his childhood.

606
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,360
- His childhood?
- Yes.

607
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,360
His mother only lives an hour away,

608
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,520
but he won't allow her
to go to the games.

609
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,960
Interesting.

610
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,240
He won't allow his mother
to come to any of his games!

611
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,080
Come, Rajneesh, a breakthrough!

612
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,840
Little help, please!

613
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,400
Okay. All right.

614
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,880
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,880
- Where are you going?
- To see Darren.

616
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,720
Jane, I promise you,
everything will be fine.

617
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,000
Come by my ashram, then I will explain.

618
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,720
Coach Cherkov, I would invite you,

619
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,200
but I know you have your meeting
with the Lollipop Guild.

620
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,800
Why won't you let your mother come to
any of your hockey games?

621
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
'Cause, man,
I don't play well around her, man.

622
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,520
She freaks me out.

623
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,000
Then tomorrow we will go to her!

624
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,400
- Oh, hell no! Oh, hell no!
- Oh, hells yes!

625
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,000
<i>- Yeah.
- This ain't Driving Miss Daisy, man.</i>

626
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,960
I'll break your fingers.

627
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,360
Okay. Yo, this my street right here.

628
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,960
- Tonawanda Street.
- Tonawanda Street?

629
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,200
I know this street.

630
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,920
- You do?
- Yes.

631
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,200
- At what number did you live?
- Fifty-three.

632
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,720
Do you know a Dickie Withers at 85?

633
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,160
- No.
- Well, it does.

634
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,440
A dickie does wither at 85.
I own you! Yeah!

635
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,280
Yeah! You are laughing!

636
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,680
You see, you're filled with joy of a child!

637
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
You are now ready to meet your ma.

638
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm warning you, GP, my mom's tough.

639
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,880
Oh, please. How bad can she be?

640
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,880
<i>Raise it up and make a joyful noise</i>

641
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,560
<i>Oh, I shall not be moved</i>

642
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,120
<i>- No, no, no, no
- No, I shall not be moved</i>

643
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,160
<i>No, no</i>

644
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,640
<i>Lead me to your rock</i>

645
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,280
<i>Where I shall not be</i>

646
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,360
<i>I shall not be moved</i>

647
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,760
Remember, Darren,
you must stand up to her.

648
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,840
Got it.

649
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,200
- Baby boy.
- Oh, Mom.

650
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,920
Now, why won't you let your ma
come see you play?

651
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
It's just that you're not always
the most supportive, Ma.

652
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,040
Supportive?

653
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Pressure makes diamonds.

654
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,480
Pressure also makes rubble.

655
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,080
And after a good whipping,
cream rises to the top.

656
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
So does scum!

657
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,840
- You're the Guru Pitka.
- Yes, I am.

658
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,200
You're like
the poor man's Deepak Chopra.

659
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,440
Game over.

660
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,160
- Oh, Mom, don't, don't.
- Do you have something to say to me?

661
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes, you do. Yes, go ahead.

662
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,960
Yes.

663
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,160
You change your hair color?
'Cause it looks nice.

664
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,040
We'll talk in the car.

665
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,280
Well, this was fun.

666
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,720
And by fun, of course
I mean emotionally scarring.

667
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,480
I know you are not trying to tell me
how to raise my child.

668
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,880
Gotta go.

669
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,720
- Superstar! Superstar, wait!
- Whoa!

670
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,480
Look at you. You're jumpy.
You're like prison bitch jumpy.

671
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,800
I told you that
we shouldn't have come here.

672
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,840
No, no, no, no, no.

673
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,880
We have to go back in there
and confront your mother.

674
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,920
There has to be another way.

675
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,440
Well, I hear you rappin'
Sister McCrappin'.

676
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,200
Okay, there are two ways
to regress you.

677
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,040
One involves your mother,
your shame core,

678
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,840
and a grueling process
of intense self-examination.

679
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,280
- What's the other way?
- Well...

680
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,920
What does this sound like?

681
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,360
I am making diarrhea sounds
with my cup.

682
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,120
I'm regressing you.

683
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,680
Someone's in here. Someone's in here!

684
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,280
Yes. You are laughing!

685
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,200
Why am I laughing, man?

686
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,000
Look what you did to my jacket.

687
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,000
Ball-gazer!

688
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,960
Go ahead!

689
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,480
You bastard.
You totally caught me in a ball-gaze.

690
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,480
Congratulations,
you have been regressed.

691
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,920
I own you!

692
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,360
- Yes, you own me.
- That was easy.

693
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,800
But with ownership
comes responsibility.

694
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,400
<i>It was at this point that I realized</i>

695
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,760
<i>that my student
was finally shedding his defenses.</i>

696
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,920
What are you doing?

697
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,080
<i>He said while eating a chicken wing.</i>

698
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,880
I am talking into my voice-over machine.

699
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,760
<i>So, the Leafs lose game two
by a whopping six-to-one score.</i>

700
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,800
<i>The Leafs look rattled without Roanoke.</i>

701
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,840
- It's Darren Roanoke.
- You mean Roan-choke more like.

702
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,120
That's great. Nice hat.

703
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,000
- I had a hat like that once.
- Yeah?

704
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,240
Then my mom got a job.

705
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,880
Looks like I'm gonna have to shove
these love beads someplace special.

706
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,960
You got a problem?

707
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me handle this.

708
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,320
There are two things about violence
they teach you when becoming a guru.

709
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,800
The first thing is,

710
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,640
an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.

711
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,400
The second thing is,

712
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,760
never ever watch the bottle.

713
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,360
You son of a bitch!

714
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,120
It's a bar fight!

715
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
Down, down!

716
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,040
Watch out!

717
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,480
- Well done!
- Nice job!

718
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,240
Hold on, hold on.

719
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,720
Niagara Falls is amazing.

720
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,680
Darren.

721
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Just because
your mother only loved you

722
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,600
when you achieved

723
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,800
doesn't mean that Prudence will
only love you when you achieve.

724
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,440
I was afraid
that Prudence would leave me

725
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,080
if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

726
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,880
- so I left Prudence first.
- That's it!

727
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,200
However, we must
confront your mother.

728
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,400
Prudence always wanted me
to stand up to my ma.

729
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,440
- I know.
- I miss Prudence.

730
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,720
I miss the connection.

731
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,600
- Connection.
- Yeah.

732
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,720
<i>Making love.
Falling asleep in each other's arms.</i>

733
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
<i>Sometimes we would wake up
a couple hours later,</i>

734
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,240
<i>and it'd be like we were
the only two people in the world.</i>

735
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,640
<i>Prudence would stare into my eyes,
and she'd say...</i>

736
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,920
<i>- Damn.
- Damn.</i>

737
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
<i>It sort of became our song.</i>

738
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
You are a very lucky man.

739
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,000
I would like to have
a"damn" moment like that someday.

740
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,600
How can you be the Love Guru
if you've never been in a relationship?

741
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,920
Well, there is someone I like.

742
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
But until I learn to love myself,

743
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,960
I can only go out
with three girls named Ann.

744
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,200
- Three girls named Ann?
- Yeah.

745
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,000
Ann Visible, Ann Flatable, and Ann Job.

746
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,320
Ann Job!

747
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,760
Well, you know,
I deflect because of the pain.

748
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,160
I gotta get my girl back, GP.

749
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,920
Otherwise,
what am I gonna do with this?

750
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
I have two tattoos.

751
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,520
One tattoo is the Drama tattoo,

752
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,480
which signifies
the self-determinist philosophy

753
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,560
of the Tugginmypudha Ashram.

754
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,720
And what's the other tattoo?

755
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,880
Daffy Duck pushing a lawn mower
through my pubes.

756
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,200
Look, he's dancing. Yeah. Right.

757
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,880
Ball-gazer! Oh, my God! There you go!

758
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,640
The ball-gazing student
has become the ball-gazing master.

759
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,720
<i>- Saying I love you
- Saying I love you</i>

760
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,720
<i>Is not the words
I want to hear from you</i>

761
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,040
<i>It's not that I want you not to say</i>

762
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,800
<i>But if you only knew</i>

763
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,960
<i>How easy it would be to</i>

764
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,920
<i>- Show me how you feel
- Show me how you feel</i>

765
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,280
<i>- More than words
- More than words</i>

766
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,120
<i>- Is all you have to do to make it real
- Is all you have to do to make it real</i>

767
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,200
<i>- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Then you wouldn't have to say</i>

768
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,560
<i>- That you love me
- That you love me</i>

769
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,120
<i>- 'Cause I'd already know
- 'Cause I'd already know</i>

770
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,520
<i>- More than words
- More than words</i>

771
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,800
<i>- More than words
- More than words</i>

772
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,880
That was great!

773
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,560
Thank you, Speedy. That's great.

774
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,920
Mariska Hargitay. That's great.

775
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,880
That was lovely.
But we need to talk about Darren.

776
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,720
- This is a disaster. He's my only...
- Jane! Do you trust me?

777
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,240
I do trust you.

778
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,680
I'm not really sure why.

779
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,920
It's the beard.
It makes me look like Santa.

780
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,920
And by the way, you look breathtaking.

781
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,080
- Thank you.
- As do I.

782
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Come.
My staff has prepared a lovely meal.

783
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,760
- Wow.
- Right?

784
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,680
I am so hungry
I could eat a skunk's bottom.

785
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,600
Which is a lot like calamari.
But that's not what we're having tonight.

786
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,560
Rajneesh will now prepare a dish

787
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,440
made of two lychees
wrapped in a doughy pouch.

788
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,640
- It's called Kartapal Birigalapatt.
- What's that mean?

789
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,480
Nuts in a sling.

790
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,040
Oh, thanks, but I'll pass.

791
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,800
Very well, I'll have your nuts in a sling.

792
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,640
Cough.

793
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,760
Reject this man.
Not fit for military service.

794
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,160
Would you like your nuts to be crushed?

795
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,120
Doesn't everyone? Who is this guy?

796
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,440
Geronimo!

797
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,840
That is our safe word.

798
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,360
Now, we get the nuts nice and hot,
so they tighten up and get firm.

799
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,280
That's good.

800
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,840
Feels good.
I mean, tastes good. I mean, what?

801
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,040
You want curlies on your nuts?

802
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,280
Do I look like a child?
Of course I want curlies on my nuts.

803
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,480
Don't forget your pickle.

804
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,920
- Would you like some soup instead?
- Yes.

805
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,520
Rajneesh, I'd like an alligator soup,
and make it snappy.

806
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,520
Because alligators are snappy,
and at the same time, I want it prompt.

807
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,520
Here it is. There's your soup.
Watch out! It's dangerous!

808
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,520
You're as cute as pie.

809
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,080
I haven't laughed like this
in such a long time.

810
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,600
Why not?

811
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,320
It's hard to laugh
when men only see you as some curse.

812
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,320
Jane, there is no curse.

813
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,080
You're just afraid of intimacy,
or into-me-l-see.

814
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,120
Remember, being vulnerable
is being woundable.

815
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,440
I say take the risk.

816
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,560
- Well, that's easy to say and hard to do.
- Is it?

817
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,560
What's the downside
of throwing away your fear?

818
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,600
The only way out is in.

819
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,480
I think I'm about to risk something.

820
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,760
- What's wrong?
- We can't do this.

821
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,280
What? You tell me to be vulnerable,

822
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,400
and then you turn around
and wound me?

823
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,840
- I can explain.
- Okay, go ahead.

824
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,200
I can't explain.

825
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,760
- I should go.
- No, Jane, wait! I...

826
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,040
Jane! Jane!

827
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,800
<i>Game three here in Los Angeles.
The L.A. Kings have beaten the Leafs.</i>

828
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,840
They are one game away
from a Stanley Cup victory.

829
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,080
They can't be happy
in the Leafs' locker room right now.

830
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,360
I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second.
Have they dropped the puck?

831
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,720
Damn it! We're down three games

832
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,760
because you decided
you couldn't win without Roanoke.

833
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,520
And you! You're just a stupid rich girl!

834
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,320
You were born on third,
and you think you hit a triple!

835
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,640
You don't know hockey!

836
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,520
- Are you finished?
- No!

837
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,760
- Now I'm finished! And, Pitka!
- Yes?

838
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,440
- What's the capital of Thailand?
- Bangkok.

839
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,760
Exactly.

840
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,480
Omar Sharif, my balls!

841
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,000
My balls, you prick!

842
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,600
- Stay down, bitch!
- Okay.

843
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,080
Jane! Jane, wait!

844
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,560
He's right! I'm just a stupid rich girl
about to be a huge failure.

845
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,560
Failure?
There's no such thing as failure.

846
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,760
Only early attempts at success.

847
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,320
You know what? I hired you
to fix Darren Roanoke. Do your job!

848
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,440
<i>Your Holiness,
I spoke with the producers at Oprah,</i>

849
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,960
and if they don't see Darren and
Prudence together by the next game,

850
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,040
your spot will go to Deepak.

851
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,600
But Darren is not ready!
He must truly deal with his mother.

852
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,800
- And I will not take a shortcut.
- Take a shortcut!

853
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,880
Do you want to be
the next Deepak Chopra or not?

854
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,800
<i>Babu, you cannot take a shortcut.</i>

855
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,240
But I need to become
the next Deepak Chopra!

856
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,280
But how will you get Grande
away from Prudence?

857
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,920
I have one idea that just might work.
Yeah.

858
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the incredible Miss Celine Dion!</i>

859
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,200
Celine! It is my day of lucky!

860
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,400
What'll you have?

861
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,400
- A martini.
- All right, then.

862
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,480
Jacques Grande.
Is he "Mr. Right" or "Mr. Right Now?"

863
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
Jacques and I get along just fine.

864
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,120
You have,
what we call in the guru business,

865
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,880
"love without knowledge."

866
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,720
But what you had with Darren
is love with knowledge.

867
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,000
A real connection.

868
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,240
Come by my ashram tomorrow at noon.

869
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,400
I will show you a Darren
who is completely changed.

870
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,400
Do you think he's really changed?

871
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,480
I mean, he can't even play
in front of his own mother.

872
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,160
She's like kryptonite to him.

873
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,720
Can't play in front of his mother?

874
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,040
Hey! I said stay away from the girl!

875
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,320
Rajneesh, let's make like a baby
and head out.

876
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,440
- So you went to see your mother?
- Yes.

877
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,000
But did you stand up to her?

878
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,680
He doesn't have to stand up
to his mother.

879
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,840
- Yes, he does!
- Not now, Kato.

880
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,400
Now, aren't there a few more steps
in your Drama plan?

881
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,840
- Yes. Maturity and Action.
- Beat it, Rajneesh.

882
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,680
Yes. We did Maturity and Action.

883
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,360
"M" and "A" spells "ma," and we went
to Buffalo and we saw his ma.

884
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,720
Right. See?

885
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,600
You see, I left 'cause I was scared
that if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

886
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,840
you would leave me.

887
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,800
But I don't care
if you win the Stanley Cup.

888
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,160
Can you forgive me?

889
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,400
Of course I can forgive you.

890
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,600
Stick a fork in them, they're done.

891
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,280
Champers wishes!

892
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,320
It would be great
if you could stick around for a while.

893
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
You know,
just to make sure Darren's okay.

894
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,720
Yes, of course. Yeah, business.
Yes, of course.

895
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,120
Would His Holiness staying on
qualify as an extension?

896
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
<i>Pants! Sheket Bevakasha!</i>

897
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,160
Because if that were the case,
we would refuse payment.

898
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,680
<i>- Of course, I'll stay, Jane.
- Until we get the call from Oprah.</i>

899
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,120
Go to your naughty mat, Dick!

900
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,680
Miss Bullard.

901
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,160
Mariska Hargitay.

902
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,680
Your Holiness? Mark my words,
this shortcut will haunt you.

903
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,360
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

904
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,520
<i>Game four here in Los Angeles.</i>

905
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,120
<i>The Kings are one win away
from a Stanley Cup victory.</i>

906
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,120
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!

907
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,040
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!

908
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,720
<i>This is it, folks. Game four.</i>

909
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,800
<i>If Roanoke doesn't pull through,
it's all over for the Leafs.</i>

910
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,320
<i>Roanoke with the puck.</i>

911
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,920
<i>- He shoots! He scores!
- Yeah!</i>

912
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,160
<i>Wasting no time after his suspension,
he is back!</i>

913
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,880
<i>The end of game four,
and the Leafs take it two to zero.</i>

914
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,520
<i>Thanks to Roanoke,
the Leafs advance to game five.</i>

915
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,280
Go Leafs.

916
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,080
<i>Game five here in Los Angeles.
Can the Leafs do it again?</i>

917
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,720
<i>Roanoke just playing amazing!</i>

918
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,320
<i>Goal! And game five goes to the Leafs!
An incredible comeback!</i>

919
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,160
<i>Thanks to Roanoke,
the Leafs have got the Kings on the run.</i>

920
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,840
And look at this crowd!
They are guru crazy!

921
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,840
<i>Game six here in Toronto!</i>

922
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,000
<i>Beautiful pass!</i>

923
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,200
Go! Go! Go!

924
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,560
<i>Roanoke on a breakaway!
Five-hole trap!</i>

925
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,840
<i>Grande saves! Roanoke denied!</i>

926
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,120
- Once again, I'm Trent Lueders.
- And I'm Jay Kell.

927
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,880
Roanoke fell for the five-hole trap.

928
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,800
For those of you who don't know
what that is, allow me to "Kellistrate."

929
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,560
<i>There are four holes.
One for each corner.</i>

930
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,920
The five-hole is here, between the legs.

931
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,200
<i>You can try to beat him here. Or here.
Or even way down here.</i>

932
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,280
Thanks, Jay.
Let's get back to the action.

933
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,200
<i>Roanoke has done it! We're all tied!</i>

934
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,120
<i>The Leafs have won
three straight games!</i>

935
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,880
<i>Game seven will be in Toronto.</i>

936
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,080
<i>- Hey!
- It's down to one game.</i>

937
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,360
Get me out of here, pricks!

938
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,720
<i>...champion. I just got the call.
You are 100% booked on Oprah.</i>

939
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,360
Great.

940
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,000
<i>I got on Oprah, right?</i>

941
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,040
- I'm the next Deepak Chopra, right?
- You are.

942
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,200
He's definitely in.

943
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,560
- Doesn't feel good, does it?
- Get off my tits!

944
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,280
Congratulations.

945
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,600
Darren and Prudence are back together,
we got a shot at winning the Cup,

946
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,480
<i>and you got on Oprah.
I suppose all that's left is...</i>

947
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,960
The check.

948
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,880
Yeah. Here we go.

949
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,400
Oh, my pretty.
Miss Bullard, it has been terrific.

950
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,960
Now, if any of your other players
have any professional catastrophe,

951
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,760
personal pain, or a drug addiction,
please do not hesitate to call.

952
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,800
Your Holiness,
the check and I will be in the car.

953
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,400
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

954
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,840
- I guess you got everything you wanted.
- Not everything, Jane.

955
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,840
Well, say there was this guru, say.

956
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,240
And this guru was, you know,
handsome, you know,

957
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,400
had a nice gleam in his eye,
a nice tuck in his butt, say.

958
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,080
And say this guru,
maybe not me, maybe somebody else,

959
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,640
had a certain vow.

960
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,160
What kind of vow?

961
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,920
Forget about it. Just Etch A Sketch
everything I was saying.

962
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,320
Mariska Hargitay.

963
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,560
Mariska Hargitay.

964
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,240
<i>Well, here we go. Game seven.</i>

965
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,040
It all comes down to this,
ladies and gentlemen.

966
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,320
Who do you like tonight, Jay?

967
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,880
Jay?

968
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,000
I like the Christmas babies, Trent!

969
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,160
And I like the way my skin feels
when I'm wearing my rainbow jacket!

970
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,320
By your command.

971
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,800
You're back on drugs, aren't you?

972
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,800
Yes, I am, asshole-face man!

973
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,880
By the power of Gahar,
I command thee to vanish!

974
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
- Let's see what's happening rinkside.
- No!

975
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,920
Well, here comes Lucy the elephant.

976
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,760
<i>I cannot be killed but with fire!</i>

977
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,800
<i>The Deluca Brothers Circus is
coming to town. Isn't that just adorable?</i>

978
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,040
Well, whoever wins tonight
walks away Stanley Cup champions.

979
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,840
Listen up! It's down to one game,
and we've got the momentum!

980
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,640
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

981
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,360
Why you got your heads down?

982
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,200
We can beat these clowns.

983
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,400
Besides, I still have
a few trick on my sleeve.

984
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,640
<i>Flight 22 to Chicago
is now boarding at Gate Five.</i>

985
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,160
<i>Our plane leaves in 20 minutes.
The people at Oprah are very excited!</i>

986
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,320
That's great.

987
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,960
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing The Star-Spangled Banner,</i>

988
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,800
<i>mother of Leafs' center,
Darren Roanoke, Lillian Roanoke.</i>

989
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,680
That's Darren's mother!
Quaking pudding!

990
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,480
Hi, baby!

991
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,120
What do I do?

992
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,240
I don't know!

993
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,360
<i>Oh, say, can you see</i>

994
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,400
<i>By the dawn's early light</i>

995
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,920
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

996
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
Hey!

997
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,120
<i>Roanoke is freaking out...</i>

998
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,960
What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

999
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,560
<i>No, no! Nothing to see here.
Our plane is about to leave for Oprah,</i>

1000
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,040
and we have to go realize
every dream we've ever had.

1001
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,200
I am not going with you, Dick.

1002
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,560
Oh, no! No!

1003
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,680
If you don't get on that plane,
I will take 60% of the ashram!

1004
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,880
Fine. I don't need material things.

1005
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,560
I was put on this earth
to spread a message of peace and love.

1006
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,920
- Give me that ticket! Give me it!
- No! Please, no!

1007
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,520
You will never be
the next Deepak Chopra!

1008
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,480
What?

1009
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,640
Box him out!

1010
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,480
Oh, damn.

1011
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,960
<i>At the end of the first period,</i>

1012
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,680
<i>the Kings lead the Leafs,
one to nothing.</i>

1013
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,880
<i>And the question on everyone's mind is,
where's Roanoke?</i>

1014
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,920
Baby, are you all right?

1015
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,360
I can't play in front of you, Ma!

1016
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,920
It's all my fault for not putting
more pressure on you to succeed.

1017
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,160
- Yes.
- Hello?

1018
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,760
Jane, I'm on my way.

1019
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,240
- I thought you said he was cured!
- I was wrong.

1020
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,040
Tell Coach Cherkov to buy some time!

1021
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,360
Okay.

1022
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,360
Sir, please, please make sure
it's locked, sir. Please, over there.

1023
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1024
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,240
Dell Computers, this is Chip.

1025
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,120
Rajneesh, I...
Wait a second, who is Chip?

1026
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,720
I took another job.

1027
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,120
Rajneesh, you have to come meet me!

1028
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,160
<i>I must finish my job with Darren.</i>

1029
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,240
<i>- you're back, babu!
- yes!</i>

1030
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,560
Bodhisattva!

1031
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,200
- Boo! You suck, Bullard!
- No, you suck!

1032
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,320
You can say bad things about me,
but I won't say bad things about myself!

1033
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,320
So, guess what?
You can all just kiss my Canadian ass!

1034
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,040
Cherkov, Pitka's coming. You...

1035
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,800
Are you as turned on as I am right now?

1036
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,360
You're a bad, bad person.

1037
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,040
I'll take that as a yes.

1038
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,800
Pitka's coming. Just stall.

1039
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,800
Hey, ref! Time-out!

1040
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,640
<i>Leafs call their last time-out.</i>

1041
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,440
- Darren?
- Come on, baby.

1042
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,040
- Jane!
- You lied to me!

1043
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,240
Yes. I only pulled away from you
because of this.

1044
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,320
My name is the Guru Pitka,
and I wear a chastity belt.

1045
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,720
So, you didn't reject me.
You're just devoted to a higher purpose.

1046
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,160
Yes, Jane.

1047
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,120
Superstar, it's me, Guru Pitka!

1048
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,640
Good luck. He won't even let me in.

1049
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,000
Darren, I took a shortcut with you,
and I'm sorry.

1050
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,960
Now, what is it you can't face?

1051
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,400
- What did you say to me?
- What is it you can't face?

1052
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,000
- I can't face my ma.
- Then that's what you have to face.

1053
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,040
- Will you help me?
- I can't.

1054
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,080
You're on your own
when it comes to your mother.

1055
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,800
Darren, the only way out is in.

1056
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,800
Yes, yes, yes, it's good.

1057
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,280
It's good, it's good,
it's good, it's good, it's good.

1058
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,800
What the hell happened to you?

1059
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,040
Ma! I'm a grown man,
and I can take it from here.

1060
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,640
I love you.

1061
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,240
I love you, baby boy.

1062
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,360
Now, how long will it take you
to get dressed and get down to the ice?

1063
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,960
- Five minutes.
- Well, you better hurry up,

1064
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,960
'cause there's only six minutes
left in the game!

1065
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,240
Go, baby boy! Go, go, go, go, go!

1066
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,920
I think I made a happy wee-wee. Yeah.

1067
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,120
Come on. Let's go quickly!
Come on. Come, come. Hello?

1068
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:48,680
Action picks up here in game seven
with only 31 seconds left to go.

1069
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,000
- Coach, I'm ready.
- Get in there!

1070
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,240
Darren Roanoke is in the game!

1071
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,240
Hey, Rob Blake. The first thing
they teach you about hockey

1072
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,520
is never ever watch the puck.

1073
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,800
<i>Roanoke's going for the Ice Slam!</i>

1074
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1075
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,040
We're all tied up, folks,
with only eight seconds left!

1076
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,600
- Seven, six, five, four...
- Seven, six, five, four...

1077
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,680
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

1078
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,760
<i>Roanoke on the breakaway,
just him and Grande!</i>

1079
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,320
<i>With one second left! It's a penalty shot.</i>

1080
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,200
<i>Roanoke could win
the Stanley Cup here.</i>

1081
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,720
Hey!

1082
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,520
Listen, Darren, I know we are rivals,
but fate chose these sides, not us.

1083
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,320
So, before you take this shot,
I just need to say

1084
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,440
damn!

1085
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,200
Show it to me.

1086
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,960
Damn!

1087
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:31,600
I don't know what Grande just said
to Roanoke, but he is now out to lunch.

1088
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,720
Superstar! What did he say to you?

1089
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,360
He said, "Damn!"

1090
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,680
"Damn!" Quaking pudding.
That's not good.

1091
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,040
- Cherkov, call a time-out.
- We're out of time-outs.

1092
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,240
Just buy us some time.

1093
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,440
He needs a distraction. Jane, follow me!

1094
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,120
He's gotta take the shot, now!

1095
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,920
I promised myself I'd never do this.

1096
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,560
Hey, ref! I'm having a heart attack.

1097
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,760
Out of the way! Coach! Coach!

1098
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,520
Get the crash kit!

1099
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,360
- Sir, may I borrow your elephant, Lucy?
- Sure.

1100
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,560
Bodhisattva!

1101
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,800
Come, come! Come on, boy!
Elephant coming through!

1102
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,960
Come on, Bodhi!
Let's go quickly! Come on, Bodhi!

1103
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,880
Clear!

1104
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,440
Yes!

1105
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,560
Yes!

1106
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,160
Get busy, Bodhi.

1107
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,680
Eight seconds!

1108
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,640
What do you make of this?

1109
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,800
I think they're doing it, Trent.
I think they're doing it hard.

1110
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,760
Let's go to the Kellistrator.

1111
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,400
The ultimate distraction!

1112
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,920
- I love you.
- I love you.

1113
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,880
Post-ejaculation,
the barbs at the tip of the penis retract.

1114
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,720
Bing-bam-boom, you got
a baby pachyderm. Back to you, Trent.

1115
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,200
Now, what happens
if you don't score this goal?

1116
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,400
I'd still be a hero

1117
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,240
to me!

1118
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,080
Yes! "Gee, you are you." TM.

1119
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,480
Go get 'em!

1120
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,680
Come on, Roanoke! Let's go!

1121
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,200
Five-hole!

1122
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,280
No!

1123
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,800
<i>Five-hole trap!</i>

1124
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,200
<i>The Toronto Maple Leafs
have won the Stanley Cup!</i>

1125
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,920
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1126
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,760
Yeah!

1127
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,680
- I love hockey! I love hockey!
- I love hockey, too!

1128
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,720
They did it!

1129
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,240
The curse is over for the Leafs,
and I need to sleep!

1130
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,040
We didn't waste time.
We didn't waste no time.

1131
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,960
- Maurice?
- Deepak Chopra!

1132
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,120
Oprah called me,
and she said you canceled.

1133
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,280
I told her
she should give you another chance.

1134
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,440
As great as you are, I don't need
to become the next Deepak Chopra.

1135
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,680
I am the first Guru Pitka!

1136
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,840
You are free.

1137
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,240
You're a good man, Deepak Chopra.

1138
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,800
Hey, Pitka?
Sorry I punched you in the nuts.

1139
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,960
That's okay. Give me a hug.

1140
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,840
If you ever sucker punch me again,

1141
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,600
I'll kick your ass all the way back
to the Keebler factory.

1142
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,160
Give me a pound. Lock it down.

1143
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,000
Break the pickle. Tickle, tickle.

1144
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,000
- You.
- No, you.

1145
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,120
- Come on now, you.
- No, you.

1146
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,720
Well, no, you.

1147
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,440
<i>And so our story ends
where it all began,</i>

1148
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,120
<i>here in the tiny Indian village
of Harenmahkeester,</i>

1149
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,480
<i>in the valley of Lintinmybelli.</i>

1150
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,120
Oh, hi.

1151
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,960
- Maurice.
- Oh, my God. You look so beautiful.

1152
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,240
Thank you.

1153
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,200
Maurice.
You have finally learned to love yourself.

1154
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,160
You may now renounce
your vow of chastity.

1155
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,080
May I have the key?

1156
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,600
There is no key. There never was.

1157
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,720
There's a snap in the back.

1158
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,520
Thank you, Guru Tugginmypudha. Yeah.

1159
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,160
Are you leaving?

1160
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,520
The last rule of guru
is to rid student of the need of guru.

1161
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,640
Yes, of course.

1162
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,520
Okay, see you.

1163
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,600
Doesn't work sometimes.

1164
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,240
So, what do you want to do now?

1165
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,560
Well, I've been wearing this belt
since I was 12 years old.

1166
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,160
What do you think I want to do now?

1167
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,800
I want to sing!

1168
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,560
<i>Some people call me
the space cowboy, yeah</i>

1169
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,040
<i>Some call me the gangster of love</i>

1170
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,680
<i>Some people call me Maurice</i>

1171
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:20,480
<i>Because I speak
of the pompatus of love</i>

1172
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,720
<i>'Cause I'm a picker I'm a grinner</i>

1173

<i>- And I'm a sinner

01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,560
<i>He plays his music in the sun</i>
