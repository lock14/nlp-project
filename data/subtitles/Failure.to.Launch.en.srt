1
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:47,651
I just feel really close to you.

2
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:50,287
You are really close to me.

3
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,810
Well, this way we can share everything.

4
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,731
Wow, that's so good.

5
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:06,403
Look.

6
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,050
They're still so in love.

7
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:15,282
How great is that?

8
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,170
So, where do you see us going?

9
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:26,808
Well, tonight I see us
going back to my place.

10
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:41,849
Wow!

11
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,851
- This is your house?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,243
It's beautiful!

13
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:46,568
Thank you.

14
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:48,650
I like to come home to a nice place.

15
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,290
I'm happy. Are you happy?

16
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:01,163
Oh, yeah. Happy is what I'm all about.

17
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,489
Tripp, as long as you're up, Son...

18
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:10,049
Come on, Pop! Whoa, man.
Don't you knock?

19
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,129
What?

20
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:13,768
Your momma's...
She's snoring like a rhino.

21
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:16,169
And then this music got started...

22
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,610
Hey, you must be Melody.

23
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:21,283
Melissa.

24
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,086
Oh! It's Melissa!

25
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,573
It's Melissa. Okay. All right.

26
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:28,922
Y'all have a good time.

27
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,453
Night, Pop.

28
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,365
You live with your parents?

29
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,052
Is that a problem?

30
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:39,927
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,603
And she's leaving.

32
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:42,928
Stomping down the steps.

33
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:44,806
Unbelievable! Parents?

34
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,049
Putting on her coat.

35
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:48,005
Did you move that umbrella stand?

36
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,772
Oh, shit!

37
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:53,889
We gotta get rid of that thing.
You know we're gonna get sued?

38
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,003
Damn it!

39
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:56,933
And she's out.

40
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:00,207
Another one bites the dust.

41
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,211
And he is still here.

42
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,573
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning.

43
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,683
What do you say, Pop?

44
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:57,849
Good morning, Son.

45
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,566
Get any sleep last night?

46
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:19,369
- Okay, honey, there you go.
- You're the best, Mom.

47
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:31,973
Are you kidding me?

48
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:37,046
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

49
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,483
- Don't forget your snack.
- Thanks.

50
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,362
- Think fast!
- Bye!

51
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,653
So you dumped Melissa?

52
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,368
Well, technically, she dumped me.

53
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,007
What happened?

54
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,932
It was last night.
We were in a restaurant.

55
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:19,087
She sees this elderly couple
and they're holding hands,

56
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:22,570
and then she decides to hold my hand.

57
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,849
So she smiles at me.

58
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:29,933
Next thing I know,
she gives me "the look."

59
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:32,613
Dude, I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,247
No harm, no foul, though.

61
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:36,405
It was just time for her
to meet the parents.

62
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,482
Not the parents.

63
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,047
Bye-bye, Melissa.

64
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:41,443
Here we go again.

65
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,973
Yeah. What's your point?

66
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,562
The point is, my friend,

67
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,652
you are afraid of love.

68
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:51,922
Bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, man,
I'm not afraid of love.

69
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:55,925
I love love.
Look, I've had a lot of girlfriends, right?

70
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,965
And sometimes I'm the rebound guy.

71
00:05:58,094 --> 00:05:59,413
Other times, when I get lucky,

72
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:02,731
I'm the "explore new areas
of your sexuality" guy.

73
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:05,129
But every single time, we have fun.

74
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:06,888
Thank you.

75
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,608
I have fun, they have fun.
It's good for me, it's good for them.

76
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,407
And I would argue that it's damn good
for civilisation as a whole.

77
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,967
If more people thought that way...

78
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:15,129
I do sleep well at night.

79
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:18,929
On a twin bed, with Superman sheets
that you've had since you were six.

80
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,885
As opposed to you,
who sleeps in a king-sized bed

81
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,003
in your mother's basement?

82
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,567
It's orthopaedic, and I need it.

83
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,093
And at least I'm not sponging
off my parents

84
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,011
so I can afford to get laid
on every continent.

85
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,285
I'm a rambling man. I'm a tumbleweed.
I'm a seeker of truth.

86
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,372
And one truth I've learned,
a child is a parent's greatest joy.

87
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:37,253
Which is why I can't leave
my parents' place,

88
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:38,568
because they would miss me!

89
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:39,729
Amen, brother!

90
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,129
And yet, in America,
we're shunned for our lifestyle.

91
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,973
When we should be celebrating
our lifestyle.

92
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,649
- We are men who still live at home.
- Yes!

93
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,844
We're not here to apologise
about who we are, or how we do it,

94
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,202
- or who we live with.
- No!

95
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:54,451
I'm looking around this table, <i>hombres,</i>
and I see three winners.

96
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:56,724
And to every one of those out there
who sees something different,

97
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,207
I say bring it on!

98
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,767
'Cause it's going to take
a stick of dynamite

99
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:01,532
to get me out of my parents' house.

100
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,247
The boy's 35 years old!

101
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,409
It's just not fair.

102
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,490
Thirty-five years!

103
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:10,651
We were good parents,
and now we're supposed to be done!

104
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,049
Hey, I don't blame my kid for staying.

105
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,290
Our place is much nicer
than anything he can afford.

106
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:16,927
Well, our son's a flight attendant.

107
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:18,453
He travels so much
it doesn't make any sense

108
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:19,768
- to have his own apartment.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,533
Plus he has a lot of pilot friends
who let him stay over.

110
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:27,285
Well, I say the whole thing comes down
to being afraid to spank.

111
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,087
I mean you can't build a house
without a hammer!

112
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,569
Anyone for a guava smasher?

113
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,643
I learned to make them in Maui.
These really chase your troubles away.

114
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,763
Cheers, sweetie.

115
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,523
And who is my hot little <i>wahhne,</i> huh?

116
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,847
Bev? What is that?

117
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:50,605
Oh, I got this in Hawaii.
This is Lono, the god of fertility.

118
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:54,446
Bud has one, too.
Do you want to see it?

119
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,132
- No!
- No!

120
00:07:56,494 --> 00:08:00,123
No. I mean, what's going on here?

121
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:02,773
- Dougie moved out!
- Dougie moved out!

122
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,088
- What?
- You're kidding.

123
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,488
- Yes!
- When?

124
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,206
What, like two months ago!

125
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,972
It's been amazing!

126
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,652
Hey, how many times a week
do you think we do it?

127
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:11,729
- Oh!
- Oh, Bud.

128
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,253
What? Oh!

129
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:18,328
I can't believe it. How'd you do it?
Dougie's a sweet kid, but...

130
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,207
How in the world did you get him
to move out?

131
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,203
He met a girl.

132
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,370
Met a girl?
Tripp meets a new girl every week.

133
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:30,453
Well, let's just say maybe he hasn't met
the right girl.

134
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:38,210
Al, I don't want another recliner.
I want something new.

135
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,643
Hey, here's something new!

136
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,493
Cup holders.

137
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,889
That's not what I'm talking about.

138
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,362
- Okay.
- That's nice.

139
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:47,643
Get what you want.

140
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,766
Just know that I'm going to be having
an affair within the next six months.

141
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,727
If I've gotta recline,
I'm making it interesting.

142
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:54,809
Deal.

143
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,923
Hey, gang.

144
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,648
Let's stay on point here, huh?
We're picking out chairs.

145
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,603
Hello, Dolly!

146
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:03,247
Son, you see her?

147
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,533
Pop? Pick a chair.

148
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:07,723
This is the one I want.

149
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,446
- Sold.
- No, that's polka dot.

150
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:10,848
We're not gonna put that in the house.

151
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:11,929
Pop, relax.

152
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:13,885
She's taking the chair with her
when she leaves you.

153
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:16,922
We ain't buying that chair.

154
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:19,170
I am getting this polka-dot chair.
I've got my own money.

155
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,728
Unless you start dancing again,
you're broke.

156
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,687
Excuse me.

157
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,133
- That's mine.
- Yes, ma'am.

158
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:29,373
You're buying that?

159
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:30,449
No.

160
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,010
Want a cocktail, blanket or anything?

161
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,045
No, I just need my 20 minutes.

162
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,005
- For what?
- To clear my head.

163
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:43,771
I come here to relax.

164
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:47,764
You know what helps me?
Put on the Food Network.

165
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:49,766
Takes the edge right off.

166
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:51,646
Gotta find what works for you.

167
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:56,649
Okay, look, the salesmen don't mind
because I bring them coffee,

168
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:58,526
and the music selection
is a soothing blend

169
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,884
of mid-'70s singer-songwriters
and smooth jazz.

170
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,845
It's practically narcotic.

171
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:04,805
And, usually, people leave me alone.

172
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:06,287
Sure they do.

173
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,888
There's what you're talking about.

174
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:11,083
It's nice, huh?

175
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,411
Yeah! I make fun of my parents,
but these babies are sweet.

176
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:16,412
- I'm Paula.
- I'm Tripp.

177
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,923
You know, usually I don't sleep
with someone on the first date.

178
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:21,090
I don't think this counts as a first date.

179
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,087
It would be a date if you asked me
to have a drink tonight.

180
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,647
Wanna have a drink tonight?

181
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,930
Can't. How about lunch tomorrow?

182
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,522
Sure. Wait. Tomorrow's Saturday.

183
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:35,212
Sometimes I eat on Saturdays.

184
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,290
No, I'm doing something
with my nephew.

185
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,407
How about Monday?

186
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:42,768
I'll meet you here.

187
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,602
Beautiful.

188
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,009
Hey, hey!

189
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,364
Hey, Paula.

190
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:02,213
Good news, it's Champagne Thursday.

191
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,569
It's Friday.

192
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:06,003
Yeah, Thursday came twice this week.

193
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,652
For the third straight week.

194
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:10,685
There's talk of making it permanent.

195
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,372
Kind of like daylight-savings time?

196
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:14,450
Right. But for booze.

197
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,091
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

198
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,006
Shut up, you whore.

199
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,253
I'm sorry.
Was I sipping too loudly for you?

200
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,443
No, you're not sipping too loud.

201
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,283
It's that goddamn bird
outside my goddamn window.

202
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:30,451
What the hell kind of devil bird
chirps at night?

203
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,211
I think it sounds kind of pretty.

204
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,413
You met a guy today.

205
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:39,933
As a matter of fact, I did.

206
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:41,282
He's cute, too.

207
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,052
I met a guy today, too.

208
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,243
Really?

209
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:46,652
He's a radiologist.

210
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,332
Well, that's a step up.

211
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,287
He offered to give me a full-body scan
next week, free of charge.

212
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:52,483
Those don't come cheap, you know.

213
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:55,003
I know. I'm pretty excited about it.

214
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,763
How cute?

215
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:02,803
Cute.

216
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:05,444
Well, Tripp's a really nice guy.

217
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:08,532
He's smart, he's sweet, he's funny.

218
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:11,646
We had a wonderful first meeting.
I see incredible potential here.

219
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,207
So all systems are go?

220
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,245
Based on the initial
personality assessment,

221
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:17,729
I think that I can have your son
moved out of this house

222
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:20,493
and living on his own by June 15th.

223
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,688
Hallelujah!

224
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:25,290
Well, you know, you'd be amazed
at how many adult children

225
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:26,529
are still living at home.

226
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:30,169
Now, it's my opinion that the root cause
is a lack of self-esteem.

227
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:32,330
Oh, Oprah talks about that all the time.

228
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:33,682
Oprah don't know crap!

229
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:35,964
Heck, when I was growing up,
nobody had self-esteem,

230
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,129
and we turned out fine.

231
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:39,529
You're a rock, Al.
You make me a better woman.

232
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:43,442
Look, many young men who should
be able to move out, simply can't.

233
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:46,566
It's called "failure to launch."
And that's where I come in.

234
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:49,652
Young men develop self-esteem best
during a romantic relationship,

235
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,446
so I simulate one.

236
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,565
We have a memorable meeting.

237
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,163
We get to know each other
over a few casual meals,

238
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,932
he helps me through
an emotional crisis,

239
00:12:58,054 --> 00:12:59,328
then I meet his friends,

240
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,452
if he has any,

241
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,166
then I let him teach me something...

242
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,693
But the bottom line is,

243
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:05,923
he bonds with me.

244
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,612
He lets go of you.

245
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,133
He moves out.

246
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:13,444
But how do you make sure
that he'll fall in love with you?

247
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,530
You look nice,
you find out what they like,

248
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,451
and then you pretend to like it, too.

249
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,530
That is pretty much how it works.

250
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:22,083
What about sex?

251
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,250
Al, I never have sex with a client.

252
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,332
Besides, I need to keep Tripp motivated,

253
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,526
and let's face it, after men have sex...

254
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,652
Is there anything that we need to do?

255
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:36,652
Well, for starters, you could make life
a little more difficult for him.

256
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,608
You know, more chores,
more responsibilities, that kind of thing.

257
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,806
I just think you should know that Tripp
has had some rough breaks.

258
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,890
I promise you, when this is over,

259
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:48,687
Tripp is going to be an independent,

260
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:50,884
self-sufficient adult.

261
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,162
Shut up, dude! Don't help him!

262
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:54,932
- Watch the safety. No, no, no.
- No, he's in a run defence...

263
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,282
Don't do it! Don't do it! I got you!
I got you!

264
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:58,325
- Throw it to Moss. Throw it to Moss!
- Watch out! I'm going deep!

265
00:13:58,454 --> 00:13:59,853
No, you don't! Shit!

266
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:00,963
That's a bad word, Jeffrey.

267
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,608
So is "bastard," but that just means
your parents aren't married.

268
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:04,962
- Look at him! Look at him!
- No! Shit!

269
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,288
He could go all the way!

270
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:07,688
Touchdown!

271
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,167
Yes!

272
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,053
- Sit down!
- That's a face!

273
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,043
That's great, man.

274
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,573
That's good sportsmanship.
Nice dance.

275
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:17,766
Wow, my forehead itches.

276
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,571
That's cool, the "L" for loser.
Keep it up, little man.

277
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,888
I'll make you walk home.

278
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,083
Hell, you are such a good uncle.

279
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,045
That's like eight miles.
It'll take you two days.

280
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,243
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

281
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,773
- Hi.
- Tripp, we're going out.

282
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,249
All right, listen, you got any more
chips and salsa downstairs?

283
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:33,126
Oh, I didn't get to the store.

284
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,123
But you could go.

285
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,974
And you said you needed
your basketball shorts,

286
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,413
so I put them in the laundry.

287
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,570
- Right. Thank you, babe.
- But I didn't get to it.

288
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,650
So you're going to need to do a load.

289
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:45,809
A load?

290
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:49,643
And your bathroom needs cleaning,
so I left the stuff in the hall.

291
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,173
And when you're done
with the rubber gloves,

292
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:53,410
just remember to turn them inside out.

293
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:54,803
Bye.

294
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,886
Something's wrong with your mom.

295
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,492
This is really nice.

296
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,491
I've never actually been
on a sailboat before.

297
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,127
Hey, I'd be fine

298
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:10,211
if I never set foot on solid ground again.

299
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,802
You know, I bet I'd really love it
if we ever left the dock.

300
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,003
Well, yeah!

301
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:15,852
But to actually take you out on the water
on a first date

302
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:17,487
would be very forward of me, Paula.

303
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,969
Well, so far I must say
I'm very impressed.

304
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,654
Beautiful setting, a simple meal...

305
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,885
I assume this technique
has worked in the past?

306
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,686
Yes, ma'am, it has.

307
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,049
Is it working now?

308
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,130
You know what? It kind of is.

309
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,693
Let's go for a walk.

310
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,805
But I'm not done with lunch.

311
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,333
Yeah, you are.

312
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,213
Seriously, I'm not one of those girls
who don't eat. I want...

313
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,653
I wanted all of that.

314
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:47,890
See, technically, this is not my boat.

315
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,574
Actually, it's not my boat in any way.

316
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,409
- What?
- I'm a boat broker. I sell boats.

317
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,970
I would love to own a boat like this,
but it's not the right time in my life.

318
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:59,369
Besides, the guy
who does own this boat

319
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,132
is right behind you.

320
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:04,606
Hey there, Mr Axelrod!
I thought you were out of town!

321
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,725
Well, I was, and now I'm not.

322
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:10,093
What's going on? Is that a fork?
Are you eating on my boat?

323
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:11,203
No.

324
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,212
When did you redo the galley?

325
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:17,643
Oh, you're in the market?

326
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,651
Might be. What's she draw?

327
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:21,093
Seven-three.

328
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,933
Cherry's a little dark.

329
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:24,733
The wife picked it.

330
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:26,213
It's got nice lines.

331
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:27,813
She's fast, too.

332
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:30,406
Well, she certainly is yare.

333
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,925
I'll think about it. Thanks for your time.

334
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,453
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:36,643
Thank you.

336
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,446
You're gonna let her walk away?

337
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,849
I'm giving her space, Mr Axelrod.

338
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,083
Now,

339
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,125
I'm going after her.

340
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:56,453
Excuse me, ma'am.
"She certainly is yare"?

341
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:57,802
<i>Philadelphia Story.</i>

342
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,003
Sweet.

343
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:03,203
All right, assuming
that pretending to own a yacht

344
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:06,610
was a brilliant, romantic,
yet ultimately flawed idea,

345
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,850
how do you see the rest of the date
playing out?

346
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:13,013
I don't know. I'm so hungry I can't think.
Seagulls ate my lunch.

347
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,768
What if I take you to a restaurant?

348
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,373
Are you gonna pretend to own it?

349
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,531
No. All the restaurants I own
are in Europe.

350
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,210
Well, hey there, Ace.
Glad you could make it, man.

351
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,369
We thought you went home.

352
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:33,804
I fell into a deep, dark crevasse.
I was so scared.

353
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:35,808
Did you go out with La-Z-Girl?

354
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,925
Paula. I did. We had lunch.

355
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,487
Will there be a second date?

356
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,127
There will be a second date.

357
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:43,131
Yet the relationship
is doomed to failure.

358
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:45,529
Right. And why are we doomed?

359
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,247
You live with your parents?

360
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,329
He's right.

361
00:17:49,454 --> 00:17:52,730
Your entire life is set up perfectly
for ending relationships.

362
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:53,923
We've been out one time.

363
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,329
She's a nice girl, I'm a nice guy,
we had fun.

364
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,445
And I must tell you, son,

365
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,764
nothing is doomed.

366
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:28,767
Gnarly crash!

367
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,368
What are you doing?

368
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,689
Remember, we're the visitors here.

369
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:39,523
Come on.

370
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,254
- Wow. You're feeding it a little peanut?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,330
He gets that stuff all the time, man.

372
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,003
This is what he wants.

373
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,852
You want a treat from the big city, boy?

374
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,771
He's not a child, Tripp.

375
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,168
Look how peaceful he is.

376
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:53,363
Come here, little boy.

377
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,564
You want a little bit of chocolate,
baby-boo-boo?

378
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:56,843
You're giving him a PowerBar?

379
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,532
Everybody loves chocolate.

380
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,733
Tripp, he's saying no.

381
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,082
Look into my eyes.

382
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:03,647
He's saying no, Tripp.

383
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:09,614
Tripp? Tripp? Dude?

384
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,888
Get off!

385
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,492
What is he doing? Is that a squirrel?

386
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:21,933
No, it's a chipmunk.

387
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:26,853
Watch the bike.

388
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,884
Oh, hey. I'm Tripp.

389
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:40,287
You must be Kit.

390
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:44,973
It's a mockingbird.

391
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,129
Who did what?

392
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:47,573
It's a mockingbird.

393
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:48,888
What is?

394
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:51,653
You don't hear that?
That annoying noise.

395
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:53,612
Oh, yeah, now I hear it.

396
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,723
I looked it up.

397
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,766
They can imitate car alarms,
and telephones, and other birds.

398
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,691
I called Animal Control,
and you know what they said?

399
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,363
They said I should just enjoy
one of nature's most talented singers.

400
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,371
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna kill it.

401
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:08,413
Okay, I'm all set.

402
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,008
- Oh, wow.
- Hi.

403
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,328
Wow, look at you.

404
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:12,728
Well, look at you.

405
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:14,213
Sweet shoes.

406
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,972
Really? Thanks.

407
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:19,129
Okay, well, Kit, we're gonna go.
See you.

408
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:20,607
- You ready?
- Yeah.

409
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,292
Okay, you two kids have a blast.

410
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:25,167
- Thanks.
- Hey, Kit, good luck with the...

411
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,846
It's a chipmunk bite.

412
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:36,488
I figured.
Obviously not a normal chipmunk.

413
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:37,603
You're right about that.

414
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:41,886
No, this was like a big, oversized, like,
bobcat, grizzly-bear chipmunk.

415
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,171
I'm pretty fortunate to still be here.

416
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,363
- Wow.
- Yeah.

417
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,449
What did the doctor say?

418
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:47,609
I didn't need to see a doctor.

419
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,248
I had some cream at home
that I put on it.

420
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,330
- You had chipmunk cream?
- Yeah.

421
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:53,967
- Wow, that's lucky.
- Isn't it?

422
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,533
I take it you like Japanese food.

423
00:20:57,654 --> 00:20:58,882
Oh, I love it.

424
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,289
I'm also gonna order a huge dessert,
drink too much,

425
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:03,166
and maybe talk about my old boyfriends.

426
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,773
- Yeah?
- Does that intimidate you?

427
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:06,122
Not at all.

428
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:08,049
Cheers, Paula.

429
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:09,289
Cheers.

430
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:16,087
All right, T-R-l-double-P going in
to get a little squid.

431
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,493
Do you need me to help you with that?

432
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,082
I got it. I got it. Look at this, look at this.

433
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:23,488
I admire the confidence.

434
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:25,445
Thank you. I am fairly...

435
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,530
ambidextrous.

436
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,523
Oh, shit.

437
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:33,929
I'm sorry! Excuse me.

438
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,533
Squid's a little bit greasy tonight.

439
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:37,326
Sorry. Yeah.

440
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:38,648
That's not easy to do.

441
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:39,968
I didn't see anything.

442
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:44,327
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do for a living?

443
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,044
I teach special needs kids.

444
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:52,849
- How's the hand?
- It's fine.

445
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:53,929
- Is it throbbing?
- No.

446
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:56,170
Is the medication wearing off?

447
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,293
Gotta scratch.

448
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:01,283
Oh, yeah.

449
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:02,403
Well,

450
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,248
home again.

451
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:06,689
Home again.

452
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:07,883
I had a nice time.

453
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:08,969
I did, too.

454
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,209
Good.

455
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:11,489
I had fun.

456
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:12,603
Good.

457
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,009
Shut up!
Shut up you crazy bastard bird bitch!

458
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:20,168
Hey, Kit!

459
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,723
What? Hi.

460
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,087
Can you guys see me?

461
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:25,169
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

462
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,886
Oh. Great.

463
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:30,043
What?

464
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:32,092
Dinner and a show.

465
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,408
Good night.

466
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,014
Good night.

467
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:42,125
Now, what type of a boat
do you see yourself in?

468
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:43,403
Well, I'm not sure.

469
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:45,570
But I do know that I need
to be out in the open sea.

470
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:47,571
Well, you gotta ask yourself
some questions.

471
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,207
Do you like speed?

472
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,405
Do you like to hear
the roar of an engine?

473
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:54,287
Do you want to get from point A
to point B as quickly as possible?

474
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,211
If that turns you on,
then you want a powerboat.

475
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,053
Okay, that's it. That's it.
Power. That's me. Yes.

476
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,369
Well, that's one way to go.
But maybe you want to slow down.

477
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,291
You know, listen to the wind
and the water.

478
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,723
Have sunrise and sunset
as your only clock.

479
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:07,492
Know that you could go
around the world

480
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,650
on less than a tank of gas.

481
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:14,322
Now, if that sounds good to you,
then maybe you're sailors.

482
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:16,843
This is not a hobby. This...

483
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,289
It's a lifestyle.

484
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,928
Well, now that is passion!

485
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,612
- What has happened to you?
- What's happened to me?

486
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,326
I want to feel the wind.

487
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:25,443
I do not want to feel...

488
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:27,405
I want to make the wind, okay? Look...

489
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:28,683
- Make the wind?
- Yeah. I'm not a sailor.

490
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:30,293
You don't make wind
sitting on a boat in a dock.

491
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:32,689
I'm a power guy. Power.
Like "power boat."

492
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:33,849
- You're a power guy?
- Excuse me.

493
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:36,090
- I want to feel that beneath...
- Guys who drink Kahlua and cream

494
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,966
are not power guys, honey.

495
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,163
Tripp.

496
00:23:41,814 --> 00:23:43,725
Whoa, slow down, slow down, Paula.

497
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:46,129
Mr Fritz was my best friend

498
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,765
since he was a little puppy.

499
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,809
Just a little fur ball.

500
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:56,290
He was too small
to even jump up on the bed

501
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,967
and now he's...

502
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:00,763
He's...

503
00:24:01,494 --> 00:24:03,086
Got a tissue or something?

504
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:07,685
- He saved my life, you know.
- He did?

505
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,693
And now I can't do
anything for him, and I...

506
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,892
Oh, shit.

507
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,965
I'm so glad you're here.

508
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,846
Yeah, of course I am.

509
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:45,290
Can I have a minute alone with him?

510
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:47,849
Thank you.

511
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:49,885
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay.

512
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,563
Thanks, Gretchen.

513
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:00,843
Anytime.

514
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,723
Gosh, Emotional Crisis Day
is so critical.

515
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,890
I cry, he cries.

516
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:07,447
It totally bonds us.

517
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,087
So how long do you think
he's gonna sleep for?

518
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:11,091
Half an hour.
He's only here for some dental work.

519
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,489
Oh. What's his real name, anyway?

520
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:14,603
I don't know.

521
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,770
I just clean their teeth
and chop their balls off.

522
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,525
God, that is so sad.

523
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,133
Yeah, it was a beautiful dog, man.

524
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:27,573
She was devastated.

525
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,969
Well, this is exactly what she needs.
Good choice.

526
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:32,528
- There she is. Hey, Paula.
- Hi.

527
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:35,088
Paula, these are my good friends,
Demo and Ace. Guys, Paula.

528
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:36,283
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

529
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:38,928
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Come on, don't.

530
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,203
Thank you.

531
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,529
- Nice suit. How you doing?
- Thank you. Hi.

532
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:46,887
You know, most guys would've
sent flowers, chocolates maybe,

533
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:50,165
but I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

534
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:52,888
Well, you know,
anybody can send flowers, Paula.

535
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:55,767
Now, I'm going to let you in
on "the" secret.

536
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:58,892
It's called the "finger roll."
Quick fingers, light on the trigger.

537
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,652
See, double trigger...

538
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:04,006
More paintballs in less time
means victory.

539
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:05,328
Let's see it.

540
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:06,523
When you're out there today

541
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:09,487
and you got these paintballs
flying at you at over 200 miles an hour,

542
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:13,163
I guarantee you will not be thinking
about the late, great Mr Fritz.

543
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:16,733
Holy moly. They really move that fast?

544
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,568
Oh, my God!

545
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:22,329
I'm so sorry!

546
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:23,523
Nice shot!

547
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:25,133
- Oh, thanks.
- He's okay.

548
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:31,086
Let's go shoot some strangers, huh?

549
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:40,454
First one to paint the skirt gets a beer.

550
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:44,010
I think that guy just laughed at me.
Who are these guys?

551
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,931
They go by "Devil Babies."

552
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,965
They finished third
in the National Championship.

553
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:49,652
This should be an excellent test
of our skills.

554
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,765
- Wait. These guys are champions?
- All right, all right.

555
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,486
They didn't win it.

556
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:55,809
Go!

557
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:57,369
Move, move, move!

558
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:58,768
Let's go!

559
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:02,213
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

560
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,443
Oh, my God!

561
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:05,485
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

562
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:12,049
There you are! Look alive!

563
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:13,603
I'm out.

564
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:16,727
- Watch out!
- Watch it!

565
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,367
Come on, blondie!

566
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:34,643
Am I out?

567
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,369
I didn't know they sold beer here.

568
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,603
They don't.

569
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:56,172
There you go! Stay down, Paula!
Stay down!

570
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,487
Can I have one?

571
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,129
No.

572
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,369
Check it out!

573
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:16,453
Warm day, huh?

574
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,413
Nice talking to you.

575
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:30,322
Damn it!

576
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:31,929
Paula?

577
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:33,567
Sorry! Sorry!

578
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:35,446
Does it count if it was an accident?

579
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:37,808
Bad finger roll.

580
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,686
All right, I need you to come to me.

581
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:42,567
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
stay over here till it's over.

582
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:43,649
- Now!
- Okay.

583
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:48,929
I'm out.

584
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:52,527
Shit! I'm out!

585
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:55,122
- You will not have died in vain!
- Stay down.

586
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:57,165
Paula, where are you?

587
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,849
Finger roll. Finger roll. Finger roll.

588
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:03,762
Oh, Tinkerbell!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

589
00:29:04,774 --> 00:29:07,334
The sooner you lose,
the sooner you can go shopping!

590
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:11,168
Oh, man!

591
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:13,211
Who's laughing now?

592
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:18,168
You did it!

593
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:20,928
- Get out of here!
- Boy, you made it!

594
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:22,043
Come on!

595
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,323
Where'd that come from?

596
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,973
- Look at you!
- I love it.

597
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:26,368
- Hey, Kit!
- Kind of fun, huh?

598
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:29,008
You know what?
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

599
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:32,409
I take it you're over
your dead golden retriever.

600
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:35,253
You know, if I really had a dog
and he really had died,

601
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,604
I think this would have totally helped.

602
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,929
Man, she's got good spatial awareness.

603
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,169
And great hair!

604
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:42,807
- Thanks.
- She's a keeper, man.

605
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:44,890
She's really great. Really great, Tripp.

606
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,527
So can we go now?

607
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:48,813
Meeting the friends is very important.

608
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,811
Guys need to know
we not only like them,

609
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,765
but we like their friends, too.

610
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,727
Fine. The tall one's kind of cute.
What's he do?

611
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:57,333
Oh, he's some kind of software writer.

612
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:58,967
He works out of his basement,
but he makes a lot of money.

613
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,686
Oh, you know what?
No, that's the little guy.

614
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:03,328
The tall one just got fired from Kinko's.

615
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:06,613
How will I choose?

616
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,167
This is going very well.

617
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:10,330
Good. So we can go now.

618
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:12,726
Not until I get "the nod."

619
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,926
If I don't get "the nod,"
the friends undermine.

620
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,611
I think you're getting "the nod."

621
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:22,923
Oh, yeah.

622
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:25,933
Oh, Tripp is just cruising
through the steps.

623
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:30,172
In fact, I think tomorrow
I'm gonna let him teach me something.

624
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,649
Now, basically there's two ways
to turn a boat.

625
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:47,609
There's "coming about,"
which is turning into the wind,

626
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:49,850
and there's "jibing,"
which is turning away from the wind.

627
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,772
Now, jibing is something that you
never want to do with a rookie onboard,

628
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,566
so let's give it a shot, huh?

629
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:56,969
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why is jibing bad?

630
00:30:57,094 --> 00:30:59,289
It's not bad, it's just fun. Jibe ho!

631
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,370
Come on, babe! Let's get over there!

632
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,087
Come on, boy!

633
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,083
Oh, my God!

634
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:17,851
Nothing like the threat of decapitation
to make it a little more interesting.

635
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:23,126
Make off this sheet, like so.

636
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,043
Okay.

637
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:30,803
"Jibe ho" and "making off the sheet"?

638
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:34,324
That's too many words to learn.
I just want to get a suntan.

639
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:35,769
Here, take the wheel.

640
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,407
What? Really?

641
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,523
Oh, yeah.

642
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:39,609
All right.

643
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,372
- We call it the helm.
- Okay.

644
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:42,813
Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?

645
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,128
I'm going down below.

646
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:45,529
What's down below?

647
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,292
I don't know, beer, wine, chips, rum.

648
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:48,927
I don't know. It's not my boat.

649
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:51,170
But I don't know what I'm doing!
I'm not kidding! Seriously!

650
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:52,488
You're sailing!

651
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,013
What if I hit something?

652
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,851
I think you'll be okay. Fly.

653
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,523
Wow.

654
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:06,169
I'm sailing.

655
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:21,363
Oh, man.

656
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:23,766
That's gorgeous!

657
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,884
You know, I thought going on a boat
was a good idea because you like it,

658
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:40,006
but my God! That was great!

659
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:43,923
You should buy that boat! I mean,
I'm sure it's expensive, but so what?

660
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:47,654
Well, I like that boat, but I really don't...

661
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,049
Nice.

662
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,612
I don't really want a new boat.

663
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:54,646
What I would love
is an old wooden boat.

664
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:58,409
Now, they're a lot more upkeep,
but when you're on one of those,

665
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,373
it's like you're part of something,
you know?

666
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,329
It's like you're connected, you know,
to the original seafaring people

667
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,570
who set sail into the unknown
and said things like,

668
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,685
"Holy crap, that's a big wave!"

669
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,884
So do it. Buy a crummy old boat.

670
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,972
Who cares,
as long as you're out there?

671
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,085
Well, I'm working on it.

672
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:22,448
The thing is, you gotta be ready.
I mean, it's a big commitment.

673
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:24,565
And if you're not ready, you just end up,

674
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:27,367
well, a lonely guy
with a big boat payment.

675
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,446
Who says you have to be Lonely?

676
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,763
- Hey.
- Oh, hey! Hi!

677
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:02,043
I didn't know you were home.

678
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:05,052
Yeah, everyone from work
went to T.G.I. Friday's,

679
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:07,324
but I don't really like that place.

680
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:09,524
- Or anyone I work with.
- Oh, good.

681
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:12,566
So then we can stay in and watch
one of those drinking movies you like.

682
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:13,729
Yeah.

683
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,453
I smell something.

684
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,767
Do you smell something?

685
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:26,242
Oh, Tripp and I had crab today.

686
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,132
No, that's not it.

687
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,846
I smell fun.

688
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,083
What?

689
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,603
You are a dirty little fun-haver.

690
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:40,170
That is absurd.
Tripp is a fascinating case.

691
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:42,649
He doesn't fit the usual profile.

692
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:43,729
Of losers and shut-ins?

693
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:45,845
I actually don't even see
why he still lives at home.

694
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:48,442
He's got a good job,
he's got normal social skills,

695
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:50,610
he's attractive,

696
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,891
he's really sweet.

697
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:59,446
That's so nice that you get to hang out
with such a sweet guy every day.

698
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:07,012
It was a rewarding
and successful work day. That's all.

699
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:08,089
Okay.

700
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:11,729
And at the end of it,
I looked into his eyes,

701
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:13,329
and I saw it.

702
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:15,567
I've got him.

703
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,206
He is as good as moved out.

704
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:23,042
It's over. She's gotta go.

705
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:24,323
You're dumping Paula?

706
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,843
- What happened?
- Same thing that always happens.

707
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:28,373
Everything is going along
nice and smooth,

708
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,483
we're having a good time,

709
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:31,969
and all of a sudden, out of nowhere...

710
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:33,323
She gets serious.

711
00:35:33,454 --> 00:35:37,003
I hate to say it, boys,
but it is time to take the girl home.

712
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,772
- You're doing it again.
- What?

713
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:42,648
The thing where the woman gets close
and you pull the relationship ripcord.

714
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,049
Guys, it's simple. The fun's gone.

715
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,011
Hey, guys, check this out!

716
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,963
Hey, boy!

717
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,764
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.

718
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,128
What's he saying, Demo?

719
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:00,809
Where'd you go?

720
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:01,923
Where'd he go?

721
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:04,124
- Let me ask you something, Demo.
- Yeah.

722
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:06,722
How's this surfing
if there are no waves?

723
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:10,483
Tripp?

724
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:17,729
Should we go after him?

725
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:18,923
Well, he's their passenger now.

726
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:22,091
Passenger?
He just took him underwater!

727
00:36:22,774 --> 00:36:23,968
Take me!

728
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:28,523
Oh, shit!

729
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:31,369
Oh, shit! The son of a bitch bit me!

730
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,244
So you were bit by a dolphin?

731
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:39,366
Yeah. And not just any dolphin, either.

732
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:42,008
This was a great white dolphin,
all right?

733
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:44,492
I'm lucky to still be here.

734
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:50,849
What?

735
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:54,289
Nothing.

736
00:36:58,294 --> 00:36:59,283
Wow!

737
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,652
- This is your house?
- Yeah.

738
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:03,571
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

739
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,523
I like to come home to a nice place.

740
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,730
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

741
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:14,732
- It's very pretty.
- Thank you.

742
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:16,492
- You want something to drink?
- Yeah, sure.

743
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,013
Beer? Glass of wine?

744
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:19,647
- Sure, wine would be great, thanks.
- Glass of wine.

745
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,729
Thanks.

746
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:23,607
Hey, Mom, Pop,
I thought y'all were going out.

747
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:27,363
Out? What would we go out for?
We've got those brand-new chairs!

748
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:30,123
Hello.

749
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:36,168
Tripp, who's your little friend?

750
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:37,693
Mom, Dad, this is Paula.

751
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:41,170
Paula, this is my mom, my dad,
Sue and Al.

752
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:43,849
Wow! Well!

753
00:37:43,974 --> 00:37:45,612
- Hello. How do you do?
- Hello.

754
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:46,803
Hi.

755
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:49,485
It's a great pleasure to meet you both.

756
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:50,842
Hi, Paula.

757
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:53,723
Wow.

758
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:01,483
So you...

759
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:03,692
You live with your parents.

760
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:08,042
Is that a problem?

761
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,213
No.

762
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:18,888
Not for me.

763
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:22,285
Would you like to stay for dinner?

764
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:25,326
Oh! Wow. I'd love to. Thank you.

765
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:26,603
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

766
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:30,170
Well, it smells good,
and I'm really hungry. Aren't you?

767
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:33,331
Yeah, I'm hungry.
But my mom here, she's cooking dinner.

768
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:34,853
Like she does most nights.

769
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:36,606
Right here, where I live,

770
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:37,883
with them,

771
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,164
in the same house I grew up in.

772
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:43,133
That's nice.

773
00:38:44,374 --> 00:38:46,092
I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

774
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:47,932
Well, we're about to sit down...

775
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:50,124
Might mow the neighbour's, too.

776
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,613
Is this really okay? 'Cause I don't want
to intrude on family time.

777
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,929
Oh, it's fine. I'll set another place.

778
00:38:57,054 --> 00:38:58,407
Okay, thanks.

779
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,086
I'm gonna go help Dad.

780
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:03,923
Is there...

781
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,247
Is there anything I can do to help?

782
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,604
Listen, I am so sorry.

783
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:11,965
I had no idea that he was
going to bring me over here.

784
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:14,370
But you are doing great.

785
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:17,493
[Skipped item nr. 785]

786
00:39:17,494 --> 00:39:19,724
But that strict programme of yours?

787
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,290
You're gonna have to start deviating.

788
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:23,563
He's breaking up with you.

789
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,683
What?

790
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,089
The only reason
he ever brings girls home to meet us

791
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:28,932
is 'cause he's getting ready
to dump them.

792
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,123
Really?

793
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:32,849
Well,

794
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:34,649
that's not happening.

795
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:41,167
- Hey, Paula? Hey, sweetie?
- Yes?

796
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:44,650
I appreciate you staying
for dinner, all right?

797
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:46,253
And I know that must have been
very awkward.

798
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,568
Not at all.

799
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:48,888
Not at all?

800
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:55,409
You don't mind that my parents
are downstairs right now?

801
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:57,286
They're asleep in their chairs.

802
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:00,083
Don't stare.

803
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:03,567
I'm paying for it. I'll stare if I want to.

804
00:40:07,454 --> 00:40:09,649
I'm just saying, you know, they might...

805
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:11,726
They might hear us.

806
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:14,573
Why? Are you a screamer?

807
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:49,803
Paula?

808
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:55,886
Hey, you're up! Wow, early risers.

809
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:58,653
Hey, listen.
FYI, work-wise, we're definitely on track.

810
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:00,173
Things are good. Tripp is good.

811
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,852
Well, actually, he's fantastic.

812
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:04,090
Of course, I don't need to tell you that.
You're his parents.

813
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:08,173
I'm just trying to say, you should be
very proud of him.

814
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:10,363
Well...

815
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,806
You got a lovely home.

816
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,297
I'm sorry, miss, you're not allowed
to eat that in the store.

817
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,409
Fine.

818
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,178
I need to buy a gun.
How much is this big gun here?

819
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,849
That's a 12-gauge shotgun.
That's a pretty powerful weapon.

820
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,379
You know, for a woman your size,

821
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,730
I'd probably recommend something
a little, you know...

822
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,815
More compact?

823
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,932
So I just point, and then I squeeze
the trigger and then boom.

824
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,654
Yeah. What did you say
you were shooting?

825
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,295
Twelve hundred bucks? Wow.
How much are the bullets for this?

826
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,689
Shells. Shotguns use shells.
Anyway. Whatever.

827
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,697
They're 15 bucks for a box of 25.

828
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,459
Okay, I don't need a whole box.
I just need...

829
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,895
one.

830
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,729
You know,

831
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,651
I get sad sometimes, too.

832
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,449
So many pressures in life, you know?

833
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,177
Can I give you a phone number
for some people who can help...

834
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,733
Oh, no.

835
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,088
It's like a hotline.

836
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,451
Listen, sunshine, I'm not

837
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,093
- suicidal.
- No, I know.

838
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,690
I just have a problem
with a mockingbird.

839
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,288
Okay,

840
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,378
- you can't kill a mockingbird.
- Why not?

841
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,219
Well, for one, there's the book
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

842
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,298
A copy of that, too, right here.

843
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,413
No, it's not a manual
on how to kill mockingbirds.

844
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,691
It's a classic American novel.
How do you not know this?

845
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,098
I know a lot of other things.
Give me the gun!

846
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,175
- No!
- Yes!

847
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,494
I'm not gonna sell you this gun.

848
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,498
Mockingbirds are protected under
the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

849
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,655
Killing one is a crime.

850
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,418
Look, this is insane.

851
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,899
I have rights, too, you know.

852
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,250
Or maybe you haven't heard
of the Sixth Amendment!

853
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,769
The right to a speedy and public trial?

854
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,337
You. You're on my list,

855
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,529
Jim.

856
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,970
I got great boat shoes.

857
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,055
Hi.

858
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,937
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

859
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,528
I got shoes for the next time
Tripp and I go sailing.

860
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,298
And they're not just cute.

861
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,773
Tripp says they're actually
very practical.

862
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,128
They have these little ridges
on the bottom...

863
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,330
Wait, wait, wait, slow down. Look at me.

864
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,177
- What happened last night?
- What happened last night?

865
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,138
I tried to end it.

866
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,092
Tried, as in "you failed"?

867
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,255
Yeah.

868
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,370
But the sex was fantastic.

869
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,172
You had sex with him?

870
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,939
This is not a big deal.

871
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,575
What was that rule that you had about
never ever having sex with clients?

872
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,612
Oh, yeah,
"I never ever have sex with my clients."

873
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,652
Those are my rules.
I can change them if I need to.

874
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,577
It's not like I don't know what I'm doing.

875
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,849
So your parents weren't home?

876
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,618
No, they were downstairs.

877
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,458
- And you were upstairs?
- Yeah.

878
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,816
Look, I am still in control.

879
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,774
This was a one-time
emergency situation.

880
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,413
You know what? It's very complicated.

881
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,418
I don't have time right now
to explain to you how business works.

882
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,213
You don't need to explain to me
how business works. I'm not an idiot.

883
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,534
Do you know that I have a contract?

884
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,336
I have fiduciary responsibilities
to uphold.

885
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,133
From a fiduciary standpoint,
would you say that you had an orgasm?

886
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,251
Come on! Were we talking to you?

887
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,449
No. Clean that mess up.

888
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,174
Hey, hey! Hey. Can we please
discuss this someplace else?

889
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,180
That's okay, you guys can stay here
if you want.

890
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,328
What are you gonna do now?

891
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,529
I don't know.

892
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,095
I'm in uncharted waters here, boys.

893
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,654
My mom thinks it's her dog,
but I do all the work.

894
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,099
I mean, you don't brush an Irish setter...

895
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,017
- You have an Irish setter?
- Yeah!

896
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,289
I have a yellow Lab!

897
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,092
I mean, he's getting kind of old,

898
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,892
but we should definitely
get them together.

899
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,294
We should...

900
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,652
God, I'm so lucky. I mean, I'm so lucky.

901
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,658
I mean, look at you, and look at me.

902
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,771
Hey, I mean, come on, look at you.

903
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,494
You're smart, you're attractive,

904
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,975
you love the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy,

905
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,376
because it's all about
storytelling, and myth,

906
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,491
before CGI ruined everything.

907
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,418
I mean, come on, what girl
wouldn't want to be with you?

908
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,132
A shocking number, actually.

909
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,534
Well, you know what? It's their loss.

910
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,013
You show me a guy who loves <i>Empire</i>

911
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,132
and I will show you a guy
who's not afraid of his imagination.

912
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,531
Like with Luke gets to the cave,
and he asks Yoda what's in there,

913
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,093
and Yoda says...

914
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,333
"Only what you take with you."

915
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,819
But he goes in anyway, because
he is not afraid of his own mind!

916
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,056
Walking the path of the Jedi, that's why.

917
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,536
That's you! You're Luke!

918
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,689
I gotta pee.

919
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,209
Didn't you just go?

920
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,932
Listen, listen, I'll be right back.

921
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,533
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

922
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,809
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

923
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,975
All right, cool.

924
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,417
But, really, don't go anywhere.

925
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,569
Hiya, Paula.

926
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,689
Oh, God!

927
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,935
Shit!

928
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,770
You scared the crap out of me.

929
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,251
What you doing?
This isn't your usual place, is it?

930
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,500
Just, you know, just...

931
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,618
having lunch with a friend.

932
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,775
You always hold your friends' hands?

933
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,651
Like, then I touched...
We touched hand.

934
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,213
I just touched his hand.

935
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,331
Well, my friends never touch my hands.

936
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,210
You've put me
in a very difficult position here.

937
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,498
Okay, look, what do you want?

938
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,215
No.

939
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,808
It's just coffee.
You don't have to marry him.

940
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,579
First of all,
that's the geeky computer guy.

941
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,533
It's bad enough I have to go out
with a loser who still lives with his mom,

942
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,289
but you led me to believe that it was
the handsome minimum-wage slacker.

943
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,533
No, I don't think that I did that.

944
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,933
Okay, I didn't have a choice.

945
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,049
He was going to tell Tripp

946
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,216
and you were the only
bargaining chip that I had.

947
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,898
You should take that as a compliment.

948
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,169
He's a troll.

949
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,416
He's not a troll. He's... He's...

950
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,736
He's endearing, and quirky.

951
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,573
Oh, for Christ's sake.

952
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,014
I'm coming!

953
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,569
Damn it.

954
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,209
I hope you like fish.

955
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,298
So how does Paula do it, anyway?

956
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,012
It seems like it would be hard on her.

957
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,290
Does she ever get it confused
with her real life?

958
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,093
What makes you think
she has a real life?

959
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,370
It's just kind of a weird job.

960
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,611
I mean, how does one
get into that field?

961
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,616
A couple of years ago, she fell for a guy

962
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,651
who wouldn't move out
of his parents' house.

963
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,850
I don't know, I guess
because she couldn't fix him,

964
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,130
she has to fix
all the other losers out there.

965
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,535
No offence.

966
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,455
None taken.

967
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,177
Listen, if you want to go, that's okay.

968
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,536
I'm sorry I slammed the door
in your face.

969
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,651
I don't sleep much.

970
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,015
Really?

971
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,689
Me, either.

972
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,133
Just have too much stuff going on
in my head. Is that the same thing?

973
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,375
No, no.

974
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,617
No. No. I want to sleep,

975
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,015
but I can't, because there's a bird
outside my window

976
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,700
and all night long it chirps,
and it chirps, and it chirps,

977
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,209
and it's annoying,
and I can't get it to shut up!

978
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,419
I have a BB gun.

979
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,892
Go, Omaha!

980
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,529
Yeah.

981
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,977
Say, did you get my message today?

982
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,368
No. You know what,
I had my phone turned off.

983
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,219
I was having lunch with a girlfriend.

984
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,975
My teacher, Miss Kramer,
has a girlfriend.

985
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,694
Oh! That's nice.

986
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,855
She's a lesbian.

987
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,452
Well, don't act all cool about it!

988
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,339
You're jealous 'cause you like her.

989
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,735
You're the one
who was always staring at her shirt.

990
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,615
He's lying.

991
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,019
I don't hear anything.

992
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,009
He'll come.

993
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,853
He always comes.

994
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,972
How many times did you pump it?

995
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,052
- Twice.
- Good.

996
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,934
'Cause we don't want to kill it,
just sting it so it flies away.

997
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,329
Yeah.

998
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,774
So, is Kit short for Katherine?

999
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,489
Yes. Is Ace short for

1000
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,659
Ace-a-rooney?

1001
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,612
No, it's a nickname.

1002
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,935
What, are you really good at cards
or something?

1003
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,848
Until I was 10,
I had an undescended testicle.

1004
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,009
Wait!

1005
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,929
There you are.

1006
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,418
Say good night, birdie.

1007
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,215
I got him!

1008
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,010
You pumped it more than twice,
didn't you?

1009
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,694
Oh, my God!
God, why'd you make me do that?

1010
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,053
- Clear the table!
- Oh, God!

1011
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,972
- Oh, my God! Is he okay?
- I don't know.

1012
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,215
- Where's he hit?
- I don't know!

1013
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,932
- Is he dead?
- I...

1014
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,015
Oh, no!

1015
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,418
Look! Look! The BB.

1016
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,736
Well, maybe it's just stunned.
Do you know CPR?

1017
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,088
- Well, yeah, but...
- Do it!

1018
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,529
- It's a bird!
- Do it!

1019
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,857
Okay. Check vitals. Where's the pulse?

1020
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,979
- Gently.
- Open the airway.

1021
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,932
- Don't hurt him!
- I'm not hurting him!

1022
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,015
God!

1023
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,489
Okay. Be careful with him.

1024
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,609
- He's little.
- I don't know.

1025
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,208
Oh, my God, it's not working!
He's going!

1026
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,012
Do something! We're losing him!

1027
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,255
Not on my watch!

1028
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,458
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.

1029
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,138
Walk away from the light, little buddy!

1030
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,771
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand!

1031
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,935
Please, God!

1032
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,136
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! He's alive!

1033
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,935
What the...

1034
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,774
I'm hungry.

1035
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,654
Captain, you just had nachos,
two hot dogs, and a bag of peanuts.

1036
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,851
I didn't have ice cream.

1037
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,379
My bad.

1038
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,853
Fine. Can I have a fruit bar?

1039
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,935
Now you're getting good.

1040
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,778
That's good, little negotiator here.
All right.

1041
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,089
Hey, wait for me.

1042
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,376
Let's check with Miss Paula,
see if she needs anything.

1043
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,253
Maybe a Royal's Number One
foam finger.

1044
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,733
Don't come back without a foam finger.

1045
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,975
You got it.

1046
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,417
Tripp and Jeffrey are very cute together,
aren't they?

1047
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,610
- Yeah. Listen, while we have a minute,
- Yeah?

1048
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,093
...I really want to talk to you
about the whole

1049
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,017
dating-my-best-friend-for-money thing.

1050
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,253
- What?
- So, this must be the date

1051
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,655
where you show that you share
the guy's intense passion for something

1052
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,577
that, really, you don't have
the slightest interest in.

1053
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,296
Okay, look, I don't know
what you heard, but...

1054
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,569
Ace told me everything.

1055
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,936
Don't worry, I haven't ratted you out.

1056
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,455
Truth is, I support your overall goal.

1057
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,538
But if you really want to help him,
and I think you do,

1058
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,139
you have to have all the facts.

1059
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,814
Starting with the fact
that Jeffrey's not Tripp's nephew.

1060
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,455
You ever heard of Amy?

1061
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,577
Amy is... He's Amy's son.

1062
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,812
Amy is Tripp's first love,
and she died six years ago.

1063
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,658
He never told you that, did he?

1064
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,848
Oh, my God!

1065
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,378
I am the worst person in the world.

1066
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,018
Oh, hey, you're home. Great.

1067
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,895
I have to break up with Tripp.
I'm terminating my contract, and...

1068
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,575
I can't do it.

1069
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,848
What happened in here?

1070
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,299
Nothing. I tripped.

1071
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,299
Go on with your story.

1072
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,012
Oh. Well,

1073
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,618
Tripp was engaged.

1074
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,895
- Okay.
- And you know Jeffrey, his nephew?

1075
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,337
He's not his nephew.
He's not related to him at all.

1076
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,378
Jeffrey is a boy whose mother
was gonna marry Tripp,

1077
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,769
and she died.

1078
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,939
That's so sad.

1079
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,413
God, I know.

1080
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,658
Who gives a shit?

1081
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,848
I beg your pardon?

1082
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,653
Seriously. I've never heard you
talk this way about a client before.

1083
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,213
I don't know why you're whining
about this one.

1084
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,375
Because...

1085
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,569
He's been through an actual tragedy!

1086
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,136
This is about Tripp not being
an appropriate client.

1087
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,091
It's an ethical problem.

1088
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,889
Who's that?

1089
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,375
What?

1090
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,569
In...

1091
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,219
Oh! In...

1092
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,489
That's Phillip.

1093
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,539
Who's Phillip?

1094
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,213
Phillip's...

1095
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,574
I... Oh!

1096
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,135
Hi, ladies.

1097
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,178
Did I say that you could come out?

1098
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,096
Well, well, well, well, well.

1099
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,328
He's nice.

1100
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,779
That's nice.

1101
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,175
Look, I don't see
why it's so complicated.

1102
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,416
You like Tripp. Tell Tripp you like him.

1103
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,368
<i>I gotta tell you something.</i>

1104
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,253
I told Paula about Amy.

1105
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,456
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What...

1106
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,569
Why?

1107
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,894
You were never going to.

1108
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,738
You never even say her name.

1109
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,654
Amy was his ex-fiancée.
She died about six years ago.

1110
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,340
To lose love is greatest pain of all.

1111
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,495
That's right.

1112
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,372
It's okay to cry. We'll turn around.

1113
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,933
I'm fine, guys.

1114
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,295
Dude.

1115
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,852
You had no right to do that, man.
That's my life.

1116
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,453
You're right, you're right.
And, normally...

1117
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,332
I believe everybody
needs to walk their own path,

1118
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,020
but just you're not walking yours. Okay?

1119
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,051
You're sitting near the path, on a rock.

1120
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,449
This was the only thing I could do,
given the circumstances.

1121
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,979
Circumstances?

1122
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,697
Brings up the other thing I gotta tell you.

1123
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,456
I feel a little bit bad
because I kind of implied to Paula

1124
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,729
that I wouldn't say anything, but...

1125
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,771
Deception's a poison.
It's like margarine.

1126
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,889
I can't have that in my body.

1127
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,011
God damn it, Demo, get to the point.
Come on.

1128
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,576
Your parents hired Paula to date you
so that you'd move out of their house.

1129
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,372
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

1130
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,571
They're paying her to be your girlfriend.

1131
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,894
- Paula?
- Yeah.

1132
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,659
But she's a professional interventionist.
It's her job.

1133
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,775
You know?

1134
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,898
You're telling me it's not real?

1135
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,695
No. No, it's real! It's very real!

1136
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,219
Okay, you're upset right now.

1137
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,729
I want to encourage you to see past
that bottomless sense of betrayal.

1138
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,452
Focus on the future, okay?

1139
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,979
'Cause I think you guys
could work things out.

1140
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,455
I mean it.
I think you crazy kids have a shot.

1141
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,090
So you came home
and he was cooking?

1142
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,255
Yeah.

1143
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,775
Strange.

1144
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,058
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

1145
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,489
- Smells good.
- I know!

1146
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,815
Can you get that?

1147
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,094
Hi. I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here.

1148
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,529
Listen, we didn't, either. Come on in.

1149
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,615
Okay. Thank you.

1150
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,059
Tripp's in the kitchen.

1151
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,973
That does, too.

1152
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,609
All right!

1153
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,289
Tripp?

1154
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,975
Hey, there's my girl. Come here, you.

1155
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,132
Hey, what's going on?

1156
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,012
Got a little family dinner.

1157
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,413
All the people that I care about the most

1158
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,815
together in one room. Good times.

1159
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,214
Hey.

1160
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,132
Listen, can we talk?

1161
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,216
Absolutely. There's gonna be
plenty of time to talk over dinner.

1162
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,092
But right now, I'm cooking.

1163
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,970
Mom, Pop, you want some more <i>vino?</i>

1164
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,849
That's good, that's good.

1165
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,732
Oh, just a little bit more
for the y-o-u, babe.

1166
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,368
Tripp, I don't know what to say.

1167
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,570
Oh, Mom, will you knock that talk off?

1168
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,696
I made this beautiful dinner tonight

1169
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,291
to say thank you
to the people that I love the most.

1170
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,092
All of you.

1171
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,488
I'm truly blessed.

1172
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,259
Mom. Pop. Sweetie.

1173
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,736
- That's good, Son.
- Cheers.

1174
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,289
Dig in!

1175
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,928
Hang on. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I'm too excited.

1176
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,732
I have an announcement to make here.

1177
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,889
Okay.

1178
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,008
Paula,

1179
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,979
the last couple of weeks

1180
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,690
that I've spent with you have been

1181
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,048
amazing,

1182
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,094
surprising,

1183
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,175
joyful,

1184
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,414
surprising.

1185
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,056
I can honestly say that, because of you,

1186
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,894
I've experienced emotions
that I didn't even know I had.

1187
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,293
So call me crazy,

1188
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,969
but I think

1189
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,659
we should move in together.

1190
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,214
That's my boy!

1191
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,699
You okay, baby? Want some water?

1192
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,849
Thank you.

1193
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,972
That's wonderful news.

1194
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,018
I am so proud of you, Son.

1195
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,290
Right? And the thing is, Mom, Dad,

1196
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,969
I've lived upstairs since I was three,
and it's been great.

1197
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,450
All right? You two are the best parents
that a boy could ever ask for.

1198
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,095
I mean, I can only hope that I'm going
to be able to give my kids,

1199
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,769
our kids,

1200
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,890
half of the love, the respect,

1201
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,011
the understanding, the support,

1202
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,892
that you two have given me.

1203
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,738
I guess what I'm saying is,
it is time for Tripp

1204
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,653
to spread his wings.

1205
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,929
Wow.

1206
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,089
Well...

1207
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,819
Well, this is very unexpected.

1208
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,259
So here's the plan, all right?

1209
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,972
We're going to blow out
the east wall of my bedroom,

1210
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,328
enlarge the bathroom,

1211
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,578
and basically turn the entire upstairs
into a secondary master suite

1212
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,657
so there's room for the both of us,

1213
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,369
and the both of you,

1214
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,489
under the same roof.

1215
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,735
What do you say?

1216
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,377
I'm not understanding.
You want Paula to move in here?

1217
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,536
Yes! It's the perfect solution.

1218
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,379
Mom, Dad, you like her.
Paula, you like them.

1219
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,334
We're all gonna be right here together
under one roof, a big happy family.

1220
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,337
I'm telling you,
I'm getting really excited about this.

1221
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,575
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait just a second.

1222
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,139
Take a deep breath here and...

1223
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,376
Tripp, Tripp, I just think
that we should probably talk about this.

1224
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,138
Just 'cause it's a big idea, and...

1225
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,410
Honey, I've given this
a lot of thought, all right? It'll work!

1226
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,858
And the best part about it is, Mom, Dad,

1227
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,418
you won't have to keep paying Paula
to be my girlfriend.

1228
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,456
What, did I say something wrong?
Come on.

1229
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,218
You're all getting what you wanted.

1230
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,017
Paula, you don't have to pretend
to like me anymore.

1231
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,411
And, Mom, Dad,
you wanted me out of the house.

1232
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,249
I'm out.

1233
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,253
Tripp, wait! Tripp!

1234
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,375
Tripp!

1235
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,773
I don't want to hear it.

1236
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,494
Come on, Tripp.

1237
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,768
Please, you don't understand.

1238
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,493
You're right. Now hold on.

1239
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,816
I don't know what your daily rate is,

1240
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,818
but that's everything
I've got in my wallet. There's $300.

1241
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,339
Oh, come on, Tripp!

1242
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,577
It should be good for tonight,
especially since we didn't have sex.

1243
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,975
Please, Tripp, let me just explain to you.

1244
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,818
Get the fuck out of my car.

1245
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,499
Oh, God.

1246
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,257
So your parents gave her money.

1247
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,371
My grandparents
give my baby-sitter money

1248
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,455
and I still like her.

1249
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:21,174
Well, good for you, Captain.
Hey, can we talk about something else?

1250
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,655
Fine. The 32 is nice.

1251
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,615
But I think I see myself more in a 37.

1252
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,255
What do you think?

1253
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,939
Don't buy a boat, dude.

1254
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,971
I love... boats.

1255
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,370
No, you don't love boats.

1256
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,253
You love the idea of a boat.

1257
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,412
But the reality is,

1258
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,771
they're just a drain on your time,
your wallet, and your emotions.

1259
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,251
And in the end,
she will break your heart.

1260
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,290
<i>You see, because no matter how much</i>
<i>you care for her,</i>

1261
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,569
<i>she's got no feelings for you.</i>

1262
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,055
<i>I mean, look at her, she's a boat.</i>
<i>She's wood.</i>

1263
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,010
<i>So forget buying a boat.</i>
<i>You want to feel pain?</i>

1264
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,696
You're better off
slamming your hand in a car door.

1265
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,650
You see, that's the stuff that screams,
"I live with my mother."

1266
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,612
- What?
- I mean it.

1267
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,332
I'm telling you as a friend.

1268
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,576
You bring that weak stuff
to the playground,

1269
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,099
you won't last 10 minutes.

1270
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,300
Thank you very much for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

1271
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,812
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, no, no, thank you.

1272
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,692
No, I just want to give you this.

1273
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,132
- What is it?
- It's your money.

1274
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,690
I'm returning it.
I know it doesn't fix anything.

1275
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,378
I know that nothing can,

1276
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,492
but given the circumstances,
I don't feel good keeping it, so...

1277
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,729
Really, please take it.

1278
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,335
Okay.

1279
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,169
What?

1280
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,256
This has never happened before.
I want you to know that.

1281
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,814
He seemed like an open-and-shut case.

1282
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,379
I guess I was overly confident.

1283
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,973
I don't know. And he...

1284
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,328
He won't return
any of my phone calls, and I...

1285
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,130
I keep replaying it over and over
in my mind. I just...

1286
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,852
I don't know where I...

1287
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,292
You're in love with our son.

1288
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,696
Hey, come on, we're gonna go
rock climbing. Get in the car.

1289
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,809
No.

1290
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,052
You've been moping around here
for two weeks.

1291
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,295
Come on, get in.

1292
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,735
Nah.

1293
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,851
Tripp! Come on, it's unlocked.

1294
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,130
It wants you to get in.
Come on. Get in the car, Tripp.

1295
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,972
Isn't this great, guys?

1296
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,012
How you doing up there, Tripp?

1297
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,290
- You feeling it?
- Yeah, baby.

1298
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,058
This is a nice rock.

1299
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,457
- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

1300
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,299
Doing good. This is having fun.
Aren't we?

1301
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,011
You guys want any carrots?

1302
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,890
Tripp, you should call Paula.

1303
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,015
- She wants to see you.
- That's enough, Demo!

1304
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,379
A little slack, Ace!

1305
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,729
Here you go.

1306
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,414
Belay on.

1307
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,858
You know, she's hurting, too.

1308
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,128
She's miserable, Tripp.

1309
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,528
Let it go, guys.

1310
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,415
Ace!

1311
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,775
My bad.

1312
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,012
<i>I once knew a specialist used to send</i>
<i>some of his patients to me.</i>

1313
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,859
<i>All they needed was a little push.</i>

1314
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,894
Look, Paula, this has to stop.

1315
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,255
You don't sleep,

1316
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,814
and the only thing I've seen you eat
in the last three days

1317
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,419
is a bag of Mint Milanos.

1318
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,379
Well, don't worry about me.

1319
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,971
I'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

1320
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,093
What? Where are you going?

1321
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,858
I'm moving back to Colorado.

1322
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,896
What are you gonna do in Colorado?

1323
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,773
- I haven't figured it out.
- Well, that's stupid.

1324
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,050
I mean, what are you gonna do
until you figure it out?

1325
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,408
Move in with your parents?

1326
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,817
Oh. That's so wrong.

1327
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:23,013
Don't judge me, okay?
I mean, you, of all people?

1328
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,608
Pretty funny.

1329
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,095
You know what?
I'm the one who's in a real relationship!

1330
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,017
You're the one who lies for a living!

1331
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,779
You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything!

1332
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,856
Did you really think
you'd never get caught?

1333
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,459
You could've been happy
but you blew it.

1334
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,536
Now you try to act
like it's everyone else's fault,

1335
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:38,615
but it's all you.

1336
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,571
And now you think
Colorado's the answer?

1337
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,930
You know, Kit,
just because you finally convinced a guy

1338
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,698
to sleep with you more than once

1339
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,853
doesn't make you
an expert on relationships.

1340
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,891
- Tripp!
- Tripp!

1341
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,369
Come on up, buddy.

1342
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,252
- Tripp!
- Tripp?

1343
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,648
Hey! Hey, buddy!

1344
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,697
Come up. There you are.

1345
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,809
- Is he...
- Hey.

1346
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,652
Hey, guys.

1347
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,133
You were bitten by a chuckwalla.

1348
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,616
That shouldn't have happened.
It's a reptile of peace.

1349
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,895
I have a theory.

1350
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,488
This isn't the first time
that nature's lashed out at you like this.

1351
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,335
I believe it's because your life

1352
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,815
is fundamentally at odds
with the natural world.

1353
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,290
- Huh?
- Therefore, nature rejects you.

1354
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,173
You're insane.

1355
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:32,769
Can I have some water?

1356
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,174
- Yeah.
- Right here.

1357
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,575
- Here we go.
- Okay, okay, easy.

1358
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,459
Look, I've been all over the world.

1359
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,730
You're the only human to my knowledge
who's been bitten by a dolphin,

1360
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,169
a chipmunk, and a vegetarian lizard
in the same calendar year.

1361
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,297
And you haven't been
a very good friend, either.

1362
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,411
Do you realise that not once
have you asked me

1363
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,973
about my relationship with Kit?

1364
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,611
Dude, did you just drop me
from a 40-foot cliff?

1365
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,931
I mean, you want
to talk about a friend, man,

1366
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,209
you went behind my back,

1367
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,456
and blackmailed your way
into getting your girlfriend.

1368
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,888
He's right.

1369
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,570
- I'm sorry I dropped you from a cliff.
- It's okay.

1370
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,459
Granted, he used you,
but not out of malice.

1371
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,491
Look at him.
How many chances is he gonna get?

1372
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,178
He saw a chance for love, Tripp,
and he took it.

1373
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,211
Which is exactly
what we wanted for you.

1374
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,969
Am I getting advice

1375
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,455
from my two loser buddies
who still live at home?

1376
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,093
Actually, I own my home.

1377
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,213
- What?
- No, you don't.

1378
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,819
I bought it a couple of years ago
from my mom.

1379
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,929
That way, she has a place to live

1380
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,459
and I don't get nailed
on the inheritance tax.

1381
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,649
- Smart.
- Wow.

1382
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,931
And Demo, here, has chosen
the life of a wanderer.

1383
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,170
I mean, sure,
he technically still lives at home.

1384
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,211
- Yeah.
- But his permanent address

1385
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,455
is in his heart.

1386
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,289
He's a bum.

1387
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,014
I think what we're trying to say
is that the two of us are happy

1388
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,739
and we're perfectly functional.

1389
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,575
And you, Tripp, are not.

1390
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,289
Mom?

1391
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,215
Pop?

1392
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,974
Yeah, baby!

1393
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,854
Hey, Pop.

1394
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,458
Hey! Tripp. What are you doing here?

1395
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,777
Just came by to get some stuff.
What are you doing?

1396
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,369
Feeding my fish.

1397
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,775
Yeah. I see that.

1398
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,739
You're naked. In my room.

1399
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,299
Well, this is my Naked Room.

1400
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,619
I mean, it's my house.

1401
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,569
A man ought to be able to do whatever
he wants to do in his own house.

1402
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,892
Wore a suit for 40 years.

1403
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,211
- So now we got 40 years of...
- No suit.

1404
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,489
No suit.

1405
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,894
All right.

1406
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,053
I'm gonna let you get back
to feeding your fish.

1407
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,977
Thanks for stopping by.

1408
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,739
Hey, Pop? Seriously, man,
was it that bad having me around?

1409
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,698
Don't be an idiot, Son.
Your mom and I love you.

1410
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,693
Then why didn't you
just say something?

1411
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,573
All you had to do was tell me.

1412
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,978
You needed time
after Amy had passed away, Tripp.

1413
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,534
And who knows how much time is right?

1414
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,170
Is it two years? Is it six years?

1415
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,372
Then I ran into Bud and Bev Nestor,
and they'd worked with Paula.

1416
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,259
And their son is really happy now.

1417
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,373
Lives in Seattle, I think.
Married an Indian girl.

1418
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,495
Anyway, it just seemed easier.

1419
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,735
Easier.

1420
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:50,855
All right.

1421
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,934
Hey, man,

1422
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,496
I gotta say, I like
what you've done with the place.

1423
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,373
Yeah, I like it. I love you, Son.

1424
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,138
I love you, too. Shake on it.

1425
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,335
Why don't you get back
to scaring those fish, buddy? Huh?

1426
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,449
All right.

1427
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,418
Come back anytime, Son.

1428
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,098
Come here. Bucket. Bucket.

1429
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,137
- Hey, Mom.
- Tripp.

1430
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,013
You see what's going on upstairs?

1431
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,336
Pop's naked, in his Naked Room.

1432
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,212
I know. He's always wanted one.

1433
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,819
He tried to take over the dining room

1434
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,693
until I convinced him
that the first floor was problematic.

1435
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,539
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1436
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,379
Just came by to pick up some clothes.

1437
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,488
I'm sorry.

1438
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,213
It was a lousy thing to do.

1439
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,537
You know, when we first met Paula,

1440
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,499
when we hired her, I...

1441
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,658
I didn't want you to go.

1442
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,054
For years, I've been dreading
the day you'd leave

1443
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,490
and I always thought
it was 'cause I'd miss you so much.

1444
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,573
Then I realised that
that was only part of it.

1445
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,731
I didn't want you to leave because

1446
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,498
being alone with your father
freaks the living shit out of me.

1447
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,771
- What?
- I'm terrified, Tripp!

1448
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,896
And it's not just about the Naked Room.

1449
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,258
Since your father retired, I just...

1450
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,818
I'm used to having you here.

1451
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,776
Like a buffer, you know?
Somebody to talk to

1452
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,255
when your father's all
moody and sullen, and...

1453
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,655
Now I'm...

1454
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,499
We're just gonna have to
get to know each other all over again.

1455
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,569
And...

1456
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,729
What?

1457
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,853
What if he doesn't like me?

1458
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,569
Hey.

1459
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,019
You still love him, right?

1460
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,613
Against all odds.

1461
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,813
Then you'll figure it out.

1462
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,335
Come here.

1463
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,818
Hey.

1464
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,259
You're gonna miss me.

1465
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,456
That's true.

1466
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:26,058
I called you all here together
because obviously we have a situation.

1467
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,855
I know we all feel some responsibility,
but this isn't about blame,

1468
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,096
it's about finding a solution.

1469
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,411
Two people we love are hurting.

1470
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:37,213
So let's put on our thinking caps.

1471
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,218
Man, this shirt feels
like it weighs 100 pounds.

1472
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:41,409
Albert!

1473
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,139
Okay, how about this?

1474
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:49,813
We send flowers to Paula from Tripp,

1475
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:54,252
and flowers to Tripp from Paula.

1476
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,530
- Then what?
- Then they love each other.

1477
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,979
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1478
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,499
Because of the flowers!

1479
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,408
Thank you, Phillip.

1480
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,658
Now, let's all try to come up with a plan
that's not so idiotic.

1481
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,449
Hey.

1482
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,455
Listen,

1483
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,852
I went through all the CDs,
but if you end up with some of mine

1484
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,857
or I end up with some of yours,

1485
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,698
let's just call it even, okay?

1486
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,534
Okay, sure.

1487
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,089
Okay.

1488
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,129
I hate this.

1489
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,488
I know. I do, too.

1490
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,729
So...

1491
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,219
So let's just get it over with, then.

1492
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,977
Okay, look, I know I'm a girl

1493
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,011
and I'm supposed to be better
at this emotional crap

1494
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,096
but I'm not, so I'm just gonna say it.

1495
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,293
I'm sorry that I pointed out to you
that you fell in love with a client

1496
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,729
and that made you go crazy
and turn into a total bitch.

1497
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,089
Wow.

1498
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,499
That must've been really hard
for you to say.

1499
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:10,408
I thought it was going to be, but I just
kind of breezed right through it.

1500
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:13,933
Well, thanks.

1501
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,250
And I'm sorry that I pointed out

1502
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,530
that you haven't had a real relationship
for the last five years

1503
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,412
because I'm the only person
who can tolerate

1504
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,337
your bizarre and violent mood swings.

1505
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,458
Oh, thank you!

1506
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:31,855
Goodbye.

1507
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,129
I'm gonna miss you.

1508
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,534
Yeah, I'm going to miss you, too.

1509
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,210
Can I at least give you
a ride to the airport?

1510
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,295
Sure.

1511
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,138
On the way, let's stop at Phillip's,

1512
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,979
so I can give you back
that sweater of yours that you lost.

1513
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,975
Wow! This is fantastic!

1514
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,818
- Yeah, it's pretty great.
- Wow.

1515
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:58,010
At this point, we're just waiting
for his mom to kick it

1516
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,653
so we can move upstairs.

1517
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,373
That is a lovely sentiment.

1518
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,535
Go, go, go, go!

1519
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,329
Hey!

1520
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,531
Kit! What are you...

1521
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,014
Oh, hi, fellas.

1522
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,375
- Look in the closet.
- Hey, just look

1523
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,489
- Yeah.
...right in the closet.

1524
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,575
Why?

1525
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,815
- Huh?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1526
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,010
Wait! What are you guys doing?

1527
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,533
Sorry. I tried to do it fast
so it wouldn't hurt.

1528
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,457
You were concerned about hurting me?

1529
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,739
That's a refreshing change of pace.

1530
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,334
Listen, I say there's no downside.
They already hate each other.

1531
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,415
I wonder how they're doing.

1532
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,734
Whoa, whoa, hold on just a second.

1533
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,578
Let's check, shall we?

1534
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,098
Okay, watch this.

1535
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,493
Is this how it's gonna be?
'Cause your note says,

1536
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,576
"Hi, we need to talk."

1537
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,099
Yeah, I wrote that.

1538
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,134
Right after I tied myself to the chair
and covered my mouth with duct tape.

1539
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,410
- So you don't want to talk.
- To you?

1540
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,248
I'll pass.

1541
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,536
I can't see her face.
Do you have any other angles?

1542
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,173
Of course I have angles. Check it out.

1543
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,218
I installed 27 cameras that cover
every inch of the apartment.

1544
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,691
- Were these up last night?
- Yeah.

1545
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,175
No.

1546
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,739
I helped tie the knots.

1547
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,578
The one on his feet
is called an Anchor Hitch.

1548
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,099
I could get out of those ropes.

1549
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,573
You can't get out
of your barbecue apron.

1550
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,808
This is ridiculous,
not to mention juvenile.

1551
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,659
We can't just sit here
and not say anything.

1552
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,971
All right, fine. I'll start.

1553
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,131
I think you're being a jackass.

1554
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:03,128
I think those pants make you look fat,
but in a sexy...

1555
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,656
- I don't get it.
- I told you this was a stupid idea.

1556
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,215
Hey.

1557
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,454
We should have done the flowers.

1558
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,458
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to say something.

1559
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,819
Tripp, I apologise.

1560
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,890
My job was manipulative and deceitful.

1561
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,808
But the second that I found out
about Amy, I was gonna end it.

1562
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,658
But I never got the chance,
because you found out first.

1563
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,020
Sorry. Sorry.

1564
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,931
Sorry. Sorry.

1565
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,499
Apology accepted.

1566
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,935
Thank you.

1567
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,373
Come on.
You don't want to say anything?

1568
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,968
- You know, I do have a question.
- Absolutely. Anything.

1569
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,249
How many others were there?
Before me.

1570
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:02,219
I'm just asking, 'cause, you know,
maybe we could all get together.

1571
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,773
You know, form a support group.

1572
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,095
And if there already is a group,
I'm curious,

1573
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,211
is it a small group,
like a basketball team?

1574
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,853
Or is it a big group,

1575
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,969
like the Chinese?

1576
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,099
Wow. Somebody's a little cranky today.

1577
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,849
Tripp, your mother was still making you
pancakes for breakfast.

1578
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,540
And it's not as if
I waltzed into your life unbidden.

1579
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,412
Your parents called me.

1580
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,533
Your life was in
an extended stall pattern.

1581
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,139
I wish I could talk to guys like that.

1582
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,171
Well, it's easier when the guy is tied up.

1583
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,372
No, I've talked to guys tied up before.

1584
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,816
You want to talk about my life?
What about your life?

1585
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,214
Hey, but maybe I shouldn't judge.

1586
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,059
I'm sure there's some reason
that you turned out to be a soul-sucking,

1587
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:43,296
Labrador-retriever-killing harpy.

1588
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,376
I don't get it.
How does the dog fit into it?

1589
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,819
- Good question.
- Can you turn it up?

1590
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,013
Well, they're laptop speakers, so...

1591
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,534
Unless...

1592
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,898
I was doing fine before you showed up.

1593
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,654
All right? I was having fun.

1594
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,293
Oh, and I just ruined everything!

1595
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,771
So is that why you tried
to break up with me?

1596
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,460
Or actually, you didn't.
You just trotted out your parents

1597
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,775
so that I would have
to break up with you.

1598
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,368
- Oh, snap!
- That got his attention!

1599
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,697
That's right, you call her on her shit,
she's gonna call you on yours!

1600
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,459
What are you going to do, baby?
Are you gonna cry?

1601
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,695
Sorry.

1602
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,451
Why would you do that?

1603
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,329
Because

1604
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,933
you gave me "the look."

1605
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,971
- Not "the look."
- Why are you bringing up "the look"?

1606
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,089
What's "the look"?

1607
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,697
The look that says, "Hey, I like you."

1608
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,454
Oh, wow.

1609
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,456
That must've been horrible for you.

1610
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:41,775
Do I do "the look"?

1611
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,889
Well, yeah.

1612
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,055
Well, no.

1613
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:46,212
I never meant to hurt you.

1614
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,971
I believe that.
But what do I know about you?

1615
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:57,452
I mean, the entire amount of time
we spent together was just a big scam.

1616
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:03,176
I found a woman I cared about,
and she turned out to be a total fraud.

1617
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,178
Do you have real feelings?

1618
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,896
Of course I have real feelings.

1619
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,329
- For what?
- For you!

1620
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,056
And believe me, I did not want that,

1621
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,740
because I had a good life before you.

1622
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,298
Well, not good, but it was okay.

1623
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,735
Well, it was empty, actually,

1624
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,535
but at least I was blissfully unaware
of how miserable I was!

1625
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,333
Whereas now, because of you,

1626
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,856
I am acutely aware

1627
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,097
of how completely
and totally unhappy I am!

1628
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,608
Thank you for that.

1629
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:54,096
I don't usually like reality TV shows,
but this is so emotional.

1630
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,258
Are you crying?

1631
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,375
Come on, Tripp.

1632
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,649
He's moving.

1633
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,293
He's rolling. Here we go.

1634
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,853
He's making a move! All right!

1635
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,652
He's moving his feet! He's rolling!

1636
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,213
- Go! Go!
- Go!

1637
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,853
Oh, my God! He could

1638
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,459
- go all the way!
- Go all the way!

1639
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,890
Don't do all the work, Son!
Make her meet you halfway!

1640
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,133
So what do we do now?

1641
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,575
Actually, it's quite simple.

1642
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,089
You just have to decide.

1643
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:54,294
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life having fun?

1644
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,331
Or do you want to spend it with me?

1645
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,378
Shut up.
Not everything you say is perfect.

1646
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,139
We can have a little bit of fun, can't we?

1647
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,969
Way to go, man!

1648
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:14,695
All right!

1649
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,609
Yeah!

1650
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,809
Hallelujah!

1651
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,098
Show's over. You don't need to see that.

1652
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,211
Come on, let's you and I
go outside, huh?

1653
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,296
Play some football.
I'll show you how to throw it deep.

1654
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,650
After, I'll show you
how to ice your shoulder down.

1655
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,334
Give you a hand?

1656
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,213
You just take it easy.
I got everything under control.

1657
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,610
Hey, what's the champagne about?

1658
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:55,934
It's Thursday.

1659
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,095
Thank you.

1660
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,849
You're welcome.

1661
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,335
Cheers.

1662
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,173
All right, Captain,
where are we heading?

1663
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,372
There's a lighthouse!
Can we go over there?

1664
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,691
Sure. You're driving.

1665
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,415
Tripp! Jibe ho! God, I said it late!

1666
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,609
I'm sorry!

1667
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,577
- Tripp!
- What happened to "jibe ho"?

1668
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,418
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

1669
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:44,213
Yeah. Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

1670
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,171
Maybe a collapsed lung,
a bruised sternum.

1671
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,052
Other than that, I'll survive.

1672
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,740
I'm going to get you
a flotation device, okay?

1673
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,895
Yeah.

1674
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,134
Stay right there.

1675
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,092
That's a good idea.

1676
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,455
Oh, shit.

1677
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,334
Oh, shit!

1678
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:06,050
No biting! No biting. No bite, no bite.
No, no, no, no...

1679
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,689
Come here, boy.

1680
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,089
Come here, boy.

1681
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,491
Yeah. Yeah.

1682
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,579
That's it. Okay.

1683
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,258
Here! I...

1684
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,658
Oh, my God!

1685
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,769
Yeah.

1686
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,899
That's amazing.

1687
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,175
What do you say, big man, huh?

1688
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,451
Hey, still need this?

1689
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,773
No, I'm good.

1690
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,815
I'm real good.

1691
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,655
Okay.

1692
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,691
Honey, it's an Eastern Wood-Pewee.

1693
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,775
Eastern Wood-Pewee?

1694
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,891
You couldn't be more wrong
if you called it a Canadian goose.

1695
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,458
I'll give you a Canadian goose.

1696
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,849
Look!

1697
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,253
He's so tame.

1698
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:50,133
Yeah. See, once we accept the fact
that we're not separate from nature,

1699
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,818
she welcomes us. And it's not with fear.

1700
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,532
Right? Who do you love?

1701
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,653
<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1702
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,133
- <i>And don't you come back</i>
- <i>And don't you come back</i>

1703
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,252
- <i>... no more, no more, no more, no more</i>
- <i>... no more, no more, no more, no more</i>

1704
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,859
- <i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>
- <i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1705
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:09,017
- <i>And don't you come back no more</i>
- <i>And don't you come back no more</i>

1706
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,255
<i>What'd I say?</i>
