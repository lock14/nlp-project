0
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:18,847
Yo, we should just play this
straight up.

1
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:21,405
Those cats will fold under pressure.

2
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,406
We can take these fools
with our eyes closed. Come on.

3
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:27,454
No doubt, but I don't wanna diss them
in front of their home crowd.

4
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:30,414
D, I got you.

5
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,290
I got y'all.

6
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,889
- All right, man.
- Come on, let's do it.

7
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:06,090
All right, all right, y'all, that was hot!

8
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,735
And the winner is...

9
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,491
Sphere and the Thug Unit!

10
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,886
Who wants next?

11
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,093
Let's get it going on in here.

12
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:19,894
- Y'all want some of this?
- We got next.

13
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,684
Let's go.

14
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,928
All right, all right, y'all, let's get
it popping in this mall!

15
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:42,168
You haven't seen him pop.
Come on, come on.

16
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:06,889
- Hey, got that?
- Get out of here!

17
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:09,890
- Get back.
- Break it up.

18
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:13,048
- Get back. Get back.
- We good.

19
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,094
All right, all right, let's hear it
for the Thug Unit.

20
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:19,250
Yeah!

21
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,693
Give it up for the Goon Squad!

22
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:28,088
What's up?
I think the Goon Squad got it, y'all.

23
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,376
No, no, no.
Double or nothing says you got lucky.

24
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,287
No, no, no.
Double or nothing says you got lucky.

25
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,209
It's on.

26
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:40,449
- Let's go! Let's go!
- What the hell are you doing?

27
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,208
Man, I'm out.

28
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,089
What the hell you walking away for?

29
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,814
I say we double up on these niggas.

30
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:49,729
- You know this ain't our spot, D.
- Sphere's crew don't know us.

31
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:51,488
Don't know
what we're bringing, period.

32
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,886
- The more paper we take home.
- Did you see that cat?

33
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:56,616
If he thinks he's being hustled,
that's paper we won't spend.

34
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,687
- Why are you acting all scared?
- I'm not.

35
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:01,416
- I'm acting smart. You try it!
- Don't I always got your back?

36
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,089
Don't I always have your back?

37
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:06,692
- You know I got it, man, but I'm...
- lf you ain't with it, just go home.

38
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,086
- Like you could do this without me.
- For real, DJ.

39
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,289
We ain't shit without your brother.

40
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:15,244
You know, it's gonna get
nasty up in here!

41
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,850
- Don't wanna let stuff get out of hand...
- Don't sweat it.

42
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,371
We came too far to turn back now,
baby boy. I want this.

43
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,209
You want this? I knew you'd say
something like you want this.

44
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:26,254
That's all this is about. Typical DJ.

45
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:29,289
It's not just about you,
it's about all of us. We're a team.

46
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:34,333
Well, this team's about to double up
on their asses. Come on.

47
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:37,135
All right now, y'all ready to rip this?

48
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,534
Let's get it going on up in this mall!

49
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:41,845
Let's go!

50
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:52,013
It's over! It's over!
All right, all right, y'all!

51
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:56,533
This one, hands down,
the Goon Squad!

52
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,727
You're dead! You're dead!

53
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,528
Goon Squad! Goon Squad is up.

54
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:15,052
I'm telling you, man,
we're taking over L.A.

55
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,729
- Believe that.
- Yeah.

56
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,170
Hold up, guys.

57
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,254
- Hey, man, what's your brother doing?
- Man, I don't know.

58
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,326
- I got a little something for y'all.
- All right. All right.

59
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,532
That's what's up.
You know what I'm saying?

60
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,687
Yeah, man.

61
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,372
We gotta take Von home.
His mom's gonna trip.

62
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,565
I have your mama.

63
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:42,806
- He'll get a beating.
- Miss Williams ain't banging on me.

64
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:46,491
- Why you gotta do my mom like that?
- I was doing her like that. Last night.

65
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,608
Give me my money!

66
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:05,610
I got it! I got it!

67
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,774
- I want my money.
- The money's mine.

68
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:12,929
I want it.

69
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,609
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

70
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,053
Get out of here.

71
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,215
D!

72
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,051
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!
- Let's go. Move it!

73
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:36,214
Get up, D!

74
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,287
Come on!

75
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:45,085
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

76
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,486
Somebody do something!

77
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:55,014
<i>We'd lik</i> e <i>to welcom</i>e
<i>all arriving passengers to Atlanta</i>.

78
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:18,848
We are so glad
to have you here, DJ.

79
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,290
You're in Atlanta, we'll get you
a Hawks jersey or something.

80
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:24,809
Honey, nobody watches the Hawks.

81
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,854
That's your uncle's way
of saying welcome to Georgia.

82
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,126
You'll get used to the humidity.

83
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:48,686
You must be so excited
to start school.

84
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,130
Or nervous.

85
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,412
But don't be. You'll do just fine.

86
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:55,605
You know that's where
I met your uncle.

87
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:58,730
You guys went to Truth?

88
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,729
I did. Your uncle was working there.

89
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:05,248
Come on, let me show you
up to your room. This way.

90
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,205
That's your bathroom over there,
and this is your room.

91
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:19,096
If you get tired of campus food,
you're more than welcome...

92
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,975
...to spend your weekends
here with us, anytime.

93
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,854
You know,
whatever makes you comfortable.

94
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,529
Thanks.

95
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:33,932
DJ, I didn't get a chance to tell you
at the funeral...

96
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:36,807
...but you know we loved him.

97
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,808
I know how close you two were.

98
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,648
I gotta run and show a house...

99
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:46,250
...so when I get back,
I'll make us all some dinner.

100
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,445
Okay?

101
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:57,811
Honey, go ahead
and help yourself to some apple pie.

102
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,694
I know it's your favourite.

103
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,209
No, no, thanks.

104
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,135
You know I had to call in a favour
to get you into this school.

105
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:07,570
- Don't make me look bad.
- Nate.

106
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,647
- No, that's cool. I'm listening.
- Good.

107
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,966
Because the rules are very simple.

108
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,048
There's three things
you have to deal with.

109
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:18,449
First, you must keep your grades up
at all times.

110
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:21,130
Second, I'm in charge
of your work study programme...

111
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,127
...but you'll not be
treated differently...

112
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,015
...nor will you behave any different
than my other 26 employees.

113
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,644
- And third?
- Lf there's a strike three, you out.

114
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,535
Period.

115
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,654
DJ?

116
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,614
What the hell is going on, man?

117
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:07,491
I'm not gonna sit out here and act
like I wanna be here when I don't.

118
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,409
This whole college boy thing
is not for me, man.

119
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,492
You're the only thing
your mama's got left.

120
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:19,207
There's no way I'm gonna let you
put my sister through any more pain.

121
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:23,410
So you better make this college thing
work out. Can you appreciate that?

122
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,886
Get your black ungrateful ass
in the goddamn truck.

123
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:36,006
What'd I say, man? Get in the truck!

124
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,005
At least you don't have a problem
with waking up early.

125
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:55,254
Looks like you're just in time
for registration.

126
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:48,248
Next.

127
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,968
Yo, yo, hold my spot real quick.

128
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,454
- This is my spot, thanks.
- Excuse me?

129
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:29,891
- There was a girl saving my space.
- Nice try.

130
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,967
You have to wait in line
like everybody else.

131
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,092
You saw me
behind the sister with the fro.

132
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:35,735
Next.

133
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,528
Now, one of you come up
to the counter.

134
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:11,366
<i>I'm just saying it's a littl</i>e e<i>arly</i>
<i>to tell, Mom. That's all</i>.

135
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,051
<i>No, I'm not saying I hate it</i>.

136
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,971
I'm not quitting. I promised you I'd try.
That's my word.

137
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:22,848
I love you too.

138
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,325
Okay. Bye.

139
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,895
All right.

140
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:45,727
There are only a select few things
of mine that are absolutely off-limits.

141
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:50,094
My toothbrush, my toothpaste,
my shaving cream, and my condoms.

142
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,886
Magnums, of course.
You know about the gold packs?

143
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:55,286
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:59,010
Other than that, playboy,
anything else of mine...

145
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:00,768
...you're welcome to. Rich Brown.

146
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,805
- DJ.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

147
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:08,009
The Deltas
are having a little barbecue.

148
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:11,290
- I've got some juice, I can get you in.
- I gotta work.

149
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,330
- Classes ain't started yet.
- I got a job.

150
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,848
Okay, I feel you. Which...?

151
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:20,849
Never mind.

152
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:24,009
All right, bro. In that case, I'll holler.

153
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,405
Yes.

154
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:39,974
Come in.

155
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,367
Don't just stand there, man.
Sit down.

156
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,008
Is this your office?

157
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:58,214
Awfully nice digs for somebody
who cuts grass.

158
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,934
No, I don't cut grass.

159
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,685
But you do.

160
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,252
<i>You ever wonder</i>
<i>where them trains be going?</i>

161
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:22,887
They probably be going to Japan
or something.

162
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,808
- Japan?
- Oh, yeah, they can't cross water.

163
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,331
You going to college?
Don't say that when you get there.

164
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,815
I'm just playing with you, man.

165
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:33,413
The key to success in going to school,
what you do, you get a group of girls...

166
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,089
...you get them
to do your homework.

167
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:38,329
<i>When they do your homework,</i>
<i>you get A 's</i>.

168
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:51,329
- How's it going, man?
- I'm still standing.

169
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,612
Get in, man.
I'll give you a ride back.

170
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:08,886
Come on, come on.
Pass the ball. Pass the ball.

171
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:12,014
Yeah, baby. Go deep. Go long.

172
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,645
They're getting the
very same education as you...

173
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:20,286
...so don't pay them any mind.

174
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:31,811
Oh, check it out.

175
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:34,649
Oh, that's old news, brother.
I've been there and done that.

176
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,369
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

177
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,690
Rich...

178
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,414
DJ, right?

179
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,806
My new roommate, DJ.
DJ, that's my friend Noel.

180
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,131
Good to meet you, brother.

181
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,289
Now, Thetas.

182
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,129
Everybody got quiet like
y'all can't get down!

183
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:56,968
<i>What?</i>

184
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,611
Are we the Pythons?

185
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,848
- What the hell are they doing, man?
- They're stomping the yard.

186
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,927
<i>Yes</i>.

187
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,655
Where are you from?

188
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,613
- The Thetas are representing.
- All day.

189
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,215
Smooth it out now.

190
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,652
<i>Funky and you know it,</i>
<i>clap your hands</i>.

191
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:22,254
<i>Smooth!</i>

192
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,328
<i>Smooth!</i>

193
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,726
<i>Smooth!</i>

194
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,652
- Yo, I meant to...
<i>- Smooth!</i>

195
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,254
<i>- Theta Nu!</i>
<i>- Theta what?</i>

196
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,690
<i>- Theta Nu!</i>
<i>- Theta what?</i>

197
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,130
<i>- Theta Nu!</i>
<i>- Theta what?</i>

198
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:38,854
<i>Theta Nu!</i>

199
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:40,290
<i>Theta Nu!</i>

200
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,971
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

201
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:57,650
Yo, get your hands off me, dog.

202
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,251
Fool, you're about
to get your ass whooped.

203
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,447
Throw his ass to the wolves!

204
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,532
Can I get up here, man?
Because I can't see.

205
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:12,051
- Yeah?
- Hey, isn't that your boy, DJ?

206
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,729
Hold it, G.

207
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,090
Listen, man.

208
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:16,974
I don't know
if you're crazy or stupid...

209
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,366
...but you gotta keep it moving.
- Hey, Zeke!

210
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,213
When you're done playing
with your bitch...

211
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,936
...we're gonna show you
what a real ass-whooping look like.

212
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:29,889
Line up, Mus!

213
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,614
Mus, march!

214
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,455
Mus, hut!

215
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:52,131
Back it up! Back it up! Back it up!

216
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,769
<i>Mu!</i>

00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,134
<i>- T-H-E-T-A!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

222
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:28,015
<i>- T-H-E-T-A!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

223
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,894
<i>Who's that creeping in my window?</i>

224
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:32,331
<i>Now! Theta Nu!</i>

225
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,174
<i>Who's that creeping in my window?</i>

226
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,611
<i>Now! Theta Nu!</i>

227
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,767
<i>Who's that creeping in my window?</i>

228
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,895
<i>Now! Theta Nu!</i>

229
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,088
<i>What?</i>

00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:50,085
<i>T-N-T!</i>

00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:55,331
<i>Explosive, explosive, explosiv</i>e.

00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,615
<i>Wolf pack, march!</i>

00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:13,649
<i>- M-U!</i>

<i>Gamma Mu Xi!</i>

<i>Gamma Mu Xi!</i>

00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:21,089
<i>Gamma Mu Xi!</i>

237
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,495
<i>Wolf pack attack!</i>

238
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:51,689
<i>Mu!</i>

<i>The seven- year champs are her</i>e.

00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:09,684
<i>The seven- year champs are her</i>e.

242
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:20,856
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:22,649
How are you doing?

244
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,811
Aren't you that guy that was fighting
with that girl in the line?

245
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,127
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.

246
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:31,969
April!

247
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,055
- Hey, babe.
- What's up, baby girl?

248
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:37,487
- I thought I told you to wait for me.
- I know, I had to go to the library.

249
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:40,327
- Who's your friend?
- DJ.

250
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,405
DJ was just passing by.

251
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,888
Oh, yeah. I remember you.

252
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:48,206
You're the idiot
that tried to break our step line.

253
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:51,050
Yeah, well, it seems like DJ
has a thing with lines.

254
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,527
You see those flags there?

255
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:58,654
You don't mess with the Mus
and you don't mess with my girl.

256
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,374
I'm gonna bounce.

257
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,014
You don't know
what you're talking about.

258
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,446
Here, it's all about the haves
and the have-mores.

259
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:35,847
Either you come in first place
or you're not even in the game, player.

260
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:38,689
Oh, yo, guys, this is DJ.

261
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,416
You know Noel, this is Byron, Paul.

262
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,289
- That's Easy over there.
- What's up?

263
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:45,931
Yo, get that camera out of my face,
man.

264
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,249
I was saying Theta Nu Theta is
gonna wipe the floor with Mu Gamma.

265
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,132
- How's that?
- Because I'm gonna join.

266
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,368
Dude, why are you pledging
Theta anyway? They tired.

267
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:57,925
- They pull no women.
- They never win step championships.

268
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:00,132
- So?
- "So?"

269
00:28:00,656 --> 00:28:02,453
- What else is there?
- What about history?

270
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,295
What about tradition?
Give me my damn hat.

271
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,128
- What about legacy?
- A legacy of losing.

272
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,931
He's just saying that
because his father was a Theta.

273
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:11,973
Anyway, DJ,
please ignore their ignorance.

274
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:14,650
You need to roll with us
to the Rep Yo' City Blast tonight.

275
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:16,488
- Roll with us.
- To the what?

276
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:23,012
Where my St. Louis folks at?
S-T-L, show some love.

277
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:27,089
You know how we do it every week at
the Phoenix! Give me love, Miami.

278
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:30,409
C-H-I,
my Chicago folks in the building.

279
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:32,846
Show some love.
Give it up for the A hometown people.

280
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,369
Where you at? Show your A.

281
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,572
I see you, Jamaica.
Do your thing, mon.

282
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,131
Watch out for the lovely ladies
in blue and white. I see you.

283
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:44,445
- What's up, sir?
- What's up?

284
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:46,208
You good, man?

285
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,765
Oh, damn, Rich.
You hanging with the freshmen now?

286
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,415
- What?
- Oh, no. This is my roommate.

287
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,134
This is DJ. DJ, this is Grant.

288
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:55,971
That's nice. But see,
this section is for upperclassmen.

289
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,965
You know what we call freshmen?

290
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:02,248
We call them bootlickers,
because that's all they good for.

291
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,534
You know
what we call guys like you?

292
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,414
- No, what?
- Pretenders.

293
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,050
- You're gonna wish I was pretending...
- You don't know me.

294
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,535
Okay, okay! Okay, okay!

295
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:15,085
And on that note,
we gonna go to the bar.

296
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:17,249
Y'all have a good night.

297
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:19,687
Why you so sensitive, dog?

298
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:22,416
It's a little freshman hazing.
We all have to go through it.

299
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,328
Straight up,
that dude is whack, man.

300
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,772
Well, maybe.
But he's Zeke's prodigy.

301
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,450
- Who the hell is Zeke?
- He's the head of Mu Gamma.

302
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:32,368
Seven-time national step champs.

303
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:35,334
And your boy, Grant, he's next in line
to take the throne.

304
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:37,248
- Just chill.
- You're killing me with that.

305
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,976
Every week, you know
how we do it in the Phoenix.

306
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,455
Go to the dance floor.

307
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,414
Rep your city, wherever you're from.
It's about that time.

308
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,249
We got N-Y-C, obviously.

309
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,011
I hope he had a condom on.

310
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,415
What's he doing?

311
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,051
- Didn't think you were coming.
- What are you doing?

312
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:10,968
Come on.
Don't play at being jealous.

313
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,410
I'm not playing at anything.

314
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:13,725
It was just a show.

315
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:15,609
Well, I didn't like it.

316
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:19,212
It's not like I was doing it for real.
I was just adding a little flavour.

317
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:22,049
Keep yourself looking this fine,
you ain't never gotta worry.

318
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:24,170
Excuse me?

319
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:26,486
Hey, Grant, where are you at?
Your city needs you.

320
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,931
Sit down with your girls,
have another drink on me...

321
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:30,654
...and watch your man do his thing.

322
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:39,531
He's just being a man.

323
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:43,093
There isn't a single woman in here
that wouldn't kill to be with him.

324
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,129
- Don't make it easy on them.
- You know you don't deserve that.

325
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:51,215
It's not that big of a deal.

326
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,571
Didn't I tell you to keep
your distance from my girl?

327
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:56,449
See, now, I thought you was just
pretending again.

328
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:59,369
New York City, where you at?
Rep your city, it's your turn!

329
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,492
Grant, they need you on the floor.

330
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:04,170
When I'm done,
you better be gone...

331
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,007
...bootlicker.

332
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:14,690
- I can take care of myself.
- I know you can.

333
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:17,324
No, really. Grant is not someone
you want to mess with.

334
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:19,566
Somebody's gonna have to
bring him down a notch.

335
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,528
What the hell is this nigga doing?

336
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:32,768
What's this? It looks like we got
a new addition added to the mix.

337
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:35,370
Hey, yo, kid.
What city you representing?

338
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,254
I ain't repping nothing. Just me.

339
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,453
Oh, don't clown him. Don't clown him.

340
00:32:07,616 --> 00:32:10,369
You'll hurt him, Grant. Don't hurt him.

341
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:12,248
Y'all know
how Grant does it, y'all.

342
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:16,091
Give it up for G, Grant.
New York in the house!

343
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:38,569
Oh, snap!
Is he clowning St. Louis?

344
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:43,208
Is he breaking on Jamaica?

345
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,370
Wait a minute.
Oh, he's clowning everybody!

346
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:48,935
He's clowning on the Chi guy!

347
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:55,888
Oh, this is crazy.
A-T-L, are you gonna take that?

348
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:02,051
Miami! Even Miami!

349
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:13,654
Wait a minute.
Is he coming at Grant?

350
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:23,175
Wait, he's killing him!

351
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,486
That's my roommate.
That's my roommate.

352
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:30,294
Give it up, D!

353
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:32,766
Oh, no, he didn't. Yes, he did.

354
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,165
Yo, goodness.

355
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:52,095
So I guess you thought
you were defending my honour, huh?

356
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:55,693
- April, what are you doing?
- I'm just talking.

357
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,489
You don't have to let this dude
talk to you like that.

358
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:01,733
- Let's just drop it.
- No. What did you say?

359
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:04,171
Somebody'll have to teach you
how to talk to a woman.

360
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,770
- You gonna show me?
- I already schooled you once tonight.

361
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:09,734
- How much do you wanna learn?
- What, you think you funny, nigga?

362
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:12,046
Nah... but she clearly does.

363
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:14,732
- What? No, no, no, Grant.
- It's all good, baby.

364
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,090
- Let's go.
- Come on.

365
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:17,405
Hey, stop.

366
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:20,534
Grant, stop it, stop. Stop.

367
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:21,885
- Let's go.
- Stay out of this.

368
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:23,409
All right, just chill. Grant.

369
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,931
I ain't got nothing against you,
but I told you already.

370
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,564
- This is my roommate, man.
- You do what you gotta do.

371
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,692
Noel, I thought
you was gonna pledge Mu Gamma.

372
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:33,290
- I was gonna...
- I guess you can kiss that goodbye.

373
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:34,605
I'm gonna bounce.

374
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,812
We got unfinished
business, bootlicker.

375
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:39,930
- Indeed.
- Come on, let's go.

376
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:43,372
I got myself here.
I can get myself home.

377
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,606
Maya, will you take me home?

378
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:02,532
Chill out, man.
This is a friendly visit.

379
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,610
I'm Zeke,
president of Mu Gamma Xi.

380
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,368
You know Grant.

381
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,692
We saw you at the Phoenix
and we were impressed.

382
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,135
Ain't that right, Grant?

383
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:14,085
Yeah.

384
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:16,725
I got work to do, man.

385
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,854
Wolves!

386
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,013
Y'all heard the man. Get busy.

387
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:32,609
Now that you got time
on your hands, let's talk.

388
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:36,687
Look, I brought Grant with me
to show you...

389
00:35:36,856 --> 00:35:38,892
...that we don't have
any hard feelings.

390
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:43,126
You're a straight-up guy. I like that.
Working your way through college.

391
00:35:43,336 --> 00:35:45,486
That's admirable,
but this whole gardening thing...

392
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,090
...can't be getting you any play
with the ladies, man.

393
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:49,769
Never had any problems
in that area.

394
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:52,530
Okay,
now I'll get straight to the point.

395
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:57,326
Mu Gamma Xi has the strongest
alumni network, period.

396
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,293
One phone call from us
when you graduate...

397
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,572
...you've got a high-paying job
just like that.

398
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:03,533
So you want me to join your frat?

399
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:05,812
If you step on our line.

400
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,727
Step on the line. I don't step, man.

401
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:11,565
I battle.

402
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:15,210
- What's the difference?
- Pussies step.

403
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:20,614
You should think about what you say
before you say it.

404
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,365
Wolves!

405
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,614
That's enough.

406
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:28,888
Let's let Mr. DJ get back to his...

407
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:32,927
His gardening.

408
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:39,495
- You were right.
- I told you.

409
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:44,451
I'm telling you, Sly.

410
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,775
You didn't see
this dude punk Grant.

411
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:51,485
Look, I'm sure he's a cool dude,
I just don't think he's Theta material.

412
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:52,850
You mean he's too ghetto.

413
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:54,335
I don't care where he's from.

414
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,407
I don't think he got here
based on his SAT's.

415
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:59,249
Okay, fine, so he's not the archetype
of a Theta, but what he...

416
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:02,169
We got other pledges to consider
who have more impressive résumés.

417
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,325
Thank you.

418
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,452
But are they gonna help us
win Nationals?

419
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:07,971
Okay, okay,
so that's what this is about?

420
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:11,526
What are you thinking? Aren't you sick
of living in Mu Gamma's shadow?

421
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:22,370
I'm sorry. Mind if I join you?

422
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,929
Suit yourself.

423
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:32,131
I'm here to talk to you
about Theta Nu Theta.

424
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,214
You're kidding, right?

425
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:36,855
No.

426
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:40,456
- What about it?
- Members of my pledge committee...

427
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:43,574
...feel you'd be an asset to the house.
- No.

428
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,886
Mu Gamma's murdered your asses
for seven years.

429
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,853
You're here
because you think I can help.

430
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,530
You know, you're cocky for a brother
that's got one trick.

431
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:51,970
Please spare me, man.

432
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,735
Spare you, fine.

433
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:57,615
There's a screening process.
All applicants go through it.

434
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,891
You want to apply?

435
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,805
That's up to you.

436
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,967
Mu Gamma comes here
offering me a sweet deal.

437
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:06,287
And the best you can come up
with is I can apply?

438
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:10,893
If a sweet deal is really what
you're looking for, Theta ain't for you.

439
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:15,971
A fraternity, now, that's a brotherhood
of men who forge a lifetime bond.

440
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:20,766
Okay, once you are a Theta, you will
always and forever be a Theta.

441
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:23,848
Now, you can go out of here,
you can leave Truth...

442
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:26,655
...as a young educated brother
from the 'hood.

443
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,044
And homey, that's great.

444
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:33,568
But if you pledge Theta, you're gonna
get that same education...

445
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:37,285
...and you'll become a member
of our lifetime brotherhood.

446
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,970
- Yo, what's up?
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

447
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:03,013
You almost just ran me over
with that thing.

448
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:05,770
- I didn't mean to scare you. My bad.
- What?

449
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,732
It's the dance thug from the club.

450
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:13,772
So can we move on from that?

451
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,449
Move on to what?

452
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:17,208
I don't know.

453
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,850
You getting to know me?

454
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,414
I have a boyfriend.

455
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:25,615
So, what's up with this Grant?
What is he, a professional student?

456
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:27,687
Grant is in a six-year law programme...

457
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:31,246
...and his father's a partner with a Wall
Street firm, so when he graduates...

458
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:34,852
It's funny, because I didn't take you as
the type of girl that could be bought.

459
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:36,290
Bought?

460
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:37,925
Bought.

461
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:41,406
Wait, I didn't mean bought like that.
I didn't mean bought like that. Listen.

462
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:43,168
- What?
- Let's just start over.

463
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:45,645
- Start what over?
- Have lunch with me.

464
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,329
I'm tutoring.

465
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,855
Tutor what? What do you tutor?

466
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,690
Yo.

467
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,245
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'd like to sign up for a tutor.

468
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,054
Okay. What subject?

469
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,128
What subject
does April Palmer tutor?

470
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,891
- History.
- History it is.

471
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:43,647
How'd you pull this off?

472
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,135
What?

473
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:46,935
What, you think I set this up?

474
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:49,371
Well, it's an awful big coincidence,
don't you think?

475
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,893
What you take me for?
Some kind of stalker?

476
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:55,286
Like I'm gonna work that hard
to get your attention.

477
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:59,165
I mean you're fine, but you ain't
all that, you know what I'm saying?

478
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:00,735
Did I set this up?

479
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:03,967
Can I use your pen?

480
00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:05,933
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks.

481
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:08,810
So where do we start?

482
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:12,135
You can start by moving over there.

483
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,368
- Really?
- No, I'm serious.

484
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:21,528
It works better if we can sit
across from each other.

485
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:24,814
All right.

486
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:35,048
This is gonna be good
reading material for you.

487
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:38,127
Time to go.

488
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,294
- Thank God. I'm starving.
- So let's go eat.

489
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,250
I can't.

490
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:45,254
Why?

491
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,213
You know why.

492
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,174
Why are you staring at me?

493
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:58,335
Okay.

494
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,455
I'll make you a deal.

495
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:03,574
Ask me any question
from the history lesson, I get it right...

496
00:42:03,736 --> 00:42:05,135
...we go eat.

497
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,290
Okay.

498
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:14,007
What was the difference
between Republicans'...

499
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,973
...and the Democrats'
political response...

500
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,696
...to the Great Depression
in the 1930s?

501
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:28,251
Some other time maybe.

502
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:31,613
But by political response, were you
referring to the Republicans' belief...

503
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,687
...that the marketplace
will correct itself...

504
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:35,574
...as opposed to
the Democrats' New Deal?

505
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,931
Because the way
you phrased it was...

506
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,255
I'll get my uncle's truck.

507
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:43,568
I'll drive.

508
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,295
So I heard the Mu Gammas
are trying to recruit you.

509
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:59,733
So are you gonna pledge?

510
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:02,490
Probably not. I don't wanna step.

511
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:05,807
Being in a fraternity is about
a lot more than just stepping.

512
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,969
Wow, you sound just like them.

513
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:14,053
- You should check out Heritage Hall.
- What's that?

514
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,094
See for yourself.

515
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,609
Oh, it's right up here on the right.

516
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:59,648
How does a nice young girl like
yourself know about a place like this?

517
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:01,488
We gonna take five. Be right back.

518
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:04,568
There's a lot of things about me
you don't know.

519
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,407
I didn't know you can do that.
I'm surprised.

520
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:33,248
Let me show you how we do it in A.

521
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,533
All right, I'm not mad.
I'm not mad at all.

522
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:36,765
- Really?
- No.

523
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:41,087
You wanna sit down?

524
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:44,649
No.

525
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:40,247
- I can't do this.
- What's wrong with this?

526
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,010
- We're just having a little fun.
- I know. We just need to go.

527
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:34,494
Let's heat it up!

528
00:49:03,336 --> 00:49:06,373
Yo, this one. Look at the map.
I'm telling you, it's this one.

529
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,210
Quit playing, man.

530
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:15,015
All in!

531
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:53,530
- Since when?
- 1932.

532
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:54,685
Bring it home!

533
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:57,251
Bring it home!

534
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:00,889
Come on!

535
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:06,644
Pledges, turn...

536
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:10,411
...and face big brother Zeuss!

537
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:18,453
Pledges, unmask yourselves!

538
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:28,806
Pledges, Mu Gamma creed!

539
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:31,092
<i>The year of completion,</i>
<i>the manifestation</i>.

540
00:50:31,256 --> 00:50:33,372
<i>1932 was the year our fathers</i>
<i>founded Mu</i>.

541
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:35,891
<i>Camaraderie in grey,</i>
<i>we're a wolf pack of brotherhood</i>.

542
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:39,014
<i>Fangs of power, fur of protection</i>.
<i>Battle cry:</i>

543
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,653
By the rising of the moon!

544
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:45,250
<i>Bring us our destiny, sir!</i>

545
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:55,006
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing,</i>
<i>I wanna be a Theta Nu one day</i>.

546
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:57,815
<i>So big brother,</i>
<i>would you help me on my way?</i>

547
00:50:57,976 --> 00:51:01,935
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!</i>
<i>We gotta keep moving!</i>

548
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:03,290
<i>We gotta keep fighting!</i>

549
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:06,846
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!</i>
<i>We gotta keep moving!</i>

550
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:08,290
<i>We almost there!</i>

551
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:12,968
Pledges of Theta Nu Theta,
face front!

552
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,051
Reveal yourselves!

553
00:51:25,656 --> 00:51:29,365
Pledge Porkchop,
please introduce yourself!

554
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:38,854
Porkchop!

555
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:40,768
Extra gravy.

556
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:48,852
Brother Showtime,
please introduce yourself.

557
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:55,535
Showtime!

558
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:02,325
Pledge Knucklehead,
please introduce yourself.

559
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,055
Knucklehead!

560
00:52:24,616 --> 00:52:25,890
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

561
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:29,093
I'll see you at Nationals.

562
00:52:29,256 --> 00:52:30,484
Yes, you will.

563
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:32,608
- M-U!
<i>- Gamma Xi!</i>

564
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:34,209
- Theta Nu!
<i>- Theta what?</i>

565
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:35,775
- M-U!
<i>- Gamma Xi!</i>

566
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:37,250
- Theta Nu!
<i>- Theta what?</i>

567
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:38,769
- M-U!
<i>- Gamma Xi!</i>

568
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:40,608
- Theta Nu!
<i>- Theta what?</i>

569
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:42,209
- Theta Nu!
<i>- Theta what?</i>

570
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,604
- M-U!
<i>- Gamma Xi!</i>

571
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:45,573
- Theta Nu!
<i>- Theta what?</i>

572
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:53,408
All right. Well, just make sure
it's coming from the dean's office.

573
00:52:56,696 --> 00:52:59,608
Stewart, something's just come up.
I'll have to get back to you.

574
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,848
- No problem.
- You don't have to get off the phone.

575
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,007
Don't be silly. How's my baby?

576
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:06,211
I'm doing good.

577
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:14,048
<i>I heard</i>
<i>that you've been spending tim</i>e...

578
00:53:14,216 --> 00:53:16,446
...<i>with this young man, DJ</i>.

579
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:18,288
Oh, you heard.

580
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,765
So, what, did Grant call you?

581
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:23,166
- Well, we spoke briefly...
- You know what, Dad?

582
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:27,887
Ever since you've introduced me
to Grant, he's all you talk about.

583
00:53:28,056 --> 00:53:31,571
<i>Grant's gonna be a perfect provider,</i>
<i>and oh, Grant's going to the top</i>.

584
00:53:31,736 --> 00:53:33,931
Grant just thinks the world of you.
You know what?

585
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:36,530
How about you and Grant hook up
and leave me out of it?

586
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,209
Watch your tongue, young lady.

587
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:42,412
This is ridiculous.

588
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,087
I gotta go, Dad.

589
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,606
- Hi.
- What's up?

590
00:54:10,616 --> 00:54:11,969
What's wrong?

591
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:15,014
Nothing.

592
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:18,525
Hey, you know,
if you wanna talk, I'm here.

593
00:54:22,656 --> 00:54:23,805
Thanks.

594
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:25,409
All right.

595
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:29,010
Congratulations.

596
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,413
Why didn't you tell me
you pledged?

597
00:54:33,576 --> 00:54:35,453
Maybe I wanted to surprise you.

598
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:38,048
As if I didn't already know.

599
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:45,285
What?

600
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:47,569
I like your earrings. They're nice.

601
00:54:47,736 --> 00:54:50,125
- They're new, right?
- Yeah.

602
00:54:50,696 --> 00:54:52,015
You noticed them?

603
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,651
I notice everything about you.

604
00:54:54,816 --> 00:54:56,408
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

605
00:54:57,896 --> 00:54:59,693
So, what's my favourite colour?

606
00:54:59,856 --> 00:55:01,050
Well...

607
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:03,965
You always wear green eye shadow.

608
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:06,725
Your favourite ring has green in it.

609
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:09,774
And I'm gonna bet your car is green.

610
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,735
Right?

611
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:19,006
We should probably get started.

612
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:21,775
Yeah.

613
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:28,375
<i>Countdown, fellas</i>.

614
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:32,366
For the next six weeks,
we prepare for the step show.

615
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:34,606
Since we don't have time,
other members and I...

616
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:37,973
...will take you through the basics
and break it down for you.

617
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,892
<i>Some of you may think</i>
<i>you know what stepping is</i>.

618
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:43,205
Keep going!

619
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:46,967
<i>- But I assure you</i>...
- Freeze!

620
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:51,527
...<i>until you have stepped</i>
<i>with Theta Nu Theta</i>...<i>you just don't</i>.

621
00:55:52,736 --> 00:55:54,613
One more time.
It's gonna be a long day.

622
00:55:54,776 --> 00:55:55,970
Come on, Thetas!

623
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:57,808
- Move it, move it!
<i>- I will do my part</i>.

624
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:01,244
<i>But I need you to promise</i>
<i>to do yours</i>.

625
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:07,328
<i>From this moment forward,</i>
<i>I will be your Step Master</i>.

626
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:10,251
- Come on. Let's go, baby boy.
<i>- I teach, you learn</i>.

627
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,690
Let's go.

628
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:13,255
Come on.

629
00:56:16,136 --> 00:56:18,650
I'd like to see
a dessert menu, please.

630
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:22,289
So how was your dinner?

631
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:25,285
- It was good.
- Good, good.

632
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:30,371
April, there's been something
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

633
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,685
It belonged to my grandmother.

634
00:56:42,256 --> 00:56:43,974
It's beautiful.

635
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,888
Try it on.

636
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:58,255
Grant...

637
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:04,966
What's my favourite colour?

638
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:07,605
Red. Why?

639
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,815
No, no, no.

640
00:57:11,296 --> 00:57:12,570
Blue.

641
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,413
What's this about?

642
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:19,845
I don't know.

643
00:57:22,976 --> 00:57:26,605
Please tell me this has nothing
to do with that kid.

644
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,488
I'm sorry.

645
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:39,168
If you don't come to your senses
and quick...

646
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:41,725
...you are going to lose out on me.

647
00:57:44,536 --> 00:57:47,050
I really can't believe
you just said that.

648
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:52,654
You are spoiled and ungrateful,
and I'm taking you home.

649
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,408
You know what?

650
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:58,014
Don't bother.

651
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:05,652
My favourite colour's green, asshole.

652
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:13,133
<i>T-H-E-T-A!</i>

653
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:32,568
All right, stop. Stop!

654
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:35,451
Please, put some heart
into what you're doing, fellas.

655
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:36,765
Can I ask a stupid question?

656
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:38,289
Better than anyone I know.

657
00:58:40,136 --> 00:58:41,330
What?

658
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:44,090
I just wanted to know
why we're stepping in an empty pool.

659
00:58:45,576 --> 00:58:48,773
Well, it was so we could keep
our moves a secret.

660
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,575
But who would want them?

661
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,328
Let's pick this back up
tomorrow at 8.

662
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,532
- Eight?
- Eight?

663
00:58:54,696 --> 00:58:56,129
You got a problem with 8?

664
00:58:57,216 --> 00:58:58,444
Let's make it 7.

665
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:01,289
- What?
- Oh, man.

666
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:06,329
I'm out of here.

667
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:09,248
Are they putting this in the show?

668
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:12,286
I don't think so. You know Sylvester.

669
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:15,209
He doesn't like anything street
in his routines.

670
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:17,809
Good.

671
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:20,848
For us.

672
01:00:39,856 --> 01:00:41,767
- Hey.
- Hey.

673
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,289
What's wrong?

674
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,966
I broke up with him.

675
01:00:55,536 --> 01:00:57,208
You okay?

676
01:00:57,856 --> 01:01:00,324
I haven't slept all night.

677
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:05,890
What have you been doing?

678
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:08,254
Thinking.

679
01:01:11,656 --> 01:01:13,487
What are you thinking?

680
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:23,766
I think I wanna come in.

681
01:01:29,656 --> 01:01:31,214
Come on.

682
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:45,048
Don't forget. We gotta practise
on those new steps later on today.

683
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:50,048
Check this out.

684
01:01:53,656 --> 01:01:54,850
Nice ride.

685
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,052
I'll see you guys later.

686
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,372
We'll pick it up first thing
in the morning.

687
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:44,245
If any of you have any conflicts
with your class schedules...

688
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:45,610
...let me know.

689
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:48,135
Prophytes.

690
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:58,085
We have been going strong
for over two weeks now.

691
01:02:58,256 --> 01:02:59,735
And we still suck.

692
01:02:59,896 --> 01:03:01,090
We've got four weeks left.

693
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:02,575
That's easy for you to say.

694
01:03:03,016 --> 01:03:04,847
You can do this stuff in your sleep.

695
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:07,610
The problem is these lame-ass steps
they got us doing, man.

696
01:03:07,976 --> 01:03:09,170
So, what you saying?

697
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:13,090
Instead of us trying to fit step, we
gotta make step fit our natural rhythm.

698
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,609
Here.

699
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:20,410
That's nice.

700
01:03:20,576 --> 01:03:23,090
We're gonna try doing
something like that.

701
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:25,964
- All right, we're gonna try something.
- How do you do that?

702
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,934
Right on the beat.
You just hit it real quick. You go:

703
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,055
Throw it in gear. You come here.

704
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,287
What the hell was that?

705
01:04:02,136 --> 01:04:03,649
The steps you taught us
was played.

706
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:06,489
You can't expect us to beat the Mus
with that and you know it.

707
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:08,169
I'm trying to give something fresh.

708
01:04:08,336 --> 01:04:11,328
Are we doing a step show,
or are we doing a rap video?

709
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:13,293
It's a new day, man.

710
01:04:13,456 --> 01:04:15,606
I mean, I didn't sign on
to be no loser.

711
01:04:15,776 --> 01:04:19,769
No, losing, it's a state of mind.

712
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:22,411
- What?
- No disrespect, my brother.

713
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:25,648
But this frat has been living in that
state for the last seven years.

714
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:27,727
The reason you're holding on
to tradition...

715
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:30,456
...is because you cannot keep up
with the present.

716
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,529
I'll make you a bet.

717
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:37,326
You go and you get
your line brothers together.

718
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:40,012
And I'll get my guys.

719
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,007
And we'll throw down.

720
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:45,769
- You're on.
- Tomorrow night.

721
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:47,967
At the Phoenix.

722
01:04:51,536 --> 01:04:53,492
You sure about this, man?

723
01:04:55,496 --> 01:04:57,373
Yeah, man. I got you.

724
01:04:58,256 --> 01:05:01,487
All right, y'all. We got the brothers
from the TNT step team in the house.

725
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:04,216
Y'all know what it is.
It's the age-old battle.

726
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:08,847
Old school versus new school.
Here come the Neophytes.

727
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:27,094
Time for the Prophytes to counter.

728
01:05:39,256 --> 01:05:40,450
Oh, yeah.

729
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:41,890
Here we go. Here we go.

730
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:44,172
Oh, wait a minute,
they're doing the real thing.

731
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:46,896
They're bringing the real stepping
into the mix.

732
01:05:50,016 --> 01:05:52,928
Okay, what you got for me, fool?
Let me see you bring it.

733
01:05:56,856 --> 01:05:59,768
Hold on, hold on. What's happening
with this kid? What's he doing?

734
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:01,574
Oh, no, that's not gonna fly,
Phoenix.

735
01:06:01,736 --> 01:06:03,806
Y'all know the rules.
Group against group.

736
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:06,171
What are you doing?
Come on, man.

737
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:07,405
This is about the team.

738
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,854
Man, why didn't you stick
with the plan?

739
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:16,415
All my people in the Phoenix.

740
01:06:16,576 --> 01:06:20,489
The prophytes of Theta Nu Theta
wanna show these neos how it's done.

741
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:22,612
Prophytes step together now!

742
01:06:37,736 --> 01:06:38,885
Yeah.

743
01:06:39,056 --> 01:06:41,251
Hands down. No doubt about it.

744
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:43,168
Show some love.
Y'all know what it is.

745
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:46,533
Old school wins. Old school wins.

746
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:51,770
Phoenix, you know you cannot mess
with the prophytes of Theta Nu Theta.

747
01:06:51,936 --> 01:06:54,325
<i>Prophytes! Prophytes! Prophytes!</i>

748
01:07:03,216 --> 01:07:05,605
- Y'all, I was just...
- Look, next time you show off...

749
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:08,848
...do it on your own time, and save us
the practise you put us through.

750
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:10,369
We hardly did any stepping.

751
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:11,969
You know we should have won that.

752
01:07:12,136 --> 01:07:14,809
- It was a slanted crowd. Come on.
- Please.

753
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:18,775
It ain't always about you, dog.

754
01:07:18,936 --> 01:07:20,654
We're a team.

755
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:23,968
Come on, man.

756
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:34,526
<i>It's not just about you,</i>
<i>it's about all of us. We're a team</i>.

757
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:46,775
What's up?

758
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,210
I owe all you guys an apology.

759
01:07:52,056 --> 01:07:54,365
I just wanna be part of the team.

760
01:08:01,296 --> 01:08:02,888
That's good.

761
01:08:03,056 --> 01:08:06,605
Because I'm gonna need you to teach
all of us some of your moves...

762
01:08:06,776 --> 01:08:09,449
...if we're gonna have any kind
of shot at Nationals.

763
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:18,654
Pizzas and beer on me!
I'll take my car. Who else is driving?

764
01:08:41,776 --> 01:08:43,494
<i>M- U!</i>

765
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:46,127

777
01:10:34,656 --> 01:10:36,408
Do your work.

778
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:40,254
I'm done.

779
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:45,335
Well, I still have one more chapter
to read.

780
01:10:50,056 --> 01:10:52,331
<i>Remember you wanted m</i>e
<i>to check up on DJ?</i>

781
01:10:52,496 --> 01:10:57,616
Well, meet
Mr. Darnell James Williams.

782
01:10:58,016 --> 01:10:59,608
"Youth slain in brawl.

783
01:10:59,776 --> 01:11:02,370
Brother and three other youths
charged with assault."

784
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:04,771
All right, come on.

785
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:07,530
I'll take you to the place that makes
the best fried chicken.

786
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,654
With a record like that, you would
think he would keep a low profile.

787
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:14,331
Everyone knows that Darrows fries
the best chicken in all of Georgia.

788
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:16,612
Twenty bills if this ain't the best
fried chicken.

789
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:17,925
- Twenty bills?
- Twenty bills.

790
01:11:18,096 --> 01:11:20,974
So basically,
the brother's a criminal.

791
01:11:22,056 --> 01:11:23,614
What a shame.

792
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:25,850
You're on.

793
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:34,374
I gotta run in and get something
real quick. It'll just take a second.

794
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:36,288
You can come in.

795
01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:38,573
Just trust me. Come on.

796
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,815
Hello?

797
01:11:45,496 --> 01:11:46,975
It's me.

798
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:51,047
- Oh, hey there.
- Hey, Unc.

799
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:54,049
This is my friend, April.

800
01:11:54,216 --> 01:11:55,968
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

801
01:11:56,136 --> 01:11:58,206
- Baby, is that you?
- Yes, it is Sunday, right?

802
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:00,130
Just in time.

803
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:02,366
- And who is this lovely lady?
- April.

804
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:04,208
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

805
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:05,809
Hope you're hungry.

806
01:12:06,536 --> 01:12:09,653
You can set your watch by my Aunt
Jackie's Sunday night fried chicken.

807
01:12:15,656 --> 01:12:17,772
Those are the most beautiful tulips.

808
01:12:17,936 --> 01:12:19,335
- Thank you, baby.
- You're welcome.

809
01:12:19,496 --> 01:12:20,690
They are my favourite.

810
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:24,610
Nate brings them for me every Sunday
since the day we were engaged.

811
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:26,892
- Isn't that sweet?
- Are you taking notes?

812
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:28,330
See? See what you started?

813
01:12:28,496 --> 01:12:30,726
- I mess up a lot.
- Yes, you do.

814
01:12:30,896 --> 01:12:33,410
Listen, guys, there's plenty more
so don't be shy.

815
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:36,488
Yes, this is the best chicken
I've had.

816
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:38,055
Thank you.

817
01:12:38,216 --> 01:12:40,207
Your cooking actually reminds me
of my mom's.

818
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,055
She must be a damn good cook.

819
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:46,528
She was a good cook.
She passed away five years ago.

820
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,766
I'm sorry to hear that.

821
01:12:49,376 --> 01:12:51,128
Yeah, it was tough.

822
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:54,572
But, you know,
me and my dad are real close.

823
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:57,204
Her dad's the provost.

824
01:12:58,776 --> 01:13:00,812
- <i>El capitán</i>.
- Yep.

825
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:04,127
- You're Palmer's daughter?
- Yeah.

826
01:13:08,536 --> 01:13:11,892
Auntie, when are you gonna teach me
how to make this fried chicken?

827
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:14,012
- I'm not gonna do it, sweetheart.
- Why?

828
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,406
Because then I'll never see you
on Sunday anymore...

829
01:13:16,576 --> 01:13:18,851
...and I need to see my boy
every Sunday.

830
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:35,332
Five, six...

831
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:39,171
...seven, eight.

Mr. Darnell James Williams,
you're wanted in the Dean's Office.

838
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:34,044
According to the information
provided to us...

839
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:37,128
...you were charged with
and convicted of aggravated assault...

840
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:40,368
...in a brawl that resulted
in the death of your brother.

841
01:14:40,536 --> 01:14:41,969
Is this correct?

842
01:14:43,936 --> 01:14:46,131
I was trying to protect him.

843
01:14:47,736 --> 01:14:50,455
The thing is, if I had told you
the truth about my conviction...

844
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:52,527
...I wouldn't be here anyway.

845
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:54,652
So either way,
I was screwed from the get-go.

846
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:57,772
So I guess the only thing
left to say is that...

847
01:15:00,056 --> 01:15:04,686
...since I've been here,
I've become a better person.

848
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:31,610
It is the decision of this committee...

849
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:34,085
...to suspend you
for the remainder of the year.

850
01:15:35,896 --> 01:15:38,171
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams.

851
01:15:50,056 --> 01:15:51,284
Yo, DJ!

852
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:01,175
D?

853
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:14,175
You all right, man?
What's going on?

854
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:18,574
- I'm out of here.
- What are you talking about?

855
01:16:18,736 --> 01:16:19,930
I'm suspended.

856
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,692
How the hell can they do that?

857
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:31,729
Hello?

858
01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:33,974
Yeah, this is him.

859
01:16:36,016 --> 01:16:37,335
When?

860
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,529
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there.

861
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,654
D, what's going on? D!

862
01:16:51,496 --> 01:16:53,054
Come in.

863
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:56,647
Excuse me, Dr. Palmer.
DJ Williams.

864
01:16:57,336 --> 01:16:59,566
Have a seat, Mr. Williams.

865
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:07,011
The Ethics Committee
reports to my office...

866
01:17:08,296 --> 01:17:11,254
...but I seldom interfere
with their decisions.

867
01:17:11,936 --> 01:17:16,248
I have the authority
to have you reinstated.

868
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:20,485
So, what's the catch?

869
01:17:20,656 --> 01:17:25,730
This thing you have going
with my daughter, it ends now.

870
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:29,206
- What does that have to do with...?
- Look, you little shit.

871
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:33,131
My daughter is not some shorty
for you to mess with.

872
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:35,890
She's a woman with a bright
and promising future...

873
01:17:36,056 --> 01:17:39,366
...and I'm not gonna have you
come here and take advantage of her.

874
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:41,731
- Excuse me?
- Am I not getting through to you?

875
01:17:44,136 --> 01:17:48,766
If you don't agree
to stop seeing my daughter...

876
01:17:48,976 --> 01:17:51,206
...you can kiss
your education goodbye.

877
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:57,852
And you'll end up just like your uncle,
cutting grass for a living.

878
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:01,456
Now, how long do you think
April will go out with you then?

879
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:06,214
Well...

880
01:18:07,256 --> 01:18:09,053
With all due respect...

881
01:18:10,776 --> 01:18:12,334
...sir...

882
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:17,215
...it's her decision, not yours.

883
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:21,093
You have a good day.

884
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:28,454
Three days before the Nationals.

885
01:18:29,256 --> 01:18:32,328
Are you sure there's nothing we can
do to help change Dr. Palmer's mind?

886
01:18:32,496 --> 01:18:35,010
- No, he's one of them.
- Palmer's a Mu Gamma?

887
01:18:35,896 --> 01:18:38,251
- That's right.
- Damn.

888
01:18:38,696 --> 01:18:39,765
We are screwed.

889
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:45,484
You guys are unbelievable, man.

890
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:51,125
You will be leaving here in three,
what, four years...

891
01:18:51,296 --> 01:18:53,730
...with your fancy job offers
in your pockets.

892
01:18:54,456 --> 01:18:56,970
It's my ass getting kicked
to the kerb, man.

893
01:18:57,136 --> 01:18:59,775
This is my life that's messed up.

894
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,809
This is not about
no damn Nationals.

895
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:18,210
Did he tell you
he has a criminal record?

896
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:20,295
What criminal record?

897
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:22,333
And I suppose he hasn't told you...

898
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,294
...that he's been brought up
before the Ethics Committee...

899
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,651
...for lying on his
scholarship application?

900
01:19:27,816 --> 01:19:30,046
What are you talking about?

901
01:19:43,576 --> 01:19:45,726
I was just about to call you.

902
01:19:51,616 --> 01:19:53,572
So it's true.

903
01:19:56,976 --> 01:19:59,012
What do you want me
to say to you, April?

904
01:19:59,176 --> 01:20:00,973
I believed in you.

905
01:20:01,576 --> 01:20:03,965
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

906
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,491
I got arrested because I was...

907
01:20:11,336 --> 01:20:13,486
Because I was fighting
and my brother got killed.

908
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:17,735
It wasn't my fault. The only
reason I got convicted was...

909
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,854
...because I had a public defender who
couldn't even remember my name.

910
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:26,652
Then why are you leaving?

911
01:20:26,976 --> 01:20:28,773
Good question.

912
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,213
Why don't you go ask your father?

913
01:20:39,976 --> 01:20:41,887
He would have given me back
my scholarship...

914
01:20:42,056 --> 01:20:43,728
...had I agreed to break up with her.

915
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:45,887
And you said no?

916
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:48,126
I wasn't gonna let him play me.

917
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:53,767
- It was my fault.
- I don't get it.

918
01:21:02,336 --> 01:21:05,408
I dated Will Palmer back at Truth.

919
01:21:05,576 --> 01:21:09,091
My junior and most of my senior year
until I met your uncle.

920
01:21:12,616 --> 01:21:16,609
- You stole his girl?
- It's not that simple.

921
01:21:21,216 --> 01:21:25,892
I wish you would've told me that
before it blew up in my face.

922
01:21:30,776 --> 01:21:32,767
What's up, world?
This is Sway with <i>MTV News</i>.

923
01:21:32,936 --> 01:21:34,415
Coming to you live from Atlanta...

924
01:21:34,576 --> 01:21:37,295
...for the 17th Annual Step Show
Championships.

925
01:21:39,976 --> 01:21:43,605
The Atlanta Arena will be overflowing
as thousands of fans have gathered...

926
01:21:43,776 --> 01:21:45,607
...from far and wide
for the competition.

927
01:21:46,256 --> 01:21:47,848
Hundreds of applications
poured in...

928
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:50,530
...but only 25 teams
were chosen from universities...

929
01:21:50,696 --> 01:21:55,053
...from all across the country
to compete in the ultimate showdown.

930
01:21:59,176 --> 01:22:01,736
This year, defending champions
Mu Gamma Xi...

931
01:22:01,896 --> 01:22:05,366
...go for their unprecedented
eighth title in a row.

932
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:08,289
Is there anybody
that can stop these guys?

933
01:22:11,336 --> 01:22:12,485
Seven-year champs!

934
01:22:12,696 --> 01:22:15,494
Eight is on the way, baby.
Eight is on the way.

935
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:18,005
Hey. Hey, Thetas, turn.
Get over here.

936
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:20,929
Come on, fellas.
I know what you're thinking.

937
01:22:21,096 --> 01:22:24,611
But you're wrong.
Come on, we can still win this thing.

938
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:26,334
Okay, now, I've been watching you.

939
01:22:26,496 --> 01:22:27,645
And I can promise you...

940
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:30,410
...we are not the same Thetas
that we were six weeks ago.

941
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,771
You ain't never seen stepping
like this before.

942
01:22:32,936 --> 01:22:35,131
So get ready. It's about to go down!

943
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,014
- Let's go!
- You ready?

944
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:39,167
- All right.
- Let's go.

945
01:22:39,336 --> 01:22:41,725
Let's go. Let's go.
Theta on three. One, two, three.

946
01:22:41,896 --> 01:22:42,616
<i>Theta!</i>

947
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:47,928
Hello, William.

948
01:22:52,096 --> 01:22:54,485
It's been a long time, Jackie.

949
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,769
- William, how could you?
- Look, if this is about...

950
01:22:57,936 --> 01:22:59,972
DJ told us about the deal
that you offered him.

951
01:23:00,136 --> 01:23:01,649
All I'm trying to do is make sure...

952
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:04,410
...my daughter doesn't make
the same mistake you made.

953
01:23:05,256 --> 01:23:07,008
I didn't make a mistake, William.

954
01:23:08,256 --> 01:23:10,008
You know how different
your life would be...

955
01:23:10,176 --> 01:23:11,814
If I would have married you?

956
01:23:12,736 --> 01:23:15,296
William, I have a really good life.

957
01:23:15,936 --> 01:23:18,814
Well, it's not good enough
for my daughter.

958
01:23:19,696 --> 01:23:22,051
Shouldn't that be my choice?

959
01:23:32,656 --> 01:23:37,366
Dad, if you think me being with Grant
is what's best for me...

960
01:23:38,536 --> 01:23:42,495
...then you don't even really know me.
- Baby, you are all I have left.

961
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:45,248
Well, you just lost that.

962
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,805
- Look, sweetheart, don't say that.
- Just stop it.

963
01:23:47,976 --> 01:23:51,525
I know I can forgive you for this
one day, but I really...

964
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,204
I really can't imagine when.

965
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:59,132
Just give me a chance to fix things.

966
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,615
The procedure is simple.

967
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,573
Teams compete
in an elimination round.

968
01:24:09,736 --> 01:24:12,091
Only four teams
are chosen to go to the finals.

969
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,771
These four teams will compete
for the $40,000 grand prize...

970
01:24:15,936 --> 01:24:18,609
...to use for the community service
project of their choice.

971
01:24:18,776 --> 01:24:22,974
And let's not forget,
bragging rights for the year.

972
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:28,169
Let the elimination rounds begin.

973
01:25:55,856 --> 01:25:59,531
Let's hear it for the sorority finalists.

974
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:05,531
Let's hear it
for the fraternity finalists.

975
01:26:06,296 --> 01:26:08,526
This is us, fellas.
Get them pythons up.

976
01:26:10,656 --> 01:26:12,135
Hi.

977
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:15,167
- Is he here?
- Sure, sure.

978
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:18,487
Hold on one second.
DJ, would you come down?

979
01:26:36,376 --> 01:26:39,254
I know about the offer
that my dad made.

980
01:26:41,776 --> 01:26:44,165
All you had to do was talk to me.

981
01:26:44,776 --> 01:26:48,610
- I know.
- I should have stayed in L.A.

982
01:26:49,896 --> 01:26:52,456
Everything I touch gets screwed up.

983
01:26:54,896 --> 01:26:57,330
My brother's dead and that's on me.

984
01:26:57,496 --> 01:26:59,327
DJ...

985
01:27:01,176 --> 01:27:03,326
That's not true.

986
01:27:03,496 --> 01:27:06,568
No, if it wasn't for me, he'd be here.
Duron would be here.

987
01:27:07,496 --> 01:27:09,009
Let it go.

988
01:27:12,536 --> 01:27:14,845
Just let it go.

989
01:27:20,856 --> 01:27:22,687
It's okay.

990
01:27:26,936 --> 01:27:28,892
I love you.

991
01:27:36,456 --> 01:27:40,449
It's not your fault. Okay?

992
01:27:45,216 --> 01:27:46,695
Okay, I want to tell you something.

993
01:27:48,616 --> 01:27:52,814
My dad overturned
the committee's decision.

994
01:27:54,456 --> 01:27:59,655
He'd much rather put up with you
in my life than lose me in his.

995
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:04,608
But I don't know if that's for me.

996
01:28:05,336 --> 01:28:06,894
But I thought this was your dream.

997
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,851
It's my brother's dream.

998
01:28:11,616 --> 01:28:15,370
He was supposed to be this.
Not me.

999
01:28:17,016 --> 01:28:19,405
Well, then do it for your brother.

1000
01:28:20,776 --> 01:28:23,051
Do it for Duron.

1001
01:28:25,576 --> 01:28:28,648
The elimination rounds are over
and only the finalists remain.

1002
01:28:28,816 --> 01:28:32,695
This is the last chance for these teams
to let out all the stops.

1003
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:35,933
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

1004
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:40,647
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1005
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:44,326
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

1006
01:28:44,496 --> 01:28:47,010
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1007
01:28:47,176 --> 01:28:50,566
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

1008
01:28:50,736 --> 01:28:53,694
...for thine is the kingdom, the power,
the glory forever.

1009
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:56,287
Amen.

1010
01:28:57,136 --> 01:28:59,809
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the defending champions...

1011
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:05,334
...the unstoppable
brothers of Mu Gamma Xi.

1012
01:29:23,576 --> 01:29:24,975
Wolf pack launch!

1013
01:29:31,976 --> 01:29:33,534
Give it to me one time.

1014
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,175
Give it to me two times.

1015
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,655
Give it to me three times.

1016
01:29:50,016 --> 01:29:51,369
Wolf pack slide.

1019
01:31:31,696 --> 01:31:35,086
Sylvester!
I can't let you save the best for last.

1020
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,292
Because the crowd
out there is really feeling us.

1021
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:39,924
Man, what's it to you, dog?
Why don't you mind your own...?

1022
01:31:40,096 --> 01:31:42,291
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's go.
- All right.

1023
01:31:51,096 --> 01:31:52,370
You're suspended.

1024
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:57,575
It seems like your man Dr. Palmer
changed his mind.

1025
01:31:58,656 --> 01:32:00,647
You're not gonna matter.

1026
01:32:02,536 --> 01:32:03,764
You never did.

1027
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,370
Come on, Mus.
Where's my Mus at?

1028
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:08,015
So this is for real? You're back?

1029
01:32:08,176 --> 01:32:09,609
Theta Nu, you're on.

1030
01:32:09,776 --> 01:32:11,573
All right, huddle up,
huddle up, huddle up.

1031
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:13,886
Okay, now, we are TNT.

1032
01:32:14,056 --> 01:32:16,490
That's one of the most powerful
explosives known to man.

1033
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:17,975
- And that's what we are.
- Right.

1034
01:32:18,136 --> 01:32:19,854
That's what you are.
That's what you are.

1035
01:32:20,016 --> 01:32:23,088
That's damn sure what you are,
and that is what we have always been.

1036
01:32:23,256 --> 01:32:26,054
Okay, so tonight,
can we be explosive?

1037
01:32:26,216 --> 01:32:27,649
- Yes!
- No, no.

1038
01:32:27,816 --> 01:32:29,454
Can we be better
than we ever have been?

1039
01:32:29,616 --> 01:32:32,892
- Yes!
- Because we are repping the Thetas.

1040
01:32:33,056 --> 01:32:35,490
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas</i>.

1041
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:38,090
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas</i>.

1042
01:32:38,256 --> 01:32:39,735
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep th</i>e.<i>:</i>

1043
01:32:42,816 --> 01:32:47,936
And now, get ready for the brothers
of Theta Nu Theta!

1044
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:46,091
<i>T-H-E-T-A!</i>

1045
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:49,287
<i>Theta Nu!</i>

1046
01:34:20,936 --> 01:34:24,975
<i>I got a feeling</i>
<i>Can't touch this!</i>

1047
01:34:44,296 --> 01:34:45,524
All ours, we get.

1048
01:36:05,256 --> 01:36:07,087
All right. That's it for the finals.

1049
01:36:07,256 --> 01:36:09,816
Now it's all up to the judges.

1050
01:36:25,656 --> 01:36:27,965
And now for the winner
of this year's...

1051
01:36:28,136 --> 01:36:30,445
...National Fraternity
Step Team Champions...

1052
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,730
We have a tie.

1053
01:36:36,856 --> 01:36:38,528
Now, I know
what you all are thinking...

1054
01:36:38,696 --> 01:36:40,891
...but the judges
will not let this end in a tie.

1055
01:36:41,056 --> 01:36:44,048
I'm gonna stay here live until
we have a definitive winner.

1056
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:46,252
Alpha Tau Chapter
of Mu Gamma Xi...

1057
01:36:49,496 --> 01:36:52,135
...and Beta Delta Chapter
of Theta Nu Theta.

1058
01:36:52,296 --> 01:36:56,448
We're gonna let y'all go
head-to-head one more time.

1059
01:36:58,376 --> 01:37:02,289
Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi,
are y'all ready to battle?

1060
01:37:04,816 --> 01:37:07,888
- Then let's go!
- Come here.

1061
01:37:10,936 --> 01:37:12,813
All right.
We're gonna need you, man.

1062
01:37:12,976 --> 01:37:15,490
We're gonna need you
to bring this home for us.

1063
01:37:15,656 --> 01:37:18,728
You waited for four years for this.
You need to be the one leading us.

1064
01:37:18,896 --> 01:37:20,807
- I'm not doing it.
- It's not about you, okay?

1065
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,490
It's not about me.
It's about the whole team.

1066
01:37:34,496 --> 01:37:36,964
- That's my man.
- Bring him in here. Let's go.

1067
01:37:37,136 --> 01:37:39,604
It looks like DJ is gonna lead them.

1068
01:37:41,016 --> 01:37:42,734
I knew they was gonna do this.

1069
01:37:42,896 --> 01:37:45,615
Don't worry.
I've been studying his every move.

1070
01:37:45,776 --> 01:37:48,415
It'll be like taking candy
from a baby.

1071
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:51,047
All right. It's all you.

1072

This competition
has entered the battle zone.

These two teams are relentless.

1097
01:41:00,536 --> 01:41:04,131
I don't know about you, but I've
never seen stepping like this before.
