2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
Although each of the world's countries

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,620
would like to dispute this fact,

4
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,119
we French know the truth:

5
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,520
The best food in the world
is made in France.

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,619
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,219
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,719
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,520
booked five months in advance.

10
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,320
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,719
has made his competitors envious.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,119
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,420
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,619
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,020
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

16
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,019
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,819
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

18
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,420
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,319
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:28,019
<font color=yellow><u>sazu489.blogspot.com</u></font>

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,819
<font color=yellow><u>sazu489.blogspot.com</u></font>

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,620
This is me.

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,420
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
What's my problem?

25
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,120
First of all, I'm a rat.

26
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,719
Which means life is hard.

27
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,319
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

28
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,120
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

29
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,319
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

30
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,120
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

31
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,620
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

32
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,319
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,420
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,819
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,319
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,620
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

37
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,620
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

38
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,120
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

39
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,620
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,

40
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,120
until dad gave me a job.

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,919
Clean.

42
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,219
Clean.

43
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,719
That's right. Poison checker.

44
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,919
Cleanerific.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
Cleanerino.

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,719
Close to godliness.

47
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,020
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

48
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,919
Never mind. Move on.

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,520
Well, it made my dad proud.

50
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,219
Now, don't you feel better, Remy, eh?
You've helped a noble cause.

51
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,920
Noble? We-we're thieves, Dad.

52
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,620
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

53
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,719
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

54
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,319
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

55
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,420
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,020
This much I knew:

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,020
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

58
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,719
But to my dad...

59
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,920
Food is fuel.

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,620
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

61
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,319
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,920
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

63
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,920
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,620
where nothing is poisoned?

65
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,219
First of all, we are not thieves.

66
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,219
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
It's dangerous.

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,419
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
but there's something about them.

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,020
They-they don't just survive.
They discover, they create.

71
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,520
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.

72
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,120
How can I describe it?

73
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.

74
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,720
There is excellence all around you.

75
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,420
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

76
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,519
Oh, Gusteau was right.

77
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,319
Oh, mmm, yeah.

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,319
Oh, amazing.

79
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:42,220
Each flavor was totally unique.

80
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,519
But combine one flavor with another,

81
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,319
and something new was created.

82
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,519
So now I had a secret life.

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,019
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.

84
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,519
Hey, Emile. Emile.

85
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,819
I found a mushroom.

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,220
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,819
He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,620
Why are you walking like that?

89
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

90
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,819
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

91
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
that we handle food with?

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,319
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

93
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,519
- All the time.
- Uh...

94
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,120
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

95
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,420
Well, go ahead.

96
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,120
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not gonna like it.

97
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,220
What have you got there?

98
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,519
Ah, oh, oh...

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,620
You found cheese?

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,519
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chčvre de pays!

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,220
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

102
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,220
And...

103
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,519
Oh! And, and, and, and, oh...

104
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,720
This rosemary! This rosemary... uh, with, uh...

105
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,420
maybe... maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'II... You know...

107
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,420
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

108
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,220
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

109
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,819
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,019
Emile!

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,019
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

112
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,620
We-we gotta cook this.

113
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

114
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah.

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,319
The key is to keep turning it.

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,819
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

117
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,319
That storm's getting closer.

118
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,319
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

119
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,620
Ohh... You got to taste this!

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,019
This is... Oh, it's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,019
It's not really a smoky taste.
It-it's a certain... Oh, it's kind of like a...

122
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,120
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,420
- Wha-what would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,120
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
Oh, we got to do that again.

125
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,920
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

126
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,519
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

127
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,120
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

128
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,120
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,220
- Saffron.
- Not good.

130
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,819
Saffron. Hmm...

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

132
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,319
I've been down here a million times.

133
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,519
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

134
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,620
You've been here a million times?

135
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,319
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,420
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

137
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,720
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

138
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,720
Wait, wait, wait... You read?

139
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,620
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,319
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

141
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,519
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't like secrets.

143
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,019
All this cooking
and, and, and reading and TV-watching

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,420
while we read and cook.

145
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,620
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

146
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,220
Why do I let you?

147
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,919
What's taking those kids so long?

148
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,019
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

149
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,820
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

150
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,620
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.

151
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,220
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,720
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

153
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,820
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

154
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,519
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.

155
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
You must try things that may not work.

156
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,919
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

157
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,120
because of where you come from.

158
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,519
Your only limit is your soul.

159
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,620
What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.

160
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
Pure poetry.

161
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
But it was not to last.

162
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,120
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars

163
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,820
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.

164
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,519
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,

165
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,720
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,919
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
Gusteau is dead?

168
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,519
Oh!

169
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,220
Oh! Oh!

170
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,419
Oh!

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,919
Run!

172
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,620
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

173
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,320
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,620
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

175
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,320
Try to grab you.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,620
Emile, swing to me.

177
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

178
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,720
- Let me through! let me through!
- The book.

179
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,820
Excuse me. Move, move.

180
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,320
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

181
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,120
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

182
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,220
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

183
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:39,919
Push off. Come on.

184
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,120
Get hold!

185
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,820
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

186
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,419
Hey, wait for me!

187
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,519
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

188
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,120
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

189
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,019
I'm coming!

190
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,919
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

191
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

192
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,120
Come on. Reach for it.

193
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,320
You can do it.

194
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,919
- Remy!
- Dad!

195
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,820
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

196
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,720
Guys, wait. Stop!

197
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,919
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

198
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,720
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

199
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,519
Dad?

200
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,620
Dad?

201
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,019
Which way?

202
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,919
I waited

203
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,820
for a sound,

204
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,720
a voice,

205
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,519
a sign,

206
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,419
something.

207
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,019
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

208
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why do you wait and mope?

209
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,019
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

210
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,720
probably forever.

211
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,820
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

212
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,220
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

213
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,120
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are Ionely.

214
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,419
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

215
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,919
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

216
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,720
If you focus on what you've left behind,

217
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,220
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

218
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,519
Now go up and look around.

219
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,220
Oh!

220
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,820
Champagne!

221
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,320
What are you doing?

222
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,620
I'm hungry.

223
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,220
I don't know where I am,

224
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,019
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

225
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

226
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,820
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

227
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,220
But I am hungry.

228
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,519
Food will come, Remy.

229
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,220
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

230
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,620
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

231
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,119
Paris?

232
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,220
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

233
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,519
Wow.

234
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,019
It's beautiful.

235
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,819
The most beautiful.

236
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,720
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

237
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,220
You've led me to your restaurant.

238
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,519
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

239
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,019
I got to see this.

240
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,220
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

241
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,019
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

242
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,819
I need
more soup bowls, please.

243
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,519
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

244
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,920
I need two salmon, three
salade composite, and three filet.

245
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,920
Three orders
of salade composite working.

246
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,720
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

247
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,220
Three filet working. I need plates.

248
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,119
Fire seven.
Three salade composite up.

249
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,119
Don't mess with my mise!

250
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,519
Open down low.

251
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,519
I'm getting buried here.

252
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,420
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

253
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,519
Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

254
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,119
- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.

255
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,119
Hey, boss, look who is here.

256
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,619
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

257
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,319
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

258
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,920
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

259
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,420
- Ah... Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

260
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,720
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

261
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,619
- My mother?
- Renata.

262
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,619
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

263
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,319
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

264
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,619
She died.

265
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,420
Oh.

266
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,619
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

268
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,319
You know, afterlife-wise?

269
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,220
- What's this?
- Uh, she left it for you.

270
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,819
I think she hoped it would help me,

271
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,319
you know, get a job here.

272
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,019
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

273
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,220
Any son of Renata's is more than...

274
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

275
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,119
We have already hired him.

276
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,920
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

277
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,819
We needed a garbage boy.

278
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,920
Oh, garbage. Well...

279
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,819
I'm glad it worked out.

280
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,319
Uh...

281
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,019
I can't believe it.

282
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,420
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

283
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,720
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

284
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,519
Which one is the chef?

285
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,519
Oh! Uh...

286
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,319
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

287
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,019
Who is next in command?

288
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,920
The sous chef. There.

289
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,119
- Uh, the sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.
- Hmm!

290
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,819
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important. Uh...

291
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,119
...chef de partie, uh, demi chef de partie,
both important. Uh...

292
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,019
- ...commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.
- Ah!

293
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,319
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

294
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,119
Oh, him? He's nobody.

295
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,319
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

296
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,220
No, he's a plongeur or something.

297
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,819
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

298
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,220
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

299
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,519
How do you know?
What do I always say?

300
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:34,220
Anyone can cook.

301
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,319
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

302
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,920
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

303
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,420
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

304
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,819
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

305
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,920
It's your restaurant. Do something.

306
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,220
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

307
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,519
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

308
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,220
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

309
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,420
Table five coming up,
right now.

310
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,619
- Coming down the line.
- Set.

311
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,420
Ah!

312
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Hot! Open oven!

313
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,720
Ah!

314
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,019
Coming around.

315
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,220
Ooh!

316
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,019
Yes, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

317
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,220
Fire those soufflés
for table six, Yah.

318
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,319
- Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

319
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,119
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

320
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,720
It has a wonderful finish.

321
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,019
- Ooh!
- Ah!

322
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,319
Hmm.

323
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,519
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

324
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:12,720
Yes, chef.

325
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,319
Remy! What are you waiting for?

326
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,319
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

327
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,019
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

328
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,319
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

329
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,019
Move it, garbage boy!

330
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,319
You are cooking?

331
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,019
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

332
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,119
Where do you get the gall

333
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,920
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

334
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,019
I should have you drawn
and quartered! I...i...i...

335
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,220
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

336
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,319
Oh, no! oh...

337
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,819
- Larousse, draw and quarter this man...
- Oh, no...

338
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,119
- after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.
- Oh! No...

339
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,319
- What are you blathering about?
- Th...The soup!

340
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,920
Soup?

341
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,220
Stop that soup!

342
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,220
No!

343
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,720
Uh... waiter.

344
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,619
Linguini!

345
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:03,319
You're fired!

346
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,420
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!

347
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,819
She wants to see the chef.

348
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,019
But he... he... em... em...

349
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,319
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

350
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,519
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

351
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:36,720
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

352
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,519
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

353
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,220
- You're the reason I'm in this mess.
- Shh... shh... shh.

354
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,720
Someone is asking about your soup.

355
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,420
- What are you playing at?
- I... um...

356
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,119
Am I still fired?

357
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,319
- You can't fire him.
- What?

358
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,720
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

359
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,119
If she write a review to that effect

360
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

361
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,519
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

362
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,819
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

363
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,119
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

364
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,119
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?

365
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
"Anyone can cook."

366
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,819
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

367
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,420
He has taken a bold risk

368
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,920
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

369
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,319
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

370
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,819
who are we to deny him?

371
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,319
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,519
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

373
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,019
you shall be responsible for it.

374
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,619
Anyone else, hmm?

375
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,420
Then back to work.

376
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,720
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

377
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,319
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

378
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,319
Very close attention.

379
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,019
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

380
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,619
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

381
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,119
Rat!

382
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,119
- Rat!
- Get the rat.

383
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,319
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

384
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,019
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

385
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,619
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

386
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,319
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

387
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,019
Do you know what would happen to us

388
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,519
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

389
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,319
They'd close us down.

390
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,819
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

391
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,019
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

392
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:50,319
Whoa!

393
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Doh!

394
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,519
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

395
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:30,720
They expect me to cook it again!

396
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,720
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

397
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,019
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

398
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,119
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

399
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,119
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Ro... uh, Rosemary?

400
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,920
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

401
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,920
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

402
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,319
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

403
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,019
Gah...

404
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,720
I need this job. I've lost so many.

405
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,220
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

406
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,420
Haa!

407
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,720
Did you nod?

408
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:10,920
Have, have you been nodding?

409
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,119
You understand me?

410
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,319
So I'm not crazy! Ha!

411
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,720
Wait a second, wait a second. Uh...

412
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,420
I can't cook, can I?

413
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,119
But you...

414
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,619
You can, right?

415
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,319
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

416
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,819
Whatever you did, they liked it.

417
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,019
Yeah. This could work.

418
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,119
Hey, they liked the soup! Eeh...

419
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:50,619
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

420
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,720
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

421
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,619
But we're together on this. Right?

422
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,819
Okay.

423
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,019
So this... this is it.

424
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,420
I mean, it-it's uh, it's not much, but it's uh,
you know... uh...

425
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:23,920
Not much.

426
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,720
It could be worse.

427
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,220
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

428
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,720
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

429
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,119
Are you...

430
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,519
Is this a dream?

431
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,920
The best kind of dream.

432
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,519
One we can share.

433
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,319
But why here?

434
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,420
Why now?

435
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,019
Why not here?

436
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,019
Why not now?

437
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,920
What better place to dream
than in Paris?

438
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,319
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and Shi...

439
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,019
Oh, no.

440
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,319
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

441
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,220
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

442
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,519
Eggs, gone!

443
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,019
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

444
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,619
That's what I get for trusting a Ra...

445
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,220
Whoa... a...

446
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,019
Hi. Is that for me?

447
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,920
Mmm!

448
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,720
That's good. Wha-what did you put in this?

449
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,319
Where'd you get that?

450
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,220
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

451
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,920
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

452
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,220
Come on, Little Chef!

453
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,319
"Though I, like many other critic,

454
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,719
had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

455
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,420
the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

456
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,519
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes! - LeClaire.

457
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,119
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

458
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,019
Only time will tell if they deserve it."

459
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,219
Well, uh...

460
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,320
You know.

461
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,519
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

462
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,119
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

463
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,820
So let's do this thing!

464
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,119
I...

465
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:13,019
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

466
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:17,019
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

467
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,820
Soup.

468
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,619
Ow! You little...

469
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,920
Ow!

470
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:45,820
You son of a...

471
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,519
You got...

472
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,019
This is not gonna work, Little Chef!

473
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,619
I'm gonna lose it
if we do this anymore.

474
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,219
We've gotta, We've gotta figure out something else.

475
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,519
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

476
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,320
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

477
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,119
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

478
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,420
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

479
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,820
Little Chef?

480
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:35,719
Oh, you're hungry.

481
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,519
Okay. So let's think this out.

482
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,119
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear uh...

483
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
human.

484
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,920
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

485
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,119
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

486
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,320
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

487
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,420
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

488
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,320
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

489
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
We gotta communicate.

490
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,719
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a Ra...

491
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,519
The rat! I saw it!

492
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,820
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

493
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,619
What are you doing in here?

494
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,820
I-i'm just uh, familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

495
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,219
Get out.

496
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,219
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

497
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,019
That was close. Are you okay up there?

498
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,719
Whoa!

499
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,920
How did you do that?

500
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,019
Whoa...

501
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,420
That's strangely involuntary!

502
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,519
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.

503
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,019
Okay.

504
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,320
Huh?

505
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:21,619
Ow!

506
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,619
Ooh... wh.. uh...

507
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:29,420
Where-where are you taking me? Wait.

508
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,119
Whoa!

509
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,920
Wait. I'm sorry.

510
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,619
Whoa!

511
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:45,719
Okay.

512
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,920
Mmm-hmm...

513
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,719
Okay.

514
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,619
Whoa!

515
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,119
Whoa!

516
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:57,920
To your health!

517
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,119
All right.

518
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,320
That should do it.

519
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,019
Mmm.

520
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,119
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success, Mm-hm.

521
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:46,920
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

522
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:51,519
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

523
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,019
Listen, I just want you to know

524
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,920
how honored I am
to be studying under such uhh...

525
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,420
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

526
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,920
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

527
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,320
Well, I...

528
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,820
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

529
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,119
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

530
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,920
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

531
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:15,420
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

532
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,820
- But still I'm here. How did this happen?

533
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,519
Because, well, because you, uh, whoa...

534
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,820
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

535
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,519
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

536
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,619
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

537
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,920
Got it?

538
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:33,619
Wow!

539
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,519
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

540
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,619
Chine-easy.

541
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:46,320
- Excellent work, François, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

542
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:50,719
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

543
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,019
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

544
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,719
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

545
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,019
What are corn dogs?

546
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:03,519
- Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American. - Mm-mm.

547
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,920
Whip something up.

548
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:08,619
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

549
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,920
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

550
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:15,920
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

551
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,719
Get my lawyer!

552
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,719
Well, the will stipulates

553
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,619
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

554
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,019
no heir appears,

555
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,420
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

556
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,519
I know what the will stipulates.

557
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:03,820
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

558
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,019
There's not much resemblance.

559
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,619
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

560
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,920
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

561
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:20,320
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

562
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,619
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

563
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,619
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

564
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,219
Highly suspect!

565
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,219
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

566
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,920
- May I?
- Of course. Of course.

567
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,420
But the boy does not know.

568
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,920
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

569
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:43,019
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

570
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,019
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

571
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,619
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

572
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,719
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

573
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,619
Find out how much of this is real.

574
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:56,320
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

575
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,119
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

576
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,619
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

577
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,619
He knows something.

578
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,820
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

579
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,320
- What are you doing?
- Uh... uh... uh...

580
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

581
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,219
No! You waste energy and time!

582
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
You think cooking is a cute job, eh,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

583
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,519
Well, Mommy never had to face

584
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,219
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

585
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,820
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

586
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,219
and all of the different cooking times,

587
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,519
but must arrive on the customer's table

588
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,719
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

589
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,519
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

590
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,320
What is this? Keep your station clear!

591
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,119
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

592
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:45,719
Messy stations slow things down.

593
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,119
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

594
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,920
I'll make this easy to remember.

595
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,519
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

596
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,920
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

597
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,719
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

598
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,920
Always return to this position.

599
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:05,619
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

600
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:08,619
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

601
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,320
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

602
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,219
I know the Gusteau style cold.

603
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,619
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

604
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,619
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

605
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,519
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

606
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,019
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

607
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,420
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

608
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,519
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

609
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,019
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

610
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,320
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

611
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,320
Listen.

612
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,320
Ooh, Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

613
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:46,619
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

614
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,619
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

615
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,519
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

616
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,420
Voilŕ! The best restaurant get first pick.

617
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,519
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

618
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,519
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

619
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:06,119
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

620
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,719
And then he get fired

621
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,619
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

622
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:12,420
Horst has done time.

623
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,519
What for?

624
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,019
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

625
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,019
I defrauded a major corporation.

626
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,619
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

627
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,320
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

628
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,119
I killed a man with this thumb.

629
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

630
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,920
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

631
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,519
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

632
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,619
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

633
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:42,219
So you see.

634
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,719
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

635
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,219
- We?
- Yes. You are one of us now, Yes?

636
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,019
Yes. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

637
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,820
- Thank you, too.
- For, for what?

638
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,519
For taking it.

639
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,519
Huh?

640
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,519
The rat!

641
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:10,719
- Bu... but... but he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

642
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,320
Have you decided this evening?

643
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,420
- Your soup is-is excellent. But... Yeah.
- Uh-huh, But we order it every time.

644
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:24,119
- What else do you have? - You gotta have something else.
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

645
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:25,320
Yeah, I, I know about the foie gras.

646
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,219
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

647
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,420
What does the chef have that's new?

648
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,019
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

649
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,119
Yes. What do I tell them?

650
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,920
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

651
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,320
What are you blathering about?

652
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,519
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

653
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:42,119
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

654
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:43,619
Hmm...

655
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,019
This is simple.

656
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,219
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

657
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,019
something we haven't made
in a while and...

658
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,920
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

659
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,619
They are asking for food from Linguini?

660
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:01,519
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

661
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,119
Were we saying that?

662
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:06,920
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

663
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:11,619
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

664
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,820
Something definitely off menu, hmm?

665
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,820
Oh, and don't forget to stress

666
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,420
- its Linguini-ness.
- Yes, chef.

667
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,619
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

668
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:29,019
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread of Gusteau.

669
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,820
- Colette will help you.
- Yes, chef.

670
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,719
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

671
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,619
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

672
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:38,519
Gusteau himself said so.

673
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,920
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

674
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,619
"Sweetbread of Gusteau.

675
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,219
Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

676
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,320
with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

677
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,920
geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

678
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:54,820
Anchovy licorice sauce."

679
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,219
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

680
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,920
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

681
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,019
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

682
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,320
Veal stomach?

683
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:12,820
Oh!

684
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,019
Okay.

685
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,019
Yeah... Oh!

686
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:24,420
I'll be right back. Where...

687
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:27,719
Yo! Hey... Hey, I got to... Hey!

688
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:32,119
Don't mind me. I'm gonna...
I'm just need to borrow this real quick. Uh...

689
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,420
Let's see, over here...

690
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:35,719
I'll be back.

691
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,019
Thank you.

692
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,320
Excuse me. I'm gonna...

693
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,019
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right... Hey!

694
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:44,820
I'm gonna pick that up. Yeah...

695
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,119
I got some of that spice.

696
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,219
Okay.

697
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,619
What are you doing? You're supposed

698
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,019
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

699
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:53,420
This is, This is the recipe.

700
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,619
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

701
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,219
What else have you...
You are improvising?

702
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,820
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

703
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,119
You're right. I should listen to you!
Ouch!

704
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,420
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

705
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,119
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

706
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:10,219
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

707
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,619
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

708
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,420
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

709
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,820
- The special?
- Come get it!

710
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,519
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

711
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,920
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

712
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,219
Sorry.

713
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,719
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

714
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,820
Yah. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

715
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,519
- Did you taste it?
- Yah, of course, before he changed it.

716
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:50,420
Good. What? How could he change it?

717
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,619
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

718
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,719
Ow!

719
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,820
They love it!

720
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,619
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

721
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,519
I have seven more orders!

722
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:02,219
That's wonderful.

723
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,019
I'd like one of those.

724
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,119
Special order!

725
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:16,920
What is that?

726
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:20,320
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

727
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,119
To Linguini.

728
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:32,820
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, Yah?

729
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Drink now, there's plenty.

730
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,019
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

731
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,119
We really did it tonight.

732
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,320
Dah!

733
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,619
Got your toque!

734
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,019
Oh, seriously now.

735
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,820
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

736
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,619
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

737
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,519
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

738
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,619
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

739
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,420
He's gotten all he needs.

740
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:24,119
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

741
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,119
- Good for you.
- Oh...

742
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:31,219
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

743
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,420
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

744
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,719
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

745
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,820
not to appreciate
this '61 Château Latour.

746
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,119
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.

747
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,920
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

748
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,619
- Remy!
- Emile?

749
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:19,920
- I can't believe it! You're alive!
- I thought I'd...

750
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:21,519
- You made it!
- ...never see you guys again!

751
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:23,619
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

752
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:25,820
And what are you eating?

753
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:30,519
I don't really know.

754
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:33,820
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

755
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,619
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

756
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,219
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

757
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,119
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

758
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:59,420
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

759
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,719
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

760
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,619
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

761
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,320
So, where did you train, Linguini?

762
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,719
Train? All right.

763
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,420
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

764
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:19,820
- It's not.
- I knew it!

765
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,719
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

766
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,420
Monday was my first time.

767
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,320
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

768
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,619
Yes, yes, yes. Have some more wine.

769
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,019
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

770
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:36,119
Do you like animals?

771
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:38,920
What?
Animals? What kind?

772
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,619
Oh, The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

773
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,820
rats.

774
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,420
I brought you something to... Aaah!

775
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,619
No, no, no, no, no!

776
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,519
Spit that out right now!

777
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,519
Oh, i've got to teach you about food.

778
00:54:54,219 --> 00:54:54,820
Close your eyes.

779
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,177
Now... Take a bite of thi...
No! no, no!

780
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:03,677
- Don't just work it down! Eeeh!
- Too late.

781
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:05,177
Here. Hey!

782
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:09,876
- Chew it slowly. Only think about the taste.
- Hm. Mm.

783
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,376
- See?
- Not really.

784
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:17,777
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

785
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:20,876
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

786
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:24,077
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

787
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:29,577
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

788
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:33,277
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

789
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:35,476
Okay.

790
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:39,376
- I think I'm getting a little something there.
- Uh... huh.

791
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:41,577
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

792
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:43,376
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

793
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,376
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

794
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,376
being combined
into infinite combinations.

795
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:50,577
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

796
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:52,077
- I think...
- Uh... huh.

797
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,777
- You lost me again.
- Huh, Yeah.

798
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:57,277
But that was interesting.

799
00:55:57,376 --> 00:56:00,177
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

800
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,677
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

801
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:04,077
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

802
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:05,677
- Yeah! But... Ah... hm...
- What?

803
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:08,777
Thing is, I kind of have to...

804
00:56:09,277 --> 00:56:11,277
What do you "have to"
more than family?

805
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:12,677
What's more important here?

806
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:14,376
Well, I...

807
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,876
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

808
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:19,777
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

809
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,777
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

810
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:23,376
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

811
00:56:23,476 --> 00:56:25,077
Nopety nopety no.

812
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,876
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

813
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:31,277
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

814
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:33,777
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

815
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:37,976
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

816
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,677
If you're going to name a food,

817
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:42,677
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

818
00:56:42,876 --> 00:56:48,077
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

819
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:52,376
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

820
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:59,777
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

821
00:57:00,077 --> 00:57:04,577
My son has returned!

822
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:34,077
...And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

823
00:57:34,177 --> 00:57:38,077
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

824
00:57:38,277 --> 00:57:42,677
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

825
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:46,277
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

826
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,476
Yeah, well, uh, about that...

827
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,376
You look thin. Why is that?

828
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:54,976
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

829
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,677
Yeah...

830
00:57:57,677 --> 00:58:00,677
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

831
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,876
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

832
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:06,577
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

833
00:58:06,677 --> 00:58:10,577
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

834
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:14,177
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

835
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:17,077
- Visit? Well...
- I will. I promise. Often.

836
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:22,177
- ...You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

837
00:58:22,277 --> 00:58:24,876
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

838
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:27,177
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

839
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:29,577
We're not birds. We're rats.

840
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:32,577
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

841
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:35,677
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

842
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:36,876
Maybe that's a good thing.

843
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:39,376
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

844
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:41,677
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

845
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:44,277
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

846
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:46,476
I want to add something to this world.

847
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:49,677
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

848
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,476
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

849
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:56,277
I've been able to
observe them

850
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:59,277
at a close-ish sort of range.

851
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:01,677
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

852
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:05,376
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

853
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,876
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

854
00:59:11,476 --> 00:59:13,876
You know, I'm going to stay here.

855
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:18,177
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

856
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:21,376
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

857
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:23,476
- Is that a problem?
- Uh...

858
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:27,177
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

859
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:35,976
We're here.

860
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,577
Take a good long look, Remy.

861
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:51,376
Now, this is what happens

862
00:59:51,476 --> 00:59:55,077
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

863
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:59,476
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

864
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:02,876
We must live carefully.

865
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:07,077
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

866
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:11,177
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

867
01:00:15,976 --> 01:00:18,376
- No.
- What?

868
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:25,376
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

869
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:28,577
Can only be more of this?

870
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:33,976
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

871
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:39,376
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

872
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:42,976
And it starts when we decide.

873
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:47,876
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

874
01:01:11,777 --> 01:01:13,077
Hey! Yeah.

875
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,077
Whoa!

876
01:02:11,177 --> 01:02:12,376
Stop it.

877
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:47,976
Good morning.

878
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:51,677
Good morning.

879
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:57,177
So, the chef,
he uh, invited you in for a drink?

880
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,876
That's big.

881
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:01,777
That's big. What did he say?

882
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:07,277
What?

883
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:09,876
What, you can't tell me?

884
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:11,777
Oh!

885
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:16,577
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

886
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:18,077
Oh, I see how it is.

887
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:20,777
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

888
01:03:20,976 --> 01:03:23,677
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

889
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:25,277
Wake up. Wake up.

890
01:03:26,577 --> 01:03:29,376
I thought you were different.

891
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:33,077
I thought you thought I was different.

892
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:34,876
I thought...

893
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:40,077
I didn't have to help you!

894
01:03:40,177 --> 01:03:43,577
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

895
01:03:43,677 --> 01:03:44,777
But...

896
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:50,277
I wanted you to succeed. I... I liked you.

897
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:53,577
My mistake.

898
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:57,577
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

899
01:03:57,777 --> 01:04:00,677
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

900
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:04,777
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

901
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:08,177
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

902
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,077
At least not without your help.

903
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:13,577
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

904
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:17,777
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

905
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,976
When I added that extra ingredient

906
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:22,976
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

907
01:04:23,077 --> 01:04:25,277
that wasn't me either.

908
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:28,277
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

909
01:04:28,376 --> 01:04:30,177
I, I, I would've followed the recipe.

910
01:04:30,277 --> 01:04:31,677
I would've followed your advice.

911
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:33,577
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

912
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:37,876
- Because I love you...r advice.
- But...

913
01:04:37,976 --> 01:04:39,577
But I...

914
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,277
Don't do it.

915
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:44,677
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

916
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:49,976
- I have a Ra...
- What? You...

917
01:04:50,077 --> 01:04:54,277
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

918
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:59,677
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny uh, little...

919
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:00,976
Little...

920
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:04,277
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

921
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:06,376
A tiny chef?

922
01:05:06,476 --> 01:05:08,976
Yes. Yes. He's um...

923
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:13,976
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

924
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:19,376
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

925
01:05:20,577 --> 01:05:24,476
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

926
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:29,376
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

927
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,677
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

928
01:05:31,876 --> 01:05:33,876
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

929
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:36,677
Don't laugh! I'm-I'm gonna show you!

930
01:05:40,277 --> 01:05:41,376
No! No!

931
01:05:57,677 --> 01:05:58,577
Ahh!

932
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:29,177
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

933
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,177
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

934
01:06:32,277 --> 01:06:35,376
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

935
01:06:35,476 --> 01:06:37,976
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

936
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,976
What? What? Spit it out.

937
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:43,476
It's come back. It's popular.

938
01:06:47,777 --> 01:06:51,376
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

939
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:52,577
My last review condemned it

940
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,277
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:58,577
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

942
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:02,376
right alongside
another equally famous chef,

943
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,277
Mr. Boyardee."

944
01:07:04,376 --> 01:07:05,376
Touché.

945
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:08,876
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

946
01:07:09,077 --> 01:07:11,976
- The last word.
- Yes.

947
01:07:12,077 --> 01:07:14,376
Then tell me, Ambrister,

948
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:19,277
how could it be popular?

949
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:24,777
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

950
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:27,976
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

951
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,376
He is Gusteau's son.

952
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:33,376
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

953
01:07:33,476 --> 01:07:34,777
The boy knows!

954
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:37,876
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

955
01:07:37,976 --> 01:07:42,376
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

956
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,976
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

957
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:47,077
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

958
01:07:47,177 --> 01:07:48,876
Yes. He's consorting with it.

959
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:51,476
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

960
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:54,177
- The rat.
- Exactly!

961
01:07:55,476 --> 01:07:58,077
Is the rat important?

962
01:07:58,277 --> 01:08:01,476
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

963
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,876
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

964
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:06,677
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

965
01:08:06,777 --> 01:08:09,277
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

966
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,177
Ooh! Ooh...

967
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:13,376
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

968
01:08:13,476 --> 01:08:16,676
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

969
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:17,877
But, oh, no!

970
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:22,277
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

971
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:30,976
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

972
01:08:38,077 --> 01:08:39,077
Huh?

973
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,777
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

974
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,277
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

975
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,777
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

976
01:08:57,877 --> 01:08:59,577
What are you so worried about?

977
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:00,877
Isn't it good to have the press?

978
01:09:00,976 --> 01:09:03,577
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

979
01:09:03,676 --> 01:09:06,077
Not if they're over his face!

980
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:10,277
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

981
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:15,377
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

982
01:09:15,476 --> 01:09:17,476
The deadline passes in three days.

983
01:09:17,577 --> 01:09:20,476
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

984
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,676
and no one will ever know.

985
01:09:23,277 --> 01:09:25,676
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

986
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:28,277
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

987
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:32,877
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

988
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:39,777
- No, no, no.
- What?

989
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:42,176
Try this. It's better.

990
01:09:56,277 --> 01:09:58,377
Whoa! Well, because you...

991
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:00,476
Whoa!

992
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:23,676
Rat!

993
01:10:30,176 --> 01:10:32,377
Disgusting little creatures.

994
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:45,277
I was reminded
how fragile it all was.

995
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:48,277
How the world really saw me.

996
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:53,077
And it just kept getting better.

997
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:53,777
Remy!

998
01:10:53,777 --> 01:10:54,676
Remy!

999
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,077
Psst! Psst!

1000
01:10:58,277 --> 01:11:00,676
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

1001
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:04,377
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

1002
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:08,377
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

1003
01:11:08,476 --> 01:11:11,377
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

1004
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,277
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

1005
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:14,476
I didn't think you meant them.

1006
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:16,676
Look, I'm sorry.

1007
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:19,176
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

1008
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:23,877
- Hey, uh, Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

1009
01:11:23,976 --> 01:11:25,277
Wait here.

1010
01:11:31,176 --> 01:11:32,377
It's locked?

1011
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:34,877
Hmm...

1012
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:41,277
Remy, what are you doing in here?

1013
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:44,176
Okay, okay. Emile shows up with...

1014
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:48,176
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

1015
01:11:48,377 --> 01:11:50,476
Yeah, it's a disaster.

1016
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:54,176
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

1017
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:58,176
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's, ohh...

1018
01:11:58,577 --> 01:12:02,377
It's complicated. It's-It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

1019
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:05,176
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

1020
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:07,277
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

1021
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:08,476
- Or microwave burritos?
- Yeah...

1022
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,676
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

1023
01:12:10,777 --> 01:12:12,476
About as French as a corn dog!

1024
01:12:12,777 --> 01:12:13,777
- Coming soon!
- Huh...

1025
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:15,777
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

1026
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:17,476
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

1027
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:19,277
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

1028
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,777
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

1029
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:26,877
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

1030
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:30,277
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and uh...

1031
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:31,377
Here it is.

1032
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:34,077
Hey. Your will!

1033
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:38,877
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

1034
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:42,877
Linguini?

1035
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:46,476
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

1036
01:12:46,577 --> 01:12:48,377
This used to be my office.

1037
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:13,176
He's your son?

1038
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:16,077
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

1039
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:20,176
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

1040
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:21,176
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1041
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:24,077
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1042
01:13:25,476 --> 01:13:27,077
No! No! The rat!

1043
01:13:30,476 --> 01:13:33,077
Nooo....

1044
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:35,976
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents! Aaah!

1045
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,476
- It's getting away!
- Hey, Mr. Chef!

1046
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:03,476
Whoa... oh... ow!

1047
01:14:37,377 --> 01:14:38,377
Yaah!

1048
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:40,077
Ha! Yaah.

1049
01:15:12,777 --> 01:15:14,377
You!

1050
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:19,176
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1051
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:24,377
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1052
01:15:26,976 --> 01:15:28,176
Cheers, Yah.

1053
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:21,476
Yaah!

1054
01:16:31,377 --> 01:16:32,476
Oh!

1055
01:16:35,476 --> 01:16:37,777
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

1056
01:16:38,976 --> 01:16:41,976
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1057
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:43,577
What is the secret to your genius?

1058
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:47,277
Secret? Y-you, you want the truth?

1059
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:53,377
I am uh, Gus-gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1060
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:55,877
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

1061
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:56,877
No.

1062
01:16:56,976 --> 01:16:59,777
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1063
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:01,377
How did you find out?

1064
01:17:01,476 --> 01:17:04,777
Well, some part of me just knew.

1065
01:17:05,277 --> 01:17:06,577
The Gusteau part?

1066
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:08,077
Ow!

1067
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:12,676
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1068
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:15,476
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1069
01:17:17,077 --> 01:17:19,176
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1070
01:17:22,676 --> 01:17:23,976
Health Inspector.

1071
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:26,676
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1072
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:27,976
It's taken over my res...

1073
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,476
Uh... G-gusteau's restaurant.

1074
01:17:30,577 --> 01:17:31,676
Gusteau's, eh?

1075
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:35,976
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1076
01:17:36,077 --> 01:17:38,176
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!

1077
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:41,077
Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

1078
01:17:41,176 --> 01:17:43,277
But, but, but the rat!
You must...

1079
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:46,877
It stole my documents.

1080
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:49,676
It's past opening time.

1081
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:52,176
Ah. He should have
finished an hour ago.

1082
01:17:54,077 --> 01:17:56,377
Hello, darling.
Join us.

1083
01:17:56,476 --> 01:17:58,577
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1084
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:01,077
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1085
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,777
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1086
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,077
- It's him.
- Ego?

1087
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:10,176
Anton Ego!

1088
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:11,676
Is that Ego?

1089
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:13,877
I can't believe it.

1090
01:18:13,976 --> 01:18:17,277
- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Oh, Hello.

1091
01:18:17,377 --> 01:18:21,877
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1092
01:18:21,976 --> 01:18:25,676
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1093
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:27,976
as you are new to this game.

1094
01:18:27,976 --> 01:18:29,277
Uh...

1095
01:18:29,277 --> 01:18:30,476
- Game?
- Yes.

1096
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:33,676
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1097
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:38,877
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1098
01:18:39,077 --> 01:18:41,176
You're Anton Ego.

1099
01:18:42,777 --> 01:18:45,676
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1100
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:50,277
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1101
01:18:51,077 --> 01:18:52,277
What did he said?!

1102
01:18:53,877 --> 01:18:57,877
I don't like food. I love it.

1103
01:18:58,277 --> 01:19:02,577
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1104
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:07,877
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1105
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:11,077
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1106
01:19:18,377 --> 01:19:21,877
- Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.
- Ah...

1107
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:25,077
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and-and we're French."

1108
01:19:26,976 --> 01:19:28,476
Don't give me that look.

1109
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:30,777
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1110
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:35,377
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1111
01:19:35,476 --> 01:19:36,676
And that's another thing.

1112
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,676
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1113
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,377
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know. Aww!

1114
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:43,976
All right, that's it!

1115
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:49,877
You take a break, Little Chef.

1116
01:19:49,976 --> 01:19:51,176
I'm not your puppet,

1117
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:54,377
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1118
01:19:54,476 --> 01:19:56,277
The rat is the cook!

1119
01:19:56,377 --> 01:19:57,077
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1120
01:19:57,077 --> 01:19:59,277
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1121
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,377
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1122
01:20:05,476 --> 01:20:06,877
You stupid...

1123
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:12,577
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1124
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:15,976
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1125
01:20:17,476 --> 01:20:18,976
I'm sorry, Remy.

1126
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,077
I know there are too many guys.

1127
01:20:20,176 --> 01:20:21,176
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1128
01:20:21,277 --> 01:20:23,077
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1129
01:20:23,176 --> 01:20:25,277
- You guys hungry?
- Wha... Are you kidding?

1130
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:28,277
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1131
01:20:28,476 --> 01:20:29,577
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1132
01:20:29,676 --> 01:20:32,077
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1133
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:35,176
Little Chef?

1134
01:20:44,476 --> 01:20:49,476
Wow! This is great, Son.
An inside job huh. I see the appeal.

1135
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:10,176
Oof!

1136
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:27,777
Little Chef?

1137
01:21:28,577 --> 01:21:29,777
Little Chef?

1138
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:32,176
O-hey, hey, Little Chef.

1139
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:35,577
I, I thought you went back
to the-the apartment.

1140
01:21:35,777 --> 01:21:39,877
Then when you weren't there,
I, I don't know... I...

1141
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:44,277
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1142
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:47,176
Look, I don't want to fight.

1143
01:21:47,377 --> 01:21:50,077
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1144
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:53,577
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1145
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:54,976
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1146
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,976
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1147
01:21:58,176 --> 01:21:59,777
people will be disappointed.

1148
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:01,777
It's weird.

1149
01:22:01,877 --> 01:22:04,777
You know, I-I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1150
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:07,676
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1151
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:10,577
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1152
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,877
is because of you.

1153
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,176
I haven't been fair to you.

1154
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:19,777
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1155
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:21,676
You've been a good friend.

1156
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:24,976
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever a... ah...

1157
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,176
What is this?

1158
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,277
What's going on?

1159
01:22:32,777 --> 01:22:33,777
What...

1160
01:22:33,877 --> 01:22:34,777
Hey...

1161
01:22:35,377 --> 01:22:36,676
You're... you...

1162
01:22:36,777 --> 01:22:39,877
You're stealing food? Whoa... How could you?

1163
01:22:39,976 --> 01:22:43,077
I, I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1164
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:45,577
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1165
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:47,077
And don't come back

1166
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:50,577
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1167
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:01,976
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1168
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,976
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1169
01:23:07,377 --> 01:23:11,176
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1170
01:23:11,676 --> 01:23:13,077
Steal all you want.

1171
01:23:13,176 --> 01:23:16,077
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1172
01:23:30,676 --> 01:23:33,176
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1173
01:23:33,277 --> 01:23:38,077
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1174
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:44,976
Come in!

1175
01:23:45,176 --> 01:23:48,377
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1176
01:23:48,577 --> 01:23:52,377
- Like-like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1177
01:23:55,777 --> 01:23:57,176
Attention.

1178
01:23:57,377 --> 01:24:00,077
Attention, everyone.

1179
01:24:00,277 --> 01:24:02,476
Tonight is a big night.

1180
01:24:02,676 --> 01:24:06,577
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1181
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:10,777
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The-the-the critic.

1182
01:24:11,476 --> 01:24:14,377
And he's going to order something.

1183
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,077
Something from our menu.

1184
01:24:17,777 --> 01:24:21,877
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1185
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:23,777
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

1186
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:27,577
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1187
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:28,877
I'm hungry!

1188
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,676
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1189
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:34,777
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1190
01:24:35,176 --> 01:24:37,277
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1191
01:24:38,877 --> 01:24:42,777
- Oh, no! No, no, no! What do we do?
I-I'll go get Dad.

1192
01:24:45,277 --> 01:24:51,577
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1193
01:24:51,976 --> 01:24:55,176
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1194
01:24:55,377 --> 01:24:57,777
Sure it probably killed Gust... Dad.

1195
01:24:57,976 --> 01:25:01,777
- Ooh! This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1196
01:25:01,877 --> 01:25:04,676
- Ego is here. - What?
- Ego? He is here?

1197
01:25:06,676 --> 01:25:10,777
- Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook! - Yeah. - Yes!

1198
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:12,777
Yeah! Let's...

1199
01:25:13,176 --> 01:25:14,377
Okay.

1200
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:18,777
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1201
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,976
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1202
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:26,877
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1203
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:33,777
bye, rat!

1204
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:43,676
Eeh, Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1205
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,377
Yes, I think I do.

1206
01:25:45,877 --> 01:25:49,976
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1207
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:52,176
you know what I'm craving?

1208
01:25:53,176 --> 01:25:56,476
A little perspective.

1209
01:25:56,676 --> 01:26:01,777
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1210
01:26:01,877 --> 01:26:04,676
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1211
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:09,676
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1212
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:10,976
I am uh...

1213
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:14,877
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1214
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:18,277
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1215
01:26:18,377 --> 01:26:19,976
I'll make you a deal.

1216
01:26:20,077 --> 01:26:24,176
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1217
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:28,277
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1218
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:30,867
I-I'm afraid I... Um... Um...

1219
01:26:31,877 --> 01:26:34,277
Your dinner selection?

1220
01:26:34,976 --> 01:26:39,777
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1221
01:26:39,877 --> 01:26:43,277
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1222
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,976
I will have whatever he is having.

1223
01:26:56,777 --> 01:27:00,277
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1224
01:27:00,476 --> 01:27:03,476
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1225
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:06,577
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1226
01:27:06,777 --> 01:27:10,577
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1227
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,277
You are free.

1228
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:16,877
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1229
01:27:16,976 --> 01:27:18,277
As you are.

1230
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:22,976
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1231
01:27:23,077 --> 01:27:25,476
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1232
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:28,277
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1233
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:30,377
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1234
01:27:30,476 --> 01:27:33,476
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1235
01:27:33,577 --> 01:27:35,577
Why do I need to pretend?

1236
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:39,277
Ah. But you don't, Remy.

1237
01:27:40,077 --> 01:27:41,676
You never did.

1238
01:27:50,676 --> 01:27:52,676
No. My other left!

1239
01:27:52,877 --> 01:27:54,676
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1240
01:27:54,877 --> 01:27:57,176
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1241
01:27:57,476 --> 01:27:58,476
Dad!

1242
01:27:59,077 --> 01:28:01,676
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1243
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:07,277
I love you guys!

1244
01:28:09,277 --> 01:28:10,377
Where are you going?

1245
01:28:10,476 --> 01:28:12,976
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1246
01:28:13,077 --> 01:28:16,676
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1247
01:28:22,976 --> 01:28:24,176
- Ooh!
- Aw!

1248
01:28:24,377 --> 01:28:26,176
It's your recipe.

1249
01:28:26,277 --> 01:28:28,377
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1250
01:28:28,476 --> 01:28:31,377
- I didn't write it down. It just came to me.
- Aw!

1251
01:28:31,476 --> 01:28:34,577
Then make it come to you again, Yah?
Because we can't serve this!

1252
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:35,676
Where's my order?

1253
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,176
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1254
01:28:38,277 --> 01:28:39,277
This is what they're ordering.

1255
01:28:39,377 --> 01:28:41,777
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1256
01:28:41,877 --> 01:28:43,577
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1257
01:28:43,676 --> 01:28:46,676
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1258
01:28:46,777 --> 01:28:48,877
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1259
01:28:48,976 --> 01:28:50,377
I don't know what I did.

1260
01:28:50,476 --> 01:28:52,176
We need to tell
the customers something.

1261
01:28:52,277 --> 01:28:54,077
Then tell them... Tell them...

1262
01:28:54,077 --> 01:28:56,277
Aaaaaah....

1263
01:28:58,277 --> 01:28:59,476
Huh?

1264
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:02,676
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1265
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,777
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1266
01:29:04,877 --> 01:29:08,877
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right n...

1267
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,277
Rats!

1268
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:13,577
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1269
01:29:14,077 --> 01:29:15,676
Don't touch him!

1270
01:29:17,976 --> 01:29:20,377
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1271
01:29:21,676 --> 01:29:23,976
I know this sounds insane, but...

1272
01:29:24,077 --> 01:29:26,676
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1273
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:28,577
But that doesn't mean it's not

1274
01:29:28,676 --> 01:29:30,877
th-the-the truth.

1275
01:29:31,577 --> 01:29:35,777
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1276
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:40,476
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1277
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:45,676
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1278
01:29:45,976 --> 01:29:47,976
He's been controlling my actions.

1279
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:53,577
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1280
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:56,877
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1281
01:29:57,176 --> 01:29:59,877
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1282
01:30:00,176 --> 01:30:01,777
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1283
01:30:01,877 --> 01:30:04,877
But, hey, you-you believed I could cook,
right?

1284
01:30:06,577 --> 01:30:10,777
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1285
01:30:11,277 --> 01:30:13,676
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1286
01:30:13,777 --> 01:30:19,277
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1287
01:30:19,976 --> 01:30:22,377
What do you say? You with me?

1288
01:31:08,377 --> 01:31:09,377
Huh...

1289
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:11,377
Dad.

1290
01:32:15,476 --> 01:32:18,377
Dad, I... I don't know what to say.

1291
01:32:18,577 --> 01:32:22,676
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1292
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:26,877
I, I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1293
01:32:27,077 --> 01:32:29,877
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1294
01:32:29,976 --> 01:32:33,777
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1295
01:32:34,476 --> 01:32:36,877
This really means that much to you?

1296
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,877
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1297
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:51,077
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1298
01:32:59,077 --> 01:33:02,676
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1299
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,077
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1300
01:33:28,176 --> 01:33:29,976
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1301
01:33:29,976 --> 01:33:31,676
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1302
01:33:31,877 --> 01:33:37,277
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1303
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:40,077
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1304
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:51,777
We need someone to wait tables.

1305
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:10,077
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1306
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,476
Please, take all of the time you need.

1307
01:34:15,577 --> 01:34:18,176
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1308
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:24,877
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1309
01:34:24,976 --> 01:34:27,277
- Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move. - Uuh... Uuh! Yeah...

1310
01:34:27,377 --> 01:34:30,877
- Easy with that sole meuničre.
Less salt. More butter. - Yeah...

1311
01:34:31,176 --> 01:34:33,077
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1312
01:34:33,176 --> 01:34:36,777
Whoa, whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1313
01:34:36,976 --> 01:34:39,676
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composite.

1314
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:42,877
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1315
01:34:42,976 --> 01:34:47,176
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1316
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,676
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1317
01:34:49,877 --> 01:34:52,777
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1318
01:34:52,877 --> 01:34:53,976
Sorry.

1319
01:34:57,676 --> 01:34:59,777
Colette, wait! Colette.

1320
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:04,277
- You came back. Colette, I...
- Don't say a word.

1321
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:05,877
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1322
01:35:06,077 --> 01:35:08,476
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1323
01:35:11,577 --> 01:35:14,077
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1324
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:17,176
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1325
01:35:35,676 --> 01:35:37,577
What? I am making ratatouille.

1326
01:35:38,777 --> 01:35:41,176
Well, how would you prepare it?

1327
01:36:13,277 --> 01:36:16,377
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1328
01:37:02,476 --> 01:37:03,777
Mmm.

1329
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:06,577
Mm... mmm...

1330
01:37:07,277 --> 01:37:09,077
No, it can't be.

1331
01:37:09,676 --> 01:37:13,277
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1332
01:37:20,277 --> 01:37:21,976
I can't remember the last time

1333
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:25,377
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1334
01:37:26,277 --> 01:37:29,077
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1335
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,277
of having my waiter be the chef.

1336
01:37:31,476 --> 01:37:34,476
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1337
01:37:35,476 --> 01:37:37,976
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1338
01:37:38,077 --> 01:37:38,777
Uhh...

1339
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:40,577
Excuse me a minute.

1340
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:52,577
You must be the chef...

1341
01:37:52,676 --> 01:37:54,777
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1342
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:56,976
until all the other customer have gone.

1343
01:37:58,976 --> 01:38:00,176
So be it.

1344
01:38:21,877 --> 01:38:24,377
At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.

1345
01:38:24,577 --> 01:38:30,577
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.

1346
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:40,176
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.

1347
01:38:40,777 --> 01:38:45,077
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...

1348
01:38:45,176 --> 01:38:46,877
Thank you for the meal.

1349
01:38:46,976 --> 01:38:49,877
... and leaves without another word.

1350
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:56,077
The following day his review appears.

1351
01:38:58,577 --> 01:39:02,676
In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1352
01:39:02,877 --> 01:39:07,176
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1353
01:39:07,277 --> 01:39:11,277
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1354
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:16,877
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1355
01:39:17,476 --> 01:39:23,976
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1356
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:28,077
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1357
01:39:28,176 --> 01:39:31,476
than our criticism designating it so.

1358
01:39:31,877 --> 01:39:35,976
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1359
01:39:36,077 --> 01:39:40,377
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1360
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:45,077
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1361
01:39:45,277 --> 01:39:47,777
The new needs friends.

1362
01:39:48,077 --> 01:39:51,577
Last night,
I experienced something new,

1363
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:56,777
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1364
01:39:56,976 --> 01:39:59,577
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1365
01:39:59,676 --> 01:40:03,176
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1366
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:05,976
is a gross understatement.

1367
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:09,577
They have rocked me to my core.

1368
01:40:10,377 --> 01:40:13,777
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain

1369
01:40:13,877 --> 01:40:18,877
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1370
01:40:19,176 --> 01:40:25,377
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.

1371
01:40:25,676 --> 01:40:29,577
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1372
01:40:29,777 --> 01:40:34,077
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1373
01:40:34,676 --> 01:40:37,976
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1374
01:40:38,077 --> 01:40:41,877
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1375
01:40:41,976 --> 01:40:44,877
who is, in this critic's opinion,

1376
01:40:44,976 --> 01:40:49,176
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1377
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,277
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1378
01:40:51,277 --> 01:40:54,676
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1379
01:40:55,077 --> 01:40:56,577
It was a great night.

1380
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,476
The happiest of my life.

1381
01:40:58,577 --> 01:41:03,077
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.

1382
01:41:03,176 --> 01:41:06,377
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,

1383
01:41:06,476 --> 01:41:08,877
and of course they ratted us out.

1384
01:41:09,277 --> 01:41:10,877
The food didn't matter.

1385
01:41:10,976 --> 01:41:13,377
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,

1386
01:41:13,476 --> 01:41:15,476
oh, man, the restaurant was closed

1387
01:41:15,577 --> 01:41:18,377
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1388
01:41:18,476 --> 01:41:20,377
But don't feel too bad for him.

1389
01:41:20,476 --> 01:41:23,976
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1390
01:41:24,277 --> 01:41:26,877
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know? - Uh, huh.

1391
01:41:35,077 --> 01:41:37,176
Yah. Got to go. Dinner rush.

1392
01:41:44,777 --> 01:41:46,476
You know how he likes it.

1393
01:41:51,777 --> 01:41:53,377
Thanks, Little Chef.

1394
01:42:00,077 --> 01:42:02,877
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1395
01:42:02,976 --> 01:42:06,176
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

1396
01:42:07,277 --> 01:42:09,077
Surprise me.

1397
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:17,976
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1398
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:25,077
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1399
01:42:26,976 --> 01:42:30,077
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!

1400
01:42:51,077 --> 02:42:30,076
