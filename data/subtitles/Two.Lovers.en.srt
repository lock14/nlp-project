1
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,974
<i>Leonard...</i>

2
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:28,312
<i>I love you,</i>

3
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:31,007
<i>but I have
to go.</i>

4
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,781
<i>I have to.</i>

5
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,069
Oh!

6
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,838
- Help!
- Hey! Hey, come here, man.

7
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,841
You all right, man?

8
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,776
- Should we call an ambulance?
- I don't know.

9
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:01,745
Just get-- get him down.
Watch out, watch out!

10
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:04,314
- He swallowed a lot of water.
- Sit him up!

11
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,149
- Sit him up.
- Sit him up.

12
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,850
- Go!
- Get him on his back.

13
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll try C.P.R.

14
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,289
Stop!

15
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,558
Are you all right?
You all right?

16
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,661
What happened there?

17
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,764
I fell in the water.

18
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:22,931
No, he didn't!
I saw him.

19
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:24,735
<i>- He jumped.
- Breathe, breathe.</i>

20
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,270
What are you talking about?
I fell in the water.

21
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,271
<i>- He just jumped in.
- Come on, I gotta go!</i>

22
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:29,435
Just take it easy, man.
Where you going?

23
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:29,973
Where you going?

24
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:32,115
You gotta wait
for the cops, man.

25
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:32,241
Hey!

26
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,743
Hey, buddy, you even gonna thank
the guy who just saved your life?

27
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:34,977
Huh?

28
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:37,581
This guy right here--
he just saved your life.

29
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,917
Oh.
Thank you.

30
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,586
<i>Jesus.</i>

31
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:45,722
<i>Hey, ain't that the guy
that works over at the, uh,</i>

32
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,890
<i>the dry-cleaner
on Neptune Avenue?</i>

33
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,293
<i>Maybe. But he doesn't look
too dry to me now.</i>

34
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:53,429
<i>Douchebag.</i>

35
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,399
<i>From New York 1 News,</i>

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,968
<i>This is
"New York Tonight."</i>

37
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:00,621
Hello?

38
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,807
<i>I was beginning to think
you weren't going to make it.</i>

39
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:07,961
<i>We're having guests
for dinner tonight.</i>

40
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,265
What-- what happened?

41
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,717
Huh?

42
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:16,552
You're all wet.

43
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,572
I fell
into the bay.

44
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,807
It's cold-- Mom, come
on, stop. I'm fine.

45
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,875
- You fell into the bay?
- It's not gonna happen again.

46
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,011
<i>- Don't worry.
- Leonard.</i>

47
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,363
It was an accident.
Can I change, please?

48
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:28,731
Reuben!

49
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,367
Mom, I'm fine!
I'm fine.

50
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,737
What is the matter?

51
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:37,374
I think he
tried again.

52
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,425
He said he fell
in the bay.

53
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,882
Leonard?

54
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:49,685
<i>I think he forgot
his medication this morning.</i>

55
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,737
<i>Leonard?</i>

56
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,240
<i>Listen-- the man who wants
to buy our business</i>

57
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:57,394
<i>is coming over tonight
with his family.</i>

58
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:58,762
<i>Let's cancel that.</i>

59
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,245
<i>No, they're almost here.</i>

60
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:03,516
<i>Look, if he still has
this bipolar problem,</i>

61
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,569
<i>he just has to
take his pills.</i>

62
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:09,221
<i>It would be nice if
you joined us, okay?</i>

63
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,040
<i>'Cause we want you
to join us.</i>

64
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,841
Okay.

65
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,091
Stupid stupid.

66
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,427
Hi, how are you?
Oh, enjoy.

67
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:33,846
Thank you!

68
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,949
- Hi.
- Hello.

69
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,485
I hope we're not late.
The directions were perfect.

70
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,387
- It smells good.
- How you feeling?

71
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:41,670
Good,
thank you.

72
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,124
Good. You remember
my wife Carol.

73
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,792
Hi, nice to
see you again.

74
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:48,545
<i>- Thank you so much.
- And these are my kids--</i>

75
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:50,596
<i>--David, my son.</i>

76
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:52,882
<i>David.
My beautiful daughter Sandra.</i>

77
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:56,119
<i>Oh thanks, Dad.
Pleased to meet you.</i>

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,653
I have to go
to the bathroom.

79
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:59,788
Down at the end
of the hallway.

80
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,591
Hey hey, David,
what you got?

81
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:04,661
Ohh!

82
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,362
David,
say thank you.

83
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,665
All right. Come inside.
Let me take your coats.

84
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,666
Yeah, take
the coats.

85
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,920
- This is a beautiful place.
- Yeah, you like it?

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,055
It's so nostalgic--
it's like the place I grew up in.

87
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,505
<i>Eat what you'd like. Okay.</i>

88
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:19,125
- They're not baked.
- They taste like baked.

89
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:20,644
Okay.

90
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:24,096
My wife-- my princess--
is in the kitchen getting dinner ready.

91
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,865
She'll be right out.
Anyway, help yourself.

92
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,235
It's homemade hummus.
I did it.

93
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,271
<i>- Oh!
- Yeah.</i>

94
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,939
<i>Mmm, terrific! Terrific!</i>

95
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,324
<i>- Ooh!
- This is my son Leonard.</i>

96
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,194
- How you doing?
- Leonard? Michael Cohen.

97
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,411
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,863
My wife Carol,
my daughter Sandra.

99
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:43,466
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

100
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,903
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,156
<i>...Not from the Catskills.</i>

102
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,774
<i>The Catskills that we
were talking about</i>

103
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,776
<i>Is like
the slums of the Catskills.</i>

104
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:56,379
- Which part? Which part?
- South Fallsburg, Loch Sheldrake.

105
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,665
- Which is more west?
- Kiamesha. Kiamesha.

106
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:01,334
<i>Is it more west than--
- We met at the Catskills.</i>

107
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,519
<i>Just in time for the flies.</i>

108
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,838
<i>You were very--
- And you were the prettiest one.</i>

109
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,990
<i>I paid him to say that.</i>

110
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,093
<i>35 years ago in
the Catskills.</i>

111
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,211
<i>Please don't make me older.</i>

112
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,247
- Hey, you like magic?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:17,100
You ever heard of
the melting spoon?

114
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,619
No.

115
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
It's really cool.

116
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,322
<i>Now they put so many
things in your path.</i>

117
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,391
<i>I mean, all the inspections
and all of the licensing</i>

118
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:29,461
<i>and all the-- the different
technology-- the machines.</i>

119
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:31,197
<i>It's amazing you can
run a business.</i>

120
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,332
You know, my son's been
working with me a little

121
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,185
since he's been back.

122
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:37,754
<i>You know?
I don't know how much he likes it, but...</i>

123
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,893
<i>What about it, Lenny?
Do you like it?</i>

124
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,595
<i>Do you like
the dry-cleaning business?</i>

125
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:48,997
It's all right, you know?
It's good to help out the family.

126
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,417
<i>He's a good photographer--
I'll tell you that.</i>

127
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,286
<i>Really?
- Yes. Yes yes.</i>

128
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,355
Yeah, I gave him
an old camera

129
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,257
and now all he does--
he takes pictures all over the place.

130
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,608
<i>Really?</i>

131
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,177
<i>Beautiful black-and-white photos.</i>

132
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:02,528
<i>Black and white.
- Thanks, Mom.</i>

133
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,480
Yes, they are
beautiful photos.

134
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,632
<i>Carol?
- Yes?</i>

135
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,985
- Do you know what I'm thinking right--
- I know what you're thinking.

136
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,637
<i>Listen, I have a little
proposition.</i>

137
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,240
<i>- Mmm, here we go.
- No no.</i>

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,591
We have-- we have
a bar mitzvah.

139
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,826
David's bar mitzvah
is coming up next week.

140
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,862
Oh, and of course
you're all invited.

141
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:21,297
- You're invited.
- Oh, thank you.

142
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,466
Oh, yeah.
- But we have a photographer,

143
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,269
and he's taking the color shots and
he's taking the slides and the set-ups,

144
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,821
but my wife,
the artistic one,

145
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,206
she wants
the black and white.

146
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,174
Yes, we do.
- Lenny?

147
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,894
<i>Do you think you'd be interested
in doing something like that?</i>

148
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,629
Oh, I don't know
about that.

149
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,481
<i>- I mean, I--
- Why not?</i>

150
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,283
I don't-- I don't really
do impromptu things.

151
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:43,302
- I mean--
- Oh, try. You'll see what happens.

152
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,471
<i>I'd love to see his stuff--</i>

153
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,107
just check it out a little bit.
Do you think I could?

154
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,908
Okay.

155
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,927
I'll show you some.

156
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,663
Leonard, why don't you show
Sandra your pictures?

157
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,134
I don't know if--
you want to see that now?

158
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,750
Yeah, I'd love
to see them.

159
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,086
'Kay.
Come on.

160
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:04,139
<i>I tell him all the time
but he gets angry at me.</i>

161
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,726
- Report back.
- I'll call you for dessert.

162
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,077
Eh?

163
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,134
I wasn't expecting
visitors.

164
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,504
Yeah, you've got
a lot of stuff in here.

165
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,005
Yeah.

166
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,375
I wasn't planning on being
home for so long, so...

167
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,977
I gotta organize this place.
I don't know what the fuck.

168
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,013
Oh, when--
when did you get back?

169
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,014
Uh, about
four months ago.

170
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,250
Mmm.

171
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,701
What are we doing?
Oh, yeah-- pictures.

172
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,604
You can sit down
if you want.

173
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,105
Okay.

174
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,912
- Let's see.
- You have a lot of DVDs.

175
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:45,014
Yeah.
You like movies?

176
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:46,448
Yeah, I love
movies.

177
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,451
Yeah? Like what?
What do you like?

178
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,504
Well, my favorite
movie is probably...

179
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,056
"The Sound of Music."

180
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:56,158
<i>Not because of
the film, really,</i>

181
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,443
but because, you know,
whenever it's on,

182
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,929
my family always watches it.
It's that kind of thing.

183
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:03,466
No, that's a good movie.
It's underrated.

184
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,534
Yeah.

185
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:07,019
Can I look at these?

186
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,022
Yeah, those are--
that's a good pile.

187
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,756
<i>This is
the garbage pile.</i>

188
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,261
Oh, these are nice.

189
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,864
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

190
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,599
<i>Yeah, this one I like.
Look at it.</i>

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,634
This one's nice too.

192
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:25,187
But you don't have any
people in them really.

193
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:27,273
Yeah, well,
you know.

194
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:29,875
People look at 'em-- they
don't have to be in 'em too.

195
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,476
I like this one.

196
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:34,114
<i>Thanks.
Gotta be in the moment.</i>

197
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,533
So what--
what do you do?

198
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:42,955
I work at Pfizer in
the city-- it's a drug company.

199
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,424
Yeah, I know it well.

200
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:48,628
I have some ones with
some people in it.

201
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,397
I was just
going through these--

202
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:54,383
who's-- who's that
in this photo here?

203
00:10:56,236 --> 00:11:00,472
Oh, that was-- I don't even
know what that's doing there.

204
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:03,125
That's so weird.
That was my fiancée.

205
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,828
<i>- Your fiancée?
- Yeah.</i>

206
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,714
You were engaged.

207
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,801
Yeah,
a couple years ago.

208
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:14,687
She's gone, though.
She moved away.

209
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,740
What happened?

210
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,559
You know, um--

211
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,245
We got these genetic tests
and we were both positive

212
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:25,615
- for Tay-Sachs disease.
- Oh.

213
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:29,250
It means if we ever had kids, they'd
be, like, dead after a year, so...

214
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,736
<i>Yeah.</i>

215
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:32,605
She didn't want to adopt

216
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:35,441
and, well,
that was that.

217
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:38,244
I'm so sorry.

218
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,581
Mmm, probably for
the best.

219
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,548
<i>Leonard? Sandra?</i>

220
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,018
<i>Dessert's on the table.</i>

221
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,370
Okay!

222
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,090
You know, um...

223
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,043
our parents
wanted us to meet.

224
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:59,331
<i>Well, no, I have to
tell you the truth.</i>

225
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:02,284
Actually, I wanted
to meet you.

226
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:07,590
Yeah?

227
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,241
Yeah.

228
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,528
I saw you at
your parents' store

229
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,461
and I just...

230
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:17,133
You were asking
your mother to dance with you.

231
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,284
<i>It was
very cute.</i>

232
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,222
Sounds like something
I would do.

233
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,125
<i>You two, dessert's on the table.</i>

234
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,309
Yeah, we heard you
the first time!

235
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,581
Sorry.

236
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,484
She's really serious
about her desserts.

237
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:38,870
We should probably go.
She's...

238
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,374
gonna have an aneurysm.

239
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,375
- We'll hang out after.
- Okay.

240
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,145
Um, yeah. Okay.
I'm just gonna put this away.

241
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,350
<i>Leonard?</i>

242
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,717
Stop horsing around.

243
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:31,139
Three deliveries--
one right near here

244
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,676
and the other two
are in Sheepshead Bay.

245
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:34,744
Okay.

246
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,779
And don't lose
the clothes again.

247
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,783
- You're gonna put us out of business.
- God willing.

248
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,741
<i>We'll only be here
for a few months.</i>

249
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,610
<i>- Hey, don't walk away.
- Don't fucking touch me.</i>

250
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,613
<i>- Hey hey, where are you going?
- Get your fucking hands off me.</i>

251
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:28,998
<i>Don't walk away from me!
Michelle!</i>

252
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,536
<i>Get the fuck
back up here!</i>

253
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,355
<i>Do not
disrespect me!</i>

254
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:40,091
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:41,711
<i>You're such
a spoiled brat!</i>

256
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,495
Sorry.

257
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:46,599
<i>- For what?
- You still think you're living up in great neck?</i>

258
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,919
It's my father.
He's-- he's a little crazy.

259
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,572
You okay?

260
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,407
<i>Yeah.</i>

261
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:56,875
<i>Hey, I can hear you talking.
Who are you talking to down there?</i>

262
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,894
Do--
you live here, right?

263
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,514
Yeah. Well, my parents do.
I'm staying with them.

264
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,981
Oh, right.

265
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,650
<i>Michelle, come back here.
Don't leave like this.</i>

266
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,419
You want to
come in for a bit?

267
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:10,489
Yeah, maybe just--
that'd be great.

268
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,591
Just until he
calms down, maybe.

269
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,692
I don't want, like,
everybody to call the cops.

270
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,427
Yeah, that'd suck.

271
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:17,730
I'm Leonard.

272
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,831
- Michelle.
- Michelle.

273
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,383
Yeah, you can
hear him screaming.

274
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:24,769
<i>Come on up here!
Don't make me shout.</i>

275
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,838
Hey, do you think
you want anything?

276
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,341
<i>- No.
- Hello?</i>

277
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,875
Hi.

278
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:34,379
- Oh, Mom, this is Michelle--
- I'm-- I'm your neighbor.

279
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,231
<i>Hello, neighbor.</i>

280
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:38,668
<i>Leonard,
your dad just came home.</i>

281
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,985
We're going to have
Chinese food.

282
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:42,238
<i>Okay.</i>

283
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,972
That's nice.

284
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,463
Oh, what are
those things?

285
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:52,798
- What, that?
- Yeah.

286
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,466
Oh, that's a dreidel.

287
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:03,375
Ha.
What?

288
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,727
It smells
like mothballs.

289
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,263
It does?

290
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,966
No, it's a good thing.
It reminds me of my grandma's house.

291
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,100
Yeah, well, my parents
are just trying to protect

292
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,470
all their, you know,
designer clothes and shit.

293
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,038
From what?

294
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,456
Mot-- moths.

295
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:19,274
Right.

296
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,844
Right right, moths.
Of course.

297
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,313
So you're new
here in the building?

298
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,316
Yeah, I just moved in
last week.

299
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,984
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,652
Oh, welcome.

301
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,537
<i>Thanks.</i>

302
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:37,309
Is your-- is that your bedroom
in the back, in the corner?

303
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,044
Oh, yeah, it's right--
it's right there.

304
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,778
Right there
to the right.

305
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,965
I can see you
from my apartment.

306
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,366
- Ha.
- I'm sure I--

307
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,369
I think I've seen you
through my window.

308
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,004
- Yeah?
- Don't worry, it's not, like, a weird thing.

309
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,940
- I'm not worried.
- Okay.

310
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:53,975
Wow, those are nice.

311
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:57,246
<i>What is that, yiddish?</i>

312
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:02,217
So you live
with your father?

313
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:04,237
Uh, no,
he's just visiting.

314
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,506
I live with my dog, Rex.

315
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:10,042
Hey, yeah, you know,
I think I heard him barking.

316
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:12,761
He doesn't sound too happy.
I mean, I don't speak dog.

317
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,146
<i>Yeah, he kind of is.</i>

318
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,817
He-- we move a lot and he
doesn't like it when we move.

319
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:20,486
So...

320
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,221
He liked Hoboken a lot,

321
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,990
<i>which is weird.
But...</i>

322
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,626
God, you guys have
a lot of books.

323
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,229
What are you, like,
one of those reader guys?

324
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,015
You, like, read all the time?
You're really smart?

325
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,317
- I don't know about that.
- I can see that.

326
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,387
I don't really read
very much, you know?

327
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:42,858
I've got ADHD,
supposedly.

328
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,977
Yeah, they say
everybody has that.

329
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:47,596
I think it's a conspiracy by
the drug companies, you know?

330
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:50,182
I think you're--
hello.

331
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,351
Hey, pop.

332
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:53,935
Hello.

333
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:57,323
Oh, this is Michelle.
Michelle, that's my father,

334
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:58,924
Reuben.

335
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,493
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,830
<i>- I'm just going.
- You know, you don't have to go.</i>

337
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,098
<i>- You can stay as long as you want.
- No no, you're eating.</i>

338
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,701
And it's fine.
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:13,071
<i>I'm sure he's simmered
down now anyway, so...</i>

340
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:16,424
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.</i>

341
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,794
- See you around.
- Yeah, I hope so.

342
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,396
Okay, bye.
Bye!

343
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,398
<i>Bye.
- Bye.</i>

344
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,212
<i>Who is that girl?</i>

345
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,981
New neighbor--
you met her.

346
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:42,085
<i>I mean, Michelle.
She's new in the building.</i>

347
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,302
<i>I don't know.
I just met her myself.</i>

348
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:47,605
Listen, Leonard, tomorrow
I have a lunch with Cohen.

349
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,308
He wants you to take
those bar mitzvah pictures.

350
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,162
<i>His daughter is coming
to lunch too,</i>

351
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,913
If you want to see her.

352
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:02,354
Hello?

353
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,874
Yeah.
I heard you, pop.

354
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,240
I'll come.

355
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,960
All right.

356
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,695
I'm sorry,
all right?

357
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,747
Don't be sorry.

358
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,015
You're sleeping
all day again.

359
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,782
<i>You're like
a vampire.</i>

360
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:33,051
Oh, come on, Mom!
I'm up.

361
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,521
<i>Aren't you having lunch with
your father and the Cohens?</i>

362
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:39,491
Hmm? You don't want to be late.
Come on, here-- your pills.

363
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:42,494
No, I don't want to be late
for the beautiful Sandra.

364
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,996
She is beautiful.

365
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,999
I know.
I was joking.

366
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,068
Mmm. It's good
for business too.

367
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,070
We don't care about that.
You know that.

368
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,640
All right, all right.
Don't get bent out of shape.

369
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,344
Don't leave wet towels
on the floor.

370
00:19:58,345 --> 00:19:59,944
They'll get
all moldy, okay?

371
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,646
Mom, I'm taking a shower.

372
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,383
You don't leave in the next minute,
I'm gonna show you the world.

373
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:05,851
Oh! Stop it.

374
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,411
<i>Brighton Station and outbound Q local.</i>

375
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:25,080

this platform. Next stop,</i>

376
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,717
<i>Sheepshead Bay.
Watch the closing doors.</i>

377
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,660
Hey.

378
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:40,679
Hey.

379
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,749
What are you doing?
You don't say hello?

380
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,500
I didn't even
see you.

381
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,768
How you doing?

382
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,203
- Good.
- Cool.

383
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,205
You-- are you
going to the city?

384
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:51,440
Uh, yeah.

385
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:55,911
Great, you can
keep me company.

386
00:21:55,912 --> 00:21:58,480
Oh, yeah.

387
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,648
Hey, you ever
count doors?

388
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,119
- What?
- One two three four--

389
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,871
You try and guess which
door you're going to.

390
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:08,790
Eight nine 10--
I'm gonna be under 20--

391
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,692
11...

392
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,260
12...

393
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:17,065
- 13-- that's a bad number.
- No, it's a good number.

394
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,667
It is?

395
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:22,621
<i>Excuse me.</i>

396
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,680
So what do you do?
You work or...

397
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:35,451
Yeah. I work
at a law firm.

398
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:37,936
You're a lawyer?
I went to law school.

399
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,939
I mean, I didn't finish.
You know, I'm not a real lawyer...

400
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,107
No no no no. I'm not a
lawyer; I'm just an assistant.

401
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:45,677
An assistant for life.

402
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,248
What about you?
Do you work?

403
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:50,916
Absolutely.

404
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,817
I mean, my parents--
we got our own business.

405
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,953
Well, that's good.
You'll never get fired.

406
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:58,089
Yeah, there's no risk
in it, though.

407
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,224
It's like sometimes
you just feel fucking dead.

408
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:02,795
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

409
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,768
<i>Next stop 57th Street.</i>

410
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,172
<i>For Queens-bound service,
transfer available to the N, R, W.</i>

411
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:18,544
So let me
ask you something:

412
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:22,698
If you could do, like,
anything in the world,

413
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,817
You know, like,
anything you wanted to do,

414
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:28,069
what-- what do you
think it would be?

415
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,821
I like photography.

416
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:31,691
Really?
You're a photographer?

417
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,325
I'm gonna be.

418
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,144
Wow.

419
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:38,431
That's funny because I could--
I could sort of tell that you were,

420
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:39,865
like, creative.

421
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,702
God, that's very cool
that you're an artist.

422
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:48,373
Well, I-- I don't know
if you can call me an artist.

423
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:52,510
No, you know what? Never let
anybody discourage you from that.

424
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:53,778
I'm serious.

425
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,847
Really.

426
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:59,050
Wait, put your number
in my phone

427
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,786
and then we can,
like, text.

428
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,055
Oh, excellent.

429
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:08,326
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a special ringtone

430
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:10,061
so I know it's you
when you're calling.

431
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:11,364
All right.

432
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,031
<i>Next stop, 57th Street.</i>

433
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,534
Oh, shit,
this is my stop.

434
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:18,037
I gotta go to
a meeting with my boss.

435
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,105
You know, I'm going to the park,
like, six blocks away.

436
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:22,840
I'd rather just walk
than be in this stuffy place.

437
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:25,460
All right.

438
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:32,483
Hey, I could show you some
of my pictures sometime

439
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,486
- if you want to see something.
- Oh, that would be great.

440
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:37,588
- Yeah?
- I would love that.

441
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,893
So, Leonard, it was great
to hang out with you.

442
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:42,560
Oh, yeah.
You too.

443
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,029
And I guess I'll see you
around the building.

444
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,132
Not if I see you first.

445
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,433
Yeah, I'll see you.
Hey, if you need a place to hide,

446
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:51,036
- you know where to come.
- Oh, yeah.

447
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:52,604
- I'll keep that in mind.
- All right.

448
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:54,605
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

449
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,395
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

450
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,432
<i>It's 11 past 7:00.
You talk to him.</i>

451
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,769
<i>Where were you all day?
We were worried.</i>

452
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,321
I tried you on your cell phone.
All we got was the message.

453
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:31,292
- Oh, yeah?
- What? You don't show up for lunch.

454
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:33,528
Yeah, there was
a terrorist alert--

455
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:34,913
<i>- What?
- --In the subway.</i>

456
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,481
<i>- Terrorism?
- Yeah.</i>

457
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,919
I'll just call
everyone and apologize.

458
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,575
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

459
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:48,292
Sandra?
It's Leonard.

460
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:49,627
<i>Hi!</i>

461
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:53,064
Hey. Hey, I'm so sorry
I missed lunch today.

462
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:55,817
I just-- I was down getting
equipment for my camera

463
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:58,019
and it's like you have to wait in line
forever after they give you the number.

464
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,288
<i>I had the wrong
number and then--</i>

465
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:03,392
No no no no, it's okay.
I got there late anyway.

466
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:05,144
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

467
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:09,664
Yeah? Well, I don't know
what you're--

468
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:12,000
What you're doing
tomorrow, but...

469
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,038
I don't know, if you want
to go see a movie or something?

470
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:19,606
Maybe-- "Sound of Music"
isn't playing, but, you know...

471
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:21,960
We could find, maybe, something.

472
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:24,546
<i>My God, you're never going
to let me live that one down.</i>

473
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,882
<i>Okay, no.
Yeah, let's go.</i>

474
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,971
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah.</i>

475
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:36,374
<i>- Good.
- Yeah, that'll be fun.</i>

476
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:41,113
Okay, then I'll call you--
I'll call you tomorrow.

477
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,548
<i>- Okay.
- Okay? All right, have a nice night.</i>

478
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,967
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

479
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:08,640
Hi. What are you doing?
You're taking my picture?

480
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,726
Yeah.

481
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:12,993
I was actually trying
to get your attention.

482
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:15,096
<i>Oh.
You got it.</i>

483
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:16,498
How you doing?

484
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:17,749
Good.
What's going on?

485
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,417
<i>You look
all dressed up.</i>

486
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:22,121
Oh, well,
I'm going out.

487
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:24,239
<i>I'm gonna go dancing
with some friends of mine.</i>

488
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,807
<i>What about you?
What are you doing?</i>

489
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:28,576
I was thinking about maybe going
out, but, you know, I don't know.

490
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,577
Leonard, we can't have that.
Come with us.

491
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:32,614
<i>Hey, you heard of
a goddamn phone?</i>

492
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:36,986
Hey, you know what, Doug?
There's a fucking storm coming, man.

493
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:40,972
Why don't you
come with us?

494
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:42,640
Yeah-- maybe, yeah.

495
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,910
<i>- It's gonna be good.
- All right.</i>

496
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,961
We're gonna leave in, like, 30 minutes.
Is that all right?

497
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,214
<i>- Yeah. 30 minutes, downstairs?
- Yeah.</i>

498
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,148
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll see you down there.

499
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:57,372
My account number?

500
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,125

What's up?

512
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,423
<i>What's up, what's up?</i>

513
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:34,125
<i>Ah, this was my song
with my crew, right?</i>

514
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,560
<i>- I was dancing-- but then I had my--
- With his crew.</i>

515
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:38,096
I did.
I really did.

516
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:40,898
<i>So I go, "who's gonna
rock this party right?"</i>

517
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,069
And you guys go,
"L to the E-O-N-A-R-D"--

518
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,605
<i>- My name, right?
- Okay.</i>

519
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:49,641
Okay. So, who's gonna rock
the party right?

520
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:52,144
L to the E-O-N-A-R-D.

521
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:54,378
Who's gonna rock
the party right?

522
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,448
L to the E-O-N-A-R-D.

523
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:58,650
<i>- Ladies--
- I can't spell!</i>

524
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,486
What? You wanna bring it on?

525
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,587
'Cause I'll blow up your face
like Louis Armstrong.

526
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:06,357
And if you can't handle
the serious battle,

527
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:09,294
you mi-- you might want
to step up-- oh, shit.

528
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,496
<i>- Aww!
- It was, like, 15 years ago.</i>

529
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,798
I'm sorry! No, that was cute.
That was good.

530
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,134
<i>- It was cute?
- Yeah, you are cute.</i>

531
00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:18,237
He's my new best friend.

532
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:22,007
- I was just about to say that.
- I gotta be out by midnight.

533
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:24,910
Michelle, what are you doing?
You still doing E.?

534
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,644
<i>It's just
for a night.</i>

535
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,680
God, don't take
another one.

536
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,848
<i>Oh, come on,
I gotta do something.</i>

537
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,118
I'm living in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

538
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,488
So, Leonard,
you go clubbing a lot?

539
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:38,022
<i>- Yeah.
- You go clubbing?</i>

540
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,092
<i>Are you gonna bring it
on the dance floor?</i>

541
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:41,993
I'll do what
I have to do.

542
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:46,030
<i>He goes clubbing.</i>

543
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,166
<i>I think you're gonna
like this, Leonard.</i>

544
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,669
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna dance with me?

545
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,404
Maybe. I won't make you
look bad, you know?

546
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,307
- Hi, girls!
- Hi, Antonio!

547
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,740
Hey! Hey!

548
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,609
- All right.
- Antonio!

549
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:00,444
- What's up?
- How you doing?

550
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:02,446
- This is my friend Leonard.
- You got I.D.?

551
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:04,883
- He's fucking with you.
- I'm only kidding. Go ahead.

552
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:06,550
Getting off in 10 minutes,
all right?

553
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,269
<i>- Okay!
- All right.</i>

554
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,338
Yeah.
Relax relax relax relax.

555
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:16,564
Michelle!

556
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:42,589
Are you all right?

557
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,895
- What's the matter?
- Just go back inside, okay?

558
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:49,897
I'll be fine.

559
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:56,703
You know, you--
you can talk to me if you want.

560
00:32:56,704 --> 00:32:59,173
You know, you can
tell me anything.

561
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,248
- Is it your father?
- Oh.

562
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,670
No.

563
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,904
That guy you're with?

564
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,209
Yeah.

565
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:23,615
I was-- I was supposed to
meet up with him tonight

566
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,916
but now he says
he can't make it.

567
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,489
He says he's gonna stay
with his wife.

568
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,025
He's married;
he has a son.

569
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:37,796
Oh, fuck, I'm so
fucking stupid.

570
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,698
Don't say that.
You're not stupid.

571
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:41,700
- I am.
- You're not stupid.

572
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:43,801
- I'm so fucking stupid.
- Don't say that.

573
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,305
No, you're not.
Come here.

574
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:48,323
Don't say that,
okay?

575
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,960
He keeps telling me
he's gonna leave them.

576
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,894
You know, he tells me
over and over.

577
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,596
And I never
asked him to do that.

578
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:58,199
And now I can't think
of anything else.

579
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:03,771
- I'm such a piece of shit.
- No.

580
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,606
Look at me.

581
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:09,543
You're very high right now.
You're very emotional.

582
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:11,880
You shouldn't think
about this right now, okay?

583
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,449
Let's just go home.
I'll take you home, okay?

584
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,983
- Ahh.
- You need to calm down.

585
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:18,152
You don't want to be out
here with all these people.

586
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:20,320
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

587
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,322
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

588
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:24,175
We're gonna go home.

589
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,842
All right.
I'll be right back.

590
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:28,079
Okay.

591
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,947
I'll wait--
I'll wait right here.

592
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,117
Ahh, fuck.

593
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:34,219
Can I just get
my bag?

594
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,621
- I was in before. I left my bag.
- All right, go ahead.

595
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,856
Sorry.

596
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,733
Fucking boyfriend.

597
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:51,402
Fuck.

598
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:11,322
- What's up, man?
- What up?

599
00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:13,492
- I'm just going back in.
- You on the list?

600
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:16,594
- I was just in here.
- Yeah yeah, you and everybody else.

601
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,579
No, I just
came out, man.

602
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:20,514
I came out. I was
with Stephanie and--

603
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,751
I'm sorry, man. If you're not
on the list, I can't let you in.

604
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:24,585
- I was just inside.
- You're gonna have to move.

605
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:26,021
Go ahead.

606
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,972
Are you serious?

607
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,231
Ta-- taxi?

608
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:39,766
Who the fuck am I kidding?
I'll never get a taxi.

609
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:59,804
You have one message.

610
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,139
<i>Hey, Leonard,
it's Sandra.</i>

611
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,577
<i>- Hey, Sandra.
- Um, listen, I know we had plans tomorrow,</i>

612
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,197
<i>but I totally forgot-- tomorrow
night's my dad's birthday party</i>

613
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,000
<i>and I gotta
go to that.</i>

614
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:15,268
<i>But my mom said your parents
are going to be going too</i>

615
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:17,271
<i>so I guess
you'll be with them?</i>

616
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:19,974
<i>We could go out
after if you want.</i>

617
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:21,893
<i>So just call me and let me
know if that's all right.</i>

618
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,929
<i>Okay?
Oh, and by the way,</i>

619
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,797
<i>you're not
going to believe this,</i>

620
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,400
<i>But "the Sound of Music" is
playing on cable right now.</i>

621
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:32,052
<i>And I still love it.
It's very good.</i>

622
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:34,871
<i>Okay, call me.
Bye.</i>

623
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:57,778
<i>Hello?</i>

624
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,614
Hey, I'm back.

625
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,083
<i>Leonard,
you're awake.</i>

626
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,751
<i>Yeah.</i>

627
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,786
<i>Yeah, you--
you okay?</i>

628
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:08,389
Can you see me?
I can't see you.

629
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:10,492
No...

630
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,527
No, I'm--
I'm in bed.

631
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:16,264
Mmm. Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry about what happened.

632
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,715
I went back
into the club

633
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:21,568
<i>and I went into the
bathroom and I passed out.</i>

634
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,389
- What?
- I literally passed out in the bathroom.

635
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:27,909
Yeah, 'cause I waited
outside for, like, 30 minutes.

636
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:29,777
And they wouldn't let me
back in the club.

637
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:31,362
<i>- I tried to call you.
- Oh, God.</i>

638
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,114
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to leave you.

639
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:35,282
I'm so sorry.
It was crazy.

640
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,902
I have to go to the doctor.
I don't know what the fuck.

641
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,103
<i>I'm just
stressed out, I think.</i>

642
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:42,190
<i>Yeah. I don't know.
It sounds like you're</i>

643
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,492
<i>In a really bad
situation with that guy.</i>

644
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,360
It's horrible.
This guy,

645
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:48,829
You know, he's a partner
in a law firm where I work.

646
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,115
<i>And I got into
this thing now.</i>

647
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:53,117
<i>You know, he pays
for this apartment.</i>

648
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,253
And his mother
lives nearby,

649
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:59,657
So it's like the excuse
for when he comes out here.

650
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,275
Oh, yeah.

651
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:04,045
<i>But you know,
he's not really like that.</i>

652
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:06,014
<i>He's actually
really amazing.</i>

653
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:09,184
<i>He's brilliant and
he can be really sweet.</i>

654
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,985
<i>I think
you'd like him.</i>

655
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:14,905
My friends think he's never going
to leave his wife. What do you think?

656
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:17,858
<i>I've never met him.
You know, I don't know.</i>

657
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:19,760
<i>I don't know what
your relationship is.</i>

658
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:23,030
Ah. Well,
you know what, Leonard?

659
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:26,483
You should come and have
dinner with us tomorrow night.

660
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:29,753
<i>He's always telling me, you know,
I should hang out with friends and stuff.</i>

661
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:32,373
<i>This way you could come
and eat with us</i>

662
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,726
<i>and then you could,
like, tell me</i>

663
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,994
<i>if you think he's
telling the truth, you know?</i>

664
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:40,731
<i>Because you're a guy and then you would
be able to know that kind of a thing.</i>

665
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:43,001
Yeah, I don't know.
I gotta, uh--

666
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,469
I gotta check
my schedule.

667
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,521
You know, I got
a lot to do.

668
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:50,257
<i>I can't tell if he's
telling me the truth, and...</i>

669
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:52,860
<i>if you came,
it would be so great.</i>

670
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:55,362
I don't know, you know.
I gotta see.

671
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:58,766
<i>I need this kind of,
you know, help right now</i>

672
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,934
<i>because I'm going crazy.
I can't--</i>

673
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,871
<i>You know what?
You know something?</i>

674
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:04,905
<i>I'll bet you he would take us
to his favorite restaurant.</i>

675
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:07,240
It's called San Domenico.
It's in the city.

676
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,777
It's Italian and
it's really nice.

677
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:14,532
<i>It's great food and we, like,
drink Brandy Alexanders.</i>

678
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,266
<i>It's the best.</i>

679
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:18,902
Do you really want me to go?
Do you think it would make a difference?

680
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:20,987
I really really really
want you to go.

681
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:22,889
I think it'll make
a difference.

682
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:26,527
<i>- Please.
- Ahh.</i>

683
00:39:26,528 --> 00:39:28,096
Okay, I'll go.

684
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:29,847
<i>Thank you, Leonard.</i>

685
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:32,833
<i>I will officially shut up
now and let you go to bed.</i>

686
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:35,869
Okay.
Hey, sweet dreams.

687
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:39,056
You too.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

688
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:41,809
<i>Oh, wear
something nice.</i>

689
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,260
Good night.

690
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,516
<i>The defense didn't
really excel last week,</i>

691
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:52,603
<i>But I know in the past
Giant teams...</i>

692
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,193
<i>Hey.</i>

693
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:10,387
I think I'll have
a New Year's party this year.

694
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:11,922
What do you think?

695
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:13,523
Well, it's not even
Thanksgiving yet, Mom.

696
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,260
<i>No, but I like
to plan ahead.</i>

697
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,510
Are you going out?

698
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,864
Yeah, I'm gonna get some dinner
with a couple friends.

699
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,416
I'll be back early.

700
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,885
<i>- That's a nice suit.
- Yeah.</i>

701
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:27,572
You look handsome.

702
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:28,922
Thanks, Mom.

703
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:31,324
<i>I'm going to go out too
with your dad.</i>

704
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:33,226
<i>It's Michael Cohen's
birthday.</i>

705
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,813
If you want to stop by
later, I'm sure...

706
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,514
You're going to
be welcome.

707
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:40,083
<i>You gonna come?</i>

708
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:43,822
Ahh, maybe I will.

709
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:45,539
I'll see you later.

710
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,108
Have fun.

711
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,809
- Good evening.
- Ah, good evening, sir.

712
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,911
I'm here to meet
some people.

713
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,081
And do you have
a reservation?

714
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:18,199
Oh, it wouldn't be
under my name.

715
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,134
Do you know
when it's for?

716
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:22,036
6:30.

717
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:25,472
- Are you Mr. Kreandator?
- Kraditor.

718
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:27,375
Yes, you're with
the Blatt party.

719
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:29,143
You're the first
to arrive.

720
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:32,030
Would you like to wait at
the bar or go to your table?

721
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,463
I'll be seated.

722
00:42:33,465 --> 00:42:35,081
Can I take
your coat?

723
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:40,387
Thank you.
Jeffrey.

724
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,590
This way, sir.

725
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:45,693
<i>Would you like a drink
while you're waiting, sir?</i>

726
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:49,295
Yes, I'll have
a Brandy Alexander, please.

727
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:42,465
Here you go.

728
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,367
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

729
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:46,570
Sir, would you
like a straw?

730
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,706
<i>I can bring you
a real straw if you'd like.</i>

731
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,240
This is perfect.
Thank you.

732
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:51,708
Just...

733
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:09,244
Thanks so much.

734
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,119
Hey.

735
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,853
Hi.

736
00:44:19,855 --> 00:44:23,157
- I can't stand up.
- Ron, this is Leonard.

737
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:24,726
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.</i>

738
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:26,760
- Nice to meet you too.
- Shall I go, um--

739
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:28,596
- Shall I go here?
- Yeah, I'll sit here.

740
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:30,097
Oh, okay.

741
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:31,733
- I'll go around.
- I'm gonna come--

742
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:35,503
Um, she'll have-- oh, I see you've
got the same thing right here.

743
00:44:35,503 --> 00:44:39,340
Very nice.
Brandy Alexander and a...

744
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,610
Maker's mark
on the rocks, please.

745
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,945
Right away, Mr. Blatt.

746
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:46,713
Nice to finally
meet you there, Leonard.

747
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:48,449
Nice meeting you
as well.

748
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:50,385
So Michelle tells me
you guys are neighbors.

749
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,753
Yeah. Yeah, we live right
across the way from each other.

750
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,322
<i>- Nice. You guys can keep an eye on each other.
- </i>

751
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,659
That's my old neighborhood, actually.
My mom lives out there.

752
00:44:59,661 --> 00:45:01,394
- Is that right?
- You go to Totonno's?

753
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:03,498
<i>- Oh, sure. I know the place.
- Yeah.</i>

754
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:03,985
Good pizza.

755
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:06,467
<i>It's really great pizza.
A lot of memories there.</i>

756
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:08,885
So what kind of work
do you do?

757
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:11,572
I work for
my father's company.

758
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:14,641
Leonard's a photographer.
He's really good.

759
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:16,143
<i>- Is that right?
- Yeah, really good.</i>

760
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:17,795
What kind of photography
do you do?

761
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:21,181
<i>- Fashion?
- Ah, land-- landscapes.</i>

762
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:23,034
That's great.
That's good.

763
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,568
As long as you love it--

764
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,771
As long as you love
what you're doing.

765
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:29,289
And I think that we should get some
menus. Otherwise, we'll be late.

766
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,740
Well, they gave me
a menu already.

767
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:32,443
I don't know if it's...

768
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,679
I don't know if Michelle told you--
we've got opera tickets tonight.

769
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,081
Oh, yeah.

770
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,565
<i>We try to go as often
as we can.</i>

771
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:40,318
I mean, you know,
I know she loves it.

772
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,918
Yeah, but you
like it too.

773
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,721
<i>- I don't force you.
- Of course you don't.</i>

774
00:45:43,722 --> 00:45:45,956
<i>Absolutely, I love it.
But I know how much it means to you.</i>

775
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,425
That's true.

776
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:50,344
<i>You know what the great thing
about it is for me?</i>

777
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:53,581
- It makes you feel special when you're there.
- Mmm.

778
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,965
<i>I mean, I'm lucky--
my law firm gives me a box.</i>

779
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,385
<i>But I'm telling you something:
If you've got somebody</i>

780
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:01,155
that you love,

781
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:03,090
you take 'em to the opera.

782
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,277
<i>Hey, darlin'.</i>

783
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,530
Yeah, I ought to bring
my girlfriend.

784
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:12,365
That sounds romantic.

785
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,302
- What? You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

786
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:17,420
Leonard, you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

787
00:46:17,422 --> 00:46:18,655
- I didn't?
- No.

788
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:20,608
Well, we haven't
been going out that long--

789
00:46:20,608 --> 00:46:22,443
That's probably why.
It would've come up.

790
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:25,280
A man's got to have his secrets, Honey.
Come on.

791
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,365
<i>Come on,
leave him alone.</i>

792
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,233
I'm going to go
to the ladies' room.

793
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,702
<i>Again, baby?</i>

794
00:46:31,704 --> 00:46:33,637
I'll be right back.

795
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:44,498
<i>Hey, listen,
Leonard.</i>

796
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,032
Come here.

797
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:51,005
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to--

798
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,773
I want you to keep
an eye on her.

799
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:55,059
I want you to look out for her
for me a little bit, if you can.

800
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:57,143
She in trouble?

801
00:46:57,144 --> 00:46:59,963
I think she might
be using again.

802
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:03,918
I mean, I know I shouldn't
be saying this, but...

803
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:06,269
I mean, I can see
the signs.

804
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:09,440
- I haven't seen nothing.
- Yeah? Sure?

805
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,077
I mean, you know, she comes
from a good family,

806
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:15,211
plenty of money.

807
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:17,414
You know, and her father
goes and spends it all

808
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,400
and boom, that's it--
the whole thing goes to hell.

809
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,436
So, whatever, just do me
a favor, all right?

810
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:24,072
Just-- just keep
an eye on her.

811
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:27,023
Just don't let her get
involved in that kind of thing.

812
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:29,525
Yeah. I don't play
with that shit.

813
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:32,878
I appreciate it.

814
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,681
Thank you.

815
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:40,536
<i>You seem like you
have a good heart, you know?</i>

816
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:43,925
To tell you the truth, you
kind of remind me of my son.

817
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:48,795
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

818
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:51,798
What are you guys
talking about?

819
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,601
All right. Well, we're talking
about how beautiful you are.

820
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:57,271
Uh, the specials, please.
We're starving

821
00:47:57,271 --> 00:47:59,706
<i>- And we're kind of pressed for time.
- Yes, Mr. Blatt.</i>

822
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,108
<i>Can we have the specials?</i>

823
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:21,996
Okay, Leonard, this is
where we part ways.

824
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:24,231
Yeah, it was
good to meet you.

825
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,900
It was good to
meet you too.

826
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,269
Hey, Carl, why don't you
take him where he needs to go?

827
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,971
That's nice.
Thank you.

828
00:48:30,972 --> 00:48:32,139
<i>No problem.</i>

829
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,409
- Bye!
- Have fun.

830
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,981
Yeah, I agree.

831
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:38,039
- Hi.
- Hey.

832
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,574
How you doin'?

833
00:49:39,574 --> 00:49:42,309
Good good. Um, your parents
told me you'd be home.

834
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:44,844
They said you wanted me
to come over.

835
00:49:44,846 --> 00:49:47,181
They're at
my father's birthday.

836
00:49:47,181 --> 00:49:48,849
Yeah.
Yeah, come on in.

837
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:50,451
Come in.

838
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:53,219
Um, you want
something to drink?

839
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,355
Yeah, sure.

840
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:55,956
Yeah? Okay.

841
00:49:58,226 --> 00:49:59,976
What is this
that you're playing?

842
00:49:59,978 --> 00:50:02,813
<i>- Oh, opera.
- Opera?</i>

843
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:04,414
<i>- You like it?
- Yeah.</i>

844
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,918
<i>- Yeah.
- I've never been to the opera.</i>

845
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:10,153
I've been to "the nutcracker,"
but-- when I was little.

846
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:12,940
Yeah? What do you want,
water, soda?

847
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,509
<i>- Soda, please.
- Lot of options, yeah.</i>

848
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:19,646
I was just out with
a couple friends,

849
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,548
with some business
I have to do.

850
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,782
Thank you.

851
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:24,284
Is this
your whole family?

852
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:26,603
Yeah. Well, actually
I was adopted.

853
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:29,039
I was in line to be
King of Denmark.

854
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:31,942
<i>No, yeah, that is.</i>

855
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:34,594
That's my parents-- that's where
they met, the workmen's circle dance.

856
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:36,146
My uncle Tobias
introduced them.

857
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:37,949
That's him right there
with the mustache.

858
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:40,467
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, my dad just came over from Israel.

859
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:43,186
- And...
- Oh.

860
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:45,088
Yeah, it's cute.

861
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:47,690
That's me.

862
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,260
My mom as a girl.

863
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,360
These are dirty,
aren't they?

864
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:54,914
What's the matter?

865
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,936
Umm...

866
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:03,123
Leonard, this wasn't your idea
for me to come over, was it?

867
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:05,275
What?

868
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,277
What do you mean?

869
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:10,114
It's okay you
didn't call me back.

870
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:12,715
I--

871
00:51:12,717 --> 00:51:15,018
We don't have
to go out.

872
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:18,188
I mean,

873
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:22,510
There are a lot of
guys who just--

874
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,695
That want to
go out with me.

875
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:48,668
Oh my--
oh my God.

876
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,644
I do like you.

877
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:11,976
Well, it feels
a little strange

878
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:14,327
with my mother
staring right there.

879
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:17,358
Mmm.

880
00:53:18,793 --> 00:53:21,311
I should go

881
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:25,282
before your parents come home
and see us like this.

882
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:27,201
Are you kidding?
They'd be happy.

883
00:53:27,202 --> 00:53:29,235
Probably picking out
baby names.

884
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:32,371
God.

885
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:42,932
So I heard you're going to
take the pictures

886
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:45,302
at my brother's
bar mitzvah next month.

887
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,637
<i>Yeah.</i>

888
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:48,956
I'm taking the black
and whites-- the art shots.

889
00:53:48,956 --> 00:53:51,324
<i>That's cool.</i>

890
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:53,976
My friend's having
a party on Thursday night.

891
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:55,429
You wanna come?

892
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:57,648
I'll try to see
if I'm free.

893
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,166
Okay.

894
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,603
Will you call me?

895
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:04,838
Yeah.

896
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:08,574
<i>I'll see myself out.</i>

897
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:09,876
<i>Okay.</i>

898
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:13,612
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

899
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:50,000
<i>- Hey.
- Leonard, could you meet me up on the roof?</i>

900
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:51,284
What time is it?

901
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:53,036
<i>It's early.
It's like 6:30.</i>

902
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:54,436
<i>Could you come up?</i>

903
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:57,440
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'll come up now.

904
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,143
<i>- Thanks.
- Right.</i>

905
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:13,306
- Hey.
- Hi.

906
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:14,840
It's fucking cold.

907
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:18,244
I know. I'm sorry,
but he's downstairs.

908
00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:20,179
So what did
you think?

909
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:31,775
Leonard, what did you think of Ronald?
Tell me.

910
00:55:35,213 --> 00:55:37,563
I don't know.

911
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:40,434
What-- what do you
want me to say?

912
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:47,539
Do you think he's going
to be with me for good?

913
00:55:51,596 --> 00:55:54,063
Seriously.

914
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:55,766
I don't think so.

915
00:55:57,585 --> 00:55:59,235
Sorry.

916
00:56:08,429 --> 00:56:11,931
He's got this fucking business
trip he wants me to go on.

917
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:13,666
I don't know what to do.

918
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:18,137
Michelle, come on!
What are you doing?

919
00:56:19,572 --> 00:56:21,708
Come on, seriously.
He's the kind of guy

920
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,244
who's got this
whole life,

921
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:26,128
His family
and shit.

922
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,764
You think he's gonna
leave all that?

923
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:33,052
I know
I would.

924
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:38,375
I'd definitely leave
everything for you.

925
00:56:43,715 --> 00:56:46,016
Leonard, you're very sweet,
but I--

926
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:49,119
I think if you knew me better,
you wouldn't feel that way.

927
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:53,139
I don't care.

928
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,291
Leonard, listen to me.

929
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,210
You're like a brother
to me now.

930
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:57,333
Oh!

931
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:59,646
I know we've only known each
other for a couple of weeks.

932
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:02,248
But I-- I feel like I
could tell you anything.

933
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,818
You know? I need you
to be my friend.

934
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:07,286
You know, why don't you
tell Ronald, okay?

935
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:09,289
Tell Ronald.
Go away on your trip--

936
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:11,190
<i>- Tell Ronald?
- I don't care.</i>

937
00:57:11,192 --> 00:57:13,592
Have a great time.

938
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:15,778
Leonard, where
are you going?

939
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,780
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

940
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:19,782
Oh, Leonard,
don't say that.

941
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:23,152
Leonard!

942
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:59,304
Hey, Sandra,
it's Leonard.

943
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:01,875
Uh, I know it's really early.
You're probably sleeping,

944
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,710
but I was just checking
my schedule and I'm free.

945
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:08,380
And, yeah-- see about maybe
going out with you to this party.

946
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:11,085
So why don't you call me
when you get this?

947
00:58:11,085 --> 00:58:14,121
All right.
Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.

948
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,889
Bye.

949
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,759
<i>David, give us a turn.
Give us a turn.</i>

950
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,293
<i>How does he look?</i>

951
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:13,179
<i>And as our last event
of the day,</i>

952
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:15,764
<i>I'd like to invite mom,
dad and sister Sandra</i>

953
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:18,635
<i>to come up and give you support
for your candle-lighting.</i>

954
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,175
<i>We're gonna share the love.</i>

955
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:26,675
<i>Bring everybody
real close.</i>

956
00:59:26,677 --> 00:59:28,445
<i>Come on in, come around.</i>

957
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:30,146
<i>Not so close.</i>

958
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,985
<i>It's been such a great
afternoon, everybody.</i>

959
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:36,420
<i>What a way to
wrap things up.</i>

960
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,226
Our host, dad Michael,
would like to say a few words.

961
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:45,661
If you could give him a
tremendous round of applause...

962
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:50,467
Thank you.

963
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,568
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

964
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:57,773
<i>I just want to say that--
how proud I am</i>

965
00:59:57,775 --> 01:00:01,644
That everybody took the time
to come to David's bar mitzvah.

966
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:04,813
And on behalf of
your sister Sandra

967
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:06,483
and your mother Carol,

968
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:09,318
I want to tell you
how proud we are of you.

969
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,322
<i>I just have one question:
With all your gifts,</i>

970
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:15,492
Can you make me
a $200 Loan?

971
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:19,228
Okay, we're going to
light the last can--

972
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,829
Leonard, come on
up with us.

973
01:00:20,831 --> 01:00:23,666
<i>My daughter's boyfriend,
everybody-- come on.</i>

974
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:26,135
We're going to light
a candle for David.

975
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:39,182
<i>All right, David, at this time</i>

976
01:00:39,184 --> 01:00:40,916
<i>I'd like you to
close your eyes</i>

977
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:42,985
<i>and make a big wish.</i>

978
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:50,226
He's very popular.

979
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:53,195
I thought it was on silent.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

980
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:55,998
Help me count, everybody.
Here we go-- one two...

981
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,201
<i>- Three--
- blow out those candles!</i>

982
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:02,739
<i>Ah, mazel tov!</i>

983
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:08,679
<i>Last dance, everybody.</i>

984
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:12,014
<i>Everybody up for the last dance!
Come on.</i>

985
01:01:26,097 --> 01:01:28,931
<i>Good night, Leonard.
- Bye.</i>

986
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,574
<i>Leonard?</i>

987
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:40,277
I saw you called me.
What do you want?

988
01:01:40,277 --> 01:01:41,612
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

989
01:01:41,612 --> 01:01:43,463
<i>I know you don't want
to talk to me,</i>

990
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:45,766
<i>But I don't-- I don't
know what else to do.</i>

991
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:49,135
<i>Um, I'm not
feeling well.</i>

992
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:50,652
What's wrong?

993
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,172
<i>I was supposed to go
to the doctor today.</i>

994
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:55,240
<i>I'm-- I'm at home
right now.</i>

995
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:58,311
<i>Ron was supposed to take me,
but I don't know where he is.</i>

996
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:02,132
<i>I started bleeding really
bad a few hours ago.</i>

997
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:03,666
You're bleeding?

998
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,485
<i>I may need to go to
the hospital,</i>

999
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:07,653
<i>but I'm afraid
to go by myself.</i>

1000
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:09,822
<i>Can you come
with me, please?</i>

1001
01:02:09,822 --> 01:02:11,706
Yeah, I'll come.

1002
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:13,826
<i>Thank you so much,
Leonard.</i>

1003
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:32,862
<i>Leonard?</i>

1004
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:36,349
<i>Hey. What are you
doing down here?</i>

1005
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,119
What happened?

1006
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:46,192
I don't feel
very well.

1007
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:50,730
I'm scared something's
gonna happen.

1008
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:54,684
Wait here. I'll try
and get us a cab.

1009
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:18,190
<i>Mr. Kraditor?</i>

1010
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:19,592
<i>Come.</i>

1011
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:32,938
Is she awake?

1012
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,940
Yeah.

1013
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:37,443
<i>But she's still
sedated.</i>

1014
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:40,347
Mmm, Leonard.

1015
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:43,182
How you feelin'?

1016
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:46,987
Is there another blanket?
I'm so cold.

1017
01:03:46,987 --> 01:03:50,289
Yeah, I can feel that.

1018
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:53,025
Hey, she feels really cold.
Is that normal?

1019
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:55,360
Yeah, that's typical
from the anesthesia.

1020
01:03:55,362 --> 01:04:00,365
<i>She should be fine. She just needs
to see a doctor in a couple of weeks.</i>

1021
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,434
What'd they do
to her?

1022
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:04,670
The doctor had to
perform a D. and C.

1023
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,672
She miscarried.

1024
01:04:06,672 --> 01:04:09,943
She wasn't aware she was
pregnant until she came in today.

1025
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:21,621
They said you're okay
and that's what's important.

1026
01:04:25,592 --> 01:04:27,393
I know.

1027
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,914
Rex, hi.

1028
01:04:47,914 --> 01:04:49,548
Oh, come in.

1029
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,851
This is my dog, Rex.

1030
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,385
Oh hi, Rex.

1031
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:56,021
Oh.

1032
01:04:56,023 --> 01:04:58,590
Leonard, I gotta
go lie down.

1033
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:00,193
Yeah, you should.

1034
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:02,027
Okay, I'll bring you
the pillows.

1035
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:03,563
Thank you.

1036
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:12,804
I brought you
some water.

1037
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,110
Thank you, Leonard.

1038
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,777
Feelin' better?

1039
01:05:18,778 --> 01:05:21,047
Good.

1040
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:24,382
I had these crazy
nightmares while I was out.

1041
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,385
Yeah?

1042
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,153
Don't worry.

1043
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:29,856
I am here
to protect you.

1044
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:31,657
Ow.

1045
01:05:31,657 --> 01:05:33,760
- Don't make me laugh.
- All right.

1046
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,728
Oh, you'll protect me?

1047
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:37,896
Yeah. I have
a black belt, you know?

1048
01:05:37,898 --> 01:05:38,797
Nightmares--

1049
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:40,400
It's fine. Shh.

1050
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,668
Oh, fuck.

1051
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,938
<i>Honey?
- If he sees you, he'll go crazy.</i>

1052
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:49,809
<i>Hey, what are you
doing, little guy?</i>

1053
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:52,143
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

1054
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:53,947
Hey.

1055
01:05:53,947 --> 01:05:56,581
Oh hey, sweetheart.

1056
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:00,353
You didn't call me.

1057
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:02,422
I'm sorry.
I couldn't.

1058
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:05,224
My wife was with me all day.
I'm sorry, baby.

1059
01:06:05,224 --> 01:06:08,228
I got here as quick
as I could.

1060
01:06:08,228 --> 01:06:11,063
Today of all days?

1061
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:14,766
<i>- It's my wife.
- Oh, fuck you.</i>

1062
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:17,570
<i>She was just with me
all day.</i>

1063
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,371
Baby, I'm sorry.

1064
01:06:19,373 --> 01:06:21,407
I really am sorry.

1065
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:24,677
<i>I thought about you all day.
It was killing me,</i>

1066
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:27,012
<i>thinking about you
at the hospital like that.</i>

1067
01:06:28,547 --> 01:06:31,117
<i>What happened?
What did the doctor say?</i>

1068
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:32,751
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1069
01:06:32,753 --> 01:06:36,789
Um, I don't feel very well.
I want to be by myself.

1070
01:06:38,257 --> 01:06:40,159
You're not gonna let me
stay with you,

1071
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:41,927
- even just for a few minutes?
- No.

1072
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:45,130
I don't want you to stay
with me for a few minutes.

1073
01:06:45,132 --> 01:06:48,802
Honey, I have to go
to London tomorrow night.

1074
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:51,771
And then I'm not going to
see you for two weeks.

1075
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,677
I'm sorry.

1076
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,280
I'm sorry.

1077
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:06,152
I tried to get here
as soon as I could.

1078
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:08,221
Yeah.

1079
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:11,157
Come on, baby. Aren't you
going to tell me what's wrong?

1080
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:13,925
Ron, I would
really like it

1081
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:15,896
if you would just
leave me alone.

1082
01:07:15,896 --> 01:07:17,797
<i>- No, come on--
- Please.</i>

1083
01:07:17,797 --> 01:07:20,099
<i>- Don't be like that.
- Please can you just do that for me?</i>

1084
01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:37,250
Okay, all right.

1085
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:44,923
Well, I love you
very much,

1086
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:46,626
more than anything.

1087
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,445
That was fucking weird.

1088
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,184
<i>Leonard,
I'm sorry.</i>

1089
01:08:14,954 --> 01:08:17,657
All right, I'll--
I'll call you--

1090
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,891
No no no no, Leonard,
please don't go.

1091
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:21,795
Please.

1092
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:23,796
Leonard, could you--

1093
01:08:23,796 --> 01:08:26,131
Will you do me
a favor, please?

1094
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:28,134
Yeah.

1095
01:08:30,203 --> 01:08:33,171
Could you write something
on my arm with your finger

1096
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:34,890
while I fall asleep?

1097
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:38,278
<i>My grandma used to do it
when I was little.</i>

1098
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,216
<i>Mmm.</i>

1099
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:14,591
<i>...So funny.
Oh, you know what?</i>

1100
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:18,010
<i>My parents finally got the
pictures back from the bar mitzvah.</i>

1101
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:21,847
Oh, they-- they like the
dancing shots in the ballroom?

1102
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:23,815
They love them.

1103
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:26,101
- Good.
- Thank you, dear.

1104
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:28,436
You're very welcome.

1105
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:32,609
Um, I got
something for you.

1106
01:10:34,211 --> 01:10:36,328
- A gift?
- Yeah.

1107
01:10:36,329 --> 01:10:38,146
It's-- you know,
it's winter out, it's cold,

1108
01:10:38,148 --> 01:10:40,682
and I noticed that
you don't wear any gloves.

1109
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:42,016
Oh, these are nice.

1110
01:10:42,018 --> 01:10:43,603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1111
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,104
You like 'em?

1112
01:10:45,104 --> 01:10:46,771
Yeah, it's got
the stitching.

1113
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:48,474
I've never seen
anything like this.

1114
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:49,975
<i>- Cool.
- Little silver thing.</i>

1115
01:10:49,976 --> 01:10:51,761
Good.

1116
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:57,867
That was very sweet
of you. Thanks.

1117
01:10:57,868 --> 01:10:59,734
No big deal.

1118
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:07,643
What's wrong?
You okay?

1119
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:08,744
Yeah.

1120
01:11:08,746 --> 01:11:11,180
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about a friend of mine.

1121
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,882
She's kind of going through
some tough stuff, so...

1122
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:17,869
I don't want you and I
talkin' about it--

1123
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:19,471
No no,
it's okay.

1124
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:25,578
I love your hands.

1125
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:28,381
They're so gentle.

1126
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:37,724
<i>I hate these
fucking scars.</i>

1127
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:43,128
Leonard, I, um...

1128
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:46,649
I want to take care
of you.

1129
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:48,818
I feel like I
understand you.

1130
01:11:48,819 --> 01:11:50,536
You're different.

1131
01:11:50,537 --> 01:11:53,322
You don't pretend to be
something you're not.

1132
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,876
So you don't have to
worry about anything.

1133
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,877
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

1134
01:11:58,878 --> 01:12:01,346
Thank you.

1135
01:12:01,347 --> 01:12:04,065
You know, I got
a lot of stuff

1136
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:07,119
going on
right now that's...

1137
01:12:09,707 --> 01:12:11,791
I don't even know what
it's like to just

1138
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,876
be myself right now.

1139
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:15,944
No, I-- I understand.

1140
01:12:21,201 --> 01:12:23,235
Are you in a hurry
somewhere or what?

1141
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:24,936
No, I just wanted to
pay the check

1142
01:12:24,938 --> 01:12:26,538
so we could
get out of here.

1143
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:28,140
Okay.

1144
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:30,643
Oh, fuck.

1145
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,645
Probably my father calling:
"How's the date?"

1146
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,551
Uh, I gotta take this.
Yeah, it's my friend.

1147
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:40,552
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be right back.

1148
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:42,554
Sorry.
We'll go in a minute.

1149
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,161
<i>- Michelle?
- Hey.</i>

1150
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:51,980
<i>- Hey.
- I just got your text from yesterday.</i>

1151
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:54,917
Yeah, well, I knew you had your
two-week follow-up thing today.

1152
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,402
How'd it go?

1153
01:12:56,403 --> 01:12:59,371
It went fine. Everything's--
everything's good.

1154
01:12:59,372 --> 01:13:00,773
The doctor says I'm good.

1155
01:13:00,774 --> 01:13:02,007
Good.

1156
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:03,574
'Cause I didn't
hear from you.

1157
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:06,029
No, I'm fine. I just
came home and got into bed

1158
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:07,613
and I've been lazy.

1159
01:13:07,613 --> 01:13:09,731
<i>Listen, Leonard,</i>

1160
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:12,217
<i>Ron got back
from London today.</i>

1161
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:14,537
<i>I decided I'm going to
go to his office later</i>

1162
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:17,672
<i>and I'm just--
I'm just gonna end it.</i>

1163
01:13:17,673 --> 01:13:19,809
Really?
Today?

1164
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:21,426
<i>Yeah.</i>

1165
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:24,162
<i>I've been thinking about what
you said and you were right.</i>

1166
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:26,881
<i>Nothing's going
to change.</i>

1167
01:13:26,882 --> 01:13:29,618
It's not fair what
he's doing, you know?

1168
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:33,521
It's not fair to me and it's
definitely not fair to his family.

1169
01:13:33,523 --> 01:13:37,059
<i>He still doesn't even know what
happened to me at the hospital.</i>

1170
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,296
Well, do you want me to come
with you and wait outside or--

1171
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:43,198
<i>No, don't worry.
I'll be strong.</i>

1172
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:45,367
<i>Just wish me luck.</i>

1173
01:13:45,368 --> 01:13:46,953
Well, good luck.

1174
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:49,956
<i>Thanks.  I'll text you
after it's over, all right?</i>

1175
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:51,623
Okay. Bye.

1176
01:13:57,396 --> 01:14:00,381
<i>I haven't seen units
like that in 30 years.</i>

1177
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:02,969
They're ancient.
We gotta get something new.

1178
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:05,654
<i>There are some new
Italian machines</i>

1179
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:07,372
<i>- they're Tintoretto.
- Tintoretto?</i>

1180
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:09,475
<i>- Yeah, Tintoretto.
- Leonard?</i>

1181
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:10,676
Hey, pop.

1182
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:12,578
Leonard.

1183
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,796
Mr. Cohen.

1184
01:14:14,797 --> 01:14:17,298
Reuben, I'm going to
take off. We'll talk.

1185
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,034
All right.

1186
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:21,203
I'm glad I
caught you, Leonard.

1187
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:24,405
- Listen, tomorrow...
- Yeah?

1188
01:14:24,407 --> 01:14:27,710
...Do you think you could come
by my office, above my cleaners?

1189
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,779
- Yeah.
- I got something I'd like to talk to you about.

1190
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,613
- How's noon?
- Uh...

1191
01:14:32,614 --> 01:14:34,483
Well, I think I have
to work tomorrow.

1192
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:36,018
Go-- go meet
with Michael.

1193
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:37,886
- The deliveries...
- It's okay.

1194
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,372
Okay. Good.

1195
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:41,122
I'll see you then.

1196
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,109
Reuben.

1197
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:45,444
I'll bring a nice bottle
of champagne for--

1198
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:47,712
Oh, no,
we got plenty.

1199
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:49,015
No, it's my pleasure.

1200
01:14:49,015 --> 01:14:50,216
- Yes, all right.
- Okay.

1201
01:14:50,216 --> 01:14:51,550
- Okay.
- I'll see you at noon.

1202
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:53,051
All right.

1203
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:56,072
Bye bye.

1204
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:57,706
<i>Hey, pop,
where's mom?</i>

1205
01:14:57,707 --> 01:15:00,576
<i>- There's no more Seltzer.
- She's out getting stuff.</i>

1206
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:04,896
<i>She's having another one of her famous
New Year's parties tomorrow night.</i>

1207
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,488
How are you?

1208
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:17,493
Are you happy
these days?

1209
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:19,293
I'm okay.

1210
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:22,081
I feel anxious.

1211
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,515
I'm okay.

1212
01:15:25,518 --> 01:15:29,203
I was just talking to--
to Michael.

1213
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:31,606
I want to make sure
you'll be taken care of

1214
01:15:31,608 --> 01:15:33,675
with the merger
and all this.

1215
01:15:33,676 --> 01:15:37,328
It's why I'm doing it,
so you have a future.

1216
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:40,466
You'll have
your health insurance.

1217
01:15:41,835 --> 01:15:43,920
I appreciate that,
Pop.

1218
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:52,010
I'm going swimming in the ocean
with Polar Bear Club

1219
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:53,645
On New Year's day.

1220
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:56,164
Be careful
out there.

1221
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,434
I will.

1222
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:02,988
What? Somebody is sending
you something here?

1223
01:16:05,225 --> 01:16:08,176
Yeah, it's just
my friend.

1224
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:11,113
All right.
I forgot to do something.

1225
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:13,716
I'll clean this up
later, all right?

1226
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:40,109
Hey.

1227
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,144
I just got
your text.

1228
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,179
I've been worried
about you.

1229
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,698
You all right?

1230
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:49,618
It's over.
I did it.

1231
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:55,858
He yelled and screamed
but I did it.

1232
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:57,960
Sorry.

1233
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,095
It's so fucked up.

1234
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:06,034
I'm so lost, Leonard.

1235
01:17:09,256 --> 01:17:12,425
I have this friend
in San Francisco.

1236
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:15,793
She's going away for a while
and she said I could

1237
01:17:15,795 --> 01:17:18,831
go out and stay at
her place.

1238
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:21,233
So I'm gonna go out there

1239
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:23,234
and figure things out.

1240
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:29,891
Don't go.

1241
01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:38,466
I love you.

1242
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:43,372
I do.

1243
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:44,890
Oh, God.

1244
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,677
Leonard--

1245
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:51,412
I know you may not
want to hear it,

1246
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:52,965
but it's true.

1247
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,851
Leonard, you don't
love me, okay?

1248
01:17:56,853 --> 01:17:59,087
- Don't say that.
- I'm completely fucked up.

1249
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:01,122
Don't say that.
I'm not a little kid.

1250
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:04,826
This isn't some
stupid fucking crush.

1251
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:08,096
You think I don't
know love?

1252
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:10,416
I was supposed to
get married.

1253
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:13,101
Her parents are the ones
that called it off

1254
01:18:13,103 --> 01:18:15,453
because of
this medical thing and...

1255
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:20,509
then she went away.

1256
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:26,414
I couldn't find her.

1257
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:33,572
And I tried to hurt myself and
they put me in the hospital.

1258
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:35,724
And I--

1259
01:18:37,594 --> 01:18:40,328
I didn't--

1260
01:18:43,032 --> 01:18:45,734
I didn't think that
I'd ever

1261
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:48,052
love anyone again.

1262
01:18:53,592 --> 01:18:55,978
And I lov--
I love you.

1263
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:57,747
I do.

1264
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:02,951
Leonard, I...

1265
01:19:06,323 --> 01:19:08,908
You--

1266
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:11,743
You think if I got to know
you that I wouldn't love you,

1267
01:19:11,743 --> 01:19:15,130
but I do know you and
I love you even more.

1268
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:17,432
I understand you,
Michelle.

1269
01:19:17,434 --> 01:19:19,734
I'm fucked up too.

1270
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:29,060
I will never
walk away from you.

1271
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,462
Never.

1272
01:19:31,797 --> 01:19:35,917
He left you.
I'd never do that.

1273
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:38,203
I'll take care
of you

1274
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:42,692
because that's
what you deserve.

1275
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:45,144
You deserve
to be loved.

1276
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:52,984
And maybe you'll
learn to love me too.

1277
01:20:34,027 --> 01:20:35,359
Ahh!

1278
01:20:55,114 --> 01:20:57,048
I love you.

1279
01:21:20,372 --> 01:21:22,239
Oh.

1280
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,275
You're so beautiful.

1281
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,779
You're so beautiful.

1282
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,213
Hi.

1283
01:22:22,018 --> 01:22:23,953
That was beautiful.

1284
01:22:23,953 --> 01:22:25,753
<i>Yeah.</i>

1285
01:22:27,707 --> 01:22:30,876
You know what
I just realized?

1286
01:22:30,877 --> 01:22:33,279
I never really
saw you.

1287
01:22:35,297 --> 01:22:37,582
I never saw you
either.

1288
01:22:39,985 --> 01:22:43,320
I can feel you, you know?
I can really feel you.

1289
01:22:43,322 --> 01:22:45,256
<i>Yeah.</i>

1290
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:53,864
Can you see me now?

1291
01:22:53,865 --> 01:22:55,617
<i>Yes.</i>

1292
01:22:58,887 --> 01:23:01,289
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

1293
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:13,402
You're the most beautiful,
most amazing woman ever.

1294
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:24,863
What are we
gonna do, Leonard?

1295
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,750
I can't stay here.

1296
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:32,503
He's not gonna keep
paying for this apartment.

1297
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:35,189
<i>And I think I've really
got to go to San Francisco.</i>

1298
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,259
Then I'll just
go with you.

1299
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,645
Are you serious?

1300
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:41,680
<i>Yeah.</i>

1301
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,914
I told you, Michelle,
I love you.

1302
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:48,386
I'll do anything for you.

1303
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:53,207
Do you really
love me, Leonard?

1304
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,775
<i>Yes.</i>

1305
01:23:54,777 --> 01:23:57,328
Michelle,
let's just go.

1306
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,913
Tomorrow.

1307
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:02,251
Yeah.

1308
01:24:02,252 --> 01:24:04,152
Fuck it,
let's just go.

1309
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:06,054
Let's just get
the fuck out of here.

1310
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,606
<i>Yeah, fuck it.
I've got no reason to stay here.</i>

1311
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:11,176
I just want to be with you,
wherever that is.

1312
01:24:11,177 --> 01:24:13,712
I don't care.

1313
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:16,347
You're crazy.

1314
01:24:16,349 --> 01:24:18,434
That's what
they told me.

1315
01:24:18,435 --> 01:24:21,168
<i>All right, I'm gonna
work on the tickets.</i>

1316
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:23,872
You don't worry
about anything, okay?

1317
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:25,306
I'll call you
in a little bit.

1318
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:27,108
Okay.

1319
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,144
I love you.

1320
01:24:29,145 --> 01:24:30,945
<i>Okay.</i>

1321
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:33,213
Okay.
Bye for now.

1322
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,720
<i>Bye.</i>

1323
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,238
Good night.

1324
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:05,430
<i>Leonard?</i>

1325
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:08,115
Have you ever seen
"Benny Hill"?

1326
01:25:08,117 --> 01:25:11,019
<i>I just got the new
DVD set.</i>

1327
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,770
Yeah, he's good, Pop.

1328
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,475
What are you doing,
Leonard?

1329
01:25:16,475 --> 01:25:20,011
Just looking at some stuff
online, Mom.

1330
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:36,345
What are you doing?
Do you need help?

1331
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,930
No no, thanks.
I got it.

1332
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:40,925
<i>This is the best we
have at this price.</i>

1333
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,582
I just want it
to be right, you know?

1334
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:49,784
Of all the rings,

1335
01:26:49,786 --> 01:26:53,505
I-I think this is
the best choice.

1336
01:27:01,898 --> 01:27:03,864
Yeah, it's nice.

1337
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:08,853
I want it.

1338
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:10,521
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

1339
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:12,606
You'll be using
a credit card?

1340
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:14,993
Cash.

1341
01:27:14,993 --> 01:27:17,028
I'll get you
your receipt.

1342
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:19,747
Thank you.
Seven...

1343
01:27:19,748 --> 01:27:22,067
<i>Hello?
- I got our tickets.</i>

1344
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:24,469
I'm packed and ready to go.
Is everything good with you?

1345
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,204
<i>Yeah,
everything's fine.</i>

1346
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:28,439
<i>I called my girlfriend
in San Francisco.</i>

1347
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,274
<i>- I'm excited.
- Me too.</i>

1348
01:27:30,275 --> 01:27:33,377
So, listen, meet me in the
courtyard at 8:00, all right?

1349
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,747
I got us a car to take us
to the airport.

1350
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:37,414
<i>- 8:00.
- All right.</i>

1351
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,684
<i>I'll-- I'll definitely
be there.</i>

1352
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:41,386
I can't wait to
see you.

1353
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:43,387
<i>- Me too.
- Oh, one other thing.</i>

1354
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:45,289
<i>- Yeah?
- I got you a surprise.</i>

1355
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,125
<i>A surprise?
What'd you get me?</i>

1356
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:49,793
Uh, it wouldn't be
a surprise if I told you!

1357
01:27:49,795 --> 01:27:52,663
<i>My God.
You are so weird.</i>

1358
01:27:52,664 --> 01:27:54,532
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

1359
01:27:54,533 --> 01:27:56,033
Okay, bye.

1360
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:57,869
<i>Bye.</i>

1361
01:27:57,871 --> 01:28:02,373
<i>I'm glad you could make it in
today for our meeting, Leonard.</i>

1362
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,576
<i>Just take a look
around the business,</i>

1363
01:28:04,577 --> 01:28:06,711
<i>acquaint yourself with
what's going on here.</i>

1364
01:28:06,712 --> 01:28:11,399
A kid's got to start thinking
about his future sometime.

1365
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:13,216
Oh, I do.

1366
01:28:13,217 --> 01:28:17,189
Well, this is your opportunity
right here, right now.

1367
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:19,090
<i>It could be
a terrific thing--</i>

1368
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:21,525
<i>A fresh start for
you and Sandra.</i>

1369
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:24,779
<i>My daughter
is crazy about you.</i>

1370
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,814
<i>And believe me, there's
lots of guys after her.</i>

1371
01:28:27,815 --> 01:28:30,969
The most important thing is
to give her what she wants

1372
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,421
because she is
my life.

1373
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:36,006
So I'm going to ask you
a question now.

1374
01:28:36,007 --> 01:28:38,659
<i>And I'm going to
be direct with you.</i>

1375
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:40,462
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

1376
01:28:43,314 --> 01:28:44,983
Are you a fuck-up?

1377
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:49,386
I don't think so.

1378
01:28:49,387 --> 01:28:53,225
You-- you know why I'm asking
you this question, right?

1379
01:28:53,225 --> 01:28:56,778
Well, I think it's
'cause of Sandra.

1380
01:28:56,779 --> 01:28:59,581
<i>It's Sandra
and the merger.</i>

1381
01:28:59,582 --> 01:29:01,766
This is a terrific
thing for you,

1382
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:03,335
a terrific thing,

1383
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:05,002
<i>to turn your life
around.</i>

1384
01:29:05,003 --> 01:29:06,220
I understand that.

1385
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:08,239
<i>This business is
important to me.</i>

1386
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,993
Your father has a hell of
a good location out there.

1387
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:14,628
<i>And we're going to be
moving into that space soon.</i>

1388
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:18,115
<i>And when we do, there is
an opportunity here</i>

1389
01:29:18,117 --> 01:29:20,518
<i>for you, for your father,
for your family,</i>

1390
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:22,170
<i>for your future family,</i>

1391
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:25,673
If you apply yourself,
and I know you're going to.

1392
01:29:25,675 --> 01:29:29,310
I think you know how important
this is for everybody.

1393
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:31,011
Yes.

1394
01:29:32,381 --> 01:29:34,364
Good. Good.

1395
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:41,189
What's in the bag?

1396
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:44,609
Just...

1397
01:29:44,609 --> 01:29:47,378
It's a surprise.
It's a gift.

1398
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,247
<i>- Oh.
- It's a secret.</i>

1399
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:51,300
Yeah, big secret.

1400
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:53,518
Okay, so I'll
see you tonight, right?

1401
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:55,270
Uh-huh, yeah,
at the party.

1402
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,521
<i>We're gonna celebrate
New Year's together.</i>

1403
01:29:57,523 --> 01:30:00,225
I'm about to have lunch.
Do you want to have lunch with me?

1404
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:03,595
No, I've got to go do some
shopping for my mom for the party.

1405
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:05,079
<i>- Okay.
- All right.</i>

1406
01:30:05,081 --> 01:30:06,347
Good.

1407
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:08,082
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay, Leonard.

1408
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,217
- Thanks for coming.
- Bye.

1409
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,021
<i>You know, we celebrate--</i>

1410
01:30:14,023 --> 01:30:17,809
<i>we celebrate the New Year
twice a year, you know?</i>

1411
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,345
Because at
Rosh Hashanah and...

1412
01:30:20,345 --> 01:30:22,380
- All right, it's good.
- Thank you, thank you.

1413
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:24,181
It's a 1998.

1414
01:30:24,182 --> 01:30:26,184
- '98?
- 1998.

1415
01:30:28,421 --> 01:30:29,753
It's really very good.

1416
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:32,457
I go there, and they
have a theater with--

1417
01:30:32,457 --> 01:30:34,025
For my princess.

1418
01:30:34,027 --> 01:30:36,395
Thank you.

1419
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:38,729
<i>Hey, Reuben,
you sure we got enough?</i>

1420
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:41,599
We've got this to last
until midnight.

1421
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
We are in
a good shape, huh?

1422
01:30:43,601 --> 01:30:45,802
Good.

1423
01:30:45,804 --> 01:30:48,457
Reuben, why don't you
ask Leonard

1424
01:30:48,457 --> 01:30:50,891
- to help you with that?
- All right.

1425
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:54,729
He's trying to open a box--
did you see that?--

1426
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,631
With a plastic spoon.

1427
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,601
- Enjoying?
- Having a great time.

1428
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:04,805
<i>Leonard, could you
help me for a minute?</i>

1429
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:06,541
<i>I need to open
everything up.</i>

1430
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,109
Be right out, Pop.

1431
01:31:35,854 --> 01:31:37,954
Hey, Lenny, you still
taking all those pictures?

1432
01:31:37,956 --> 01:31:39,724
Hey.

1433
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:42,493
Leonard, can you help me
with this, please?

1434
01:31:45,363 --> 01:31:47,364
<i>Hello?
- Hi, Reuben.</i>

1435
01:31:47,365 --> 01:31:49,367
<i>- Yeah.
- I hope we're not late.</i>

1436
01:31:49,368 --> 01:31:52,436
<i>No, it's okay.
Come on in.</i>

1437
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:54,439
The Cohens are on
their way up.

1438
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:57,175
- Oh, yeah?
- Sandra is with them.

1439
01:31:57,176 --> 01:31:58,909
Happy New Year, Pop.

1440
01:31:58,911 --> 01:32:00,912
Happy New Year.

1441
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:03,213
- Leonard! You look so good.
- Yeah?

1442
01:32:03,215 --> 01:32:05,649
- Oh, thank you. It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1443
01:32:24,235 --> 01:32:26,136
Will you both hurry up?

1444
01:32:27,823 --> 01:32:30,891
<i>- Hi!
- Happy New Year to you.</i>

1445
01:32:30,893 --> 01:32:32,877
<i>Hi!
There's lots of food.</i>

1446
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:36,931
<i>Thank you so much.
- I'll be right back.</i>

1447
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:38,949
Leonard?

1448
01:32:39,918 --> 01:32:41,368
Are you leaving?

1449
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,893
I saw on the computer that you
checked travel sites last night.

1450
01:32:51,462 --> 01:32:53,765
<i>You're going
with her?</i>

1451
01:32:53,765 --> 01:32:55,966
Yes.

1452
01:33:05,728 --> 01:33:08,162
I have to go, Mom.

1453
01:33:08,163 --> 01:33:11,015
But you don't even
have a bag.

1454
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:13,818
I threw it
out the window.

1455
01:33:16,622 --> 01:33:19,707
You don't have to
worry about me.

1456
01:33:19,707 --> 01:33:21,842
I'm gonna be okay.

1457
01:33:33,622 --> 01:33:35,640
I love you
very much.

1458
01:33:37,676 --> 01:33:40,043
I know you do.

1459
01:33:40,045 --> 01:33:41,945
This is your home.

1460
01:33:41,947 --> 01:33:44,681
You come back here
whenever you want. Mmm?

1461
01:33:46,868 --> 01:33:50,188
Tell Papa that
I'm sorry.

1462
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:54,809
And I hope I didn't
mess things up.

1463
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:57,427
And that I'm happy.

1464
01:33:57,429 --> 01:33:59,997
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

1465
01:34:01,317 --> 01:34:03,851
We want you happy.

1466
01:34:03,853 --> 01:34:05,286
I love you.

1467
01:34:05,287 --> 01:34:07,221
Thanks, Mom.

1468
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:09,189
I have to go.

1469
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:49,012
Uh, Michelle,
it's Leonard.

1470
01:34:49,014 --> 01:34:52,182
I'm downstairs.
It's 8:05.

1471
01:34:52,184 --> 01:34:54,252
Call me or I'll see you
down here. All right.

1472
01:34:54,252 --> 01:34:55,420
Bye.

1473
01:35:34,659 --> 01:35:36,961
Please come.

1474
01:35:40,233 --> 01:35:42,048
Please come down.

1475
01:36:11,212 --> 01:36:13,564
I was just calling you.

1476
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:15,867
The car's out front
waiting.

1477
01:36:19,438 --> 01:36:21,139
I'm not going.

1478
01:36:24,126 --> 01:36:26,194
<i>I'm not going.</i>

1479
01:36:27,563 --> 01:36:30,597
He left his family
for me.

1480
01:36:30,599 --> 01:36:34,051
He told
his wife everything.

1481
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:37,271
He says he wants
to get married.

1482
01:36:37,273 --> 01:36:41,592
<i>I finally let him know
about my miscarriage</i>

1483
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:43,761
<i>and that really
changed things for him.</i>

1484
01:36:46,298 --> 01:36:48,166
<i>Leonard,</i>

1485
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:51,586
You're such
a wonderful person.

1486
01:36:51,587 --> 01:36:53,921
<i>But he left them for me.</i>

1487
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:57,359
<i>You know, I've got to
give it a chance.</i>

1488
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,729
<i>I feel like if I wasn't
with Ronald,</i>

1489
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:02,930
<i>we could...</i>

1490
01:37:04,315 --> 01:37:07,851
Just go.

1491
01:37:07,853 --> 01:37:09,253
I'm so sorry.

1492
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:11,271
Go!

1493
01:37:11,273 --> 01:37:14,426
<i>He's gonna pay you back
for the tickets, okay?</i>

1494
01:37:14,426 --> 01:37:16,994
I'm sorry.

1495
01:42:27,639 --> 01:42:30,408
Are you okay?

1496
01:42:30,408 --> 01:42:33,060
What's going on?
Where were you?

1497
01:42:35,497 --> 01:42:37,730
I got you something.

1498
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:39,466
Yeah?

1499
01:42:55,449 --> 01:42:57,384
Oh my God.

1500
01:42:58,819 --> 01:43:01,389
Leonard.

1501
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:03,640
I--

1502
01:43:14,453 --> 01:43:17,020
You're crying.

1503
01:43:19,873 --> 01:43:21,725
I'm just happy.

1504
