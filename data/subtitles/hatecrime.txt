00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,031
Good morning, Jack.

2
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,005
Hey, Kathleen.

3
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,079
Morning, hon.

4
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,214
New neighbors moving in, huh?

5
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,742
I reckon.

6
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,351
Have you met them?

7
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,517
No, not yet.

8
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,314
Are we still on for tomorrow morning?

9
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,655
- Of course.
- You wear a hat.

10
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,926
'Cause I want to keep
that hot head of yours cool.

11
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,990
Okay.

12
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,626
Hey, man, thank you so much.

13
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,590
- No problem. Are you the new owner?
- Yes. I am.

14
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,564
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Robbie Levinson. I live next door.

15
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,997
Okay, Chris Boyd.

16
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,960
You need any help unloading?

17
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
Oh, no. That's all right.
I got some help coming.

18
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,636
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

19
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,305
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
I'm right over here.

20
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,037
- I appreciate it. It was nice to meet you.
- You, too.

21
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,112
God bless.

22
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,480
(SUMMONING DOG)

23
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,557
(DOG YELPING)

24
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,957
Are you gonna get out of bed?

25
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,958
What time is it?

26
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,657
It's time to get up.

27
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,660
I have to buy a new housewarming present.

28
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,124
For who?

29
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,301
- New neighbor's moving in.
- When?

30
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,737
Right now. I just met him.

31
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,867
What's he like?

32
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,103
Seems nice.

33
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,742
You could close this.

34
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,005
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

35
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,946
Why am I doing this again?

36
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,915
Because you owe me.

37
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,216
You're gonna owe me after this one.

38
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,383
Howdy.

39
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,723
Hey, man.

40
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,765
Why don't you hop up?
Let's get this thing unloaded.

41
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,060
All right.

42
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,565
ROBBIE: Trey!

43
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,403
Sorry. Must be a little too excited.

44
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,945
I'm getting married, you know.

45
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,482
- Yeah, I heard.
- See you after work.

46
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,075
Wait. I thought we were having lunch today.

47
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,012
Oh, you're right. Like I said,
see you at noon, at the diner.

48
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,487
Alton, come on, man!

49
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,655
Trey!

50
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,459
Dude, you see that?

51
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,844
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

52
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,652
ALTON: Everywhere you go.

53
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,254
Sure you don't need an extra hand?

54
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:47,840
Open it.

55
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,704
Let me see what my
hard-earned money's got me.

56
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,611
TREY: Ohhh.

57
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,311
Well, it took long enough to get here.

58
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,415
Make it official, get it framed, so I can retire.

59
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,419
Yeah right, like that'll happen.
You'd drive yourself crazy.

60
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,252
Not to mention Mom.

61
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,195
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Hey, could I get a clamp?

62
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,059
- Clamp.
- Thank you.

63
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,294
I can't believe we've had so many cats
to spay this week.

64
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,731
- Get the scissors?
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,306
BARBARA: Jim, what are you looking for?

66
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,601
Nothing.

67
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,833
I can help you. I know where everything is.

68
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,172
I've got it.

69
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,341
BARBARA: Okay, okay.

70
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,976
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

71
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,481
Where are the Rascos?

72
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,984
On the shelf in front of you. See them?

73
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,151
Stubborn.

74
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,781
- Big news there.
- Yeah.

75
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,587
TREY: So are you, though.

76
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,155
- BARBARA: What?
- Stubborn.

77
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,560
I am not.

78
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,890
All right, all right, I am sometimes.

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,696
But I have an excuse.
I've always been that way.

80
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,569
(SIGHING)

81
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,537
He's changing.
I don't know what's going on.

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,870
Of course he's changing, Mom.
He's getting old.

83
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,409
Watch your mouth.

84
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,375
Maybe you should go on a date.

85
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,648
Got someone in mind?

86
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,917
You two should get out of the house
and talk to each other.

87
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,487
Yeah, well, he's not much
of a conversationalist.

88
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,089
He has that group, you know,
that he talks to,

89
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,716
so... Whatever.

90
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,491
Of course, it would help
if we had something to talk about.

91
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,656
Like?

92
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:24,366
Like, I don't know... a child, maybe.

93
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,534
- Or something.
- Or something.

94
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,004
I could donate an egg.

95
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,733
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST)

96
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,378
I was only kidding.

97
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,711
Thank you. Please, no eggs, no eggs.

98
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,248
Mom brought up grandkids again today.

99
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,348
ROBBIE: She is relentless.

100
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,423
We should... We should look into it.

101
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,531
Seriously?

102
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,203
Why not?

103
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,568
Now we're gonna be legit and all.

104
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,673
Let's worry about one thing at a time.

105
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,781
You want a baby?

106
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,748
You want a baby, don't you?

107
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,166
PASTOR BOYD: "When Isaac
was a young boy,

108
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,666
"God commanded Abraham

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,502
"to take his son up to Mount Moriah

110
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,303
"and offer him up as a sacrifice to God."

111
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:46,209
Now, the reason he did that
was he wanted to test Abraham's faith.

112
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,578
You're late.

113
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,556
Excuse me, children.

114
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,193
(WHISPERING) You think you can try
and be here on time?

115
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,729
I mean, everything we do
sets an example for these children.

116
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,389
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,694
Children, Christopher's going
to finish the story.

118
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,771
I have to go work on my sermon.
I'll see you later.

119
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,297
CHILD: Bye.

120

"for his faith in God was strong."

- Didn't wear a hat, did you?
- I got sunscreen on.

125
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,614
Okay.

126
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,493
Hey, how old were you
when you got married?

127
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,764
Sixteen big ones.

128
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,630
- Barely old enough to wipe my own ass.
- Really?

129
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,032
Well, I had to,

130
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,574
otherwise Charlie would have been a bastard.

131
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,442
He still turned out to be a bastard,
just a different kind.

132
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,240
- Will you hand me the shovel?
- Oh, sure.

133
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,647
Thank you.

134
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,980
So, you had a shotgun wedding.

135
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,254
Yeah, I guess I did!

136
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,991
Didn't have much of a choice back then.

137
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,627
How come you asking me
so many personal questions?

138
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,990
Don't tell me you got a girl.

139
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,926
KATHLEEN: Sorry.

140
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,402
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)

141
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,507
Trey convinced me to have
a commitment ceremony.

142
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,003
A what?

143
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,846
It's like a wedding. Only not legal.

144
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,707
Well, what do you need that for?

145
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,477
Yeah, my point exactly.

146
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,222
Well, you kids.

147
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,391
I don't know, but whatever it is,

148
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,685
you just count me in.

149
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,531
- I like that one.
- Which one?

150
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,095
- That one.
- No.

151
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,933
It's too gaudy.

152
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,505
Come on, we agreed on something
more simple.

153
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,598
Okay, pick one. I'm happy if you're happy.

154
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,546
Okay, can we see the one
in the corner, please?

155
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,114
Sure, absolutely.

156
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,581
We can always order something from
our catalog, as well.

157
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,878
ROBBIE: Okay.

158
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,583
Thanks.

159
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,589
Are you two having a wedding?

160
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,057
God forbid, don't call it a wedding.

161
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,428
It's just a small ceremony.

162
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,467
I love that, I think that's so cool.

163
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,970
When two people... Yeah.

164
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,265
Congratulations.

165
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,400
Six years and I finally get this guy to commit.

166
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,406
This is the one.

167
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,383
Sammy was telling pretty good jokes today.

168
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,147
What do you call 100 faggots
at the bottom of the ocean?

169
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,855
A good start.

170
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,290
How do you save a faggot from drowning?

171
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,797
Take your foot off his head. Oh, shit.

172
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,431
Come on, man, what's up?

173
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,605
You just shut the fuck up, all right?

174
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,836
- What's your problem?
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

175
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,537
I don't like to hear the word "faggot."

176
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,706
- All right? It makes me sick to my stomach.
- Well, you tell him.

177
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,113
Makes me want to fucking puke,

178
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,412
- so just shut up.
- Jesus Christ!

179
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,655

are the head injuries that he's received.

397

He has a large fracture on the back
of his skull

398
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,375
that's causing fluid to build up on his brain.

from this fluid will subside soon,

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,368
Hey, honey.

535
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,369
I'm sorry that I've been such an ass

536
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,338
about the whole wedding thing.

537
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,040
I don't know what's the matter with me.

538
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,178
I know it's important to you.

539
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,049
I know.

540
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,355
And you know what?

541
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,487
I do want to start a family.

542
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,967
And I swear that I won't be so uptight
from now on.

543
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,042
That alone should be worth
waking up for, right?

544
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,880
For those of you who don't know,

545
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,517
Trey McCoy was attacked a few days ago
and is recovering in hospital.

546
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,956
I've spoken to his dad

547
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,362
and he wants you all to know how much

548
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,435
he and his family greatly appreciate
the support

549
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,595
they've received from all of you.

550
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,563
<i>I would ask that you continue</i>

551
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,698
<i>to keep Trey in your prayers and thoughts</i>

552
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,401
<i>while he's in recovery.</i>

553
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,703
<i>We will begin today's service with a prayer.</i>

554
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,710
<i>Father, we ask that we may find comfort</i>

555
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,757
<i>in every sorrow and may see</i>
<i>our way through darkness into light.</i>

556
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,719
Sin is the ruin and misery

557
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,320
of the human soul.

558
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,593
It is destructive in its nature

559
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,067
and God has declared

560
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,333
through many scriptures

561
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,200
that he will punish the unrepentant sinner.

562
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,078
And they should be cast down
into the fires of hell,

563
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,148
because they not only hate God,

564
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,248
they shame him and they do not fear him.

565
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,617
God is love

566
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,386
and religion is the law of love.

567
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,625
REVEREND TIM: <i>When a soul</i>
<i>becomes filled with the love of God,</i>

568
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,757
<i>with a desire for all that is good,</i>

569
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,702
<i>it's become possessed</i>
<i>of a new hold on existence.</i>

570
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,569
<i>There are dark clouds of God's wrath</i>

571
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,974
hanging directly over your heads,

572
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,771
full of the dreadful storm,

573
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,045
and the screaming of thunder,
and were it not for God's restraining hand,

574
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,916
it would immediately burst forth upon you.

575
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,980
You are in God's hands,

576
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,055
and it is uncertain what he will do with you.

577
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,123
No situation in life is hopeless.

578
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,197
<i>Winter has its bright spots,</i>
<i>sickness its comforts,</i>

579
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:25,064
<i>and the sharpest affliction, some solace.</i>

580
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,304
<i>Where there is nothing else, there is hope.</i>

581
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,774
<i>Whatever is good is given to all.</i>

582
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,212
<i>The sun shines for all.</i>

583
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,787
<i>Let us not forget what God explicitly tells us,</i>

584
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,726
and that is to love thy neighbor as thyself.

585
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,221
Sinners! You have despised
the mighty power of God.

586
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,733
Consider the danger that you are in.

587
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,867
<i>It is a great furnace,</i>

588
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,767
<i>a wide and bottomless pit,</i>

589
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,902
<i>full of fire and brimstone,</i>
<i>that you are held over.</i>

590
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,704
Trust in the good of mankind

591
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,310
and in the beauty of God.

592
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,119
The wrath of God!

593
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,380
Acceptance.

594
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,881
Abomination!

595
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,554
God is love.

596
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,593
And He will punish you!

597
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,485
(MUFFLED GROANING)

598
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,998
Trey. Trey? Trey!

599
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,605
Help! Somebody help, please!

600
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,301
- Trey! Oh, please!
- NURSE: I need assistance over here in 2.

601
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,172
- Please!
- Please, ma'am,

602
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,745
can I get you just to stand back a little bit?

603
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,040
Thank you.

604
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,244
We did everything we could.

605
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,323
He had a severe hemorrhage,

606
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,229
and we were not able to stop the bleeding.

607
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,993
I'm very sorry, he passed away.

608
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,227
No!

609
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,841
Mom, Trey didn't make it.

610
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,178
No, I don't really want to talk about it, but...

611
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,623
I'm at the hospital...

612
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,852
No, don't...

613
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,295
Just...

614
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,557
Just take your time.

615
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,735
And come tomorrow.

616
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,703
No, I'm... l'm fine. Bye.

<i>This is Carla with First Class Weddings.</i>

619
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,959
<i>Wanted to let you know we got</i>
<i>your invitations in early,</i>

620
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,331

621
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,131
<i>Okay, thanks a lot...</i>

622
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,973
Mommy, I had a bad dream.

623
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,025
Shh, it's okay.

624
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,653
<i>It's okay, Mommy's here.</i>

625
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,624
<i>Mommy's here.</i>

626
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,346
Where did you get this?

627
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,974
"God Hates Homos."

628
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,143
What?

629
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,015
It's a website.

630
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,549
Amazing.

631
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,917
So, did you find anything else?

632
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,190
The case is being transferred to Homicide.

633
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,556
Homicide.

634
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,661
Yes, but does that mean you're not
on the case or...

635
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,632
No, I am.

636
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,930
But I'll be working with Sergeant Esposito
from Homicide.

637
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,265
He's been around a long time. He's good.

638
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,809
Okay, so what happens now?

639
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,244
The investigation continues
just as it has been.

640
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,617
I know you're frustrated.

641
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,653
Frustrated?
Come on, that asshole should be in jail.

642
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:08,357
Just sit tight, Robbie,
and we'll find something.

643
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,359
We will.

644
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,887
<i>Screw the justice system,</i>

645
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,361
'cause otherwise it's gonna screw you.

646
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,796
That's pretty cynical.

647
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,531
Yeah, well...

648
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,271
I've been around a long time,
and I've seen a lot of crap.

649
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,607
And believe you me,
it ain't never about justice.

650
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,841
I know that for sure.

651
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:38,949
What happened?

652
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,583
My second husband happened, that's what.

653
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,664
You never told me you had
a second husband.

654
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,029
Yeah, well it's not a subject
I really like to bring up.

655
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,897
I'm not real proud of it.

656
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,172
What did he do?

657
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:05,806
Well, first off, he liked to beat
the shit out of me.

658
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,445
Oh, honey.

659
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,180
But I didn't know it till after
I married the son of a bitch.

660
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,949
But, the point is...

661
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,189
Do you think that the law was there
to protect me?

662
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,794
Do you?

663
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,021
Because you think again.

664
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,563
I had to protect myself from him and the law.

665
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,805
Now, you listen to me, Robbie.

666
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,934
You hear what I'm gonna tell you.

667
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:39,048
You cannot rely on anybody but yourself,

668
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,016

- You leave me alone.

Let me ask you a question.
Did God tell you to do it, huh?

Did it make you feel powerful?

711
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,973
It seems like you guys
are dragging your feet.

712
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,569
Is that so?

713
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,816
I noticed in the original report

714
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,353
that you and Mr. McCoy had an argument
just before the incident.

715
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,685
- What are you talking about?
- I just wanna know what happened.

716
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,315
We had a disagreement.

717
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,757
What about?

718
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,054
Why does that matter?

719
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,630
- Did you two fight a lot?
- No.

720
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,995
What do all these questions have to do
with my next door neighbor?

721
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,797
Well, your neighbor tells me he saw
you and Mr. McCoy fight quite a bit.

722
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:21,996
And you believe him?

723
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,471
He also tells me you've been harassing him.

724
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,337
He killed my partner.

725
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,035
He and two other people
say he couldn't have.

726
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,168
They're lying.

727
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,874
Well, why would a respected Pastor,
a man of God, lie to the police?

728
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,477
To protect his son.

729
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,246
A word of advice, stay away from Chris Boyd.

730
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,354
He's been arrested for gay-bashing,
for Christ's sake.

731
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,152
All I know is what the evidence tells me.

732
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,293
And your fingerprints were the only ones
on that bat.

733
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,894
I explained that.

734
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:52,132
Mr. Levinson, you want to tell me
about the life insurance policy?

735
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,965
We both had one on each other.

736
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,768
Did you kill your boyfriend?

737
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,610
This isn't happening.

738
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,578
It's a simple question.

739
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,279
Get out of my house.

740
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,099
"And gave us the day and the night,

741
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,396
"and God made the sky above,

742
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,338
"and God made the water below."

743
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,906
Where's Chris Boyd?

744
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,941
Check the activity room.

745
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,943
- You're interrupting a meeting.
- What did you tell them?

746
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,783
- ALTON: Back off!
- You're a liar!

747
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,016
Back off!

748
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,821
WOMAN: Yes, we need help.

749
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,360
- What's going on here?
- Kathleen, call Stella!

750
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,595
Where you taking him and why?

751
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,966
Well, well, well, Ms. Slansky.

752
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,398
Nice to see you again, Kathleen.

753
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,771
Mr. Esposito.

754
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,981
Committing another act of justice, I see.

755
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,880
Now, I figured I'd run into you
again eventually.

756
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,419
Now you stay on the right side
of the law this time,

757
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,785
otherwise I'll be taking you down, too.

758
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,424
Your boy here's been arrested for assault.

759
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,021
You leave him alone, you mother...

760
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,005
She been coaching you, son?

761
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,813
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

762
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,384
I don't want to sit.

763
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,643
Close the door and sit down.

764
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,490
You could have told me

765
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,789
that you were questioning Robbie Levinson
as a suspect.

766
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,488
When you've been doing this as long as
I have...

767
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,690
He didn't do it.

768
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,391
Are you familiar with this case?

769
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,333
You mean my case? Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

770
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,065
Well, then you know that his fingerprints
are all over the murder weapon,

771
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,664
which just happened to belong to the victim.

772
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,671
He was covered in the victim's blood,

773
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,210
and to top it all off, he's about to collect

774
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,802
half a million dollars in life insurance.

775
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,472
I mean, what am I missing here?

776
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,779
The whole goddamn story. And Chris Boyd.

777
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,718
Oh, yes, right, Chris Boyd is lying.
Show me the proof.

778
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,722
Kathleen Slansky's statement.

779
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,682
Oh, come on.

780
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,587
About that.

781
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,421
You do me a favor,
you ask that old broad about her husband,

782
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,225
her dead husband.

783
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,425
I mean, look at the facts, Fisher.

784
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,031
You cannot just ignore Boyd's past.

785
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,868
Oh, all too convenient for Levinson,
wouldn't you think?

786
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,568
Just because a man has had run-ins
with homos...

787
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,469
Homosexuals, doesn't mean he's a killer.

788
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,047
Yeah, well neither does being a homo.

789
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,049
Look, it looks like
an open and shut case to me.

790
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,119
I've already talked to the DA about
making a case.

791
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,619
You did what?

792
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,686
You are not going to just shut me out of this.

793
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,489
This is Homicide, Fisher.
Stick to something you can handle.

794
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,557
Robbie, what is wrong with you?

795
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,828
They're putting a restraining order
out on me.

796
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,062
- What?
- Yeah, to stay away from him.

797
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,496
I should have seen this coming.

798
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,541
This isn't like you.

799
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,935
Hey, promise me
you won't do something like this again.

800
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,878
He's lying to the police.

801
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:28,944
Robbie.

802
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,857
Hey. You should get some rest.

803
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,022
I'm fine.

804
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,929
- Fine? You haven't slept for days.
- You noticed?

805
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,593
I'm sorry.

806
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,836

I can't pretend that everything's
back to normal.

809
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,475
My life will never be normal again.

810
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:01,476
Not like me?

811
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,419
What, you think my life is all of a sudden
back to normal?

812
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,887
You know, how am I supposed to know, Jim?

813
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,289
You never talk to me about your hurt.
You never say anything to me.

814
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,728
At least, when you were a mean drunk, you...

815
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,131
You told me how you were feeling,
you know?

816
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,637
You know, just forget it.

817
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,342
Excuse me.

818
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,574
So, apparently this is about me.

819
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,150
Have I done something that I'm unaware of?

820
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,345
You're treating me like the enemy.

822
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,957

- No, let's not just drop it.

happening here.

- I don't want your help!

You can't help me.

Please, I'm just trying to do the laundry.

828
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,101
- Let me do something.
- Oh, please, just leave me alone.

- Stop!

- Yes.

- You want to know what you can do for me?
- Try me.

contact information for Sammy.

842

- Can you give me that?
- Yeah.

843
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,547
You ever been in trouble
with the law before, Alton?

844
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,625
Nope. Never.

845
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,827
Never? Hmm.

- Oh.

What? It wasn't me, okay?

849
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,668
- Isn't it obvious who did it?
- Who?

850
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,007
Chris.

No.

So to save your own ass,
you're saying he did it.

854
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,096
Yeah, no. No, I didn't mean...

855
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,134
Look, he wouldn't tell me
where he'd been that night.

FISHER: He wasn't at home
because he was at his parents'.

- You called his mother?
- Yeah. She said he wasn't there.

884
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,571
My son is a...

885
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,607
He's a decent, kind, God-fearing young man.

886
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,141
Oh, really.

887
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,173
My son is dead.

888
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,240
I know.

889
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,815
I know what you must be going through.

890
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,114
Tell you what,

891
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,919
Christopher has done
some pretty foolish things in his life,

892
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,554
especially when he was a little boy.

893
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,822
By God's grace,
he's always been able to stay on track.

894
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:20,060
But every time he would get into trouble,

895
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,364
I couldn't help but feel that, somehow,

896
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,939
I had failed as a mother.

897
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:30,774
I really do hope that
you don't blame yourself

898
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,870
for the choices your son made.

899
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,782
Excuse me? Choices?

900
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,617
Well, you know what I mean.

901
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,485
By living his life the way he did,

902
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,558
surely you understand that he was a target.

903
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:52,427
Get out.

904
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,795
Get out!

905
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,294
(SOBBING)

906
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,512
Sit down, Christopher.

907
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,160
You live your life in spite of me, boy?

908
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,539
Hmm?

909
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:07,467
Answer me.

910
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,045
What do you want me to say?

911
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,310
What is wrong with you?

912
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,588
You mind telling me what this is all about?

913
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,797
Hmm?

914
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,097
That's not me.

915
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,465
How about that one?

916
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,474
Hmm?

917
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,812
That's not me. Are you having me followed?

918
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,745
- What were you doing in that evil place?
- Nothing.

919
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,511
What were you doing in there, son?
You tell me.

920
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,981
That filthy, sinning faggot

921
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,681
came on to me!

922
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,655
And I told him to get out of my face.

923
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,158
And he wouldn't leave me alone,

924
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,390
and he wouldn't listen to me,
and it was disgusting.

925
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,524
What were you doing in there
in the first place?

926
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,329
- I got lost.
- You liar!

927
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,267
Now how about this time, this time,

928
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,204
and the time before that,
and the time before that?

929
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,081
You'll not humiliate me any longer.

930
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,283
Now, you will not betray God.

931
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,283
What have I done to deserve
such defiance from you, son?

932
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,588
I didn't do anything wrong.

933
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,328
I told him he was gonna go to hell.

934
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,294
I told him to read the Bible.

935
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,802
It was those fags that live next door,
wasn't it, those boys over there?

936
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:44,873
Huh?

937
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,065
I seen you with them.

938
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:53,103
They tried to recruit you?
Is that what happened?

939
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,713
You wouldn't do that on your own.
Not my son.

940
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,984
They got to you, didn't they?

941
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,852
I was too late.

942
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:15,430
Too late?

943
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,161
I was too late.

944
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,203
You did it.

945
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,404
Didn't you?

946
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,280
You know what God does to those
said to be beyond repentance.

947
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,579
CHRIS: You killed that boy next door?

948
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,819
PASTOR BOYD: I wasn't gonna let them
take my own flesh and blood.

949
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,791
Now this disgusting filth has got to end.

950
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,858
In the name of God, it has got to stop,

951
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,935
and if somebody doesn't do something,

952
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:50,801
this plague is going to infest
the entire country.

953
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,766
Come back to God, son.

954
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,242
You're sick.

955
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,545
Come back to God, son.

956
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,416
PASTOR BOYD: Christopher.

957

MARTHA: Chris?

958
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,647
Is that you? I thought I heard you come in.

959
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,217
Is something wrong?

960
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,054
Why do you put up with him?

961
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,161
What are you talking about?

962
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,608
You should've gotten out
when you had the chance.

963
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,148

- Their church.

I see.
And you, what do you know about this?

990
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,379
I know it proves he killed my son.

991
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,013
Were you there when it was recorded?

992
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,113
No.

993
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:02,188
You have the confession, all right,
so what happens now?

994
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,228
Confession? Confession for what?

Are you an idiot? I mean, it's right there!

996

No, I didn't hear anyone confess to anything.

it is who he says it is.

you're in more trouble than you're already in.

1002
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,642
- Why, 'cause I got the truth?
- Because you broke the law.

1003

You can't just record people
without them knowing it.

1004
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:25,185
You could get 20 years alone just for this.

He told me.
