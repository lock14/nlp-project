rude to Ralph?

363
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,732
Who gives a shit
about your friend, Ralph?

364
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,999
Hey!

365
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,170
I do.
What's your problem?

366
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,704
You know what?
Forget it.

367
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,640
I said I was gonna help
Randy with his homework.

368
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,650
Wilson, wait.

369
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,865
Listen, you've
never questioned

370
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,570
my integrity before.

371
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,150
And you know
what I'm about.

372
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,470
If you have something
to say to me, Son,

373
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,495
then just...

374
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,599
Then say it.

375
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,631
You know what?

376
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,641
What?

377
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,010
What?

378
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,546
ANA: So what do you know
about your father?

379
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,881
Nothing to talk about there.

380
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,483
I was ten when my
grandmother died,

381
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,452
and after that
my mom shut down,

382
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,153
and she went man-crazy.

383
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,656
Can't blame her for that.

384
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,131
I'm not blaming her for that.

385
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,392
You're judging her.

386
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,190
I'm not judging her,
I'm just saying it's

387
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,361
irresponsible, that's all.

388
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,597
What are you
talking about, Wilson?

389
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:35,964
Forget it.

390
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,833
I don't even want to
get into it. It's just...

391
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,033
Shutting down is
not gonna help.

392
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,043
I'm not shutting down.

393
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,877
I'm not gonna
let you get me into this

394
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:44,773
back-and-forth stuff.

395
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:45,907
What back-and-forth stuff?

396
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,074
What?
What back-and-forth stuff?

397
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:48,275
How we going
back and forth?

398
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:50,285
This.

399
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:54,022
I need a break.

400
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,721
Look.

401
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,690
The last relationship
my mom had,

402
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,893
Randy was produced,
and the man disappeared.

403
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,961
And?

404
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,031
And I love my brother
more than anything

405
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:08,830
on this planet.

406
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,297
And she is getting older.

407
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:11,700
She should slow down a bit.

408
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,802
She don't need to do
this in front of Randy.

409
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,202
Do what?
You know what

410
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,403
I'm talking about.

411
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:17,639
You want her to be alone?

412
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,875
She's not gonna be alone,
because she has me and Randy.

413
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,942
You're being silly.

414
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,878
You know what?
I don't give a shit anyway.

415
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,044
I'm 21 years old.

416
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,179
I want to have my own place.

417
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:27,349
I want to move out.
I don't want to be

418
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,583
in the house no more.

419
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,417
Really?

420
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,427
Why you smiling?

421
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,822
I don't know.

422
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,557
You're not ready
to live with me.

423
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,758
Your father would kill us.

424
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,125
And what is with
your father, anyway?

425
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,226
What are you talking about?

426
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,095
Well, it's the way
he looks at me.

427
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,831
It's like he's ready to
kill somebody, like...

428
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,833
He's got these eyebrows.
They're like werewolves.

429
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,801
Don't use my father
as an excuse.

430
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,021
Anyway...
I'm a good woman.

431
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:50,271
Yeah.
Yeah.

432
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,605
This is true.

433
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:53,574
You don't know
what you're missing.

434
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:55,509
Anyway, my daddy's
like a teddy bear.

435
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,519
Oh, yeah?

436
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,347
ANA: You trying to get
me on the hood again?

437
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,357
MAN: Ana!

438
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,152
How you doing, sir?

439
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:07,162
Hi, Daddy.

440
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,523
Enjoy the orange.

441
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:10,926
Wilson.

442
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,560
Werewolf.
Stop.

443
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm telling you.

444
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,908
Goes for the shot.

445
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:20,669
Ice cream?

446
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,571
Yep.

447
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,273
Randy, I thought I told you
to leave the ball in the car.

448
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:27,441
They'll steal it.

449
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:30,171
Nobody's going
to steal anything.

450
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:33,095
Stop bouncing this ball.

451
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,592
Okay.
Okay.

452
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,263
All right. Come on.

453
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,291
Don't bounce it.

454
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,936
Don't bounce...
Don't bounce it!

455
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,734
He bounces it high!

456
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,870
You wanna keep
bouncing the ball, huh?

457
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,172
RANDY: Keep bouncing it,
keep bouncing it.

458
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,412
He goes for the shot!
But he misses it!

459
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,956
He shoots it!

460
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,629
He gets the rebound!

461
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,759
Another shot!

462
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,999
Randy. Come here, sweetie.

463
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,140
Sweetheart,
stay close to me.

464
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,501
You want chicken tonight?

465
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,103
RANDY: No. Pizza.

466
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,113
No.

467
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,373
Chicken.

468
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:36,038
WOMAN: Let me get a pound
of salami, please.

469
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,091
Randy.

470
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,133
Okay.

471
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:02,033
Come here, Randy.
Stay close to me.

472
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,612
Stay real close,
okay, baby?

473
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,784
Please, baby.

474
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,544
Stop bouncing the ball.

475
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,113
I told you. Please!
Stop bouncing the ball!

476
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:14,314
Shit.

477
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:16,324
Excuse me.
Millie.

478
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,896
I thought that was you.

479
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:22,957
It's me, Wanda.
From the Bronx. Willis Ave.

480
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,800
Wanda, wow.
It's been a while.

481
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,673
Is he yours?

482
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,099
I'm Randy.

483
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,109
Oh, how adorable.

484
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:39,031
Oh, but this isn't
compay Wilson's, right?

485
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,217
Wilson's dead.

486
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,887
We gotta go.

487
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,923
It's good to see you.

488
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:49,349
I didn't know you were
in Connecticut now.

489
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,759
You know, you should
give me your number.

490
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,657
Sure.

491
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,132
Give it to me.
I'll log it in.

492
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:06,366
Here we go.

493
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:07,969
It's good to see you.

494
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,036
Take care.

495
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,939
Yeah, you too.

496
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,539
Let's go.

497
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:13,975
We didn't get my cereal.

498
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,242
We'll get it later,
sweetheart,

499
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:18,992
just stand in front of
me and watch the cart.

500
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,813
ANA: What you know
about this, Wil?

501
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:28,623
WILSON: It's an old joint.

502
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,357
It's a classic right here.

503
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,159
I wanna see you get busy.

504
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,804
(REGGAETON PLAYING
ON CAR RADIO)

505
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,201
How's that
doing for you, baby?

506
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,786
You see, like that.
Come on, you do it.

507
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,687
No, you do it
better than me.

508
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,155
Come on.

509
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,422
That's all you right there.

510
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:03,658
You're so cute.

511
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,898
I like it when you smile.

512
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,065
ANA: So what, did you speak
to your math professor?

513
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:13,367
WILSON:
Yeah, I spoke to him.

514
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,501
What did he say?

515
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:15,737
What he always says.

516
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,905
What did he say?

517
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,400
''No exceptions.''
Meanwhile, I got a 4.O.

518
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,189
4.O. 4.O's I get in the class
and he gives me attitude.

519
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,958
Don't listen to him.

520
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,091
What are you doing?

521
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,794
Mom says we're moving.

522
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:40,962
What are you
talking about?

523
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,953
MILLIE: Randy, sweetie,
can you come upstairs and get

524
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:43,798
the rest of your toys?

525
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,418
Fine.
Good, I'm glad

526
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,443
you're here.

527
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,519
Can you help me
with some of this?

528
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,975
So,

529
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,276
we're not taking any
heavy stuff right now.

530
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,178
You're kidding me, right?
Does it look like it?

531
00:30:58,188 --> 00:30:59,513
I'm not going anywhere, Ma.

532
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,715
Wilson, no. Uh-uh.

533
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,049
I don't have time
for this right now.

534
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,151
Make time!
What did you say?

535
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:05,452
This has become
a thing for you now, right?

536
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,721
Is that what this is?

537
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,623
Every couple of years
we move to a new town?

538
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,757
What is it, Mom?

539
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,795
The dates dry out?
There's no more

540
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,458
men to fuck around...

541
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,593
Hey!

542
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:13,828
Maybe I should go.

543
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,995
No, no, no.
That's okay.

544
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:17,725
Stay right there.
You, come here.

545
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,824
You may be 21,
but don't you ever dare

546
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:22,804
talk to me like that.

547
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,739
I'm not 14 anymore, Mom!

548
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,187
I know that, Wilson!
Okay? Let's get it

549
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:26,875
through your head!

550
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,208
I'm not 14 anymore.

551
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,444
I'm not gonna move
for some phantom reason

552
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:32,279
that you can never
fully explain to me.

553
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,014
Okay, listen to me Wilson!

554
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:36,561
Till this day, Son,
you've never

555
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:38,452
needed anything, right?

556
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:39,620
Right?

557
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,121
Yeah, so?
Yeah, so!

558
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,591
So right now you
need to listen to me!

559
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,192
And go get some of
your things together.

560
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:46,360
You're absolutely right.

561
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,196
Till this day I never
needed anything.

562
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:51,098
But you have to
give me something, Mom.

563
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:53,658
Because I'm not
going anywhere.

564
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,675
You're a man already.

565
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:07,455
Fine.

566
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,059
Come with me.

567
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,461
I'm gonna go.
No. Stay.

568
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,990
Because we might end up
living together

569
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
sooner than you think.

570
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,009
I've been trying to crack
that safe since I was 14.

571
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,477
I know.

572
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:38,880
Combination's your birthday.

573
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,930
Oh, I should have known!

574
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,836
Do you wanna know
about your father?

575
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,862
You wanna know?
Or what?

576
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,939
Because if you don't,
it ends right here.

577
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,946
Fine.

578
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,676
Let's go back upstairs
and do what we have to do.

579
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,686
I wanna know.

580
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:13,088
I wanna know.

581
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:16,851
Fine.

582
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,552
I've always been
straight with you, Wilson,

583
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:20,562
I'm not gonna stop now.

584
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,064
Your father,

585
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,315
he was a drug dealer,
Wilson.

586
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,330
Great. So, you're telling me
he was a fucking loser.

587
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Is that what it is?

588
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:36,303
That loser was my husband.

589
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:38,205
And it's gonna take
you about 20 more years

590
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:40,608
to become half the man
that he was at your age.

591
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,728
Don't you ever talk
about your father like

592
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:43,610
that to me again.

593
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,979
This is fucking bullshit,
Mom.

594
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,082
Get the fuck over here!

595
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,762
Come here.

596
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:54,789
Hey.

597
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,923
MILLIE: This is
some serious shit

598
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,464
and I need you
to step outside of

599
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:58,525
yourself for a minute.

600
00:33:58,535 --> 00:33:59,794
And be a man.

601
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,862
I am a man.
Fine.

602
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,660
Then all I'm asking
you to do right now,

603
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,631
Wilson, is to listen.

604
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,106
No heavy lifting,
just listen.

605
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,567
Like a real man.

606
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:10,127
Come on,
you can have that one.

607
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,422
Go ahead. I'm listening.

608
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:18,053
Now, your father, he...

609
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,707
He got himself into
some deep trouble

610
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:22,683
with some people.

611
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,551
20 years ago?
Are you gonna listen?

612
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,561
Go ahead.

613
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,221
Three times they came at me.

614
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:31,716
One time when you were
just a little baby.

615
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,529
And then again when
you were Randy's age,

616
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,229
and then yet again
when you were 14.

617
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,397
How come I don't
remember any of this?

618
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:41,232
Because I have always
done what I'm doing now.

619
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,705
You know what?

620
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,606
Now you gotta
listen to me, Mom.

621
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:47,809
Okay?

622
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,010
I'm not leaving everything
that I have here.

623
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,613
I'm not leaving Ana.
I'm not leaving school.

624
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,714
Nothing.

625
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,124
For some Tony Montana
that doesn't exist.

626
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,587
Tony Montana shit
that doesn't exist, huh?

627
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,637
Why don't you feel that?

628
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,890
Stop.
Do you feel it?

629
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,759
Mom.
No. Do you feel it?

630
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,769
Stop! Stop!

631
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:08,462
Where did you get that?

632
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,702
Where did you get
the fucking gun, Mom?

633
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:20,240
Mom?

634
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,075
What is all that?

635
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,678
It's called weight, Son.

636
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:24,879
Mom.

637
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,046
Yeah. Listen.

638
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,735
I'm taking Randy
because I have

639
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:28,582
to protect him.

640
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,183
Protect him from what, Mom?

641
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:31,410
Because we've
been spotted, Son.

642
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,519
That's all you need to know.

643
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,529
Been spotted by who?

644
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,157
Okay. Okay.

645
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,731
Randy and I are leaving.

646
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,808
You coming?

647
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,024
My God, you're not coming.

648
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,969
If you're your father's son,
you'll defend yourself.

649
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,065
You won't let
anything happen to you.

650
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,167
Doesn't make sense, Mom.

651
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,577
It was 20 years ago, right?

652
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,854
Okay.

653
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,590
You're good.

654
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,272
Mommy says
you're not coming.

655
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,828
Not right now.

656
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:41,622
You don't love me?

657
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,523
We're not partners?

658
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,743
We will always
be partners.

659
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,069
Always.

660
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,866
Come here.

661
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,668
I love you.
I love you, too.

662
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,202
Okay, good.

663
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,212
Give me some.

664
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,608
You're the man.

665
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,856
I'll call you later,
all right?

666
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:02,275
All right.

667
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:04,244
Be a good boy.

668
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,254
Listen to Mommy.

669
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,022
You okay, baby?

670
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,558
I love you, Mommy.

671
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,568
I love you too, baby.

672
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,811
I got it.

673
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,207
Take care of him?

674
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,217
Mmm-hmm.

675
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,791
Son.

676
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,033
I'm sorry.

677
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,865
ANA: Dominos?

678
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,893
What?
This is real numbers here.

679
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,695
Okay.

680
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,129
Babe, pizza again?

681
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:37,865
I never said I could cook.

682
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,299
That's a lie.

683
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:43,304
This one's different,
they put pineapples in it.

684
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,679
It's been a few days, babe.

685
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,712
Your mom's fine.

686
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,380
She'd have been fine here.

687
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,390
Whatever.

688
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,893
Fine.

689
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,696
What are you gonna do?

690
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,644
I don't wanna talk
about it right now.

691
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,870
Okay.

692
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,507
Done.

693
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:15,176
You want more?

694
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:17,170
No, I'm good.

695
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
I'll drink from yours.

696
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,975
Oh my God, babe,
you just missed it!

697
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,194
WILSON: What happened?
Who's ahead?

698
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,942
What did I miss?

699
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:58,486
Baby, do me a favor.

700
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,682
Bring the plates to
the kitchen, we're done.

701
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:05,184
Ay, bendito,
you miss your mom.

702
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:09,096
Please?

703
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,467
Give me a kiss.

704
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:41,237
Baby.
I like this.

705
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:42,288
You have candles?

706
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:45,161
Baby, I want you to go
downstairs to the basement,

707
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:45,693
I want...

708
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,360
(DOORBELL RINGS)

709
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,995
Who's that?
What are you talking about?

710
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:50,363
You're scaring me, Wilson.

711
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,373
Please. Go now.

712
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,170
ANA: Knives?

713
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,639
What is it?

714
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:34,649
Be quiet.

715
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,552
Go! Go! Come on!

716
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,084
WILSON:
They're here to kill us.

717
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:39,880
ANA: What's going on?

718
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,188
Keep it down, baby.

719
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:43,550
What's going on?

720
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,418
Keep it down.

721
00:42:45,428 --> 00:42:47,153
How'd they get in so easily?

722
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,163
How'd they get in?

723
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:51,291
I thought
the door was locked.

724
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:54,494
I left the door unlocked
when I got the pizza.

725
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:55,763
Damn, babe.

726
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,773
Shit.

727
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:04,478
(GUN FIRING)

728
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:07,828
Why are they shooting at us?

729
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,544
We're okay, we're okay.
Stay there, okay?

730
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:12,782
Yeah, I'm staying here.
But why are

731
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:13,513
they shooting at us?

732
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:14,982
I don't know, babe.

733
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,316
They looking for you?

734
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,818
No, they're looking
for my mom.

735
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,828
I think.

736
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:22,098
My birthday,
my birthday,

737
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:23,463
come on. Please.

738
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

739
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:31,072
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

740
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:35,836
ANA: Wilson, you need to
do something, let's go!

741
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,070
Wilson,
what are you looking for?

742
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
WILSON: 1985.

743
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,809
What are you looking for?

744
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,409
I can't believe this.

745
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:44,577
You got this, Wilson.

746
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:45,879
Shit, you have a gun?

747
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,445
You got this. Yeah.
Where'd you get

748
00:43:47,455 --> 00:43:48,047
the gun from?

749
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:50,057
Mom.

750
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:51,986
Miss DeLeon gave you a gun?

751
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,186
Yeah.

752
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,196
Oh, shit.

753
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,094
Why are they
looking for you, Wilson?

754
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:02,428
Babe, relax! Okay?

755
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:05,073
Relax?
Someone's shooting at us.

756
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,402
What are you
doing with a gun?

757
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:11,412
Please, okay? Please.

758
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:16,435
Shit! I think they're coming.
What the fuck is

759
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,715
going on, babe?

760
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,351
Get back under the stairs.

761
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,361
Okay, okay.

762
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
(ANA SCREAMING)

763
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,405
Get the gun!

764
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,268
WILSON: Stay there, okay?

765
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:44,278
Wait! Where you going?

766
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,441
Ana, stay there.

767
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:49,977
Don't move. Please.

768
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,367
I don't think you should go.

769
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,328
Come on!

770
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,436
Put the gun down.

771
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,593
Fuck.

772
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,899
Come here. I love you.

773
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,126
I love you, too.

774
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:22,136
It's all right.

775
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,996
MILLIE: How's Ana?

776
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,264
WILSON: fine.

777
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:28,674
Well, as fine as she
can be, considering.

778
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:31,340
What's this all about, Mom?

779
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,307
Over 20 years ago, right?

780
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:37,410
Mom,
why is this beef with you?

781
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,225
Because to them
I'm just a policy.

782
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,105
I know who they are, Wilson.

783
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:47,504
They murdered your father.

784
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,288
And while I'm still alive,

785
00:47:49,298 --> 00:47:51,557
no one feels safe,
as far as they're concerned.

786
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:52,926
''They''?

787
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,841
Well, you know,
I say ''they'', but not really.

788
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:57,441
It's...

789
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,365
It's one guy.
Who?

790
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,200
A guy.

791
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,210
Who?

792
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,007
His name is Javier Cordero.
He lives in Puerto Rico.

793
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:10,822
When's the last time
you seen him?

794
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:13,153
20 years ago.

795
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,448
You know,
I don't want to talk

796
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,718
about this anymore.

797
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,318
You look tired.

798
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:20,921
Mom, there's ways to deal
with this kind of thing.

799
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,421
No, you need to get to bed.

800
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:23,624
Listen to me.

801
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,766
I'm not getting
into this with you

802
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,391
right now, Wilson.

803
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:26,559
There's Witness
Protection Program.

804
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:29,624
Enough, already!
Don't you think I've

805
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:31,244
tried that, Wilson?

806
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,639
There is no
Witness Protection

807
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:34,835
Program for us.

808
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,323
We're not very high
on their

809
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,536
priority list, Wilson.

810
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:38,772
You know how
much the government

811
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,792
is willing to
spend to relocate us

812
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:42,141
and keep us on the DL?

813
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:43,922
You, me and Randy
are not worth

814
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:45,111
the expense to them,

815
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,246
because they told me
all they'll have

816
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:49,750
is a small-time
gangster named Cordero.

817
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,390
Now, why don't you
download that

818
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,755
into your brain?

819
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:04,712
We're alone on this one.

820
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,643
There will be no help.

821
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,805
And the sooner
you realize that,

822
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,785
the sooner you're gonna
help me keep

823
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:16,320
this family alive.

824
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,921
ANA: Miss DeLeon,
can I ask you something?

825
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,931
That depends.

826
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:32,066
On what?

827
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,695
On how long you plan
to stick around.

828
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,663
Hey, I'm here.

829
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,230
I love Wilson, Miss DeLeon.

830
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,298
I know you do, Ana.
That's not what

831
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:41,334
I'm referring to.

832
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,970
I know what
you're referring to.

833
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,266
And if he was someone else,
I would have been

834
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:47,841
gone a long time ago.

835
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,676
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

836
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,378
And I don't know
if I want to know.

837
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:54,580
Ana, what I think
you should know

838
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,750
is that when
you love someone,

839
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,853
their journey becomes yours,
just as much as theirs.

840
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,755
Yeah.

841
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,995
Miss DeLeon,
no disrespect,

842
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,956
but what is it
that you wanna know?

843
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,329
You're so young.

844
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:12,002
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

845
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:12,331
I know.

846
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:15,061
Why do you want
to complicate it?

847
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,999
Maybe this isn't
the right time

848
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:19,238
for you to commit.

849
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:22,441
I don't... I don't
have the answer you want.

850
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:23,906
And I don't know how
far I'm willing to go

851
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:24,410
with all this.

852
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,312
The only thing I'm sure of is

853
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:29,127
that I'm not going
anywhere today.

854
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:32,259
Okay.

855
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:35,596
RANDY: Got you!

856
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,157
In!

857
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,092
Go get it.

858
00:50:40,102 --> 00:50:41,828
RANDY: Why can't
you get it?

859
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,878
Thank you. You know I...

860
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,808
Huh?

861
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:52,279
Right here.

862
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,478
J
Can I have the ball

863
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:55,078
please?

864
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Come on. Come on.

865
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,006
Come on.
Randy, stand behind me.

866
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,632
WILSON: What are you
trying to say?

867
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:30,877
ANA: No!

868
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,078
It's 20 years
it's been happening!

869
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,212
This is my mom
I'm talking about.

870
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,414
This isn't about your mother,
it's about you!

871
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,550
Could you stop?

872
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,919
This isn't a good idea,
Wilson. It's not.

873
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,329
How long am I supposed
to let this go on?

874
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:43,723
It's not up to you.

875
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,990
It is.

876
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,936
It's not...
You saw the look

877
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:46,325
in her eyes

878
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,594
when she saw
that man. Right?

879
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:50,229
We both saw that.

880
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:51,698
Who was he?

881
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,399
Doesn't matter.

882
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:54,533
It does matter!

883
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:55,601
It doesn't matter.

884
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,137
It's like she saw
the Devil himself.

885
00:51:58,147 --> 00:52:00,139
What am I supposed to do?

886
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:02,869
I don't know, baby,
I don't know.

887
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,577
This is the best you
could come up with?

888
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,312
Listen to me!
This is the way, ma.

889
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:08,447
I gotta do this this way.

890
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,049
She's not gonna
tell me anything,

891
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:12,351
so I gotta go over
there and find out.

892
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:14,353
This is
the first time in my life

893
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,363
I look in my mom's eyes

894
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,825
and she don't
know what to do.

895
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,640
And I've never
seen her like that.

896
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:26,302
I gotta do this.
Okay? I gotta do this.

897
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,968
Who do you think you are?

898
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,713
Her son.

899
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,450
Hey, taxi?
Yeah.

900
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,953
Bag? Throw it in.

901
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,454
I'm Solomon!
Welcome to my cab!

902
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:23,623
How you doing?

903
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,186
Talk to you in English
'cause I know you are

904
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:28,929
from New York. Right?

905
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,029

01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,051
Don't talk so fast.

1089
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:28,253
What's wrong?

1090
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:30,259
I'm all right, I...

1091
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:31,589
What happened, Wilson?

1092
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,682
I don't know how
I got back to my hotel

1093
01:09:33,692 --> 01:09:34,292
last night,

1094
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:36,302
but I'm all right.

1095
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,063
What do you mean?

1096
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:40,765
What happened, babe?

1097
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:42,900
When are you coming home?

1098
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,476
Hmm, that's a good one.
Looks like it hurts.

1099
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:55,141
All right, let's see
if you can handle this.

1100
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,090
Oh, yeah. That's right.

1101
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,454
It hurts, right? Okay.

1102
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:05,248
So what did I tell you
about riding your bike

1103
01:10:05,258 --> 01:10:06,357
without a helmet?

1104
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:08,761
Odds go up 50O_ of
me getting hurt?

1105
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,895
That's right.

1106
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,697
No more bike riding for you.

1107
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,464
Never again
in my life? Ever?

1108
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:16,874
Just relax.
Just until you heal up 100O_.

1109
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:26,812
Can I have a sandwich?

1110
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,881
What kind?
Peanut butter and jelly.

1111
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,415
No, we're out of
peanut butter and jelly.

1112
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:33,819
What about a mud, lettuce
and tomato sandwich?

1113
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,453
Just joking.

1114
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:36,722
You're a bad Mom.

1115
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,556
I know.

1116
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:40,191
Come on.
Go upstairs, clean up

1117
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:41,459
and I'll make
you that sandwich.

1118
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:43,469
Gotcha, Mom.

1119
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:48,066
''Thank you, Mom!''

1120
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,076
You're welcome!

1121
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:54,146
Wil!

1122
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,083
Yeah!

1123
01:10:58,052 --> 01:10:59,244
What's up, man?

1124
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,411
What's up?

1125
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:02,881
Look at your face.
It looks just like mine.

1126
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,382
Yeah, what happened to yours?

1127
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:05,550
My bike fell.

1128
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,318
And you were on it, right?
Mmm-hmm.

1129
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:09,053
What happened to yours?

1130
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:11,273
I fell on somebody's fist.

1131
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,891
Must have been a big fist.

1132
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,525
Yeah, it was.

1133
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:16,695
Me and Mommy gotta talk.
Okay.

1134
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,849
So you go upstairs,
you lock the door,

1135
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,131
I'll be up there soon.

1136
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:22,351
Gotcha.
All right, come on.

1137
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:25,273
MILLIE: Hey, look who's back.

1138
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:26,571
Glad you're back.

1139
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,506
You know, Ana called
like three times

1140
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:32,256
and you know something,
she sounded really...

1141
01:11:34,255 --> 01:11:35,413
What happened to you?

1142
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,803
Nothing, I got into a fight.

1143
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,250
Where?

1144
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,585
Doesn't matter, Ma.
Please sit down so...

1145
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:42,186
No, no, I don't wanna sit.

1146
01:11:42,196 --> 01:11:43,989
Just tell me what happened.

1147
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,052
Let me take
a look at that.

1148
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:45,423
Ma, stop.

1149
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,130
Looks bad.
Stop, stop.

1150
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,593
I just wanna talk.

1151
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:50,603
Okay.

1152
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,906
We'll talk.

1153
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,703
I'll listen and
I'll make a sandwich

1154
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,002
for Randy, okay?

1155
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:01,539
How you been putting me
through college, Mom?

1156
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:02,585
You're getting
yourself through

1157
01:12:02,595 --> 01:12:03,041
college, Son.

1158
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:04,509
You're really bright.

1159
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:05,778
Mom, please,
it's important.

1160
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:08,513
All right,
so what are you saying?

1161
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:11,243
How did I pay
for your education?

1162
01:12:11,492 --> 01:12:13,351
Does it matter to you?
Yeah, it does.

1163
01:12:13,361 --> 01:12:14,452
Why?

1164
01:12:14,462 --> 01:12:16,752
Because maybe that's
the reason why this is

1165
01:12:16,762 --> 01:12:17,522
all happening.

1166
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:21,492
You know, I never questioned
why we lived so well.

1167
01:12:21,502 --> 01:12:23,542
Because it's all I knew.

1168
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:25,864
Buy another house.

1169
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,833
No problems,
no questions asked.

1170
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,667
You know, come to
think of it, Mom,

1171
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:33,071
I can't recall the last time
you even had a job.

1172
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,779
Or at least one that
didn't keep you away

1173
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:37,609
from me and Randy too long.

1174
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,619
How'd you do it?

1175
01:12:45,693 --> 01:12:47,988
I wanna show you something.

1176
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:53,257
Have a seat.
You'll learn something.

1177
01:12:53,267 --> 01:12:56,394
Ay, nene, your becoming
a man is getting real tiring.

1178
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:58,404
Okay, so...

1179
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:01,566
Okay, this is it.

1180
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:03,501
What?

1181
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:04,769
What is this?

1182
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:07,205
It's the investments
we own and,

1183
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,808
yeah, some stocks
I bought in the '80s,

1184
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,543
all of which put us
in a position

1185
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,511
never to have to
worry about money.

1186
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:14,580
Is this Microsoft stock?

1187
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,751
Yes, I was so stupid.

1188
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,035
I should have bought more.

1189
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:21,119
Wow.

1190
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:23,655
You had some
serious investments.

1191
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,423
Yeah, I made
some smart choices.

1192
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,960
Okay, so, I did my part.

1193
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:31,799
How'd you get your bruises?

1194
01:13:33,574 --> 01:13:36,544
I went to Puerto Rico
and I met with

1195
01:13:36,554 --> 01:13:37,824
Javier Cordero.

1196
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:41,707
What did you do?

1197
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,842
He told me you took
two million dollars.

1198
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,443
What did you do?
Mom.

1199
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,453
What?
Mom, what's wrong?

1200
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:50,147
Mom. Mom, what's wrong?

1201
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,718
I'm gonna kick your butt.

1202
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,823
Randy! Put on your jacket
and meet me downstairs.

1203
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,833
I mean it. Hurry up!

1204
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,895
Mom. What's wrong?

1205
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,905
What's wrong?

1206
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,733
You got your gun?
No.

1207
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,201
All right, take this.
Why you giving me this?

1208
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:12,388
Because it's not
about the fucking two

1209
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:13,337
million dollars!

1210
01:14:13,347 --> 01:14:14,672
What are you
talking about?

1211
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:17,572
Why do you think
they let you live?

1212
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,111
He's in PR, Mom.

1213
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:21,212
I'm ready.

1214
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:22,713
He said something
about a message.

1215
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:24,723
Sweet Jesus.

1216
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:30,095
Randy!

1217
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:37,069
Wilson!

1218
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:42,107
Go on.

1219
01:14:47,215 --> 01:14:48,147
Mommy.
It's gonna be

1220
01:14:48,157 --> 01:14:48,941
all right, baby.

1221
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,074
Stay in here!

1222
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:52,210
They're gonna hurt Wil.
No, I won't let that happen.

1223
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,812
Just keep your head down.

1224
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,518
RANDY: Mommy! Mommy!

1225
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,182
Mommy, where's Wil?

1226
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:00,192
Randy, stay in there!

1227
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:03,721
Mom! Mommy!

1228
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:05,731
Mommy!

1229
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:08,133
Mommy!

1230
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,959
Randy?

1231
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:34,785
Oh God!

1232
01:15:34,795 --> 01:15:37,059
Oh no! Oh, please!

1233
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,759
Oh God! No! No!

1234
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,904
Mommy.

1235
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:59,510
RANDY: Mommy,
where you going?

1236
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,520
Stay right here.

1237
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,258
Oh fuck.

1238
01:16:14,268 --> 01:16:16,268
Okay, okay.

1239
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,763
Mom!

1240
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,773
Get in the house!

1241
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,385
You want me, motherfuckers?
Come on!

1242
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,172
Come on!

1243
01:16:28,182 --> 01:16:29,340
Mom, you're wide open.

1244
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,648
Come on, let's go,
come on!

1245
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:35,054
Come on, Mom!

1246
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:39,770
MILLIE:
Go get Randy, go get Randy

1247
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,919
and go down to the basement!

1248
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,821
WILSON: Mom...
Do what I tell you!

1249
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,121
Just do what I tell you.

1250
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:46,511
Just back away
from the door.

1251
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,791
Are you hurt?

1252
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,317
No.

1253
01:17:13,327 --> 01:17:15,327
Okay.

1254
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:18,631
I want this to end.

1255
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,495
Wilson, I want this to end.

1256
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,095
Oh, God,
I want this to end, Wilson!

1257
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:26,105
Mom.

1258
01:17:30,444 --> 01:17:31,770
Oh, God, are you hurt?

1259
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,037
No, I'm okay.
Mom. Mom, I'm okay.

1260
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:36,414
I'm just, I'm just so tired.
I just...

1261
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,985
You're my heart.

1262
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,245
Baby, come here.

1263
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:43,255
Randy!

1264
01:17:43,524 --> 01:17:45,520
Oh, baby. Are you okay?

1265
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,651
I'm okay, Mommy.

1266
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:48,658
Okay.

1267
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:50,187
I'm sorry, Mom.

1268
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:51,656
I should have
known you were right.

1269
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,190
You understand,
do you understand

1270
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,659
that I would do
anything for you?

1271
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:58,095
I would do anything for you!
I would do...

1272
01:17:58,105 --> 01:18:00,564
I would do
anything for you, Son.

1273
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:02,199
Mommy.

1274
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:03,769
It's okay.
You're all right, okay?

1275
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,779
It's gonna be okay.

1276
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,750
You're my heart.

1277
01:18:11,052 --> 01:18:13,111
My sons. Oh, God.

1278
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,956
My sons.

1279
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,968
Okay, Miss DeLeon,
tell me from the top.

1280
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,978
From the beginning.

1281
01:18:40,147 --> 01:18:42,147
There was two men.

1282
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,878
They came into the house.

1283
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:50,589
Miss DeLeon?

1284
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,775
If it's not about the money,
then why?

1285
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,860
Because it's never about why
with those kinds of people.

1286
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,662
It's about what's theirs.

1287
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,869
And about what's yours
that's theirs.

1288
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,900
I don't understand, Mom.

1289
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,985
I said that it wasn't
about the two million

1290
01:19:11,995 --> 01:19:13,237
because it isn't.

1291
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:16,562
At least, not money
that belongs to him.

1292
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:18,757
So the money does exist.

1293
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:21,253
My husband.

1294
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,863
Your father never
skimmed money or stole

1295
01:19:23,873 --> 01:19:24,916
from Javier Cordero.

1296
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,918
Ever dime
that he worked for

1297
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,619
he earned.

1298
01:19:28,629 --> 01:19:30,521
Work, Mom?

1299
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:31,923
Okay, what's that
all about, Son?

1300
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,524
He was a drug dealer.

1301
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:35,530
He was a criminal.

1302
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,536
He was a good person

1303
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:39,605
who made bad choices.

1304
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:41,532
But if judging
your Dad is something

1305
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:42,801
you need to do
right now, Son,

1306
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,851
I'm gonna let you do it.

1307
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:48,922
But you still have so much
to learn about life.

1308
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,275
Understand this.

1309
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:53,057
You wouldn't have
had the good life

1310
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:54,578
that you've had up until now,

1311
01:19:54,588 --> 01:19:55,914
if it wasn't for him.

1312
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,749
So if you're going
to judge your father

1313
01:19:58,759 --> 01:20:01,318
for wanting to provide us
with a better life,

1314
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:02,788
then, Son, you're gonna
have to do that

1315
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,693
with everyone
else that you know

1316
01:20:04,703 --> 01:20:05,556
who's made it.

1317
01:20:05,566 --> 01:20:09,816
Because if you dig deep
enough into people's lives,

1318
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:12,396
you're gonna find stains.

1319
01:20:15,676 --> 01:20:18,144
Stains in all our histories.

1320
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,283
All right, let's go.

1321
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:24,441
No, I'm sorry, Mom, okay?

1322
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:26,277
Before we leave...
The money.

1323
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:28,045
It still exists, right?

1324
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:29,780
The money is still
in our possession

1325
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:31,448
and worth a lot more
than two million,

1326
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,498
only now, thanks to Mom,

1327
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:36,195
it's legitimate tender,

1328
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:38,707
just like everyone else's.

1329
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:41,433
So, where do we go?

1330
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:45,437
This has to end.

1331
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,866
Why are you doing
this to us?

1332
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,876
This is not about us.

1333
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,335
Like you said,
if your mother has

1334
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:52,603
all the money she's
ever going to need,

1335
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:53,671
then why are you doing this?

1336
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:55,724
Because I know now
that it doesn't

1337
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:56,908
matter where we go.

1338
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,576

They're not going to stop.

you sound like?

I'm not a gangster, Ana!

That's right, you're
not a gangster, Wilson.

1342
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:05,985
It has to end!
It has to end!

1343
01:21:08,562 --> 01:21:09,754
This is too much.

1344
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:10,889
This is not why
I got into this.

1345
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,123
Well, then why did
you get into this? Why?

1346
01:21:13,133 --> 01:21:17,633
Originally because I thought
you were smarter than me.

1347
01:21:17,643 --> 01:21:19,638
So, where do we go now?

1348

and you tell me

going to be all right.

01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:23,141
My sister was 17.

1445
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:26,495
That's illegal
in your country.

1446
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:32,878
By the time I got to New York
to bring her back,

1447
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,921
she was dead.

1448
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:38,456
She killed herself

1449
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:42,336
and the baby
she was carrying

1450
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:43,531
for one month.

1451
01:31:44,331 --> 01:31:49,006
I thought killing your father
would have done it for me.

1452
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:54,183
I couldn't understand
why I felt so dissatisfied.

1453
01:31:56,243 --> 01:31:58,134
But then it came to me.

1454
01:31:58,144 --> 01:32:01,113
He killed the one person

1455
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:05,307
I love more than
anything in the world.

1456
01:32:09,589 --> 01:32:11,969
But I suppose things change.

1457
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,560
If he were alive today,

1458
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:18,655
you would be the one
person that he would

1459
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,824
love more than
anything in the world.

1460
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:22,834
Javier!

1461
01:32:35,448 --> 01:32:37,448
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1462
01:33:10,617 --> 01:33:12,617
Come on.

1463
01:33:42,549 --> 01:33:44,549
What's that?

1464
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,110
WILSON: Shit! Mom...

1465
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,120
Okay. It's okay.

1466
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:52,504
Come on,
give it some gas,

1467
01:33:52,514 --> 01:33:53,116
right now!

1468
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:56,951
All right, go a little faster,
buddy, come on.

1469
01:33:58,398 --> 01:33:59,724
Put your head down.
What are you going to do?

1470
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:02,029
Put your head down, Wilson.

1471
01:34:52,585 --> 01:34:55,050
Just stay close,
Wilson, okay?

1472
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,768
He works for Cordero, Mom.

1473
01:35:18,778 --> 01:35:20,261
I used to.
You took care

1474
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:21,237
of that for me.

1475
01:35:21,247 --> 01:35:23,712
No,
he didn't take care of it.

1476
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:30,516
Don't give him
the gun, Mom.

1477
01:35:55,816 --> 01:35:57,816
Don't give him the gun.

1478
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,920
But this one?

1479
01:36:35,054 --> 01:36:38,534
This one for me
because this one's the one

1480
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,409
that got me my empire.

1481
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:01,613
Well, it's my time now.

1482
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,980
Let's go, Wilson.

1483
01:37:42,222 --> 01:37:43,813
Why'd you have to
give him the gun?

1484
01:37:43,823 --> 01:37:48,243
Because sometimes you play
the only chips you've got.

1485
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:08,279
(HORN HONKS)

1486
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:12,414
Not a good idea to be
walking these streets

1487
01:38:12,424 --> 01:38:13,524
at this hour.

1488
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,746
You're right.

1489
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:17,513
Okay, let's get in.

1490
01:38:17,523 --> 01:38:19,523
Hop right in.

1491
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:24,763
How you doing, Solomon?

1492
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:28,391
SOLOMON:
Going up with each morning

1493
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:31,971
and with the sun
following me like madness.

1494
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:47,978
This is all they had.

1495
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:49,988
Sorry.

1496
01:38:51,424 --> 01:38:53,424
I'm starving.

1497
01:39:11,044 --> 01:39:13,084
Can I ask you something?

1498
01:39:13,246 --> 01:39:15,246
Sure.

1499
01:39:17,183 --> 01:39:21,263
When you spoke with Cordero,
did you ask him why?

1500
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:25,189
Yeah.

1501
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:30,696
What did he say?

1502
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:37,179
It's about the money, Mom.

1503
01:39:37,537 --> 01:39:39,537
Just like you said.

1504
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:45,910
Money.

1505
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:49,439
The money?

1506
01:39:49,449 --> 01:39:51,449
Yeah.

1507
01:39:55,355 --> 01:39:57,355
What do you know?

1508
01:39:58,658 --> 01:40:01,919
It's all about the money
with those kinds of people.

1509
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:04,090
Yeah, you're right.

1510
01:40:20,179 --> 01:40:22,179
You tired?
Yeah.

1511
01:40:22,548 --> 01:40:24,548
Okay.

1512
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:27,076
Let's go home, Son.

1513
01:40:27,086 --> 01:40:28,478
Okay.

1514
01:40:28,488 --> 01:40:30,488
Okay.

1515
01:40:46,005 --> 01:40:48,005
Dude!

1516
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,140
Where's my baby?
Come here.

1517
01:40:51,444 --> 01:40:53,444
Come here.

1518
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,838
I missed you so much.

1519
01:40:55,848 --> 01:40:57,888
God, you need a haircut.

1520
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:02,045
Look who's here.
Look who's there.

1521
01:41:02,055 --> 01:41:04,055
Will!
Come here.

1522
01:41:04,123 --> 01:41:06,333
I missed you!
I missed you.

1523
01:41:07,326 --> 01:41:09,326
It's all good.

1524
01:41:09,729 --> 01:41:11,729
Give me some.

1525
01:41:13,499 --> 01:41:14,591
You the man.

1526
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:15,958
That's right.

1527
01:41:15,968 --> 01:41:17,060
I could tell.

1528
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,796
Can I cut in?

1529
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,806
MILLIE: Come here.

1530
01:41:21,174 --> 01:41:23,174
Hey.
Hey.

1531
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:26,537
Thank you for
taking care of him.

1532
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:28,547
He took care of me.

1533
01:41:38,091 --> 01:41:40,091
Come on.

1534
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,694
Like a werewolf.

1535
01:41:42,728 --> 01:41:43,821
Big.

1536
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:45,254
What are you telling her?

1537
01:41:45,264 --> 01:41:47,223
What are you telling her?

1538
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:49,690
I'm telling her
that your father has

1539
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,961
very big eyebrows.

1540
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:52,395
Cute.
Like a werewolf.

1541
01:41:52,405 --> 01:41:54,430
You're kidding me?
Is that real?

1542
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,095
I still look forward
to meeting your family.
