1
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,219
My name's Charles Bronson.

2
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,560
And all my life I've wanted
to be famous.

3
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,119
I knew I was made

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,829
for better things.

5
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,409
I had a calling.

6
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,590
I just didn't know

7
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,549
what as.

8
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,549
Weren't singing.

9
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,469
Can't fucking act.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Kind of running out
of choices really,

11
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,849
aren't we?

00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,430

31
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,620
Right, how else can I explain it?

32
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:33,090
There was nothing wonky
about my upbringing.

33
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,629
My parents were decent,

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
respectable and upstanding
members of society.

35
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,389
I went to school.

36
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,389
I kept my head down.

37
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,639
So like most kids,

38
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,600
I got into trouble.

39
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:50,480
You bastard!

40
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,350
I liked it.

41
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,579
Oh, Michael.

42
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Mrs. Peterson, I really must
talk to you about Michael.

43
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,420
But I wasn't bad.

44
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,379
I wasn't bad bad.

45
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,009
And I still have my principles.

46
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,889
I took the first job
I could get my hands on.

47
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,689
Bring the fries, Peterson.

48
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,230
I suppose the crumpet
wasn't bad.

49
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,930
Mrs. Peterson,

50
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,850
we'd like to have
a word with your son.

51
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,480
Michael.

52
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,610
Michael Peterson.

53
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,069
Right.

54
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,699
Yeah, before I forget,

55
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,540
I did come into this world
as Michael Peterson.

56
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,959
But I'll go out
with my fighting name...

57
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Charlie Bronson.

58
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,379
Which is my alter ego.

59
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,560
1974...

60
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,689
tough time
to be young in England.

61
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,610
Not a lot of opportunity around.

62
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,120
Still, life moves on.

63
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,750
Irene and I got hitched.

64
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,579
It was all right.

65
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,420
We didn't have it bad
for a couple from the chippy.

66
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:23,509
But they don't give you
a star on the walk of fame

67
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,300
for "not bad," do they?

68
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,600
Michael, what is that noise?

69
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:41,730
For God's sakes.

70
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,199
So this is the post office

71
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,079
I did over.

72
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,740
This is what I got away with.

73
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,540
And this is what they gave me.

74
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,750
Seven years!

75
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,050
Don't worry, son.

76
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,430
You won't do the seven.
You'll be out in four.

77
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,080
I had you going, didn't I?
Huh?

78
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,210
Go on!
I had you going!

79
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,460
I've always fancied myself
as a bit of a comedian.

80
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,840
But seven years

81
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,929
is a long time.

82
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,269
Now I'm not gonna
stand here, right, and tell you...

83
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,769
tell you that prison

84
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,769
is "not bad."

85
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,570
No, that would be
misrepresenting myself.

86
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,570
And I think enough of that
has been done already,

87
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,529
don't you?

88
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
No.

89
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,330
You see, I didn't see
a cell, a cage

90
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,090
or a box.

91
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,840
To me, it was a hotel room.

92
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,149
Don't get me wrong.

93
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,820
For most people,

94
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,529
prison is tough.

95
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,779
A monotonous nightmare.

96
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,120
24 hours a day,

97
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,580
seven days a week,

98
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,080
365 days a year

99
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,840
of pure, unadulterated,

100
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,799
living, breathing hell.

101
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,769
But for me,

102
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,139
prison was finally a place

103
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,809
where I could sharpen my tools,

104
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,110
hone my skills.

105
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,610
It's like a battleground,
isn't it?

106
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,070
It was an opportunity

107
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,409
and a place where soon
every native

108
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,740
was gonna know my name.

109
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,549
What's the matter, Charlie?

110
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,090
Do you want me to take
you through it again?

111
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,470
No, we don't do work
in long-term prisons.

112
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,309
It's vocational training
so you can get a job when-.

113
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,559
Fuck off!

114
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,870
What's the problem, Peterson?

115
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,210
Problem?

116
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,129
I said, what's the problem,
Peterson?

117
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,759
I don't know.
I don't have a problem.

118
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,129
Keep your chin up, mate.

119
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,590
Oh, crikey.

120
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,259
Would you like
a cup of tea, mate?

121
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,269
Thanks, Mickey.
Love one.

122
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,269
- Milk and sugar?
- Please.

123
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,190
- How many sugars?
- Two.

124
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,519
One, two.

132
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,139
Nothing closer to my heart
than a good cup

133
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,929
of British char.

134
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,929
- Milk and sugar?
- No, I like it dark.

135
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,139
Oh.

136
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,610
That's an impressive set
of guns you have there.

137
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,490
You must be handy in a brawl.
Bam-bam,

138
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,490
knockout, ding-ding.

139
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,250
Very nice.

140
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,309
But time stops for no man,
ladies and germs.

141
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,220
And my time was coming up.

142
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,389
Parole!

143
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,820
And just when I was about
to make a name to be reckoned with.

144
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,649
Oh, yeah, as what?

145
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,610
As what?

146
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,039
You don't wanna be trapped
inside with me, sunshine.

147
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:36,500
Inside, I'm someone
nobody wants to fuck with.

148
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,379
Do you understand?

149
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,429
I am Charlie Bronson.

150
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,259
I am Britain's
most violent prisoner.

151
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,980
Prison was,

152
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,320
honestly, brilliant!

153
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,440
I liked it personally.
Fuck that. I loved it!

154
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,110
It was exciting.
It was on the edge.

155
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,789
It was madness as its very best.

156
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,470
The problem is
once you get comfortable,

157
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,679
or sometimes even before,
they ghost you again

158
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,429
and again,
moving you from prison

159
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,559
to prison to prison.

160
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,600
And I fucking hate that.

161
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:45,149
Parkhurst, God bless that place.

162
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,029
The accommodation
was more than worthy

163
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,450
of my royal self.

164
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,320
Your own bed,

165
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,909
toilet, a sink.

166
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,330
The food was
of exceptional standard.

167
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,289
Yes, Parkhurst was a corker.

168
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,549
And hull prison,
well, what can I say?

169
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,759
Well worth a visit.

170
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,930
Scrubs-not my
favorite place to visit.

171
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,640
But the staff are ready
to make your stay

172
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,769
as memorable as possible.

173
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,890
We had a laugh.

174
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,769
How we laughed.

Quite seriously wrong, actually.

181
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,839
They sent me here,

182
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,299
the funny farm.

183
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,119
Where are we going?

184
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,829
Oh, what have you got for me,
you jolly boys?

185
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,750
Jolly boys all the lot of you.

186
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,369
Cunt cunt cunt cunt cunt.

187
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,789
Wait till I fucking kick
the shit out the lot of you.

188
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,710
Right, Peterson.
Now you've had a chance to cool down.

189
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,759
I'll explain the rampton rules.

190
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,299
Rule number one,
you do as you're told.

191
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,009
Rule number two?

192
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,470
This ain't prison.

193
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,309
We're lion tamers here.

194
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,559
Uh-huh.

195
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,609
Right, take these pills.

196
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:57,740
Stick 'em up your fucking ass.

197
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,359
Yeah, huh?

198
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,079
Yeah, he'll be back. Cunt.

199
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,670
Fucking whip rag,
you'll fucking shit it.

200
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,470
You fucking gone
and done it, you cunt!

201
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,269
You fucking cunt!
You fucking cunt!

202
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,579
The thing is

203
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,710
they don't understand.

204
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,960
They'll never understand.

205
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,250
And that scares 'em.

206
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,339
So they keep you drugged up.

207
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,849
What's that gonna change?

208
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,309
Ain't gonna change
the you inside.

209
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,690
I think I know the truth.

210
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,190
You're no more mad than I am.

211
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,740
Yeah, it's all just made up.
It's rubbish.

212
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,329
You, me...

213
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,759
nine-year-old girl.

214
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,970

Fucking loonies,
they're great, mate,

242
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,309
but...

243
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,400
well...

244
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:15,240
they're fucking loonies,
aren't they?

245
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:19,950
And I had to get out somehow.

246
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,410
This was not a hotel I wanted

247
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,789
to stay at anymore.

248
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,789
Being a celebrity and all,
I needed to check out.

249
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,759
And I had a good idea
how to do it.

250
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,279
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

251
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,940
I will now reenact

252
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,650
what I like to call

253
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,990
"what happens
when murder goes wrong."

254
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,000
When do I go back?

255
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,460
Now now, Mr. Peterson,

256
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,799
We aren't going to start up
all that silliness again, are we?

257
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,839
Listen, nursey,

258
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:11,009
I just wanna know
when my trial is

259
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,640
and when I head back
to the slammer,

260
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,440
Right?

261
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,859
Wrong, Mr. Peterson.

262
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,990
Now let's not play
silly buggers, eh?

263
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,319
I'll just have to pop you in the botty
with one of my special potions, hmm?

264
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:34,619
When's my trial?

265
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:41,039
Uh-uh-uh.
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, no.

266
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,759
Mr. White recovered, dear.

267
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,009
There's no trial.

268
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,349
Isn't that wonderful?

269
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,809
However, you are being moved.

270
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:59,559
Where?

271
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:05,940
Yes, Mr. Peterson.
Broadmoor Asylum

272
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:08,240
for the criminally insane.

273
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,500
I deserve to go to prison
for what I did.

274
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,170
I want my hotel room back.

275
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,839
Well, I'm sure you'll
find yourself some solitary.

276
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,809
And I did.

277
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,859
26 years.

278
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,980
26 years of solitary I've done,

279
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,609
and I ain't killed no one.

280
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,779
I'm not joking.

281
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,029
Not a soul!

282
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,119
Ever!

283
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,920
Well, I thought,

284
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:09,420
"If you're gonna be
unfair with me,

285
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:12,009
I'm gonna show you the ultimate

286
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,259
in unfair takedowns."

287
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,730
Now this is what I call.

288
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,980
"Charlie

Well, that told me.

299
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,389
Truth be told, though,
they didn't want me

300
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,309
in there anymore anyway.

301
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,559
Apparently, I've managed
to cost the system

302
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,440
tens of millions of pounds
in damage.

303
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,110
And her majesty no longer
wanted to pleasure herself

304
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,949
with Britain's most
expensive prisoner.

305
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,909
I know. It's not the moniker
that I was looking for,

306
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,039
but what were they gonna do?

307
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean, they couldn't let
a loony run around for free.

308
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,130
Oh yeah.

309
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:12,260
They had a dirty trick
up their sleeve.

310
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,800
They only went
and certified me sane,

311
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:17,800
didn't they?

312
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:21,219
So before I knew it,
I was back on the streets again.

313
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,690
But Charlie B.
ain't no fucking pillow biter.

314
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:29,110
Oh, no.
So it was time

315
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:31,440
to suck up the free air

316
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,199
and see what the world
had to offer me.

317
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Very funny, boys.

318
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,780
Right.

319
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,079
It's been a pleasure.

320
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,730
Look at you. Dad.

321
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,320
Hi, son.

322
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,489
Come on in, son.

323
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,039
That's right.
I'll show you your room,

324
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,329
and then we'll have
a nice cup of tea.

325
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,340
Come on, son.

326
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,679
That's right.

327
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,059
Oh, look, it's me.

328
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,519
I was very small.

329
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,829
Where's all my stuff?

330
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,789
We couldn't bring
everything, Michael.

331
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,250
That was Luton.

332
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,880
What, all of it?

333
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,429
We kept some.

334
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:48,679
Where's my bed?

335
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,849
No, not this one.
The other one,

336
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,480
what I had when I was a child.

337
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,900
We couldn't keep
everything, Michael.

338
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,690
We don't have the room.

339
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,380
Is my bed still in Luton?

340
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,210
Luton...

341
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,880
never changes, does it?

342
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,349
Now my mom once said,
"Stick with what you know."

343
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,059
And I knew two things.

344
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,809
I knew Luton
and I knew Uncle Jack.

345
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,519
And Uncle Jack knew everyone.

346
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,150
And anyone he didn't know
wasn't worth knowing.

347
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,789
Going on holiday?

348
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,079
No.

349
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,840
Something better than that.
I'm gonna make a name for myself.

350
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, yeah, doing what?

351
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,260
I'm gonna kill the queen.

352
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,929
So you're off to London then?

353
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,679
No.

354
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,809
Luton's where it's at.

355
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,400
Well, fuck me inside out.

356
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:54,570
Come in, my dear boy.
You're just in time for cocktails.

357
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,380
Hello.

358
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:07,210
Hello.

359
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
Luton calling.

360
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,719
Ladies and gentlemen
in ladies' attire,

361
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,599
allow me to present
my favorite nephew,

362
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,679
newly relieved
of Her Majesty's pleasure,

363
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:21,179
Mickey Peterson.

364
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:24,349
Sit down, my dear boy.

365
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,610
I'll sit there.

366
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:28,690
How are you?

367
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,940
Miss gorgeous here

368
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,780
will get you a cocktail.

369
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:38,739
Michael.

370
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:41,500
It's very exciting to meet you.

371
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,630
Our Jack here, he says
you're quite a celebrity on the inside.

372
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:48,800
Mmm.

373
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,260
Oh. Thank you.

374
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,559
It's a complete turnoff.

375
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:06,099
Mm-hmm.

376
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:08,150
Your face rug.

377
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:10,780
Be like kissing a fanny.

378
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,900
Ooh.

379
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,780
That's an outstanding
set of mustaches.

380
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:20,119
I admire your dedication.

381
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,739
Mmm.

382
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:25,420
I always knew you had
an artistic bent.

383
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,260
So, big boy,

384
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,090
what does the future hold
for Michael Peterson?

385
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:41,929
Ooh.

386
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,170
Ambition is the virtue

387
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,210
of all great men.

388
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,599
He's going to stay here with us.

389
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:24,219
All right, my pets?

390
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:28,690
Say the more the merrier.

391
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,650
For as long as you like.

392
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:45,369
That's very strong.

393
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,960
It's wonderful.

394
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,550
Uncle Jack always had
his ear to the ground.

395
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,800
And it turns out, there was an old prison
mate of mine in Luton too.

396
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,730
- Peterson.
- This your gaff?

397
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:09,139
Yes.

398
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:11,690
How much you get?

399
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,190
10 years.

400
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,980
Fucking hell.

401
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,989
Make Mickey a cup
of tea, please.

402
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,500
Let's fuck.

403
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,760
So are you interested?

404
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,340
Of course I fucking am.

405
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,889
You're looking good, Mickey.

406
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:50,559
Fit, strong,

407
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,690
powerful.

408
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,190
You can make some money.

409
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,190
Serious money.

410
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,489
All you need's a name.

411
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,909
What's wrong
with Mickey Peterson?

412
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,659
No, you need a fighting name.

413
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,829
Like a movie star.

414
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,170
Oh, right.

415
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,849
Charlton Heston.

416
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,599
Look, love,

417
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:36,309
nobody gives a toss
about Charlton Heston.

418
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,940
The man's a cunt.

419
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,489
You're more
the Charles Bronson type.

420
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,239
Charles Bronson.

421
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:48,369
Yes, "Death Wish."

422
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,659
That's you down
to a tee, perfect.

423
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,869
Charlie...

424
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,039
Fucking Bronson.

425
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,340

I can feel you
looking at me, Charlie.

439
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,389
Do you want me to do your nails?

440
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,519
No.

441
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,739
What's that from?

442
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,909
Fight.

443
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,530
And that one?

444
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,949
Fight.

445
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,159
Fight.

446
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,090
You're very muscley, aren't you?

447
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,170
Mind if I hold your arm?

448
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:16,179
Oh my God.

449
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:20,269
It's huge.

450
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,070
Um...

451
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,110
you should-.

452
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,699
What?

453
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:38,409
You-you shouldn't-.

454
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,829
What, Charlie?

455
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,289
You shouldn't mess around with boys
what are bigger than you.

456
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Oh, really?

457
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,780
Shit.

458
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,150
Lucky man.
Lucky cunt.

459
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:22,420
Oh, yeah!

460
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,050
Hey! All right.

461
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:36,349
Hey!

462
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,179
Yeah.

463
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:44,730
Do you want some
fucking murder, yeah?

464
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,610
Who wants some fucking murder?

465
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,690
You don't look well, mate.

466
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,570
All right, you fucking cunt.

467
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:02,710
20 quid? You're having
a fucking laugh, ain't you?

468
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:05,000
Spare me the Oliver
Twist routine.

469
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,829
Charlie, love, you need to build
your audience.

470
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,340
I gave you fucking magic
in there.

471
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,920
Magic?
You just pissed on a gypsy

472
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,630
in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

473
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,929
It's hardly the hottest
ticket in town, darling.

474
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,889
All right, when is the next one?

475
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:30,480
Let him fucking go.
If he wants to go,

476
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,809
let him fucking go!

477
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,940
- Come on!
- Have at him!

478
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,130
I love you.

479
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,380
What?

480
00:54:06,929 --> 00:54:09,059
I love you.

481
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,739
- It's been nice.
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:28,159
But I love Brian.

483
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,789
Who's Brian?

484
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,170
He's my boyfriend.

485
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:45,179
And he's got a motorbike.

486
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:52,599
Brian.

487
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,400
Yes, sir, can I help you?

488
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,860
Yeah, well...

489
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,159
I want to take a butchers
at that ring there.

490
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,789
That ring there, sir?
That's a £1,000 ring, sir.

491
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:14,750
Right. Fuck off!

492
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,460
Don't fucking move!

493
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,010
Or I'll kill you, all right?

494
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,840
Don't fucking move!

495
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,179
And don't call the police

496
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:31,349
- for 10 minutes.
- I won't.

497
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:33,599
All right?

498
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,900
15 minutes.

499
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,070
Happy Christmas.

500
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,880
I've been thinking...

501
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,800
You're a very
sweet man, Charlie.

502
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:11,760
...about-about you.

503
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:15,139
Yeah, but you've
got no ambition.

504
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,639
You know what I mean?

505
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,070
Bought you this.

506
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,699
Eh?

507
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,420
Eh?

508
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,590
Thank you.

509
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:50,929
Brian and me
are getting married.

510
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:04,610
Right.

511
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,570
Well...

512
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:10,280
congratulations.

513
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:12,119
Eh?

514
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:19,960
See you later, Charlie.

515
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:42,900
Fucking charming.

516
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,269
Onwards and upwards.

517
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,239
That's what I always say.

518
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,449
Everything happens
for a reason, don't it?

519
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:59,329
Hear hear.

520
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,460
Magic.

521
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,960
Well, it turns out

522
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,300
that lovely lady
in the jewelry shop

523
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:14,639
waited exactly 15 minutes.

524
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,139
But it didn't take them
15 minutes to find me.

525
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,599
We'd been expecting them.

526
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:05,480
Well well well.

527
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,440
Charles Bronson is it now?

528
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,739
An American Mongolian pop star.

529
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,699
Film star, sir.
"Death Wish."

530
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:18,739
Bloody good, as it happens.

531
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:22,159
Yeah, I'm sure, Webber.
I'm sure, thank you.

532
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,460
So...

533
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,500
69 days, was it?

534
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,300
69 days all to yourself.

535
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,179
Another of your prison
records broken.

536
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,429
So tell me, Charles Bronson,

537
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:43,099
what exactly did
you do with yourself

538
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:45,690
for these 69 days?

539
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,769
I was building an empire.

540
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,699
You're ridiculous.

541
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:26,639
Good morning, Charlie.
Something to read?

542
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:30,400
Got another Jilly Cooper.

543
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,570
Tell me how you got on
with "Who Dares Wins" then.

544
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,739
I've heard it's really good.

545
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,400
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- No problem, Charlie.

546
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,869
Shut the fuck up, you cunt!

547
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,289
Shut it!

548
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,340
Right.

549
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,719
Now I've got
a librarian up here.

550
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,719
And he's in a lot of trouble.

551
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:08,349
So I think you should send
someone up

552
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:10,349
to help him out, don't you?

553
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:13,570
For fuck's sake,
he's at it again.

554
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,400
He's got a hostage.
Get the governor!

555
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,199
Right.

556
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Sit down.

557
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:26,579
Not there! On the fucking
karzy, you cunt!

558
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:52,599
What happens now?

559
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:54,900
Um...

560
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,900
I don't know.

561
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,909
Well, I guess we'll
just have to...

562
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,869
we'll have to wait.

563
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:10,869
I can wait all day.
I'm not going anywhere.

564
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,130
You're not going anywhere,
you fucking cunt.

565
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:15,380
We'll just fucking wait.
I'll wait.

566
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,289
- Hello.
- Hello, Charlie.

567
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,750
- Can you hear me?
- Of course I can fucking hear you.

568
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,260
There's nothing wrong
with my hearing, you cunt.

569
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,510
What is it, Charlie?

570
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,139
What is it, Charlie?

571
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,139
Well...

572
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:12,139
I am sitting here with...

573
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,559
what's your name?

574
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,400
- Love.
- Love?!

575
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,400
- Andy Love.
- Oh, Andy Love.

576
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,070
Yeah?

577
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:24,989
All right, I'm sitting here

578
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:27,570
with Andy Love.

579
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:29,780
And I'm gonna snap
his fucking neck

580
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:32,829
and stick his head up
his ass if I don't get what I want!

581
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,329
What do you want?

582
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,420
What do I want?

583
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,969
What have you got?

584
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:49,010
Well...

585
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:52,849
that's entirely up to you,

586
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:54,849
isn't it?

587
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:58,559
We're done. You can fuck off.
I've had enough.

588
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,070
All right...

589
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:10,369
Andy Love.

590
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,159
Are you a family man?

591
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:17,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

592
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,920
- I got two kids.
- Two kids, yeah?

593
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,050
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

594
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,920
What does it fucking look like
I'm doing, you cunt?

595
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,429
- Look, let's-let's talk.
- No, I'm done talking.

596
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,219
Fucking pointless.

597
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:34,679
- Wait-
- Wait for what?

598
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:37,639
Right.

599
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:39,400
- That's it.
- What are you gonna do now?

600
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:41,650
What am I gonna do?

601
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,820
I'm gonna put my
fucking body paint on.

602
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,940
That's what I'm gonna do.

603
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,820
Get my body armor, all right?

604
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,909
Fucking hell.

605
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,739
Let's have it.

606
01:04:54,909 --> 01:04:56,829
Go on, get some of that rubbed on
my back, you cunt.

607
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,329
- What?
- Get it on my fucking back.

608
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,539
Rub it in, you slag!

609
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,590
Go on, rub it in.
That's right. We ain't got all day.

610
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,260
Rub it right down my back.

611
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,340
Down my back and my legs.

612
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,929
Back of my legs, on my ass.

613
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,889
On my ass cheeks.
On my ass.

614
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,849
Not in my ass, you fucking homo!
On it.

615
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:18,059
Quickly. Quicker.
Quicker. Quicker!

616
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,980
Quicker! Quicker!
Quicker! Quicker!

617
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,900
Quicker! Quicker!
Fuck off!

618
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:25,230
Sit down in the corner.
Don't move, cunt!

619
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:30,280
Now hang on
to your fillings, right?

620
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:33,119
'Cause it's gonna
get fucking hairy.

621
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:37,579
- Come here.
- Fuck off, you cunt!

622
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:15,119
All right, Charlie Bronson.

623
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:18,579
I'll get straight to the point.

624
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,119
We have been sailing rather close
to the wind of late,

625
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:23,500
and I detect a rocky patch.

626
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,340
I had hoped that you coming

627
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,710
onto the special unit
with us might make you want

628
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,800
to stop this hostage
taking business,

629
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,969
this attacking of my officers.

630
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:37,760
We can handle this prick, sir.

631
01:06:37,929 --> 01:06:39,269
Webber, will you please
take the rest

632
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:40,929
of the afternoon off?
Thank you.

633
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:43,139
Be in my office at 6:15 sharp
tomorrow morning.

634
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:46,309
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Yes, sir.

635
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,159
Look, I'm not in the habit

636
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,659
of making deals with prisoners.

637
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,489
For your recent escapade,

638
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:01,869
you will be punished again.
Block.

639
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,210
If you have absolutely
no interest whatsoever

640
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,710
in yourself,

641
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,469
then you leave us at a loss
with regards what to do with you.

642
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:20,769
What would you like us to do,

643
01:07:20,929 --> 01:07:23,309
Charlie Bronson?

644
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,610
Fuck off.

645
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,610
You're pitiful.

646
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,329
You know that?

647
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,659
And I can promise you this,

648
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:44,369
if you further this
mindless behavior,

649
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:47,880
if you continue to act
in this nihilistic and godless fashion,

650
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:50,550
you will die inside.

651
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,680
Un, dos, tres.

652
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,899
Cuatro.

653
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:55,989
Como esta?

654
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:58,279
- What?
- What's this?

655
01:08:58,449 --> 01:09:00,449
- A painting.
- Good for you.

656
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:03,159
Now what do you mean?
Talk to me.

657
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:08,039
Sun, sea, sand,
naked women, perfect.

658
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,250
- Whose is this?
- Eh?

659
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,460
Whose is this?

660
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,760
Come on, own up.
Who did the crime?

661
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,100
Bombs away.

662
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,970
Not your art teacher
for nothing, you know?

663
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,649
Very interesting, Charlie.

664
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:48,750
Interesting?

665
01:09:48,909 --> 01:09:51,920
Yeah, it's interesting.

666
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,840
What does that mean?

667
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,130
What does interesting mean?
Interesting's good.

668
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,630
Bravado!

669
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
You know?

670
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,850
Yeah, you can't pin it down,
can't compute.

671
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:11,600
You can't tie that up
in a nice little pink bow.

672
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:15,689
No, you can't pin me down, mate.

673
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,189
- Pajaros!
- You fucking what?

674
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:20,149
Birds. Birds, Charlie.
I'm leaning Spanish.

675
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,199
- Español.
- Oh.

676
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:23,779
Are you?

677
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:25,409
Olé!

678
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:32,750
Lot of birds
in your work, Charlie.

679
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,829
I don't really get
to see much through...

680
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,789
bit of birds

681
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,920
and bars.

682
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,010
Pajaros.

683
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,640
Pajaros.

684
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,010
I know, mate.

685
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,100
Here's an idea for you.

686
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,600
Find that piece of you, Charles.

687
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,439
That piece that
doesn't belong here.

688
01:10:55,609 --> 01:10:58,270
Fucking hell.

689
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,270
Prisoner BT1314, Bronson, sir.

690
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:22,779
Good afternoon, Bronson.

691
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:27,609
Well, Mr. Danielson
here tells me

692
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:30,619
that you've been doing
extraordinarily well

693
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,579
in your creative endeavors.

694
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,000
Champion's a budding Magritte.

695
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,079
That's right, yeah.

696
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,960
You know, we've been
holding these artist materials for you,

697
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,970
sent in by your cousin Lorraine.

698
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,140
Well, now that we're rather sadly having
to consider the future

699
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,180
of the arts facility,

700
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:57,189
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't
be allowed these materials now.

701
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,939
Should help tremendously
with your work.

702
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:03,569
Mr. Danielson really has
got great confidence

703
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:05,489
in your cooperation,

704
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:07,699
your responsibility,

705
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:11,159
your ability to interact
within the group.

706
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:13,029
I strongly advise

707
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,329
that you continue
to follow this path.

708
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,369
And I look forward to seeing some
of this wonderful work

709
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:21,210
I've heard so much about.

710
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,710
Governor, Charlie's
actually brought something

711
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,050
for you to have
a look at now if you'd lik...

712
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,300
Charlie, give me that.

713
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,510
That's for you.

714
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,350
Thank you.

715
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,439
If you give it to Webber,

716
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,270
I'll be able to have
a look at it later.

717
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:43,229
Thank you.

718
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:45,109
Right then, Bronson.
What are you waiting for, son?

719
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,359
Let's go, move it!
Move it!

720
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:51,739
I said, let's go.
Move it!

721
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:01,789
Sorry, Webber.
That's for you, mate.

722
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,510
He's a star fucker, that one.

723
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,600
I'll make sure he looks
at that painting, mate.

724
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,720
Don't you worry about that.

725
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,229
Review the unit-pfft!

726
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,560
Honest to God, though,
Charlie, and I'll tell you this straight,

727
01:14:23,729 --> 01:14:26,729
I wouldn't be surprised if they started
to discuss your release date.

728
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:28,439
I mean, look,
it's just my opinion.

729
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:30,319
It's not necessarily
the opinion of others.

730
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:33,609
But you know,
if there's one thing I am,

731
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:36,409
I am a very good judge

732
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:38,119
of character.

733
01:14:38,289 --> 01:14:40,000
Yep.

734
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,460
Sí sí.
Sí sí sí.

735
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:46,460
You'll get a call, mate.
You will.

736
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,960
You know why?

737
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,130
You're a brilliant artist.

738
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,180
Bueno.
Buenísimo.

739
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,600
I'm so excited, mate.
I'm proud as punch,

740
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,520
'cause you are a fucking star.

741
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,600
Gov's a cunt.
He is. Fuck him.

742
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,600
Can't stand the wanker.

743
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:07,649
Just keep your head down
and I'm absolutely positivo

744
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:09,569
that we can do this.

745
01:15:09,729 --> 01:15:11,739
We can, mate.

746
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:17,579
What do you mean we?

747
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:19,789
We-no.
I'm just saying-.

748
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:21,750
No no no, Charlie.
Charles.

749
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:24,619
Don't misunderstand me, mate.

750
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:28,289
What I'm saying is you...

751
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,800
you are finally gonna get

752
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,550
what you've always wanted.

753
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,810
What do you know
about what I fucking want?

754
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,630
What happened to my tea, Phil?

755
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,640
Sorry, mate. I'm such a cunt.
I completely forgot.

756
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,600
Two for you.

757
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,560
Two for me.

758
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:32,569
And then we have a cup of tea.

759
01:18:01,989 --> 01:18:03,619
Charlie.

760
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:08,619
What is it you want now?

761
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,170
Music.

762
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,430
I don't see how
that's gonna help the situation.

763
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,020
I'll fucking kill him!

764
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:33,729
I swear it!

765
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:38,229
Bennett.

766
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:44,069
- Get me some music on now, please.
- Yes, Gov.

767
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:22,210
Here, Charlie.

768
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,880
Not feeling very well now, mate.

769
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,689
Oh, yeah.

770
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,359
That's a fucking piece of me.

771
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,000
Right, that's enough!
He's had enough.

772
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:50,420
Get him out of here.

773
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,760
Go on, get him the fuck out of here.
He's had enough.

774
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,010
Come on, you fucking cunts.

775
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,350
