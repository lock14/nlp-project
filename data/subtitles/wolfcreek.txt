1
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,975
You traveling with two sheila's,
are you, mate?

2
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,509
Uh, yep.

3
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:53,145
- Two, eh?
- Yep.

4
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:54,747
That'll be a bit of fun, eh?

5
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,886
Yeah, yeah.

6
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,391
Just sign there.

7
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:05,131
They get, uh,
real easy when they travel.

8
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,828
Loosen up a bit, hey?

9
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,838
Mate of mine reckons.
He picks 'em up all the time.

10
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:14,232
Uh-huh.

11
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,802
- That's it?
- Yep, yep.

12
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,969
Good on ya, champ.

13
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,179
Don't do anything I wouldn't do, eh?

14
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:22,974
Nah. I won't.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,509
Send us a card.

16
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:26,244
All right.

17
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,731
Fat fuck. What a tool.

18
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,632
How funny's that?

19
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,941
I like that.
I think we should send that one.

20
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,641
Do ya reckon?

21
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:05,116
Yep.

22
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:12,932
Yep.

23
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,332
Yep.

24
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,475
How long is this gonna take, mate?

25
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:31,952
Not long.

26
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,283
How long's not long?

27
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,483
Well, I've almost got it.

28
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:37,787
Yep.

29
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,161
- Yep.
- Yep!

30
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,289
OK.

31
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,358
Yep.

32
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,833
Yep!

33
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,233
Yep.

34
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,635
- Yep.
- Yep.

35
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,776
He fancies you.

36
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,772
He doesn't.

37
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:59,337
- Does.
- You fancy him.

38
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,006
I don't think so.

39
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:07,712
The three of us are going to be
stuck in a car together for three weeks,

40
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,624
and it'll be trying enough without
"is it me, or is he being weird today?"

41
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,059
It'd drive me barmy.

42
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:15,659
Yeah. You're right.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,191
He is cute, though.

44
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,033
Do you think he's really got
a girlfriend in Sydney?

45
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,470
Why would he lie?

46
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,767
He's a bloke.

47
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,781
I can't believe we're leaving.

48
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,340
I know.

49
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,877
It feels like two years,
not two weeks.

50
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:45,883
Whoo!

51
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:49,186
Wow!

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,729
- Want a lift?
- I'd love it.

53
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,394
I thought I requested purple.

54
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:57,062
Eh. For 1,500 bucks
we're lucky it's got doors.

55
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,129
I love it.

56
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:59,367
Hey, where's my stuff?

57
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,342
We forgot about food for you. Sorry.

58
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,539
Yeah, we thought you'd get by
on our gratitude and appreciation.

59
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:10,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:13,516
Where's the booze?

61
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh, we've made a decision.

62
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,293
After last night,
never drinking again.

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,987
We've got to get an early start

64
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,530
if we want to get to Wolf Creek
by tomorrow night.

65
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,759
Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,858
Piss off. Of course I checked.

67
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,597
How much
of an organization Nazi is she?

68
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,969
No, she's right. In bed by 9:30.

69
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,746
This is bad, actually.

70
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:49,814
Oh!

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,190
You weren't gonna drink that.
Is that your beer?

72
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:55,628
- Patrick. Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:58,565
That's a pretty nice handshake there.
Let's give it a kiss.

74
00:05:58,634 --> 00:05:59,623
Lovely, lovely.

75
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,693
- I can pack a punch.
- You can pack a punch?

76
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:02,931
Why would you want that?

77
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:06,065
- I would if I had to.
- If you had to?

78
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,143
You gotta hear this bullshit story.

79
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:11,279
Bullshit! It wasn't bullshit!

80
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,985
Ten foot wave sprayin'.

81
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:19,715
Shh! Shh!

82
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,278
Go on!

83
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,096
I think it's past 9:30.

84
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:50,567
I got the worst taste in my mouth.

85
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,654
(music) I'd like to sing a song for you

86
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,698
OK, let me start again.

87
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,391
Here we go.

88
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,805
- (music) I love her
- Oh, God.

89
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,344
(music) I really, really love her

90
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:21,574
(music) Make me smile all the time

91
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,682
(music) When you cook my food
and you clean my room

92
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,155
(music) I love you, mum
I love you, mum

93
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,622
(music) He's been playing guitar

94
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,286
(music) For a few weeks now

95
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,660
(music) And he's really,
really, really crap

96
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:38,393
(music) And he's crap

97
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,526
(music) Really shit

98
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:43,003
(music) I'm not that bad

99
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:50,304
Oh, my God!

100
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:51,812
Yeah, that's cool.

101
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,511
That's amazing.

102
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,982
You're near the world's
fifth biggest UFO sighting area.

103
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,544
- Kristy, I'm serious.
- I know!

104
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:03,419
- I can hear you laughing.
- What? I'm listening.

105
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,481
Fine.

106
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,755
- I'm listening.
- Tell us.

107
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,127
Don't listen to her.
Tell me. I'm listening.

108
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,722
All right. I read about this guy

109
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,995
who was driving out
on the highway out there.

110
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:17,061
And he sees this light ahead of him,
around 500 meters,

111
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,666
and at first he thinks it's a truck
or a semi-trailer or something,

112
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:24,042
'cause the light's really bright,
like glowing orange and shit.

113
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,013
- Yeah.
- But as he gets closer,

114
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:30,677
he realizes that the light's
about 10 meters off the ground,

115
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,345
Just hanging in mid-air.

116
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:35,618
So he's scared, freaking out.

117
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,353
And then he hears this... crack!

118
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,687
Like an explosion.

119
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,527
- That was supposed to scare us.
- I know, it's scary.

120
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,760
But he did. He heard this crack.

121
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,235
Like an explosion of a Jet.

122
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:52,707
And it just took off into the sky,
straight up like a rocket.

123
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,369
And then as soon as it was gone,

124
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:58,572
his car just stopped
in the middle of the road

125
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:01,115
and it was totally silent.

126
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:05,552
He was Just sitting there,
staring up at the stars.

127
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,485
In the middle of nowhere.

128
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,686
- Hey...
- No reason. Just stopped.

129
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,787
- Is that a true story?
- I read it.

130
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,390
You've got something
dripping off your lip there.

131
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,456
What?

132
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,526
Oh, it's all right.
It's Just bullshit.

133
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,164
No, bullshit you, mate!

134
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,609
What's all this shit?

135
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,245
- Oh, for the tent.
- For the tent.

136
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:43,189
- Here, I'll do that. Start on the tent.
- No, you do the tent.

137
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,929
I don't know what you two
would do without me.

138
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,269
- I didn't finish that.
- Oh, sorry.

139
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:58,135
- This is it.
- I finished it for you.

140
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:01,002
- What?
- I didn't know what to do!

141
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:02,571
- All right?
- Yep.

142
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:06,943
Now we Just got a six-hour drive.
Who's driving first?

143
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,711
- Oh!
- Who's driving first?

144
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,342
I don't know.
I'll go in the back.

145
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,114
- Is that all right with you?
- Yeah.

146
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,678
- I'll go in the back.
- Do you want to drive?

147
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,397
We're here, guys.

148
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,413
Well, well, well.

149
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,674
Hey, um, can I have the keys?

150
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:29,815
Oh, it's OK, you two. I've got it.

151
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,292
Thanks. No problems, guys.

152
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:07,223
How's the hair?

153
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,730
Day one. Captain's log.

154
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,667
So far, no sign
of intelligent life forms.

155
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:17,536
Starting to doubt... Hey.

156
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,336
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

157
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,400
Um, do you wanna say hello?

158
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:23,903
Hi.

159
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,470
Righto. What's your name?

160
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:26,674
- Graham.
- Graham.

161
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,046
Nice to meet you, Graham.

162
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,846
I'm Ben.

163
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,910
- This one too?
- Yeah, man.

164
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:55,002
I think someone's got a crush on you.

165
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,443
Yeah, the attendant. I thought so.

166
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,947
- No.
- Graham.

167
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,747
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh.

168
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,051
I'm getting the feeling it's mutual.
Am I wrong?

169
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,617
You know it's true!

170
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,288
- Do you mind?
- You do!

171
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,831
I think it's absolutely fabulous.

172
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:21,265
But don't go dicking her around,
because she's totally brilliant.

173
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,897
If you hurt her,
I'm going to have to kill you.

174
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,467
So my advice is that we have
an awesome time together.

175
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,103
You sort out whatever it is
going on between you and this

176
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,841
so-called girlfriend
you've allegedly got.

177
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:38,581
By the time we get to Cairns, we'll
find some freakishly hot man for me,

178
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:41,248
and we'll all, you know,
go crazy together, all right?

179
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,655
All right.

180
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,485
She's only a little one, isn't she?

181
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,360
I reckon I could break that
in half real quickly, eh?

182
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,499
Youse two'd be watching me.

183
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,573
Here comes yours now, mate.

184
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:05,444
What a place, huh?

185
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:08,177
Hey, uh... Hey, mate. Oi.

186
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,449
Oi. Hey, come here.
I got a question for ya.

187
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:15,855
All right. You keep that.

188
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,392
How're you going?

189
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,052
Hey, uh...

190
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,459
Me and me mates are gonna see

191
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,897
if your girlfriends would be interested
in a little bit of a gang bang.

192
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:35,475
We Just want to make sure
it's all right with you first.

193
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,242
Good on ya. Fuckhead.

194
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,413
Hey, what'd you say?

195
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,617
I said...

196
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,487
I said that's, um...

197
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:59,564
...a nice smile you got.

198
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:05,304
Bazza, don't be a dickhead.

199
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,912
See you later, sweetheart.

200
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,639
Bye.

201
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,048
Fucking assholes.

202
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,557
Bunch of morons. Honestly.

203
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:35,627
- Yeah. Forget about it, Ben.
- No, I should've smashed him.

204
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,470
I should've T'ai Chi'd his ass.

205
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,103
I'm serious.

206
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,793
The weather's shit.

207
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:11,396
Yeah. All of a sudden.

208
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:14,205
I think it's the start
of the wet season, so...

209
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:17,779
That's beautiful
over there, isn't it?

210
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:21,339
That light coming up through
the mountains. It's gorgeous.

211
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:24,644
I hope it doesn't rain.

212
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,749
what?

213
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:30,053
- I said I hope it doesn't rain.
- Man, it's gonna be cold tonight.

214
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:32,651
I mean cold.

215
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,059
Great.

216
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,537
Hey, I think that's the start of it.

217
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:49,476
So it's in there?
You've got to climb over the top?

218
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:51,012
Um, yeah.

219
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:52,842
Aw!

220
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,906
- What was that?
- Rock.

221
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:01,179
There's Just nothing out here.

222
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,191
I know. It's great.

223
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:08,589
Here we go.
Wolf Creek Crater!

224
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,996
- Crater! We're here!
- Whoo!

225
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,261
"Walking trail."

226
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:15,462
- "Allow, three... Three hours."
- Three hours?

227
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,065
Is that three hours to get all the way
to the middle or to get up to the top?

228
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,939
- I imagine it's to the top.
- It's to the top.

229
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,241
No camping. Hiking's allowed.

230
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:27,282
Put rubbish in your bin
and no fires. OK.

231
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,544
Right. Great. Let's go.

232
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:32,112
- Wow. Madame.
- Thank you.

233
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:35,885
- Wolf Creek awaits you.
- Oh, wow!

234
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,949
Wolf Creek!

235
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:41,057
Wow.

236
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,669
It's a souvenir...

237
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:57,612
What is with this weather?

238
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,440
- Maybe we should take an umbrella.
- Yeah.

239
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,452
Yeah, definitely.

240
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,078
What do you want to take?

241
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:09,147
- All of it.
- All what's in the Esky.

242
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:12,422
- And who's carrying all of this?
- You are.

243
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:15,589
- Just all of it.
- All right, three hours.

244
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:18,430
- Let's do it!
- Let's go.

245
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,092
Oh, wait.

246
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:25,237
Oh, there's poo everywhere!

247
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:28,299
Yay! We're on the poo planet.

248
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:38,309
There's another skull. Look.

249
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:40,548
They're bones!

250
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:43,615
Oh, my God, there's bones everywhere!

251
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:54,959
What are you doing?
It's not raining that bad.

252
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:58,063
Yeah, it is.
It's freezing. I've got no Jumper.

253
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,268
- Where did the meteorite go?
- It's in the middle.

254
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,138
- Just went into the ground?
- Yeah.

255
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:09,082
Look how good it looks. Coo-ooh!

256
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,045
Come on!

257
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,984
Whoo!

258
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,117
Here.

259
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:21,720
You all right?

260
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:35,840
Wow. That's impressive.

261
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,678
You're looking at one of the
biggest meteorite craters on the planet.

262
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,876
They reckon the explosion
from the impact

263
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:47,252
would've been like 200 nuclear bombs
going off at the same time.

264
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:52,122
Some guys discovered it
scouting for an oil company in 1947.

265
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,561
Imagine being
the first person to see it.

266
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,671
Hey. Let's go.

267
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,185
You all right?

268
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,199
- This is great, Ben.
- Yeah. Thank you.

269
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:33,599
It's fantastic. Thank you.

270
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,660
Such a sweetheart, aren't you?

271
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,400
Loving it.

272
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:41,500
Yeah. It's great.

273
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,272
Sorry. I didn't know.

274
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,982
It'll clear.
Give it a couple of hours.

275
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:53,054
Thank you.

276
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:01,696
Back soon.

277
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,761
Where are you going?

278
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:26,745
I wonder why the meteor hit here.

279
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:32,026
In this place. Nowhere else.

280
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:42,803
Maybe it was drawn
to something in the Earth.

281
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:47,835
- Like when lightning strikes.
- Hmm.

282
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:51,644
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

283
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:08,896
- Hi.
- Hey.

284
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,925
That's awesome.

285
00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:13,657
I was wondering what
that would be like.

286
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:27,909
Kris, what's the time?

287
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,968
Uh, don't know.
Watch has stopped.

288
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,881
It's like Niagara Falls!

289
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:35,177
Whoo!

290
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:41,281
- Hey, have you got the time?
- Nah. It's busted.

291
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:46,087
I'd say it's about 7:00.
So about an hour till dark.

292
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,152
We'll make it back to Halls Creek, easy.

293
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,460
Kristy's watch stopped too.

294
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,501
- Bullshit. Did it really?
- Yeah.

295
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:58,734
6:30. Mine too.

296
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:00,775
What, batteries or something?

297
00:30:01,877 --> 00:30:04,004
You got the keys?

298
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,610
Make sure you warm her up first.

299
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:18,118
- It's weird weather, eh?
- Yeah, I reckon. God.

300
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:22,286
See you later, Wolf Creek.

301
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,102
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

302
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:39,780
Did we leave the lights on?

303
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,476
No.

304
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,815
Is it... Is it in gear?

305
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:48,914
No. Try... Try again.

306
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:51,118
Fuck.

307
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:55,229
OK.

308
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:58,460
Shit.

309
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,658
Uh, pop... Pop the hood.

310
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,000
It's probably Just
the battery terminals.

311
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:16,683
This one...

312
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:23,314
Do you know what you're looking for?

313
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,765
Oh...

314
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:36,495
Are you gonna tell Liz?

315
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:39,302
I've got a feeling
she already knows.

316
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:42,468
I'll go see what I can do.

317
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:47,405
Did you hear that?

318
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:52,546
- You didn't leave the lights on?
- No.

319
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,384
No.

320
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:03,792
Fucker.

321
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,524
Looks like we might be
spending the night.

322
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,669
This is fucked.

323
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,538
Bitch.

324
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:45,833
I am your father.

325
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:04,423
Do you think it means anything?

326
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:12,399
I mean, the watches
and the car not working.

327
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:17,169
- What do you mean?
- Well...

328
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:22,404
You know the stories I was telling you
last night about the UFOs and stuff.

329
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,969
And when they were around,

330
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:29,808
well, things stopped working.

331
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,754
Could be the same kind of thing.

332
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:37,622
Ben, I really don't think we need to be
talking about that right now.

333
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,255
OK.

334
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,500
There's something out there.

335
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:55,567
- And it ain't no man.
- No, no. I saw some lights.

336
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:59,408
- Where?
- Right... Right there.

337
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:02,075
- There.
- What the hell?

338
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,880
No, no, no.
Don't fucking... What?

339
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,615
- It might be a car!
- Well, it might not be a car!

340
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,652
- That don't look like no car.
- Shit. It's coming this way.

341
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:14,457
Fuck, it is coming this way. Shit.

342
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:17,123
- Fuck!
- Fuck. It is coming this way.

343
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,030
- Should we run?
- No, no, no!

344
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,331
Just stay in the car! Don't move.

345
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,473
Hold on.
Hang on, it's a car.

346
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:36,210
How do you know?

347
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,718
It's a bloody car! Shit!

348
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,688
I can hear the engine.

349
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,775
What the bloody hell
are you mob doing out here?

350
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,778
Scared the shit out of me.

351
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,980
We thought it was aliens.

352
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:12,754
- Well, she did.
- Hi.

353
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:15,985
It was pissing down with rain earlier.
I was Just about to chuck it in.

354
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:18,890
Lucky for you mob I decided to
hang around a bit longer, eh?

355
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,690
Yeah. We were Just getting
ready to spend the night too.

356
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:25,824
Ah, well. We'll get you
outta here quick smart.

357
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:28,563
Come on, you bloody sparkplug!

358
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:31,435
Where ya heading?

359
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,599
- Darwin, sort of.
- Yeah, then on to Cairns.

360
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:36,041
- That's where we're really headed.
- Long drive.

361
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,806
- Yeah.
- It's too long.

362
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:39,574
- British, are youse?
- Yeah.

363
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,139
- That's right.
- Ben's an Aussie, though.

364
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:45,084
- Yeah? Where ya from, mate?
- Sydney.

365
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:47,815
Poofta capital of Australia.

366
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,222
Just playing with you, tiger.

367
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,318
Never been over there myself.

368
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:55,761
Lucky you sheila's
are traveling with a bloke.

369
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:57,264
Can't be too careful.

370
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:02,001
- Ooh!
- Nothing wrong with the battery.

371
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:06,499
- I told you we'd be all right.
- I know. He's hilarious.

372
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:09,544
He's like one of those guys
from the outback Australia shows.

373
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:11,442
- Yeah!
- Like Crocodile Dundee.

374
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,242
He's a pisser.

375
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:15,749
You're an Aussie.
How come you don't talk like him?

376
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:18,843
You want the bad news?
Or the really bad news?

377
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:22,919
Well, your coil's rooted.
Cactus. You're not going nowhere.

378
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:25,653
- What can we do?
- Fuck. I had it totally checked...

379
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,355
- Ben. Fuck.
- Must be something we can do.

380
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,389
You take the old one out,
bung the new one in, Bob's your sister.

381
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,664
The only good news is
I got the gear to do it.

382
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,467
Problem is, it's back at my camp
Just down the road a ways.

383
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,201
I'm going back down there anyway,

384
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,073
so I could give you a tow,
fix it tonight.

385
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:45,135
Probably have you
on the road by morning.

386
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:47,545
Otherwise, someone'll
be coming through here.

387
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:49,174
Eventually.

388
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:52,550
Make up your mind,
'cause I gotta get a rattle on.

389
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:54,486
- Thank you
- Thank you.

390
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,189
- What do you guys want to do?
- Might as well.

391
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,126
He's not going to fix it
for free, is he?

392
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,790
What if he wants a couple hundred
pounds or something?

393
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:06,834
- A thousand, what? I don't know.
- OK, OK.

394
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:10,235
OK, first we gotta find out
if he wants any money or not.

395
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:12,933
- I don't have a lot of cash on me.
- Me, neither.

396
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,669
Nor do I.

397
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,437
Duh.

398
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:22,344
Why don't we get him to tow us to town,
and we'll get someone there?

399
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,406
Yeah.

400
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:28,546
- OK.
- Go on.

401
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:31,990
- You go on, you ask him.
- I don't want to.

402
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,857
Go on. It's a bloke thing. Go on.

403
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:35,487
Yeah, you must. Please?

404
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:36,997
- Yeah.
- It's a bloke thing.

405
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,530
Ask him.

406
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:48,708
- You didn't need any help?
- Nah, I'm all right. Thanks, though.

407
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:51,211
Certain way of putting it in.

408
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:56,783
Um, I know it's a long way,
but the girls were wondering

409
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:58,512
if you could tow us back into town.

410
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:01,613
I mean, we don't wanna put you out
any more than we already have.

411
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,624
Look, I'd really like to help you, mate,

412
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,557
but I'm not heading
that way, you know?

413
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:09,085
If you don't want the lift,
that's up to you, but I'm heading south.

414
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,064
- South.
- Yeah, south.

415
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:12,394
South.

416
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,697
- You wanna go north.
- Yeah.

417
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,930
I'm heading south.

418
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:20,806
Yeah.

419
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,400
- Bit of a bugger.
- Bugger. Yeah.

420
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:27,077
So, um...

421
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:34,048
- Well, with that coil...
- Yeah?

422
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:35,316
...and stuff...

423
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:40,552
How much would that cost,
say if we Just got you to do that?

424
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:42,460
It's not fuckin' Pitt street, mate!

425
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,499
Of course I'm not gonna charge you,
you stupid bastard! Hey?

426
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:49,697
You hear that?
"How much?"

427
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,767
Hey?

428
00:38:57,512 --> 00:39:01,175
- Oh, you sure?
- Oh, Jesus, you make me laugh.

429
00:39:02,684 --> 00:39:04,982
You must keep the little buggers
amused, hey?

430
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,179
Yeah.

431
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:09,485
You amuse the bloody
bejesus out of me.

432
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,454
All right. I'll get the girls going.

433
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,994
- That'd be a good idea.
- Yeah, good idea.

434
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,689
- Off you go.
- Off I go.

435
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:17,459
Yay.

436
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,359
All right.

437
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:12,634
Where did he say his place was again?

438
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,973
South.

439
00:42:15,044 --> 00:42:17,478
It feels like we've been
driving for hours.

440
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:21,240
We shouldn't be too far.

441
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:23,683
That's what you said an hour ago.

442
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:27,120
OK, let's Just get him
to drop us off here then, all right?

443
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:33,693
It's cool.

444
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:36,288
He said it was gonna be
a bit of a drive, didn't he?

445
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:37,628
Mm-hmm.

446
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,597
It's cool.

447
00:43:42,198 --> 00:43:44,860
Must be some sort of mining operation.

448
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:47,767
Hmm. Looks like a ghost town.

449
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:18,032
- We're here.
- Thank God.

450
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,465
Wherever here is.

451
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:29,905
- I have plenty of water there.
- Aw, thank you.

452
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:32,504
It's the one thing
that we don't have plenty of.

453
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:33,981
Cheers.

454
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,144
Nothing like rainwater
from the top end.

455
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,313
Hey, Mick, this place is amazing.

456
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:42,516
I can't believe they Just walked out
and left all this stuff here.

457
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,186
Plenty of places like this
all over the outback.

458
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:48,458
Thousands of 'em.
Places people've forgotten about.

459
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:50,863
Must be a whole town
out there somewhere.

460
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:53,731
Got lost in a six-month
dust storm back in the '40s.

461
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:56,203
The people Just walked away.

462
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:59,002
I heard of blokes gettin' lost
on their own farms.

463
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,702
Just never found their way out.

464
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,403
- On their own property?
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:45:02,478 --> 00:45:03,467
That's amazing.

466
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:06,447
Oh, there's one up here
that crosses three states, right?

467
00:45:06,516 --> 00:45:09,280
- Takes six days to drive across.
- No!

468
00:45:09,352 --> 00:45:11,479
I... I... We used to
work out there once.

469
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:14,022
- What'd you do there?
- Head shooter.

470
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,853
You know, clearin' vermin.

471
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:18,985
Roos, horses, pigs, buffalo.
You name it.

472
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:20,460
Don't work there no more.

473
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:26,229
Use poisons.
You know, instead of shooters.

474
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:30,136
Yeah, used to... used to fly in
with the helicopters.

475
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:33,232
You fly in low
over a herd of water buffalo.

476
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:36,142
Sometimes take out 50 head
in an afternoon.

477
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:40,740
I wore out five bolts
on a.303 one year.

478
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:44,213
Pigs. Pigs were different.
You have to get in close.

479
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:46,983
Get the dogs onto 'em,
and then you go in with a knife.

480
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:51,049
You had to get in under him, you know,
while the pig's fighting off the dogs.

481
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:52,424
And you had to be quick.

482
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:54,656
Otherwise, you'd lose
your guts on its tusk.

483
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,925
Sharp!

484
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:59,229
I seen a big boar pig, right?

485
00:45:59,302 --> 00:46:02,703
Take a pitbull's head
clean off one time.

486
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,667
Little legs still pumpin' away.

487
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:08,869
Oh!

488
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:10,776
- Fair dinkum.
- Fair dinkum?

489
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:13,246
That's what I said, yeah.

490
00:46:13,316 --> 00:46:15,181
Fair dinkum.

491
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:18,118
Wow. Poor little fella.

492
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:26,350
- So, um, where do you live?
- Oh, I get around, you know.

493
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:29,398
Never know where I might pop up.

494
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,903
- Man, you must love the freedom.
- What?

495
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:40,067
The freedom.
You know, you must love it.

496
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:43,375
You know, hangin' out
in nature and shit.

497
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,914
- Right.
- Yeah.

498
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:50,817
You get to, like,
you know, cruise around the bush.

499
00:46:50,886 --> 00:46:56,483
Saying cool stuff like,
"that's not a knife, this is a knife."

500
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:01,962
You know
what I'm talking about? Yeah?

501
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,473
What do you actually do... now?

502
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:23,051
Oh, I could tell ya,
but then I'd have to kill ya.

503
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:36,029
So you don't really
shoot kangaroos, do you?

504
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:39,556
I'm doing people a service
by taking out a few roos.

505
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,728
They're everywhere out here now.

506
00:47:41,804 --> 00:47:43,601
Like tourists.

507
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:58,714
Oh. Excusez moi.

508
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:02,923
Oi.

509
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:05,483
Oi. Your turn.

510
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,232
Fair go.

511
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:18,830
Bloody women here, son.

512
00:48:25,414 --> 00:48:29,180
Well, um, I'll let you know when
I get it goin'. What do ya reckon?

513
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:31,719
- Thank you.
- No worries.

514
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,381
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

515
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,451
"But then I'd have to kill ya."

516
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:42,557
Shh.

517
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,055
What?

518
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:46,999
Did you see the way
he was looking at you?

519
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:49,833
He's trying to impress us
with his great white hunter thing.

520
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:52,999
But he's doing us a favor.
He probably doesn't appreciate us

521
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:55,475
cracking Jokes at his expense.
Seriously.

522
00:48:57,046 --> 00:48:59,844
- Let's get the car fixed.
- That's what we're doing.

523
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:01,610
Don't freak out.

524
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:18,099
- You all right?
- Fine, thanks.

525
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:22,361
Thanks again for helping us out.

526
00:49:22,505 --> 00:49:24,063
No worries.

527
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:30,203
Obviously, it'd be great
to get going as soon as possible.

528
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,046
No worries.

529
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,207
Ben.

530
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:12,220
Ben, move the Esky
away from the fire.

531
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,481
Ben.

532
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:41,976
Oh!

533
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:08,441
No!

534
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:11,453
No! Aah!

535
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,954
Please don't kill me.

536
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:27,290
Please.

537
00:56:27,363 --> 00:56:31,026
Please! Aah!

538
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:35,360
Please!

539
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,831
Don't kill me! Please!

540
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:40,967
No!

541
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:43,477
Don't kill me!

542
00:56:49,218 --> 00:56:50,276
Bang!

543
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,122
Well, nothing happens
when the bolt's open, you see?

544
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:05,126
Uh-oh!

545
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,710
The look on your fuckin' face!

546
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:24,844
Why are you doing this?

547
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,821
Why?

548
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:29,790
Please! If you let me go,
I won't tell anyone.

549
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:32,157
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I won't! I won't!

550
00:57:32,228 --> 00:57:34,389
Come on. Calm down.

551
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,226
Listen to Uncle Michael.

552
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,563
Come on.

553
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:41,034

00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:50,108
Fuck you!

557
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,510
Mmm.

00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,106
Mmm!

559
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,612
Mmm!

00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:18,336
Fuck you, cunt!

00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:28,012
Fuck you, cunt!

You fucking loser!

00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:32,482
You fucking loser.

568
00:58:32,555 --> 00:58:34,216
Thank you very much.

569
00:58:36,192 --> 00:58:37,784
You know...

570
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,524
You know how I know
that you're not gonna tell nobody?

571
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:43,792
You know how I know?

572
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:48,231
No! No!

573
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:53,098
Off with your little pinkies.

574
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:16,597
Fuck!

575
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:41,680
Ah!

576
00:59:41,757 --> 00:59:44,225
Jesus Christ, Mick!

577
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,818
Rule number one.
Put the bloody fire out.

578
00:59:46,896 --> 00:59:48,158
For fuck's sake!

579
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,993
Bloody hell!

580
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:10,518
Shh! Kristy!

581
01:00:10,586 --> 01:00:13,214
Shh! Shh!

582
01:00:13,289 --> 01:00:15,257
Please! Shh!

583
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,662
Shh! Shh!

584
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,699
Where's Ben?
Where's Ben?

585
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:26,360
Shh. Kristy, you have to be quiet.

586
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:37,304
Shh!

587
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:45,577
Oh. You're still awake, are ya?

588
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:48,122
You know, a man's a real goose, eh?

589
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,452
I mean, it took four hours

590
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:51,891
to get those fuckin' parts
out of your car, right?

591
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:53,895
Now the bastard thing's all burnt.

592
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:56,124
What do ya think of that?

593
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:02,262
Bloody this, all.

594
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,467
Now...

595
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:11,606
Where were we?

596
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:13,843
Eh?

597
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,508
Oh, yeah.

598
01:01:18,854 --> 01:01:21,254
Let's play. Hey?

599
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:40,899
You like to play, don't ya?

600
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:43,308
You like to play, hey?
Hey? Hey?

601
01:01:43,379 --> 01:01:45,973
You like to play, do ya?
Hey? Hey?

602
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,851
That stupid bitch over there.
See that stupid bitch over there?

603
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,149
She loved it.

604
01:01:54,824 --> 01:01:57,554
While she lasted.
Good few months.

605
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,423
We were great together, you know?

606
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:01,087
Till she lost her head!

607
01:02:06,902 --> 01:02:08,995
How about...

608
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:11,437
How about I cut your tits off, hey?

609
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,099
Cut your tits off.

610
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:17,805
You're all the same,
you foreign cunts.

611
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,474
Weak as piss.

612
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,552
Now, how the hell did you get out?

613
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:34,423
You're wasting your time, eh?

614
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:38,364
It's not loaded.
I only put one up the spout.

615
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:40,800
Let her go.

616
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,802
Now!

617
01:02:45,808 --> 01:02:47,366
Get away from her!

618
01:02:47,443 --> 01:02:48,933
Now!

619
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:50,308
Now, Lizzy.

620
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:54,338
Now, a rifle in the wrong hands can be,
you know, really dangerous.

621
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,782
So, give me the fuckin'...

622
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:09,188
Kill him!

623
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:17,505
Kill him!

624
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:23,436
No!

625
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:45,694
Please help me.

626
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:06,682
Come on.

627
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:23,567
No! No!

628
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:25,129
Where are you going?

629
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:26,902
Where are you going?

630
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:28,944
Don't go!

631
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:11,749
Yes!

632
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:39,444
Hang onto something!

633
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,025
Go!

634
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:45,803
Come on!

635
01:06:51,186 --> 01:06:53,211
Go, go, go, Liz!

636
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:04,862
Go, go!

637
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:47,141
Come on.

638
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,214
- Push!
- What?

639
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:55,807
He'll see the lights go over!

640
01:08:28,383 --> 01:08:32,786
- Follow me.
- Are you Joking?

641
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:33,843
Come on.

642
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:06,013
He's going to check on us.

643
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:07,571
Let's go.

644
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,759
Fuck!

645
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:23,993
He killed that person back there.

646
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:25,761
Did you see Ben?

647
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,993
She'd been alive for months.

648
01:10:29,738 --> 01:10:32,206
We've got to move.

649
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:36,040
- He's going to do that to us.
- We can't go that way.

650
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,171
- He's gonna see we're not down there.
- I know, I know!

651
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:42,909
I've got a set of keys.

652
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:45,418
- He must have more cars.
- I'm not going back there.

653
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:48,388
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere.
We need a car.

654
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:54,323
Come on.

655
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:21,684
Wait. Wait.

656
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:23,984
- Wait.
- You all right?

657
01:11:24,059 --> 01:11:26,220
I Just gotta catch my breath. Wait.

658
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:28,491
- You OK?
- Yeah.

659
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:30,224
It's all right. It's all right.

660
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:38,072
Listen, Kris.

661
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,041
You're Just gonna have to wait
here for a minute, all right?

662
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:42,201
No!

663
01:11:42,277 --> 01:11:45,110
- No!
- Listen, it's Just for five minutes.

664
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,273
- Please, don't leave me. Please!
- Listen.

665
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,045
- What if he catches me again?
- He won't, he won't.

666
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:51,585
Please, don't leave me!

667
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:54,713
He's not going to
catch you again, all right?

668
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,224
You Just have to wait here
for five minutes, OK?

669
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,954
I'll be in and out.
I'll be quicker on my own, OK?

670
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:01,188
Listen.

671
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:04,721
Look...

672
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:07,795
If I'm not back, all right,
in five minutes,

673
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,565
Just head that way, OK?

674
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:12,903
And you'll hit a road
eventually, all right?

675
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:15,204
I'll catch up with you.

676
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,577
OK. I'm quicker on my own.
All right? I'm coming back.

677
01:12:18,647 --> 01:12:20,444
- OK?
- Wait.

678
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:21,743
- Please.
- Five minutes.

679
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:23,182
It's OK.
It's all right.

680
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:26,911
- Don't go!
- It's all right.

681
01:12:26,988 --> 01:12:29,115
What if he catches me again?

682
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:30,681
He's not...
He's not gonna...

683
01:12:30,759 --> 01:12:33,057
He's not gonna catch you again,
all right?

684
01:12:33,128 --> 01:12:34,493
Listen.

685
01:12:35,597 --> 01:12:38,589
Listen, you Just wait here, all right?

686
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:42,068
Please hurry.

687
01:13:14,736 --> 01:13:16,397
Ben?

688
01:15:25,867 --> 01:15:26,959
Ben.

689
01:15:39,214 --> 01:15:41,910
It's excellent.
Yeah, I've never seen better.

690
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:44,782
Bella, bella, bellal

691
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:47,788
I'm sure we did.
I thought we got this fixed.

692
01:15:47,856 --> 01:15:52,020
Honey, I'm not in the mood, all right?

693
01:15:54,129 --> 01:15:57,496
- How's it going, mate?
- Not too good.

694
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:01,432
What do you expect?

695
01:16:01,503 --> 01:16:03,664
He's from the country.
That's what happens.

696
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:05,604
Country people are friendly, though.

697
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:10,273
- Thirsty, are ya?
- Yeah.

698
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:14,578
Eh? Nothing like rainwater
from the top end.

699
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,329
So far, no sign
of intelligent life forms.

700
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:37,599
Um, do you wanna say hello?

701
01:16:37,673 --> 01:16:39,436
- Righto. What's your name?
- Graham.

702
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:41,533
Graham.
Nice to meet you, Graham.

703
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,804
I'm Ben.

704
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:45,073
- This one too?
- Yeah, man.

705
01:17:44,973 --> 01:17:47,635
Ah!

706
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:05,917
Hey.

707
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,824
Like your little mate said before,
you know.

708
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:11,695
That's not a knife.

709
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:14,861
This is a knife.

710
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,740
Now, come on.
Come on, Lizzie.

711
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,038
Come on!

712
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,374
Settle down, you know.

713
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:26,812
That's not gonna kill ya. All right?

714
01:18:26,882 --> 01:18:30,318
I got a bullet hole in me neck
and I'm not whingeing, am I? No.

715
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:34,653
I'm gonna have to do something, Lizzy.

716
01:18:34,723 --> 01:18:38,215
So as you don't try
and run out on me, you know?

717
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:41,888
It's... It's a little trick they used to
use in the Vietnam War, you know?

718
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:43,363
So they could take prisoners

719
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,992
and they still get the same
information out of 'em.

720
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:48,764
But the little buggers didn't escape.
You with me?

721
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:50,566
You with me?

722
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:52,897
You see what I mean? Eh?

723
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:56,102
No! No!

724
01:18:58,647 --> 01:19:00,342
Now that!

725
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:03,407
That's for fuckin' wreckin'
me fuckin' truck, you bitch!

726
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:12,893
Now, this little procedure...

727
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:16,993
...is called "making a head on a stick."

728
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:21,168
Because once your
spine's severed, right...

729
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,794
No!

730
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:29,310
That's what you are, hey?

731
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:33,443
Head on a stick.

732
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:36,951
Now...

733
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:41,212
Let's talk about your little mate,
um, Kristy.

734
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:50,721
Liz.

735
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:56,093
Liz.

736
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,017
What happened?

737
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:32,413
Jesus.

738
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,924
I'll get a blanket.
Get you some help.

739
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,855
No! No!

740
01:23:50,802 --> 01:23:51,860
Oh!

741
01:24:32,009 --> 01:24:34,102
Come on! Move!

742
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:47,623
Come on! Come on!

743
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:54,591
Come on! Fucking move!

744
01:24:54,866 --> 01:24:57,767
Move! Come on! Fuck!

745
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:05,709
Come on!

746
01:25:05,776 --> 01:25:09,769
No! No, no!

747
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:13,550
No.

748
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:28,596
Fuck you! Fuck you!

749
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:29,997
Asshole!

750
01:25:31,469 --> 01:25:33,403
Oh, fuck! No!

751
01:26:17,815 --> 01:26:20,215
The winner!

752
01:31:22,887 --> 01:31:25,287
Help!

753
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,755
{{{ the end }}}
