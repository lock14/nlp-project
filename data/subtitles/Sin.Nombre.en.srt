00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:12,635
Miss.

2
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,763
What do you want?

3
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,223
I told you not to come here to bother Benito.

4
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:19,850
Benito!!

5
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:24,187
You are a criminal and my
baby won't be a criminal like you.

6
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,815
Benito is not coming out!!!

7
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,610
Or I'll call the police to take you to jail,
that's what you want, you asshole.

8
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,611
Grandma.

9
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,906
You shut up and go back inside!

10
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,910
You aren't going out I told you,
don't you understand spanish

11
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,717
Let this be our secret my friend...

12
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:02,011
...keep the secret here, ok?

13
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,851
Lil' Mago ( Magician ) wants to see you.

14
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:25,864
One...

15
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,954
Two...

16
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,542
Three...

17
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,252
Four...

18
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,465
Five...

19
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,427
Six...

20
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,138
Seven...

21
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,931
Eight...

22
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:56,850
Nine...

23
00:03:58,852 --> 00:03:59,643
Ten...

24
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,229
Eleven...

25
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:04,440
Twelve...

26
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,736
Twelve...

27
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:14,031
Twelve... Twelve...

28
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:18,660
...Thirteen.

29
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,972
Congratulations little Homie!

30
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:51,229
Casper, look at the kids smile.

31
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,902
The gang who controls "Salvatrucha" gang.

32
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,207
Your dad is waiting for you.

33
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,169
Look, I know why you
want to do this trip, but...

34
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,673
...I don't know why I have to do it.

35
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,344
If you don't want to go,
grandma can not make you go, but...

36
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,346
...my brother won't come back for you again.

37
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:37,435
Look, I don't need anyone, I can go
to the north by myself if I wanted to.

38
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:46,360
Come with us, it won't be easy over
there, but at least we will be together.

39
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,239
There is nothing for you here, Sayra.

40
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:53,449
Nothing.

41
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:12,007
She is here.

42
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:21,890
Damn, if I didn't know I wouldn't recognize her.

43
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,983
She is a lady now.

44
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,986
Now you can recover your lost time.

45
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:39,448
We will do that on the way mother.

46
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:45,036
Tomorrow before sunrise we will grab the bus.

47
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,996
Don't worry, she will be ready.

48
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:57,254
"The Bombilla" Tapachula, Southern Mexico.

49
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,424
Here is Lucrecia with her products.

50
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:06,554
Casper, how have you been, now you
are a pederast?, the smaller the more idiots.

51
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:09,973
Look how you beat him up, you are a barbarian.

52
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,185
Tortillas, coffee, baleadas,soups!!!

53
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,531
Thank you!

54
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,449
Slow baby, slow..

55
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,211
Stop it.

56
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,268
Martha Marlene.

57
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,397
I am bored.

58
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:45,398
why?

59
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,817
Can you take me somewhere?

60
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,403
Where do you want to go?

61
00:09:52,071 --> 00:10:00,370
I don't know, wherever you want to,
where you go when you are not here.

62
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,958
You have another girl in your neighborhood, right?

63
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,209
Of course not.

64
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:11,504
You better not, because if I
realize that you have other girl......

65
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,552
What?

66
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,137
It shrinked...

67
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,140
Oh, it's normal, look...

68
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,643
...now it will be refreshed.

69
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,272
Do you think she will have a friend for me?

70
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,987
Be careful my friend "Smiley"...

71
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,739
...don't say anything that
we left from the "Bombilla"

72
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,701
Don't say anything at all,
so Lil' Mago won't notice.

73
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:47,451
Ok?

74
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,036
Yes.

75
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:50,829
Not a fucking word!

76
00:10:56,042 --> 00:11:01,797
Little Homie, you will first earn your letters,
hitting on a "Kiddo" (rival gangster)...

77
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:07,302
...then after that, you will conquer a girl.

78
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:14,099
Welcome to the destroyer.

79
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,102
- What's up, homie?
- Cool, brother.

80
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,070
What's up Casper you dog!

81
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,282
What, did he kill a "kiddo" yet, uh?

82
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,830
This is the "Naughty" and the "Smoky"...

83
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:45,418
...they just arrived, they come and
go to see what's going on here.

84
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,462
They are "Guanacos".
Are you thirsty?

85
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,565
This guy is "gold" we call him "the buttocks"...

86
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,402
...and this is the "Querubin".

87
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,408
He can't sit , his ass is bleeding...

88
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,329
...he has hemorroids.

89
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:49,430
This you have to earn it...
for the moment you have to share.

90
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,058
What's for the gang is for the gang.

91
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:04,443
He is the one that has the second voice.

92
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:08,656
Hey, my dogs are here.

93
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,327
How was it?

94
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,037
Did you go to the "Bombilla"?

95
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,792
Yes, but we didn't find anything.

96
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,092
The "Sol" found him with
another group of "chickens"...

97
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:34,177
...in the "Bombilla".

98
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,847
Take him out.

99
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,436
Don't worry, nothing is happening,
now that dog that scares you will die.

100
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:57,239
You fucked up "Kiddo",
you got in the train of the gang.

101
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,245
I'm only going to the north, please, please!!

102
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:09,207
You are already worthless you fucker...

103
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:14,295
...we will cut you in 18 pieces
and we will feed the dogs.

104
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:19,633
I have a family...
and I'm not a gangster anymore.

105
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:29,642
"kiddo" will always be a "kiddo"

106
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:36,272
Casper, give "Smiley" a hand.

107
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,609
Both of you, get him.

108
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,746
Point to his head.

109
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:56,498
This is for the fallen Homies, you fucker.

110
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,208
To the count of three...

111
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,918
One...

112
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:01,418
Two...

113
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,003
...Three.

114
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:32,737
The first time is like this
little Homie, don't chicken out.

115
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:40,369
The scareness goes away,
but the gang is forever.

116
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:48,543
Now you belong to a family
with thousands of brothers...

117
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:54,715
...wherever you go, there will
always be someone that protects you

118
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:03,930
Food is here!!

119
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,990
You were not in the "Bombilla" today.

120
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,534
The "Sol" didn't see you.

121
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:33,414
I was there the whole day,
and I didn't see him neither.

122
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,169
You are not playing gay, right Homie?

123
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:46,759
It has been many times already,
now the "Sol" didn't see you.

124
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,473
Forget what I said Homie...

125
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,644
...the homies are getting altered.

126
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,522
I love you dog, from my heart.

127
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,112
3 days later.

128
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:19,913
908 555 0187... again.

129
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,459
we learned it already.

130
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:26,835
repeat it.

131
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,294
I told you we learned it already.

132
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:33,967
you have to learn that number, if something
goes wrong, Yessenia can help you out.

133
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,886
Horacio, how much time left man?

134
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,472
Around 6 hours.

135
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:42,598
Are you tired?

136
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:44,058
Yes.

137
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:51,439
You have to see it as an adventure brother,
we are going to an adventure.

138
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:56,735
repeat the number one more time.

139
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:19,630
Guatemala-México Border.

140
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,358
Welcome to México.

141
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,277
Your documents.

142
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:48,155
You don't have, right?
everyone come this way.

143
00:18:56,746 --> 00:19:01,416
First you are going to empty your pockets
and take out everything that has some value...

144
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:07,796
...after that, take off your clothes and put it
in front of you... start with the shoes.

145
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,928
We walked too much!

146
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,514
We need to buy some water for her...

147
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,265
With what money?

148
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:18,732
Bring two big bottles.

149
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:38,624
Your second toe is bigger than the others...

150
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,544
...that means you run fast.

151
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:57,557
This is what we have walked today.

152
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:02,270
If there is no immigration
we will be here in two weeks.

153
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,480
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

154
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,068
Where is New Jersey?

155
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,906
It's not in the map.

156
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:22,204
Look, not even half of them will arrive to the U.S.

157
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,543
...but we are going to get there.

158
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:41,637
Yessenia is not as pretty as your Mom was...

159
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:45,181
...but she has a big heart.

160
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,475
The girls are beautiful.

161
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,067
Keep it, now they are your family also.

162
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,610
I don't want a picture of your family.

163
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:07,200
You are taking me in this trip,
and I thank you for that.

164
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,378
I will go call home.

165
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:38,894
Look at him,
I remember him more handsome.

166
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,397
No, the handsome one in the family is me.

167
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,655
Don't tell me you are not a little happy.

168
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,866
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.

169
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:57,034
- Don't think in that bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

170
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,035
Do you see that train?

171
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:54,417
That's our train, what do you say if
we grab it and go all the way to Texas?

172
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:58,462
I can take you to six flags.

173
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:12,098
Tell me one more time that you love me.

174
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,935
I love you.

175
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:19,355
Tell me that you won't hide me anymore.

176
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,149
It's not that.

177
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,527
Of course, you hide from me.

178
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:30,865
You already know all that is worth it.

179
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,451
Martha Marlene.

180
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:37,246
Martha Marlene.

181
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:47,337
You think I don't realize what you
do the whole day with your friends?

182
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:51,258
You get high with other girls,
and fool around the whole day.

183
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:53,092
Homies you two go to the trains.

184
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,058
Casper, Smiley.

185
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:03,685
What's up "Sol"?

186
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,523
What's up?

187
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:12,109
Who is this girl?

188
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:15,695
Martha Marlene, he is  the "Sol".

189
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,449
Is she your girl?

190
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,411
No, she is just a friend.

191
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:35,003
We have meeting tomorrow
at the cemetery, in the afternoon.

192
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:37,839
Be careful, ok?

193
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:50,766
Hey, be aware Homie,
the entrance is full of "kiddos"...

194
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:53,769
... who knows who is sneaking in with the people.

195
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:03,944
I'll take you home.

196
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,363
Friend..... you idiot.

197
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:10,366
Homie, wait here Smiley.

198
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:11,701
Wait for me.

199
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,976
Let's go.

200
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:57,709
There will be no train.

201
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:00,669
The train went off the rail ahead,
there were many dead people.

202
00:28:00,878 --> 00:28:02,004
Where did you hear that?

203
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:04,965
Some "Salvadorians" told me.

204
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:13,431
There will be no train!!!

205
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,297
We need more money to buy the
defense for the homies that are in jail.

206
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:56,300
finally, some Homies have
screwed up in their obligations...

207
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,928
...and the "kiddos" are getting in the territory.

208
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,265
We cannot allow those dogs bringing
their garbage in the neighborhood...

209
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:07,352
There will be "cut" for Casper and Smiley.

210
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:10,604
They fooled me...

211
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:15,901
...and you know that you cant lie to the leader....
worst, lie to the neighborhood.

212
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:19,654
Now I want to hear your version.

213
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,616
Where did you go after the "Bombilla"?

214
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:30,288
Smiley, where did you go?

215
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:36,085
Ok, your gun.

216
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:49,972
that's all.

217
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:53,724
"Salvatrucha" gang, the gang who
controls the "Salvatrucha" gang.

218
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:11,157
What are you doing here?

219
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:12,991
You have to go!

220
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,284
Now!

221
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,954
Why? is it a private party?

222
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:22,291
What's up Casper? who is this girl?

223
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,750
A friend.

224
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:25,085
From where?

225
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,087
I am from downtown.

226
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,966
Oh, sorry, I confused you.

227
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,384
I was going to take her to the exit.

228
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:34,551
No.

229
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:41,056
It won't take time Homie.

230
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,225
If you want I can take her...

231
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,896
...or she can stay and watch.

232
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,397
But you don't go anywhere Homie.

233
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,987
Take her directly to her house Homie.

234
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:21,467
13 seconds of cut for being a liar.

235
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,051
One...

236
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,638
Two...Three...

237
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:31,725
Smiley, you also have 13 seconds
for not saying anything against Casper.

238
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:44,361
This is the largest tree in Tapachula, if you
go to the top, you can see very far away.

239
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,241
Why Willie couldn't come?

240
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,033
Willie?

241
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,830
Do you refer to Casper?

242
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:04,503
Ohh, I get it now.

243
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:16,848
You are the reason for him being abscent.

244
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:22,686
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

245
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,944
Closer.

246
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,448
Closer.

247
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,037
Don't be shy, I won't bite you.

248
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:48,374
So...

249
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:54,463
...you and Casper are more than friends.

250
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,429
I have to go.

251
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:14,271
Has he told you anything about us?

252
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:27,033
Do you know what are the most
important rules to keep a friendship?

253
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:37,166
Honesty, respect, and generosity.

254
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:16,908
hey girl...

255
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,267
Where is Martha Marlene?

256
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,061
She left.

257
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:51,271
To her house?

258
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,734
The beast took her.

259
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,368
You will find another one.

260
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:33,182
We are going to make a trip to Tonala...

261
00:35:33,974 --> 00:35:35,976
...you and smiley will go with me.

262
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:45,276
Homie, one more thing...

263
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,656
...you lie to me again...

264
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:55,576
... and I will kill you myself.

265
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:08,545
Horacio, they already cleared the railway...

266
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,422
...the train goes this night thank god.

267
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,474
Give me the money!

268
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:44,480
Fast, fast!

269
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:15,716
give me the money!

270
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:22,555
Give him the money fast, fast.

271
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:26,558
That's enough!

272
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:44,699
Turn around!

273
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:47,576
Dad, Dad!!!

274
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,371
Smiley, get off the train!

275
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,373
but.. Casper.

276
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:44,917
Get off man!!!

277
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:50,380
Go Smiley, Go!!!

278
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,465
He is dangerous.

279
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,176
Are you ok?

280
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,427
He is not doing anything to us.

281
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:48,638
He is a gangster man.

282
00:42:50,766 --> 00:42:52,600
We have to knock him off the train.

283
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:56,655
Immigration!!!! immigration!!!!

284
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,799
Raise your spawn "Salvatrucha" gang.

285
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:37,940
Homies...

286
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:43,153
...we have to talk about Casper.

287
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:46,197
We should all go and get him at once.

288
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:50,701
No Homie, water is not ready for beans yet.

289
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,079
Much less with so many fucker around.

290
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:56,623
They can attack the neighborhood...

291
00:44:56,873 --> 00:45:03,004
...we have to run the voice, even we don't catch
him now, sooner or later the sun will light him

292
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:05,380
when that happens...

293
00:45:09,217 --> 00:45:12,511
I am not a sissy, that's why I returned.

294
00:45:16,724 --> 00:45:19,851
Then you are lucky I don't kill you smiley.

295
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,189
You seem not to have feelings
for the neighborhood, right?

296
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:31,445
If you didn't have the balls to kill Casper,
how do I know you didn't help him escape?

297
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:35,156
That's what happened right, you fucker?

298
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,241
I didn't do anything!!

299
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:43,914
I will dissapear you from
the neighborhood, you fucker!

300
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:53,713
Show me you are not a sissy, show me!!!

301
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:12,981
Send me, send me so I can show you
that I have feelings for the neighborhood.

302
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:20,653
Send me so I can look for him, and kill him.

303
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:36,417
Calm down "Sol", hold it, hold it man.

304
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:44,716
Get going now.

305
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:49,219
Go and kill  him if you want to stand out.

306
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:55,599
if you don't kill him, then don't even
dare to come back to the neighborhood.

307
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,357
Son of a bitch, he doesn't
even know where his dick is!!

308
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:09,903
We have to communicate it
to all the gangsters in L.A.

309
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:15,492
That dog cannot have even a shadow to hide!!

310
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,142
You going to die.

311
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:40,189
Thank you.

312
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,276
My name is Sayra.

313
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:58,038
I am Willie.

314
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,338
He killed Lil' Mago...

315
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,135
...he got warned, there is green light
to kill him, those are the rules.

316
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:17,013
And how are you going to kill him?

317
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:25,520
Wow!, thats so pretty! how many you got?

318
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:29,273
Enough to kill you all.

319
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:42,201
Kill him but hiding.

320
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:37,582
Sleep, I will stay awake.

321
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:46,651
You see, my family is very poor, we barely
had a little bit of beans to eat once in a while.

322
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:34,817
You are not going to wash yourself?

323
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:44,867
It feels good.

324
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:50,622
I don't know, maybe later.

325
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:56,294
When there is less people.

326
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:02,299
And what will you do later?

327
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:04,926
I don't know.

328
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,977
Will you stay here tonight?

329
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:29,947
If i find food around I will bring you later.

330
00:54:36,703 --> 00:54:38,538
What were you talking with him?

331
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:40,290
We can help him.

332
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:45,002
Are you crazy?
we have to stay away from him.

333
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:46,795
No, you don't understand.

334
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:50,632
He is a killer.

335
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:53,009
- He is in trouble.
- I am ordering you.

336
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,220
But he is in trouble!

337
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,099
I don't care about him, I care
about you and my brother Orlando.

338
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,187
Look, we still have a long way to get there.

339
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:15,362
We have to be aware, we
can't let anyone separate us, ok?

340
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:38,631
Who is the boss?

341
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:39,674
I am.

342
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,719
I am Smiley from the Confetti neighborhood.

343
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,767
Who is the boss now in the Confetti?

344
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,811
The "Sol".

345
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,398
we knew what happened...

346
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:02,527
...are you hungry or thirsty?

347
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,990
Have you ever got into one of those?

348
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,201
...me neither.

349
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:20,375
In a road heading to Texas, I saw
a factory where they build them.

350
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:25,422
There was a letter board,
very big, with the world shape...

351
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:28,424
...and it was shiny, so beautiful.

352
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:33,803
I wanted to get on it.

353
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:41,351
when I go through there, I will
see it and it will remind me of you.

354
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,437
If you make it all the way.

355
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:48,274
I will make it... I am sure.

356
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:54,863
In Tegus I went with my friend Clarissa,
to my neighbor's house...

357
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:57,699
...a crazy old lady called Leonor...

358
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:59,451
...she was a witch.

359
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:06,957
She told me with scared voice,
you will make it to the U.S.

360
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:12,086
...but not holding god's hand,
but holding the devil's spawn.

361
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:22,428
if you come with us, you can show me
the letter board you are talking about...

362
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:25,640
...we are heading to New Jersey.

363
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,394
They are coming for you right?

364
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:35,898
I think so, sooner or later they will find me...

365
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:39,902
...the gang has good memory.

366
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:42,862
Are you afraid?

367
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,949
To be killed?

368
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:51,495
No, I live by the day.

369
00:57:52,371 --> 00:57:56,874
What worries me is not knowing
what time and which day they will kill me.

370
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,713
- So you have not seen him?
- No.

371
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,426
He has a teardrop tatooed here.

372
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:13,097
No, I haven't seen anyone tatooed,
since 5 days ago until now you guys.

373
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:23,690
Hey, sons of a bitch!!

374
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:27,985
I know about that guy you are looking for...

375
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:33,281
...he has a tear drop tatooed here.

376
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,880
Thank you!!

377
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:51,097
We have to get down...

378
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:52,599
What?

379
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,601
We have to get down.

380
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,561
why?

381
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:01,398
In this station, immigration is
always fucking up...

382
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:03,233
...and sometimes the police also.

383
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,945
So what do we do?

384
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:12,157
We get down and surround the train fast,
we must be alert!

385
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:37,428
Good day for running, uh?

386
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:42,517
Me and Smiley will go the other way...

387
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,893
...we see each other in the other side of the station.

388
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:35,478
Hey, what's up, ese?

389
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:37,981
The "M", what's your neighborhood, fucker?

390
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:41,859
Hey, look at the guy, he is from the other gang.

391
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:50,241
Take out your fucking gun Smiley!

392
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,414
Don't worry Homie, these
guys always miss the target...

393
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,501
...except this one.

394
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:04,138
Where the fuck were you Homies?

395
01:03:04,638 --> 01:03:07,015
...didn't you hear the gunshots?

396
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,562
Yes Homie, but we almost catch Casper.

397
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:19,901
You left us behind with those
assholes, and.. where is Casper?

398
01:03:21,403 --> 01:03:22,779
In the train.

399
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,949
I want to take that fucker down.

400
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:30,743
Get on, Smiley, you go in the front.

401
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,104
You are leaving just like that?

402
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:29,981
So what do you want?

403
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,107
Go with you.

404
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:49,498
Oh, God! She fucked up!!

405
01:06:56,504 --> 01:06:58,422
I can't take care of you.

406
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,677
I am not asking you for it.

407
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,014
For god sake Sayra,
realize  that I am a dead man!

408
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,600
...don't you get it?

409
01:07:13,434 --> 01:07:14,936
Don't worry Willie.

410
01:07:15,853 --> 01:07:17,563
Everything will be ok.

411
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:32,493
You messed up, you don't have
any idea about the mess you are in.

412
01:07:47,881 --> 01:07:51,134
Horacio, Sayra is not here.

413
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:05,354
Oh Casper, why the fuck you came here?

414
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:09,024
You are just putting me into trouble.

415
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:15,488
I can do what you are asking for,
but really, it's trouble.

416
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:18,907
I have to do some things first.

417
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:21,410
you guys hungry?

418
01:08:22,453 --> 01:08:25,371
You can stay sleeping in the sofa.

419
01:08:26,372 --> 01:08:28,166
Do you guys want to take a shower?

420
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:34,045
You are a little one.

421
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:38,674
Well, let me see what I've got.

422
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:44,679
I thought you didn't have family.

423
01:08:44,804 --> 01:08:47,682
I don't, she is not my aunt...

424
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,059
...I used to take people on her territory.

425
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:53,353
And she will take us to the border?

426
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:58,107
Are you coming with me?

427
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:00,610
Let's see, try this on..

428
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:03,404
I hope it fits you.

429
01:09:03,821 --> 01:09:05,363
The shower is over there...

430
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:07,657
...but don't get close to the window, ok?

431
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:09,951
I don't want anyone to know you are here.

432
01:09:28,258 --> 01:09:31,053
What are you going to do with the girl?

433
01:09:32,804 --> 01:09:37,183
I'll help her get to the border
so she can find her family over there.

434
01:09:39,393 --> 01:09:41,812
And what do you get with all this?

435
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:43,313
Nothing.

436
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:47,900
Ok, Casper.

437
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:52,321
Going straight to the border...

438
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,074
...you know what awaits for you.

439
01:09:57,575 --> 01:09:59,786
Did you know they already called me?

440
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,371
And what did you tell them?

441
01:10:02,538 --> 01:10:07,167
Nothing, the truth, that I haven't seen you...
but they called me yesterday.

442
01:10:13,631 --> 01:10:16,341
You are not going to tell them, right?

443
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,677
I always do the right thing.

444
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:22,471
Maybe she went down to
take a pee and the train left her.

445
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,519
She left.

446
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:32,730
So, we wait here.

447
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,904
We can't wait.

448
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,408
We have to go
or we won't get there either.

449
01:11:12,556 --> 01:11:14,808
Ok, fuck!

450
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:29,654
Take this.

451
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:30,739
Thank you, aunt.

452
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,198
Don't thank me.

453
01:12:00,263 --> 01:12:04,768
"Sol", it's a pleasure to hear you.

454
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,415
Are you afraid?

455
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:36,086
No, if I am with you I am ok.

456
01:12:40,298 --> 01:12:45,636
The opposite, while you
are with me you are not ok.

457
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,723
I don't care, I trust you.

458
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:54,893
This scar here...

459
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:01,983
...my gang sent me to leave
a "chicken" to the border...

460
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:10,949
...and in Tamaulipas, a cop started to shoot me...

461
01:13:12,784 --> 01:13:19,707
...and here, one from the 18,
there was a fight in their territory.

462
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:27,047
This scar here is from the night that the
Homies that I have defended all my life...

463
01:13:29,882 --> 01:13:32,426
...killed my love.

464
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:39,932
And I couldn't do anything for her.

465
01:13:44,227 --> 01:13:47,439
Do you still trust me, Sayra?

466
01:13:49,775 --> 01:13:52,193
We both know what a loss is.

467
01:13:53,486 --> 01:13:58,740
All that I know, is that my
whole life has been worthless.

468
01:13:59,657 --> 01:14:02,619
And that I can ruin your life too.

469
01:14:18,048 --> 01:14:26,555
Get off, go away!!

470
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,156
I love you!

471
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:50,368
Come on, say it with more feeling.

472
01:14:51,077 --> 01:14:54,246
It's just that I love you so much
that I don't even know what to tell you.

473
01:14:54,496 --> 01:14:56,456
I don't know how to express it.

474
01:15:01,544 --> 01:15:05,089
if you can measure it with
your hands, how much would it be?

475
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:09,884
It wouldn't be possible, I would need many miles...

476
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:14,179
...or the whole universe to
tell you how much I love you.

477
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,700
Get off, you assholes!!

478
01:17:17,911 --> 01:17:21,706
Hide, hide, hide there.

479
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:57,079
Ok, this card is your pass,
it's only valid for 3 nights...

480
01:18:57,621 --> 01:19:01,750
...then you have to leave to give
space to the people that just arrived.

481
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:08,381
You have two meals everyday, lunch and
dinner and please respect the rules in the wall.

482
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:49,582
We don't want low life people like
you here, you fucking gangster.

483
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,459
Not now.

484
01:19:51,793 --> 01:19:55,587
That's the least, you can't be here!

485
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,554
Let him go kid, let him!

486
01:20:14,353 --> 01:20:19,275
Hey, I can't believe that you are here.

487
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:21,776
Have you seen my dad and my uncle?

488
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,492
What?

489
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,745
Your uncle was deported, and......

490
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,418
...your father is not with us anymore.

491
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,694
When we are in the other side,
I want you to promise something.

492
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:50,321
What?

493
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:54,157
That no matter what, you
will look for your family in New Jersey.

494
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:04,082
Now you have to little sisters
that have no father anymore.

495
01:23:05,042 --> 01:23:09,003
I would be trouble for them,
as I am for everyone.

496
01:23:09,587 --> 01:23:10,963
Not for me.

497
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:19,512
But you have to help them
in something, working.

498
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,644
Are you coming with me?

499
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:29,062
Yes.

500
01:23:48,912 --> 01:23:50,413
I am looking for a boat.

501
01:23:50,914 --> 01:23:52,624
Do you want to cross?

502
01:24:09,763 --> 01:24:10,806
come on!

503
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:20,272
I can only pass one at the time.

504
01:24:20,648 --> 01:24:21,691
The money?

505
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:24,484
When we cross we give it to you.

506
01:24:51,674 --> 01:24:52,842
Go on fast.

507
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:09,773
Turn around.

508
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:37,380
Hurry up and get in the water.

509
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:07,865
No... we have to go back!!!!

510
01:26:23,169 --> 01:26:24,712
Let me go!

511
01:26:42,144 --> 01:26:43,436
Smiley....

512
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:49,567
The gang is forever, Homie.

513
01:29:02,305 --> 01:29:04,975
~ My lips became sealed at this moment...~

514
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:11,105
~ ...when I tried to say goodbye. ~

515
01:29:11,355 --> 01:29:13,857
~ and how would my soul be if... ~

516
01:29:14,483 --> 01:29:17,944
~ ...I will live far away from you. ~

517
01:29:20,572 --> 01:29:24,116
~ Come to my side, ~

518
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:28,412
~ ...come life of my own being. ~

519
01:29:28,745 --> 01:29:31,956
~ I want to see me in your eyes... ~

520
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:37,377
~ ...and get drunk in the breath
that your mouth exhales... ~

521
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:39,462
~ ...with the sweetness... ~

522
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:44,300
~...natural from your loving soul. ~

523
01:29:44,508 --> 01:29:50,930
~ That destiny forces me
with pain to let you go.~

524
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:27,420
~ Abscent from you I will live woman... ~

525
01:30:27,545 --> 01:30:34,009
~ ...but you live in my sad heart. ~

526
01:30:35,385 --> 01:30:37,471
~ Yours is my heart. ~

527
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:42,350
~ You are the angel that came from the sky... ~

528
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:49,231
~ ...to this tough life,
to sweeten my bitter youth. ~

529
01:30:52,275 --> 01:30:57,321
~ But if there is a disgrace... ~

530
01:30:57,988 --> 01:31:01,282
~ ...that you die, or I die... ~

531
