1
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,528
I did everything that I was supposed to do.

2
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:40,102
I didn't cry in meetings.
I didn't wear short skirts.

3
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:43,246
I put up with the weird upper management guys

4
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:45,808
that kiss you on the mouth at Christmas.

5
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,721
Is it fair that to be the youngest VP
in my company,

6
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,025
I will be the oldest mom at preschool?

7
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:54,768
Not really,but that's part of the deal.

8
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,810
I made a choice.

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,783
Some women got pregnant. I got promotions.

10
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,877
And I still aspire to meet someone

11
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,190
and fall in love and get married,

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,174
but that is a very high-risk scenario.

13
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,677
And I want a baby now. I'm 37.

14
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:21,356
It's too much for a first date,isn't it?
I said too much.

15
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,899
I'm just gonna go use the...

16
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,054
I'm gonna need this to go.

17
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,308
Good morning. Thank you for
being here so early.

18
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:21,609
Hi. How are you?

19
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,281
Let's get started.

20
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,221
That one.

21
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,087
Well...

22
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,531
I just don't like your uterus.

23
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,592
Don't get me wrong.

24
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:12,166
Your eggs are in great shape,
but you have a T-shaped uterus.

25
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,519
That combined with your advanced maternal age,

26
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,351
it's preventing proper implantation.

27
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,294
Why do I have this T-shaped uterus?

28
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,266
Well,probably has something to
do with medication

29
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:25,029
that was given to your mother
when she was pregnant with you.

30
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:26,541
We used lot of drugs back in the '70s

31
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:29,674
which we now know can cause infertility.

32
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:31,016
Infertility?

33
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:35,320
Yeah. I would say that your chances
of conceiving are very low.

34
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,421
How low?

35
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,523
Well,I don't want to assign a number to it.

36
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:42,598
What would you assign it? A color,
a nickname,a locker?

37
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,899
Okay.

38
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,001
One in a million.

39
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,816
I just don't like...

40
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,688
Don't say that again.

41
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:56,873
Come to think of it,

42
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:00,066
I did take something for liver
spots when I was pregnant with you,

43
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:04,170
but I really don't see how that
could cause any problems for your uterus.

44
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:08,155
It was just a different time.
They didn't warn people about side effects.

45
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,666
They warned me.

46
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,929
I think I might even have signed something.

47
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:13,030
What?

48
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,945
Kate,I was 30 years old. I was
starting to get liver spots. Liver spots!

49
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,948
I just hope you put this baby mania to rest.

50
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,350
It's not mania.

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,911
How many times have you tried now?

52
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,024
- Three?  - Nine.

53
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:27,625
The last two were in vitro.

54
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:29,067
Have you considered adoption?

55
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,129
I have applied for an adoption,yes.

56
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,643
Kate,please don't get a black baby.

57
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,315
Well,I don't think we'll have to
worry about that,

58
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:39,287
because for a single woman,

59
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,089
it can take about five years
to get an adoption.

60
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,823
I've just had it with all these
movie stars showing off.

61
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,336
"Look at me and my black baby."

62
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:49,879
Kill me. I want you to stab me with something.

63
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,922
You know,Kate,not everyone is as tolerant

64
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:55,655
of your alternative lifestyle as we are.

65
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,918
Being single is not an alternative lifestyle.

66
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,900
It is when you're 37.

67
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:05,005
Oh,out like a light.

68
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,606
Have you thought about using a surrogate?

69
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,278
I saw a thing about it on Dateline.

70
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:10,220
No,it's weird. It's for weirdoes.

71
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,782
I'm just gonna keep trying by myself.

72
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,315
Kate,building a family is not
like opening one of your stores.

73
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:19,129
It's not an executive decision.
It's real life. It's messy.

74
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,373
These hormone injections make
me want to punch you in the face right now.

75
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,574
No hitting.

76
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:24,946
- That's right.  - You're right.

77
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,958
- There you go.  - Come on.

78
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,751
Well,how much longer are you
gonna put your body through this?

79
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,593
Look,I know for years I said I
didn't want one,

80
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:33,465
but I just woke up one day,

81
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:37,269
and I felt like every baby on
the street was staring at me.

82
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,752
Katie's coming out of the mommy closet.

83
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:43,846
Hey,Tyler.

84
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:46,588
Tyler,what is this all over you?

85
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:48,691
Is that chocolate or poop?

86
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:51,794
Is that chocolate or poop?

87
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,207
It's chocolate.

88
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,281
What if that had been poop?

89
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,583
I told you,messy,but great.

90
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,510
Not bad.

91
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,462
Everybody do a shot of this pea soup.

92
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:24,638
Let's go with this. Call it "Health Monster."

93
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,572
That's great.

94
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,203
It's what I do.

95
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:32,216
You know,

96
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,791
I was swimming this morning with
the dolphins in Costa Rica,

97
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,863
and I realized something.

98
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:43,208
I am a great man.

99
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,651
And great men do great things.

100
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,885
I want to open a flagship store
right here in Philadelphia.

101
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,228
I want it to be the biggest
store we ever built,

102
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:55,501
I want it to be made of 100%
recyclable materials,

103
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:59,976
and I want it to be so beautiful
that people want to get married in it.

104
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,652
Kate,join me up here.

105
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:10,467
I'm wearing a dress,Barry.

106
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,299
Won't you?

107
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,470
Sure.

108
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:19,917
Okay.

109
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:29,867
Kate,I want you to spearhead this
as our new vice president.

110
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,053
This is me transferring my success to you.

111
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,921
Thank you,Barry.

112
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:44,803
Hold on.

113
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,382
Thanks.

114
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,356
- Congratulations.  - Yeah.

115
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,359
- Thank you.  - Congratulations,Kate.

116
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:45,157
Hello. I'm Chaffee Bicknell.

117
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,430
There's just one of you.

118
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,064
I thought Chaffee and Bicknell
were two different people.

119
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,020
- Come in.  - Certainly.

120
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,858
I started this business because
I saw a growth market.

121
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,931
We don't do our own taxes anymore.

122
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:09,742
We don't program our computers.

123
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,144
We outsource.

124
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,187
And what is surrogacy if not outsourcing?

125
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,229
Wait. You're not saying my baby
would be carried

126
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:19,663
by some poor,underpaid woman
in the third world.

127
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,794
No.

128
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,843
We're also expensive.

129
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:31,185
Our fee is $100,000.

130
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:35,790
It costs more to have someone
born than to have someone killed.

131
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,462
It takes longer.

132
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:41,506
All of our surrogates undergo
extensive background checks.

133
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,349
Criminal records,credit reports,
medical histories

134
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,281
and psychological testing.

135
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,414
But why do these women do it?
Is it just for the money?

136
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:54,440
You do your job for the money,
but I bet you love it and you're good at it.

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,972
Let me ask you a question.

138
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:58,804
Do you plan on hiring a nanny?

139
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,147
Of course. I have to go back to work.

140
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,848
How is this any different?

141
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:07,263
A nanny is someone you trust to
take care of your baby after it's born.

142
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,469
A surrogate mother is someone you trust to
take care of your baby before it's born.

143
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,871
Either way it's your baby.

144
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,114
And here's my baby.

145
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:22,529
Hello,my sweetheart. Hello,little one.

146
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,764
Oh,yes. What a good girl. Yes.

147
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,767
Everyone deserves this.

148
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:33,180
That's why I wanna remove the
stigma from surrogacy.

149
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,314
There's no wrong way to make a family.

150
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:38,156
And you're proof of that.

151
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:39,817
How do you mean?

152
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,841
Just that you have this beautiful
baby using surrogacy.

153
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:43,932
Oh,no.

154
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,636
My husband and I conceived Sabrina
the old-fashioned way.

155
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,337
But you're so... - Old?

156
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:53,221
You wouldn't think so if you saw my uterus.

157
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,735
But you know what really made
this little angel possible?

158
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,427
A time machine?

159
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,199
A positive attitude.

160
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,241
You may not have my fertile body,

161
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:05,304
but with my help you can still be a mother.

162
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,618
Make the cracks break Shake it till they drop

163
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,890
Make the booty go wah,wah,wah

164
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,363
Make the cracks break Shake it till they drop

165
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:14,934
Make the booty go wah,wah,wah

166
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,066
Nice.

167
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,507
Yo,who you waiting on again?

168
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:21,742
Her name's Angie. Well,she might
be my surrogate mother.

169
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,914
That's right. You got your baby mama coming.

170
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,586
You know I got two baby mamas,right?

171
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,148
No,this is different.
You had relationships with those women.

172
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,660
No,I had no relationships with those women.

173
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,762
I had relations with those women.

174
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:35,176
No. I'm paying her. This was set
up by an agency.

175
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:38,619
There are contracts involved.
It's strictly business.

176
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,653
You pay the bills,she have the baby.
That's called a baby mama.

177
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:44,385
You ask any black man in Philadelphia.

178
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,641
Yo,what if that's your baby mama?

179
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,732
I don't think that's her.

180
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,115
Here come your baby mama

181
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,247
Riding a Suzuki

182
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,892
I wanna spend about 15 minutes here,

183
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:03,335
then I wanna get my picture taken
punching the Rocky statue.

184
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,737
Yeah,well,you're gonna have to sketch it,

185
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:05,998
'cause I didn't bring a camera.

186
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,101
Okay,you did that on purpose,didn't you?
Trying to sabotage my art.

187
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:10,413
- This might be them.
- All right,I'm an artist.

188
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,974
- Oscar,this might be them.
- I want it to look artistic.

189
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,576
You told me to tell you when
you were sounding ignorant.

190
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:14,677
You're sounding ignorant.

191
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,559
- Angie?  - What?

192
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,761
I'm Kate.

193
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,202
Hi.

194
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,876
Nice to meet you. This is Carl,my husband.

195
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,067
Common-law.

196
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:26,139
He always says that.

197
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,212
Well,please,come on in.

198
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:32,296
Thank you.

199
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:36,240
Listen,shut her down in drive and
slam it into park

200
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,561
or it'll start smoking,okay?

201
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,804
And I'll be back with this.

202
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:49,164
So,how long have you two been together?

203
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:51,496
We met the summer after I discontinued
high school.

204
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,698
And we've been together ever since.

205
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,370
He never officially asked me to be his wife,

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,032
but he never asked me to not be
his wife either,

207
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,374
so things are going pretty good.

208
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:05,591
Wow. The place is amazing.

209
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,792
Let me...

210
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:07,923
Beautiful.

211
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:12,939
Kind of looks like Kate Hudson's
New York apartment.

212
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,073
She read that somewhere.
I don't think she's saying it right.

213
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,215
No,she's saying it right.

214
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:22,058
Out of all the places that we've
interviewed at,

215
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,930
this is by far the nicest.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,991
What does your husband do?

217
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,374
Well,I don't have a husband.

218
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:30,637
Got this place all by yourself?
Must have a really fancy job.

219
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:35,022
Well,I am the vice president of
development for Round Earth Foods.

220
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,785
So you take over if the president is shot?

221
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:38,856
Well...

222
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,030
- I like your shirt.
- Thanks.

223
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,634
It's a shirt-vest kind of... I don't know.

224
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:49,808
I just like making styles and stuff.
It's something I like to do.

225
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,021
What,you don't get down with rap?

226
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,656
Boy,somewhere in there I
have an old Salt-n-Pepa CD.

227
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:58,897
Hmm...

228
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,211
What do you do,Carl?

229
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,974
Carl is an inventor slash entrepreneur.

230
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,075
Yeah.

231
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,417
I'm still looking for that home run,you know.

232
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:13,332
I mean,when I saw the iPod the first time,
I was like...

233
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:14,964
I mean,I could've kicked myself.

234
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,636
That was so hard on him.

235
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,768
Now we're pretty tight on cash.

236
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,840
So that led you to surrogacy?

237
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,182
Hey,I gotta say,

238
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:25,555
when I first thought about Angie
carrying someone else's baby,

239
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,617
I felt weird about it.

240
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,189
Then I thought,"Oh,my God,

241
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,262
"if my wife's gotta have sex
with someone else's husband to do this..."

242
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,974
- Out of the question.
- "...that's gonna cost extra."

243
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:35,536
It's out of the question.

244
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:38,509
Wow. This is a nice view.

245
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,591
So,have you done this before?

246
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,794
No. But I know I'm good at getting pregnant.

247
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,496
That's not what I'm asking about.

248
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:46,938
You know,we all had our scares.

249
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,130
- No,not really.  - Me neither.

250
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:55,046
Pardon my asking this,but how many
couples,women,

251
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:58,720
how many people are you interviewing
before you make your decision?

252
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,866
I guess you're like our sixth or seventh.

253
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:05,667
And how's it going?

254
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,579
Good.

255
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,381
You know how in science they say that

256
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:13,085
everybody's aura gives off a different color?

257
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,027
I can read those auras.

258
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm very sensitive to people's energies.

259
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,472
So,I meet new people and I get exhausted.

260
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,803
Oh,yeah.

261
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,777
What color is my aura?

262
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,008
Let me see.

263
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,753
Sunsetty. It's like a sunset.

264
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,625
- I'm really digging it.  - Good.

265
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,287
- Congratulations.  - Good,good.

266
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:34,388
Really good color.

267
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:35,629
Well,good.

268
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,332
Because I really hope that you like me,Angie,

269
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:42,787
because I'm asking you for a very
big favor,you know.

270
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,691
You have a God-given ability that
I just don't have.

271
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,232
I know I could be good at this.

272
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,494
I think you could,too.

273
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,296
And,you know,it's nice to feel...

274
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:52,927
- Needed?  - Yeah. Needed.

275
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:54,309
Important,useful?

276
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,570
I like all those words.

277
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,413
Yeah,well,I can't do this without you.
I've tried.

278
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,185
I need you,Angie.

279
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,832
I'm gonna make a decision.

280
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,894
I made my decision.

281
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,536
Decision made.

282
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:14,380
Kate,I want you to put your baby inside me.

283
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,823
Angie,I'm gonna put my baby inside you.

284
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:10,028
This stuff is good. What's the
street name for this?

285
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,731
So as you can see,

286
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:35,876
we've transferred three of Kate's
fertilized eggs to your womb,Angie.

287
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,788
Now with the hormones you've been taking,

288
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:41,351
the probability of success is about 60%.

289
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:44,625
You should continue taking the
hormones and get as much rest as possible.

290
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:48,369
And in about two weeks,you can
take a home pregnancy test.

291
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,484
I live right here.

292
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,212
Thanks for driving me all the way home.

293
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,755
Carl couldn't leave the house 'cause
he's trying to win a radio contest.

294
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,627
Well,I would've offered to do it anyway.

295
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:16,759
Here,let me give you some money for gas.

296
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,701
No,no,please. It's my treat.

297
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:19,802
Really?

298
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,504
Of course. Angie,you don't understand.

299
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,806
I want to be there for you every
step of the way.

300
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,452
I hope you don't mind. I bought
you some groceries.

301
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:32,365
I thought you might want to start
eating organic.

302
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,268
That crap is for rich people
who hate themselves.

303
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,210
Sorry,this place is such a mess.

304
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,142
I haven't had time to clean up.

305
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,676
No,it has a nice old-timey smell.

306
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:45,920
Is that an alligator?

307
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,933
Hellboy? No,that's Carl's iguana.

308
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:52,907
Great. Well,I'm gonna put this
fruit in your refrigerator.

309
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,912
That's the song!

310
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:03,258
When they play Red Red Wine,
you gotta be the 103.7th caller.

311
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,160
- What up,baby lady?
- Hello.

312
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,531
Shut the door,Carl!

313
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,073
How am I gonna talk through a door?

314
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,435
How can you be the 103.7th caller?

315
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:13,378
Angie,I don't have time to explain
arithmetic to you.

316
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,510
That don't make no sense.

317
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,352
I will see you in two weeks.
Please try to get some...

318
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,364
Would you grab my smokes?

319
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:21,157
You know you're not supposed
to smoke in front of me. I'm trying to quit.

320
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:23,499
- ...rest. Try to get some rest.
- Yeah,that's your situation,all right?

321
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,743
I'm in here trying to win us Arena
Football tickets.

322
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,214
Close the door,Carl.

323
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:30,116
So,what we're looking for

324
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:34,180
is at least 15,000 square feet
in the next cool neighborhood.

325
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,822
It can be open lots.

326
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,094
It can be buildings that we buy
and tear down,

327
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,436
although no historic buildings.

328
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,979
We want to be perceived as
enhancing the neighborhood,

329
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,811
not destroying its character.

330
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:49,827
Also,Barry would like to use mostly
found and recycled materials.

331
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,949
So that's gonna affect us,zoning-wise.

332
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,902
I don't care what we spend,
but we have to get it right.

333
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:17,116
Shannon! Dante! Anybody?

334
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,585
Sorry about that. Welcome to Super Fruity.
What can I get you?

335
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:28,698
Does the Orange You Glad I Didn't Say Banana?

336
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:31,331
in fact contain banana?

337
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:33,383
Yeah. Yeah,but it's a good question.

338
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:36,686
I think the name's a little more
clever than it is informative.

339
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,448
Well,I will try it.

340
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:39,549
Okay.

341
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,023
Hey,I'm looking for a new apartment.

342
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,795
What is your read on this neighborhood?

343
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,209
The neighborhood's good. It's good.
It's changing a lot.

344
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,412
A lot of condos going up.

345
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:53,754
The real estate people are trying
to give it one of those

346
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,258
clever names,they call it WeBeSoCa,

347
00:21:57,328 --> 00:22:01,232
which is Webster,south of Catherine,I guess.

348
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,835
How's business?

349
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,079
It's a little slow.

350
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,954
But kind of tough,you know,
going up against the man.

351
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:14,086
The cops?

352
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,187
Jamba Juice.

353
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,498
Jamba Juice is the man?

354
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,599
Yeah.

355
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,831
Corporate juice pimps.

356
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,103
Thought you should know,and you'll
feel free to tell your friends.

357
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:23,115
Okay. I will tell them.

358
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,661
Okay,now. You have a super fruity day.

359
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:34,727
I want you to start finding out

360
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:39,873
what's available between the 1500 block
and 1800 block of West Catherine Street.

361
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:43,617
Ron,I gotta call you back.

362
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,218
- Angie?  - Hi,it's Angie.

363
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,531
I know. I know. So,any news?

364
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,474
Well,I peed on one of those stick thingies,
and it said yes.

365
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:53,607
Angie,that is just the greatest news!

366
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,209
That's just unbelievably great.

367
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,270
Yeah,yeah.

368
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,182
Thank you so much,Angie.

369
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,716
If you need anything,anything at all,
you let me know,okay?

370
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:03,027
Yeah,okay. I will.

371
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,361
I'm having a baby!

372
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,152
Hello.

373
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:38,224
What if the baby's a hermaphrodite?

374
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:39,295
What?

375
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,967
A chick with a dick.

376
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,380
I heard it happens to about 2% of babies.

377
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,751
Well,that's crazy.

378
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,284
That would mean that 10 people
from our high school were hermaphrodites.

379
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:48,445
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

380
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,047
No,that sounds about right,actually.

381
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,830
You can't solve problems by
worrying about them.

382
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,232
Is that Alex? What does she want
for her birthday?

383
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:58,716
Karaoke Revolution or a cell phone.

384
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:00,117
She's four.

385
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,252
Do you think it's too much if I
ask Angie to call me every day?

386
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,194
She just seems so chaotic.

387
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:07,425
I don't know if she's eating right.

388
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,756
Is she getting enough exercise?

389
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,458
Is she moving around too much?

390
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:11,770
You're only six weeks in.

391
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,573
You can't put her in a cage and
force-feed her.

392
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:15,804
I know. I know.

393
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,175
Expecting a baby?

394
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,718
Did I tell you? I found a location
for the new store.

395
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:20,879
Yeah,I have to pitch it tomorrow.

396
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,523
It's gonna be a girl.
That's what's making your hair so dry.

397
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,035
Cash or credit?

398
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:27,126
Cash.

399
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:47,908
Oscar?

400
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:52,953
You got baby mama drama.

401
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:55,626
Hey,I left Carl.

402
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:59,140
I found out he was effing around on me,
so we got into a huge fight.

403
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,871
Things got really physical.

404
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,033
Oh,my God. Are you okay?

405
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:03,844
Yeah. I didn't hit him too hard.

406
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:06,317
Hey,I brought you a picture of the baby.

407
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:08,750
You know,an ultrasound picture.

408
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,291
Oh,my gosh.

409
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:14,656
Looks like a squirrel.

410
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,929
A cute,cute squirrel.

411
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:20,312
Anyway,it's kind of early,
so you can't really see anything,

412
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:23,215
but they took a picture of it just
to make sure it's growing right.

413
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:24,546
They said all the parts are good.

414
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,749
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've been there.

415
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,261
I didn't want to bother you.

416
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:41,454
Don't worry. This couch is more
comfortable than it looks.

417
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:45,829
I also put a stack of clean towels
for you in the bathroom.

418
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:48,171
Do you need a toothbrush?

419
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:51,365
Because I have some extras that
I keep for houseguests.

420
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,494
Good night,squirrel.

421
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,015
What we have here is our Boo Boo Buster
No-Slam Door,okay?

422
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,076
Watch how this works.

423
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:15,290
You can just slam it. It bounces right back.

424
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,492
So you can put your fingers right
on in there,and it wouldn't...

425
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:19,624
Not you,it'll only work for baby fingers.

426
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,966
- Okay.  - Okay?

427
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:24,750
Also included in your premium package,

428
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,282
we have child protection everywhere.

429
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,757
The doors,the door handles,
you have the cabinets,

430
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,891
caps all over the outlets,cabinets,everything.

431
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:38,564
It's just baby-proof all over the place.

432
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:42,078
Shouldn't be a problem for anybody
over the age of seven.

433
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:48,985
You sure have done a great job

434
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,857
getting an early jump on your baby-proofing.

435
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:52,129
Well,you guys are the best in the city,

436
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,690
and I didn't want to risk being
on a waiting list.

437
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,805
True. But you can't be no more
than three,four months pregnant.

438
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:11,139
There's something wrong with your toilet.

439
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,471
I'm sorry I broke one of your rules.

440
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:16,074
You peed in the sink. Isn't that
against everyone's rules?

441
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,516
Only a crazy person locks their toilet.

442
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:20,719
It's for the baby. It's safe.

443
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,130
Please don't touch anything else.

444
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:35,995
I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry.

445
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,617
45 minutes late. This isn't like you.

446
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,429
I'm sorry,Barry. I'm just a
little out of whack today.

447
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,972
Want me to get Dr. Gary down here?
Give you a shot of bee pollen?

448
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:45,104
No,thank you. I'm good. Let's do this.

449
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,006
Thank you for waiting,everyone.

450
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:49,990
This may look like a dilapidated warehouse...

451
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,353
# Lady Luck gets on my side #

452
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:56,026
# We're gonna rock this town alive #

453
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:57,858
# I'll let her rough me up #

454
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:58,959
Thanks,Oscar.

455
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,030
# She knocks me out #

456
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,604
# She walks like she talks and
she talks like she walks #

457
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,915
# She bangs,she bangs #

458
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,118
- Hey.  - What are you doing?

459
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,279
What is this mess?

460
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,420
# Oh,baby,she moves,she moves #

461
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,692
This game is awesome. Where did you get this?

462
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,825
That's supposed to be my niece's
birthday present.

463
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:14,926
Sorry.

464
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,568
Angie,what kind of food is this
for a pregnant woman?

465
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:20,271
Dr. Pepper,Pringles,Tastykakes?

466
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:23,375
Red Bull?

467
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,927
Angie,Red Bull?

468
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:29,431
You have to remember that you
are carrying something very precious.

469
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,033
- Like a little puppy.  - Yeah.

470
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,304
Yeah. Or a baby.

471
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:37,009
What you eat,the baby eats.
What you listen to,the baby listens to.

472
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,141
If you listen to DMX,the baby
comes out going...

473
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:43,996
Are those cigarettes?

474
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,228
What? No. Where?

475
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,931
Do you know how stupid it is to smoke at all

476
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:49,442
let alone when you are pregnant?

477
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:51,104
I'm not smoking. I swear,I'm not...

478
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:57,250
Why would you answer my phone?

479
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,922
- Hello.  - Kate,we're moving forward.

480
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:01,525
I think that that is a great decision,Barry.

481
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:05,799
Yes,let's get those facts and
figures,Barry,into the idea machine.

482
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,941
We should close in a couple of weeks.

483
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,983
I want you to put together a press conference.

484
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,816
How about we start with a little
community outreach

485
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,658
and get the people in the neighborhood
on our side,

486
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,630
and then let the press find us?

487
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,963
That's why I'm a genius for hiring
people like you.

488
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,368
All right,you.

489
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:25,780
My job gives me access to the most nutritious,

490
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,042
chemical-free food in the world.

491
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:30,425
I don't want my kid born addicted
to high-fructose corn syrup.

492
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:35,301
There is a thing called being too healthy.
That's what killed Bruce Lee.

493
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,434
Really? Where did you read that?
The Weekly World Dum-Dum?

494
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:43,149
All right. This is your folic
acid and this is your pre-natal vitamin.

495
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:44,520
You're serious about this?

496
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,323
I don't want my baby to have a pinhead.

497
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:49,225
I can't do it.

498
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:51,698
I got it. It's going...

499
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:53,540
I can't swallow it.

500
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,605
What is this?

501
00:29:58,685 --> 00:29:59,706
Water.

502
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:01,548
It's horrible!

503
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,063
- I need a...
- No,I can't put it in your butt.

504
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,435
Angie,cats can do this. Come on.

505
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,307
- It's in there.
- Just try.

506
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,679
Just relax.

507
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:14,442
Close your eyes,open your mouth,

508
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,885
and do it! Swallow it.

509
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:20,088
Take it. There you go! You did it.

510
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,602
Hey,I'm just like a lot of you.

511
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:29,408
I grew up at 52nd and Walnut.
I attended West Philly High.

512
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:33,151
I smoked a joint with Hall & Oates
during the bicentennial,all of that.

513
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,053
But unlike a lot of you,

514
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,726
I have since traveled the world.

515
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,330
I've had papaya on the beach at
Virgin Gorda.

516
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,404
I've toasted pine nuts at the
mouth of an active volcano.

517
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:49,549
I sat down with Native Americans
and had some amazing salmon.

518
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,283
And I'm here to share my experiences with you.

519
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:55,895
You know,I was talking to Jimmy
Buffett this morning about trans fats...

520
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,837
Barry,the time.

521
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,570
Well,I'm sorry I can't stay longer,

522
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,843
but I have to swing by my son's graduation.

523
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,144
So I will turn you over

524
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:07,818
to our vice president of development,
Ms. Kate Holbrook.

525
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,124
Good morning and thank you...

526
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,435
Will there be pedestrian access
during construction?

527
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,337
How can you charge $4 for one mango?

528
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,809
What's your carbon footprint?

529
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,782
Okay,how about we line up down
front here at the microphone?

530
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:22,584
And I can take your questions...

531
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:25,597
And I can take your questions one at a time.

532
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:27,859
Hi.

533
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,834
Rob Ackerman,WeBeSoCa Small
Business Owners' Association,

534
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:36,348
and I also own Super Fruity Smoothies.

535
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:38,120
It's like Jamba Juice.

536
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,253
No,it's not. It's not like Jamba Juice at all.

537
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,096
I think you've been to my store.

538
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,928
Yes,I have. I remember.

539
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:48,571
Did you ever find that apartment
you were looking for?

540
00:31:49,712 --> 00:31:51,204
Not yet. No.

541
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,877
Here's my question.
Exactly what portion of your profits

542
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:55,118
are gonna go towards rebuilding

543
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:57,991
and the revitalization of our community?

544
00:31:58,061 --> 00:31:59,292
Yes!

545
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:04,037
Thank you for that question.

546
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:11,585
Those are free,by the way.
You don't have to sneak them.

547
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,498
All of this stuff is our gift to you.

548
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:15,790
Hey,Kate.

549
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,491
Hi.

550
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:18,733
What a spread.

551
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:19,834
Thanks.

552
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,466
So,I had one last question for you.

553
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:22,777
Okay.

554
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,550
You never told me how you liked the smoothie.

555
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,553
Well,a little too much banana for me.

556
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:29,925
Wow.

557
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:31,887
You know,Mr. Ackerman...

558
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,028
No,no,no.

559
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:35,330
Mr. Ackerman's my dog. You gotta call me Rob.

560
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,073
Okay,Rob. I really don't want any tension

561
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:39,875
with the Small Business Owners' Association.

562
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,147
So I would be happy to sit down
with you some time and...

563
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:43,589
You asking me out on a date?

564
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,680
No.

565
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,163
You sure? 'Cause you lied to
me once already.

566
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,066
Yes,I'm sure.

567
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,968
See you around.

568
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:57,013
And then he asked me if I was
asking him out,and I was like,"What?"

569
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,244
Is he cute?

570
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,686
Yes,but you're missing the point.

571
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:03,830
Hold on,Caroline.

572
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,921
Angie?

573
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,134
I'm starving!

574
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,235
Well,look in the refrigerator,

575
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,508
there's a big container of Monster
Health Pea Soup.

576
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:14,642
This looks really weird and healthy.
I don't like it.

577
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:16,053
It's good for you.

578
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,184
I'm not trying to be dramatic,

579
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:19,887
but I would rather be shot in
the face than eat this stupid food.

580
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,870
Angie,just eat it,okay? Bye.

581
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,405
Caroline? She's crazy. It is like
living with a child.

582
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:29,477
Well,you know,you will literally be

583
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:31,039
living with a child soon.

584
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,821
Maybe you need to just get used to it.

585
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,262
Alex! Alex!

586
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:37,556
Wait. I'm an adult. She's an adult.
We will work this out.

587
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:43,772
You know,studies show that babies
can learn a second language in the womb.

588
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:46,515
You know,you should play an English tape,
so it can come out talking,

589
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:48,958
and it can be in commercials,
and you'll make a lot of money.

590
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,862
Next. The elephant has big ears.

591
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,768
Your CD's skipping. I'm gonna
watch TV instead.

592
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:05,555
- Oh,man. This show's awesome.
- In this next clip is a dad playing baseball

593
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,616
with his son.

594
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:08,659
That kid's gonna hit his dad in the nuts.

595
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:10,030
Beautiful day! What could possibly go wrong?

596
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,302
Hey,have you seen this one before?

597
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:15,175
You have a kid with a Wiffleball
bat and a dad with a crotch.

598
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:17,378
Proudest moment in any father-son relationship.

599
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:20,781
You know,it's not gonna be funny
if you ruin the ending!

600
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,254
Here comes the pitch!

601
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,199
It is! It's still funny!

602
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:32,173
Oh,man.

603
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:35,477
Did you just stick your gum under
my coffee table?

604
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,389
- I don't know.
- What do you mean,you don't know?

605
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:38,980
Do you think you're at an Arby's right now?

606
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,862
You know what? I wish I was at an Arby's.

607
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,906
'Cause there's better food and
cooler people there.

608
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,229
Did you stick all this gum under here?

609
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:49,041
I don't know!

610
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:50,943
Maybe you stuck some of it under there.

611
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,886
Yeah,actually you might be right,

612
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:55,828
because sometimes when I work a
really long day,

613
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,992
I like to come home and chew a
huge wad of Bubblicious gum

614
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,594
and stick it under my reclaimed
BarnWood coffee table!

615
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:03,236
Bitch,I don't know your life!

616
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:06,079
All right,ladies,there's no need to yell.

617
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:08,982
Well,the mystery remains as to
who put the gum under there.

618
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:10,113
No,it doesn't.

619
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:13,287
Kate,you're used to being the boss,

620
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:17,741
and,Angie,being pregnant makes
you feel vulnerable and sensitive.

621
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,604
I know my hormones are on a rollercoaster
right now.

622
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,306
Are you saying...

623
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,379
That's right. I'm expecting again.

624
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,293
Expecting what,a social security check?

625
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,195
- It's weird,isn't it?  - Yeah.

626
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,168
These conflicts are normal.

627
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:39,204
This is a highly unusual relationship,
and that's what this support group is for.

628
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:41,016
Jonathan would like to share again.

629
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:42,848
I mean,I'm only saying because
this reminded me

630
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:46,692
of something I was journaling,
just the other day.

631
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:49,865
I feel really bad because Karen
and I are fighting a lot,

632
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:54,040
because I think she's becoming morbidly obese.

633
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,173
And I keep reminding him that she is pregnant.

634
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:00,526
And then I realized that I am...

635
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,103
I'm... No. I am... Okay.

636
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:11,638
I'm anorexic,and it's really hard,
because she's so fat.

637
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,741
And I... I love Christopher so much,

638
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:18,025
and he's fat,and I'm afraid the baby's
gonna be fat.

639
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:21,428
And it's just me and two fatties.

640
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:24,912
I'm proud of you,Jonathan.
Thank you for sharing that.

641
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,414
Yeah,that's a...

642
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,945
Thank you.

643
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,189
Anyone else?

644
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,391
- I can go.  - Dave?

645
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:38,266
The wife and I are Methodists.
Ashley here is a Wiccan.

646
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:44,242
It's kind of like a witch.
They have stores,I think.

647
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:50,419
But,you know,at first,I was a
little worried about a witch carrying my child,

648
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,703
but I came around to the idea,
or she put a spell on me.

649
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,608
Did you do that,Ashley?

650
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,541
I'm sorry.

651
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,553
- I'd like to share something.
- Please.

652
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:05,595
Okay,I don't know,like,all the therapy terms...

653
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:08,128
Well,I don't know the therapy terms,
either. I don't go to therapy.

654
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:11,301
Yeah,but I'd just like to say that
Kate is always up in my business.

655
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:14,104
Well,when someone falls asleep
with a curling iron in their hair,

656
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:17,518
it becomes necessary to insert
yourself in their business.

657
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,349
That happened two times!

658
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,594
Angie,bottom line,you're carrying Kate's baby,

659
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:26,497
and you do wanna get paid,right?

660
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:27,768
Yeah.

661
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,812
That means that Kate does deserve some input.

662
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,616
But,Kate,you must remember that
a surrogate is not your employee,

663
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,777
but your partner.

664
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:39,451
Yeah,Kate,we're partners,
like Tom and Jerry.

665
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:40,962
Tom and Jerry hate each other.

666
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:43,125
What? They love each other!
What show are you watching?

667
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,266
They're a cat and a mouse.

668
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:45,637
They have so much fun together!

669
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:47,109
Children in Japan can understand that.

670
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:48,440
You are dead wrong.

671
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,954
I want you two to spend more time together.

672
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,027
- That's impossible. We're always together.
- I don't... Yeah.

673
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:57,229
Let Angie help you get ready for the baby.

674
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,702
Decorate the nursery together,pick out a crib.

675
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:02,865
Do all the things you would do
if you were pregnant,

676
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,677
just do them with Angie.

677
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:09,122
Wake up,partner. It's time for birthing class.

678
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:10,714
Yay.

679
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,086
Welcome to The Birthing Center.

680
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,297
In this birthing class,

681
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,140
we are going to help you new
mommies and daddies,

682
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,374
and our mommies and mommies,lesbian lovers...

683
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:21,475
- No.  - No.

684
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:24,678
...prepare for that marathon of labor.

685
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:26,190
Quick question before we start.

686
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,464
How many of you are planning on
doing natural childbirth?

687
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:33,978
That's a good show of hands.
That's so great,you're all so great.

688
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:39,684
And how many of you are planning
on using toxic Western medications

689
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:42,958
to drug your baby for your own
selfish comfort? Anyone?

690
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:54,340
Now this,this is the Lexus of strollers.

691
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,283
Got an iPod adapter,leather trim.
Check that out,feel that.

692
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,295
Back of your hand,back of your hand.

693
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:02,388
Now,what's the first word you
think of when you think of stroller?

694
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:03,769
Baby.

695
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,501
Okay,what's the second word you think of?

696
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:07,543
- Infant.  - No.

697
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:11,247
It's "top of the line safety features.
" Check this out.

698
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,481
I'll take it.

699
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,055
# I'm never gonna dance again #

700
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:21,568
# Guilty feet yihave got no rhythm #

701
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:24,131
# Though it's easy to pretend #

702
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:27,414
# I know you're not a fool #

703
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:28,886
What is the point of that game?

704
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:32,360
It gives you points depending on
how good you sing.

705
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,421
I'm the highest scorer.

706
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,993
You're the only one that's ever played it.

707
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,625
What is that smell?

708
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,077
I'm dying my roots.

709
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,079
I was just trying to get some highlights.

710
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:42,550
So many chemicals!

711
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,552
You're a brunette,you don't understand!

712
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:45,984
You're a brunette!

713
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:48,156
I was blond when I was a kid!

714
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:53,372
I'm clean. I'm clean!

715
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,182
Hi.

716
00:40:04,764 --> 00:40:07,737
I'm sorry,I think I may have
overreacted back there.

717
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:09,238
You think?

718
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:13,543
It's just this whole thing is very
important to me.

719
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:15,175
And frankly,it makes me a little bit crazy

720
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:17,217
that you get to feel it and experience it,

721
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:19,119
while I just watch.

722
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:26,827
And I might be a little bit jealous.

723
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:30,211
Jealous? How could you be jealous of me?

724
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:34,355
I'm sorry I called you stupid.

725
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,360
I'm sorry I farted into your purse.

726
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,802
What?

727
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:51,453
I found this shell while running
barefoot through the Toronto airport.

728
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:56,368
I want you to make our flagship store
like this shell.

729
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,705
You want it to look like the shell?

730
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:05,418
You know,Rick,when you talk to me
in that tone of voice,

731
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:07,320
I get incredibly angry.

732
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,411
I couldn't have been more specific...

733
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:10,253
You want it to have the essence of the shell.

734
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:15,328
Yes,that's it,exactly. Thank you,Kate.
I'm sorry I flipped,Rick.

735
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:17,881
Give me the essence of this shell.

736
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:23,286
As your pregnancy progresses,

737
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:26,119
your partner can help you prep
your perineum

738
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,792
for the great stretch of delivery.

739
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:34,608
Massage the area daily with a little EVOO

740
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:38,342
to help you stretch and prevent tearing.

741
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:39,784
What is she talking about?

742
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:43,388
I think she wants me to rub olive
oil on your taint.

743
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,633
Is it cool if maybe I just spray a
little PAM down in that area,

744
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:51,376
right before the baby comes out?

745
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:53,979
You have to admit it's a valid suggestion.

746
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,282
So,are you pissed that no one ever married you?

747
00:41:57,362 --> 00:42:00,386
Well,I almost got married once to
a guy named Scott.

748
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:02,998
We were together for six and a half years.

749
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:04,970
Damn,just shy of common-law.

750
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,204
Yeah,actually. He was the only guy
I ever lived with.

751
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:12,088
So now he has three kids,beautiful kids,
with another woman,

752
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,420
an old co-worker of mine,actually.

753
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,392
That sucks.

754
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:17,524
You know what? Don't worry about it,

755
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:20,697
cause you're super-successful,
and you have sweet-ass legs.

756
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:22,969
Thank you,I think.

757
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:24,951
I had one good boyfriend before Carl.

758
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:26,073
Really?

759
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:27,644
Donny Landis.

760
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,657
We used to work at Blimpie together
when we were 16,

761
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:32,790
and sit and eat pickles in the back.

762
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,564
He waited a whole month before
he touched my boobs.

763
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,336
Then he went to the University of Scranton,

764
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:40,808
and I never heard from him again.

765
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:42,910
He was my Justin Timberlake.

766
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,953
Angie,you can still have a totally
different life.

767
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,965
You're a very smart person.

768
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,086
Thanks.

769
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,832
I figured out how to beat you at
this game,by the way.

770
00:42:53,912 --> 00:42:55,404
Yeah,that's what it's about.

771
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,536
There's a lot of techniques that you can use.

772
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,349
# I come home in the morning light #

773
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:04,924
# My mother says When you gonna live
your life right? #

774
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:06,335
You gotta hold the note till the end.

775
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:08,928
# We're not the fortunate ones #

776
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:12,381
# And girls just want to have fun #

777
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:17,417
# Oh,girls just want to have fun #

778
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:19,519
Come on,get up here.

779
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,121
# Just wanna,they just wanna #

780
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,393
# Just wanna,they just wanna #

781
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:25,065
# They just wanna,they just wanna #

782
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,077
# They just wanna,they just wanna #

783
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:29,049
- # Girls! #  - # Girls! #

784
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,051
# Girls just wanna have fun #

785
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:35,786
# Girls just wanna have fun #

786
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:38,229
I think that was harmony.

787
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,671
That was harmony!

788
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:44,475
Look at her. She's got good jugs.

789
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:46,377
My avatar is dressed like a whore.

790
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,352
So,what do you wanna talk about,Carl?

791
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:14,637
I want you to come home. Baby,I miss you.

792
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:16,409
I haven't had sex in two weeks.

793
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,501
I've been gone a month.

794
00:44:18,581 --> 00:44:19,572
Whatever.

795
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:21,714
Carl,after spending time with Kate,

796
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:24,587
I kind of feel like I can evaluate
the direction my life is going,

797
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:28,462
and I feel like that direction does
not include you. Carl!

798
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,004
You and your best friend,Kate?
I got bad news.

799
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:33,167
She's using you to have a baby.

800
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,219
You think you guys would be friends
in real life?

801
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,742
She's a business lady. It's just business.

802
00:44:40,564 --> 00:44:42,026
You don't even know her,Carl.

803
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,468
All right,you got no right to cut
me out of this deal.

804
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:45,560
Who's the one who said you should go

805
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,333
into the baby-making business in
the first place? Me.

806
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:51,506
When the pee-stick said no,who's the one
who figured out how to keep things going?

807
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:53,047
Me.

808
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:55,610
- You should...  - Here you go.

809
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,024
You shouldn't have forged that
pregnancy test,Carl.

810
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:03,338
Maybe you should've actually gotten
pregnant like you were supposed to.

811
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:06,472
You did a dumb thing,moving in with
that lady. Real dumb.

812
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:08,143
We were supposed to forge the test,

813
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:09,985
send her the ultrasound picture in the mail,

814
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:12,388
and then cash the checks. One,two,three.

815
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,860
The ultrasound looked like a squirrel,
by the way.

816
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:17,964
Cause it was a squirrel.
That's all I could find on the Internet.

817
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:21,738
Look,Katie's gonna notice.
You're not getting bigger.

818
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,009
When you go to the doctor's office,

819
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,482
and you take the test,she's gonna know.

820
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:28,855
Sweetie,you're not smart enough
to pull this off.

821
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,513
Excuse me. These are mine,right?

822
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,776
How far along are you?

823
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:40,678
I'm pretty pregnant.

824
00:45:40,748 --> 00:45:42,349
She's 14 weeks.

825
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,554
Me,too! You're so lucky. You're not
showing at all.

826
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:48,466
Nice talking to you.

827
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:16,956
Angie?

828
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:20,359
I'm going to work. Feel better,okay?

829
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,062
I'm done. No. I'm not done!

830
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,166
Morning sickness.

831
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,267
Sounds like she's dying.

832
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:30,410
Just so pregnant.

833
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:37,157
Right there.

834
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:38,258
What?

835
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,930
- On your hand.  - Where?

836
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,632
- Right... Yup... See. Right.
- Where?

837
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:45,076
Girl,that's vomit!

838
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:47,248
Do something about them vomit chunks,girl!

839
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,789
Okay. God!

840
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:05,257
I love it,Kate.

841
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,991
I wanna reward you with five
minutes of uninterrupted eye contact.

842
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:10,052
Yay.

843
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,420
You can stay,Rick,if you... Okay.

844
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:54,589
In the last 24 hours,I got clearances
on the titles and the permits,

845
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:57,962
tax-incentive grants from the
city and the states,

846
00:47:58,032 --> 00:48:01,766
and Barry on the plane to surf camp.

847
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:02,867
I'm at the top of my game.

848
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:04,499
That's great!

849
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,782
Let's do something. Let's celebrate!

850
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:10,686
I thought we could order food and
watch this DVD that I got.

851
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:13,228
It's a British documentary about a woman

852
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:17,203
who gives birth to a 15-pound baby,vaginally.

853
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:20,206
Can't wait to not watch this.
You and I need to go out.

854
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:22,148
- Let's go clubbing.  - Clubbing?

855
00:48:22,218 --> 00:48:25,742
You need to get out of your comfort zone.
Go meet some dudes.

856
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:28,484
Although,I do have a new ginger
body splash that I've been dying to try.

857
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:29,726
- Wow!  - Yes.

858
00:48:29,796 --> 00:48:31,428
That's really frisky. Let's do it.

859
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:33,860
# Congratulations! #

860
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:00,718
You're wearing that?

861
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:03,261
Well,we are going to a nightclub.

862
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:18,427
Ain't no good gonna come of this.

863
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,887
This place is awesome.

864
00:49:27,947 --> 00:49:32,152
I haven't been to a place like this
since ever.

865
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:37,637
Okay. She'll have a double margarita,
no ice,and two of those.

866
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:41,571
And I'll have a bottle of water.

867
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:45,275
- Hey,let's dance!  - Okay!

868
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,643
Stop framing your face.

869
00:50:01,723 --> 00:50:02,954
Okay.

870
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:04,386
I think it's good!

871
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:05,657
It's not.

872
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:18,550
Here,drink this!

873
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:23,195
Oh,my God! That is strong.

874
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,787
Is it? Try this one.

875
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,761
That is stronger!

876
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:30,773
I know,I know. Do this shot.

877
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:33,446
Why am I doing this?

878
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,871
Are you having fun?

879
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:49,173
I am!

880
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:51,275
You know what I've always wanted to do?

881
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:53,557
This one is for the ladies!

882
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:02,547
All right! Good slow jam!

883
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:04,809
Old-school!

884
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:09,354
All right! All right! Hey! Hey!

885
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:12,457
Listen to it! It's a really beautiful song!</i>

886
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:20,075
If I was alone,I mean,not pregnant,
I would be macking on all of this.

887
00:51:20,886 --> 00:51:23,249
There's nobody here I would ever go out with.

888
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:25,851
Are you serious?

889
00:51:25,921 --> 00:51:27,823
What about that guy?

890
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,738
He looks like a laundry bag full of meat.

891
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:35,231
What about that guy over there?
He's wearing a suit.

892
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:36,302
It's denim.

893
00:51:36,382 --> 00:51:38,074
You're so picky!

894
00:51:38,154 --> 00:51:42,589
Well,at least he's not a grade-A dork
like that guy.

895
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:44,221
Oh,my God,Scott!

896
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,352
Who?

897
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:49,706
That's my ex-boyfriend,Scott,
that I told you about. Why is he here?

898
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:51,038
You went out with him?

899
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,339
I did.

900
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,751
Why?

901
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:55,312
He's beautiful.

902
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,655
Where? Look at his mustache!

903
00:51:57,725 --> 00:51:59,627
I know!

904
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:00,718
I'm gonna go say hi.

905
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,561
No,don't,it's a bad...

906
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:06,134
Kate,I'm gonna watch your drink.

907
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:11,439
Hi,Scott.

908
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:14,513
Kate,my gosh,you look great!
What are you doing here?

909
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:16,495
I'm just clubbing.

910
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:18,086
You remember my wife,Jean?

911
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,258
Oh,yeah.

912
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:21,400
Hi,Jean,how are you?

913
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:23,842
How's everything?

914
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:26,816
It's great. We just bought a
house in Bucks County.

915
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:29,789
I'm still doing stuff for Doctors
Without Borders.

916
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:33,563
Recently,we took in some Hurricane
Katrina dogs.

917
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:37,297
And I was in a bicycle accident
that made my penis bigger.

918
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:39,429
How are you?

919
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:41,311
I'm doing awesome.

920
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:46,416
I've just been working a lot,
and I cannot have babies,it turns out.

921
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,859
So,good job picking this one.

922
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:53,394
What it is,actually,is my uterus
is T-shaped,which is like...

923
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:56,637
So,but actually,funny story. See that...

924
00:52:56,717 --> 00:52:58,649
Okay,see that little blonde woman,over here?

925
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,212
- I am paying her to have...
- Hi. Stop talking now.

926
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:02,844
Bye,Jean.

927
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:06,357
Why does he make me so crazy?

928
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:08,429
Forget about him. He dumped you.
He's an asshole.

929
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,271
No,he's a good person.

930
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,474
No,you're a good person.

931
00:53:12,544 --> 00:53:15,106
You don't need another good
person around you. That's your thing.

932
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:16,618
He's trying to take that from you!

933
00:53:16,688 --> 00:53:19,591
He wanted to marry me,and I wanted
to focus on work.

934
00:53:19,661 --> 00:53:21,093
Of course you did!

935
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:24,496
Because working is awesome and
being married sucks!

936
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:26,228
That's his car.

937
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:27,800
- What,this right here?  - Yes.

938
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,343
Silver Infiniti,Penn State sticker,

939
00:53:30,413 --> 00:53:32,074
baseball mitt in the backseat...

940
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:35,818
This is Scott. You know what we should do?

941
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,622
Yeah!

942
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:43,406
I was gonna say leave a funny note!

943
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:50,884
Where are we?

944
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:52,015
WeBeSoCa.

945
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,588
What? You're so wasted.

946
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:01,646
Stop right here! This is good.
Pull over right here.

947
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:04,739
Angie,I'm gonna go get a ginger carrot juice,

948
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:06,411
and you should go home and get some rest,

949
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:09,794
because you look very sleepy and tired.

950
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:15,810
Where are you going?

951
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:19,244
We're closed!

952
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:22,948
Yeah,well,it looks about the
same as when you're open.

953
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:29,795
Don't tell me,your people are gonna
start bulldozing the neighborhood tonight.

954
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:33,139
Yeah,I'm... I'm really,really sorry

955
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:36,152
that I'm so good at my job.

956
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:38,084
What is this,a taste test?

957
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:41,087
No,actually,I wouldn't do that if I were you.

958
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:43,820
No,that... That's not...

959
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,592
- It's horrible.  - Not very good.

960
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:49,266
It's a combination of papaya juice and coffee.

961
00:54:49,346 --> 00:54:51,648
I keep this notepad by my bed in
the middle of the night,

962
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:53,680
and I write down these ideas
when I'm half asleep,

963
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,242
and they never make any sense.

964
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:56,694
I do that,too.

965
00:54:56,764 --> 00:55:00,287
And then I wake up,and I have
these little notes that say things like,

966
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:04,742
"make everybody be twins" and
"electric toilet."

967
00:55:04,812 --> 00:55:06,874
Those are not good ideas.

968
00:55:06,944 --> 00:55:08,106
They're really not.

969
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:14,592
So why are you out so late?
Are you a prostitute at night,or...

970
00:55:14,662 --> 00:55:16,354
No.

971
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:20,198
I went out tonight for the first time
in a long time,

972
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:23,041
and I let a friend of mine dress me.

973
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:26,475
Well,your friend is a great American.

974
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:28,077
Sorry.

975
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,557
You know,I really like your logo.

976
00:55:47,627 --> 00:55:48,858
Yeah?

977
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,231
Yeah,I did it myself.

978
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:52,933
I really like it.

979
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:57,948
You don't think it looks like a penis?

980
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:01,151
- No,I don't see that.
- No?

981
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:02,253
No,I don't see that.

982
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:05,926
Over here you got two obvious...

983
00:56:05,997 --> 00:56:07,899
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- ...stiff ones... No?

984
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,171
No,I don't know what you're talking about.

985
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:15,787
You're being nice. Thank you.

986
00:56:15,857 --> 00:56:18,550
Also,I don't think you wanna pick
a fight with Jamba Juice.

987
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,091
I mean,they're not exactly Wal-Mart.

988
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:23,795
Well,they are. They're the Exxon
of frozen juice companies.

989
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:27,539
Yes,I think I saw a Michael Moore
documentary about that.

990
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,703
That's embarrassing.

991
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:34,817
So is that offer to get together
some time still on the table?

992
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:37,520
Are you asking me out?

993
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,762
Yes,I think I am.

994
00:56:39,832 --> 00:56:42,205
Okay,yes,then,yes. Yeah.

995
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:43,336
Great.

996
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:45,348
This came off my head.

997
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:46,609
Some of that hair's real,right?

998
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:49,122
No. I'm bald. I'm...

999
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:52,025
These are real.
So we got that going for us.

1000
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,302
Hi,Carl.

1001
00:56:58,372 --> 00:56:59,673
What's up,hot stuff?

1002
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:02,076
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay away from me.

1003
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:04,088
You think you're getting this
payday without me?

1004
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:06,620
No way. I want my half,okay?

1005
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,353
And I've got insurance,the actual pee-stick.

1006
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:11,496
I don't even know if that's real.
You probably peed on it.

1007
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:13,798
Maybe I did,maybe I didn't.
But I'll tell you this.

1008
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:14,899
It's gonna raise a lot of questions

1009
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:16,070
when Kate takes this down to the lab,

1010
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,082
and they start doing DNA tests with CSI stuff,

1011
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:19,984
and molecules and proteins and the
hair follicles,

1012
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:21,386
and they're gonna connect the dots.

1013
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:22,817
And then you're gonna be busted.

1014
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:25,861
Carl,I don't wanna do any of this anymore.

1015
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:29,324
I want a common-law divorce.

1016
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,708
You wanna give me back the ring
that I made for you in metal shop?

1017
00:57:32,778 --> 00:57:34,440
Yeah,I do.

1018
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,712
Okay,you know what? I'll tell
you when this relationship's over,

1019
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:38,484
because there's a lot of girls
there sitting on the bench

1020
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:40,756
that wanna come into this game,all right?

1021
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:44,530
So I am canceling this relationship,okay?

1022
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:47,604
- Please come back to me,Angie.
- Oh,my God!

1023
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:50,146
Wait,wait! Hold on,hold on,please!

1024
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,211
I wanna say goodbye to you proper,
okay? We owe that to one another.

1025
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:56,223
Can we please have a quickie in the car?

1026
00:57:56,293 --> 00:57:57,664
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

1027
00:57:57,734 --> 00:58:01,869
You know what? I'm not gonna
be here for you when Kate kicks you out.

1028
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:03,771
So deal with that.

1029
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:07,645
My girl rocks? My girl does not rock,okay?

1030
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:09,306
My girl is a divorced.

1031
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:10,908
So I hope you got Kleenex,

1032
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:15,093
'cause you just said goodbye to the
coolest thing that ever happened to you.

1033
00:58:18,576 --> 00:58:22,210
I'm gonna bang your friends.
Consider them all banged.

1034
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:03,584
The reason I called you collect is 'cause
it's gonna take more than a few quarters

1035
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:06,437
to express how I feel about you,baby.

1036
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,529
Hey,where you going?

1037
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:16,227
I knew something was up when
I saw you beating your baby bump like that.

1038
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:20,031
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

1039
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,864
Everything just got way out of hand.

1040
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:30,652
I think I'm just gonna split.

1041
00:59:30,722 --> 00:59:32,124
That's a good idea.

1042
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,525
Just slip away in the dead of night

1043
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:35,117
and leave Kate thinking you stole the baby.

1044
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,689
That would destroy her.

1045
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,361
This ain't some little scam where
you just call up Domino's and be like,

1046
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:43,436
"Yo. You know,I'm doing some church
youth event. I need 10 free pizzas."

1047
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:44,877
Why,does that work?

1048
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:48,411
You're lying about the existence
of a human being.

1049
00:59:48,491 --> 00:59:52,455
If you don't tell her,you'll never
be able to live with yourself.

1050
00:59:52,535 --> 00:59:54,557
Maybe you can tell her after I'm gone.

1051
00:59:54,637 --> 00:59:56,329
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1052
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:58,772
Not a damn thing,'cause you're
gonna tell her yourself.

1053
01:00:03,156 --> 01:00:05,489
I've got a surprise for you.

1054
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:07,121
I got a surprise for you,too.

1055
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:11,195
It is a brochure for the Philadelphia
School of Textiles.

1056
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,997
They've got a great fashion program.

1057
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,168
Thanks.

1058
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,311
But that's not the whole surprise. Open it.

1059
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:19,514
I'm giving you your check early.

1060
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:23,998
No,Kate. I can't take that.
You gotta put that through the agency.

1061
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:27,162
No,it's not gonna bounce. Don't you trust me?

1062
01:00:33,148 --> 01:00:34,409
Where are we going?

1063
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:35,851
You have an ultrasound appointment.

1064
01:00:35,921 --> 01:00:38,914
What? No. Today's Thursday.

1065
01:00:38,994 --> 01:00:41,297
Ultrasound isn't Thursday.
Birthing class is Thursday.

1066
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:44,670
Usually,but you're 18 weeks,
and so you have another ultrasound.

1067
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,572
I can't wait.

1068
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,545
I hope the baby's in a good position,
so we can see its little profile,

1069
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:53,059
because I'd really like to get
one of those printouts to hang over my desk.

1070
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,180
Do you think it could look like me yet?

1071
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,563
Could the baby look like you at 18 weeks?

1072
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:59,366
What if it has little tiny glasses?

1073
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,241
I'm joking. That's me trying to make a joke.

1074
01:01:04,982 --> 01:01:06,643
- That's cold.
- Sorry about that.

1075
01:01:06,713 --> 01:01:08,055
Just...

1076
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:18,966
lf... When you get mad,do you
stay mad for a long time?

1077
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:22,910
Yes,yes. I'm a big grudge-holder,actually.

1078
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,923
- Hear that?  - What?

1079
01:01:24,993 --> 01:01:27,685
That's your heartbeat. You nervous?

1080
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:29,257
Yeah,a little.

1081
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:33,602
Okay,I'm just...
Just having a little trouble finding...

1082
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:35,434
You're gonna have a lot of trouble.

1083
01:01:35,514 --> 01:01:38,417
Kate,I gotta tell you something.
I'm not really...

1084
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,209
There's the baby's heartbeat.

1085
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,362
- I'm not really... What?
- Isn't it wonderful?

1086
01:01:43,422 --> 01:01:44,413
Holy shit!

1087
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,295
- There's a baby in there?  - Yep!

1088
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:48,457
- How did it get in there?
- It's a miracle.

1089
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:50,770
What did you wanna tell me?

1090
01:01:51,881 --> 01:01:54,143
I'm so excited.

1091
01:01:55,154 --> 01:01:56,246
Yay!

1092
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:02,392
What do you mean,pregnant?
I thought you was lying to Kate.

1093
01:02:02,462 --> 01:02:07,537
I was. I am. It's not Kate's baby.
It's Carl's.

1094
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:08,599
So the procedure thing...

1095
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,481
Didn't take.

1096
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:12,613
And then I was crying,so Carl and I did it.

1097
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:14,154
And it's just country.

1098
01:02:14,224 --> 01:02:15,486
I missed a couple periods,

1099
01:02:15,556 --> 01:02:18,029
and I thought maybe it was my hormones,
you know what I'm talking about?

1100
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:19,220
No,I don't know nothing about that.

1101
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,432
But then I started spotting,
and I thought that was my period,

1102
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:22,804
but usually I don't have a heavy flow.

1103
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:24,676
Stop it.

1104
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:28,149
My boobs didn't hurt,so I was like,
"It's not my period..."

1105
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,582
You know what? Look,I'm just gonna
lay it out,all right?

1106
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:32,123
I'm not discussing the lady business with you.

1107
01:02:32,193 --> 01:02:33,855
I mean,I think it's a beautiful
thing and all that,

1108
01:02:33,925 --> 01:02:35,627
but it's disgusting,okay?

1109
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:37,299
And I'm afraid if we keep talking about it,

1110
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:40,362
that our cycles might synchronize...

1111
01:02:40,442 --> 01:02:43,275
What am I supposed to do,Oscar?

1112
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:47,119
I can't cash that check.
I can't take any of Kate's money.

1113
01:02:47,189 --> 01:02:50,633
But I am gonna stay here until
I figure out what to do.

1114
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:52,925
I don't know anything about being a mother.

1115
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:54,737
You better start learning.

1116
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:56,940
It's good if the kid's raised here,
though,you know?

1117
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:00,954
Better school,better apartment,
better situation.

1118
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:05,388
Is that what you want?

1119
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,632
No,I wanna keep it.

1120
01:03:12,976 --> 01:03:14,498
Have you read this?

1121
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:19,423
"One in four million babies are
born with a full set of teeth."

1122
01:03:19,493 --> 01:03:21,826
Angie,it's gonna be fine.

1123
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:22,887
Where you going?

1124
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,699
I have a date with that guy,Rob.

1125
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:25,860
Are you gonna tell him about me?

1126
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,062
No. I've made that mistake before.

1127
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:29,634
It turns out they don't like it

1128
01:03:29,714 --> 01:03:33,878
when you talk about the successful
transfer of embryos on the first date.

1129
01:03:33,948 --> 01:03:38,123
Read the chapter about hermaphrodites.
You won't sleep for a week.

1130
01:03:39,464 --> 01:03:42,127
Hello,folks,my name is Chet.
I'm your waiter.

1131
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:45,641
Are you folks familiar with the
raw food vegan movement?

1132
01:03:45,711 --> 01:03:47,202
- Yeah.  - I think he is,more than I am.

1133
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:48,744
Yeah,yeah.

1134
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:50,946
Okay,should we start with some appetizers?

1135
01:03:51,016 --> 01:03:54,550
Yeah. How's the sea kelp pizza?

1136
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,103
That's got a nice earthy taste,
little bit of a dirt taste.

1137
01:03:57,163 --> 01:03:58,935
It's very nice.

1138
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:01,598
Salty. We'll stay away from that.

1139
01:04:01,678 --> 01:04:03,149
You know what looks good is the blue algae?

1140
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:05,011
- You wanna just...
- Yes,yes.

1141
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:06,102
Excellent. Be right back.

1142
01:04:09,656 --> 01:04:11,488
So what kind of law did you practice?

1143
01:04:11,568 --> 01:04:14,661
Corporate. You know when you're
watching the news,

1144
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:17,334
and you see some bloated CEO involved
in a scandal,

1145
01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:18,465
and you kind of wonder to yourself,

1146
01:04:18,545 --> 01:04:21,348
"How is this prick not going
straight to jail?"

1147
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:23,751
Sometimes it was because of me.

1148
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:25,753
You must be very proud.

1149
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,555
All right,here's your blue-green algae

1150
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:29,687
and a yeast bowl for the table.

1151
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:30,788
- Thank you.  - Thanks.

1152
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,630
This looks good.

1153
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,502
- Oh,it's warm.  - Yeah.

1154
01:04:36,384 --> 01:04:39,317
What about you? You like your work?

1155
01:04:39,387 --> 01:04:41,319
I do,but I mean,

1156
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,832
I have other things in my life besides my job.

1157
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:46,455
I like to travel for work.

1158
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,138
Oh,that's a...

1159
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:52,111
That's a good yeast.

1160
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:54,513
Very yeasty.

1161
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,046
How long have you been vegan?

1162
01:04:57,557 --> 01:04:59,389
I'm not.

1163
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:02,592
I'm sorry. I'm not,I thought that you were,

1164
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:03,933
and that's why I took you here.

1165
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:07,207
Because of where you work,
I never would have... Oh,God.

1166
01:05:07,277 --> 01:05:09,249
- Can we... Yeah,you want to...
- I eat meat.

1167
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,871
Yeah,I eat meat like nobody's business.

1168
01:05:13,223 --> 01:05:16,316
I'll have a large steak with
provolone,no Cheez Whiz,no onions,

1169
01:05:16,396 --> 01:05:18,429
peppers on the side,don't overcook the meat.

1170
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:20,991
Also,I'd like you to slice me a
new fresh roll,

1171
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,873
because those ones have been
sitting out for a long time.

1172
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,206
I want a Birch Beer,cold,no cup.

1173
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:28,079
You really should consider changing
those Styrofoam cups to paper ones,

1174
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,451
because they're very bad for the environment.

1175
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:32,553
Yeah,I'll have the same.

1176
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:34,826
I'm sorry. I'm a little overly thorough.

1177
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:37,809
Some people would say that I am
bossy and controlling.

1178
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:39,771
No,that's just prejudice.

1179
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:41,643
They call you bossy and controlling
'cause you're a woman.

1180
01:05:41,713 --> 01:05:46,388
But if you were a man doing the
same stuff,you'd just be a dick.

1181
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,550
What?

1182
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,651
Nothing.

1183
01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:53,065
No one's ever called me a dick
before on a date.

1184
01:05:53,135 --> 01:05:55,127
Term of endearment.

1185
01:05:55,207 --> 01:05:59,482
So listen,there's something that
I haven't told you.

1186
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:04,047
And it may be a deal-breaker.

1187
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:06,519
Oh,boy,you are super fruity,aren't you?

1188
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:07,690
No.

1189
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:10,794
But I do have a daughter.

1190
01:06:11,474 --> 01:06:15,509
She's 12 years old and she lives
with me every other weekend.

1191
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,322
I think that's great.

1192
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:19,453
Yeah?

1193
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:23,467
Okay. You have any kids?

1194
01:06:23,597 --> 01:06:25,729
I've never been married.

1195
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,633
Well,Kate,

1196
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,717
you don't have to be married to have a kid.

1197
01:06:47,312 --> 01:06:48,303
Do you want to go back to my...

1198
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:50,115
Yes.

1199
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:51,417
I was going to say apartment,
just to be clear.

1200
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:53,329
Yeah. I'm 37. I know how this works.

1201
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:54,420
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1202
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,592
It's actually this way.

1203
01:06:56,672 --> 01:06:57,933
Okay.

1204
01:07:02,378 --> 01:07:04,250
- 1406.
- Yeah.

1205
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,842
Oh,no. No,no,no.

1206
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:09,756
Look who just got inducted into
the walk of shame.

1207
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:12,859
Why are you all shiny like a soul food cook?

1208
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:14,761
I want you,now,

1209
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:17,334
to look your partner in the eye,
and I want you to tell her

1210
01:07:17,444 --> 01:07:20,147
she is beautiful.

1211
01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:23,220
You are beautiful.

1212
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,953
Tell her,"You are strong."

1213
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:27,354
You are strong.

1214
01:07:27,435 --> 01:07:32,470
Tell her,"Thank you for giving me this baby."

1215
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,033
Thank you for giving me this baby.

1216
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:39,317
- Are you crying?  - No.

1217
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:43,792
I am. I'm crying a little bit.

1218
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:46,925
All right.

1219
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:51,510
Romaine,Cheyenne,time to go.

1220
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,613
We have a playdate with Wingspan and Banjo.

1221
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:58,828
Those kids would have got their
asses handed to them in my neighborhood.

1222
01:07:58,898 --> 01:08:02,031
My sister wants to know what
kind of cake you want for the shower.

1223
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,903
Kate,I don't think I should go to that,
you know?

1224
01:08:03,973 --> 01:08:05,905
I mean,that's just kind of for you.

1225
01:08:05,975 --> 01:08:07,347
No,it's for both of us.

1226
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,650
My mother wants to meet you and
make you feel weird.

1227
01:08:12,062 --> 01:08:13,583
Excuse me.

1228
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:16,526
Yes. Barry,hi.

1229
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:19,089
No,I'm pulling into the construction
site right now.

1230
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,901
Think I went to a rave here once.

1231
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,312
Please,I asked you to wait in the car.

1232
01:08:22,382 --> 01:08:23,363
It's too hot in there,

1233
01:08:23,444 --> 01:08:25,546
and your weirdo air conditioning,
I don't know how to work it.

1234
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:27,177
- Barry,I'm sorry.  - Kate,where you been?

1235
01:08:27,258 --> 01:08:29,280
I'm having second thoughts
about this location.

1236
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,381
Is it the taxes?

1237
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:32,994
It's probably because this place
gives you a weird vibe,right?

1238
01:08:33,064 --> 01:08:35,296
Yes. That one.

1239
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:38,740
I'm not getting good vibes here.

1240
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,712
And if there's one thing Oprah taught me,

1241
01:08:40,782 --> 01:08:43,114
it's to trust my instincts and
follow my fear.

1242
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:45,216
Is that the episode where she
got her ears pierced?

1243
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:48,860
No,this was at her home in Maui.
Who are you?

1244
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:49,921
I'm Angie.

1245
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:51,133
She works for me.

1246
01:08:51,203 --> 01:08:53,265
She's very intuitive.

1247
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:54,636
I read people's energies.

1248
01:08:54,706 --> 01:08:56,578
- You read energies?  - Yeah.

1249
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:02,495
Good. Very good.

1250
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:06,999
How's the energy in this site?

1251
01:09:09,742 --> 01:09:11,975
Green,mostly.

1252
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:15,288
Like healthy leaves.

1253
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,792
Money?

1254
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:21,565
Exactly.

1255
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:22,936
I like your maid.

1256
01:09:23,006 --> 01:09:24,027
So do I.

1257
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:25,729
Let me put my hands into your hands,

1258
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:27,941
and I'll whisper to you the secret of success.

1259
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:39,003
So,are we back on?

1260
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:40,765
We were never off.

1261
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:42,196
What did he say?

1262
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,398
The secret of success.

1263
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:44,469
And?

1264
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:45,710
He said "Have a big penis."

1265
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,482
- No,he didn't.  - Yeah,he did.

1266
01:10:48,106 --> 01:10:51,019
Oh,my God!

1267
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,251
Oh,my God. Look! Wait.

1268
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:55,123
- Is that the face?  - I think.

1269
01:10:55,193 --> 01:10:57,556
That was a big one!

1270
01:10:57,926 --> 01:11:00,369
Oh,my God. What does it feel like?

1271
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,132
Like if you ate a meatball sandwich,

1272
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:05,574
then that meatball sandwich was
kicking you.

1273
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:09,248
I think I gotta tell Rob about
you and the baby.

1274
01:11:09,318 --> 01:11:10,349
What? Why?

1275
01:11:10,419 --> 01:11:11,521
Well,we've been going out for a month,

1276
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:13,723
and I didn't think it would turn
into anything,

1277
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:14,784
but it sort of is.

1278
01:11:14,864 --> 01:11:16,396
I don't think that's a good idea.

1279
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:18,338
You know,he may break up with you.

1280
01:11:18,468 --> 01:11:21,571
Yeah,but the longer I wait,
the weirder it's gonna be.

1281
01:11:21,641 --> 01:11:23,313
It's gonna be weird no matter what.

1282
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:26,516
He'll know I'm hiding something.
I'm the worst liar.

1283
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:29,720
Okay,tell me three things about
yourself and make one of them a lie.

1284
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,131
Okay.

1285
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:33,504
I'm from Pennsylvania,

1286
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:36,977
I am a Leo,and I am 5'9".

1287
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,582
I don't want to... This is why
I can't lie to him.

1288
01:11:41,652 --> 01:11:43,214
You're not lying to him,

1289
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:45,757
you're just not telling him the truth,
there's a big difference.

1290
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,298
Is there?

1291
01:11:47,829 --> 01:11:50,061
I don't know. Don't ask me.

1292
01:11:57,919 --> 01:12:01,363
# Don't speak I can't even take it. #

1293
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:04,486
# And I don't need no reason. #

1294
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,539
Hi.

1295
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:09,442
I'm Rob. I'm here to pick up Kate.

1296
01:12:09,512 --> 01:12:10,503
Oh!

1297
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:16,419
Sorry,I'm a little early.
I was just in the neighborhood,so...

1298
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:18,181
Do come in.

1299
01:12:21,564 --> 01:12:23,056
Hello,I'm Angela.

1300
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:24,167
Okay.

1301
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:27,611
I'm Kate's sister,so...

1302
01:12:28,382 --> 01:12:30,914
We are in the same family.

1303
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:36,991
And I was just practicing the
ancient Japanese art of karaoke.

1304
01:12:37,872 --> 01:12:39,363
- Karaoke?  - Yes.

1305
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:43,207
You delightful... Hello. Oh,well.

1306
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:46,581
I can see how she likes you so much. Kate?

1307
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:47,982
- You live here?  - No,

1308
01:12:48,052 --> 01:12:49,394
no.

1309
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:53,698
I live in New York City in a
pied-terre apartment

1310
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,861
with a husband that I have.

1311
01:12:57,442 --> 01:13:01,176
Wow,so you're just kind of visiting here,or...

1312
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:02,908
He's in the stock market.

1313
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:08,224
So we go from city to city,visiting
other stock markets.

1314
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:10,466
And that's how we roll.

1315
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:12,168
It's funny,'cause you guys don't
look alike at all.

1316
01:13:12,268 --> 01:13:13,669
Oh,well.

1317
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,341
- Different dads?  - Yes.

1318
01:13:15,441 --> 01:13:17,213
We have different dads.
That's what we have.

1319
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:19,916
We have different dads. Thank you for that.

1320
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,958
Is that my phone?

1321
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,360
I didn't actually hear...

1322
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,873
It was. Hold on,it's from Europe. Hello?

1323
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:37,444
Yes,interesting. It's a business call.
So nice to meet you.

1324
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:39,487
- What?  - Yes.

1325
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:42,700
What? How long did he talk to you?

1326
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:46,304
Hi. Look at you,early bird.

1327
01:13:46,374 --> 01:13:48,346
Okay,it's nice to see you.

1328
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,647
Oh,my gosh,well,let's go.

1329
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:50,738
Yeah.

1330
01:13:50,818 --> 01:13:52,340
Does your sister want to come with us?

1331
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,552
No,she's not well.

1332
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,925
- Bye,Angela.  - Adios.

1333
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,668
Push,woman.

1334
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:04,112
Yeah,good. Push,and boom! Congratulations.
Look.

1335
01:14:04,183 --> 01:14:06,305
Popcorn.

1336
01:14:06,385 --> 01:14:07,446
See?

1337
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:10,820
It's that easy. What movie we watching?

1338
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,933
Extreme Vaginal Delivery.

1339
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:16,896
The miracle of really big childbirth.

1340
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,600
Oh,damn!

1341
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,642
You can't come back from that.

1342
01:14:24,284 --> 01:14:26,626
That's why you always want to stay
over here,huh?

1343
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,628
- It's one of the reasons.  - Well,

1344
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:30,821
how long is your sister in town?

1345
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,532
Angie's not really my sister.

1346
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:36,046
I know. She's your half-sister.
She told me.

1347
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:39,950
What else did Angela tell you?

1348
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:41,722
Well,

1349
01:14:42,893 --> 01:14:45,026
she told me that you like me a lot.

1350
01:14:45,096 --> 01:14:47,859
Well,she's a liar. She's a known liar.

1351
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:48,930
What is this?

1352
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,445
Jillian wants me to take her to an
exhibit of abnormal skulls at the Minster Museum.

1353
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:56,948
Do you need me to get out of here?

1354
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:58,990
No,no. No,I was gonna see if you
wanted to come.

1355
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,362
You want me to meet your daughter?

1356
01:15:00,432 --> 01:15:02,594
Is that a bad idea?

1357
01:15:02,704 --> 01:15:06,328
No. I really,really like kids.

1358
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:10,312
- Oh,my God.  - Oh,I know.

1359
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,545
Have you read this article?

1360
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,987
This Chaffee Backnell lady.

1361
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,290
- Bicknell.  - She is a piece of work.

1362
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,995
I mean,her whole surrogacy process
is very science-fictiony.

1363
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:23,736
There's so many kids that need to be adopted.

1364
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:25,108
Well,adoption can take years.

1365
01:15:25,178 --> 01:15:29,452
And these people would pay,like,
you know,$50,000,in order to...

1366
01:15:29,522 --> 01:15:30,924
It's $100,000,actually.

1367
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:34,898
You know,have your baby custom-carried
by a gestation assistant.

1368
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:35,989
What is that?

1369
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:38,802
Well,I think it's probably more
complicated than it seems.

1370
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:40,704
A lot of rich people getting what they want.

1371
01:15:42,476 --> 01:15:45,079
I hate that song.

1372
01:15:49,223 --> 01:15:51,195
Here you go. You got it?  - Yeah,I'm good.

1373
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:52,256
So,do you feel good about yourself?

1374
01:15:52,367 --> 01:15:55,069
You're just going to let Kate go
ahead and have this whole baby shower,right?

1375
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:57,542
You don't realize how ruthless that is,right?

1376
01:15:57,612 --> 01:16:00,105
Hey,man,that's a sweet cake.
That's tight. That's tight.

1377
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,706
Service entrance,straight to the terrace.

1378
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:02,777
What am I supposed to do?

1379
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,330
Tell her today,in front of all of
her friends and her family?

1380
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:07,492
No,no,no. Wait till the child is,
like,nine years old,

1381
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,264
and then tell her,like my first ex did me.

1382
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:11,997
Okay,I'm going to tell her tonight.

1383
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:13,909
Or Monday.

1384
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:17,183
But then it'll ruin her week,
so maybe I should wait till Friday.

1385
01:16:17,283 --> 01:16:19,315
Then it would ruin her weekend,
so maybe I should...

1386
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:21,157
I don't know when I'm gonna tell her.

1387
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,359
When's the best day to tell someone
horrible news?

1388
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:24,460
Yesterday.

1389
01:16:27,243 --> 01:16:30,036
I tell you,a pagan birth is a
fascinating thing.

1390
01:16:30,116 --> 01:16:31,548
You know,now that I've done it myself,

1391
01:16:31,618 --> 01:16:34,020
it seems crazy not to eat the placenta.

1392
01:16:34,821 --> 01:16:36,813
I'm sorry,did you say polenta or placenta?

1393
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,086
Placenta,the afterbirth,yeah.

1394
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,759
Ashley turned us onto it...

1395
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:45,673
Angie.

1396
01:16:45,913 --> 01:16:47,545
Hi,I'm Caroline,

1397
01:16:47,615 --> 01:16:50,177
- Kate's sister. Nice to meet you.
- Hi,nice to meet you.

1398
01:16:50,258 --> 01:16:52,380
And this is our mother,Rose.

1399
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,581
Hi,nice to meet you.

1400
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:54,722
How do you do?

1401
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,195
So,tell me,once the baby is born,

1402
01:16:57,265 --> 01:17:00,829
will you just go away,
or shall I expect you at Christmas?

1403
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:01,930
Mom.

1404
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:03,031
What?

1405
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:06,675
This is a reasonable question.
All my friends are asking.

1406
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,417
Well,we haven't really talked about it.

1407
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:10,048
No,there's not a lot of stuff
we've talked about,

1408
01:17:10,128 --> 01:17:11,790
we have a lot of stuff to talk about.

1409
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,563
I think Angie might want to visit
the baby a few times a year.

1410
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:17,636
You know,or I might be out of town,
I don't know where I'm going.

1411
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:20,409
I mean,I think I've got plans,
but I'll definitely call.

1412
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,212
Summer,if we're on vacation,maybe Angie
would want to come with us some time.

1413
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:24,514
And who knows where we're going
to be in a year?

1414
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:26,996
I think it's really important that
she remain a part of the baby's life.

1415
01:17:27,066 --> 01:17:29,729
Yeah,you know,or completely separate.

1416
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:31,201
We're just going to play it fast and loose,

1417
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:34,644
you know,just see how it all shakes out.

1418
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:35,936
Always been my motto.

1419
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:52,143
- Rob? Hi.  - Hi.

1420
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,585
Hey,I know it's your sister's baby shower,

1421
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:57,278
just,you haven't called me in days.
I thought maybe I did something wrong.

1422
01:17:57,358 --> 01:17:59,120
No,you didn't do anything.

1423
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:00,862
Is it because I wanted to introduce
you to my kid?

1424
01:18:00,932 --> 01:18:02,424
No,Rob,I just...

1425
01:18:02,504 --> 01:18:04,696
I think you and I view the world differently.

1426
01:18:04,776 --> 01:18:07,239
Bad news people,party's over.

1427
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,871
- Start heading for the door.
- Who let him in here?

1428
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,924
Carl,don't say something stupid.

1429
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,956
Oh,She hasn't told you.

1430
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:15,688
I thought since you guys were best friends,

1431
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,029
she probably told you everything.

1432
01:18:17,099 --> 01:18:19,191
- Shut your mouth,Carl.
- What is going on?

1433
01:18:19,271 --> 01:18:21,504
She's not even pregnant,okay?

1434
01:18:21,774 --> 01:18:23,506
I mean,look.

1435
01:18:24,277 --> 01:18:26,008
Angie what is that?

1436
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:28,181
Feel it.

1437
01:18:29,762 --> 01:18:31,925
- It's moving.
- Yeah,it's a baby.

1438
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:34,397
And it's yours.

1439
01:18:34,738 --> 01:18:35,759
What are you saying?

1440
01:18:35,839 --> 01:18:36,860
Kate,

1441
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,503
I really tried to make you a baby,I swear.

1442
01:18:39,573 --> 01:18:40,674
What are you saying?

1443
01:18:40,744 --> 01:18:41,875
We took a test

1444
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:44,548
as soon as we got home,and the
procedure didn't work.

1445
01:18:44,658 --> 01:18:48,092
And I was real,you know,horny,
because of all the hormones.

1446
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:49,723
So we did it.

1447
01:18:50,034 --> 01:18:51,225
I felt like a failure.

1448
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:53,037
And Carl told me you were going
to get somebody else.

1449
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:55,800
Those hormones can also give you
a false negative.

1450
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,113
That's why they want you to wait
two weeks before you take a test.

1451
01:18:59,183 --> 01:19:01,386
- Wait,what?  - So she might not be pregnant?

1452
01:19:01,456 --> 01:19:03,518
Yo,where you escape from,man?

1453
01:19:03,598 --> 01:19:06,891
I'm saying the baby might be Carl's,
but it might still be mine.

1454
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:08,563
Okay,then forget what I said.

1455
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:09,664
I'm trying to play catch-up here.

1456
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,007
So you get your sister pregnant,

1457
01:19:12,077 --> 01:19:14,049
- but she slept with him?
- No,she's not my sister.

1458
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:18,083
She's an ignorant white trash
woman that I paid to carry my kid.

1459
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:20,556
I deserve that.

1460
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:21,617
No,you don't.

1461
01:19:21,697 --> 01:19:22,758
How could you do that?

1462
01:19:22,828 --> 01:19:24,270
This is why I didn't call you back,Rob,

1463
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,003
because this is the kind of selfish,
science fiction shit

1464
01:19:27,073 --> 01:19:28,604
that you don't want any part of.

1465
01:19:30,216 --> 01:19:33,119
Well,the upside is,it looks like I
might be a dad.

1466
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:35,662
So if it's a boy,I want to marry you.

1467
01:19:35,722 --> 01:19:36,753
Oh,my God.

1468
01:19:38,395 --> 01:19:39,626
What?

1469
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,868
I'm so sorry about what's happened.

1470
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:44,571
But I think it's best to wait
until the pregnancy is far enough along

1471
01:19:44,641 --> 01:19:47,644
for DNA testing,before we do anything drastic.

1472
01:19:49,616 --> 01:19:51,018
That was quite a kick.

1473
01:19:51,088 --> 01:19:52,179
How can you be pregnant?

1474
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:54,422
Your eggs are from the '40s.

1475
01:19:56,033 --> 01:19:57,405
You're upset.

1476
01:19:57,475 --> 01:20:00,208
And you're saying hurtful things.
It's understandable.

1477
01:20:00,608 --> 01:20:03,051
We'll have a DNA sample sent to the lab.

1478
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:05,673
The rest will be handled in family court.

1479
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:10,358
Of course,if the baby turns out
not to be yours,we'll waive our fees.

1480
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:14,162
What about all the background checks?

1481
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,675
Passed. With flying colors.

1482
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:19,808
You were living with her,and you
didn't notice anything.

1483
01:20:19,888 --> 01:20:21,610
She fooled us,Kate.

1484
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,382
She fooled us all.

1485
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:26,425
I fooled myself.

1486
01:20:38,118 --> 01:20:41,291
I booked you a room here,until
we sort this out.

1487
01:20:41,892 --> 01:20:45,095
So you're done with me,now,is that it?
You don't need me anymore?

1488
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:48,108
Gonna try to find some other lowlife
you can use

1489
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:50,080
to give you everything you ever wanted?

1490
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,582
I'm not gonna do this.

1491
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:53,143
You know,you think you're better than me...

1492
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:56,487
I am certain that I am better than you.

1493
01:20:56,927 --> 01:20:59,230
Okay,we're being honest now?

1494
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,602
Here's one. I can have a baby,and you can't.

1495
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:02,724
And that drives you crazy.

1496
01:21:02,804 --> 01:21:04,505
Get out of my car.

1497
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:09,851
Your stupid space car's locked me in.

1498
01:21:09,951 --> 01:21:12,484
Don't touch it when I'm touching it.

1499
01:21:13,225 --> 01:21:14,216
Just open it!

1500
01:21:14,296 --> 01:21:15,857
Yeah,you bang on the door,that's
how you open it.

1501
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:17,699
Well,you can't even find the stupid...

1502
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:18,790
Raised by wolves!

1503
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:19,932
Tell me how to open it!

1504
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:22,875
Stop touching it,and I will open it.

1505
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:25,588
It is open now.

1506
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:27,019
Good.

1507
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,424
Look,buddy,you don't have to sell
me on the product,I'm already in.

1508
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:51,525
Here's what I'm asking.

1509
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:56,050
Do you have a discount policy if you're
related to one of the girls that's gone wild?

1510
01:22:38,735 --> 01:22:41,768
Enjoy it,Kate. This is your baby.

1511
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,744
I'm going to go hide this shell
somewhere in the store.

1512
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:53,700
Hey.

1513
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:59,196
Can I get an Orange You Glad I Didn't
Say Banana?

1514
01:23:05,423 --> 01:23:09,487
All right. Holbrook v. Ostrowiski.

1515
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:10,588
Present.

1516
01:23:10,668 --> 01:23:13,031
I take it this is a paternity case.

1517
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:15,774
Actually,it's a maternity case,Your Honor.

1518
01:23:15,874 --> 01:23:18,406
Katherine Holbrook hired this
woman to be her surrogate,

1519
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:20,078
now we're not sure whose egg this is in here.

1520
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:21,950
What are you doing here?

1521
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,513
Angie needed some legal help,
so I'm helping.

1522
01:23:24,593 --> 01:23:26,425
-And you are?  -I'm Rob Ackerman,

1523
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:29,268
formerly with the firm Swanson and Weisberg.

1524
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,970
-Formerly?  - Yeah,now he makes

1525
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,531
fruit smoothies.

1526
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:35,444
You mean like Jamba Juice?

1527
01:23:37,156 --> 01:23:39,989
Yes,Your Honor,it's exactly like Jamba Juice.

1528
01:23:40,059 --> 01:23:42,392
'Cause I love Jamba Juice.

1529
01:23:42,732 --> 01:23:44,064
Yeah. Who doesn't?

1530
01:23:44,134 --> 01:23:45,966
You don't need a lawyer,

1531
01:23:46,076 --> 01:23:47,767
you know,we're just here to read some results.

1532
01:23:47,848 --> 01:23:50,841
But I know that I have the right to a lawyer.

1533
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,272
Objection.

1534
01:23:52,352 --> 01:23:53,443
And you are?

1535
01:23:53,523 --> 01:23:55,325
Carl Loomis,Your Highness.

1536
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,868
I'm here to seek joint custody of that fetus.

1537
01:23:57,928 --> 01:23:59,920
Your Honor,this dummy used to be my husband.

1538
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,134
Did you provide a DNA sample,Mr. Loomis?

1539
01:24:03,404 --> 01:24:04,395
Uh-huh.

1540
01:24:05,016 --> 01:24:06,807
What's that now?

1541
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:10,992
Did you give someone a hair follicle
or a vial of your blood?

1542
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:14,365
No. Not as it pertains to this case.

1543
01:24:14,436 --> 01:24:16,027
All right,then you're going to have
to take a seat.

1544
01:24:16,097 --> 01:24:17,439
And if you disrupt the proceedings again,

1545
01:24:17,509 --> 01:24:20,031
I'll ask the bailiff to escort you out.

1546
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:21,513
Not scared of her.

1547
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:22,744
May I have the lab results,please?

1548
01:24:22,814 --> 01:24:25,247
Okay,I would like to testify on
behalf of the prosecution.

1549
01:24:25,317 --> 01:24:27,149
There is no prosecution.

1550
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,350
Aye,aye,sir.

1551
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,521
If you insist,

1552
01:24:29,632 --> 01:24:31,694
you can make a statement and have
it entered on the record.

1553
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:33,796
- No,no,that's not necessary.
- No,I insist.

1554
01:24:33,876 --> 01:24:36,138
I would like to say something.

1555
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:38,911
I'm sorry.

1556
01:24:39,752 --> 01:24:42,345
I never should have listened to Carl.

1557
01:24:42,485 --> 01:24:45,518
I should have done the right thing. I just...

1558
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:48,662
This whole thing made you feel so happy.

1559
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:51,134
And it made me feel so important.

1560
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:55,739
I should have told you the truth.
And I'm sorry I didn't.

1561
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,482
I was just scared.

1562
01:25:00,094 --> 01:25:02,086
I also want to thank you.

1563
01:25:03,597 --> 01:25:06,871
I didn't like it sometimes,
but you made me grow up.

1564
01:25:07,912 --> 01:25:10,905
I know I was supposed to help
you have a baby.

1565
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:14,078
But you ended up teaching me how
to be a mother.

1566
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,693
So thank you. And I'm sorry.

1567
01:25:20,335 --> 01:25:22,307
She'd be a great mom,Your Honor.

1568
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,568
Kid wouldn't get away with shit.

1569
01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:25,470
Let's watch the language,please.

1570
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,513
Freedom of speech,look it up,
it's in the thing...

1571
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:30,145
What Ms. Ostrowiski is trying to say,
Your Honor,

1572
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:32,518
is that what she did was wrong.

1573
01:25:32,588 --> 01:25:34,420
It was extremely wrong.

1574
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,521
Cool it,you're my lawyer.

1575
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:37,933
And one of these lies,that's so
easy to spin out of control.

1576
01:25:38,004 --> 01:25:41,067
This guy,Carl Loomis,he lied to Angie.

1577
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:44,480
And then Angie lied to Kate,and
Kate lied to me,

1578
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,654
and it was a mistake. I mean,it was a...

1579
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:51,258
It's a mess,this is all a...
It's a mess. This is a real mess.

1580
01:25:51,328 --> 01:25:53,270
That's the worst closing argument
I've ever heard.

1581
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:56,533
Yeah,I know. I know. I'm a little rusty.

1582
01:25:56,603 --> 01:26:03,080
Kate. I just never wanted to come
back into a courtroom ever again.

1583
01:26:05,523 --> 01:26:07,254
And I came here for you.

1584
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:09,166
Thank you.

1585
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:11,499
I rest my case.

1586
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,444
You Honor,I think we are more than
ready for you to read the results.

1587
01:26:18,686 --> 01:26:23,682
Let the record show that the DNA test
indicates that Ms. Holbrook

1588
01:26:25,033 --> 01:26:27,466
is not the mother of this child.

1589
01:26:55,065 --> 01:26:56,116
Okay to get home?

1590
01:26:56,196 --> 01:26:57,627
Of course. Yeah.

1591
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,674
I remember the day I found out
I was going to have a kid.

1592
01:27:04,315 --> 01:27:07,218
Wow. I'll never take it for granted again.

1593
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,422
Well,I'd still like to meet that kid some time.

1594
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:13,624
I'll give you a call. You come by the store.

1595
01:27:14,465 --> 01:27:16,938
Okay,I'll definitely come by.

1596
01:27:17,508 --> 01:27:18,940
Okay.

1597
01:27:19,511 --> 01:27:21,102
I'm sorry,Kate.

1598
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:22,614
It's okay.

1599
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:25,156
I just threw up.

1600
01:27:33,776 --> 01:27:36,338
You look nice in a suit,by the way.

1601
01:28:04,538 --> 01:28:06,971
Angie.

1602
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:08,602
Hey.

1603
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:12,717
So,I guess I'll see you later?

1604
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:15,279
Probably not,actually.

1605
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,521
Right.

1606
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:20,425
I've been off Dr.Pepper for two weeks.

1607
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:22,797
This is water.

1608
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:24,639
Good for you.

1609
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:25,840
Thanks.

1610
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,816
Angie,I think your water broke.

1611
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:31,947
Wait,what?

1612
01:28:32,027 --> 01:28:33,358
Your water is breaking.

1613
01:28:33,428 --> 01:28:34,990
I got to get a bus to take me to the hospital.

1614
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:35,961
Let me drive you,I'll drive you.

1615
01:28:36,031 --> 01:28:37,333
Okay,hold this.

1616
01:28:37,403 --> 01:28:39,164
- I'm not due for three weeks.
- I know.

1617
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:40,236
Should we clean that up?

1618
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:42,078
No,somebody else will get that.

1619
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:52,969
This is really happening,isn't it?

1620
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:54,831
This is really happening.

1621
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:57,374
It's so weird,'cause I feel totally calm.

1622
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:00,717
- Come on,it feels like I'm shitting a knife.
- Okay.

1623
01:29:00,787 --> 01:29:02,149
Why won't you bitches help me?

1624
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:03,250
Just breathe.

1625
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,721
Okay,I'll take it from here.

1626
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:05,923
I want to go with her.

1627
01:29:05,993 --> 01:29:07,154
Are you family?

1628
01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:08,255
She's my sister.

1629
01:29:08,335 --> 01:29:09,597
Well,okay.

1630
01:29:09,667 --> 01:29:10,998
Oh,God,holy...

1631
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,212
This way. Sorry,sorry.

1632
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:17,285
- Give me some drugs. Give me this.
- You don't need drugs.

1633
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:18,786
- I want those drugs.
- No.

1634
01:29:18,856 --> 01:29:20,488
You'll never get me,pig!

1635
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,591
Get out of my way!

1636
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:24,863
Oh,God!

1637
01:29:24,933 --> 01:29:26,524
Angie!

1638
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,441
Is that guy dead? Is he dead?

1639
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:34,753
We need some olive oil to rub on my taint.

1640
01:29:34,823 --> 01:29:37,156
It's too late. It's too late.

1641
01:29:37,656 --> 01:29:39,328
Okay,this is gonna go great.

1642
01:29:39,398 --> 01:29:40,489
Yeah.

1643
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:42,691
Kate.

1644
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:45,074
It's twins.

1645
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:48,938
Gross.

1646
01:29:49,318 --> 01:29:50,550
I don't know what you're crying about.

1647
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,422
I gotta walk out of here alone.

1648
01:29:52,492 --> 01:29:54,964
That's a good joke,Dr. Manheim.

1649
01:29:55,935 --> 01:29:57,127
Okay.

1650
01:29:57,197 --> 01:29:58,638
Okay,and give me a big one.

1651
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:02,372
Big one! Whoa!

1652
01:30:02,943 --> 01:30:05,245
Nothing. Okay. All right,ready?

1653
01:30:05,315 --> 01:30:07,257
Kate,I'm so glad you're here.

1654
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:09,149
You don't look good,by the way.

1655
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:10,781
I feel a little dizzy.

1656
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:12,623
- Okay.  - Okay,and give me a big one.

1657
01:30:12,703 --> 01:30:15,766
Big one. Whoa.

1658
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:22,103
Good morning.

1659
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:28,890
- Hi.  - How are you feeling?

1660
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,703
Embarrassed. I fainted in the delivery room.

1661
01:30:31,773 --> 01:30:33,635
Well,Oscar's bringing you a change of clothes,

1662
01:30:33,705 --> 01:30:35,907
and Mom is here,in case you die.

1663
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:37,179
Great.

1664
01:30:37,249 --> 01:30:40,022
And somebody else wants to say hi. Hey.

1665
01:30:42,524 --> 01:30:44,186
It's embarrassing.

1666
01:30:47,299 --> 01:30:49,432
I'm scared your friend,Angie,
has me on speed dial.

1667
01:30:49,512 --> 01:30:51,974
She called me,like,10 times to
get down here and take care of you.

1668
01:30:52,044 --> 01:30:53,346
- Me,too.
- How is she?

1669
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:54,577
How is the baby?

1670
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:57,250
Great,she's just... She's beautiful.

1671
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,351
It's a girl.

1672
01:30:58,431 --> 01:30:59,592
Got a smile...

1673
01:30:59,662 --> 01:31:01,064
- Good morning.  - Hello.

1674
01:31:01,134 --> 01:31:02,155
Hi.

1675
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:04,297
Hi,there. Hi.

1676
01:31:04,508 --> 01:31:05,999
Could I have a moment alone with Kate,please?

1677
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:08,672
Sure. I'm going to go check on Mom.

1678
01:31:10,654 --> 01:31:12,316
Hi. How can I help you?

1679
01:31:12,386 --> 01:31:15,559
Hi. Well,we got your blood work back.

1680
01:31:15,629 --> 01:31:18,763
You are slightly anemic,which
explains the fainting.

1681
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:19,994
But there's something else you need to know.

1682
01:31:20,104 --> 01:31:21,505
You're pregnant.

1683
01:31:22,847 --> 01:31:24,178
That's impossible.

1684
01:31:24,248 --> 01:31:26,771
I paid a man thousands of dollars
to tell me that that's impossible.

1685
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:30,725
Well,you're only about eight weeks
along,but you are definitely pregnant.

1686
01:31:30,895 --> 01:31:32,988
He said the chances were one in a million.

1687
01:31:33,128 --> 01:31:36,191
Well,I'd start buying lottery
tickets,if I were you.

1688
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:38,573
Wait a minute.

1689
01:31:38,644 --> 01:31:39,735
Congrats.

1690
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,750
Rob.

1691
01:31:48,134 --> 01:31:49,895
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

1692
01:31:49,965 --> 01:31:52,839
I'm pregnant.

1693
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,571
You okay?

1694
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:56,803
Oh,my God.

1695
01:31:59,455 --> 01:32:01,748
Hi. Can I see her?

1696
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,363
She's gorgeous. What's her name?

1697
01:32:06,503 --> 01:32:08,435
This is Stef.

1698
01:32:08,505 --> 01:32:10,978
Stephanie,that's beautiful.

1699
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:13,771
No,Stefani. Like Gwen Stefani.

1700
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:17,084
Even better. Hello.

1701
01:32:17,855 --> 01:32:19,587
Are you waking up?

1702
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:21,819
So,you're pregnant.

1703
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:23,291
How'd you know that?

1704
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,633
I can read people's energies.

1705
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,476
Plus,your sister told me.

1706
01:32:34,022 --> 01:32:37,626
"Happy birthday to you

1707
01:32:38,366 --> 01:32:44,603
Happy birthday,dear Stefani

1708
01:32:44,883 --> 01:32:49,348
Happy birthday to you"

1709
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,201
Hey,Angie.

1710
01:33:02,812 --> 01:33:04,284
Are you two still together?

1711
01:33:04,354 --> 01:33:06,186
No,we're not together.

1712
01:33:06,486 --> 01:33:10,160
He's just trying to be a better
father,take some parenting classes.

1713
01:33:14,174 --> 01:33:15,696
He just started.

1714
01:33:18,008 --> 01:33:19,039
I see you.

01:33:24,655 --> 01:33:28,760
You think you're funny,punk?
What'd I tell you about hiding from me?

1716
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:33,605
Quit hiding from me. You think you're funny?

1717
01:33:34,746 --> 01:33:36,237
Hello.

This is a gasoline-powered mini-Ninja
motorcycle.

Oh,my God,Carl.

01:33:51,854 --> 01:33:53,876
You bought a motorcycle for a one-year-old?

01:33:56,028 --> 01:33:58,521
That's exactly what she wanted! Yay!

1723
01:33:58,601 --> 01:33:59,962
That's great.

Kate,let me give your baby my mojo.

1725
01:34:20,374 --> 01:34:23,367
Well,time is love. Got to run.

1726
01:34:25,489 --> 01:34:26,470
Whoa!

1727
01:34:49,204 --> 01:34:51,997
