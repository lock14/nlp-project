1
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:32,975
<i>Vicky and Cristina decided
to spend the summer in Barcelona.</i>

2
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:36,015
<i>Vicky was completing her master's
in Catalan Identity,</i>

3
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:37,645
<i>which she had become interested in</i>

4
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,565
<i>through her great affection
for the architecture of Gaudí.</i>

5
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:43,775
<i>Cristina, who spent the last six months</i>

6
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,535
<i>writing, directing, and acting in
a 12-minute film which she then hated,</i>

7
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,745
<i>had just broken up
with yet another boyfriend</i>

8
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,745
<i>and longed for a change of scenery.</i>

9
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,165
<i>Everything fell into place</i>

10
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,035
<i>when a distant relative of Vicky's family
who lived in Barcelona</i>

11
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,916
<i>offered to put both girls up
for July and August.</i>

12
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:01,966
<i>The two best friends
had been close since college</i>

13
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,716
<i>and shared the same tastes
and opinions on most matters,</i>

14
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,756
<i>yet when it came to the subject of love,</i>

15
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:10,056
<i>it would be hard to find
two more dissimilar viewpoints.</i>

16
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:13,516
<i>Vicky had no tolerance for pain
and no lust for combat.</i>

17
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,056
<i>She was grounded and realistic.</i>

18
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:19,146
<i>Her requirements in a man
were seriousness and stability.</i>

19
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:23,196
<i>She had become engaged to Doug
because he was decent and successful</i>

20
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,526
<i>and understood
the beauty of commitment.</i>

21
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:28,576
Yeah, I miss you, too.

22
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,286
<i>Cristina, on the other hand,</i>

23
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,116
<i>expected something
very different out of love.</i>

24
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:37,336
<i>She had reluctantly accepted suffering
as an inevitable component of deep passion,</i>

25
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,006
<i>and was resigned to putting
her feelings at risk.</i>

26
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,426
<i>If you asked her what it was
she was gambling her emotions on to win,</i>

27
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,176
<i>she would not have been able to say.</i>

28
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,136
<i>She knew what she didn't want, however,</i>

29
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,346
<i>and that was exactly
what Vicky valued above all else.</i>

30
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:56,307
Hello?

31
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,647
Oh, hello.

32
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,187
- Hi.
- Hi!

33
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,317
- You're Vicky.
- Yes, yes.

34
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:02,817
You're so grown up!

35
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:06,317
- Well, it's been a while.
- Hola, welcome to Barcelona.

36
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,777
- Hi. Cristina.
- Oh, Cristina, I'm Judy.

37
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,157
- This is your room.
- Oh, perfect!

38
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,367
- I put you together.
- This is gorgeous.

39
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:16,327
Judy, thank you so much
for having me here, because I know...

40
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:19,377
you know, it's so last-minute
and you don't know me at all.

41
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,877
To include me is just so sweet of you.

42
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:25,467
It's so nice to have
a little action around here.

43
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:28,427
It's been so quiet
since Arthur went off to college.

44
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:29,887
<i>After the girls unpacked</i>

45
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,557
<i>and Judy's husband Mark
got home from the golf course,</i>

46
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,307
<i>lunch was served on the terrace.</i>

47
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:36,557
- ...beautiful home.
- We've come to love it.

48
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:39,437
He makes friends with anybody
and he speaks the language,

49
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,107
so he was like, "Whee!"

50
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,777
You learned just fine.

51
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:44,567
So, what do you do, Cristina?

52
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:47,738
I am currently at liberty.

53
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,528
Oh, come on.
She... she made a film.

54
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:52,078
- How exciting!
- Yes, 12 minutes.

55
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:53,498
What was it about?

56
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:59,498
About? It was about
why love is so hard to define.

57
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:02,878
Wow, that's a mighty big subject
to handle in 12 minutes.

58
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:07,298
Vicky, you're getting
your master's in something.

59
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:09,838
Yeah, my master's in Catalan Identity.

60
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,718
Ah, well...

61
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,518
What do you plan on doing with that?

62
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,478
Oh, God, I don't know.
Maybe teaching, maybe curating.

63
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,938
Well, you don't have
to do something, you know.

64
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,568
But she's marrying
this wonderful man in the fall,

65
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:26,358
and all of her conflicts will be resolved
when he makes her pregnant.

66
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,238
Well, now that Judy's
decided your future...

67
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,998
To, uh, your summer in Barcelona.

68
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:36,368
- Welcome.
- Salud.

69
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,498
<i>- Cheers.
- Salud.</i>

70
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,589
<i>In the days that followed,</i>

71
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,089
<i>Vicky and Cristina drank in
the artistic treasures of the city.</i>

72
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,429
<i>They particularly enjoyed
the works of Gaudí and Miró.</i>

73
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,269
<i>Once, Mark and Judy
invited Vicky and Cristina</i>

74
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,899
<i>to go sailing with them
on Mark's boat.</i>

75
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,319
<i>With Cristina in mind,</i>

76
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,779
<i>Mark and Judy asked along
the son of one of his business partners,</i>

77
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,279
<i>an eligible young man
Mark thought she might like.</i>

78
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:17,369
My dream is to accumulate enough wealth
and sail off to an island somewhere

79
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,579
and spend the rest
of my days snorkeling.

80
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,499
I'm actually a snorkeling nut.

81
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,419
Have you ever snorkeled before?

82
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,969
<i>Unfortunately, Charles and Cristina
were not a match made in heaven.</i>

83
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:34,139
<i>Vicky, meanwhile, researched
every aspect of Catalan life,</i>

84
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:36,810
<i>even getting a tour of the market
and a local restaurant</i>

85
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,060
<i>to delve into Catalan cooking.</i>

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,980
<i>On balmy summer nights,</i>

87
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,690
<i>the girls would sometimes
go to hear Spanish guitar music,</i>

88
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,150
<i>which never failed to move Vicky
in some magical way.</i>

89
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>One evening, Mark and Judy took them
to the opening of a friend's art gallery.</i>

90
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,460
<i>Many local artists
and a number of collectors attended.</i>

91
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,760
Do you like them?

92
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,930
I do.
Thank you so much for taking us.

93
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,930
You know, we buy from this gallery.

94
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,890
Mark has commissioned this artist
to do this series of pictures

95
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,430
for his office walls, so...

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,060
- I think they'll be beauti...
- Is that the artist over there?

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,400
- Where?
- In the red?

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,730
Uh, no. No, no, no.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,070
That's not... no.

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,241
Uh, Alfred is...

101
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:34,741
Oh, no, he's the gentleman
in the linen coat, right there.

102
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,161
- Oh.
- That's him.

103
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:39,661
Um... I don't know who that is.

104
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:44,121
Uh, Mark, who is that gentleman
in the red shirt over there?

105
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,501
- Who?
- The gentleman in the red shirt.

106
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,131
- Who is that?
- Oh. He's a painter.

107
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,261
Remember, Diego told us about him?

108
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:54,681
He had that fiery relationship
with that beautiful woman who was nuts?

109
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,931
- Oh, my God!
- With the violent fighting...

110
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:59,261
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
- He had the messy divorce.

111
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,471
- Oh, my God!
- It was in all the newspapers.

112
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:05,941
Oh, my God. Um, his name
is Juan Antonio Gonzalo,

113
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,771
and he had this hot divorce
and she tried to kill him.

114
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,401
- Or he tried to kill her.
- What?

115
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,111
It was this, like,
really big thing in the art world.

116
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:18,071
I can't remember the details,
but he, you know, he...

117
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:20,871
We don't move in those
bohemian circles, so I don't know.

118
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:31,422
<i>Vicky and Cristina left the art gallery
and decided to go for dinner.</i>

119
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,672
<i>They strolled past the church
in the wonderful summer night air</i>

120
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,302
<i>while people celebrated,</i>

121
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:39,222
<i>finally winding up around midnight
at a little restaurant.</i>

122
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:43,482
Well, it's just nice to be able
to not have to worry about

123
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,522
if some place is gonna stay open, or...

124
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:50,152
Yeah, but you... we probably should be
worrying about our, you know, dreams.

125
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,112
What are you... who are you looking at?

126
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:57,112
Isn't that the... isn't that the painter
we just saw at the gallery?

127
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:02,122
Oh, yeah, right. He's the...
the painter with the bad divorce...

128
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,412
Mark told us... I was half-listening.

129
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:05,962
He was looking over here.

130
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,212
Well, that's because
you keep provoking contact.

131
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,962
- I'm not provoking contact!
- You are.

132
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,342
You've been throwing
little looks at him all night.

133
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,132
I'm just drinking my wine.

134
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,722
Mm-hmm, yeah, of course you are.

135
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:20,553
You must be doing something,
because, uh, he's coming over.

136
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,693
American?

137
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,113
I'm Cristina,
and this is my friend Vicky.

138
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,163
What color are your eyes?

139
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,703
Uh... they're blue.

140
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,673
I'd like to invite you both
to come with me to Oviedo.

141
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:53,133
To come where?

142
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,763
To Oviedo.
For the weekend.

143
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,673
We leave in one hour.

144
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,683
What... where is Oviedo?

145
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,723
- A very short flight.
- By plane?

146
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,853
What's in Oviedo?

147
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:07,183
I go to see a sculpture
that is very inspiring to me.

148
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:09,443
Very beautiful sculpture.
You will love it.

149
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:15,194
Oh, right, you're asking us
to fly to Oviedo and back.

150
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,904
No, we'll spend the weekend.

151
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:21,614
I mean, I'll show you around the city
and we'll eat well,

152
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:25,124
we'll drink good wine,
we'll make love.

153
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:28,254
Yeah, well, who exactly
is going to "make love"?

154
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,334
Hopefully, the three of us.

155
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,044
- Oh, my God.
- I'll get your bill.

156
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,504
Jesus, this guy!
He doesn't beat around the bush.

157
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,844
Look, señor, maybe in a different life.

158
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:44,684
Why not? Life is short,
life is dull, life is full of pain,

159
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,024
and this is a chance
for something special.

160
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,484
Right, well, who exactly are you?

161
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:51,734
I am Juan Antonio.
And you are...

162
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,864
Vicky, and you are Cristina, right?

163
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,444
Or is it the other way around?

164
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,704
- Yeah, that's right.
- It could be the other way around,

165
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:02,074
because frankly it doesn't matter,

166
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,124
because either of us will do
to keep the bed warm.

167
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,664
You know, I get it.

168
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:08,204
Well, you are both
so lovely and beautiful.

169
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:11,755
Yeah, thank you,
but we do not fly off to make love

170
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,715
with whoever invites us
to charming little Spanish towns.

171
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:19,805
Does she always
analyze every inspiration

172
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,515
until its grain of charm is...

173
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:25,935
Uh...

174
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,685
squeezed out of it?

175
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,775
I guess I have to say that I'm...

176
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:36,405
My eyes are green, actually.

177
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,865
Oh, God, look...

178
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:42,495
I wouldn't call our reluctance
to leap at your sexual offer

179
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,115
being over-analytical.

180
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:48,035
If you would care to join us
for some recognized form

181
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,415
of social interaction,
like a drink, then we'd be fine,

182
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:56,295
but otherwise, I think you should try,
you know, offering to some other table.

183
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:58,385
What offended you about the offer?

184
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:03,725
Surely not that I find you both
beautiful and desirable?

185
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,136
Offended me? No.

186
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:09,396
It's very amusing...
galling, to be honest... but...

187
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,936
Is it my imagination,
or is it getting late?

188
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:15,566
- Shall we go?
- I would love to go to Oviedo.

189
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:17,026
What? Are you kidding?

190
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,866
- Can we discuss...
- I think it would be so much fun.

191
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,866
I think we should go.
I would love to go.

192
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,496
Cristina, can we discuss this
some other time, when...

193
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:26,616
You know, when I saw you
across the room at the art gallery,

194
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:30,666
I noticed you have, uh, beautiful lips.

195
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,206
Very full, very sensual.

196
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:34,506
Thank you.

197
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,756
Okay, okay, look.
If you want to go...

198
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:40,636
Well, I can't guarantee the lovemaking,
because I happen to be very moody.

199
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,726
Let's not negotiate like a contract.

200
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:48,016
I came over here with no subterfuge
and presented my best offer.

201
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:51,726
Now I hope you will discuss it
and give me the pleasure

202
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,476
to take you with me to Oviedo.

203
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,146
I have the good fortune
to borrow my friend's plane.

204
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:59,907
It is just big enough for the three of us,
and I am a very good pilot.

205
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,617
Oh, it sounds very safe.

206
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,077
Think it over.

207
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,457
I hope you're joking about going.

208
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,547
My God, this guy is so interesting.

209
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,417
Interesting?
What's so interesting?

210
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,257
He wants to get us both into bed.

211
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,087
You know, but he'll settle for either,
in this case you.

212
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,757
Vicky, I'm a big girl, okay?

213
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,517
If I want to sleep with him I will;
If not, I won't.

214
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,597
Cristina, he's a total stranger.

215
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,687
This is impulsive even for you.

216
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,437
And, if I heard right,
he was violent with his wife.

217
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:35,937
At least he's not one of those
factory-made zombies, you know?

218
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,197
I mean, this would be
a great way to get to know him.

219
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:39,447
No, it's not.

220
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:43,947
I'm not going to Oviedo
with this charmingly candid wife beater.

221
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:47,497
You find his aggressiveness
attractive, but I don't.

222
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:50,037
I mean, he's certainly not handsome.

223
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,787
Well, I think he's very handsome.
He's got a great look.

224
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:55,048
I mean, he's,
you know, he's really sexy.

225
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:58,338
Mm-hmm, well, you would,
because you're a neurotic.

226
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,378
You gotta admire
his no-bullshit approach.

227
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,508
What are you talking about?
It's all bullshit.

228
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:06,348
I'm not going to Oviedo.
First off, I never heard of Oviedo.

229
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:07,928
I don't find him winning.

230
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,808
Third, even if I wasn't engaged
and was free to have

231
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:14,728
some kind of dalliance with a Spaniard,
I wouldn't pick this one.

232
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:15,938
Hello?

233
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,318
Hi. Oh, hi.
I can't talk right now.

234
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:23,868
I'm trying to save Cristina
from making a potentially fatal mistake.

235
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:26,948
What? No, the usual.

236
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,788
Yeah, I'll call you back.

237
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,288
I love you, too.

238
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,168
If we go back to the house now,

239
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,918
we can just throw some things
in a bag and meet him there.

240
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,338
Look, I took
an instant liking to this guy.

241
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:40,678
I mean, he's not one
of these cookie-cutter molds.

242
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:43,388
He's creative and he's artistic and...

243
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:46,308
Cookie-cutter mold?
Is that what you think of Doug?

244
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:48,679
Doug? Who said anything about Doug?

245
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,899
It's ridiculous. You like the way it sounds,
to pick up and fly off in an airplane.

246
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:57,359
I know. I don't know why I'm so scared,
unless I'm scared of myself.

247
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,569
It's a mistake, Cristina.

248
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,869
They predicted a little storm
out of the town, out of Oviedo,

249
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,419
but it's nothing serious.

250
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:13,789
Don't you worry, really.

251
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,209
As you can see here...

252
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,669
Here it's just...
just a little bumpy, all right?

253
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,589
Would you like to fly it?

254
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,049
Oh, no thank you.

255
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,309
It's easy.
It's even easier than a car. Try it.

256
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,359
<i>By early morning,
they had reached their destination</i>

257
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:41,149
<i>and proceeded to a hotel
that Juan Antonio had selected for them.</i>

258
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:45,160
<i>Vicky made sure she and Cristina
had their own room...</i>

259
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,530
<i>and Juan Antonio had his.</i>

260
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,990
<i>If he was disappointed,
he hid it well.</i>

261
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,920
<i>After freshening up,
he took them to see the sculpture</i>

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,540
<i>that was so meaningful to him.</i>

263
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,960
- Are you very religious?
- No, no, I'm not.

264
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,760
The trick is to enjoy life,

265
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
accepting it has
no meaning whatsoever.

266
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,970
- Right.
- No meaning?

267
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,890
You don't think that authentic love
gives life meaning?

268
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,890
Yes, but love is so transient.

269
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,350
Isn't it?

270
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,690
I was in love with
a most incredible woman...

271
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,520
and then in the end...

272
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,530
Yes?

273
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,110
She put a knife into me.

274
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,120
My God, that's terrible.

275
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,530
Maybe you did something
to deserve it.

276
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,790
<i>Juan Antonio
took his guests for lunch.</i>

277
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,330
<i>They discussed art and romance.</i>

278
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,131
<i>He was full of stories
about Maria Elena, his ex-wife,</i>

279
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:43,011
<i>whom he both criticized and idolized.</i>

280
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,841
<i>He proved to be a good host,</i>

281
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,391
<i>and in the afternoon
he took them to see the local sights,</i>

282
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:51,391
<i>where they enjoyed hearing
about the city and took photos.</i>

283
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,531
<i>Later, they bought candy and cakes
at a charming sweet shop,</i>

284
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:06,071
<i>which were homemade and delicious.</i>

285
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,201
<i>They continued to document their trip,</i>

286
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,041
<i>and while Vicky remained skeptical,</i>

287
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,121
<i>Cristina had a wonderful time.</i>

288
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:27,171
<i>The question of sleeping together
did not come up until that night,</i>

289
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,341
<i>and Juan Antonio was a little drunk.</i>

290
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,101
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

291
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,432
All right.

292
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:39,732
Well, now that the day's almost over...

293
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:46,152
is it reasonable of me to ask you
if you'll both join me in my room?

294
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,072
Oh, come on, I thought we'd settled that.

295
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:51,242
Vicky's just trying to say that she's
engaged to be married, that's all.

296
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:53,412
Great. Then these are
her last days of freedom.

297
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:57,162
No. Look, I'm not free.
I'm committed.

298
00:16:57,252 --> 00:17:00,542
You know what my theory is...
and when I drink, I get brutally frank...

299
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:03,292
I think that you're still hurting

300
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:06,882
from the failure of your marriage
to Maria Elena,

301
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:10,512
and you're trying to lose yourself
in empty sex.

302
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,142
Empty sex?

303
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,932
Do you have such
a low opinion of yourself?

304
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:18,142
She's just saying that it has to have
meaning for her, that's all.

305
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:23,062
I mean, the city's romantic,
the night is warm and balmy,

306
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,612
we are alive...
isn't that meaning enough?

307
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:28,243
Hey, look, I just came along
to keep Cristina company.

308
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,073
I'm engaged to be married.

309
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:34,493
I have a handsome, lovely fiancé
who I make love with,

310
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,913
and also holds
a very real place in my heart,

311
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,123
and to be perfectly frank,
Juan Antonio,

312
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:42,463
if I were the type of person
that played around,

313
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,423
I don't think it's in the cards for us.

314
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:49,093
So, I'm tired,
I haven't slept in 24 hours,

315
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,683
and that is exactly
what I am going to do.

316
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:55,143
And you?

317
00:17:56,013 --> 00:18:00,773
I'll go to your room,
but... you have to seduce me.

318
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:06,403
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:11,953
I am just here
to have a quick drink...

320
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,613
to say thank you,

321
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,873
and then I'm going to go
back to my room.

322
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:18,793
All right.

323
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:21,413
Did you act
in the small film you made?

324
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,794
Did I act?
Yeah, I acted. Why?

325
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,924
I hope you were
more convincing than you are

326
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,594
when you pretend to have come here
for one quick drink.

327
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:34,434
I am here to go to bed with you.
You're right, um...

328
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:40,774
So you're pretty much home free,
unless you... blow it.

329
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,234
- Blow it?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:45,694
"Blow it."
You mean ruin the moment?

331
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:46,984
Yeah.

332
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,904
Oh. And how would I do that?

333
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:51,614
Um, I don't know.

334
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:55,914
It could be anything
from some inane comment

335
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:59,034
to wearing the wrong kind of shorts.

336
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,504
Although...
somehow by looking at you,

337
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:05,334
I think you're wearing
the right kind of shorts.

338
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,134
You're very hard to please.

339
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:11,924
Yeah, well. I am famous
for my intolerance.

340
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:13,014
Here.

341
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:20,435
What do you want in life
besides a man with the right shorts?

342
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:22,605
Mmm...

343
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,195
I don't know.

344
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:31,535
I know I'm not gonna settle
till I find what I'm looking for.

345
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,655
Mm, which is what?

346
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,245
Um.

347
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,335
Something... else.

348
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,085
I want something different,
something more...

349
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:49,845
some sort of counterintuitive love.

350
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:53,465
Meaning?

351
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:56,635
Meaning...

352
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:00,395
I don't know.

353
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,475
I don't know what I want.

354
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,395
I only know what I don't want.

355
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:09,905
If you don't start undressing me soon,
this is gonna turn into a panel discussion.

356
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,626
What? Are you okay?

357
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:31,346
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's something I ate.

358
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,136
What's wrong?
Can I get you anything?

359
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,636
Um, no, I...

360
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,886
- I shouldn't be drinking.
- What happened?

361
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,146
I'm going to be sick.

362
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:46,776
It's her ulcer, and perhaps
a little food poisoning, maybe both.

363
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:47,896
Oh, my God, both?

364
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:49,446
She must just "ret, " not eat.

365
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:52,026
- Okay, rest?
- Yeah, rest. Rest.

366
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:55,946
<i>With Cristina stuck in bed,
Vicky was anxious to get back to Barcelona</i>

367
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,496
<i>and in no mood to sightsee.</i>

368
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:58,746
Uh-huh, oh, okay.

369
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:02,956
Well, when he gets out of his meeting,
can you get him to call me on my cell?

370
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,046
Yeah, I'm still stuck in Oviedo.

371
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:08,877
<i>But sightsee is what they did.</i>

372
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,837
I feel very sorry about Cristina.

373
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,137
Oh, come on.

374
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:14,507
Don't pretend concern.

375
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:18,057
I'm sure that you kept
encouraging her to drink,

376
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:20,387
as you did to both of us
throughout dinner.

377
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:22,687
But I can hold my liquor.

378
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,687
She never mentioned her ulcer.

379
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:29,187
No, no, because
she's a mental adolescent,

380
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:33,277
and being romantic,
she has a death wish.

381
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,867
So, for a brief moment of passion,

382
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:40,207
she completely abandons
all responsibilities.

383
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,957
<i>After lunch, Juan Antonio took Vicky
to see the old lighthouse at Avilés,</i>

384
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,917
<i>which she found very beautiful.</i>

385
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:52,127
Uh, I was born near here, and...

386
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:56,847
it would be a sin if I came out here
without paying a visit to my father.

387
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,307
Will be that boring to you?

388
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:00,347
Bor... no.

389
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:02,308
No, I think that... that would be

390
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:05,688
the first genuinely interesting
proposition you've made me.

391
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:09,398
I would love to see
your father and his house.

392
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,548
Buenos días.

393
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,208
- My father, Julio.
- Julio.

394
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,548
<i>Buenos días.
Qué casa tan bonita.</i>

395
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,428
Oh. You know, if we carry on,
I don't think it's gonna...

396
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:38,888
It's fine. That was great.

397
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,218
He speaks no English.

398
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,228
I'm sure my Spanish is going to go.

399
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,318
He refuses to speak
any other language,

400
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,528
and that's an important point
with my father, actually.

401
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:52,608
Really, it is? Why?

402
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:54,408
Because he's a poet,

403
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:58,029
and he writes the most beautiful sentences
in the Spanish language,

404
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,989
but he, I don't know,
he doesn't believe

405
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,039
that a poet should pollute
his words by any other tongue.

406
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,749
- Which is quite a...
- No. No, it makes sense.

407
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,919
I understand, 'cause of the translation
and the things you might lose.

408
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,839
I mean, I took some Spanish.

409
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,049
I... of course,
I have no flair for languages.

410
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,259
- I read it much better than I speak it.
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,099
Maybe I could read your father?

412
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,519
No, but he doesn't publish.
That's the point.

413
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,059
Why not?

414
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,019
Be... I'll explain later.

415
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,479
You want some coñac?

416
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,189
Yes, thank you, just a very...
very, very little bit.

417
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,449
Eh, Maria Elena, Maria Elena...

418
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,730
This was my favorite place
to come and read when I was young.

419
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,070
Yes, I wanted to be a writer,
not a painter.

420
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,820
Painting came later.

421
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,320
And I wanted to play music, too.

422
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
I mean, all I knew is that I was full of,

423
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,240
I don't know, real emotion,
and I had to find a way to express it.

424
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,250
Cristina says the same thing.

425
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,830
Cristina's a very interesting girl.
Want to sit?

426
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah.

427
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,880
So, uh, tell me, why won't
your father publish his poems?

428
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,010
Well, because he hates the world,

429
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,390
and that's his way
of getting back at them,

430
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,311
to create beautiful works and then...

431
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,311
to deny them to the public,
which I think it's...

432
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:52,441
My God.

433
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:57,031
Well, what makes him so angry
toward the human race?

434
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:00,821
Because after thousands
of years of civilization,

435
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:03,331
they still haven't learned to love.

436
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,871
<i>They returned to the hotel.</i>

437
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,751
<i>Cristina was feeling better,
but far too shaky,</i>

438
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,631
<i>and needed more rest.</i>

439
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,751
<i>Vicky and Juan Antonio dined
together at lovely little restaurant.</i>

440
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:19,471
<i>She was more relaxed than at lunch,
and had just finished a great deal of wine.</i>

441
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,801
<i>This time, she was enjoying
the conversation.</i>

442
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,561
...no place on earth.

443
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:27,471
My father used to bring me here.

444
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:33,811
Hello?

445
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,781
Hey. Did I get you
at a bad time, babe?

446
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,401
Oh, hi, no.
I'm just about to eat.

447
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:41,282
Can I, uh, call you back?

448
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:42,572
Let me just say one thing.

449
00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:44,782
Paul and Maryanne said they found
a house up where they are

450
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:47,542
that they liked even better
than the one in Bedford Hills.

451
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:51,332
Oh, yeah?
Y-y-you're breaking up a little.

452
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:56,422
Babe? Call me later, but this house
has a pool and a tennis court.

453
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:59,632
Okay? We could both take lessons
from Paul's instructor.

454
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:03,552
Okay, I'll call you back.
I can't hear you.

455
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,012
I love you.

456
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:08,022
Uh... Oh, God.

457
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,852
Connection's terrible.

458
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:16,152
- Oh, thank you.
- Here.

459
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:18,612
What is this wine?

460
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:20,322
- It's delicious.
- It's great.

461
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:24,162
Was that your fiancé?

462
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,992
Uh, yes, yes.

463
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:29,752
Why were you so nervous,
speaking to him?

464
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:31,622
What, was I nervous?

465
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:33,872
Yes. You turned red.

466
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,463
Well...

467
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:37,713
Well, I'm sure it's the wine.

468
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:40,553
Would he be upset if he knew
we were dining together?

469
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,383
No, not at all.
Are you kidding?

470
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:47,933
I mean, I don't think he'd love
the basic concept of me

471
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:51,483
sitting with a man,
drinking wine over candlelight,

472
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:55,063
but he'd quickly realize
there'd be nothing to worry about, so...

473
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:59,783
Would you ever withhold your work
from the public out of rage?

474
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:01,943
No, no, no, not like my father.

475
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,613
Oh no, I told you...

476
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,453
I affirm life despite everything.

477
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:09,203
Right, right.

478
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:14,413
Well... I'd be curious
to see your work.

479
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:16,463
Really?

480
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:21,303
Why? I mean,
you are so disapproving of me.

481
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,673
Well, I've gotten to know you better,

482
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:27,053
and, you know, it'd be interesting,

483
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:30,354
and, after all, you are a Catalan painter,
and that's my subject.

484
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,814
What gave you such an interest
in Catalan culture?

485
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:38,564
Well, uh... I, uh, fell in love
with Gaudí's church when I was 14,

486
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,484
and one thing led to another.

487
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:46,824
Hmm. And, uh, you also admire
Spanish guitar, I hear?

488
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:49,834
Yes, yes. I love the guitar.

489
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:53,834
Would you like to go to hear
some wonderful guitar tonight?

490
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:55,374
- Tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

491
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,334
Well, it's a little late,

492
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:02,884
and, you know,
I'm a little wobbly from the wine.

493
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:06,224
You said you could hold your alcohol.

494
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,804
Besides, we leave tomorrow.

495
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:12,724
Okay, sure.

496
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:13,974
Great.

497
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,375
That was, uh...
that was unbelievable.

498
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:15,795
Thank you. Thank you.

499
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,296
I was looking at your face,
and you looked very moved.

500
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:20,376
Yes, yes.

501
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,466
A few times I saw a look like that.

502
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:25,216
Right, and on Maria Elena, I'm sure.

503
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,096
Well, yes, maybe on Maria Elena,

504
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:31,306
when she saw or heard
something that moved her, yes.

505
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,226
You...

506
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:35,226
You're still in love with her.

507
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,936
No, I'm not. I'm not.

508
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:41,236
Mmm, that confirms it.

509
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,866
No, she will always
be a part of me,

510
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:46,696
and she's
an important person in my life,

511
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:51,366
but for the two of us,
something was not working.

512
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,326
What element?

513
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,246
We never found out.

514
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:06,926
You said you were looking at my face.

515
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:09,216
Why?

516
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,346
Why were you looking at mine?

517
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,686
Was I?

518
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:14,807
You probably saw my tears.

519
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:15,937
Yes.

520
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,277
Yeah, um...

521
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:20,317
I'm a little out of control.

522
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:23,987
I was looking at your face
because I find it very beautiful.

523
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:25,407
You do?

524
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,947
Of course I do.

525
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:30,617
Of course I do,
and you know I do.

526
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,397
<i>On the trip home, Vicky,</i>

527
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,617
<i>who had mentioned nothing
to Cristina, was silent.</i>

528
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:09,778
<i>Cristina, on the other hand,
talked nervously.</i>

529
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,908
I must apologize to both of you
for ruining the whole weekend!

530
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,168
I'm completely mortified.
I'm humiliated.

531
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,088
I don't know whether it was the wine...
it could've been the shellfish.

532
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,168
Because, you know,
I have this ulcer,

533
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:26,468
and I just thank God you knew
enough sights to keep Vicky occupied.

534
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:30,428
You know, I had these horrible nightmares
that you two would be like oil and water,

535
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:32,768
hating every minute
of being together.

536
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,848
I just couldn't move.

537
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,898
<i>Vicky buried herself in work
at the library.</i>

538
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:43,898
<i>She put foolish ideas out of her head
and concentrated on her thesis,</i>

539
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:47,158
<i>but she found her thoughts
frequently returning to Oviedo.</i>

540
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,368
<i>Cristina, searching for
a means of self-expression,</i>

541
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:54,538
<i>wandered the streets
of Barcelona,</i>

542
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:57,578
<i>experimented with
her latest passion, photography,</i>

543
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,998
<i>and believed that she
had made a fool of herself</i>

544
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,458
<i>exactly at the moment of truth
with Juan Antonio.</i>

545
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,509
<i>And then, 48 hours later,</i>

546
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,629
<i>Cristina came to Vicky
with an announcement.</i>

547
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,219
Vicky, he called.

548
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,139
Hmm, what? Who?

549
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,889
Juan Antonio.
He called me just now.

550
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,979
Juan Antonio called you?

551
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,019
Yeah. He wants to see me,
take me to some vineyard,

552
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,649
some wine tasting or something.

553
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:21,899
I said absolutely.

554
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:23,779
A wine tasting?

555
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,859
But... what about your ulcer?

556
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:29,739
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
A little wine's not going to hurt me.

557
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,489
The point is that he wants to see me.

558
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:32,909
Isn't that great?

559
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:34,659
- Yeah, yeah.
- I can't believe it!

560
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,409
I never thought he was gonna call.

561
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,329
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

562
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,169
<i>That night, the two women
had trouble falling asleep.</i>

563
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,919
<i>Cristina sat in the kitchen
drinking coffee</i>

564
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,969
<i>and working on her poetry.</i>

565
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,599
<i>Vicky, too, was lost
in memories of a night</i>

566
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,390
<i>that now seemed
more and more unreal.</i>

567
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,160
Hello?

568
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,990
Hey, babe.
Did I wake you?

569
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,160
No. No, no, no.

570
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,790
I was just going to sleep.

571
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,580
I'm sorry I called so late.

572
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,670
I had to get out of the office,
get some air and get some coffee,

573
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,460
and I had this great idea.

574
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,050
Check this out.

575
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,800
Dad has contacts
in the American embassy in Spain, right?

576
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,600
I thought I could come early,
work from there on my computer,

577
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,930
and the two of us
could get married in Barcelona.

578
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,560
You said it was a romantic spot.

579
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,730
You know, we'll just do
a quick city hall-type thing.

580
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,400
'Course we'll do it
all over again in New York.

581
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
We'll have a huge blowout
for our families and friends,

582
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,150
but I thought it'd be fun.
What do you think?

583
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,030
What... to get married here?

584
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Yeah, why not?

585
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,241
It'd be great to tell our kids
we married in Spain.

586
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,871
Dad's friends would make it
real easy for us.

587
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,911
Oh, I don't know what to say.

588
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,001
You don't sound bowled over.

589
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,671
No, it's, uh...

590
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,001
It's just a surprise.

591
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:09,711
So? Look, we're gonna marry
in the fall anyway,

592
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,671
and we're gonna
do that too, I promise.

593
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:13,551
Yeah, so what's the point?

594
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,891
The point is it's different,
it's exciting.

595
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,761
I told the idea to Ken and Alice.

596
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:21,811
They said they wished they'd done it... I
mean, you know, in London in their case...

597
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,401
but they were excited.

598
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:25,861
Well, I-I...

599
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:30,321
You sound a bit reluctant.

600
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,201
Me? No.

601
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,861
Why would I... why would I be?

602
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,871
No, I...

603
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,411
I think it's a fine idea.

604
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,871
I think it's great... it's a great idea.

605
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:46,581
Yeah. Yeah, no, I think
it's gonna be good.

606
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:48,842
Listen, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
I know I woke you up.

607
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,172
I'll give you more details tomorrow.
I love you so much.

608
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,592
<i>Juan Antonio took Cristina
to a wine tasting.</i>

609
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:32,382
<i>After, he took her back
to his house,</i>

610
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:35,512
<i>a lovely place he had purchased
from another painter years ago</i>

611
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,552
<i>and which served
as his home and his studio.</i>

612
00:35:38,642 --> 00:35:40,602
<i>He showed her his work,
which delighted her.</i>

613
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:43,933
<i>She loved the colors
and the wild, emotional way</i>

614
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:46,143
<i>he applied the paint
to the canvases.</i>

615
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:49,273
<i>From there, it was
only one floor up to his bedroom.</i>

616
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,733
<i>He told her of his marriage
to Maria Elena</i>

617
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:55,903
<i>and their deep love
and their terrible fights.</i>

618
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:58,663
<i>He told Cristina he had not wanted
to make love with anyone else</i>

619
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:01,083
<i>in the bedroom they shared till now.</i>

620
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:04,043
<i>This time, Cristina kept her food down.</i>

621
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:59,054
<i>Juan took Cristina out
several more times.</i>

622
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,264
<i>They went to see a new sculpture
by a friend of his.</i>

623
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,104
<i>He showed her some
of his favorite parts of the city,</i>

624
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,274
<i>where she took photographs.</i>

625
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,564
<i>Juan Antonio was friendly
with all the whores</i>

626
00:37:11,654 --> 00:37:13,824
<i>and thought they would make
wonderful subjects.</i>

627
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,624
<i>He encouraged Cristina's work,</i>

628
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:26,414
<i>although she was always
too shy to allow him to see it.</i>

629
00:37:28,294 --> 00:37:30,044
<i>He took her to lunch
with his friends,</i>

630
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,675
<i>who were poets and artists
and musicians.</i>

631
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:34,965
<i>Cristina held her own quite well.</i>

632
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,595
<i>Meanwhile, one day,
going to study yet again the Park Güell,</i>

633
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:42,975
<i>which Gaudí had designed</i>

634
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,515
<i>and which figured
quite prominently in her thesis,</i>

635
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:48,435
<i>Vicky had a chance encounter.</i>

636
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,525
- Vicky.
- Oh, hello.

637
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:57,655
- I mean, my goodness.
- How are you?

638
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,245
What are you doing here?

639
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:02,075
Nothing. Just doing some sketches.

640
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:03,995
Oh, right.

641
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,495
Well, I didn't mean to disturb you, so...

642
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,545
Disturb me, no.
How could you disturb me?

643
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,795
We never had a chance
to say a proper good-bye.

644
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:17,095
Oh, well, you could've called me.

645
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:20,555
I... yeah.

646
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:25,145
I debated it, but I didn't think
there was much point.

647
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:29,436
Yeah, but you never phoned,
not to say anything...

648
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:31,566
I mean, "Thank you, it was fun..."

649
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:35,196
I mean, you don't make love to someone
and then never call them

650
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:37,446
unless you were greatly disappointed.

651
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,406
Quite the opposite.

652
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:42,906
But... you have plans to marry,

653
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,866
and I thought it best
to stop anything

654
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,786
before it led to
a bad situation for everyone.

655
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:50,046
Yeah, well, I'm only saying
that we made love,

656
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,336
and you seemed to drop off
the face of the earth.

657
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:57,386
I mean, I realize these things
don't mean much to you...

658
00:38:57,466 --> 00:39:00,386
To pursue matters would have
only caused you anxiety,

659
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,766
and for me, a disappointment.

660
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:07,476
I had the ability to hurt you
after one night?

661
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:11,726
Maria Elena used to say that...

662
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:16,606
only unfulfilled love
can be romantic.

663
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,537
Right. Okay.

664
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:25,537
Well, the truth is,
you're much more suited to Cristina.

665
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,207
I've grown very fond of Cristina.

666
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:35,757
So, I'm very happy for you
and your husband-to-be.

667
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:40,507
And I... for you and Cristina.

668
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:42,517
Right.

669
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:44,847
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

670
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:50,147
<i>And so the morning came</i>

671
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:52,817
<i>when Vicky's husband-to-be
arrived from New York.</i>

672
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:05,457
<i>Juan Antonio, like certain creative men,
needed always to live with a woman,</i>

673
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,997
<i>and had invited Cristina
to move in with him, which she accepted.</i>

674
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:14,457
How much do I owe you?

675
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,228
- So you're with Global Enterprises?
- Yes!

676
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:33,688
Tom Sutter's an old friend of mine.

677
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,568
Oh, you know Tom Sutter!
We play golf.

678
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:36,648
- You do?
- Yeah.

679
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,448
I got some stories.
Tom has never beaten me.

680
00:40:38,528 --> 00:40:40,738
Oh, well, he's not
the greatest player in the world...

681
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,218
My God.

682
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,128
You're a whole different person here.

683
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:02,258
What does that mean?

684
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:04,808
You were so into it.

685
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:07,518
Well, am I not usually?

686
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,309
Yeah, no, of course you are...

687
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,769
I'm giving you a compliment.

688
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:17,939
Maybe it's the Barcelona air.

689
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,109
Come here, hold me.
Hold me.

690
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:26,539
- You okay?
- Yeah.

691
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:28,579
Yeah.

692
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,829
How's Cristina doing?

693
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,749
Oh, you know, she's already
moved in with some guy.

694
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,879
That was quick.
Don't tell me he's a bullfighter.

695
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:36,959
No...

696
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:38,629
Writer? Composer?

697
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,469
Tortured pseudo-intellectual
and self-destructive?

698
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,429
Yeah, I know, sometimes
she gets on my nerves

699
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,009
with her crackpot love affairs.

700
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:49,179
Look, I love her
because she's your friend,

701
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:50,849
but I often warn you about her.

702
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:52,599
She's an unhappy person.

703
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:55,689
She can't part with
that self-image she has

704
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:59,279
of the oh-so-special woman,
the artist trying to find herself.

705
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,609
I find her contempt
for normal values pretentious.

706
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,570
It's boring, cliché.

707
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,950
Yeah, well, men like her.

708
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,950
Well, she's pretty...

709
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,290
and not exactly difficult
to maneuver into the sack.

710
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,130
Now, you... on the other hand,

711
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,210
took a little effort to get to bed.

712
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,750
Hey.

713
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,420
But it was worth the struggle.

714
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,920
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

715
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,510
So, Juan Antonio wants to take me

716
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,140
to this old amusement park
that he said I would love,

717
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,020
and I thought
that we could just get lunch,

718
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,730
all of us, and then
we could all see it together.

719
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,610
What, tomorrow for lunch?

720
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,530
We can't. We have plans.

721
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,280
Oh, no, no, no. I'd...

722
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,610
No, we can always go boating
with Mark and Judy.

723
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,950
I'd like to go with Cristina
and Juan Antonio.

724
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,370
- I really want to go boating.
- Yeah, that would be great.

725
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,620
- Tomorrow. Okay.
- Okay.

726
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,250
<i>The two couples met for lunch,</i>

727
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,551
<i>and during the course of conversation,
an awkward moment occurred.</i>

728
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,801
<i>Juan Antonio, having
warm thoughts about Cristina,</i>

729
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,301
<i>tried to brush his foot
against hers under the table</i>

730
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:08,721
<i>and accidentally brushed Vicky's.</i>

731
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:19,111
<i>The amusement park was everything
Juan Antonio led them to believe.</i>

732
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:22,441
<i>It was antique and charming,
and overlooked all of Barcelona.</i>

733
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:47,011
I see why you love
your fiancé, 'cause he's very charming.

734
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,801
Yes, yes. He's lovely.

735
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:50,641
And very well suited to you.

736
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,352
I don't think I like
the way you say that.

737
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:58,232
No, I only mean that you make
a comfortable couple in the best sense.

738
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:01,482
Look, you don't understand.
I can't do anything about it now.

739
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,112
I'm not saying the thought
hasn't crossed my mind, but...

740
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,612
Vicky, please. Please, Vicky.

741
00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:08,912
We must not get into
this conversation again, all right?

742
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:12,372
Things have moved on, and I've
developed real feelings for Cristina.

743
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:14,702
Well, then, what did...

744
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:18,372
why did you rub your foot
against mine under the table?

745
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:21,792
- I didn't. I didn't.
- Yes, yes.

746
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:23,252
When I looked over at you.

747
00:44:23,342 --> 00:44:24,922
Oh, no, if I did, it was a mistake.

748
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,382
I mean, my intention
was to touch Cristina.

749
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:33,012
Oh, okay. I-l... I'm sorry.

750
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:34,602
I apologize for my mistake.

751
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:36,392
Sorry, it was my mistake,
but listen...

752
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:37,982
- No, I'm...
- Listen, listen.

753
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:41,772
You are all set to enter
a completely different life,

754
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,862
a life you always wanted
with a man you love.

755
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:45,232
Yes, goddamn it, I know!

756
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:49,033
And then I met you and we had this
ridiculously irrational weekend together

757
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:51,873
and now I... now I don't know
where I am.

758
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:54,413
Please. I'm with Cristina,

759
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:57,963
and you're going to get married
in two weeks, Vicky.

760
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,833
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay?

761
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:01,213
I know, you're right.

762
00:45:01,293 --> 00:45:03,423
Cristina loves you.

763
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:05,053
I would never...

764
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:08,053
Yes, yes, and Cristina and I
are a good fit.

765
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:09,973
I mean we...
she speaks my language.

766
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:11,223
You and I... I don't know.

767
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:13,393
We'd be at each other's throats
in a month.

768
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:15,933
- Right?
- Yeah.

769
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:20,353
Look, maybe our paths will cross again
someday under different circumstances.

770
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:22,353
I mean, who knows about life?

771
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:26,483
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, I'm an idiot.

772
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,533
I don't know what I expect to happen.

773
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:34,123
<i>And so the wedding day came
and Vicky married Doug.</i>

774
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:35,623
<i>Cristina was there.</i>

775
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:39,003
<i>She did not bring Juan Antonio,
who made an excuse.</i>

776
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:42,833
<i>Following the ceremony,
the bride and groom</i>

777
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:45,214
<i>left for a mini-honeymoon in Seville.</i>

778
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:55,184
<i>Meanwhile, Cristina began
to sense the possibility</i>

779
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:57,644
<i>of the kind of relationship
she had always sought,</i>

780
00:45:57,724 --> 00:45:59,774
<i>but in the past had eluded her.</i>

781
00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:04,984
<i>She was the lover of an exciting man,
an artist, whose work she believed in.</i>

782
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:09,074
<i>She was already thinking of herself
as a kind of expatriate,</i>

783
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:11,114
<i>not smothered
by what she believed to be...</i>

784
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:13,784
<i>America's puritanical
and materialistic culture,</i>

785
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,834
<i>which she had little patience for.</i>

786
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:19,834
<i>She saw herself
more a European soul,</i>

787
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,794
<i>in tune with the thinkers and artists</i>

788
00:46:21,874 --> 00:46:26,634
<i>she felt expressed her tragic,
romantic, freethinking view of life.</i>

789
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:41,105
<i>With Juan Antonio's circle of friends,</i>

790
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,195
<i>she hobnobbed
with creative people of all sorts.</i>

791
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:45,605
<i>She loved their company,</i>

792
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:49,075
<i>and continued to experiment
with writing and taking pictures.</i>

793
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,255
You had a good time?

794
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:09,885
Yeah, Seville is breathtaking.

795
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:11,305
We ran into some friends
from New York.

796
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,725
Had a chance to spend some time
with them, which was great.

797
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:14,885
A little too much time.

798
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:17,555
You're just angry because
they beat our brains out at bridge.

799
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:19,565
- Well, I don't like bridge.
- I don't, either.

800
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:21,225
- What is this?
- A little swag, here.

801
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,565
Attention, please.

802
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:25,065
Cristina and Juan Antonio
sent you this wedding gift.

803
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:27,655
When I found out that she
was seriously dating Juan Antonio,

804
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:28,985
I couldn't believe it. I...

805
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:31,405
Just what we need...
a Rorschach blot.

806
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:34,206
You know, I don't think I like it.

807
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:36,246
- We'll buy you one of Alejandro's.
- This you will.

808
00:47:57,556 --> 00:47:59,096
<i>Sí?</i>

809
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:01,976
<i>Sí.</i>

810
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,696
Uh, ¿cómo está?

811
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:27,677
What?

812
00:48:27,757 --> 00:48:31,177
Maria Elena...
She tried to kill herself.

813
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:33,847
What? Is she okay?

814
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,767
Uh...

815
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,057
Yes. I don't...
Yes, I think so. I don't know.

816
00:48:39,147 --> 00:48:40,187
I have to go.

817
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:41,357
Where are you going?

818
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:43,317
Uh...

819
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:45,397
I'm going to the hospital.

820
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,527
Should I come with you?

821
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,737
No, no, I don't think that
would be a good idea for her.

822
00:48:50,817 --> 00:48:53,027
- She's a mess.
- Well, all right.

823
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:56,117
- Call me if you want me to come, okay?
- Okay, of course.

824
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,407
Of course.

825
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:01,247
<i>Juan Antonio hurried out
in the dead of night.</i>

826
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:10,177
<i>Cristina tried to go back to sleep,
but had an uneasy feeling.</i>

827
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:14,427
<i>She dozed restively,
but awoke at the darkest hour.</i>

828
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26,398
I'm just up here making coffee.

829
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:28,278
Is everything okay?

830
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:31,988
Okay... Cristina, this is Maria Elena.

831
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:36,578
Oh.

832
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:41,788
Here you have to speak English.

833
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,078
- Please.
- I'm embarrassed.

834
00:49:44,168 --> 00:49:48,168
Oh, no...
Please, don't feel embarrassed.

835
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:50,128
Can I get you anything at all?

836
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,218
- Vodka.
- Vodka?

837
00:50:02,148 --> 00:50:03,898
In English, in English.

838
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:07,068
Maria Elena, when you are here,
you have to speak English, all right?

839
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:10,028
You want to take a shower,
you go there, in the guestroom.

840
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,278
Sí, you're a guest.

841
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:27,089
- So... what's going on?
- Nothing.

842
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,839
- What? Is everything okay?
- Nothing.

843
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:31,509
I think she's okay, yeah.

844
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:35,139
I mean, there are...

845
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:39,849
Things didn't work out
for her in Madrid,

846
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,769
and... she came bus...

847
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:45,519
she came back on the bus
tonight alone.

848
00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:51,609
Her whole world looked black
and all her plans had come to nothing,

849
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:54,609
and she overdosed in the bus terminal.

850
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:56,319
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

851
00:50:56,409 --> 00:50:58,029
Yeah, she has to stay with us.

852
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,079
What? She's gonna stay with us?

853
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,199
She has to stay with us.

854
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:04,369
I mean, she has no money,
she has no one capable of caring for her...

855
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:08,539
I mean, I-I always...

856
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:13,170
I was always her connection
to the real life.

857
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,510
Uh-huh, I understand, but I mean,
how can she stay here?

858
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,640
You know, I think...

859
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,060
I think that she can't be trusted
to stay alone, that's the problem.

860
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,810
Because, I mean, even if...
let me think...

861
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,190
even if I... if a place
could be worked out...

862
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,320
Well, maybe she needs
psychiatric help.

863
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,990
No, she's always had
bad experiences with doctors.

864
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,990
I understand,
but where is she gonna stay?

865
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,280
In there.

866
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,370
How long is she gonna stay here?

867
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,120
Cristina, I know...

868
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,040
- this is not what you had in mind.
- No... I understand.

869
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,170
But she has to stay with us.
She has no one else.

870
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,010
I understand.
It's only for a short time.

871
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,760
Yes, a few months at most.

872
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,970
She's staying for a few months?

873
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,300
Listen, I've been through this
with her before.

874
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,020
So... I mean if...

875
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,350
Shit.

876
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:10,861
If you had only known her
when I first met her.

877
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,401
I mean, her beauty...

878
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:15,651
- Her beauty took your breath away.
- Yes, I...

879
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:18,031
And she was so talented,
she was so brilliant,

880
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:19,411
she was so sensual,

881
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:23,491
and she chose me from
a hundred men ready to kill for her.

882
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:24,701
Uh-huh.

883
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:28,621
We were both sure
that our relation was perfect,

884
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,791
but there was something
missing, you know?

885
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,961
Like, love requires
such a perfect balance.

886
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,461
It's like the human body.

887
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:39,471
It may turn that you have
all the vitamins and minerals,

888
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:45,851
but if there is a minor, single,
tiny ingredient missing,

889
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:49,061
like... like... like... like... like salt,

890
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:52,061
for example, one dies.

891
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:53,941
Salt?

892
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:01,662
She's the woman I live with,

893
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:07,332
and you have to speak English
around here, please.

894
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:11,252
Yes, exactly, out of courtesy.

895
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:22,092
You always had paranoid ideas
about every woman I've ever known.

896
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:25,512
Sí.

897
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:32,562
Well, she's quite intelligent,
and she's a freethinker, like you.

898
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:34,232
- Like me?
- Yes.

899
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:54,792
Please... please, here,
in this house, speak English.

900
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:56,253
That's all I ask, all right?

901
00:53:57,713 --> 00:53:59,723
- Why are you getting so angry at me?
- Why in the world...

902
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,973
- Why are you getting so angry at me?
- Why? Listen.

903
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:04,553
Listen, why were you thinking
about killing yourself?

904
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:07,643
I mean, what a stupid idea
did cross on your mind!

905
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:10,393
I mean, try to kill yourself,
for Christ's sake!

906
00:54:11,393 --> 00:54:13,403
Stay here
until you get back on your feet,

907
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,523
and then, I beg you, please,
get out of my life.

908
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:21,703
You're too damaged.

909
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,953
And you love that.

910
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,133
Speak English!

911
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:38,463
I don't like her for you!
I don't trust her.

912
00:54:38,553 --> 00:54:41,013
And you know I always
have your best interests.

913
00:54:41,093 --> 00:54:44,473
Well, not when
you tried to kill me.

914
00:54:44,553 --> 00:54:46,053
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

915
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:47,893
That small detail, yes.

916
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:50,183
You...

917
00:54:51,274 --> 00:54:54,444
You are suspicious of her
because she is now my lover.

918
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,904
I mean, it's so obvious.

919
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:29,184
More coffee?

920
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:30,604
Yes, please.

921
00:55:33,024 --> 00:55:34,394
I'm sorry.

922
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:35,734
It's okay.

923
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:37,564
Here. Sugar.

924
00:55:37,654 --> 00:55:39,064
No, thank you.

925
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:44,904
I thought we could go
for a ride to the countryside later.

926
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:47,825
I mean, the weather is beautiful.

927
00:55:51,745 --> 00:55:53,205
In English.

928
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:55,215
Oh, no, it's fine.

929
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:57,965
You speak no Spanish?

930
00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:00,885
No. I, uh, studied Chinese.

931
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:03,555
Chinese?

932
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:07,555
Why?

933
00:56:07,645 --> 00:56:09,685
I thought it sounded pretty.

934
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:12,725
Say something in Chinese.

935
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:15,815
Me?

936
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:17,985
Mm-hmm.

937
00:56:18,065 --> 00:56:21,905
<i>Um... ni hao ma.</i>

938
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:25,035
You think that sounds pretty?

939
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:29,325
Well, maybe not the way
I'm pronouncing it, of course, but...

940
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:37,415
Speak English, Maria Elena.

941
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:44,056
Speak English.

942
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:48,516
I'm sorry. I'm nervous today.
I had bad dreams.

943
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:53,516
Would you like to paint?

944
00:56:53,606 --> 00:56:55,276
Oh, do you paint also?

945
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:58,446
Ask him. Ask him.

946
00:56:58,526 --> 00:57:01,696
He stole everything from me,
his whole style.

947
00:57:01,776 --> 00:57:04,026
She likes to make up these stories.

948
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:06,536
Antonio, your whole way
of seeing is mine.

949
00:57:06,616 --> 00:57:08,786
I'm not saying
that you were not influential.

950
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:11,576
- Influential? Influential?
- Yes. Yes, influential.

951
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,876
But to say that I stole your style...

952
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:16,376
To say that I stole your style
is too delusional.

953
00:57:26,636 --> 00:57:30,476
She always had problems with reality,
and I'm not going to get angry.

954
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:32,226
I'm not going to get angry.

955
00:57:32,306 --> 00:57:33,936
Okay, what did they say
in art school?

956
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:35,767
They said I was a genius, right?

957
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:37,857
I'm always... I always
encouraged your talent.

958
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:41,777
Not talent. I'm not talking about talent.
I said genius. Genius.

959
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,447
I came close to killing for you.

960
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,117
Yeah, you came close
to killing me with that chair.

961
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,077
I was defending myself,

962
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:51,667
and you had a razor,
and you were drunk,

963
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:53,537
with a razor and raging!

964
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,587
<i>- Never.
- Si, si, si.</i>

965
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:03,507
You wanted to kill me for looking?

966
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:10,557
I see you with someone else now,
and I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm civil.

967
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:12,137
What else do you want?

968
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:28,237
<i>As the days passed,</i>

969
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:31,248
<i>Cristina observed Maria Elena
and Juan Antonio</i>

970
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:33,918
<i>and found the heart
more puzzling than ever.</i>

971
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:47,138
Where were you?
Were you working?

972
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:49,428
- Yeah, I was trying to.
- Okay.

973
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:53,308
I'm so curious, does she really think
that you stole from her?

974
00:58:53,388 --> 00:58:54,728
Uh...

975
00:58:56,018 --> 00:59:02,068
Well, um, I guess I took
more from her than I'd like to admit, yes.

976
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:06,738
That's why I'm always so sensitive
when she brings it up.

977
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:11,488
- I feel kind of sad.
- Why?

978
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:13,828
'Cause I feel like
I'm never gonna be able to...

979
00:59:14,828 --> 00:59:17,998
to influence you
or inspire you in any way.

980
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,128
No, that's not true.

981
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,418
That's how I feel.

982
00:59:20,498 --> 00:59:21,498
That's not true.

983
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:22,668
No, that's not true.

984
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:25,429
I never heard the Scriab...
the Scriabin?

985
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:26,889
- Yeah.
- Piano Sonata?

986
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,469
Until you played those recordings for me,
and now I can't stop listening to them.

987
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,889
- No?
- No.

988
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:34,889
Well, that... makes me happy.

989
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:37,559
What?

990
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:41,149
Maybe it's not a good idea here.

991
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:42,479
What?

992
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:45,359
I mean, she's been better lately.

993
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:49,029
I don't want to... upset her.

994
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,039
Of course. No. Okay.

995
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,589
<i>It was at Vicky's afternoon language class,</i>

996
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:03,549
<i>which she took several days a week
to improve her Spanish,</i>

997
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:05,549
<i>that she met Ben, a young man</i>

998
01:00:05,629 --> 01:00:09,259
<i>who couldn't stop noticing her
and started to chat her up each day.</i>

999
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:12,809
Yeah, I can't believe
they hired me at the consulate,

1000
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:15,889
because my Spanish
is less than perfect, to say the least.

1001
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,189
No, I think it's good. It's good.

1002
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:19,520
It's all right.

1003
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,360
Are you enjoying
your time in Barcelona?

1004
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,150
Um, I would if I had more friends.

1005
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,320
Right.

1006
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,610
Yesterday I walked from the beach
up to Park Güell in search of Gaudí.

1007
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Hey, you want to see a movie?

1008
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,740
- A movie?
- Wednesday?

1009
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,160
Afternoon?

1010
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,250
Uh.

1011
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,960
Yeah.

1012
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,710
<i>The movie was a great success,</i>

1013
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,460
<i>and Ben proved to be
very good company for Vicky.</i>

1014
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,430
<i>One afternoon, they ducked
into a store to buy some cherries,</i>

1015
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,930
<i>and when the storekeeper
took a phone call in the back,</i>

1016
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,980
<i>he couldn't resist taking her hand.</i>

1017
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:59,890
Uh.

1018
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,230
Uh, no, don't.

1019
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,310
No?

1020
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,480
No...

1021
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,320
You do know
that I'm recently married?

1022
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,700
Yeah.

1023
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,041
I guess I was under the impression
that maybe you jumped into it too quick,

1024
01:01:15,121 --> 01:01:19,001
- maybe you regret it...
- Regr... ha... have I implied that?

1025
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:21,921
Unless I read into it.

1026
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:23,171
No, I...

1027
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:26,001
I shouldn't tell you this. I...

1028
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:30,761
You know what, I was always someone
who thought I knew exactly what I wanted.

1029
01:01:30,841 --> 01:01:32,721
But you didn't.

1030
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,351
Well, no, I met somebody else,

1031
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:39,351
and I'm not gonna get into that story.

1032
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:41,101
So, this guy you met...?

1033
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:44,771
The guy is living with my best friend.

1034
01:01:44,861 --> 01:01:46,941
You know, what am I talking about?

1035
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:51,201
When I... when I hear myself,
it's just... it's just crazy.

1036
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:55,121
I just married the guy I wanted.

1037
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:56,331
Did you?

1038
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:57,701
I thought so.

1039
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,371
So? What happened?

1040
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:06,541
One goddamn weekend in Oviedo.

1041
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:14,512
<i>Cristina, Juan Antonio, and Maria Elena
went riding in the country.</i>

1042
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:17,352
<i>Maria Elena had decided
they would all cook a big dinner together,</i>

1043
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:19,812
<i>and she insisted
they pick fresh blackberries.</i>

1044
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:21,062
Wait for me!

1045
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:24,902
Gives me vertigo!

1046
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:30,192
- This is the perfect...
- Here, like that.

1047
01:02:30,282 --> 01:02:31,282
- Okay.
- Like that.

1048
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:32,652
Can you get some... there.

1049
01:02:32,742 --> 01:02:35,162
- Ow, ow!
- What's wrong? What's...

1050
01:02:35,242 --> 01:02:36,662
What, what, what?

1051
01:02:36,742 --> 01:02:37,872
What happened?

1052
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:40,832
Wait, no, sit down.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1053
01:02:42,252 --> 01:02:44,422
Is it your upper or your lower?

1054
01:02:44,502 --> 01:02:45,962
- Here.
- Here?

1055
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:47,922
- Yep.
- Hold on, wait.

1056
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:50,512
- Ow.
- Let me... oh, oh, oh.

1057
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:51,842
Here, let me...

1058
01:02:55,932 --> 01:02:57,642
- You want some aspirin?
- Yeah.

1059
01:02:57,722 --> 01:02:59,352
I have aspirin in my bag.

1060
01:02:59,432 --> 01:03:00,562
- All right.
- Okay.

1061
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:02,562
You relax. I'll be right back.

1062
01:03:27,843 --> 01:03:31,303
It's all in his head.
He has so much tension.

1063
01:03:32,303 --> 01:03:34,723
To the world,
he's carefree, nothing matters,

1064
01:03:34,803 --> 01:03:37,303
"life is short and with no purpose"
kind of thing,

1065
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:41,013
but all his fear
just goes to his head.

1066
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:48,693
You know, she plays piano?

1067
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:52,823
No, I didn't know.

1068
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:54,993
Is that why you have
a piano in your house?

1069
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:57,243
No, I could have been
a concert pianist.

1070
01:03:57,324 --> 01:03:58,574
Yeah, she could have.

1071
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:01,284
I mean, no one plays
a Scarlatti like Maria Elena.

1072
01:04:01,374 --> 01:04:04,504
She understands Scarlatti,
am I right?

1073
01:04:05,504 --> 01:04:07,124
Do you play music?

1074
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:12,594
No, I just have to come face-to-face
with the fact that I am not gifted.

1075
01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:17,014
You know, I can appreciate art
and I love music, but...

1076
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:18,344
It's sad, really,

1077
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:21,604
because I feel like I have
a lot to express

1078
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:23,974
and I am not gifted.

1079
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:25,894
But you do have talent.

1080
01:04:25,984 --> 01:04:28,064
- No.
- Yes.

1081
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:30,064
What's my talent?

1082
01:04:30,154 --> 01:04:32,154
You take beautiful photographs.

1083
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:35,494
That's true. She always takes pictures
that she hides from me.

1084
01:04:35,574 --> 01:04:36,864
That's...

1085
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:39,164
No, that's because they're nothing.

1086
01:04:39,244 --> 01:04:41,164
How do you know I take pictures?

1087
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,244
I found them in your luggage.

1088
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,504
You went through my luggage?

1089
01:04:45,584 --> 01:04:47,504
Of course I went through your luggage!

1090
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,924
First night I was in the house.
I didn't trust you.

1091
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:53,045
I didn't believe you were
who you said you were.

1092
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:56,885
I wanted to know who was
really sharing the bed of my ex-husband.

1093
01:04:56,975 --> 01:04:58,685
What?!

1094
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,265
Who knew what I would find there?

1095
01:05:00,345 --> 01:05:02,685
How could I be sure
you were not going to hurt me?

1096
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,145
After all, I had thoughts of killing you.

1097
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:15,695
So here's a few more.

1098
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:19,365
Don't say you like them
if you don't like them.

1099
01:05:19,455 --> 01:05:21,995
- What are you talking about?
- They are beautiful!

1100
01:05:22,075 --> 01:05:23,875
- Yeah, you see?
- Look at this!

1101
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:28,165
<i>The next day, Maria Elena
went out photographing with Cristina.</i>

1102
01:05:28,255 --> 01:05:31,465
<i>She had a superb eye and knew a
lot about the art of photography,</i>

1103
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:35,385
<i>and taught Cristina much about the
aesthetics and subtleties of picture taking.</i>

1104
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,675
<i>She advised her
to get rid of her digital camera</i>

1105
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:40,435
<i>and use an old one
for more interesting results.</i>

1106
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,555
<i>She said it was important
to have a darkroom,</i>

1107
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:44,805
<i>and that she would set one up
in the basement for Cristina</i>

1108
01:05:44,895 --> 01:05:48,356
<i>and teach her various techniques
of developing her own pictures.</i>

1109
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,156
<i>They photographed everything,</i>

1110
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:58,746
<i>from silly-looking dogs
to grim-faced children...</i>

1111
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:02,166
<i>but the best subject
was Maria Elena herself.</i>

1112
01:06:29,356 --> 01:06:32,106
<i>Shopping one afternoon,
Vicky and Doug ran into...</i>

1113
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,316
<i>Adam Tabachnick and Sally.</i>

1114
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:37,406
<i>Adam was in the same business
Doug was in and they were friendly,</i>

1115
01:06:37,486 --> 01:06:40,406
<i>although in New York,
they did not spend a lot of time together.</i>

1116
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,207
You guys have
gotta be kidding me!

1117
01:06:42,287 --> 01:06:43,617
Hi, it's good to see you!

1118
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:46,457
Any program on TV,
obviously anything live,

1119
01:06:46,537 --> 01:06:48,837
you can play it back
on your computer.

1120
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,247
So I'm on a flight to Tokyo.

1121
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:52,467
I'm 40,000 feet up in the air,

1122
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:55,967
and I am watching the Mets,
live, on my laptop.

1123
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:57,927
It's amazing.
You're never out of touch.

1124
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:00,177
We're gonna have the new house
wired for everything.

1125
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:03,477
I'm looking at those new Japanese
high-definition TV screens.

1126
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:05,557
You've gotta have my guy
do your installation.

1127
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,187
- He's just a genius with computers and...
- I'll get his card.

1128
01:07:08,267 --> 01:07:10,567
We just did our place in Greenwich.
You have to see it!

1129
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:13,987
We have this wonderful decorator
you should use.

1130
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:17,237
He's, um, he's creative,
but he knows when to back off.

1131
01:07:17,317 --> 01:07:21,327
We did it, uh, modern, with just
a splash of antiques here and there.

1132
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:24,367
I love combining the two,
but God, the prices.

1133
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,627
Do you have any idea
what a good-sized oriental rug costs?

1134
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,497
She's right. She's right.

1135
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:33,797
Actually, there's an old joke.
"100,000 for a Persian rug..."

1136
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:48,898
<i>Life continued predictably
for Vicky and Doug,</i>

1137
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:52,648
<i>until one afternoon,
when an unpredictable moment occurred.</i>

1138
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:08,708
<i>Several days later,
Judy asked Vicky to meet her privately,</i>

1139
01:08:08,788 --> 01:08:10,708
<i>away from the house,
to have coffee.</i>

1140
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,418
What happened the other day...

1141
01:08:15,218 --> 01:08:17,378
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1142
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:21,388
- It's really none of my business.
- I'm not having an affair with Mark's partner.

1143
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:23,388
I'm... I'm not.

1144
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:25,478
No, I didn't think you were.

1145
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:28,518
Mm, uh, not that
I haven't had fantasies

1146
01:08:28,598 --> 01:08:33,439
of someone coming along
and taking me out of my situation,

1147
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:38,449
but the fantasies are not Jay Lewis...

1148
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:41,489
even though he would like that, he would.

1149
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:45,079
By "taking you out of your situation"...?

1150
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:52,209
I haven't... I haven't been in love
with Mark for years.

1151
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:56,379
I mean, I love him,
but I'm not in love with him.

1152
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:59,179
I'm sorry to hear that.

1153
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:02,639
It's funny, I just made...

1154
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:07,929
I just made the same speech
to my shrink. Huh.

1155
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,349
Well, what does your shrink say?

1156
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:17,529
He says, um, that I'm
too frightened to act and that...

1157
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:21,659
that I'm looking for some kind
of magical solution

1158
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:25,409
which is unrealistic, and that I...

1159
01:09:25,489 --> 01:09:28,450
And an affair is not the answer.

1160
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,460
And I don't... I'm sorry to be
laying all of this on you,

1161
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,380
but I was so humiliated
when you saw us.

1162
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,960
- Look...
- I'm just...

1163
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:40,220
Look, you mustn't feel that you
have to explain yourself to me.

1164
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,680
I mean...

1165
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,560
Mark is great.

1166
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,310
I'm sure any...

1167
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:55,270
any dissatisfaction I have
is my own problem.

1168
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,230
I'm just...

1169
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,910
I can't leave him,
and I know that I never will.

1170
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:07,200
Hmm, why not?

1171
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,830
I just... I can't.

1172
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,080
I'm too scared.

1173
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,590
The moment's passed.

1174
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:38,901
It's so apparent to me that you
and Juan Antonio are still in love

1175
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:41,241
when I see you together, you know?

1176
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,611
Our love will last forever.

1177
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:45,781
It's forever, but it just doesn't work.

1178
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:48,161
That's why it will always
be romantic,

1179
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:50,491
because it cannot be complete.

1180
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:54,251
Maybe it can't be complete because,
you know, I'm getting in the way,

1181
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:56,211
- or I don't know, I feel like...
- No.

1182
01:10:56,291 --> 01:11:00,251
Before you... before you,
we used to cause each other

1183
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,091
so much pain, so much suffering.

1184
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:04,591
Without you, all this
would not be possible.

1185
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,301
You know why? Because you
are the missing ingredient.

1186
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:10,101
You are like the tint that,

1187
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:12,641
added to a palette,
makes the color beautiful.

1188
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:16,442
Aren't you and Juan Antonio
tempted to make love?

1189
01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:18,442
I feel like...

1190
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,442
I don't know.

1191
01:11:20,532 --> 01:11:22,742
At the end of our marriage, we didn't,

1192
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:25,572
but I have to say,
those feelings are coming back now,

1193
01:11:25,662 --> 01:11:27,492
thanks to you,

1194
01:11:27,572 --> 01:11:30,162
in a new and deeper way.

1195
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:31,952
Well, I wouldn't be upset about it.

1196
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:35,002
I'd never want to get into the way.
It wouldn't upset me at all.

1197
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,422
I know you wouldn't be upset,

1198
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:39,632
same way I get this warm feeling

1199
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,342
when I hear you both
locked in passion every night.

1200
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:46,262
I listen, and I'm happy.

1201
01:11:47,392 --> 01:11:50,762
<i>Was Cristina okay with it
when Maria Elena and Juan Antonio</i>

1202
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:52,772
<i>made love one afternoon?</i>

1203
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:56,442
<i>Beforehand, she gave them both her
blessing, but then had mixed feelings.</i>

1204
01:11:56,522 --> 01:12:00,112
<i>She was not quite as open-minded
as she had always imagined herself,</i>

1205
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:03,612
<i>and the thought of the two of them
in bed and, inevitably, full of intensity,</i>

1206
01:12:03,692 --> 01:12:05,572
<i>caused her some conflict.</i>

1207
01:12:05,652 --> 01:12:09,663
<i>In the end, she gradually relaxed
and let herself go with the flow of things,</i>

1208
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:11,623
<i>a tolerance she was proud of.</i>

1209
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:14,453
At first it did bother me,

1210
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:18,003
but then I started to think about all these
standard, accepted clichés of love...

1211
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,423
what's right, what's wrong,

1212
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:23,213
what's appropriate according
to the "appropriate police,"

1213
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:25,673
and you know, you see
how screwed up most relation...

1214
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:27,633
So what you're saying is
you're sharing a man.

1215
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:28,973
You're like a Mormon wife.

1216
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,933
I-I know it sounds strange,

1217
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,143
but actually, we all contribute
to the relationship,

1218
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,563
and we're all really nourished by it.

1219
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:36,313
If everyone did that,
society couldn't function.

1220
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,563
- Come on!
- Come on, Doug.

1221
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:40,523
Let's not get into one of those
turgid categorical imperative arguments.

1222
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:41,863
- Whatever works.
- Whatever works?

1223
01:12:41,943 --> 01:12:44,443
Maria Elena believes that there are
many truths in life, not just one.

1224
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,823
I don't know. I mean, babe,
could you live like that?

1225
01:12:46,903 --> 01:12:50,453
Well, I never had Cristina's...

1226
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,743
What, Cristina's lack of structure?

1227
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,243
It's very structured, actually.

1228
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,833
Her courage.
I never had her courage.

1229
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,083
Her courage?

1230
01:12:57,163 --> 01:12:59,793
Courage? Next thing she'll be
going to bed with Maria Elena

1231
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:04,424
and glorifying it as some kind
of superior, alternative lifestyle.

1232
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:06,054
Oh, I have gone to bed with her.

1233
01:13:06,134 --> 01:13:07,884
- No!
- Yeah.

1234
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:09,264
When?

1235
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:13,434
Well, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
made this darkroom for me...

1236
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,814
you know, they're both pushing me
to take photographs...

1237
01:13:15,894 --> 01:13:17,684
and actually, I'm getting pretty good.

1238
01:13:17,774 --> 01:13:20,524
Believe it or not,
I'm getting much more confident.

1239
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:23,154
<i>And we were down there
in the darkroom,</i>

1240
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:26,984
<i>and... I was just working on
some of my photographs,</i>

1241
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:30,864
<i>things that, you know, I wouldn't
have done if she hadn't inspired me.</i>

1242
01:14:35,435 --> 01:14:38,065
And it happened
very naturally for both of us.

1243
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:40,935
You weren't nervous?

1244
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:44,855
No, no. It was very loving and gentle.

1245
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:46,365
Did you enjoy it?

1246
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,825
Mm-hmm, I did.

1247
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:52,405
And... it was just the one time?

1248
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:53,655
Yeah, yeah.

1249
01:14:53,745 --> 01:14:55,536
I mean, it just happened, you know.

1250
01:14:55,626 --> 01:14:59,496
I'm not planning on making
a habit out of it, necessarily.

1251
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:03,546
But if you... enjoyed it...

1252
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:06,336
- I did, I did at the time.
- Well, did you tell Juan Antonio?

1253
01:15:06,426 --> 01:15:08,176
Yeah, of course.
There's nothing to hide.

1254
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:11,266
Would you say
then you are a bisexual?

1255
01:15:11,346 --> 01:15:13,266
No, I see no reason
to label everything.

1256
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:14,846
I'm me, you know,

1257
01:15:14,936 --> 01:15:19,226
and I've slept with Juan Antonio since
and enjoyed that experience very much.

1258
01:15:19,316 --> 01:15:21,686
It's a great story.

1259
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:26,236
Yeah, that's a great story.

1260
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:30,696
Hey, look, I don't set
myself up as a judge, so...

1261
01:15:34,616 --> 01:15:36,246
What are you thinking?

1262
01:15:36,326 --> 01:15:38,416
Hmm?

1263
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,126
I don't know.

1264
01:15:40,206 --> 01:15:42,796
How quickly time passes.

1265
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:45,336
Summer's almost over.

1266
01:15:45,426 --> 01:15:47,756
We'll be going home soon.

1267
01:15:50,097 --> 01:15:53,307
I thought you were still dwelling
about your friend's

1268
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,887
little tale of lust in the darkroom.

1269
01:15:57,937 --> 01:16:00,397
And speaking of dark rooms...

1270
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:02,397
Come here.

1271
01:16:28,587 --> 01:16:29,837
<i>Over the next weeks,</i>

1272
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:32,967
<i>Cristina became more and more sure
of herself as a photographer.</i>

1273
01:16:33,057 --> 01:16:36,727
<i>Both Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
contributed ideas and support</i>

1274
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:38,097
<i>when she had doubts.</i>

1275
01:16:38,187 --> 01:16:39,687
<i>Thanks to their encouragement,</i>

1276
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:42,857
<i>photography was becoming
a productive interest in her life.</i>

1277
01:16:42,937 --> 01:16:48,238
<i>By now, she and Juan Antonio
and Maria Elena had become lovers.</i>

1278
01:17:00,578 --> 01:17:04,458
<i>Everything seemed perfectly balanced,
perfectly in tune.</i>

1279
01:17:04,548 --> 01:17:07,088
<i>Maria Elena was calm and relaxed.</i>

1280
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:11,928
<i>Juan Antonio was going through
a very creative period with his painting.</i>

1281
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:15,718
<i>It was only Cristina,
as the last days of summer expired,</i>

1282
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:18,678
<i>who began to experience
an old familiar stirring,</i>

1283
01:17:18,768 --> 01:17:20,938
<i>a growing restlessness
that she dreaded,</i>

1284
01:17:21,018 --> 01:17:24,148
<i>but recognized only too well.</i>

1285
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,778
<i>Suddenly, thoughts started
taking precedence over feelings,</i>

1286
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:30,528
<i>thoughts and questions
about life and love,</i>

1287
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:32,948
<i>and as much as she tried
to resist these ideas,</i>

1288
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,278
<i>she could not get them
from her mind.</i>

1289
01:17:35,368 --> 01:17:38,659
<i>Finally, summoning her resolve
one evening after dinner,</i>

1290
01:17:38,749 --> 01:17:41,169
<i>she made an announcement
that surprised everyone.</i>

1291
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:42,999
I don't want what my parents had,

1292
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:45,589
I don't want what I had
before I came here...

1293
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:49,759
I mean, I know that...
but I know I can't live like this forever.

1294
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:56,099
- What do you want, Cristina?
- I want something different.

1295
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:57,469
What?

1296
01:17:57,559 --> 01:17:59,639
I-I don't know.

1297
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:01,269
Not this.

1298
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:05,729
There is no answer, Cristina.
There is no single answer.

1299
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:11,449
Please, don't get so upset.

1300
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:14,659
Please, and can you speak English?
I can't understand you.

1301
01:18:26,089 --> 01:18:28,339
Maria Elena, speak English, please,

1302
01:18:28,419 --> 01:18:30,089
so she can understand it, all right?

1303
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,350
Chronic dissatisfaction,
that's what you have.

1304
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,600
Chronic dissatisfaction.

1305
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,220
Big sickness.

1306
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,020
Do you know how much we love you?

1307
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:50,150
And I love you both.

1308
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,360
- No, you don't.
- Yes I... it has nothing to do with that.

1309
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:56,120
- Please, please!
- I just can't live...

1310
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,930
Where will you go, Cristina?

1311
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,270
I, um...

1312
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,850
I just gotta get out of here
for a few weeks,

1313
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,351
and I just gotta clear my head.

1314
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:30,611
It's not... this is all my... problem.

1315
01:19:30,691 --> 01:19:32,191
It has nothing to do with you.

1316
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:33,531
Then come here.

1317
01:19:35,611 --> 01:19:37,281
Oy.

1318
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:43,621
Let's be thankful
for all of the good times

1319
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:47,001
that we've spent together,
all right, and...

1320
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:51,921
and remember each other
with respect,

1321
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:54,761
all right, and love and affection.

1322
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:57,721
All right?

1323
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,891
<i>Cristina told
all that had happened to Vicky,</i>

1324
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:09,061
<i>and said she was going to France
for a few weeks to think things out.</i>

1325
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:10,651
<i>She would return to pick her up</i>

1326
01:20:10,731 --> 01:20:12,901
<i>so they could go back
to New York together.</i>

1327
01:20:19,991 --> 01:20:22,242
So it's been Juan Antonio
all this time?

1328
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:25,542
Look, I'm not gonna do anything.
Forget I said...

1329
01:20:25,622 --> 01:20:28,622
I just needed to tell someone,
and we've become close, so...

1330
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:30,792
- Why don't you act on it?
- What, act now?

1331
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:35,172
Break up with Doug?
He's really a sweet guy.

1332
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:37,302
He married me in good faith.

1333
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:40,892
For what?
For a bohemian Spanish painter

1334
01:20:40,972 --> 01:20:43,602
with a passionate tie to an ex-wife

1335
01:20:43,682 --> 01:20:47,562
who probably doesn't even
share my feelings, if he ever did,

1336
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,272
so... oh, God, who am I kidding?

1337
01:20:50,362 --> 01:20:52,772
But the dream is exciting.

1338
01:20:52,862 --> 01:20:55,282
If I were you,
I wouldn't waste another minute.

1339
01:20:55,362 --> 01:20:57,242
- I'd get on it.
- Get on what?

1340
01:20:57,322 --> 01:20:59,322
Well, you're in love with him. If...

1341
01:20:59,412 --> 01:21:04,582
Do something, or the years will pass by
and you will be sorry, Vicky.

1342
01:21:04,662 --> 01:21:06,582
No, no, what are you saying? I...

1343
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:09,672
Look, I can't risk everything.

1344
01:21:09,752 --> 01:21:12,712
If Juan Antonio had never existed,

1345
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:15,462
- I'd be fine with Doug.
- Just fine.

1346
01:21:15,552 --> 01:21:17,383
- Yeah, as I planned.
- Just fine?

1347
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:19,423
How blunt do you want me to be?

1348
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:22,593
When I look at Doug, I see Mark.

1349
01:21:22,683 --> 01:21:26,563
Yeah, well, you're using me
to rewrite your own history.

1350
01:21:27,433 --> 01:21:29,233
<i>Despite Vicky's protestations,</i>

1351
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:33,113
<i>Judy was possessed with finding a way
to bring her and Juan Antonio together,</i>

1352
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:36,903
<i>and prevailed upon her friend Gabriella,
who was a figure in the art world,</i>

1353
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:40,243
<i>to throw a party and invite
Vicky and Juan Antonio.</i>

1354
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:44,123
<i>Meanwhile, as predicted,
without Cristina</i>

1355
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,703
<i>the relationship between
Juan Antonio and Maria Elena</i>

1356
01:21:46,793 --> 01:21:48,663
<i>had gone back
to its old destructiveness.</i>

1357
01:22:09,353 --> 01:22:11,524
<i>As had happened before
by mutual consent,</i>

1358
01:22:11,604 --> 01:22:15,154
<i>Maria Elena packed her things
and moved out of Juan Antonio's house.</i>

1359
01:22:29,954 --> 01:22:32,164
Yeah, I think he's sweet.
I mean, he owns...

1360
01:22:33,174 --> 01:22:35,504
- He gets in very close.
- Yeah, he does.

1361
01:22:35,594 --> 01:22:37,924
He's a close talker.
He's a close talker.

1362
01:22:39,514 --> 01:22:41,554
That's probably why he's so successful.

1363
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:46,264
I was telling her on the car ride
over here that I'm actually very excited.

1364
01:22:46,354 --> 01:22:48,474
I think he's gonna be a great contact.

1365
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:51,104
I'm gonna go check out the food.
Does anyone want anything?

1366
01:22:51,184 --> 01:22:52,234
- No.
- No.

1367
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:53,524
Thank you.

1368
01:22:53,604 --> 01:22:55,734
But he gets in your face.

1369
01:22:55,814 --> 01:22:57,814
No, no, I mean,
he'll get a little close...

1370
01:23:04,164 --> 01:23:05,414
Hello.

1371
01:23:08,995 --> 01:23:11,455
Oh... hello.

1372
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:13,505
I'm surprised to see you.

1373
01:23:16,335 --> 01:23:18,095
As am I to see you.

1374
01:23:18,175 --> 01:23:19,925
I didn't think you liked parties.

1375
01:23:20,005 --> 01:23:23,175
Yeah, well, Gabriella insisted I come,
and she's an old friend.

1376
01:23:24,685 --> 01:23:27,935
You know, of course, that Cristina
and I are no longer together, right?

1377
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:29,265
Yes.

1378
01:23:29,355 --> 01:23:32,395
So now you're just
with your ex-wife?

1379
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:34,355
No, Maria Elena is gone, as well.

1380
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:36,485
Oh. For now.

1381
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:40,865
It's funny. Maria Elena and I...

1382
01:23:40,945 --> 01:23:43,285
We are meant for each other
and not meant for each other.

1383
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:45,745
It's... it's a contradiction.

1384
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:49,455
I mean, in order to understand it
you need a poet like my father...

1385
01:23:50,455 --> 01:23:51,955
because I don't.

1386
01:23:54,335 --> 01:23:55,715
Well...

1387
01:23:55,795 --> 01:23:57,255
How about you?

1388
01:23:57,335 --> 01:23:59,135
All goes well
with your husband, I'm sure?

1389
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:01,676
Oh, yes. Yes, he's wonderful.

1390
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:03,306
He's terrific.

1391
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:06,306
I'm quite delighted with
the way things turned out.

1392
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:09,556
Why don't I believe you?

1393
01:24:12,226 --> 01:24:14,226
Don't become flirtatious.

1394
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,196
You know, I realize
your bed is empty now

1395
01:24:17,276 --> 01:24:19,486
and you always had
a little yen for me,

1396
01:24:19,566 --> 01:24:22,326
but we're preparing
to leave by the weekend, so...

1397
01:24:22,406 --> 01:24:24,036
Meet me for lunch.

1398
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:29,326
I'm too scared.

1399
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:33,206
No. What?

1400
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:35,956
You're breaking up, Tom.

1401
01:24:36,966 --> 01:24:38,876
You're breaking up.

1402
01:24:38,966 --> 01:24:40,296
Where are you?

1403
01:24:41,296 --> 01:24:43,006
Okay, that's better.

1404
01:24:43,096 --> 01:24:45,176
That's better.
Just try to stand still.

1405
01:24:46,346 --> 01:24:47,846
Can you hear me?

1406
01:24:47,936 --> 01:24:51,856
We have to get a bird
for Mark and Judy.

1407
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:53,726
No, we can't get them a bird.

1408
01:24:53,816 --> 01:24:55,186
- Why not?
- It's ridiculous.

1409
01:24:55,276 --> 01:24:57,777
They're beautiful.
I always wanted a bird.

1410
01:24:57,857 --> 01:25:01,777
When we get home, I'd love to get,
like, a bird for the new house.

1411
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:03,117
Yeah?

1412
01:25:03,197 --> 01:25:06,497
Yeah, and I'm leaning
towards Bedford Hills.

1413
01:25:06,577 --> 01:25:08,407
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1414
01:25:08,497 --> 01:25:10,617
All right, well, hold on.

1415
01:25:12,537 --> 01:25:13,787
Hello?

1416
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:16,297
Spend tomorrow afternoon with me.

1417
01:25:17,297 --> 01:25:19,507
- Oh, no, it's not possible.
- Hey, buddy!

1418
01:25:19,587 --> 01:25:21,757
We're preparing
to leave by the weekend.

1419
01:25:21,837 --> 01:25:25,427
Be on the corner of Calles Tiles,
Tiles, in Pedrables,

1420
01:25:25,517 --> 01:25:29,097
and I'll drive by
and I'll pick you up at noon.

1421
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:32,517
Uh, no. You're wasting your time.

1422
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,227
I can't talk now.

1423
01:25:34,317 --> 01:25:36,267
Look, I'm not the kind of man

1424
01:25:36,357 --> 01:25:39,437
who would try to come
between a husband and wife... I'm not.

1425
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:43,737
I'm not, but Judy Nash called me
and she tells me that you are not happy,

1426
01:25:43,817 --> 01:25:47,447
that you are actually more in love
with me than the man you married.

1427
01:25:48,447 --> 01:25:49,497
I can't talk.

1428
01:25:56,998 --> 01:25:59,838
This is nice.
Yeah. Really nice.

1429
01:26:01,838 --> 01:26:03,218
Hey, babe.

1430
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:04,888
What do you think?

1431
01:26:04,968 --> 01:26:06,098
Who was that?

1432
01:26:06,178 --> 01:26:07,218
Hmm?

1433
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:08,308
On the phone.

1434
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:11,808
Oh, it was... it's my,
uh, language teacher.

1435
01:26:11,888 --> 01:26:12,888
Yeah?

1436
01:26:14,898 --> 01:26:19,068
He wants me to have a good-bye lunch
with him tomorrow at noon.

1437
01:26:19,148 --> 01:26:20,148
Oh, that's perfect.

1438
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:22,278
I'm gonna play golf with Mark
in the morning.

1439
01:27:32,929 --> 01:27:34,059
Well, this is...

1440
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,399
Oh, I've been working
on these ones lately.

1441
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,360
Uh, yeah.

1442
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,740
They're very overwhelming, my God.

1443
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:49,410
Yeah. I mean, it's very hard
to explain the painting, all right?

1444
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:52,450
No, you don't have to.
It's fascinating. It's fascinating.

1445
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,870
This one, actually,
should be the other way around.

1446
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,540
I like it very much.

1447
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:04,880
Can... can I... can I be frank
about something?

1448
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:05,970
Yeah.

1449
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:11,180
This one, it's... it's... there's
something very frightening about it.

1450
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:15,100
- Uh, that one is Maria Elena's.
- Right, well, that explains it.

1451
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:19,770
It's very chaotic
and erratic, almost, but...

1452
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:23,570
Oh, God,
what am I doing here?

1453
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,940
I don't know what I expect to happen.

1454
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:29,820
It's been a long time
since we made love that night in Oviedo...

1455
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,910
Yes, I...

1456
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:32,830
...and I've thought about it
many, many times.

1457
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:34,411
I'm sure you weren't
thinking about it

1458
01:28:34,501 --> 01:28:37,251
when you were making love
to Cristina or Maria Elena...

1459
01:28:37,331 --> 01:28:38,961
I never lied to you.

1460
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:43,591
I mean, I told you from the first moment
I was attracted to both you and Cristina.

1461
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:44,841
Yeah, look...

1462
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:49,931
I can't just go to bed with you.
I'm... I'm not good at this.

1463
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:51,761
But you weren't nervous that night.

1464
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:54,601
- I wasn't married.
- You were about to be.

1465
01:28:54,681 --> 01:28:57,271
Yeah, you're right.
It's what I want.

1466
01:28:57,351 --> 01:29:00,811
But I... what am I supposed to do,
make love with you and then...

1467
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:03,691
and then go on with my marriage
like nothing happened,

1468
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:05,531
or just terminate it?

1469
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:08,451
Judy Nash says you
are heading an unhappy life.

1470
01:29:08,531 --> 01:29:10,991
Well, she's talking about herself.

1471
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:14,871
Maybe you will understand
more about your own feelings

1472
01:29:14,951 --> 01:29:16,291
once we've made love.

1473
01:29:16,371 --> 01:29:17,501
Yeah, or less.

1474
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:20,121
Look, I'm not saying
I'm not tempted,

1475
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:23,631
but it would require
such an upheaval emotionally.

1476
01:29:23,711 --> 01:29:26,051
And from a practical point of view,

1477
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,091
you're not exactly
the kind of man to plan a...

1478
01:29:30,972 --> 01:29:32,262
Maria Elena!

1479
01:29:32,342 --> 01:29:34,222
No, no! Maria Elena!

1480
01:29:34,312 --> 01:29:37,182
What are you doing? Don't!

1481
01:29:50,492 --> 01:29:53,282
<i>Dámela,
dámela, dámela. Ya, ya.</i>

1482
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:10,552
Maria Elena. Maria Elena. Maria Elena.

1483
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:14,932
Maria Elena.

1484
01:30:26,653 --> 01:30:28,613
- My God!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

1485
01:30:28,693 --> 01:30:29,943
Oh, my God, my hand!

1486
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:35,243
You're both crazy!
You're both complete...

1487
01:30:35,323 --> 01:30:37,783
Both of you are completely insane!

1488
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:40,203
How the hell am I gonna
explain this to my husband?

1489
01:30:40,293 --> 01:30:42,083
- I'm sorry.
- I can't live like this!

1490
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,753
This is not my life!

1491
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,293
Maria Elena. Maria Elena.

1492
01:30:49,713 --> 01:30:52,473
I still don't understand
what your language teacher

1493
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:53,723
was doing with a gun.

1494
01:30:53,803 --> 01:30:56,553
Look, I told you,
he collects these antique firearms,

1495
01:30:56,643 --> 01:30:58,683
- and he was showing me...
- God! We should sue him.

1496
01:30:58,763 --> 01:31:00,933
- It just went off.
- That is so damn irresponsible.

1497
01:31:01,023 --> 01:31:02,603
- No, no, it's not.
- Jesus.

1498
01:31:02,693 --> 01:31:05,233
- Once the bandages come off...
- What if something happened to you?

1499
01:31:05,313 --> 01:31:06,733
...it'll be a scratch. What?

1500
01:31:06,813 --> 01:31:08,193
What are you saying?

1501
01:31:08,273 --> 01:31:10,903
I love you so much.

1502
01:31:10,993 --> 01:31:13,073
<i>Doug never found out
the real story.</i>

1503
01:31:16,123 --> 01:31:18,494
<i>Judy knew the secret,
and of course was relieved...</i>

1504
01:31:18,584 --> 01:31:20,994
<i>Vicky had not been
hurt worse, or killed.</i>

1505
01:31:22,004 --> 01:31:24,124
<i>With Vicky leaving
to go back to New York,</i>

1506
01:31:24,214 --> 01:31:26,584
<i>Judy's plans to rescue Vicky
from her own fate</i>

1507
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:28,594
<i>were put on terminal hold.</i>

1508
01:31:32,514 --> 01:31:35,764
<i>When Cristina returned from Antibes
Vicky told her the whole tale,</i>

1509
01:31:35,844 --> 01:31:39,104
<i>and Cristina thought it was sad
how much Vicky had wanted Juan Antonio</i>

1510
01:31:39,184 --> 01:31:41,684
<i>and was unable to say
or do anything about it.</i>

1511
01:31:41,774 --> 01:31:43,434
But I would've stepped aside.

1512
01:31:43,524 --> 01:31:46,604
No, no. Look, I knew you
had feelings for Juan Antonio

1513
01:31:46,694 --> 01:31:48,274
from the moment you saw him.

1514
01:31:48,364 --> 01:31:51,774
But if I knew what had happened,
I never would've gone ahead with it.

1515
01:31:51,864 --> 01:31:55,704
It was a... passing thing.

1516
01:31:56,994 --> 01:31:58,574
Now it's over.

1517
01:32:26,315 --> 01:32:29,485
<i>Vicky went home to have
her grand wedding to Doug,</i>

1518
01:32:29,565 --> 01:32:32,075
<i>to the house they both
finally settled on,</i>

1519
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:34,615
<i>and to lead the life
she had envisioned for herself</i>

1520
01:32:34,695 --> 01:32:36,745
<i>before the summer in Barcelona.</i>

1521
01:32:37,745 --> 01:32:40,455
<i>Cristina continued searching,</i>

1522
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:43,625
<i>certain only of what she didn't want.</i>
