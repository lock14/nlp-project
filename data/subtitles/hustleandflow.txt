00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,878
See...

3
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:03,180
...man ain't like a dog.

4
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,548
And when I say "man,"

5
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,392
I'm talking about man
as in mankind, not man as in men.

6
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:10,964
Because men,

7
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,329
well, we a lot like a dog.

8
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:16,275
You know, we like to piss on things.

9
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,699
Sniff a bitch when we can.

10
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:21,772
Even get a little pink hard-on
the way they do.

11
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:25,618
We territorial as shit, you know,
we gonna protect our own.

12
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,730
But man...

13
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:30,414
...he know about death.

14
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:33,108
Got him a sense of history.

15
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,053
Got religion.

16
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:36,630
See...

17
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,253
...a dog...

18
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:42,733
Man, a dog don't know shit
about no birthdays or Christmas

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,943
or Easter bunny, none of that shit.

20
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:46,573
And one day
God gonna come calling,

21
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:48,980
so, you know,
they going through life carefree.

22
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,341
But people like you and me, man,
we always guessing.

23
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:55,669
Wondering, "What if?"
You know what I mean?

24
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,344
So when you say to me,

25
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,139
"Hey, I don't think
we should be doing this,"

26
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:04,305
I gotta say, baby, I don't think
we need to be doing this neither,

27
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,288
but we ain't gonna get no move on
in this world, lying around in the sun,

28
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,336
licking our ass all day.

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,254
I mean, we man.

30
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:15,063
I mean, you a woman and all,
but we man.

31
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,066
So with this said...

32
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:23,386
...you tell me what it is
you wanna do with your life.

33
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,044
I don't know.

34
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:42,108
- I mean, I guess I could, like...
- Hold up a second.

35
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,537
What's happening with you, man?

36
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:52,987
You like what you see, huh?

37
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:57,628
Look here, baby,
it break down like this:

38
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,213
Twenty in the front, 40 in the back.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,258
Hello?

40
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,602
Why don't you walk over there
and explain it to that motherfucker.

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,179
- Damn.
- From the D&Z sports desk,

42
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,838
I'm Dennis Phillippi, and the answer...

43
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,703
- Hot 107. 1, number one for hip-hop...
- Nothing but a bunch of jive and junk.

44
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,807
Coming up, your chance
to win a trip to Las Vegas.

45
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,842
Holler at your boy, it's Hot 107. 1.

46
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,708
- Please! Fucking with me, man! Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

47
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:05,923
Hey, what the hell?!

48
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,099
- Pull that shit again,
- Motherfucker, how you like that?

49
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,577
Boot your ass to hell.

50
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,559
- You heard me!
- Get the fuck up out of here.

51
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,830
Deranged son of a bitch!

52
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:22,243
- You all right, Nola?
- Thanks, D.

53
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:25,643
Come on in, man. Come on in here.

54
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,260
Damn, man, you gotta
get some security up in here.

55
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm the only
motherfucking security in here.

56
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,925
Sure is good
not to be cracking heads.

57
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,941
So, what you need, man,
a half or full O?

58
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,583
Ounce will do good.
Fourth coming up and all.

59
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,571
Righteous, man.

60
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,395
Hey, you remember
that sticky herb you brung up

61
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,567
to my brother's house for playoffs?

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,637
Yeah, I remember that shit.
That ain't this, now, man.

63
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,680
We talking about... That's
a whole other zip-up bag on that.

64
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,466
That's fucking prime product
right there.

65
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,889
We got some big company
coming in here for the Fourth.

66
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,610
Thought you may want
to get you some money.

67
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,336
- Big company?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:06,354
- Like what?
- You know Skinny Black?

69
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,981
Skinny Black.

70
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,034
Yeah, that...
Yeah, I know who Skinny is, man.

71
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:12,233
I know Skinny from
way back in the day.

72
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,574
See, I know Skinny
when he was hustling

73
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,161
his underground tapes
down at the drive-in,

74
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,534
out the back of his Cutlass.

75
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:23,146
Not no more he ain't.
Last one he put out went platinum.

76
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:25,552
- Platinum?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,367
- That's more special than gold, right?
- But he's still in Memphis.

78
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,348
He and his brother Tigga hook up with
their friends every Fourth of July.

79
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,350
I shut the place down,
make it all private for them.

80
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,175
And they just buy me out.

81
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:37,999
- Bullshit.
- No shit.

82
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,627
Yo, Skinny rolling like that, man?

83
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,580
Best get your ass up here
with that good shit.

84
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,562
Those boys don't want
none of this dirt weed.

85
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,831
So you're trying
to hurt my feelings, right?

86
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,195
- Just trying to help out a friend.
- For sure, man.

87
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,326
All right, all right, all right,
goddamn it,

88
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:04,844
we're going into a 2-for-1

89
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:06,096
You gonna love this shit.

90
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:09,428
These lovely ladies will be doing
two dances for the price of one.

91
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,276
We got Luscious, we got Phoebe
and we got Lexus

00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,147

94
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,971
- What's happening, baby?
- Wet out there, huh?

95
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,151
Yeah, sorry, man.

96
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:21,109
- It's like a motherfucker.
- All right.

97
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,832
Hey, baby.

98
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:32,182
- Hey, where Lex at?
- Over there on satellite one.

99
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,049
Don't miss out. Take advantage.

100
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:39,285
We got Monique coming up

101
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,788
- You'll love this, 2-for-1.
- What the fuck? Will you let me...

102
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:52,502
These lovely ladies will be giving you
two dances for the price of one.

103
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,669
- Come here. Excuse me, daddy.
- Don't you see me on a hustle?

104
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,243
- Where you at?
- I ain't at shit.

105
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:58,964
- I was on my third dance.
- Don't tell me...

106
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,076
You think I can just run up in here,
snap my fingers

107
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,187
and make these motherfuckers
throw their money at me?

108
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,871
- Watch your motherfucking tone...
- I ain't even made payout yet!

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,630
This one is pretty good.

110
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,220
My motherfucking house
got broken into too, bitch.

111
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,830
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yeah, they kicked

112
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:16,765
both my doors in, girl. Stole the last
pound of hydro weed for the party.

113
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,231
You hear that?

114
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,839
That's my gut saying,
"Hurry the fuck up," okay?

115
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,239
- Come on.
- Look at this.

116
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:29,694
Hell, no. Look at this shit. What
the fuck you call that, the clapper?

117
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,639
Lights on, lights off. Don't play.
I'm gonna roll tonight.

118
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,958
I don't care what you say, D,
I ain't working day shift no more.

119
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,061
I don't care if I got to
take me a taxi ride home.

120
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,974
- You gonna work if I say you gonna.
- I ain't working with these skank-ass,

121
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,723
- trucker-bait ho's no more.
- Kiss my ass.

122
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:48,343
- Bitch, fucking take my shit again.
- Shit don't make no sense.

123
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,808
If I'd known y'all was gonna take your
sweet fucking time, I'd have come in.

124
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,938
Trudy says she made $500
last night, $500, you heard me?

125
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,474
- Bitch got that birthmark on her face?
- Five hundred dollars

126
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:59,773
for dancing for some man
who makes cotton.

127
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,914
- What she do for him? She tricking.
- It ain't fair.

128
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,221
I'm tricking! I ain't making $500.

129
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,500
- What the hell, fool?!
- Hey!

130
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,391
- D. Djay.
- Get your ass away from our car.

131
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,857
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Hey, D!

132
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,224
- It's only me, it's Harold.
- Get the fuck away from my car!

133
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,309
- It's me, Harold, Djay.
- Get away from my car, man.

134
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:15,876
- It's your dog.
- You're lucky as shit,

135
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,136
that's normally my barrels
under my fucking seat, motherfucker.

136
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:22,912
- It's Djay, nigga!
- Okay, Djay, I didn't mean no harm.

137
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,896
You got any of
that crankity-crank shit?

138
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:27,775
Nigga, I'm gateway mother... Man,
don't waste my time on no bullshit.

139
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:30,014
Wait, wait, wait. Check this out.
Check this out.

140
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:31,589
Check this out.
What can I get for this?

141
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,571
You think I look like
a pawnshop, man?

142
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,677
Is that...? I got "pawnshop"
written on my forehead?

143
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,018
Come on, Djay, fuck with me.

144
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,485
- Fuck with me, Djay.
- Where you get it?

145
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,502
You know the business.

146
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,414
- You took that shit from little kids?
- No, none of that, man.

147
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,455
I used to play this thing myself,
all the time.

148
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,558
- That shit work?
- Man, like a pro!

149
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,491
Let me see that motherfucker, man.

150
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:01,252
Yeah, man, I used to have
one of these when I was a little kid.

151
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,146
- Shit wasn't as big, though.
- But that's bigger and better.

152
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:07,361
Fuck with me, now, D.

153
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,148
- Fuck with me, Djay!
- Shut the fuck up, man.

154
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,994
- Nigga, I'll give you a quarter for it.
- A quarter?

155
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,154
Man, you mean a half and some. I can
get more than that at the pawnshop.

156
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:19,495
Take that shit to the pawnshop,
let's see what you get.

157
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,797
No, take it over there, man.
Give them your thumbprint.

158
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,095
- You on. You got it, you got it.
- Hey, give me that bag, man.

159
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,015
Shit.

160
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,700
You the man. You got it going on.
It's all good.

161
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,428
Nigga, you advertising my shit

162
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,635
It's okay, I'm gonna
fuck with you anyhow. It's all good.

163
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:35,976
You fucking with me already.

164
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:50,861
Hey, Stevie Wonder!

165
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,157
We hungry.

166
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,492
Motherfucking Carl Lewis
or something.

167
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:04,617
I called the power company about
getting an extension on the light bill.

168
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,784
They say I gotta come down there,
stand in line.

169
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:10,090
I can't be standing in line
how they do down there,

170
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,361
not if I got Roger with me.

171
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,121
You know, D?

172
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,628
Man, it's Skinny goddamn Black,
you know...

173
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,965
Hey! There goes Skinny Black, man.

174
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:25,064
Hey, Lex. Lex, come here, baby!

175
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,812
Look right there, look at that.
That is Skinny Black, man.

176
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,208
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

177
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:36,113
- Ain't that some shit, huh?
- Who, you?

178
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,761
Yeah, me and Skinny gonna do us
some little catching up.

179
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,899
So am I supposed to piss myself
or something?

180
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,900
Okay, let's see who it is
that you know is somebody, huh?

181
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:51,435
Nobody in this here crib,
that's for damn sure.

182
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,645
- Where my baby, Roger, at?
- No, no, Lex, please!

183
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:56,942
I just put him to sleep, Lex!

184
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,792
Skinny used to DJ over at Booker T.
The same way I did at Westwood.

185
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,713
D, I know it's my job and all...

186
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,504
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit flow.

187
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,011
- But why she gotta wake Roger up?

188
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:07,318
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit some flow.

189
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,558
D, I need time for me too,
now.

190
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,987
Shit, I was just doing the same thing,
just over at my school.

191
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:16,045
Ask anybody, man. Go ask Carlos
on the corner, he'd tell you.

192
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,287
He was in my grade. Ask him.

193
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,425
We gotta get that extension, D.

194
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,477
Fuck. Paper money. Shit.

195
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:29,974
See, now, back in the day
you wouldn't even catch me

196
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,308
in this Bentley right here,
you'd catch me in a Crown Vic.

197
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,854
Bitch. Shit, back in the day,

198
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,618
- I was triple platinum. Ask anyone.
- D.

199
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:40,664
- I think I'll take a shower. Here.
- I don't give a fuck, man.

200
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,061
- I need you to watch Roger for me.
- Hey, give him to Shug!

201
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,876
Shug say it's her chill time.
Come on.

202
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,693
When is my chill time?

203
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:57,076
Come on, man. Hey. Hey.
Hey, man. No, no, man.

204
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,407
The bitch gotta go take a shower, man.
You relax your ass, man.

205
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:03,123
Come here. Come here, man.

206
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,524
Hey, man, you can't be
crying around like no bitch, man.

207
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,750
Hey. Hey, get rid
of them tears, man.

208
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,324
No. Cut them tears shit out, man.
Come on.

209
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:17,751
Come on. Come on.

210
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,284
Come on, come on. Here we go.
Here we go, man.

211
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:23,892
Come on, come on.
Let me try something.

212
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,794
All right, push that one.

213
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,532
Do that. What is this right here?

214
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,146
Hey, I like that, man. Do that again.

215
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,133
Listen to that, man.

216
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,128
Now, that shit buck, ain't it, man?
Do it again, man.

217
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,271
What the fuck you doing
with my boy?

218
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,197
- Come on, give him to me.
- We just playing.

219
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,376
- Give him to me.
- Come on...

220
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,813
- He don't need to be playing.
- That's what I'm talking about.

221
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,465
Every time he gets settled,
you gotta come fuck with him!

222
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,513
I'm telling you, you gonna
give that little boy a twitch!

223
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:30,209
Better go easy, girl.
Man can't be no open candy store.

224
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,772
We tight this whole week.

225
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:37,114
Put your shine on, man.
I hear this one coming.

226
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,524
What's happening with you, man?

227
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:45,060
Don't act scared, man,
she don't bite.

228
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,392
She just nibbles a little bit.

229
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:52,509
Come on... Hey, hey. Damn.

230
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,908
Why can't I work the motels
anymore, D? At least they got air.

231
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,046
At least they take a cut
is what they do.

232
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,571
Thirty dollars an hour
on top of what we already charging,

233
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,101
for what, a five-minute nut?

234
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,051
Taking money out of my pocket
trying to keep

235
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,492
your little country ass cool.

236
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:08,232
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

237
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,948
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

238
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,120
- He's coming back.
- I'm all wet and sticky.

239
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,914
You gonna have to put a show on
for this one.

240
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:18,245
Do that little shit you do
with your tongue.

241
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,903
Now, come on, he's coming back.
Get your mind right, okay?

242
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,848
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Fuck.

243
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:25,990
Fuck, man!

244
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,837
How come Lex gets to work
out of that strip club, and I can't?

245
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:31,041
Because we done been over this
ten times, Nola.

246
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:32,900
You got what they call
a bad equilibrium.

247
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,783
And it ain't your fault,
you just knock into shit.

248
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,986
I put you on that stage
in them heels,

249
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,398
tricks gonna be yelling, "Timber."

250
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:42,912
I'm in heels out here every day.
You don't see me fall down once...

251
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:47,076
Because you sitting, Nola.
Ain't that much of a fall to the floor.

252
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,762
Lookit, why don't you just let me do
the thinking for you, okay?

253
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:53,444
You do what you do,
and you let me do what I do.

254
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,428
One day, you'll have to tell me
about that.

255
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,279
About what?

256
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:00,938
What the fuck it is you do.

257
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,739
What did you just say to me?

258
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:11,403
Hi, honey.

259
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:16,292
Wanna see me walk in these heels
all the way to your lap?

260
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,181
I'll be right there.

261
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,930
Looks like he got air in his car, D.

262
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,775
Must be working hard as you.

263
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,144
Fuck you doing, man?
Doing my job? I got a mop for you.

264
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,447
Elroy, I'm having me a day
that won't quit,

265
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:22,421
so I'll need you to shed
just a little light on me, okay?

266
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,464
You got something for me?

267
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:28,754
Yeah. I got a grocery list for you too.
I need a...

268
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,056
A brick of that Big Easy bud.

269
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,124
What the fuck is this, man?

270
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:37,142
Got your stank all over this.
I don't even like my own sweat, D.

271
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,676
What the fuck is this?

272
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:43,505
Okay. Let's do it this way, then.

273
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,154
Let's give it some
of my sweet juices on it...

274
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,318
...and tell me you ain't
gonna take that.

275
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,822
You better watch yourself, D.

276
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,954
Let me get you on your way.

277
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,927
You cool yet?

278
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,658
You still into that shit, man?

279
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,269
I remember Coach Rosallis
used to let you flow

280
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,409
over the intercom in gym class,

281
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:26,427
back when we used to beatbox
like the Fat Boys, remember that?

282
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,039
Dude, man,
we went to East Middle together.

283
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:32,244
Clyde. Called me Key.

284
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,746
- Nigga, what's up, man?
- How you feeling, man?

285
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,876
Yeah, you used to spin them
little records at the after-school joints.

286
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,761
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I was
scratching or nothing like that.

287
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,806
I just made sure "Purple Rain"
got played for the ladies, that's all.

288
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,846
- Let me get these batteries, man.
- "Purple Rain."

289
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,478
Hey, give over, man. He cool. He cool.

290
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,719
East Middle, man.
Them was the days, man.

291
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,122
- Yeah, man.
- Them was the days.

292
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,556
I see you still doing the same.

293
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,434
Oh, yeah, you know,
like the post office:

294
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,186
- Through rain, sleet or snow.
- You looking good, though, man.

295
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:07,548
So, what, you got you
a dildo or something?

296
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,790
A do-what?

297
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,406
I mean, what's all the batteries for?

298
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,966
It ain't for no dildo,
I'll tell you that right now.

299
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,470
- I'm just fucking with you, man.
- Okay, okay.

300
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,705
They for my microphones, man.

301
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,077
- Microphones?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,415
So, what do you do?

303
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:44,160
I told Jesus

304
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:48,961
It would be all right

305
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:53,499
If he changed my name

306
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:03,807
I told Jesus

307
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:08,763
It would be all right

308
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:13,244
If he changed my name

309
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:22,950
I told Jesus

310
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:28,000
It would be all right

311
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,278
If he changed

312
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:40,260
My name

313
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,250
- Jesus told me
- Jesus

314
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:02,437
That the world would be against me

315
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:10,275
- If he changed
- Changed my

316
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:15,692
My

317
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:24,039
Name

318
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,476
Hey, Shug. Shug.

319
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,493
Wake up.

320
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,755
What, I gotta watch the baby?

321
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:46,057
No, everybody asleep.

322
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:54,182
- So he kicking now, huh?
- Usually after I eat.

323
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,288
He real active
during the day, though.

324
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:01,002
He must get that after his daddy.
He sure don't get that from me.

325
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,439
Whoever that is, huh?

326
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:10,639
You know, Shug,

327
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,427
I mean, you been tricking for me

328
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:21,739
And me not pimping you

329
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,915
...your demonstration,

330
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:26,417
it just puts us in a whole...

331
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,453
...different kind of place,
you know what I mean?

332
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,173
You want me to leave.

333
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,172
Hell, no.

334
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,280
Why would you say
something like that?

335
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,655
I just feel like...

336
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,333
Like I'm having one of them
midlife crisis, you know?

337
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,836
I mean, my daddy...

338
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,931
...you know, his heart
gave out on him when he was, like...

339
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:07,057
Well, shit, when I was 12 years old.

340
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,882
Shit, he was my age.

341
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:10,797
And that shit just been...

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,067
Just been fucking
with my mind, you know?

343
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,785
It got me feeling
like this is it for me.

344
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,403
I just don't know what
I'm supposed... Supposed to do.

345
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,738
I get bad dreams.

346
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:35,097
Dreams like me giving birth
to dead dogs.

347
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,120
Sometimes I'm breast-feeding
a big old ugly catfish.

348
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:42,452
- For real?
- Yeah.

349
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:46,613
But that's just my mind

350
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:50,041
touching in on something
I ain't said yet.

351
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,755
What's that?

352
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:01,884
I'm scared, D.

353
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,382
Sometimes I just get so scared...

354
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:20,342
Most gracious and heavenly Father,
we pray that you

355
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,293
bless this food and this house
in Jesus' name. Amen.

356
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,661
Amen.

357
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,190
So Beth Ann tells me

358
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,905
the reason I didn't
get that sales-supervisor position

359
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,013
is because she says I have issues

360
00:24:33,216 --> 00:24:35,900
enforcing company policy
with my coworkers,

361
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:38,136
who, by the way,
she referred to as my friends.

362
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:40,640
Not "coworkers," mind you,
but "friends."

363
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,006
And I said to her,
"Hey, just because I am pleasant

364
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:45,984
and supportive does not mean
that I cannot crack a whip."

365
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,607
Because, you know,
I can crack a whip.

366
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,400
Yeah, you can, baby.

367
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,090
Because what we talking about here,
huh? Folding some sweaters?

368
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,679
Shoot, sales supervisors
don't even handle the safe.

369
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:58,265
So I go in and I talk to Leonard.
Because he always talking about,

370
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,441
"Come in and air your grievances,"
right? So I did.

371
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,466
- What did he say?
- You know what he says to me?

372
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,271
He says I am incapable of writing
somebody up because I'm so friendly.

373
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:09,600
And I said,
"Hey, give me a pen, Leonard, okay?

374
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:12,033
I'll tell you everything
that everybody's doing wrong."

375
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:15,491
What, Beth Ann, she take
way too long on her lunch break.

376
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:19,776
Alan, that little shit down in Receiving
came to work the other day high.

377
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:23,421
And Sally, just yesterday, came in with
this skirt with the discontinued line.

378
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,110
Remember that, baby?
Remember that little skirt I had?

379
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,197
And I know she didn't pay for it.

380
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,707
He think I'm gonna take some kind of
blind eye to all of these violations

381
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:35,259
if I was sales supervisor
just because I'm nice?

382
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:39,712
Clyde?

383
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,703
- Damn.
- What the hell you doing here, Djay?

384
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:57,411
Hey, look here, baby. I know you about
sick and tired of seeing me right now,

385
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:01,221
- but I just wanted to be able...
- Clyde. Who is it?

386
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,831
- It's just...
- Just an old school buddy, ma'am.

387
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,579
- From back in the day.
- Well, we was just having dinner.

388
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:15,593
I'm so sorry, y'all. And I'd have
left them in the car,

389
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,510
but this one right here, man,
she just

390
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:20,096
sniff out an air-conditioning unit
like an old bloodhound bitch.

391
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,332
Hey. Hey, man, respect my house.

392
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,605
Look, man, anyplace you and me

393
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:28,455
could just sit down
and talk for a minute?

394
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,594
Djay, things don't always
come together

395
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,318
just because you want them to,
all right, man?

396
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,688
Look, just because you got the bacon,
the lettuce and tomato,

397
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,016
hell, man, that don't mean
I'm gonna give you my toast.

398
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,802
Look, man, I know you done learned
a whole mess of shit

399
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,201
hustling out on the street, right?

400
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,077
Let me tell you what I learned
while working on my job.

401
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,701
- Thank you.
- There are two types of people:

402
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:53,285
Those that talk the talk
and those that walk the walk.

403
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,448
People who walk the walk,
they sometimes talk the talk.

404
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:00,778
But most of the time, they don't
talk at all, because they walking.

405
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,258
Now, people who talk the talk,
when it comes time for them to walk,

406
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,790
- you wanna know what they do?
- What is that?

407
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:09,894
They talk people like me
into walking for them.

408
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,399
Look, I'm just asking you...

409
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,943
Just listen to what I got here,
man, all right? Just listen to it.

410
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:21,513
And if you ain't... If you ain't feeling it,
man, I'm out your life, okay?

411
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:33,354
So can I get y'all anything?

412
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:36,555
No, ma'am.

413
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:40,497
Hey, I really like your hair.

414
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:43,698
It's got some, like,
chocolate colors in it.

415
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,865
Oh, thank you.

416
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,456
I have this great guy that does it
over in Germantown,

417
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,384
the coloring.

418
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,555
- That sound all right.
- The whole time it's gonna have

419
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:53,967
this thing going like:

420
00:27:57,397 --> 00:27:59,339
- Then I come in...
- When you gonna start a rhyme?

421
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:02,770
Just gotta get my mode on, man,
just give me a second. All right.

422
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:06,675
These bitches pop it for some paper
Pop that ass for some cash flow

423
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,902
Do it like I like it
And I give you what you ask for

424
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:11,664
I try and do my hair
every couple of months

425
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:14,284
because it keeps the tricks guessing.

426
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,560
- You know?
- I'm sorry, keep the what?

427
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,151
Well, my hair has to be redone a lot

428
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:22,421
because these ain't me real braids,
these just extensions.

429
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:26,445
Nola, would you just
shut the fuck up, please?

430
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,996
What makes you think this lady
care about your kitchen-ass hairdo?

431
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,235
I think, you know what, it's nice.
It's okay...

432
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:36,782
Lady, you don't got to be nice to her
because she's sitting on your couch.

433
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:40,728
You think her hair look like a wet
dust mop, go on and tell her so. I do.

434
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:43,605
- Damn, Lex.
- Well, I didn't. I mean, I don't.

435
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,395
Lex, why you gotta be so ugly?

436
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,797
Get a nigga minx
Grab her by the hand

437
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:51,028
Take her back for some convo
Drop a couple grams

438
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:53,082
Now you're back at the condo

439
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,730
- Ugly as a swamp-duck ho.
- God!

440
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,971
Everybody else
says my hair looks sexy.

441
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,339
And then they nut.

442
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:04,081
Clyde?

443
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,097
Clyde?

444
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,853
Real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

445
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:12,052
Put your hands on your knees
Shake it, shake it real fast

446
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,548
Shake it, shake it real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

447
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:18,131
- What's up, nigga, you run out of spit?
- No, man, I just...

448
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,707
Clyde!

449
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,890
What are you doing?

450
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:30,708
Walking.

451
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:45,914
I see you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

452
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,374
See you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

453
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:53,528
Working on your flex
Figure what? Nigga, fuck that shit

454
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,982
Let's get this to work, Djay.

455
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,767
The roadblock

456
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:20,160
Got niggas jumpin' up
Tryin' to move the rock

457
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:24,349
It's like all my days, I've been
hearing this beat in my head, man,

458
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,653
like a pounding.
I mean, sometimes it's real raw,

459
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:30,300
like a eightball joint, but then
sometimes, man, it get real soft,

460
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,223
like Otis Redding and shit, man.

461
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,242
And this beat, this pounding, man,

462
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:39,325
that's what I been calling my mode,
this feeling. And, Key, if my mode

463
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:42,176
is cracking, man,
it's like I can't be stopped, man.

464
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,762
It's like I'm Mike, and it's showtime.

465
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,301
Nigga, it's on, you know what I mean?
You know?

466
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,185
Because, shit, when I'm out here
on this track,

467
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,356
I gotta keep my game tight, man.

468
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,874
Because it's hard out here
for a pimp, man. For real, man.

469
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,951
Hold on, I like that, man.

470
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,063
"It's hard out here for a pimp."

471
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:06,499
Hot 107. 1. Big up to South Memphis
out there, checking in.

472
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:08,584
I got your requests, and I got
that coming up for you.

473
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Keep your radios locked.

474
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,031
This is messing with my mode.

475
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:17,027
This is a bunch of bullshit, man.

476
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:21,414
This is all I got
So I keeps it hot

477
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:25,538
How I'm supposed to not?
Read your post to plot

478
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:27,909
"Read your post to plot."

479
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:37,670
Baby, this is some hard shit
right here.

480
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:40,867
Trying to take what's
in your head, man,

481
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,548
and put it into words that fit together
like a puzzle.

482
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,506
So, you know...

483
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,667
I wish there was something
I could do.

484
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,169
You know, just...

485
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:56,104
Shit, baby, you my whole operation.

486
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:59,558
You might be what they call a...

487
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:03,107
Like, a primary investor, you know?

488
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:06,724
Making this shit happen
one trick at a time.

489
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,376
- Hey, Nola.
- What?

490
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,973
Remember when I first met you?

491
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,053
Right where I found you at?
Remember, you was at the truck stop?

492
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:25,864
Smallest little lot lizard I'd ever seen,
tricking them truckers for change.

493
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:29,609
But you had balls, man.
Big gorilla balls.

494
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:33,040
I got love for you, Nola.

495
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:35,984
Big love.

496
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,846
And I ain't talking about a way a man
love a woman or nothing like that.

497
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:42,831
I'm talking about like a brother.

498
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,838
Hey, do me a favor.

499
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:48,620
I want you to put your hands
right here. Both of them.

500
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,198
Now, I'm gonna put
my hands here too.

501
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,664
Know what this means?

502
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:01,868
What?

503
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,465
It means we in charge.

504
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:09,933
It means we got our hands
on the wheel. We in charge.

505
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,947
Not them tricks out there, man.

506
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,147
We in charge.

507
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,609
I wanna hear you say it...

508
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:22,355
...so I can believe in you
the same way you believe in me.

509
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,187
We in charge.

510
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:30,571
That's the best you can do?
Say it like you mean it.

511
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,744
We in charge.

512
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,083
You said you was all right with this.

513
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:38,577
It's what you wanna hear, right?
So let's just drop it.

514
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,262
No, Yevette.
I wanna hear what you really think.

515
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,602
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

516
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,912
You say that,

517
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:47,633
but I know you wanna hear what you
want, so that's what I'm gonna say.

518
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:50,037
I'm sick and tired of people telling me
what I'm thinking,

519
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:51,606
like I don't know my
own goddamned mind.

520
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,710
Don't you dare take that tone
with me, Clyde, okay?

521
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:56,334
- I have supported you in everything...
- We already discussed this!

522
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,090
All right, fine! I'm thrilled!
Okay? Thrilled.

523
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,329
What woman wouldn't want
her husband spending all his time

524
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,700
in a house full of ho's?

525
00:34:12,187 --> 00:34:14,358
What's all this shit again?

526
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,901
Drink holders.
Poor man's soundproofing.

527
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,616
So you ain't so dumb, huh?

528
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,042
- D?
- What?

529
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:28,723
There's someone at the door for you.

530
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:30,932
Well, shit, baby, you know my rates.

531
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:35,865
- I don't think he want no weed.
- Then wake Nola's ass up.

532
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,160
- I don't think he want that either.
- Shit, man.

533
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,592
We have to come up with some
fucking rules in this house!

534
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,440
- Well, if you just tell me not to
- I wanna put a red light bulb up there

535
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:47,004
- answer the door, that's fine with me.
- To say I'm working.

536
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:49,052
- It ain't for me!
- Every time I'm fucking working,

537
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:51,287
y'all come and bothering me.

538
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:53,242
Hey, man.

539
00:34:57,214 --> 00:35:00,085
You Mormons is some
brave motherfuckers.

540
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,902
No, I'm Shelby.

541
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,307
Okay, you Shelby.

542
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:08,085
All right, look.
Hey, turntable's set up,

543
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,103
and the mixer that D got
has room for four inputs.

544
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:14,198
- Cool. You got a power strip?
- Oh, we tight.

545
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:16,157
How many outlets you need?

546
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,094
- Three. I brought my MPC.
- Smart move.

547
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:21,980
Hey, Key.

548
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:25,402
Let me holler at you
for a second, man.

549
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,823
- What's up, man?
- Who the fuck is this nigga, man?

550
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:32,090
That's Shelby. He play piano
down in my church.

551
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,153
You know, I figure we bring him in,
help him develop our sound.

552
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,611
You know he white, right?

553
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:43,006
No, he just light-skinned.

554
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,837
Yo, peep. I got this shit right here
that...

555
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:54,201
I keep this notepad
so that I can just jot down some shit.

556
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,545
It's something...

557
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,613
Get the fuck out of here, man.

558
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:06,206
It go like this, man.

559
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:09,380
Y'all sure y'all don't wanna, like,
burn one first, man?

560
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:13,917
No, man. We can toke up later.
Let's hear what you got.

561
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:17,541
Fine, man. I got...

562
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:19,931
Okay.

563
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:26,246
I bet you won't beat that bitch
Whoop that bitch

564
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:30,335
Got me acting buck and shit
Ho's telling me to calm down

565
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,680
But I'm like, "Fuck that shit"

566
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:35,262
I'm already on that Hpnotiq
And that Grey Goose

567
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:38,247
A couple of shots of Hen
That just gave me a...

568
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:40,067
What the fuck wrong?
You don't like that shit?

569
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,687
- No, D, look.
- I got other shit, man.

570
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:46,403
- No, look... It's okay, man.
- I think that's tight.

571
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,838
It's just that we want radio play, right?

572
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,270
You got a song called
"Beat That Bitch,"

573
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:53,189
they might hear that
and think that's degrading.

574
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:55,011
But that's if you're calling
a woman a bitch.

575
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,935
This sounds like a
tearing-the-club-up song.

576
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,822
Man, I ain't trying to call no ho
no bitch.

577
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:01,223
Yeah, I mean, besides,
most of the bitches I know are guys.

578
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,208
Look, man, y'all preaching to the choir,
all right?

579
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,957
If you had to say something different,
other than "beat that bitch,"

580
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:07,432
what would you say?

581
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,976
I don't know. Shit. Stuff like...

582
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,572
"Stomp that ho."

583
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,331
- Who gonna play that?
- Fuck.

584
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:18,819
- Shit, "whoop that trick."
- No, no, no.

585
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,004
- Go back.
- What?

586
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,830
- "Whoop that trick."
- That's it.

587
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,513
- Like what?
- Like a chant, man.

588
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,597
- Whoop that trick
- Whoop that trick?

589
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,034

00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,889

00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,731
Oh, shit, man, yeah.

Get 'em
Whoop that trick

596
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,541

Whoop that trick

Come on, Shel, find it, man. Find it.

600
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,774
Speed it up. Speed it up.

601
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:00,777
There you go.

602
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,425
I like that clap.

603
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:22,027
Not bad to be light-skinned, huh?

604
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,854
- Whoop that trick
- Get 'em

605
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:37,296
- Whoop that trick

606
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:38,801

609
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:43,570

611
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:46,475
- Whoop that trick

I'ma make these suckers

00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,846
If you violate off the top
Trick, you gotta go

00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:55,948
I done held in a lot of shit
And I'm 'bout to flip

Born and raised in the M

Before it's said and done
You bitches gonna remember me

Okay, let's go smoke that joint.

645
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,510
It's nice to have company, huh?

646
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,385
Thank you.

647
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:40,635
See, the thing is...

648
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:45,271
And I believe this, man... . Rap is
coming back home to the South.

649
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:46,815
- Yeah, man.
- Because this, man...

650
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,833
This is where it all began.

651
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:53,053
Heavy percussion, repetitive hooks,
sexually suggestive lyrics.

652
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,520
Man, it's all blues, brother.

653
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:57,853
"Back Door Man" to
"Back That Ass Up."

654
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,142
It's all about pain and...
And pussy.

655
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,470
Sorry, baby. And making music, man.

656
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:09,021
With simple tools,
by any means necessary.

657
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,410
You've got to get what you got to say
out because you got to.

658
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,262
Every man, you know
what I'm saying?

659
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:21,058
Every man has the right,
the goddamn right...

660
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,126
...to contribute a verse.

661
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:29,603
- Number one for hip-hop. This
your man Boogaloo in the house.

662
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,075
North Memphis,
throw your thumbs up.

663
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,732
South Memphis,
let's get ready to kick it.

664
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,724
I got this hot joint from my man,
Al Kapone.

665
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:36,347
"Get Crunk, Get Buck." It's hot.

666
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:12,896
- Do you just do music?
- Hey, man.

667
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:18,080
Do you got, like, a regular kind of job,
a day job?

668
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:21,065
Yeah, I got a job.
I restock vending machines.

669
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:22,436
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

670
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:25,668
soda, candy, microwave popcorn.
All that shit.

671
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,623
- That's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

672
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,314
- Why?
- Because

673
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:32,101
I gotta get up every day
at the crack

674
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,505
and head out to all the truck stops
on the interstate

675
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:36,227
before I head to the high schools.

676
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,283
Yeah, I'm alone all day,

677
00:42:38,477 --> 00:42:42,918
and I smell like...
Like sticky buns and Skittles.

678
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,921
I thought my job sucked, but...

679
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:54,989
Hey, man.

680
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:58,732
So this Skinny Black shit, that's real?

681
00:42:59,406 --> 00:43:01,828
Look, man, because even if he
does listen to what we got, man,

682
00:43:02,032 --> 00:43:04,300
we still don't know what he gonna do,
you know what I mean?

683
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:06,254
It's a one-in-a-million shot, D.

684
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:11,019
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this motherfucking Chevy,

685
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,525
I can pimp Skinny.

686
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:15,599
Nigga, you just get me
where I gotta be at.

687
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm telling you, this dog got him
some tricks, man.

688
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:22,064
- You mean "old dog," right?
- I didn't mean it like that, man.

689
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:29,547
My wife, man, she a...

690
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,271
She a good woman.

691
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,206
She feeds me.

692
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,084
She get freaky on my birthday.

693
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:42,288
- What she do?
- None of your business.

694
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:45,298
But sometimes I feel, man, like...

695
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:50,546
Like I talked such a good game
when we was young, man,

696
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,056
about my own studio
and my own label that...

697
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,411
Shit, Djay,
now I'm just paying rent, man.

698
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:05,197
This shit right here, it gotta work.

699
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,612
It gotta work, man,
because it ain't over for me.

700
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:27,056
I am so sick and tired of you trying
to tell me what to do with my boy.

701
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,415
That's my son! You go on and
have your little baby, then you can do

702
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,175
- whatever you want!
- Lex, stop yelling.

703
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:36,053
My pussy paid for this.
I should be mad.

704
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:40,342
Lookie, lookie, who just decided
to waltz on in.

705
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:42,807
Where the hell you been at, Djay?

706
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,652
You know, I been standing outside
three hours.

707
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,184
Finally just went on ahead,
took myself a taxi ride.

708
00:44:48,378 --> 00:44:49,522
Spent up all my little monies.

709
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,983
So I really hope you ain't expecting
shit from me today!

710
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:58,260
- Right back to your toys.
- You should go.

711
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,914
You know what, Djay?

712
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,793
You ain't never gonna be nothing more
than what you is right now,

713
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:07,224
and that's my motherfucking
chauffeur.

714
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,903
I make the money up in here.

715
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,139
Know what? Matter of fact,
I think I feel like

716
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,413
making me some money right now.

717
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:20,347
Feel like popping my pussy,
maybe shaking my ass.

718
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:24,692
Go on, boy. Go on, get my car for me.

719
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:27,926
You heard me. Go on, now, little bitch.

720
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:31,606
- What the fuck you just say to me?
- That's right, keep...

721
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:35,287
- What the fuck you call me?
- Called you a motherfucking bitch!

722
00:45:35,486 --> 00:45:38,748
Now, do something about it, damn it!
Do something!

723
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,684
You and me...

724
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,946
...we done, okay?

725
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:52,730
We done.

726
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,003
You know what?

727
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:58,810
We been done.

728
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:04,059
And there you go,
running off to your little toys.

729
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:06,712
Because you ain't nothing
but a little punk-ass bitch!

730
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:10,711
- Lex, please back off.
- Just shut the fuck up!

731
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:14,744
Wasted five years of my damn life
working in this piece-of-shit hole.

732
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:17,051
So, what now? That's my shit!

733
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,257
What, you just gonna
throw my stuff out?

734
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:24,346
Oh, out the door! Hey, Djay!
You just leave my shit alone!

735
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:28,093
I paid for that...
No! No! No!

736
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:30,397
- I paid for this shit!
- Fuck! Come here.

737
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:32,250
- Now!
- Djay, no!

738
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:37,148
- Get the fuck off me! Get off me!
- No! No! Djay, no!

739
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,264
Talk now!

740
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,199
- Hey. Hey, come here.
- No, please, D.

741
00:46:43,397 --> 00:46:45,950
Let go. Let go.

742
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,503
Come on. Come on.

743
00:46:54,823 --> 00:46:57,375
Where in the fuck do you
expect me to go?

744
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:02,562
You can go to hell, all I give a fuck.

745
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:22,469
Y'all make him pay!

746
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:40,649
All right, man.
This is what I got so far.

747
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,067
Man, it seems like I'm duckin'
Dodgin' bullets every day

748
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:48,080
Niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I got ho's on the blade

749
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,924
But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

750
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:53,708
Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

751
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:56,624
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

752
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,502
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

753
00:48:59,698 --> 00:49:02,546
These gals take me through things
Leave a big headache

754
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:04,811
I'm hopin' every night
They don't end up being dead weight

755
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:09,484
Hold on. Hold on, one second.
My bad.

756
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:11,276
Baby.

757
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:13,996
Look, I'm in a session right now,
all right?

758
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:17,011
- What time you coming home?
- I can't give you that time.

759
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,961
If I give it to you,
you're gonna hold me to that.

760
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:22,452
- I don't see why you can't give a time.
- Because I'm not gonna do it.

761
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:25,648
L... Look...

762
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:29,141
If you just let me talk, I can be able
to tell you that I can't do it...

763
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:31,821
Because I said so, that's why!

764
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:36,724
You ready to work, lover-boy?

765
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:45,838
Hey, Shelby,
bring that beat back, man.

766
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:47,697
From the top.

767
00:49:48,631 --> 00:49:49,875
You know what? Just kill it.

768
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,211
Fuck, man.
I got this flow I need to spit.

769
00:49:52,408 --> 00:49:54,316
Look, look, Djay.

770
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,111
Now, we gonna have to make
a choice, man.

771
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:58,647
Either we just gonna lay down
some freestyle freefall,

772
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,270
or we gonna lay down a track.

773
00:50:00,473 --> 00:50:02,481
You know, something that's gonna
get us some radio play.

774
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,655
I thought that's what we was doing
right here.

775
00:50:04,857 --> 00:50:07,126
No, no, no. What we doing
is a whole bunch of flow.

776
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:10,223
That's all we doing.
And it just go on and on and on.

777
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,505
Man, the shit don't ever stop.

778
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:13,745
Yeah, D, what he's saying is that
we ain't got a hook.

779
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:15,920
Well, shit, give it some hook, then!

780
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,748
I mean, fuck, you the producer, man.

781
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:20,434
You just tell me what
you want me to do, then.

782
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:24,149
We need to lay down something,
Djay. Anything. Even if it's shit.

783
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:28,854
And I keep telling you, I ain't putting
no shit on top of no shit, man.

784
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:30,939
I ain't trying to sell no cash shit here.

785
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:35,704
Well, that's the wonder of audiotape,
Djay. We can just record over shit.

786
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,901
Go on, bring it back up, Shel.

787
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:42,008
- Go on, bring it up!
- You need some ass, nigga?

788
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,831
- What?
- Because I got a room full of pussy

789
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:45,818
right in there for you.

790
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:48,983
- Fuck you, Djay.
- Oh, fuck me?

791
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:51,353
- Yeah, fuck you.
- No, no, fuck Yevette, man.

792
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,233
Because she the one got your ass
wound up like a motherfucking clock.

793
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,607
Look here, you dirt-rascal pimp,

794
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,629
you keep my wife's name out
your mouth, you hear me?

795
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,474
- Hey, guys, come on, keep it light.
- Sound like your wife,

796
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,940
she the one need to put something
in her motherfucking mouth.

797
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:04,826
- You know what I'm saying?
- Fuck you say, man?

798
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,096
- You heard me, nigga!
- What the fuck you say, man?

799
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:09,150
- That's what!
- Stop it, man! Sit down!

800
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:10,805
- What?! What?!
- What's up, man?!

801
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:13,048
Can you please stop it?
Do we have to do this?

802
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:16,662
Can't we just smoke a joint,
for chrissake?!

803
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:19,899
- Who is it?
- It's me, Shug.

804
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:24,221
- Look, bitch, we working right now!
- I got something for you.

805
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:33,018
Come on, man.

806
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:35,741
Sorry to interrupt y'all's
recording session,

807
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:38,654
but they had this interview
with Skinny Black on TV

808
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:44,383
and look like he had one of these
in his studio where he uses,

809
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,776
so I thought I'd go out
and buy you one.

810
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,332
Y'all have fun.

811
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:11,459
That's a bottom bitch for you.

812
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:15,009
I mean, we got everything we need
right here.

813
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:17,409
And all this stuff in this...

814
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,723
This little-bitty space, man,
it just looks so much bigger now.

815
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:33,375
I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar
out of a dime,

816
00:52:33,576 --> 00:52:36,194
and I ain't even got a cent, man.

817
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:39,844
It takes time, Djay.

818
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,838
Do y'all believe in omens?

819
00:52:56,906 --> 00:52:59,972
Okay, Shug, put your headphones on.

820
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:02,434
- Move closer to the mike.
- Okay.

821
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:03,944
Can you hear yourself?

822
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:08,128
- Say something.
- Hello. Oh, yeah.

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,150
Okay, Shug,

824
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:12,682
what we need right now
is called a "hook."

825
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,785
That's like the chorus of the song.

826
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:18,665
Now, you're gonna be singing
what's on Djay's pad. Djay.

827
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:25,738
All right, now.

828
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:28,072
"You know it's hard out here

829
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,342

for the rent.

830

"Jumping ship." Okay.

Now, Shug, I got an idea
how this should go.

834
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:43,594
Now, I suck,

835
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,179
but, I'm gonna sing it with you
until you get it down, all right?

836
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:47,660
Okay.

837

Will cause a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

841
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:04,296
- Okay, sing with me.

00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:29,546
Okay, here we go.

- You didn't fuck up. Just go.

884
00:56:20,415 --> 00:56:22,040
Hey, Shelby, close the door.
We need to work.

885
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,555
This is my motherfucking house, man.

886
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,475
Ain't that some shit?

887
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,615
Come on, fuck all that, man.

888
00:56:50,817 --> 00:56:52,279
You're on, dog.

889
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,921
All right, D.
We about to lay you down now, man.

890
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:02,945
That means we got
a fixed length, right?

891
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:05,724
So that means don't say no more
than what you got on that pad.

892
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,752
- I got you, man.
- Nola, kill the fan.

893
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,945
Hold on, hold on.

894
00:57:20,324 --> 00:57:23,227
Shelby, you hear that?

895
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:25,728

897
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:37,185
Goddamn.

898
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:41,955
This day is really starting to fuck

899
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:45,793
Hey, man, R.L. Over here?

900
00:57:57,736 --> 00:58:00,388
R.L., look, man, I'm sorry
to disturb you and all.

00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,879
And I know you and me,

902
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:06,277
we done had words in the past and
some of them weren't too friendly.

903
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:08,743
But right now, man, I got some shit
taking place in my crib

904
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:12,450
that just requires a little bit of
silence. You know what I mean?

905
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:17,123
Now, I'd never demand of you,
I can only request...

906
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:23,144
...with a gesture of neighborly
friendliness, you know what I mean,

907
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:28,390
that you please, please consider
the mute button just for a spell, man.

908
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:33,826
All right, man.

909
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:40,681
- Stand by, everybody.
- Standing by.

910
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,199
I'm standing by.

911
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,363
You know it's hard out here

00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:23,307
With my eyes, I done seen
Some crazy things in the street

920
00:59:23,503 --> 00:59:26,123
Got a couple ho's working
On the changes for me

921
00:59:26,322 --> 00:59:29,071
But I gotta keep my game tight
Like Kobe on game night

922
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,015

No better, I know that ain't right

Done seen people killed
Done seen people deal

924
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:37,612
Done seen people live in poverty
With no meals

925
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,526
It's fucked up where I live
But this is how it is

926
00:59:40,722 --> 00:59:43,505
It might be new to you
But it's been like this for years

But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

950

Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

951
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:32,018
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

952
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,899
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

953
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:36,590
Man, these girls take me
Through things

954
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,134
Leave a big headache

955
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:41,012
I'm hoping every night
They don't end up being dead weight

956
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:43,630
I got a snow bunny
And a black girl too

957
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,418
You pay the right price
And they'll both do you

958
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:49,302
That's the way the game goes
Gotta keep it strictly pimpin'

Gotta have my hustle tight
Makin' change off these women, yeah

Wait, man.
I got another verse, man!

977
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:25,075
Djay, we need to talk, man.

978
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:27,828
Look, I just want it to be perfect.
And this mike,

01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:30,332
it ain't shit.

980
01:01:30,526 --> 01:01:32,763
What the fuck wrong with it?
That shit record, don't it?

981
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:38,326
Djay, the mikes we using, they got
a wider pattern, D. They go flat.

982
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:41,657
So when you start screaming,
man, they just distort and pop out.

983
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:44,092
Man, nigga, I don't know shit
about none of that shit!

984
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,195
All I know is that shit
in there was live, man!

985
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:48,155
And every time I get
my motherfucking mode up,

986
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:49,878
- you come and fuck with it!
- It ain't me.

987
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,934
That shit, it ain't gonna
be live like that again.

988
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:53,502
I don't give a fuck what mike I'm on!

989
01:01:53,696 --> 01:01:57,558
Djay, that shit was live in there,

990
01:01:57,792 --> 01:02:00,313
but it was also distorted, man.

991
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:02,902
God!

992
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:06,399
I just don't understand why
I gotta pay so much more money

993
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:08,086
for that microphone right there

994
01:02:08,288 --> 01:02:13,340
when the one right next to it
look just like it but cost half, man.

995
01:02:13,538 --> 01:02:14,716
Let's do it this way, man.

996
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:18,329
If I buy two of them, say you give
them to me both for $90.

997
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:22,142
This is studio quality. It costs $250.

998
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,727
Now, why would I sell you
two of them for $90 apiece?

999
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,305
Just because of that statement, man,

1000
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:28,441
"The customer's always right,"
ain't you heard?

1001
01:02:28,643 --> 01:02:30,748
Not in this case, sir, no.

1002
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,566
If you want quality,
you have to pay for it.

1003
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:37,954
Look, man, can't you cut me some
type of break on this stuff here?

1004
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,740
What was that?

1005
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:49,087
- What?
- I mean, what you looking at, man?

1006
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:52,025
- Nothing.
- Don't worry, Sparky, man.

1007
01:02:52,229 --> 01:02:54,751
I ain't gonna pop or nothing like that.

1008
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:58,940
Look here, man.

1009
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:02,787
The thing is, that gal over there, right?

1010
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:05,219
I got it in real good with her.

1011
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,488
I mean, she's my gal and all,

1012
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:11,615
but she don't necessarily
belong to me.

1013
01:03:13,383 --> 01:03:14,692
You see, a gal like that, man,

1014
01:03:14,886 --> 01:03:19,231
she the type of girl that wanna
shut them doors, lock them,

1015
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:22,979
see what type of specials
you got going on in the back.

1016
01:03:23,784 --> 01:03:27,013
And me, I'm the kind of man that

1017
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:29,446
just walk out of here and
leave a girl like that behind

1018
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:34,660
because, like I say, she with me
and all, but she don't belong to me.

1019
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,745
Not necessarily.

1020
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:39,648
And maybe when she leaves...

1021
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:43,977
...she can take something that don't
necessarily belong to her neither.

1022
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:48,713
It's like you say, man, you want
quality, you got to pay for that.

1023
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,493
Hey, gal.

1024
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:03,400
I need that microphone.

1025
01:04:04,076 --> 01:04:05,004
Okay.

1026
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,270
I need you to go back there
and be friendly with him

1027
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:10,022
and bring that microphone
out with you, okay?

1028
01:04:10,924 --> 01:04:13,064
No. No way.

1029
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:16,490
Nola, I need that microphone.

1030
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:18,279
Get it.

1031
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,583
Y'all be good, now.

1032
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:45,926
Hey.

1033
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:55,953
Hey.

1034
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:58,929
- Don't ever do that to me again, D.
- What? I ain't...

1035
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:02,254
No, I ain't some fucking cash machine,
where you can get shit for free.

1036
01:05:02,451 --> 01:05:04,012
Ain't like you was
in there sweating bullets.

1037
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:06,632
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- You was in there for a minute.

1038
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:09,705
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- Look, man, I was gonna give...

1039
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,794
I'm not gonna suck dick
every time you come up short!

1040
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:12,969
You got something for me.

1041
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:15,212
- Do you got something for me?!
- Fuck you, D.

1042
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,379
- Here, take it! You earned it!
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

1043
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,483
This is expensive motherfucking...
Hey, Nola, bring your ass...

1044
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:25,679
- I'm fucking out of here. I don't care.
- Nola! Don't you do this shit right now!

1045
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:28,879
Nola! Bring your ass here, man!

1046
01:05:29,237 --> 01:05:31,442
Don't you ever walk away from me!

1047
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:35,022
We do what the fuck
we gotta do, man! By any means!

1048
01:05:35,221 --> 01:05:38,636
Ain't that right?
We take care of our shit.

1049
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:40,267
You think I like this shit?

1050
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,128
You think I wanna
spend the rest of my life

1051
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:44,236
pimping your pimpled country ass?

1052
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:47,538
Well, not me! I fucking hate you.

1053
01:05:47,832 --> 01:05:49,806
I hate this shit!

1054
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:51,700
D!

1055
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:57,911
Do you know what I do
in the back of them cars?

1056
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:00,758
Do you?

1057
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:02,479
Everybody's got something to do!

1058
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,635
Everybody's got something important
going on in their life but me, D!

1059
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,688
And I want something!

1060
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:12,401
- What do you want?
- I don't really know, but I want some...

1061
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,577
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1062
01:06:14,777 --> 01:06:18,672
- Tell me what the fuck you wanna do!
- Not this, D!

1063
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:32,313
You know what, man?
I just got you dressed all wrong.

1064
01:06:32,508 --> 01:06:34,996
You know, bitch like you, man,
you need to have on

1065
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:36,340
one of them suits.

1066
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,961
Get you a mobile phone and shit.
Get an ear jack.

1067
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:40,276
Man, you gonna feel different.

1068
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:42,581
I'm gonna put you in some
new shoes tomorrow, man.

1069
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,795
And you gonna feel

1070
01:06:43,996 --> 01:06:46,680
- like you are in charge.
- D!

1071
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:51,926
I know when you're messing
with my head.

1072
01:06:52,285 --> 01:06:54,009
Because I let you.

1073
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:58,330
Because sometimes my head
needs to be messed with.

1074
01:07:00,478 --> 01:07:04,373
But right now, just don't.

1075
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:06,580
Okay?

1076
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:14,138
Okay.

1077
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:30,487
Hey, Shelby,
I need some high-hat, man.

1078
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:32,478
Give me some high-hat
up top, all right?

1079
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,331
Okay, man. This takes a little time.

1080
01:07:37,378 --> 01:07:40,061
Look, it should come in right
after the kick. Right there.

1081
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,375
Yeah, that's it.

1082
01:07:46,882 --> 01:07:49,819
- Try that bit.
- Keep hustlin'

1083
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,781
- Keep flowin'
- How that sound?

1084
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,769
Tell her to put some more dick in it!

1085
01:07:56,963 --> 01:07:59,681
- Most gracious and heavenly Father,
- Okay.

1086
01:07:59,877 --> 01:08:02,910
We ask that you bless this food...

1087
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:07,131
...and our home.

1088
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:25,026
- Hi.
- Hey.

1089
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:26,597
My name is Yevette.

1090
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:30,238
I'm Clyde's... I mean, Key's wife.

1091
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,349
Oh, yeah. He in the back
with the rest of the fellas.

1092
01:08:32,552 --> 01:08:34,440
They fitting to cut something.

1093
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:35,751
Cut?

1094
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:39,010
Well, I like that first one, but you don't.

1095
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:42,306
Well, I think you should
throw out your best ball.

1096
01:08:42,504 --> 01:08:45,374
And to me, that's the second one.

1097
01:08:45,577 --> 01:08:48,478
Okay. We gonna gab, or we gonna
do the damn thing? Which one?

1098
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:52,479
- Hey, let's beat that bitch, then, man.
- Hey, everybody.

1099
01:08:54,794 --> 01:08:57,215
This here's Yevette, Key's wife.

1100
01:08:58,153 --> 01:09:00,969
And look, she brought
everybody sandwiches.

1101
01:09:03,178 --> 01:09:05,382
Yeah, yeah. There's...

1102
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:08,545
There's some dill sauce there
in the middle if y'all wanna dip.

1103
01:09:08,747 --> 01:09:10,089
If you want.

1104
01:09:11,595 --> 01:09:13,832
Hey, you know...

1105
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:17,474
...Key worked really hard
on this last one there,

1106
01:09:17,676 --> 01:09:21,670
so you might wanna
just take a little listen to it.

1107
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,737
Oh, no. I don't wanna interrupt. I...

1108
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:31,235
- It's just dinnertime. I thought y'all...
- But I think we'd like for you to stay.

1109
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:32,964
Right, Key?

1110
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:42,020
Yeah.

1111
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,572
Okay.

1112
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,043
Look, this track here, man, this...

1113
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,055
This is my heart, man, so...

1114
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,189
Before I do my thing,

1115
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,497
put my mouth to this mike,

1116
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,973
I wanna bless it with a kiss
from my primary investor, all right?

1117
01:10:06,224 --> 01:10:07,850
Come on, baby.

1118
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:16,076
Go on, girl.

1119
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:27,401
Hey, just like our primary investor,
that mike is hot.

1120
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:29,935
So kill them fans.

1121
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,205
Look, this is my life

1122
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:59,057
And it's a battle within
I gotta survive

1123
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,629
Even if I'm sinnin' to win

1124
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,573
And if I show no remorse
I'll reap the devil's reward

1125
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,319
He said he'd give me riches
But I'm lookin' for more

1126
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:09,389
When I was young
Witnessed my dad standin' for right

1127
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,012
Black pride in him
Even though he passin' for white

1128
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:14,768
Took years from my life
Now I'm missin' the man

1129
01:11:14,968 --> 01:11:17,717
Mom's on some other shit
And now I'm missin' the plan

1130
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:20,596
So I'm stuck
In this fuck-the-world mold

1131
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,281
All the lessons
To a young teen nigga was cold

1132
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,098
Then my pimpin' ass uncle
Put me up on the game

1133
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:28,915
It really ain't no love
It's 'bout this paper, man

1134
01:11:29,113 --> 01:11:31,698
Put me in a position
Got me out on a mission

1135
01:11:31,897 --> 01:11:34,483
Collectin' from the ho's
Turned me on about pimpin'

1136
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:37,169
A nigga from Memphis
Dealin' with life as a struggle

1137
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:40,086
This is the gift I was given
So I just live by my hustle

1138
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:42,547
Keep hustlin'

1139
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:45,522
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1140
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:48,752
Keep flowin'
Flowin'

1141
01:11:49,019 --> 01:11:51,190
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1142
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,842
Keep hustlin'

1143
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:56,883
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1144
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,668
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

1145
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:02,683
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1146
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:04,916
We got to get this shit done
by the Fourth of July, man,

1147
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,834
because I got some people
I gotta slip this to.

1148
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:10,679
- Who do you know?
- You remember Skinny Black.

1149
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:13,943
I think I see a hater right there.
Hold up.

1150
01:12:15,006 --> 01:12:16,980
Hey, there go Skinny Black, man!

1151
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:19,549
- "Skinny Black" Skinny Black?
- Yeah, I know who Skinny Black is.

1152
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:22,163
I've got all of his early stuff,
back when he was still good.

1153
01:12:22,366 --> 01:12:24,189
Now, do you really know him,
or just know of him?

1154
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:27,350
I mean, he may not know me, because
we went to different schools and all.

1155
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,715
We went to different schools and all,
but, yeah, I know Skinny.

1156
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:32,766
But I'm here to let you know
you ain't taking shit,

1157
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,366
because I'm running
this goddamn thing!

1158
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,594
You wanna make a dollar? Best get
your ass up here with that good shit.

1159
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:38,904
Those boys don't want
dirt weed.

1160
01:12:39,103 --> 01:12:42,235
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

1161
01:12:42,432 --> 01:12:46,208
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this fucked-up Chevy,

1162
01:12:46,657 --> 01:12:47,639
I can pimp Skinny.

1163
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,012
Now I'm just gettin' by
And it's fuckin' with me

1164
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,959
See others doin' big things
They was nothin' to me

1165
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:55,936
I'm seeing what I used to be
And it's lookin' legit

1166
01:12:56,129 --> 01:12:58,716
Got my hands on some music
Started fuckin' with it

1167
01:12:58,914 --> 01:13:01,499
Put it down hard
Then I started pumpin' to this

1168
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:04,449
I let some others get a dose
And they was nuttin' to this

1169
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:07,163
Let me check my connections
'Cause we go back in the day

1170
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:10,015
Say they was lookin' for 'dro
Heard I was hustlin' hay

1171
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,894
Got me connin' my niggas
Spittin' game to my ho's

1172
01:13:13,091 --> 01:13:15,710
This my opportunity
I feel like anything goes

1173
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:18,427
I was never supposed to see
The new millennium, man

1174
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,181
And I refuse
To let my dad die in vain

1175
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,965
So I give it my all
You feel my struggle and pain

1176
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:26,915
If you ain't feelin' what I'm spittin'
Trick, you lame to the game

1177
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,662
But the closest ones to me
Know I'm holdin' it down

1178
01:13:29,861 --> 01:13:32,512
You gonna feel me one day
We gonna be hurtin' the town

1179
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,651
Keep hustlin'

1180
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:38,047
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1181
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:40,612
Keep flowin'

1182
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,614
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1183
01:13:43,814 --> 01:13:46,466
Keep hustlin'
Keep on hustlin'

1184
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:49,282
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1185
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,934
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

1186
01:13:52,455 --> 01:13:55,804
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1187
01:14:41,996 --> 01:14:43,589
Thank you.

1188
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:52,898
Ain't you gonna be hot in your coat?

1189
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:54,989
No, this is good leather, man.

1190
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:57,221
The kind that keep you
at the temperature you wanna be at,

1191
01:14:57,422 --> 01:14:58,851
know what I mean?

1192
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,499
See this thing right here?

1193
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,453
This was my daddy's watch.

1194
01:15:10,992 --> 01:15:13,959
He used to work
for the school district and all...

1195
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:17,285
...fixing them buses all over town.

1196
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:22,252
Yeah.

1197
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:25,262
Every now and then, when I see
them buses go by today,

1198
01:15:25,456 --> 01:15:27,017
I get all excited
because I say,

1199
01:15:27,217 --> 01:15:30,183
"My daddy used to work
on that," you know?

1200
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:34,127
But, you know, after he'd been
there maybe about ten years or so,

1201
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,329
gave him this and...

1202
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:39,248
Kind of thought about burying
him with it, but then again I said,

1203
01:15:39,442 --> 01:15:42,857
"Maybe not, maybe I should keep it
as an heirloom," know what I mean?

1204
01:15:56,437 --> 01:15:59,404
- I got you something.
- What?

1205
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:04,276
Well, it's like, you know, I been
watching them videos and all.

1206
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:09,008
And it be like all them rappers,
they got some chain.

1207
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:11,059
So...

1208
01:16:16,982 --> 01:16:18,127
Oh, shit.

1209
01:16:19,414 --> 01:16:20,624
Yeah.

1210
01:16:20,822 --> 01:16:23,375
You always talking about your name
being right and everything,

1211
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:27,634
so I thought people
could see how you like it spelled out.

1212
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,002
You know, with the J-A-Y.

1213
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:34,133
Damn.

1214
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:39,570
- This shit is perfect, man.
- Let me put it on.

1215
01:16:43,512 --> 01:16:46,098
- I wanna see it.
- Okay.

1216
01:16:50,616 --> 01:16:52,525
- D.
- What?

1217
01:16:55,064 --> 01:16:57,302
I can't believe...
I get like this

1218
01:16:57,498 --> 01:17:00,345
because I'm pregnant and everything...

1219
01:17:00,538 --> 01:17:02,808
...but, you know,
letting me sing on the...

1220
01:17:03,002 --> 01:17:06,036
On the demo and everything
like you do...

1221
01:17:06,682 --> 01:17:10,457
...well, it just...
It made me feel real...

1222
01:17:10,842 --> 01:17:12,818
Real special.

1223
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:14,929
And...

1224
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,580
I mean, I know y'all gonna
be moving on and moving up...

1225
01:17:19,549 --> 01:17:21,752
...and y'all are gonna get
real good people to sing,

1226
01:17:21,948 --> 01:17:25,015
you know, backup for you
and everything...

1227
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:27,894
...but I just...

1228
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:32,219
D, I need you to know
it meant the world to me.

1229
01:17:34,397 --> 01:17:35,739
Come here.

1230
01:17:40,446 --> 01:17:42,901
Thank you so much, D.

1231
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:54,582
Djay, come on, man,
you gotta be there at 9:00, right?

1232
01:17:54,783 --> 01:17:58,362
Calm your ass down, man.
He gonna be there all night.

1233
01:18:02,561 --> 01:18:04,284
I ain't scared.

1234
01:18:07,713 --> 01:18:09,404
I know.

1235
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:26,398
- Come on, man.
- Wow, check it out.

1236
01:18:26,978 --> 01:18:30,557
Okay, look here. Djay, I put some
extra demos in the car, all right, man?

1237
01:18:30,755 --> 01:18:32,129
In case they have
some label folk there.

1238
01:18:32,323 --> 01:18:35,258
Hey, if they want CDs, they just
gonna have to hit us back on that.

1239
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,361
Man, I like that.
I need to get one of those.

1240
01:18:38,563 --> 01:18:39,970
D.

1241
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:44,705
- You all right, man?
- You got your mode on, D?

1242
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:48,635
Hold up for a second.

1243
01:20:13,037 --> 01:20:15,307
Came to party tonight.

1244
01:20:15,662 --> 01:20:18,662
What's happening with you, man?
Where your boy at?

1245
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,836
Over at the big table.

1246
01:20:22,094 --> 01:20:26,218
- I don't see him, man.
- I'll take you over. You ready?

1247
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:30,254
Hey, let's get a drink first, man.

1248
01:20:30,543 --> 01:20:32,551
All right, what the hell.

1249
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:36,875
- Hey, I see you packing tonight, huh?
- Do a bear shit in the woods?

1250
01:20:37,392 --> 01:20:40,840
Hey, who the fuck is that?
Hey, who the fuck is that, man?

1251
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:45,447
Oh, man, I can't believe what my
goddamn eyes are seeing right now!

1252
01:20:45,647 --> 01:20:47,077
I'm gonna have
to get a Seeing Eye nigga

1253
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,932
just to tell me what the fuck
I'm looking at, man!

1254
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:52,169
Is it? Could it be?

1255
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:53,962
The one, the goddamn only...

1256
01:20:54,162 --> 01:20:55,754
Skinny!

1257
01:20:56,113 --> 01:20:57,390
- Is that you?
- Slobs!

1258
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:59,658
- Boy, you fat, black and nasty,
- My nigga.

1259
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:02,126
- Greasy ham-hock, chicken-eating,
- You Ethiopian poster boy.

1260
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:04,493
- Can't-see-your-own-dick,
- Middle Eastern stepchild.

1261
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,951
Ass-crack-longer-than-the-
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I,

1262
01:21:08,146 --> 01:21:09,903
fat, black, nasty bastard!

1263
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:12,554
- What's going on?
- Come here, nigga!

1264
01:21:12,755 --> 01:21:14,282
- How's my nigga?
- Back in the day, nigga.

1265
01:21:14,484 --> 01:21:15,913
- Yeah, that was it.
- Back in the day.

1266
01:21:16,115 --> 01:21:17,360
Back in the motherfucking day.

1267
01:21:17,556 --> 01:21:19,792
Bring your ass over here, man.
Let me get you a drink.

1268
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:21,777
A drink in your hand
and some pussy in your lap.

1269
01:21:21,972 --> 01:21:23,760
Hey, I need that!

1270
01:21:26,356 --> 01:21:28,266
You ready to go over?

1271
01:21:29,043 --> 01:21:31,183
Hold... Hold up, man.

1272
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:37,387
Hey, man.

1273
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:52,012
Skinny, I think
you know my man Djay.

1274
01:21:53,303 --> 01:21:56,303
- Man, I don't know this nigga, man.
- Hey, baby, it's been a long time.

1275
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:58,413
No, it's cool, man. It's nice
to see you home again.

1276
01:21:58,615 --> 01:22:00,590
Got all these folks telling me
I been gone too long.

1277
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:04,687
Like I'm coming back or something.
Like there's a back to get back to.

1278
01:22:04,888 --> 01:22:07,538
I say, fuck!
Best place to keep Memphis

1279
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:10,071
is in my rear-view,
you know what I'm saying?

1280
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:12,022
You know what I'm saying,
whoever the fuck you is?

1281
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:13,232
You know what I'm saying?

1282
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:15,288
Hey, man, what's up
with your boy, man?

1283
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,107
- Skinny.
- I don't need this shit.

1284
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:19,858
This is the man
I was telling you about.

1285
01:22:22,874 --> 01:22:25,591
- Oh, this here the man?
- This here Djay.

1286
01:22:25,786 --> 01:22:28,821
- You and me, we went to different...
- Djay like short-for-something DJ,

1287
01:22:29,019 --> 01:22:31,888
or you mean like... that type of DJ?

1288
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,526
- No, man. It's just... It's just Djay.
- Man, every time I come to Memphis,

1289
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:40,854
my folks hooking me up with this
old dirt-ass weed out here, man.

1290
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:43,157
Like they grow it out the ass
of some redneck or something.

1291
01:22:43,356 --> 01:22:46,105
But my boy Arnel here
say you slinging that killer.

1292
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,675
Is that real, or what?

1293
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,384
Baby, you be the judge for that.

1294
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:54,972
How much I owe you for this, man?

1295
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,108
Here now, seeing how friendly
you are to me

1296
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,732
and the fact we go back in the day,

1297
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,527
it's on me, okay?

1298
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:04,087
Well, go on ahead and have a seat,
my blood brother.

1299
01:23:05,406 --> 01:23:09,268
Hell, yeah. Check this out here.
Smell that. Damn, boy.

1300
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:12,121
Boy, he wasn't playing around
with this here! I think I'm in love.

1301
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:13,747
You remember way back in the day

1302
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,854
when you used to be hustling
your tapes over at the drive-in, man?

1303
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:20,089
- What?
- Look at that ass, boy!

1304
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:24,347
God bless America in this
motherfucker! What's going on, baby?

1305
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:27,741
It's Independence Day!
It is Independence Day, right?

1306
01:23:27,937 --> 01:23:29,431
You know, I got that up from...

1307
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:32,731
There's this little dude brought that
up from New Orleans, man.

1308
01:23:33,665 --> 01:23:35,258
Me first! Me first!

1309
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:19,772
Hey, Skinny!

1310
01:24:22,406 --> 01:24:24,709
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1311
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:29,756
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1312
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:31,965
What the fuck did you just say?

1313
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:37,700
I don't mean no disrespect and all.

1314
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:41,767
I just remember when your first
underground crunk

1315
01:24:41,961 --> 01:24:44,000
hit the motherfucking streets, man,

1316
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,135
that shit flew through Memphis
like a motherfucking typhoon.

1317
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:48,678
Y'all was there, man.

1318
01:24:48,872 --> 01:24:51,972
Nigga couldn't even walk halfway
down the block without the pavement

1319
01:24:52,169 --> 01:24:54,886
crumbling underneath his feet
because some cat was bumping

1320
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:57,896
your shit
out the back of his Caddy, man.

1321
01:24:58,345 --> 01:24:59,938
We just miss you, Skinny, that's all.

1322
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:03,106
Miss me? Get up, bitch.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

1323
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:06,568
- Miss me? Nigga, I don't even...
- Fuck this nigga, man.

1324
01:25:06,763 --> 01:25:08,039
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

1325
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:10,122
You trying to say
I can't cut it no more?

1326
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:12,682
Like I ain't the shit?
That's what you trying to tell me?

1327
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,941
- I ain't saying nothing like that.
- Then what the fuck is you saying?

1328
01:25:16,138 --> 01:25:17,862
What is you saying, then?

1329
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,999
Dig this right here, man.

1330
01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:28,869
One day, this whole motherfucking
place is gonna be gone.

1331
01:25:29,068 --> 01:25:32,199
This club, this city, man.

1332
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:34,983
This whole U.S. Of A., man,
is just gonna turn to dust, right?

1333
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:38,316
And a whole new civilization
is gonna rise from this one.

1334
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:39,916
And they gonna start digging,
you know.

1335
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:42,085
They gonna dig up
the pyramids over in Egypt.

1336
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:44,141
They gonna dig up the Eiffel Tower,

1337
01:25:44,334 --> 01:25:46,506
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State.

1338
01:25:46,702 --> 01:25:48,557
But if a nigga
wanna know about me?

1339
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,409
Wanna know about Memphis?

1340
01:25:50,606 --> 01:25:54,982
All they gotta do is find your
first underground tape, nigga.

1341
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:59,145
North Third Thugs. Motherfuck it,
man. That was the shit.

1342
01:25:59,343 --> 01:26:02,758
You know, I cut that shit in my
own mama's laundry room, man.

1343
01:26:02,961 --> 01:26:04,139
Boy, it was raw as hell,

1344
01:26:04,336 --> 01:26:06,824
but I put everything I had
into that shit, man.

1345
01:26:07,024 --> 01:26:10,602
Yeah, but see, to me that was a sign
of your genius, you know?

1346
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:15,024
See, because it's not enough
for a man to climb Mount Everest.

1347
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:17,486
You know, he gotta do that shit
with the least amount of tools.

1348
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:20,551
- It's about the man. One man.
- One man and his skills.

1349
01:26:20,754 --> 01:26:23,372
Like the samurai say, "The sword is
only as powerful as its master."

1350
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:26,866
And it ain't the size
of the dog in the fight, it's the size

1351
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:29,197
- of the fight in the dog, nigga.
- Of the fight in the dog.

1352
01:26:29,395 --> 01:26:31,184
- My nigga.
- My nigga. Shit.

1353
01:26:31,379 --> 01:26:33,320
You know, and I know
a nigga like you, man,

1354
01:26:33,523 --> 01:26:35,312
a man gotta do
what a man gotta do, right?

1355
01:26:35,507 --> 01:26:37,647
You know, sometimes a nigga
gotta surround himself

1356
01:26:37,843 --> 01:26:39,217
with a whole bunch
of motherfuckers

1357
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:42,673
that think they got a say
in who the fuck Skinny Black is.

1358
01:26:42,868 --> 01:26:44,875
Yeah, they pimping me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

1359
01:26:45,076 --> 01:26:46,603
Gotta break bread with all these

1360
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:49,172
number-crunching motherfuckers,
man. It ain't like it used to be.

1361
01:26:49,364 --> 01:26:51,753
Hey, baby, you ain't gotta explain
a damn thing to me, man.

1362
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,451
Because I'm always
gonna be here for you.

1363
01:26:53,654 --> 01:26:57,232
Same way we was here for you
way back in the day.

1364
01:26:57,429 --> 01:26:59,339
- Oh, man.
- He got a cassette tape.

1365
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:02,159
- Remember that?
- This nigga tripping, man.

1366
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:03,950
Man, look at this shit!

1367
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:07,467
Tigga, Slobs, you see what this nigga
got, man? My underground, man.

1368
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,518
Where the fuck you get this from?
I ain't even got no more of these left!

1369
01:27:11,895 --> 01:27:14,962
Skinny, you got thousands of those
left in you.

1370
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,924
All you gotta do is just come back
home, man. Because we miss you.

1371
01:27:22,328 --> 01:27:24,116
Come home, man.

1372
01:27:30,585 --> 01:27:32,528
You stand behind your product, nigga?

1373
01:27:37,721 --> 01:27:40,142
Is a pig's pussy pork?

1374
01:28:06,013 --> 01:28:08,467
I had this Mustang, right?

1375
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:11,955
Motherfucking tight-ass ride!
You hear me?

1376
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:13,499
Hood snout.

1377
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:15,603
- What the fuck is a hood snout?
- Maple dash.

1378
01:28:15,806 --> 01:28:18,588
It's the goddamn hood come up,
like that from the sides,

1379
01:28:18,781 --> 01:28:19,992
- like a fucking nose.
- Okay.

1380
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:22,557
- Hood snout, maple dash.
- Shit.

1381
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:25,204
You know what I mean?
Two-tone metallic monster

1382
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:28,025
- motherfucker, you know?
- I hear you.

1383
01:28:28,222 --> 01:28:30,427
So I go to my lady's crib
over there in The Courts, right?

1384
01:28:30,623 --> 01:28:32,598
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had one in The Courts.

1385
01:28:32,799 --> 01:28:35,897
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had a few of them in The Courts.

1386
01:28:36,095 --> 01:28:39,325
So, look, man, I go up in there, right?
I get my ugly on real quick,

1387
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,236
come out, my ride is gone!
You hear me?

1388
01:28:42,432 --> 01:28:43,861
- Gone in 60 seconds?
- Gone in 60...

1389
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:45,210
And I nut pretty damn fast,

1390
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:48,986
so them niggas must've
took my ride like that! You hear me?

1391
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:52,698
So I call up my crew. I call my crew
up, I'm like, "Come pick me up."

1392
01:28:52,897 --> 01:28:56,062
Because I know there's only one place
them niggas going riding in my car.

1393
01:28:56,258 --> 01:28:57,817
That's motherfucking
Millbranch, man.

1394
01:28:58,017 --> 01:29:01,400
Millbranch. Millbranch, right?

1395
01:29:01,858 --> 01:29:03,646
So we go down to Millbranch,
and we wait.

1396
01:29:03,842 --> 01:29:08,032
And sure enough, just like I said,
not even an hour go by,

1397
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:10,266
and these niggas
coming in my ride, right?

1398
01:29:10,466 --> 01:29:12,955
So we roll up in front. We box them in.

1399
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:14,561
Next thing you know,
20 motherfuckers

1400
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:16,927
come rushing at these niggas,
pulling them out of my car.

1401
01:29:17,123 --> 01:29:18,716
I'm just screaming
like a little bitch, like,

1402
01:29:18,915 --> 01:29:20,923
"Don't touch my car!
Don't touch my car!"

1403
01:29:21,124 --> 01:29:24,222
Tripping, man. I can sit back
and laugh about it now,

1404
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,355
but goddamn it, it wasn't funny then.
You hear me? At all.

1405
01:29:27,556 --> 01:29:30,971
You know, I'm sitting here
listening to you, man.

1406
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:34,043
And you ain't bragging and shit,
man, you just telling me how it is

1407
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:36,830
being on the side of the moon
that you see from.

1408
01:29:37,029 --> 01:29:38,884
And I realize a nigga like me ain't...

1409
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:41,631
I ain't but a slice of cheese
off your motherfucking cracker, man.

1410
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:44,164
- Right.
- You know...

1411
01:29:45,222 --> 01:29:47,589
...but I got this thing right here.

1412
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:49,506
My motherfucking heart
beats in this thing, man.

1413
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:51,329
Fuck I'm gonna do
with a cassette tape, man?

1414
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:54,308
See, that's my blood pumped
in this shit, man.

1415
01:29:54,504 --> 01:29:56,130
Dog, do you know it's
a new millennium, nigga?

1416
01:29:56,327 --> 01:29:57,920
I can't do nothing
with no cassette tape.

1417
01:29:58,119 --> 01:29:59,713
I don't even have
a cassette-tape player.

1418
01:29:59,912 --> 01:30:02,182
- What the fuck is this shit here?
- I ain't trying to play you.

1419
01:30:02,376 --> 01:30:05,191
I appreciate the fact you talking
to me man-to-man like this and shit.

1420
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:07,489
Hell, treating me like an equal, man.

1421
01:30:07,689 --> 01:30:11,136
And the only reason I give you
that right there is because...

1422
01:30:11,336 --> 01:30:13,475
...you know, you and me,
we come from the same place,

1423
01:30:13,673 --> 01:30:15,778
- you know what I mean?
- Right. That's the truth, man.

1424
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:18,946
- Hell, we old friends, man.
- Definitely. Definitely old friends, man.

1425
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:21,251
And I'm gonna tell you something.

1426
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:22,497
I miss you, Jay.

1427
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:26,116
- Man, it's Djay, man!
- Djay.

1428
01:30:26,314 --> 01:30:28,136
- Djay, man!
- Djay, my bad, nigga.

1429
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,989
- My bad. Djay, Djay.
- Djay.

1430
01:30:30,186 --> 01:30:33,153
You know, in real life, man,

1431
01:30:33,418 --> 01:30:37,031
you know, if you give me a shot...

1432
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,496
...you know, just...

1433
01:30:39,692 --> 01:30:42,790
Just give me a chance
to get my voice heard, man,

1434
01:30:42,988 --> 01:30:44,963
you know, I wouldn't...

1435
01:30:46,156 --> 01:30:48,228
I think I wouldn't even have words
for that shit, man.

1436
01:30:49,229 --> 01:30:51,750
Let me tell you something, man.
Look here.

1437
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:53,956
- Got something I wanna tell you.
- Shit, he getting up.

1438
01:30:54,156 --> 01:30:55,913
- Don't get up.
- Listen to me, this is important.

1439
01:30:56,108 --> 01:30:57,866
Now, this is serious. Look at me.

1440
01:30:58,062 --> 01:30:59,818
Look at me, man.

1441
01:31:00,494 --> 01:31:02,283
- Okay, man.
- You laughing, this shit ain't funny.

1442
01:31:02,478 --> 01:31:04,616
- I'm serious, now.
- Okay, I'm with you.

1443
01:31:04,814 --> 01:31:07,662
Everybody gotta have a dream, boy.

1444
01:31:07,855 --> 01:31:10,986
Everybody got to have a dream.
You hear me?

1445
01:31:11,182 --> 01:31:13,321
I hear you, man.

1446
01:31:13,647 --> 01:31:16,013
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Don't make... Don't fall, man!

1447
01:31:16,207 --> 01:31:18,215
I can't help you, man.

1448
01:31:20,335 --> 01:31:21,929
Where the bathroom at?

1449
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:24,430
Nigga, over there, man. Go get it.

1450
01:31:25,424 --> 01:31:26,733
Hey.

1451
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:30,823
Hey, hey, man.
You better help your nigga, man.

1452
01:31:45,363 --> 01:31:46,923
Thank you.

1453
01:31:50,323 --> 01:31:52,014
- I didn't think it was going in.
- How'd it go?

1454
01:31:52,211 --> 01:31:54,032
Played it like a pro, man.

1455
01:31:54,226 --> 01:31:55,655
My mode is just...

1456
01:31:55,859 --> 01:31:57,834
Just pounding in my head now.

1457
01:31:58,035 --> 01:31:59,082
I mean, and it's...

1458
01:31:59,282 --> 01:32:01,422
It's hard in my heart right now.

1459
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,955
All that boy gotta do is just
play the damn thing,

1460
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:07,891
and it's gonna be undeniable, man.
Undeniable, baby.

1461
01:32:11,156 --> 01:32:14,954
I think you gonna have to get your
weed from some other hustler, man.

1462
01:32:15,892 --> 01:32:19,471
You're on your way.
You're on your way.

1463
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,339
Hey...

1464
01:32:25,847 --> 01:32:27,821
...I got something for you.

1465
01:32:32,118 --> 01:32:35,282
Thank you for everything, man.

1466
01:32:37,655 --> 01:32:39,989
Let me get my jacket, man.

1467
01:32:44,088 --> 01:32:47,056
I'm gonna take me a piss,
and I'm gonna roll, baby.

1468
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:49,264
You take care of yourself.

1469
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:53,873
I will. Next time you see me, man,
I'm gonna be 100 feet tall, man.

1470
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,891
Talking all this...

1471
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,098
Shit, I can't...

1472
01:33:19,867 --> 01:33:22,322
Nigga talking to me.
I don't care about that shit, man.

1473
01:33:22,523 --> 01:33:24,695
Hey, Skinny, man.

1474
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:27,227
You need to take a piss?

1475
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,111
Hey, baby, let's try this shit
standing up.

1476
01:33:29,309 --> 01:33:30,236
Come on, man. Come on.

1477
01:33:30,428 --> 01:33:33,363
- Now, don't try...
- Come on. Big motherfucker.

1478
01:33:33,564 --> 01:33:35,768
Nigga talking to me
about his bullshit.

1479
01:33:35,965 --> 01:33:38,104
Nigga, I'm talking to you, man.

1480
01:33:38,302 --> 01:33:41,847
I'm talking to you, dog. You need
a little help, okay? Stay with me here.

1481
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:45,268
I'm gonna pull your pants up, nigga.
I ain't no faggot or nothing.

1482
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:47,707
You know, shit, ain't too many men

1483
01:33:47,903 --> 01:33:50,837
pull a nigga's dick up for him. Shit.

1484
01:33:51,454 --> 01:33:53,757
You better show me some love
for this one, man.

1485
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:55,739
You know, one day...

1486
01:33:55,935 --> 01:33:57,823
One day, you and me
gonna be on tour, man.

1487
01:33:58,016 --> 01:33:59,739
- I ain't gonna do this shit for you.
- Tour?

1488
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,496
- What tour you taking about?
- Shit, man.

1489
01:34:01,695 --> 01:34:02,841
Man, you know, a fucked-up nigga

1490
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,593
would do some wild shit
to you right now.

1491
01:34:05,792 --> 01:34:08,608
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

1492
01:34:08,801 --> 01:34:11,103
Come on, baby.
Let's get the fuck up...

1493
01:34:58,181 --> 01:35:00,320
Hey, Skinny, man.

1494
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:04,514
You tell me this shit

1495
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:10,140
Skinny?

1496
01:35:10,343 --> 01:35:11,717
Hey, bitch.

1497
01:35:11,911 --> 01:35:13,634
You tell me this shit fell out
your pocket, man.

1498
01:35:13,831 --> 01:35:16,581
- Hey, hey, hey, man.
- Hey, what, man?

1499
01:35:16,776 --> 01:35:18,685
You know what you could do?

1500
01:35:18,887 --> 01:35:22,335
What can I do, man?
You tell me what I can do, man.

1501
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,556
You can suck my dick, bitch.

1502
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,825
Hey, bitch, why don't you
suck on this shit? Motherfucker!

1503
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:41,535
This what the fuck you want, man?

1504
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:44,007
This what the fuck you want, man?

1505
01:35:50,026 --> 01:35:51,881
Oh, shit.

1506
01:35:57,867 --> 01:35:59,144
Oh, God.

1507
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,090
Oh, Skinny, man.
Hey. Hey, nigga.

1508
01:36:02,283 --> 01:36:05,098
Hey, Skinny! Hey, Skinny,
wake the fuck up, man!

1509
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:07,529
Skinny, come on, man!
Come on, man. Come on, nigga.

1510
01:36:07,724 --> 01:36:09,961
Breathe, you motherfucker!

1511
01:36:10,155 --> 01:36:12,131
Hey, yo, Skin...
What the...?!

1512
01:36:13,069 --> 01:36:14,596
Shit!

1513
01:36:15,821 --> 01:36:17,709
Get the fuck up! Get your ass up!

1514
01:36:17,902 --> 01:36:19,788
Get your ass up, motherfucker!

1515
01:36:19,981 --> 01:36:21,410
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, motherfuckers,

1516
01:36:21,614 --> 01:36:22,541
I'm coming out now!

1517
01:36:22,734 --> 01:36:24,522
If I see any gleam, motherfuckers,

1518
01:36:24,717 --> 01:36:26,408
I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker
in his head!

1519
01:36:26,606 --> 01:36:27,653
- Shoot this nigga!
- Get him!

1520
01:36:27,854 --> 01:36:29,283
- Shoot this nigga!
- Fuck off, bitch!

1521
01:36:29,486 --> 01:36:31,046
Hey, niggas, back the fuck up!

1522
01:36:31,246 --> 01:36:34,029
- Not tonight, nigga! Not tonight!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

1523
01:37:16,243 --> 01:37:17,618
There he is!
There that motherfucker go!

1524
01:37:17,812 --> 01:37:19,089
- Right there!
- Away from the door.

1525
01:37:19,284 --> 01:37:21,323
Hey, man, I ain't armed.
It's in the glove.

1526
01:37:21,523 --> 01:37:24,339
- It's in the glove, man.
- Djay! Djay!

1527
01:37:24,533 --> 01:37:26,474
Hey, wait, man! Hey, Shug, it's okay.
Hey, wait!

1528
01:37:26,867 --> 01:37:28,112
- Hey, get off my foot, man.
- Djay!

1529
01:37:28,308 --> 01:37:29,236
Hey lay off my foot, man!

1530
01:37:29,429 --> 01:37:31,151
- Fuck you, man! Hey, man!
- Get down on the car!

1531
01:37:31,348 --> 01:37:34,764
- Hey, get them off my girl!
- Hey, get your hands off her!

1532
01:37:34,965 --> 01:37:36,306
Hey, man!

1533
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,258
- Fuck!
- What the fuck's up now, nigga?

1534
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:40,909
- Bust his motherfucking head, man.
- Nigga, come on, come on.

1535
01:37:41,111 --> 01:37:42,866
Djay, please, what did you do?

1536
01:37:43,285 --> 01:37:45,555
Hey, man! Come on, man!
He turned himself in, man!

1537
01:37:46,007 --> 01:37:48,340
You ain't gotta dog-pile
on him like that!

1538
01:37:48,534 --> 01:37:50,771
Hey, yo, she pregnant, man!

1539
01:37:51,703 --> 01:37:53,491
Don't forget, man,
you knock this motherfucker out.

1540
01:37:53,686 --> 01:37:56,305
He's gonna have to come around here.

1541
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:59,086
Djay, tell me what to do, please.

1542
01:37:59,288 --> 01:38:01,557
Please tell me what to do.

1543
01:38:01,752 --> 01:38:03,727
Baby, take my pad.

1544
01:38:04,407 --> 01:38:06,961
I want you to get that shit up
on the radio.

1545
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,713
You put it in the DJ's hand
yourself, you hear me?

1546
01:38:09,912 --> 01:38:10,895
- Okay, I will.
- Get him up.

1547
01:38:11,096 --> 01:38:13,366
I got a stack of demos
right there in the car.

1548
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,975
I want you to get Key and them...
Key, y'all put my shit on CD!

1549
01:38:17,177 --> 01:38:18,125
All right, man!

1550
01:38:19,129 --> 01:38:20,853
Nola, you in charge and shit,
all right?

1551
01:38:21,049 --> 01:38:23,919
In two weeks, I wanna hear my shit
in the yard at 2:01, you hear me?

1552
01:38:25,627 --> 01:38:28,114
- Get him!
- Motherfucker!

1553
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:32,464
- Bitch!
- Don't hit him like that!

1554
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:36,145
Get him! Bitch!

1555
01:38:36,347 --> 01:38:37,524
D!

1556
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,499
I wanna hear my shit in the yard,
you hear me.

1557
01:38:41,693 --> 01:38:43,667
You in charge.
I wanna hear you say that.

1558
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:45,429
- Say it!
- I'm in charge.

1559
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:46,970
- You my partner.
- I know.

1560
01:38:47,164 --> 01:38:50,295
- Say, "I'm in charge!"
- I'm in charge!

1561
01:38:53,628 --> 01:38:55,417
- All right, man.
- Get in the car.

1562
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:56,821
Watch your head.

1563
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:59,060
I'm in charge.

1564
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,341
Me. I promise.

1565
01:39:17,663 --> 01:39:19,802
Go get down in the yard.

1566
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:57,049
I tried calling the house, you know...

1567
01:39:57,379 --> 01:40:00,859
...but the phone's just...
- They shut them off.

1568
01:40:03,235 --> 01:40:05,472
But me and Yevette, we...

1569
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:07,519
We chipping in.

1570
01:40:07,845 --> 01:40:09,405
Thank you.

1571
01:40:16,548 --> 01:40:18,752
She precious, man.

1572
01:40:20,005 --> 01:40:21,729
Beautiful little girl.

1573
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:27,773
- Named her Keisha.
- Keisha.

1574
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:31,490
That's a good handle, man.

1575
01:40:31,751 --> 01:40:33,376
I like that.

1576
01:40:34,887 --> 01:40:36,797
You know, with all I gotta do...

1577
01:40:37,447 --> 01:40:40,349
...all these people in my life, man...

1578
01:40:42,312 --> 01:40:44,832
...feels like an eternity in here.

1579
01:40:46,023 --> 01:40:48,742
Can't seem to find my mode now.

1580
01:40:49,321 --> 01:40:51,524
Don't hear a damn thing.

1581
01:40:53,257 --> 01:40:54,818
Djay...

1582
01:41:00,009 --> 01:41:02,824
...did you know Skinny Black
before that night?

1583
01:41:10,187 --> 01:41:12,870
You know that
little girl Keisha, right?

1584
01:41:14,187 --> 01:41:16,391
One day she gonna dream big,

1585
01:41:16,587 --> 01:41:19,008
the way kids do, you know.

1586
01:41:19,371 --> 01:41:22,720
And she gonna come to me
and ask me

1587
01:41:22,923 --> 01:41:26,786
when she grow up,
can she become president?

1588
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:31,530
Now, I know that little girl got a ho
for a mama and a trick for a daddy,

1589
01:41:31,725 --> 01:41:34,212
that nobody even know where he at.

1590
01:41:35,149 --> 01:41:37,156
But I tell you something.

1591
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:40,490
I'm gonna look her right in the eye...

1592
01:41:41,293 --> 01:41:43,268
...and I'm gonna lie.

1593
01:41:43,982 --> 01:41:46,665
Because sometimes
that's what you gotta do.

1594
01:41:56,623 --> 01:41:58,957
How you been doing, man?

1595
01:42:03,535 --> 01:42:05,837
Back to the same old shit.

1596
01:42:06,032 --> 01:42:09,807
About six months ago,
my neighbor brought my mail.

1597
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:12,902
It was mail that she'd gotten
from her neighbor.

1598
01:42:13,105 --> 01:42:14,534
It was addressed to me.

1599
01:42:14,737 --> 01:42:18,349
The court depositions
and the high school recitals.

1600
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:22,063
Talk about eternity, man.

1601
01:42:23,058 --> 01:42:25,261
It's been on my mind too.

1602
01:42:27,698 --> 01:42:30,119
It's on all our minds.

1603
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:32,876
We was just dead, Djay.

1604
01:42:33,395 --> 01:42:35,816
Locked up, just like you.

1605
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:41,168
But ain't no sorrow gonna
take away Shug's song.

1606
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,273
Let me tell you that.

1607
01:42:43,507 --> 01:42:46,060
That woman, she got love for you.

1608
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:49,741
So when you talk about eternity...

1609
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,005
...you think about your woman.

1610
01:42:55,829 --> 01:42:58,218
- Hey, how's Nola, man?
- Nola?

1611
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,903
Let me tell you something, man.

1612
01:43:02,549 --> 01:43:05,200
That girl got a mode all her own.

1613
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,037
She hit the bricks running.

1614
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:17,777
For some reason, she got it stuck
in her head that she was in charge.

1615
01:43:17,976 --> 01:43:23,126
We can't lay around licking our ass
all day like a dog, you know?

1616
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,807
I mean, we man.

1617
01:43:26,007 --> 01:43:30,677
I mean, I know I'm a girl and all,
but we mankind.

1618
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,142
Man, she hit every shake joint,

1619
01:43:33,336 --> 01:43:36,501
radio station in Memphis
and then some.

1620
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:38,485
I don't know how she did it.

1621
01:43:38,681 --> 01:43:41,136
That girl got skills.

1622
01:43:52,954 --> 01:43:54,809
Power 107. 1.
Number one for hip-hop.

1623
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:56,694
This your man Boogaloo
holding you down.

1624
01:43:56,892 --> 01:43:59,739
Man, I got a brand-new exclusive
from my man Djay.

1625
01:43:59,932 --> 01:44:02,932
Straight from the north, north, north.
Put your thumbs up out there, man.

1626
01:44:03,131 --> 01:44:05,302
And I hear my man Djay...
Djay, you gotta call me,

1627
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:08,534
let me know if it's true.
Did you slap Skinny Black?

1628
01:44:08,732 --> 01:44:09,877
Did you do it, man?

1629
01:44:10,076 --> 01:44:11,734
Holler at me, man.
Power 107. 1.

1630
01:44:11,932 --> 01:44:13,590
Brand-new, right here.

1631
01:44:15,164 --> 01:44:17,620
Hey, man, this is me!
I made this beat!

1632
01:44:22,397 --> 01:44:25,115
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1633
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:27,961
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1634
01:44:31,454 --> 01:44:32,796
Whoop that trick

1635
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:37,752
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1636
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:43,163
So if you don't mind,

1637
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:44,701
Nola and I, we got a few points

1638
01:44:44,896 --> 01:44:48,027
we'd like to talk about
in regards to your agenda.

1639
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,036
That's if you got a minute.

1640
01:44:55,584 --> 01:44:57,494
For you, Key...

1641
01:44:57,697 --> 01:44:59,770
...I got 11 months.

1642
01:45:19,683 --> 01:45:22,073
Hey, Al, hold up, hold up.

1643
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:24,643
Ain't this the guy on the radio with
that "Whoop That Trick" song?

1644
01:45:24,837 --> 01:45:26,396
- What you talking about?
- Man, this the cat

1645
01:45:26,596 --> 01:45:28,931
who stomped on Skinny
with that "Whoop That Trick" song.

1646
01:45:29,124 --> 01:45:30,172
You know that song.

1647
01:45:30,372 --> 01:45:33,339
- Whoop that trick, get 'em
- Whoop that trick, get 'em

1648
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,882
Whoop that trick
Get 'em

1649
01:45:35,077 --> 01:45:37,116

1650
01:45:39,717 --> 01:45:40,829
Yeah, man.

1651
01:45:41,029 --> 01:45:42,687
Look, man.

1652
01:45:42,885 --> 01:45:45,220

- Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

1653
01:45:45,414 --> 01:45:48,163
We got it going on both sides
of the law, being from the streets

1654
01:45:48,358 --> 01:45:49,634
and being officers of the law.

1655
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,554
You know what I'm saying?
Our stage name, Five-0.

1656
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:53,606
They call me Big Five-0.

1657
01:45:53,798 --> 01:45:55,205
Look, man,

1658
01:45:55,399 --> 01:45:57,919

the rec room or something like that,

and tell us what you think.

1660
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:11,685

1661
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,302
Everybody gotta have a dream.
