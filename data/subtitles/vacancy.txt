2
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,766
Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?

3
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,952
There's a goddamn raccoon
in the middle of the road.

4
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:45,223
Jesus.

5
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,474
Well, better to kill us

6
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,510
than get a little roadkill
on the car, huh?

7
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,278
Well, we're still alive.

8
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,465
I can tell by the pissy look
that you're giving me.

9
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,526
This isn't the interstate.

10
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,662
There was a wreck.
It was all backed up.

11
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,164
I took a shortcut.

12
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,498
To where?

13
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,451
Can you hear that?

14
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,403
Hear what?

15
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,039
I think the engine
just made a noise.

16
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,441
Well, it's kind of late
for a breakdown.

17
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,877
Should've stopped somewhere
earlier.

18
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,846
Well, I popped some of those
trucker pills.

19
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,415
I thought I could make it
the whole way.

20
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,219
Where are we?

21
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,259
You were really dreaming
over there earlier.

22
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,261
You were mumbling
and jerking around.

23
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,296
I dreamt you were
trying to kill me.

24
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,567
We were at my parents'
anniversary party,

25
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,569
and my mother
wouldn't stop talking.

26
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,655
You started screaming
you couldn't take it anymore

27
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:10,307
and then you tried
to strangle me.

28
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:13,177
Hey, at least you were
dreaming about me, right?

29
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,711
That's kind of an improvement.

30
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,947
Shit.

31
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,582
Jesus.

32
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,517
Mm.
You okay?

33
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:24,454
I... I keep telling you
how stupid that is to do that.

34
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:26,107
You oughta just kinda...

35
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,392
bite into the apple
like the rest of the world.

36
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,960
It hurts my teeth.

37
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,545
As bad as cutting
your finger off?

38
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,848
It's not anything.

39
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,282
You want me to drive
for a while?

40
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,951
No. I don't.

41
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,855
Why don't you just go ahead
and go back to sleep?

42
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,202
Remember how Charlie
used to dance around

43
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,086
even when there was
no music playing...?

44
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:14,839
I'm tired, David.

45
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,562
See, I think that should be us
just about there.

46
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,332
Why didn't you just
stay on the interstate?

47
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,705
Heh. I don't know.

48
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,541
Guess I just wanted to make this

49
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,910
as miserable as possible,
you know?

50
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,147
See just how big a bitch
you'd be about it.

51
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,256
I-I just thought
it would be faster, you know?

52
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,701
Shit.

53
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,370
Is that something?

54
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,208
Do you think
they're closed?

55
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,176
Since 1957.

56
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,345
That's too bad,

57
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,913
'cause they got
good gas prices.

58
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,938
Look, if you're too tired,
I'll drive.

59
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,973
I-I told you, I'm fine.

60
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:02,797
Okay.
See, that town there.

61
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,165
E-Elida.

62
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,699
You were asleep,
but we went through there

63
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,818
about three hours ago.

64
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,154
Well, that should put us
down here somewhere.

65
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,706
I mean, that's a town.

66
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,958
Downey. I mean, they would have
a real gas station.

67
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,793
If that's really
where we are.

68
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,344
I think that
we're headed south.

69
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,647
I mean, eventually,
we've got to hit a...

70
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,648
Oh, my God.

71
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,133
Sorry.

72
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,050
Oh, my God.

73
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,119
Sorry.
It's okay.

74
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,138
You got to me
right before I headed out.

75
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,105
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,473
I gotta warn you, though.
The...

77
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,176
The gas price is a little
steeper than the sign says.

78
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,111
Actually, we're just...
We're having, uh,

79
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,863
some engine problems.

80
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,948
Yeah, he dodged a squirrel
a few miles back.

81
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,116
It's a raccoon.

82
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,517
Yeah.
And we're lost.

83
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,903
Well, she's lost.
I actually know

84
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,606
exactly where we are.
We're on our way to Downey.

85
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:53,614
He's trying to tell you
it's the other way, David.

86
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,433
Yeah. Sorry, man.

87
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,467
It's okay.
It's really easy to get

88
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,319
turned around out here
without a map.

89
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,275
Downey's, like,
30 miles back, man.

90
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,277
Really?

91
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,847
Look, I'll tell you what.
Um, pop the hood.

92
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,216
I'll check the engine and make
sure you can get that far.

93
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,101
Really? Thanks.
That would be great.

94
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:16,404
Great.
Thank you so much.

95
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:26,430
Yeah, I went off the road there
when I missed the raccoon.

96
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,799
I think I hit a low spot.

97
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,777
Yeah. Thanks, man.

98
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,283
Is he gonna fix it?

99
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:09,990
What do you think?

100
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,877
Well, the, uh...
The fan blade's bent.

101
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,578
Rock must have hit it. Heh.

102
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,631
Yeah, she'll drive fine,
just noisy.

103
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,849
That's all.

104
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,751
You might wanna have someone
smarter than me

105
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,920
take a look at it
when you get where you're going.

106
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,723
I'll do that. Thanks.
So now, what do I owe you?

107
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,258
Oh, no, nothing.
No, we're good.

108
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,826
Hell, I should pay you

109
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,429
for finally giving me
something to do.

110
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,850
Now, um, do you need help
getting back to Downey?

111
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,151
Yes.
Well, actually,

112
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,419
i-if you could just point us
towards the interstate,

113
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,938
that'd be great.

114
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,322
Oh.

115
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,158
Well, you don't want
Downey, then.

116
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,542
Okay.

117
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,896
I'll tell you what you do.
You take this road here, right?

118
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,263
And...
And you follow it down

119
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,783
until you hit
a grove of trees on your right.

120
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,884
You take that.

121
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,220
Keep going
till you hit Westcliff.

122
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,588
It'll be a four-lane there.

123
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,457
Westcliff.
Make a left on that,

124
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,725
and that'll take you
where you need to be.

125
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,859
Okay.

126
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,594
Thank you.
Perfect. Thanks a lot.

127
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:05,896
And you know what?

128
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,799
Man, I'd feel a lot better
if you just took this.

129
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,718
Thanks for staying out so late
and helping us.

130
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,022
Well...

131
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,358
you just bought yourself
a 20-dollar sparkler, then.

132
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,761
Because every day's
4th of July's at Small's.

133
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:24,281
Owner makes me say that.
Heh-heh!

134
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:26,400
Here you go.

135
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,151
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

136
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,320
And drive careful.

137
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,555
Okay, thanks.

138
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:56,196
Guess I ought to buy you
a box of those sparklers, huh?

139
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,842
So how far did he say
this Westcliff place is?

140
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,110
He didn't.

141
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,446
And I can't even find it
on the fucking map.

142
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,680
David.

143
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,048
What, did we hit something?

144
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,082
Fucking...

145
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:18,619
Yeah, probably another squirrel.

146
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,388
You know,
i-it was a fucking raccoon.

147
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,290
Whatever.
I mean, Jesus Christ,

148
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,091
why do you have...

149
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,529
Oh, what the hell?

150
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,605
Son of a bitch!

151
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,578
Son of a bitch.

152
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,080
So much for being able
to drive it the whole way.

153
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,317
God. Perfect. No signal.

154
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,634
Damn it.

155
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,454
Can't a car run
without a fan?

156
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,456
Evidently not.

157
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:21,398
Okay, give it a try for me,
all right?

158
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,600
It's not gonna work.

159
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,902
Jesus Christ.

160
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,203
Would...?

161
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,722
Would you just give it a try
for me, please, honey?

162
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,665
Goddamn it.

163
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,971
So how far back
was the gas station?

164
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,139
I don't know.

165
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,407
About a mile?

166
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,310
Kind of a long walk
in the middle of the night.

167
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,812
Yeah. I mean,
I guess we could just sit here

168
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,747
and hope some idiots like us
come along

169
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,281
and give us a hand, huh?

170
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:56,983
I didn't get us lost.

171
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,284
No. You...

172
00:13:58,286 --> 00:13:59,553
You slept for 300 miles,

173
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,055
thanks to your
Zoloft-Prozac cocktail.

174
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,186
Fuck!

175
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,796
Well...

176
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,549
at least we know
there's someplace back there.

177
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:31,017
Oh, yeah, the guy that helped us
so much before.

178
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,386
Well, you know,

179
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,588
you could get
another sparkler, Amy.

180
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,589
Asshole.

181
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,524
Whatever you say.

182
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,326
Grow a penis.

183
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,009
Never see stars anymore.

184
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,378
At least not in L.A.

185
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,013
Kind of nice out here,
really.

186
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,716
I bet Charlie
would have liked it.

187
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,784
We should've brought him
sometime.

188
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,553
We never went anywhere.

189
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,389
The job was always
too important to leave.

190
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,923
Why do you do that?
What?

191
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,692
Every time I mention his name,
you take a shot at me.

192
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:32,095
Well, stop mentioning his name.
See, I'm not like you.

193
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,663
I'd rather
just kind of remember him

194
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:34,964
and deal with the pain.

195
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,334
Okay, you know what, David?
Do what you want.

196
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,222
He said he was getting ready
to close, remember?

197
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,892
Shit.

198
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,961
Look, let's just go back
to the car.

199
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,263
You can sleep on the hood
and stare up at the stars

200
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,398
you love so much.

201
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,068
Maybe they'll know
where we can find the guy.

202
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,772
Oh, God.

203
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,869
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh.

204
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,276
What is that?

205
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,212
I want to go.
No.

206
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,115
It's okay.
David.

207
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,453
Let's just go back
to the car.

208
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,938
What are you doing?
Don't ring the bell.

209
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,618
Sorry.

210
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,537
Hey, folks.
Hi.

211
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,556
How can I help you?

212
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,309
Everything, uh,
okay back there?

213
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,077
Oh!

214
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,064
Can we just...?
Can we just go?

215
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,499
It's okay.

216
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,235
Sorry.

217
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,904
Things get a little boring
around here late nights.

218
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,740
I believe that.

219
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,925
Say, um, there's a mechanic
at the garage over there.

220
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,594
He helped us with our car
earlier. You know him?

221
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,614
I think he's gone home
for the night.

222
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,682
He'll probably be back
tomorrow morning.

223
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:50,850
Right.
Well, I was wondering

224
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,435
if you could get in touch
with him.

225
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,971
The car actually broke down
about two miles back there.

226
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,422
We just walked up here.

227
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:59,776
I sure can't. I sure can't.
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,462
Do you know
another garage?

229
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:04,615
Hm...

230
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,151
There's Clark's...

231
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,186
about 20 miles east.

232
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:11,355
Okay.

233
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,089
Well, may I borrow
your phone?

234
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,324
I'd like
to give them a call,

235
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,977
see if they can maybe come out
and give us a hand.

236
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,929
All I got's a payphone,
right out there.

237
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:20,948
That's great.

238
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,366
Works on dimes
if you need 'em.

239
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,734
Okay, I do.

240
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,526
It's real.

241
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,256
No, i-it doesn't have to be
exact change.

242
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,157
Mm-hm.

243
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:07,928
Thank you.

244
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:11,915
Trouble is...

245
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:16,336
Clark's won't be open either.

246
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:17,887
Not this late.

247
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:19,957
So I guess
I don't need these, huh?

248
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,293
Not if you need a garage.

249
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,278
Yeah. We do.

250
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,097
But like I said,

251
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,966
guy over there will be, uh,
back around 8,

252
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,384
if you can wait that long.

253
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,135
I'm sure he can get you
up and running.

254
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,222
Meanwhile, I'm wide open here.

255
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:36,623
Shocking.

256
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,092
Okay. Thanks.

257
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,562
Well, uh...

258
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,114
we can either stay here,

259
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,748
or we walk all the way back
to the car.

260
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,652
David, this is a fucking
nightmare. I don't know.

261
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,738
Yeah, we'll go ahead
and stay here, thanks.

262
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,775
I can give you two
the honeymoon suite

263
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,859
for $5 extra.

264
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,410
It's got a few perks
the others don't.

265
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,862
Regular room
will be fine.

266
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,846
Thank you.
What the heck?

267
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:01,331
I'll give it to you
for the same rate.

268
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,449
Well, whatever works.

269
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,783
Whatever's fastest.

270
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,437
All right,
I'll give you my card.

271
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,706
Ooh, we're not set up
for plastic here, friend.

272
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,858
Cash only.
Okay.

273
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,160
I got cash.

274
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,296
I guess you don't take dimes,
though, do you?

275
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,569
Just kidding around.

276
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:23,920
Ah.

277
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,239
I'm gonna need to see ID
on one of you.

278
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,058
Sort of a deposit
on the room's contents...

279
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,726
Look, sir, you... We're...

280
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,062
You can trust us.
We're not gonna steal anything.

281
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,781
I'm not up to lugging a bunch
of dirty towels back to the car

282
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,116
in the morning, so...

283
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,535
I'm... I'm...
I'm sure you won't,

284
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,853
but rules are rules.

285
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:43,540
I don't make 'em.
I'm just a manager.

286
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,158
Of course. Here you go.

287
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,014
It's right there on the corner,
Number 4.

288
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,433
Might have to jiggle the handle
a little bit to open her up.

289
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,251
She's as sticky as an old whore.

290
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,688
Right.
'Scuse my language, ma'am.

291
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,639
Y'all have a great night.

292
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,825
Let's go. Thank you.

293
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,642
Oh, this is great.

294
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,421
Good thing we upgraded.

295
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,660
Ugh.

296
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:45,478
We've had our tetanus shots,
right?

297
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,097
Oh, hey, if you wanna know
what's on March of '97,

298
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,466
I got the answer.

299
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm sleeping in my clothes.

300
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:05,865
I'm gonna sleep
in my shoes.

301
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,522
I guess it could be worse,
you know.

302
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,740
We could be stuck in that
twin bed at your folks' house,

303
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,976
trying to pretend
like we're a happy couple.

304
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,549
God, I should have
told my mom about us.

305
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,870
I... Well, why ruin
their party, though?

306
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,739
I think the thing to do
is just tell them

307
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,725
after we've signed the papers.

308
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,930
It felt really strange
to be at that party.

309
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:42,636
Watching them all celebrate
being together all those years.

310
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,008
How did it make you feel?

311
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,360
I don't know.

312
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,931
Tired.

313
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:01,621
Yeah.

314
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:10,363
I'm sorry.

315
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:24,644
Never should've gotten off
the interstate, either.

316
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:29,815
And miss our one last
great adventure together?

317
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,169
Yeah.

318
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:48,818
David.

319
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,354
Sorry.

320
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,124
Concierge.

321
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,427
Hello?

322
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,581
Hello?

323
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,667
There's no one there.

324
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,437
Jesus Christ.

325
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,590
What the hell is that?

326
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,590
Hello?

327
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:36,833
You heard that, right?

328
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,734
Uh-huh.

329
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,086
Don't touch that.

330
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,942
Who is it?

331
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:52,215
Stay there.
David, wait.

332
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,887
Yeah?

333
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:07,630
David, don't.

334
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,034
It's coming from the room
next door, Amy.

335
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,702
I know. Don't open it.

336
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:30,186
Yeah, what do you need?

337
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,092
Hello?

338
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:41,448
When we walked over here,

339
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,149
were there any cars
in the parking lot?

340
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,401
Just check.

341
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,501
Ugh.

342
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,075
There's a truck.

343
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,093
It's probably
the manager guy's.

344
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:04,153
I don't know what the deal is,
but it's...

345
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,656
It's a little late
for this shit, okay?

346
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,657
So...

347
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,312
Close the door, David.

348
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,499
Close the door!

349
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,120
Damn it!
Why mess with them?

350
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,588
No, I'm not messing
with them.

351
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,724
I'm just trying to figure out
what they're doing.

352
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,660
Just wait.

353
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,685
Who is it?

354
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,726
I don't know
what your problem is, asshole!

355
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:05,531
I won't fucking go along
with this, goddamn it.

356
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,484
Oh, David, don't.

357
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,252
I'm gonna call the manager
and tell him

358
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:11,871
someone's bothering us.

359
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,453
Why don't you open the door?

360
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,658
Play some games? I'll play
some fucking games with you.

361
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:40,466
That's real funny, jerk-off.

362
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,634
Lock the door.

363
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:43,853
What?
Where are you going?

364
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,888
I'm gonna go take care
of this prick.

365
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,936
Everything all right,
Mr. Fox?

366
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:20,639
Uh, no, because the asshole
in the room right beside us

367
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:22,441
keeps banging on the walls
and he won't stop.

368
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,893
You got any ideas?

369
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,645
The room beside you?

370
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,013
Yeah, Room 3.

371
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,580
Uh, I go over there to talk
to the guy

372
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:29,715
and try and get him to stop,

373
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:31,383
but he just kinda
keeps doing it.

374
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:33,753
So, uh, I gotta say,

375
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,989
I-I don't know
what his problem is.

376
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:39,191
Now, that is very strange,
seeing as you folks

377
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,578
are the only guests
I got in here tonight.

378
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,112
Well, somebody's
in there, okay?

379
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,314
And I gotta say,
I'm pretty exhausted.

380
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,683
You...
You sure it's Room 3?

381
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,919
Yeah, we're in the corner,
right? Number 4?

382
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,588
Well, it's the room
right beside us

383
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,823
with the big, rusty 3
on it, okay?

384
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,974
So I'm pretty sure.

385
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,075
Okay, okay.

386
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,731
Every once in a blue moon
a college kid or drifter

387
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,367
will sneak in through the window
for a good night's sleep.

388
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,987
In the morning the cleaning lady
will find trash on the floor

389
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,222
or shit in the toilet.

390
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,623
Usually they don't cause much
of a disturbance, so...

391
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,959
Well, this one is, okay?

392
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,626
Let me go
check it out for you.

393
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:17,747
And, uh, if those work,
I'd think about bringing one.

394
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,182
Oh.

395
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,917
I am ass-tired
of shooting at crows.

396
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,151
Give me a hand.

397
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,339
Okay.

398
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:46,141
It's okay.

399
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:53,032
So, what happened?
What did he say?

400
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,633
He just thinks
it's some drunk.

401
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,869
He's gonna
take care of it.

402
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:58,037
Did you hear anything else?

403
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,038
No.

404
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,239
I was kinda hoping
I would.

405
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,540
Then I'd know
where they were.

406
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,742
Well, I'm sure they just saw me
walk over there

407
00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:05,544
and then they took off.

408
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:09,615
Now we get to enjoy
this luxury resort

409
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,150
in peace and quiet.

410
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:13,286
David, maybe we should
just leave.

411
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:16,639
Just go back to the car.

412
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,675
I'm not gonna walk
any more tonight, okay?

413
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,178
Let's just... Just gut it out
here for a few hours.

414
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,446
We'll get the car fixed.

415
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,880
We'll just get the hell
out of here.

416
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:27,216
Okay?
Okay.

417
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,185
Okay.

418
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,225
You're not watching that
right now?

419
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,227
No, why?

420
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,596
Look, I'm just gonna unwind
a little bit.

421
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:44,600
And make sure the guy
from next door is gone.

422
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,285
You gotta take advantage
of the perks.

423
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,303
It's worth
the extra five bucks.

424
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,124
Or is it?

425
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,178
God!
Shit.

426
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,779
W-what is it?

427
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,948
This bathroom's
disgusting.

428
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,801
Yeah?

429
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,603
David?
Yes?

430
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:06,789
That manager guy's definitely
going over there, right?

431
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,058
Yeah, with a six-shooter.

432
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,294
Gonna take care of it,
so just relax.

433
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:14,797
Gotta make sure his only
two guests are happy.

434
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,918
This looks like
a real library of classics.

435
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,448
Jesus.

436
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,017
Bet this really gets
the honeymooners in the mood.

437
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:39,939
Can you turn that off?

438
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:42,175
It's the last thing
I need right now.

439
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,409
Well, the least they could do
is give us a little porn.

440
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,935
Can't you just mute it
or something,

441
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,654
so I don't have to hear it?

442
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,013
<i>You get the fuck out of here!</i>

443
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,341
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

444
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,498
I told you
to turn it off.

445
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:49,241
What is it?

446
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,230
David?

447
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,967
Do you...?

448
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,802
Do you see that room?

449
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,621
From the movie?

450
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:03,539
What about it?

451
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:18,905
What movie is that?

452
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:21,407
I... I...
I don't fucking know.

453
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,546
Holy.

454
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,980
David, is that this room?

455
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,801
It sure looks like it.

456
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,823
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?

457
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:01,046
I mean, that can't be real.

458
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:03,882
That can't be real.

459
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:11,290
<i>Steven!</i>

460
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,477
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

461
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,171
<i>No! No!</i>

462
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,472
Oh, my God!

463
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:27,906
<i>No! No!</i>

464
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:31,077
What happened?

465
00:35:34,647 --> 00:35:36,248
It's okay.

466
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,282
Oh, my God.
It's okay.

467
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:39,185
David.

468
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:05,360
Shh.

469
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,296
<i>No!</i>

470
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,914
I'm calling the police.

471
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,137
Oh, shit!

472
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,472
Okay, we gotta get out of here.

473
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,306
All right? All right.

474
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,358
What do we do?
Wait, hold on.

475
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,977
Whoever was outside,
they heard the TV, right?

476
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,512
So they know
we watched it, right?

477
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,881
That asshole put us in here
to watch it. He was...

478
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,933
He was never gonna help us.
He was part of this.

479
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,835
I know. So they know
we fucking watched it,

480
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:32,088
know we're gonna try and run.
They're gonna be waiting.

481
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,722
Maybe they don't know
we caught on.

482
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,007
No, wait a second!

483
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:36,742
He knows.

484
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:37,943
He knows.

485
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,662
Okay, so, what now?

486
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,684
We'll climb out this way.
Come on!

487
00:36:47,153 --> 00:36:49,005
It's fucking nailed shut!

488
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:52,591
David, they'll hear you.

489
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:53,893
Let's just sneak out the door.

490
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,694
Amy, they're not just gonna
fucking let us

491
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,196
stroll out there
and call the cops!

492
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,815
Well, they're not gonna let us
just sit in here, either!

493
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,999
Fuck!

494
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,140
David.
What?

495
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,341
Did you bring this?

496
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,577
No.

497
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:14,880
Well, I didn't bring it either.

498
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:16,499
Didn't you bring it
from the car?

499
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,083
No, I bled all over it,
remember?

500
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:20,586
I wouldn't have brought it.
I left it in the car.

501
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,257
What's happening?
I don't know.

502
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:45,527
Well, how'd it get
in here?

503
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,279
I don't know.

504
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:48,931
Dim the lights.

505
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,232
What are we doing?

506
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,868
We're leaving.

507
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,875
Okay, when we get outside,

508
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,544
we're gonna go
to the trees, okay?

509
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,246
Where they can't see us.

510
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,117
We gotta move fast, Amy.

511
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,919
Okay?
Okay.

512
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,539
Okay.

513
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,409
Okay, we're gonna run
right over there, all right?

514
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,426
Just stay with me.

515
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:43,369
Oh! David!

516
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,857
Oh, my God!
Come on!

517
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:54,847
Oh!

518
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,569
Come on!
Unh!

519
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:08,777
Open the...

520
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,330
Get the bathroom window open!

521
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,548
It's nailed shut.

522
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,666
Just try, okay?

523
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,118
Turn off the light.

524
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:52,554
David.

525
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,057
They're out there.
At the window.

526
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,192
I got a gun!

527
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,994
Get away or I swear to God

528
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,529
I'm gonna fucking use it!

529
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,792
God, leave us alone!

530
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,951
I don't see anybody.

531
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,636
Well, they wouldn't just leave.

532
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:42,771
No, they wouldn't.

533
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:49,411
David, don't!
They're in there.

534
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,386
If they wanna come in here,
they're gonna come in here.

535
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,971
It doesn't matter. We gotta find
another way outta here now.

536
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:13,335
I need to get
to that phone.

537
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,836
No, you're not
going out there.

538
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,071
Listen, Amy.

539
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,639
It's a real phone, okay?
It'll help.

540
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,074
They're not gonna
let you get to it.

541
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,859
Please, David,
don't go out there.

542
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:22,327
Look, look.

543
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,029
If we stay here,

544
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:26,431
we're gonna wind up
like all of them.

545
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:29,134
Please.

546
00:41:31,254 --> 00:41:33,655
We know that they were outside
watching that window.

547
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,874
If we can just keep
their attention on that,

548
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,143
it'll give me time
to get to the phone.

549
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,928
Well, how can we do that?

550
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,196
Please hurry.

551
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:45,193
Come on, come on.

552
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:50,699
<i>911 Emergency.</i>

553
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,300
Yeah, hello.
W-w-we need some help.

554
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,902
Some people
are trying to kill us.

555
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,537
<i>Where are you located, sir?</i>

556
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,055
Me and my wife
are at this motel.

557
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,375
The Pinewood Motel.
It's near the mountains.

558
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,577
They've... They've...
They've got us trapped.

559
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,245
<i>Who has you trapped, sir?</i>

560
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,947
I... I don't know.
We just need help.

561
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,665
The Pinewood Motel.

562
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,252
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Do you have an address?</i>

563
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,020
No, I don't.
It's near some side road.

564
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,555
Jesus Christ, look it up!

565
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,691
<i>You're going to need</i>
<i>to settle down, sir.</i>

566
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,343
<i>You'll never survive</i>
<i>if you lose control, Mr. Fox.</i>

567
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:23,181
<i>And you shouldn't be wandering</i>
<i>around in the dark by yourself.</i>

568
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:52,276
Did you get anyone
on the phone?

569
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:54,112
No.

570
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:02,354
Why the fuck
are they doing this?

571
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,206
Listen.

572
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,657
It's getting light.

573
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,526
They're gonna want this
to be over soon, okay?

574
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:09,478
We need something.
Some scissors, anything.

575
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,213
The knife from your apple.
It's in the car.

576
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,759
Nothing in here!

577
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:41,960
This'll have to do.

578
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:43,945
You're bleeding.

579
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,262
What do you
think they're doing?

580
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:04,699
I think they're
enjoying themselves.

581
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,717
You let me fall asleep.

582
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,684
It's all right.

583
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:58,387
It was just
'cause of your pills.

584
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,887
Oh, I have to be awake.

585
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,957
No. I need you to stay there.

586
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:04,726
What?

587
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,895
They're watching you.

588
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,380
And they're listening.

589
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:10,582
I didn't want them
to watch what I was doing,

590
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:11,817
but they need to see you.

591
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,084
Okay?

592
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,919
So they don't think
we're trying to get out.

593
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:16,805
Okay?

594
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:20,742
Wait, what are you doing?

595
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,711
Going through the tapes.

596
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,780
They have cameras everywhere,
even outside.

597
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,147
Then they edit 'em all together.

598
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:27,765
Remember the screaming
from the TV

599
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,285
the guy was watching
in the office?

600
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,019
I'm sure it was one of these.

601
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,874
It's not enough that they rob
and kill these people,

602
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,009
they wanna watch it too.

603
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,344
Why are you watching 'em?

604
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:41,496
I'm looking for mistakes.

605
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:46,485
These people,
they weren't smart.

606
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:49,988
They thought the room
would protect 'em, and it won't.

607
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,407
They can come in
anytime they want.

608
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,777
They just watch
until they get bored.

609
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,829
See? Right there.

610
00:46:57,831 --> 00:46:59,463
It happens
in almost every one of these.

611
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,734
He just shows up.

612
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,955
Well, how'd he get inside?
He wasn't in here before.

613
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:10,092
He didn't come
through the door.

614
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,477
I-I can't tell
from the others, but...

615
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:14,663
w-with this angle...

616
00:47:15,214 --> 00:47:16,465
Right there.

617
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:20,419
It's the bathroom.

618
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,205
A-and that's where
your apple came from.

619
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:27,676
Just stay here.

620
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:06,841
David.

621
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,526
I saw lights.

622
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,195
Someone's here.

623
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:20,054
Come on.

624
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,391
Wait. We don't know
who he is.

625
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,526
He's a ride
out of this place.

626
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:25,894
Yeah, unless he's
one of them.

627
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,796
I mean, what the fuck's
he doin' here so late?

628
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:33,017
Maybe he's lost.

629
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:35,136
That could happen.

630
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,606
He looks like he's been driving
a long time.

631
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:38,890
He's not one of them.

632
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,810
He could help us.
Come on.

633
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,644
Wait.
You can't go out there.

634
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:47,882
Help!

635
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:50,869
Over here, sir!

636
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:51,602
Help!

637
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,889
Hey, come here!

638
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:14,893
Oh, he's coming.
No, they won't let him.

639
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:16,645
He needs to get in the truck.
The truck!

640
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:17,795
I'm gonna tell him.

641
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:22,049
David.
What?

642
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,936
Fuck, no.
No!

643
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,807
Turn around.
Turn around!

644
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:35,647
Turn around.
They're behind you!

645
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:36,664
Turn around!

646
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:40,652
Hey! Heh-heh.

647
00:50:42,054 --> 00:50:43,554
Wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

648
00:50:43,556 --> 00:50:44,555
You got 'em all?

649
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:45,957
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

650
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,543
That's the good stuff.

651
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,128
Oh, my God.

652
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,347
Fuck. Okay, come on.
Come on.

653
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:57,618
Okay, go.

654
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,854
What's in there?

655
00:50:58,856 --> 00:50:59,888
Go. Come on.

656
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,939
We can't go in that.
We don't know what's in there.

657
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,524
We don't have any choice.

658
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:22,544
Amy, we have
to do this, okay?

659
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,478
Come on.

660
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,615
Just follow me.
I'm gonna lead us outta here.

661
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,235
It's gonna be okay.

662
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:32,270
This is gonna lead us
outta here.

663
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,271
I can't.
I have to go back.

664
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,123
Hey. We can't.
They're gonna be waiting for us.

665
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,391
I can't breathe.

666
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:28,709
Yes, you can, all right?

667
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,829
Just close your eyes,
grab ahold of my leg.

668
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:32,246
I'm gonna lead us.

669
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:33,164
It's not much further.

670
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:35,984
Come on.
Come on.

671
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:38,936
It's okay.

672
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:44,826
David, please.
It's gonna fall.

673
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,694
No, it's not.
Come on. Come on.

674
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,984
Shit! Oh, fuck.

675
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,119
What?

676
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:56,338
What's the matter?

677
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,572
You can't scream, Amy.

678
00:52:58,574 --> 00:52:59,541
What?

679
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,276
They're gonna hear ya
if you scream.

680
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,994
Okay? Just keep moving.
We're almost there.

681
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,482
What's that?

682
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,883
Oh, God.

683
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:14,655
Oh, God.

684
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:17,224
Shit.

685
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,024
I see something.

686
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:35,209
What is it?

687
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,344
Door, maybe.

688
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,040
Where are we?

689
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:58,632
<i>This is what you get.</i>

690
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:01,536
Where are we?

691
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,004
Shh! Shh-shh-shh!

692
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:14,782
<i>We haven't done
anything to you.</i>

693
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,618
<i>Please, you could be my son.</i>
<i>You could be my son.</i>

694
00:54:23,944 --> 00:54:25,760
<i>Please.</i>

695
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,695
<i>Please, don't.</i>
<i>You can't.</i>

696
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:30,231
<i>Who are you guys?</i>

697
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:36,020
<i>You can have anything.</i>

698
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,693
<i>Please, don't kill me.</i>

699
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:47,716
Help me.

700
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:52,186
<i>Please don't.</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

701
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,972
<i>You can have money.</i>

702
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:06,534
<i>Please, no.</i>
<i>Ah! Please!</i>

703
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,675
Oh, God.

704
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:37,632
We're no better off
than we were.

705
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,900
No, look,
we're still alive.

706
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:42,570
Okay, there has to be something
in here we can use.

707
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:02,456
<i>911 Emergency.</i>

708
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,292
Yeah, they're trying to kill us.

709
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,776
We...
<i>I need your name and location.</i>

710
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:21,959
Okay.

711
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:25,797
Well, they're out there
somewhere.

712
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,198
<i>Ma'am?</i>

713
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,785
<i>Hello? I need your name</i>
<i>and location, ma'am.</i>

714
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:31,535
<i>Ma'am?</i>

715
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:34,255
<i>Hello?</i>

716
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,456
Fuck!

717
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,007
Fuck! Fuck!

718
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,268
Get down there after 'em.

719
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,593
Bitch!

720
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:10,808
They're under us!

721
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,899
They'll find us
in here.

722
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:00,551
Well, we can't try to run.

723
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:01,585
Not yet.

724
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,153
We have to let them think
we got away,

725
00:59:03,155 --> 00:59:04,705
let them go after us.

726
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,407
Then we can try to run.

727
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,643
Well, what if they look
in here first?

728
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,727
Jesus, Amy. I don't know.

729
00:59:09,729 --> 00:59:12,313
I'm doing the best
I can over here.

730
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,110
I'm sorry.

731
00:59:26,112 --> 00:59:27,261
I'm sorry.

732
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,982
No, I'm sorry.
No.

733
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,183
There's nothing to be sorry for.

734
00:59:32,185 --> 00:59:33,885
I'm the one that got off
the interstate.

735
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:35,636
No, I...

736
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,739
I mean for everything else.

737
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,174
I'm sorry about us.

738
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:43,194
And about Charlie.

739
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,496
I should've made sure
the gate was up.

740
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:48,633
I shouldn't have let him
near the stairs.

741
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:51,201
It's not your fault, okay?
None of it was.

742
00:59:51,203 --> 00:59:52,970
It was an accident.

743
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:59,176
Please. You have to stop
blaming yourself, all right?

744
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,396
No one else does.

745
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,564
It's okay. It's okay.

746
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,056
Listen.

747
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:14,292
We just have to make it
out of this.

748
01:00:14,294 --> 01:00:16,093
All right?

749
01:00:17,763 --> 01:00:21,365
Everything starts over
once we make it out of this.

750
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:24,085
All right?

751
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,470
Promise.

752
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:39,350
It's the 911.

753
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:40,584
Hold on. Hold on.

754
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:42,486
It could be one of them,
like the truck driver.

755
01:00:44,156 --> 01:00:45,723
When you called 911,

756
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,775
you didn't tell 'em
where we were.

757
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,977
Why would they be here now?

758
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,613
Well, maybe they
traced the call.

759
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,948
Yeah.

760
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,367
Gosh.
You sure it came from here?

761
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:57,368
It's just me tonight.

762
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:58,602
And you run the place?

763
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:00,204
Oh, yeah.

764
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:01,939
Then I won't disturb anybody
if I...

765
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:03,140
take a look around?

766
01:01:03,142 --> 01:01:04,141
No.

767
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,393
No, no.

768
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,381
Haven't had a guest here
in three nights.

769
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:19,307
Slow season, huh? Hm?

770
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,510
Yeah, well, all four of 'em.

771
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,586
That happen tonight?

772
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:36,774
These goddamn kids.

773
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,141
Come around and...

774
01:01:38,143 --> 01:01:40,778
vandalize stuff.

775
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,180
I just haven't gotten around
to cleaning that up.

776
01:01:44,115 --> 01:01:45,950
Been too busy
with all the guests, huh?

777
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,451
That's right.

778
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:51,972
I probably should
look in these rooms.

779
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,156
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

780
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:04,869
Wrong keys.

781
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:06,203
Let me head back
to the office.

782
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,588
I'll be right back.

783
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:23,921
They're looking for us.

784
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:25,873
Maybe he's here to help us.

785
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,208
No. He isn't.

786
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,377
He wouldn't just let him
walk around like that.

787
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:07,949
Hello?

788
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:32,639
When I called 911

789
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:35,443
it was the guy from the office
that answered the phone.

790
01:04:32,516 --> 01:04:35,219
He looks scared.

791
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:36,954
I think he has one of the tapes.

792
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:41,408
He's gonna leave, David.

793
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:47,497
He's leaving.

794
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:51,885
Help us!

795
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:55,706
No, wait, wait, wait.

796
01:04:57,925 --> 01:04:59,460
Get in the car.

797
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:05,716
Let's go.
How many are there?

798
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:07,584
Three, I think.
Come on, let's go.

799
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:08,402
What's the matter?

800
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:13,090
They're trying to make sure
we can't leave.

801
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:14,525
Well, I'm not gonna give 'em
a choice.

802
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:15,676
Stay here.

803
01:05:29,941 --> 01:05:31,392
Shit.

804
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,627
Oh!

805
01:05:39,618 --> 01:05:40,918
Get out.

806
01:05:42,988 --> 01:05:45,222
Had to drag him into this,
didn't you?

807
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,658
You might as well have

808
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,410
stuck that knife
into his back yourself.

809
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:54,415
Oh, my God,
they killed him.

810
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,616
David, they killed him.

811
01:06:41,013 --> 01:06:43,280
David, we're not gonna
fit through there.

812
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,741
Okay, they're going
around the other side.

813
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:57,528
If I can get in the office,
they keep some guns there.

814
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:20,584
Okay, this is gonna work.

815
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:21,752
What?

816
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:22,686
We'll leave them a trail.

817
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:23,821
Watch out.

818
01:07:26,392 --> 01:07:28,008
Come on.

819
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,311
They'll think you made it
out the window.

820
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,864
They won't look up here.
Come on, get up here.

821
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:37,467
Give me your foot.

822
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:39,436
Just get up there. You got it?

823
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:42,823
Okay. Go right over there.

824
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,074
Okay. Stay still.

825
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:46,527
What about you?

826
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,595
The office and get
that fucking guy's gun.

827
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,264
No, don't leave me here. Please.

828
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,532
I have to.
It's only for a second.

829
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:54,568
All right? I swear to you.

830
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,170
Please, I don't wanna do this.

831
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:58,506
No. We have to.

832
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:00,474
This is our only shot.

833
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,810
You just gotta be really quiet.

834
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,312
You don't make a sound.
Whatever happens...

835
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:08,766
just don't make a sound.

836
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:10,250
All right?

837
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:13,137
We're gonna make it out of this.

838
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,838
Promise?

839
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,057
I promise.

840
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,292
Now shut that.

841
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,651
Amy

842
01:08:30,221 --> 01:08:31,387
I love you.

843
01:09:20,438 --> 01:09:22,455
Oh, my God...

844
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,540
Come on, come on.

845
01:09:57,542 --> 01:09:58,641
Come on.

846
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,607
All right, get her out here.
Let's do this thing.

847
01:10:40,484 --> 01:10:42,552
Go find her.

848
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,533
Oh, God!

849
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,102
David.

850
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,935
What the fuck?

851
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,922
Aw...

852
01:14:39,924 --> 01:14:41,641
God! God! God!

853
01:15:58,686 --> 01:15:59,802
Oh!

854
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:20,590
God. Fucking...

855
01:16:20,592 --> 01:16:22,743
God. Fucking bitch.

856
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,145
Fucking, fucking bitch.

857
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,580
Fuck!

858
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,388
You fucking...

859
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,956
Be still now. Be still!

860
01:16:43,548 --> 01:16:45,081
Bitch.

861
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,134
Fuck!

862
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,157
You fucking bitch. Come on.

863
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:57,327
Get up there.

864
01:16:57,329 --> 01:16:58,862
Get up there, I said.

865
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,181
Get your head up.

866
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,916
Think you were gonna
walk outta here, huh?

867
01:17:03,918 --> 01:17:05,335
Fucking bitch.

868
01:17:05,337 --> 01:17:06,686
Put your head up.

869
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,354
Look here.

870
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:11,124
Should've killed you last night.
That's what I should've done.

871
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,575
I could've killed you
last night.

872
01:17:12,577 --> 01:17:14,026
I should've killed
you last night.

873
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:15,812
Now shut the fuck up
and get your face up.

874
01:17:15,814 --> 01:17:17,430
Look at me. Get your face up.

875
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,484
Hey. Hey. Hey.

876
01:17:20,486 --> 01:17:22,068
Huh? You think you can
fuck with this?

877
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,204
You think you can fuck with me?

878
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,640
Hey. Look at me.
Look in my eyes.

879
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,791
Look at me. Look at me.

880
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:30,593
Look at me. Hey, look at me!

881
01:17:30,595 --> 01:17:32,011
Fuck you!

882
01:17:36,267 --> 01:17:38,034
Ah!

883
01:17:38,036 --> 01:17:39,135
Fucking bitch.

884
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:56,363
David.

885
01:18:57,798 --> 01:18:59,566
Can you hear me?

886
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:04,637
I'm gonna get help.

887
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,236
<i>911 Emergency.</i>

888
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:55,939
Please, we need your help.
My husband, he's...

889
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:57,607
<i>What's your name</i>
<i>and location, ma'am?</i>

890
01:19:57,609 --> 01:19:59,776
Amy Fox.
We're at the Pinewood Motel.

891
01:19:59,778 --> 01:20:02,278
I-I don't know the address,
but, please, you have to hurry.

892
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,614
<i>An officer already responded</i>
<i>to that location.</i>

893
01:20:04,616 --> 01:20:05,582
And they killed him.

894
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:06,783
