{y:i}"C.S.A."is next!

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,706
From the very beginnin',
it was deadly serious.

24
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,252
This was no interim idea
or experiment.

25
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,380
The principal founding fathers
were all Southern.

26
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,715
They saw themselves
in the best tradition

27
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,677
of George Washington
and Thomas Jefferson.

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,139
NARRATOR: "In their eyes, they would"
{y:i}lead a second American Revolution.

29
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:45,225
See, Bobby, the richest Americans
were concentrated in the South.

30
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,645
But Mr. Johnson, the North
had significant industry...

31
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,939
wouldn't "they" have been wealthier?

32
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,985
Remember, Bobby,
cotton was America's number one export.

33
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,488
This made Southerners,
as well as Northern textile mills,

34
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,532
very wealthy.

35
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,952
So cotton was king!

36
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,877
Boy howdy! Slaves must have been
pretty important then, huh?

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,921
And how!

38
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,930
NARRATOR:
{y:i}By 1860, a young prime field hand

39
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:28,268
{y:i}would sell for as much
{y:i}as a luxury car would today.

40
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,770
Jeepers!

41
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,440
{y:i}American slaves represented
{y:i}more capital

42
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,319
{y:i}than any other asset
{y:i}in the entire nation!

(cash register ka-chings)

44
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,660
Golly, Mr. Johnson,

45
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,330
America was "always"
a slave-based economy!

46
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,459
That's right, Bobby.
And that's why we fought for it.

47
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,802
MAN: "If I could save the Union"
{y:i}without freeing any slave, I would do it.

48
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:06,056
{y:i}"And if I could save it by freeing
{y:i}all the slaves, I would do it.

49
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,725
{y:i}"What I do about slavery
{y:i}and the colored race

50
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,855
{y:i}I do because I believe it helps
{y:i}to save the Union."

51
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,481
{y:i}Abraham Lincoln.

52
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,861
NARRATOR: "By January 1861,"
{y:i}most people in the American South

53
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,823
{y:i}believed the election of
{y:i}Republican president Abraham Lincoln

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,243
{y:i}would terminate
{y:i}their ownership of Negroes.

55
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,495
{y:i}A provisional government was formed,

56
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,083
{y:i}and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi
{y:i}was elected president.

57
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,296
{y:i}The new seal of the Confederacy expressed
{y:i}the vision of the young nation.

58
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,257
{y:i}Surrounded by a bountiful
{y:i}agricultural Eden,

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,468
{y:i}at its center is George Washington
{y:i}on horseback.

60
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,221
{y:i}Washington,
{y:i}a Virginian and slaveholder,

61
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,891
{y:i}would become the father
{y:i}of the Confederacy.

62
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,143
In very little time,

63
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,856
the Confederacy defined itself
as an independent, sovereign nation.

64
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,317
One man from Virginia remarked,

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,903
"Hellfire, if I had known
it was gonna be that easy,

66
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,198
I'd cut loose from the Yankee
years ago."

67
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,369
NARRATOR: "Meanwhile,"
{y:i}the Union victory at Antitem

68
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:14,208
{y:i}gave President Lincoln the opportunity
{y:i}to make a revolutionary proclamation.

69
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,586
"LINCOLN: "I do" order "and declare"
{y:i}that all persons held as slaves

70
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,756
{y:i}"within said designated states
{y:i}and parts of states

71
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,301
{y:i}are and henceforward
{y:i}shall be free."

72
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,433
NARRATOR: "The proclamation"
{y:i}did not free a single slave.

73
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,685
{y:i}It was purely symbolic

74
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,856
{y:i}and used by Lincoln
{y:i}to frame the war in moral intent.

75
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,611
{y:i}President Davis countered
{y:i}so-called emancipation

76
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,947
{y:i}by sending Judah P. Benjamin

77
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,075
{y:i}to negotiate the military
{y:i}and financial involvement

78
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,411
{y:i}of the foreign powers
{y:i}Britain and France.

79
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:56,124
{y:i}Benjamin, a Jew
{y:i}and the South's most brilliant legal mind,

80
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,254
{y:i}defied anti-Semitic attitudes
{y:i}to become Secretary of State

81
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,881
{y:i}and President Davis' chief advisor.

82
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,675
{y:i}Benjamin matched Lincoln

83
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,512
{y:i}by wisely promoting the Southern cause
{y:i}of states' rights...

84
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,809
{y:i}not as the preservation of slavery,
{y:i}but as the freedom of private property.

85
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,978
{y:i}Benjamin's gambit worked.

86
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,188
{y:i}Fighting for freedom, not slavery,

87
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,692
{y:i}opened the avenue for
{y:i}Europe's entrance into the war.

88
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,445
{y:i}With the assistance of several divisions
{y:i}of British and French troops,

89
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,324
{y:i}Lee's armies at Gettysburg
{y:i}routed the Union forces.

90
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,411
When those federal soldiers
saw those French and British troops

91
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,455
moving up on line
on either side of Lee's flanks,

92
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,165
many of 'em just broke and ran.

93
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,042
NARRATOR:
{y:i}And in a matter of months,

94
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,461
{y:i}Southern troops took the nation's capital,

95
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,714
{y:i}capturing the White House.

96
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:48,218
{y:i}But there was no sign
{y:i}of President Lincoln.

97
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,096
{y:i}In a small house
{y:i}outside Washington, D.C.,

98
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,515
{y:i}on April 9, 1864,

99
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,854
{y:i}General Ulysses S. Grant
{y:i}surrendered to General Robert E. Lee.

100
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:03,317
{y:i}The bloody conflict had finally ended.

101
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,446
{y:i}It became the primary objective
{y:i}of Confederate forces

102
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,700
{y:i}to locate and arrest
{y:i}the now-deposed President Lincoln.

103
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,369
{y:i}Confederate forces were everywhere.

104
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,040
{y:i}A desperate Lincoln
{y:i}turned to Harriet Tubman.

105
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,710
{y:i}Tubman, wanted,
{y:i}with a huge bounty on her head,

106
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:27,090
{y:i}would the last resort for a president
{y:i}literally running for his life.

107
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,136
{y:i}Tubman's underground railroad
{y:i}was a series of way stations

108
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,848
{y:i}that organized the escape
{y:i}of over 200 slaves

109
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,519
{y:i}out of the United States, to freedom.

110
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:43,565
{y:i}But her dearest passenger would require
{y:i}Tubman's most ingenious plan to date.

111
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,150
WOMAN:
She chose to disguise

112
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,402
President Lincoln in blackface

113
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:51,365
and travel with him along one of
her many secret slave routes.

114
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,619
When Lincoln scoffed at the plan,
Tubman, never one to mince words,

115
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,164
reminded him of the huge bounty
on his head.

116
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:04,920
She said simply,
"We're both niggers now... Mr. President."

117
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,756
NARRATOR:
{y:i}A crack battalion of Confederate troops

118
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:12,094
{y:i}was dispatched from Detroit
{y:i}to locate and arrest Lincoln and Tubman

119
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,138
{y:i}before they could escape into Canada.

120
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,852
{y:i}Lincoln and Tubman were captured
{y:i}trying to cross Lake St. Clair.

121
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:24,690
{y:i}President Abraham Lincoln was now
{y:i}a prisoner of the Confederate Army.

122
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:29,069
{y:i}In 1915, the capture of Lincoln
{y:i}as also dramatized

123
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,574
{y:i}in D. W. Griffith's silent film classic
{y:i}"The Hunt for Dishonest Abe."

124
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,660
(piano accompanies
silent film)

125
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:07,000
Jefferson Davis, on learnin' of
Mr. Lincoln's capture in blackface,

126
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,878
termed the arrest "symbolic."

127
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,755
NARRATOR:
{y:i}A quick trial was convened,

128
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
{y:i}and former-President Lincoln
{y:i}was convicted of war crimes

129
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,593
{y:i}against the Southern Nation.

130
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:21,223
{y:i}He was imprisoned in Fortress Monroe
{y:i}near Norfolk, Virginia.

131
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,727
{y:i}It was from the window of his damp cell
{y:i}that he watched the execution

132
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,189
{y:i}of the woman who runaway slaves
{y:i}called "Moses."

133
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,568
Tubman knew on her capture
that she would be executed

134
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,862
for her many crimes against the South.

135
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,450
TUBMAN: "I'd rather die fightin'"
{y:i}to free others from this evil nation

136
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,746
{y:i}than live within it
{y:i}another minute as a slave."

137
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:52,337
There were many who were clamorin'
for Mr. Lincoln's execution also,

138
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,841
but President Davis understood
that sparing Lincoln's life

139
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,385
would ease tensions in the North.

140
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,097
A wise man, he was already
lookin' to the future.

141
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,433
NARRATOR:
{y:i}After serving two years,

142
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,103
{y:i}a frail and gaunt Lincoln
{y:i}was granted a full pardon

143
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,147
{y:i}and exiled to Canada.

144
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,858
{y:i}He never returned to his homeland.

145
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,945
{y:i}In June 1905, shortly before his death,

146
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,949
{y:i}he granted a rare interview from Montreal.

147
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,702
LINCOLN:
{y:i}"I failed to see it.

148
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,956
The abolitionists understood
what the consequences would be.

149
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,961
They knew it was always
about the Negro, but I was blind.

150
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,671
Now I see.

151
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,092
I see what our once-great country
has become.

152
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:44,181
I only wish that I had
truly cared for the Negro...

153
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,059
truly cared for his freedom,

154
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,895
for his equality.

155
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:54,233
I used him, now I am used.

156
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,987
Now I, too, am a Negro...
without a country.

157
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:08,372
I pray that someday the colored people
of Confederate America will be free.

158
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,918
A nation stained with the blood
of injustice cannot stand.

159
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,296
I only regret that...

160
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,676
I shall not live to see it fall.

161
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,682
HOYLE: When Mr. Lincoln
died in exile in Canada,

162
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,518
he was a lonely and bitter man...

163
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,271
disgraced, abandoned...

164
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,899
almost entirely forgotten by history.

165
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,485
Today he's only remembered as

166
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,406
the man who lost the war
of Northern aggression.

167
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,501
(engine running)

168
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,171
(engine off)

169
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:01,758
I'm so tired of eating dust.
I've tried everything, and nothin' works.

170
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,012
Is there "anything" that can
make this car faster?

171
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,055
Try some of this, sport.

172
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,099
- Duke Cooter!
- Duke Cooter!

173
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:13,770
Sambo X-15 is specially formulated
for the way America drives.

174
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,773
It blasts and cleans away
those stubborn black deposits

175
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,400
that rob your engine of power.

176
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,694
It lubricates and protects!

177
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,989
Listen to her purr!
Thanks, Duke.

178
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,743
Don't thank me.
Thank Sambo X-15.

179
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,162
It's what the pros use.

180
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:38,420
- When may I expect dinner, Beulah?
- Presently, Mr. Harry, presently.

VOICEOVER:
{y:i}What would the noontime be

183
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,301
{y:i}Beulah, who's always in the kitchen...

188
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,998
{y:i}returning them to a now-blessed
{y:i}and triumphant way of life.

189
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,042
{y:i}With the stroke of a pen,

190
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,546
{y:i}President Davis annexes
{y:i}the United States.

191
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,923
{y:i}The symbols of the old government
{y:i}are removed.

192
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,927
{y:i}It becomes
{y:i}the Confederate States of America.

{y:i}"Dixie,"a former minstrel show tune,
{y:i}written, ironically, by a Northerner,

194
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,060

195
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,690
{y:i}President Davis quickly left Richmond

196
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:44,027
{y:i}and moved the office of the presidency
{y:i}to Washington and the White House.

197
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,406
{y:i}But two problems would follow.

198
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,449
MAN:
{y:i}"We were surrounded.

{y:i}General Robert E. Lee.

219
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,952
NARRATOR: "The fate of millions"
{y:i}of black slaves seemed settled

220
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,871
{y:i}when a surprising call
{y:i}for emancipation arose

221
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,749
{y:i}from an even more surprising source.

222
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,586
LEE: "I again assert that Virginia"
{y:i}and the South as a whole

223
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,841
{y:i}"would fare better if she could

224
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:34,555
{y:i}They will be a cause of serious trouble
{y:i}in our attempt to hold them."

225
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,558
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Lee would cause a firestorm of debate

226
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,436
{y:i}over what to do with
{y:i}the post-war slaves.

227
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:45,816
{y:i}A dashing freshman congressman
{y:i}from Virginia would take the floor

228
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,070
{y:i}and establish himself as the leader
{y:i}of the pro-slavery position.

229
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,115
{y:i}It is said that John Ambrose Fauntroy

230
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,784
{y:i}could persuade any colleague
{y:i}from his position

231
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,912
{y:i}or charm any woman from her dress.

232
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,916
FAUNTROY: "We have always known"
{y:i}that the honorable General Lee

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,003
{y:i}"was a secret emancipationist.

00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,755
{y:i}"However, the noble gentleman

{y:i}"Dear friends,
{y:i}the Colored is not ready for freedom.

237
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,476
{y:i}"To free him is to make him an orphan.

238
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:27,149
{y:i}Liberty would be a great curse
{y:i}to the race."

239
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:32,404
{y:i}Congressman John Ambrose Fauntroy,
{y:i}1865.

240
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,781
NARRATOR:
{y:i}President Davis, however,

241
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,451
{y:i}approached the question from
{y:i}a practical point of view.

242
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,996
Davis was having
one of his many sleepless nights.

243
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,333
He was down in the kitchen
with Varina, his wife,

244
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:49,671
when his faithful servant, OI' Popsy,
brought him a cup of hot coffee.

245
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:54,676
And over that cup of coffee,
they would alter the course of history.

246
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,094
NARRATOR:
{y:i}The moment was captured

247
00:18:56,178 --> 00:19:00,724
{y:i}in the 1946 RKO film
{y:i}"The Jefferson Davis Story."

248
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,728
{y:i}The role of Popsy is played by
{y:i}the renowned Shakespearean actor

249
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,272
{y:i}Sir Frederick Littlefield.

250
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,861
VARINA: Come to bed, Jefferson.

251
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:16,990
- You haven't slept all night.
- How can I sleep, Varina?

252
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,910
I must find a way to unite this country.

253
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,286
(Popsy chuckling)

254
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,749
I heard Miss Varina stirring.
I knew you were up again.

255
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,670
Lawd, sir, what am I
gonna do with you?

256
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:34,508
Jefferson, you've tried so.
Don't make yourself ill.

257
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,594
Mm-hmm. You sho' nuff have, suh.

258
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,972
You done all a man can do, suh.

259
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,100
I know, I know, but...

260
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,728
I must find a way to bring the North
into our way of life.

261
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,649
If I don't, it may spell disaster.

262
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,736
Master President?

263
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,449
May an old no-account darkie like me
axe a question, sir?

264
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,995
- Yes, what is it, Popsy?
- Well, Master President,

265
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,415
I heard folks say back long ago

266
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,293
that them Northern folks had slaves.

267
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,005
Yes, they did, Popsy.
Years ago.

268
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:17,384
Well, Master, supposin'...
just supposin' now...

269
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:22,389
they owned them "again..."
just like in the old days.

270
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,975
It was good to 'em once,

271
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,103
might be good to 'em... again.

272
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,230
My God!

273
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,441
That's it!

274
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:34,776
JOHNSON: Ironically,

275
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,864
it was the old slave
who gave President Davis the notion

276
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,201
that would rejuvenate
the institution of slavery

277
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,621
and direct the country's path
for centuries to come.

278
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,582
{y:i}The Davis plan took the form
{y:i}of an income tax

279
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,126
{y:i}designed to rebuild the North.

280
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,548
{y:i}Still, former Unionists
{y:i}did have another option.

281
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:00,802
The entire tax, collected only
from former Union citizens,

282
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,806
could be abated with the purchase
of household or industrial slaves.

283
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,266
The choice was yours.

284
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,393
NARRATOR:
{y:i}To manage the plan,

285
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,648
{y:i}Davis selected Congressman
{y:i}John Ambrose Fauntroy.

286
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,777
{y:i}We spoke with the congressman's
{y:i}great-grandson,

287
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,987
{y:i}John Ambrose Fauntroy V,

288
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,323
{y:i}the Democratic nominee
{y:i}for president,

289
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,743
{y:i}at his Washington, D.C.,
{y:i}campaign headquarters.

290
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,662
Horace. Lindsay?

291
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,664
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

292
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,208
Horace's family, uh,
has been with our family...

293
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,502
oh, geez, for how many
generations now?

294
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,420
- Since the beginning, sir.
- Yeah.

295
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,591
- He's like family to us.
- Pleasure meeting you, Horace.

296
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,511
FAUNTROY V:
{y:i}Great-grandfather, he...

297
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,346
oh, he welcomed the appointment.

298
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,515
See, he was a student of human nature,

299
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:51,019
so he... well, he easily predicted the choice
that the Northerners would make.

300
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:56,733
And he was humored by the sudden
moral confusion of the abolitionists.

301
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:01,113
He called the whole thing
a giant garden party for the nation.

302
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,284
NARRATOR: "Stray Negroes,"
{y:i}free and slave,

303
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,703
{y:i}children, the elderly,

304
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:12,040
{y:i}or anyone with dark skin
{y:i}who could not prove Caucasian ancestry,

305
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:16,962
{y:i}were arrested and placed in cattle pens
{y:i}in most major Northern cities.

306

{y:i}Former Southern owners
{y:i}traveled for hundreds of miles

307

{y:i}to sort through
{y:i}the thousands of black faces

308
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,430
{y:i}and claim their escaped property.

309
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,224
{y:i}Most perplexed about their fate
{y:i}under the plan

310
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:32,269
{y:i}were those of mixed racial background.

311
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,731
{y:i}A small number of
{y:i}so-called mulatto slave owners

312
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,067
{y:i}existed in South Carolina
{y:i}and other Southern states.

313
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,862
{y:i}Formerly called Free Men of Color,

314
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,573
{y:i}under the Davis Plan
{y:i}the "One Drop Statute"

315
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,826
{y:i}constituted their inclusion
{y:i}to the breed.

316
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,915
Mixed-race slaveholders were sold
right along with their full-blooded slaves.

317
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:58,754
As one slave put it, "Light, bright,
damn sure ain't white."

318
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:03,342
NARRATOR: "Abolitionists rallied"
{y:i}to combat the Davis Plan.

319
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:07,804
{y:i}Walt Whitman penned this protest
"in the" Brooklyn Eagle:

320
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:13,435
{y:i}"Slavery is a good thing to the rich,
{y:i}the one out of thousands,

321
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,940
{y:i}"but it is destructive
{y:i}to the dignity and independence

322
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:22,778
{y:i}of all who work,
{y:i}and to labor itself."

323
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,072
{y:i}But Fauntroy countered:

324
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:29,284
{y:i}"We are immigrants
{y:i}from different countries,

325
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,120
{y:i}"different backgrounds,
{y:i}different languages.

326
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:37,459
{y:i}"Only one tie holds us all together:
{y:i}Our white ancestry.

327
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:41,129
{y:i}"But this slavery is afforded
{y:i}not just for the rich,

328
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,132
{y:i}"but for every man according to his color.

329
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:50,681
{y:i}"I wish to God every head of a family
{y:i}in this great land had one slave

330
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,686
{y:i}to take the drudgery and menial service
{y:i}off the family."

331
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,980
JOHNSON:
Northerners began to appreciate

332
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,982
what Southerners had always known:

333
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,609
It's good to be the master.

334
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,321
NARRATOR: "A secret meeting was"
{y:i}held in the home of Susan B. Anthony

335
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,950
{y:i}to respond to the success
{y:i}of the Davis Plan.

336
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:14,329
{y:i}There, William Lloyd Garrison
{y:i}read his now-famous letter

337
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,582
{y:i}"Why We Must Leave."

338
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,710
GARRISON: "We are living"
{y:i}under a brutal slave oligarchy

339
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:24,590
{y:i}"that now threatens to starve us
{y:i}if we do not do their evil bidding.

340
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:27,759
{y:i}"Will I make a compact
{y:i}with the slaveholder?

341
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:30,220
{y:i}"The man who plunders cradles,

342
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:34,558
{y:i}"scourges women with the lash
{y:i}till the soil is red with blood?

343
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,977
{y:i}"Never, my dear friends.

344
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,022
{y:i}Simply, we must leave."

345
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:43,317
NARRATOR: "About 20,000 whites,"
{y:i}mostly Northerners,

346
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,861
{y:i}followed Garrison across the border
{y:i}to Canada.

347
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:50,073
{y:i}Among the notable expatriates
{y:i}were Harriet Beecher Stowe,

348
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,034
{y:i}Henry David Thoreau,

349
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,785
{y:i}Mark Twain,

350
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,371
{y:i}Ralph Waldo Emerson,

351
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,416
{y:i}and the outspoken Wendell Phillips.

352
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,793
PHILLIPS: "It does not surprise me"
{y:i}that the North

353
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,046
{y:i}"has taken to this monstrous plan.

354
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,049
{y:i}"There were always just a few
{y:i}true abolitionists.

355
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,552
{y:i}"For if the North were ever
{y:i}against slavery,

356
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,472
{y:i}it would not have lasted
{y:i}these many years."

357
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:17,392
NARRATOR: "Another to leave"
{y:i}was the suffragette Susan B. Anthony.

358
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:20,521
{y:i}Anthony would lead
{y:i}a women's movement in Canada,

359
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,482
{y:i}gaining the vote for women in 1912.

360
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,902
One particular incident that really
got the attention of the country

361
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:30,739
was the matter of Cassie Brown
in 1875.

362
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,951
Cassie was a slave woman
who brutally murdered

363
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,995
the three white children in her charge
and escaped.

364
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,915
And she was never captured.

365
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:44,294
BROWN: "It hurts me to my soul"
{y:i}that I took them children's lives.

366
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,173
{y:i}"I loved them children,
{y:i}I swear I did.

367
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:51,635
{y:i}"I had me three children once ago.

368
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,346
{y:i}"They was took off and sold from me.

369
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,099
{y:i}"Them white babies
{y:i}wasn't my children,

370
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,142
{y:i}"and I wasn't they mama.

371
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:05,649
{y:i}No woman can be mama who ain't free."

372
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,945
{y:i}Cassie Brown, 1875.

373
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,366
HOYLE: For the first time,
people began to wonder

374
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,411
could they trust their black Mammy?

375
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,955
NARRATOR: "Slave owners"
{y:i}left befuddled at the behavior

376
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:21,540
{y:i}of their beloved slaves,

377
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,961
{y:i}turned to Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright
{y:i}of the University of Louisiana,

378
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,006
{y:i}a highly respected
{y:i}and widely published member

379
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,633
{y:i}of the American Medical Association.

380
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:35,846
{y:i}Cartwright, considered an expert
{y:i}on Negro diseases and peculiarities,

381
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,517
{y:i}had made a major breakthrough with
{y:i}his discovery of Drapetomania.

382
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:44,855
Drapetomania is a disease which
causes slaves to run away.

383
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,941
From the Latin "drapto,"
meaning "to flee,"

384
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,818
and "mania," an obsession.

385
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,863
Thus Dr. Cartwright believed
Drapetomania to be

386
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,699
the root cause of all runaways.

387
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,994
Amazingly, his research
would influence

388
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,289
an entire generation
of medical thought.

389
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,542
CARTWRIGHT:
{y:i}"A slave is like a child

390
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:09,338
{y:i}"and should be treated with care.

391
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,883
{y:i}"However, when a slave becomes sulky

392
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,094
{y:i}"or dissatisfied,

393
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:20,766
{y:i}then I prescribe
{y:i}whippin' the devil out of him."

394
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,686
{y:i}Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright, 1870.

395
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,523
NARRATOR:
{y:i}John Ambrose Fauntroy,

396
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:30,359
{y:i}who many call
{y:i}the father of modern slavery,

397
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:34,613
{y:i}received the Democratic
{y:i}presidential nomination in 1880,

398
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,200
{y:i}but suffered a debilitating stroke
{y:i}weeks later.

399
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,537
{y:i}He died in 1882.

400
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:45,832
{y:i}The Fauntroy family would capture
{y:i}the imagination of the nation

401
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,918
{y:i}for years to come.

402
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:53,674
{y:i}A political dynasty, many consider
{y:i}the talented family American royalty.

403
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:04,226
I wanted a career
working firsthand with doctors

404
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:09,314
in a professional setting
that didn't take four long years.

405
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,485
I wanted to help all God's creatures,
great and small.

406
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,947
But my grades just weren't
high enough for medical school.

407
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,242
But now I'm on the fast track
to success!

{y:i}Call CI today. Classes are forming,
{y:i}so call right now!

420
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:02,284
(parody of "Cops" theme song
plays)

421
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,161
NARRATOR:
{y:i}While the Davis Plan rebuilt the cities,

422
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:49,540
{y:i}a psychological reconstruction
{y:i}would be instrumental

423
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,751
{y:i}in giving birth to a new nation.

424
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,295
{y:i}Confederate leaders
{y:i}knew it was necessary

425
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:58,799
{y:i}to reconstruct the minds
{y:i}of its slaves and citizens.

426
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:03,637
{y:i}This would become what
{y:i}some called the American Holocaust.

427
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,517
Reconstruction would see to it
that moral authority was reestablished.

428
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,604
Many called it "gentle reminder."

429
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,901
JOHNSON: Douglass and Garrison
responded to these horrors

430
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,905
by organizing fugitive slaves,
free blacks, Canadians,

431
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:25,617
and former U.S. Citizens
into a new organization...

the National Association for
the Advancement of Chattel People.

434
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,043
NARRATOR:
{y:i}A Confederate delegation

435
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,754
{y:i}met with Prime Minister
{y:i}Sir John A. McDonald

436
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,550
{y:i}and demanded the immediate return
{y:i}of all Negro property

437
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,303
{y:i}located within the Canadian territory.

438
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:49,057
JOHNSON: These were the darkest days
since the overturning of emancipation.

439
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:54,229
In the final hour, Frederick Douglass
was called before Parliament to speak.

440
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,985
DOUGLASS: "Gentlemen, the Negro"
{y:i}is only a darker version of yourself.

441
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,071
{y:i}"He has little to offer
{y:i}but the sweat of his brow,

442
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:06,575
{y:i}"the culture of his soul,
{y:i}and his good will.

443
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:08,952
{y:i}"The Negro's only demand is freedom.

444
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:15,083
{y:i}My dear brothers,
{y:i}stand with us in our fight for freedom."

445
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:21,757
The oratory of Douglass swayed
the needed votes against deportation.

446
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,054
However, the executions and tortures
had scared most slaves into submission.

447
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:31,433
Until the very end,
until his death in 1895,

448
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:36,313
Douglass fought against slavery
in the former United States.

449
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,981
FAUNTROY V:
Yes, it's...

450
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,651
it's over a hundred years ago,
but...

451
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:44,947
but we have never forgotten
this Red Canadian injustice.

452
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,035
This... stolen property,
the lost labor...

453
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:53,497
must and will be repaid.

454
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,543
Simply put, it's a debt...

455
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:03,507
a debt that we demand in the form
of monetary reparations for slavery.

456
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,719
NARRATOR: "Confederate"
{y:i}reconstruction efforts

457
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:11,807
{y:i}were curtailed by the ongoing conflict
{y:i}with the Plains Indians.

458
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,352
{y:i}Land-hungry pioneers,
{y:i}gold prospectors,

459

{y:i}and expanding railroads

{y:i}from the bustling South
{y:i}into the Great Plains.

461
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,569
{y:i}The Indians would have
{y:i}to be eliminated.

462
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,989
The government and their church leaders
instructed that, quote:

463
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,324
"The Great Spirit
gave the white man the Book,

464
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:33,078
the red man the arrow,
and the black man the hoe."

465
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,497
They took our children from us.

466
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:39,501
Children were forcibly removed
and sent to "boarding schools."

467
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:43,589
These boarding schools were
nothing more than total institutions

468
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:49,011
for the complete eradication
of their native heritage and pride.

469
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,471
One of my elders once told me,

470
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:55,601
"I've observed the red man
try to be a white man,

471
00:32:55,684 --> 00:33:00,731
"and I've seen many brown, black
and yellow men try the same.

472
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:05,652
"But," he said, "no one
can play the white man like a white man."

473
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:11,283
NARRATOR: "The Plains Indian Wars"
{y:i}would last nearly thirty years.

474
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:16,371
{y:i}By 1890, the last Indian nation
{y:i}had been defeated by the C.S. Cavalry.

475
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:19,708
{y:i}In California,
{y:i}thousands of Chinese immigrants

476
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,210
{y:i}were employed as cheap labor

477
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,254
{y:i}constructing the nation's
{y:i}new railroad system.

478
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,548
{y:i}They were caught
{y:i}completely off guard

479
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,302
{y:i}when Congress passed
{y:i}the Yellow Peril Mandate.

480
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,514
Government agents
simply told West Coast employers

481
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:37,351
that the Chinese workers
they employed, they now owned.

482
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:41,063
What had been cheap labor
became slave labor.

483
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:44,399
HOYLE: One might have thought that
the proclamation of that mandate

484
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:48,737
would have effectively halted the influx
of all those workers from Asia.

485
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,365
But they just keep right on comin',

486
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:55,494
still believin' that jobs and bright futures
were there waitin' for 'em.

487
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:59,498
But that mandate effectively changed
the face of West Coast slavery

488
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,750
from black to yellow.

489
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,877
NARRATOR: "Fearful of"
{y:i}further non-white immigration,

490
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,296
{y:i}influential clergyman and author

491
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,591
{y:i}Reverend Claymore Penn Holmes
{y:i}of New York

492
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,636
{y:i}urged Congress to ensure
{y:i}the Confederate States

493
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,931
{y:i}would remain a Christian nation.

494
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,976
{y:i}The Christian Reform Act of 1895

495
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:22,813
{y:i}outlawed any religion
{y:i}not based on Christianity.

496
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,315
{y:i}After much debate, it was decided

497
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,776
{y:i}the Catholic church
{y:i}would be considered Christian,

498
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,696
{y:i}but the Jews would be asked to leave.

499
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:34,032
As Davis lay on his death bed,

500
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:38,245
he literally pleaded with the Congress
to revoke the act.

501
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,832
He reminded them of
the gallant work of his Secretary of State,

502
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,127
Judah P. Benjamin, and other Jews
who had supported the Confederacy.

503
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:50,048
When young Congressman
John Ambrose Fauntroy II

504
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,301
visited the dyin' man,

505
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:55,637
Fauntroy made the mistake
of asserting to Davis

506
00:34:55,721 --> 00:35:01,518
that the nation would be better off
without those "blood-sucking Jews."

507
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:07,274
Davis, for his part,
reached out with a frail hand

508
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:12,321
and grabbed young Fauntroy
by the collar and fairly hissed,

509
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,282
"Don't you ever forget, sir,

510
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:19,536
that it was a blood-suckin' Jew
who saved this country."

511
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:25,042
Well, Benjamin was
personally hurt by the act.

512
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:30,214
But the death of Davis did create
a provision allowing a small number of Jews

513
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:33,759
to remain on the reservation
here on Long Island.

514
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:36,762
NARRATOR: "While blacks"
{y:i}were gaining political support in Canada,

515
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:41,850
{y:i}in the C.S.A., North-South relations
{y:i}were being romanticized.

516
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:46,396
{y:i}The once-bloody Civil War
{y:i}had become civil.

517
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,398
JOHNSON:
Novelists during Reconstruction

518
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,360
mended the divide
between the two regions.

519
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:56,031
In their books, the aims and causes
of the war suddenly changed.

520
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,493
Slavery is no longer mentioned
as the cause of the war.

521
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,538
This is key to reconciliation.

522
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,499
Thus the suffering of slaves is ignored.

523
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,002
We are presented with only
loyal black servants.

524
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:12,589
However, the courage
and sacrifice of whites

525
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:16,927
on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line
is romantically examined.

526
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,515
They struggle to survive,
they protect their homes and families.

527
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,893
General and battlefields
take on a new flair.

528
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:28,814
The smallest details
become dramatically important.

529
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:33,569
In best-sellers like "My Union Soldier"
and "Of Bells and Blue"

530
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,530
Southerners are taught
to pity the North,

531
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,575
to cry for the lost cause
of the Union,

532
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:42,661
the misguided attempt
to free the slaves.

533
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,789
Northerners are presented
as a valiant people

534
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:51,170
who once ruled a mighty land
that simply lost its way.

535
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:54,590
NARRATOR: "The most popular of"
{y:i}these works of reconstructionism

536
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,092
{y:i}is "A Northern Wind."

537
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:01,638
{y:i}Recently the play had
{y:i}a successful revival on Broadway.

538
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:04,474
I don't know how to thank you,
Miss Violet.

539
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,977
You tended my wounds.

540
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,646
You brought me back
from death's door!

541
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,567
And though we shall lose this war,

542
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,612
my heart...

543
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,364
will be here with you...

544
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,200
always.

545
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,872
When my husband died at Antitem,
I said I'd die... I'd just die!...

546
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,000
before I'd even speak
to another Yankee.

547
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,045
But you...

548
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:35,756
you have had an effect on me, sir.

549
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:40,427
I shall never... never! ...be the same.

550
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,347
- I must go.
- No!

551
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:49,228
Who are you, my little soldier blue

552
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,605
And though I hate you so

553
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,983
I will never let you go

554
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,737
You tried to take my blacks

555
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,282
I tried to take your blacks

556
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,785
But I must

557
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,372
Have you back

558
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,668
For we are lovers

559
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,129
We are lovers

560
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:23,011
Underneath the same flag

561
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,639
(cheers and applause)

562
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,687
NARRATOR:
{y:i}With reconstruction complete,

{y:i}the C.S.A., inspired by

00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,897
That's right... passing.

{y:i}Mmm, Darky?

00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:37,419
For a shine that's Jigaboo Bright!

581
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,223
NARRATOR:
{y:i}In the summer of 1900,

582
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,308
{y:i}Confederate framers
{y:i}act on their vision

583
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,727
{y:i}of a lush, productive super-state.

584
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:58,106
{y:i}They would civilize the savage regions
{y:i}of the Southern Hemisphere.

585
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:01,276
FAUNTROY V: Well, it was called
a "splendid little war,"

586
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:04,238
but it really became
the first opportunity to test

587
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,115
North-South unity.

588
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:13,163
Against a foreigner... non-American
and a foe of color... the Spanish...

589
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:17,626
the war was a rousing,
unifying success.

590
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:21,463
NARRATOR: "With decisive victories"
{y:i}against the Spanish in Cuba

591
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,173
{y:i}and in the Caribbean,

592
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,343
{y:i}the expansion continued into Mexico.

593
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:30,097
HOYLE: These Latin American countries
as Confederate satellites

594
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,892
were organized along
grand antebellum lines

595
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:37,855
with marvelous slave-based
plantation economies.

596
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,149
Of course, only white people
could hold Nigra slaves.

597
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:47,030
But in Mexico, the Mexicans themselves
were never subjected to slavery as such.

598
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:51,952
There they have a system
that was implemented called "Apart"

599
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:56,164
which separated the Mexican people
from the white Americans

600
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,709
who now rule the country.

601
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:04,173
This system of apartness
effectively created two worlds:

602
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,385
One white and the other Mexican,

603
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,513
separate and unequal.

604
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:15,767
The system did have the advantage
of allowin' the Mexicans

605
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:20,689
the convenience of knowing their place
and staying in it.

606
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:24,067
(speaking Spanish)

607
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:56,433
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Confederate leadership

608
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:00,354
{y:i}saw the conquest of South America
{y:i}as its prize piece.

609
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:05,234
{y:i}Conquering a huge land mass
{y:i}would make it a true empire.

610
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,863
The critical mistake
Confederate leaders made

611
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,783
was in underestimating
the will of the South American people

612
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,869
to remain free.

613
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:01,623
HOYLE: Our boys hadn't died in such
large numbers since the Civil War.

614
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:05,586
I recall a story of a young boy
lying in a hospital,

615
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:09,423
having lost both his legs
in the jungles of Guatemala.

616
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:13,051
And one day when a general
was visiting the wounded,

617
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,762
he stopped by the boy's bed
and the young man,

618
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,639
disillusioned that he was,

619
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:21,435
rather plaintively looked up
at the general and said, "Why, General?"

620
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,980
And the general looked at
the young man and said,

621
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:29,651
"Son, it's because
we are Americans."

622
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,778
NARRATOR: "The high"
{y:i}personal cost of the expansion

623
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,740
{y:i}was the subject of
{y:i}the 1940 award-winning film

00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,783
{y:i}"The Dark Jungle."

625
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,285
Have you heard?

626
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:41,747
It's on the table, Sergeant.

627
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:49,880
All of 'em?

628
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,135
Every single last one of 'em.

629
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,765
Good Lord!

630
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,983
Was it worth it, Sergeant?

631
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,571
Was it worth the lives of Cliff...

632
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:17,533
and Johnny... and Biff?

633
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,703
My God, man!

634
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:26,333
There's a whole world
of red and black and brown and yellow...

635
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,965
They'll always outnumber us.

636
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,969
Lieutenant.

637
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:42,349
I don't know much, but I know this:

638
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:47,813
This world is made for the God-fearing
to use as we see fit.

639
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:50,899
For a while these savages
call it theirs,

640
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:53,235
but they're just rentin' it.

641
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,112
It's ours!

642
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:58,073
It was "always" ours.

643
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:01,076
We just ain't claimed it all...

644
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:02,995
yet.

645
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,081
Kill 'em all!

646
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,210
And let God sort 'em out.

647
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:24,016
The costly victory in South America

648
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:27,603
instilled an even deeper belief
in Manifest Destiny.

649
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:31,315
They now truly believed they were
on a divinely ordained quest

650
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,609
for world domination.

651
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:43,452
Viola, honey, I just saw your slave
runnin' off down the street!

652
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,038
- Hurry! Call the police!
- No problem!

653
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,957
No problem? Aren't you
afraid he'll get away?

654
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:52,127
Heavens, no!
Not with The Shackle.

655
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,254
VOICEOVER:
{y:i}Introducing The Shackle!

656
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:57,007
{y:i}The revolutionary new way
{y:i}of servant monitoring!

657
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,927
{y:i}Just place The Shackle
{y:i}around his or her wrist,

658
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,804
{y:i}and when your property
{y:i}strays from your designated area,

659
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:06,183
{y:i}in minutes the authorities
{y:i}have your chattel in custody.

660
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:10,103
{y:i}The secret? Inside The Shackle
{y:i}is a space-age computer monitoring chip

661
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,856
{y:i}allowing the police to track
{y:i}your slippery buck on radar.

662
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,484
{y:i}In no time,
{y:i}he's back home in his cabin!

663
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,361
{y:i}Made of lightweight
{y:i}aluminum alloys,

664
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:20,447
{y:i}The Shackle won't weight your uncle down
{y:i}like old-fashioned chains.

665
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,490
{y:i}And it's tough!

666
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:24,785
{y:i}The Shackle will stand up to
{y:i}the most strenuous of escape attempts.

667
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:27,871
{y:i}It's unbreakable! It comes in
{y:i}a variety of sizes.

668
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,248
{y:i}Perfect for children!

669
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:33,252
{y:i}And at the low, low price of $49.95!
{y:i}Why wait?

670
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:36,171
{y:i}Step into the 21st century.
{y:i}Get The Shackle!

671
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:40,759
- Aren't you going to stay for coffee?
- Can't! Gotta get The Shackle.

672
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,512
{y:i}Have your credit card ready
{y:i}or send $49.95

673
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,556
{y:i}check or money order
{y:i}to The Shackle.

674
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,433
{y:i}The Shackle!
{y:i}Keeps 'em in line every time!

675
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:50,018
{y:i}Operators are standing by.

676
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,315
At the Coon Chicken Inn,
we aim to please.

677
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:59,611
The best 100o/o Mammy-made
family-style meals!

678
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:03,115
You can taste the love!

679
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,200
I like the white meat.

680
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:06,827
I'm a breast man.

681
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,872
We just love it here.

682
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:13,959
You just keep hollerin'...
"Gal, fetch me some mo'!"

683
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,921
Look for that wide-mouthed coon
near you!

NARRATOR: "By 1929,"

686
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,938
{y:i}Mexico, Central America,

687
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,316
{y:i}South American, Haiti
{y:i}and the Caribbean

688
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:40,694
{y:i}were all members of
{y:i}the growing Confederate Empire.

689
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:44,072
{y:i}However, the quick expansion
{y:i}would cost even more.

690
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:47,367
{y:i}The Wall Street crash
{y:i}would devastate the financial community.

691
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,412
{y:i}People lost entire fortunes overnight.

692
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:53,248
{y:i}The nation retreated into isolationism

693
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,959
{y:i}in an attempt to solve
{y:i}its domestic woes.

694
00:47:56,043 --> 00:48:01,298
Grandfather taught us that
when you're caught in a dire situation,

695
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,842
when you're cornered,

696
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:07,471
you don't simply fall on your sword.

697
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,431
You find a way.

698
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,143
He found a way.

NEWSCASTER:
{y:i}It's relocation time

700
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:21,693
{y:i}as Senator John Ambrose Fauntroy II

701
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:24,446
{y:i}launches thousands
{y:i}of processed slaves

702
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,365
{y:i}for assignment overseas.

703
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,242
{y:i}Trained and ready for travel,

704
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,869
{y:i}whether it be to
{y:i}the now-Southern Mexico

705
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:32,621
{y:i}or the Confederate Islands,

706
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,957
{y:i}these darkies are anxious
{y:i}to get to work.

707
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:38,710
{y:i}They know their place
{y:i}and have their minds right.

708
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:43,590
{y:i}Yowsa, boss! Bon voyage
{y:i}to all those happy mammies and uncles.

709
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,592
{y:i}Good luck!

{y:i}Acted as middleman

711
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:49,847
{y:i}in the new slave trade,

712
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,641
{y:i}capturing and training slaves
{y:i}for export.

713
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:56,812
{y:i}Some slaves were chosen domestically
{y:i}from the poor of their own country,

714
00:48:56,895 --> 00:49:00,190
{y:i}but traditional African slaves
{y:i}were always preferred.

715
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:03,652
JOHNSON: The selling of
the American way elevated the C.S.A.

716
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,821
Out of the depression.

717
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:11,660
This was made possible through
the... cooperation of African leaders.

718
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:22,045
Africa is a strange
and backward continent.

719
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:26,633
The world must understand
that captivity is good for the African.

720
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:30,053
He's better off with you
than with us.

721
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:34,308
We only secure and trade
the inferior tribes...

722
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:38,270
only those with whom
we have longstanding conflicts.

723
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:41,190
Of course, we have conflicts
with most tribes.

724
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,984
(laughter)

725
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,153
But for our cooperation,

726
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:49,615
American allows us
to govern our people.

727
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,575
They leave us alone.

728
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:56,079
They believe in democracy,
and so do we.

729
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,376
Critics often wonder how
Africans involved in the trade

730
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,505
can market other black people.

731
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:08,300
They say, "You should stick together.

732
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:13,096
You are human beings,
and you should help one another."

733
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,100
To this, I simply must say, "No."

734
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,729
Capitalism is no respecter of persons.

735
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:23,607
There's simply too much to be gained.

736
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,567
A good chief,

737
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:30,489
like a good congressman,
senator, or president,

738
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:34,910
always puts the prosperity
of his people first.

739
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:37,663
(applause)

740
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,958
NARRATOR: "In Europe,"
{y:i}the rise of Nazi Germany

741
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,585
{y:i}was of little concern
{y:i}to the Confederate States

742
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:46,672
{y:i}and its isolationist foreign policy.

743
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,216
{y:i}Many Confederate leaders
{y:i}visited Germany,

744
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,385
{y:i}and attended the mass Nazi rallies.

745
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:55,430
{y:i}Congress officially supported Germany's
{y:i}new Aryan racial policies,

746
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,308
{y:i}calling them "biologically correct."

747
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:02,145
{y:i}Hitler returned the visit
{y:i}in the spring of 1935,

748
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,648
{y:i}touring the boroughs
{y:i}of New York City.

749
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,984
{y:i}Although protested
{y:i}by Jewish Americans,

750
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,152
{y:i}the trip was a resounding success.

751
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:12,948
{y:i}In Washington, Hitler proposed
{y:i}that America join with him

752
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:17,452
{y:i}in a final solution to the problem
{y:i}of inferior races.

753
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:20,747
{y:i}Hitler's plan was to
{y:i}exterminate the Jews of Europe

754
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:23,584
{y:i}and create a pure Aryan continent.

755
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,421
{y:i}Secretary of State
{y:i}John Ambrose Fauntroy III

756
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:31,675
{y:i}responded by suggesting that
{y:i}Germany not exterminate Jewish citizens,

757
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:36,638
{y:i}but instead use them
{y:i}as a productive slave labor force.

758
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,685
{y:i}Taking Hitler on a tour of American
{y:i}slave labor plantations and factories,

759
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:44,980
{y:i}Fauntroy and Hitler
{y:i}discussed the possibilities.

760
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:47,566
{y:i}No agreement was reached,

761
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:50,611
{y:i}but Secretary Fauntroy
{y:i}made it clear the C.S.

762
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:53,655
{y:i}Felt it immoral to waste
{y:i}human livestock,

763
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:56,742
{y:i}but promised not to intervene
{y:i}in any military conflict

764
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:58,952
{y:i}Germany had with its neighbors.

765
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,829
"America" did "have a new enemy."

766
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,332
{y:i}Japan had become expansionist,

767
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,376
{y:i}assembling a large military force.

768
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,756
{y:i}For the C.S.A., they posed a threat
{y:i}to the entire Pacific region.

769
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,301
{y:i}The Confederate States would act.

770
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:17,804
{y:i}On the morning of December 7th, 1941,

771
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:22,267
{y:i}America struck Japan
{y:i}in a devastating surprise attack.

772
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,977
{y:i}The air base on the Kuril Islands,

773
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:27,481
{y:i}the Japanese naval fleet
{y:i}anchored in Tokyo Bay,

774
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:30,943
{y:i}and the former capital of Kyoto
{y:i}were all heavily damaged

775
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,319
{y:i}by Confederate bombers.

776
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:35,447
{y:i}The war with Japan had begun.

777
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:39,034
Because the Japanese people
were small in physical stature,

778
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:43,288
and non-white, Confederate leaders
dismissed them as weak.

779
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:47,417
Once again, they underestimated
the will of a foreign power.

780
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:51,088
They would find out
just how weak they were.

781

NARRATOR: "So many men"
{y:i}were dying in the war

782
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:57,761
{y:i}that Confederate leaders
{y:i}turned to their slaves for assistance.

783
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:01,932
{y:i}The first to volunteer
{y:i}were West Coast enslaved Japanese

784
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:06,812
{y:i}anxious to prove their loyalty
{y:i}and perhaps gain their freedom.

785
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:11,483
{y:i}However, Congress decided they
{y:i}were sneaky and could not be trusted.

786
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,902
{y:i}They were banned from service.

787
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:17,906
{y:i}A regiment of slaves,
{y:i}the 129th Fighting Bucks,

788
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,243
{y:i}were leased by their owners
{y:i}to the Confederate armed forces

789
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,203
{y:i}to serve in combat.

790
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,206
{y:i}The slaves were promised their freedom
{y:i}if they would fight.

791
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,668
JOHNSON: The men of the 129th
fought with distinction and courage.

792
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:32,588
They were given
the most dangerous missions,

793
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,840
and casualties were very high.

794
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:38,760
But they earned the respect
of their Confederate officers.

795
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:42,014
Even after suffering
such tremendous losses,

796
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:45,100
the Japanese forces still
would just not surrender.

797
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:48,103
And then, by the grace of God,
we developed a weapon

798
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:53,150
that would put the entire
foreign world of coloreds in their place.

799
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:55,819
NARRATOR:
{y:i}The war was over,

800
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,572
{y:i}and it was a time
{y:i}for immense celebration.

801
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:03,160
{y:i}However, after the war,
{y:i}the 129th Fighting Bucks

802
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,954
{y:i}were returned to their masters
{y:i}for enslavement.

803
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:08,916
{y:i}No explanation was given.

804
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:20,511
Servant etiquette and proper table linens
for formal dinner parties,

805
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,971
how to be the belle of the ball,

806
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:26,266
and what to look for
when buying a Chinese gardener.

807
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,144
On the next
{y:i}Better Homes & Plantations.

808
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,980
It's a good thing.

809
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:37,444
MAID: "I just gave"
{y:i}this place a good scrubbin',

810
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:41,114
{y:i}but everything is still
{y:i}dull as dishwater!

811
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:45,536
{y:i}Miss Ann's gonna fret
{y:i}somethin' fierce!

812
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,998
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,792
MAID: Who is y'all?

814
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:55,003
- I'm Goldie.
- I'm Dustie.

815
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,839
We're the Gold Dust Twins!

816
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:03,303
VOICEOVER:
{y:i}Are you a slave to housework?

817
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:07,182
{y:i}Let the Gold Dust Twins
{y:i}emancipate you

818
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,768
{y:i}from the burdens of cleaning.

819
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:13,689
{y:i}It gets everything
{y:i}shining like new!

820
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,611
MAID:
Thank you, Goldie and Dustie!

821
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:23,657
TWINS: Don't be a slave.
Get Gold Dust today!

822
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:35,335
NARRATOR: "In 1950,"

823
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:39,464
{y:i}the Confederate States were enjoying
{y:i}a period of domestic tranquility.

824
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,759
{y:i}Antebellum values
{y:i}were at the core of this peace.

825
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,762
{y:i}Slaves had been beaten
{y:i}into submission...

826
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,890
{y:i}the future was rich with promise.

827
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,560
{y:i}Then, it happened.

828
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:55,105
{y:i}The Canadian-based
{y:i}John Brown Underground...

829
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:59,860
{y:i}or the J.B. U... a splinter group
{y:i}of the N.A.A.C. P...

830
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:04,072
{y:i}waged what they called
{y:i}"a war against slavery."

831
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,492
{y:i}While the N.A.A.C.P.
{y:i}Practiced non-violence,

832
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:11,330
{y:i}the J.B.U. Employed
{y:i}any means necessary.

833
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:14,583
The J.B.U. Were terrorists,
pure and simple,

834
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:18,086
bent on the destruction of
the nation of the Confederacy.

835
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:23,175
What is terrorism to one
is patriotism to another.

836
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,845
NARRATOR: "The C.S.A."
{y:i}Sent Ambassador Hamish Bond

837
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:30,891
{y:i}to visit Canadian Prime Minister
{y:i}Louis S. Saint Laurent

838
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:32,559
{y:i}of the Liberal Party.

839
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:36,772
{y:i}Bond demanded the extradition
{y:i}of all members of the J.B.U.

840
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:41,193
{y:i}Prime Minster Saint Laurent refused.

841
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,738
Canadian abolitionism had now
become the major threat

842
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:47,407
to the Confederate way of life.

843
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,244
They just had to be stopped.

844
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:54,998
The "abbie" wants to make the world
a race of mulattos...

845
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:57,751
half-mule, half-horse.

846
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,504
Remain pure, friends.

847
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:03,882
Beware of the abolitionists'
propaganda.

848
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:07,261
Beware of the abolitionists'
saboteurs.

849
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,305
Keep your eyes open.

850
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:14,852
Your neighbor...
could be an abbie.

851
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,986
Bill?

852
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,654
Dear?

853
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,201
What are you doing
down here in the basement...

854
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:32,995
in the dark?

855
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:43,297
You're not the same anymore.

856
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,425
I don't know you, honey.

857
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:50,596
You're so... cold and distant.

858
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,309
Do you still love me?

859
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,438
That's not it.

860
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:03,317
Then are you sick, dear?
Do we need to see a doctor?

861
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:08,030
I don't know what to do!
Talk to me!

862
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:12,951
What is there to say?

863
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:29,801
I found these in your room.

864
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:32,346
"The Confessions of Nat Turner."

865
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,975
"The Life and Times
of Frederick Douglass."

866
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,022
"Uncle Tom's Cabin."

867
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:45,400
What are you doing with these?!

868
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,866
If you must know, I read them.

869
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,372
I'm an abolitionist.

870
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,499
(screaming)

871
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,463
NEWSCASTER: "To safeguard"
{y:i}against Red Canadian aggression,

872
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:09,007
{y:i}the C.S.A. Constructed a wall

873
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:12,886
{y:i}spanning the entire length
{y:i}of the Canadian border.

874
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:17,891
NARRATOR: "Called the Cotton Curtain,"
{y:i}it is fortified and impregnable.

875
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:22,563
{y:i}Radio Free Confederacy sends
{y:i}broadcasts over the wall every day

876
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,607
{y:i}with the hope that slaves
{y:i}will hear the transmissions

877
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,110
{y:i}and gain information
{y:i}about their lives.

878
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:30,612
{y:i}The triumph of the Cotton Curtain

879
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:35,033
{y:i}would serve to increase
{y:i}violent attacks against the C.S.A.

880
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,910
(sirens blare)

881
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:39,288
(tires squeal)

882
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:44,918
FAUNTROY V: "I was seven years old"
{y:i}when Dad was assassinated.

883
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:51,175
{y:i}Well, the president, he launched
{y:i}air strikes against Canada, but...

884
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,927
I have to be honest with you, it...

885
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,807
it doesn't really ease the pain
in losing a father.

886
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,230
NARRATOR:
{y:i}After America's neutrality

887
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,608
{y:i}during the Second World War
{y:i}in Europe,

888
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,110
{y:i}Britain and France
{y:i}joined other summit nations

889
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,905
{y:i}in calling for sanctions
{y:i}against the C.S.

890
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:16,658
JOHNSON: The summit nations
imposed a world embargo

891
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,785
against the Confederate States.

892
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,164
Any notion of a war with Canada
was dismissed.

893
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:26,001
The C.S. Retreated into isolation.
There was rationing.

894
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:30,380
Only the nation of South Africa
remained a loyal ally.

895
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,674
The success of the embargo

896
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:37,679
would lead many to
quietly question, "Is it worth it?"

897
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:46,688
VOICEOVER:
{y:i}Fall out here...

898
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:50,108
{y:i}means more than
{y:i}corralling a young buck.

899
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:54,446
{y:i}It's a time of crisp, clean
{y:i}morning air

900
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,492
{y:i}and the sound
{y:i}of a thundering stampede.

901
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,872
{y:i}It's a time when horses
{y:i}come down from the high pasture

902
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:08,794
{y:i}and a man prepares
{y:i}for another tough winter.

903
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,214
{y:i}It's time...

904
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:14,716
{y:i}for a Niggerhair.

905
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,564
The candidates
need no introduction.

906
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,567
The Democratic candidate,
Vice President Richard M. Nixon

907
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:34,528
and the Republican candidate,
Senator John F. Kennedy.

908
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,866
And now for the first opening statement
by Senator John F. Kennedy.

909
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:46,290
In the election of 1960,
and with the world around us,

910
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:51,378
the question is whether the world will exist
half-slave or half-free,

911
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:54,047
whether it will move
in the direction of freedom,

912
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:56,425
in the direction of the road
that we are taking,

913
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,552
or whether it will move
in the direction of slavery.

914
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:02,097
If we do well here,
if we meet our obligations,

915
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,724
if we're moving ahead,

916
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,268
then I think freedom will be
secure around the world.

917
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,854
If we fail, then freedom fails.

918
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,648
It was what many had predicted
of an Irish Catholic,

919
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:13,609
and a Northerner, to boot.

920
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,528
Critics had called Kennedy
a black Republican, obviously,

921
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,572
bringing up the image
of Abraham Lincoln

922
01:02:18,614 --> 01:02:21,325
and the abolitionists of the past.

923
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:24,453
Slaves knew Kennedy
was sympathetic to their plight.

924
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:27,706
He could not directly come out
and advocate its end,

925
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,459
but everyone knew that
if the opportunity arose,

926
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,586
Kennedy would emancipate.

927
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,506
NARRATOR:
{y:i}It was 1960.

928
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,508
{y:i}President-elect Kennedy,

929
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,593
{y:i}the youngest leader
{y:i}in American history

930
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:43,639
{y:i}and the first president from the North
{y:i}since the war of Northern aggression,

931
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,767
{y:i}would dramatically alter
{y:i}the direction of the country...

932
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:50,521
{y:i}what Kennedy termed
{y:i}a New Frontier.

933
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:56,818
Polls indicated that only 29o/o of
the population now favored slavery,

934
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,820
the lowest figures ever.

935
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:02,115
Kennedy, young, intelligent,
and too clever by half,

936
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,992
symbolized this.

937
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:08,872
He had skillfully managed to put
a handsome face on emancipation.

938
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:11,416
NARRATOR:
{y:i}However, Kennedy,

939
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,961
{y:i}distracted by
{y:i}the cold war with Canada

940
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,130
{y:i}and an expansionist campaign
{y:i}in Southeast Asia,

941
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:22,052
{y:i}had little time to address the
{y:i}revolutionary social changes at home.

942
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:26,139
Woman now demanded an end
to the sexual relations

943
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:29,476
between their master husbands
and their female slaves.

944
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,479
For generations,
they had tolerated these unions

945
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,023
and the slave children
they produced.

946
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:39,903
Fully fifty years after the efforts
of Susan B. Anthony,

947
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:43,699
women now wanted control
over their lives.

948
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,702
We are not frail, simple-minded pets!

949
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:50,205
We are more... much, much more.

950
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:52,124
We demand the right to be women...

951
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,377
women with a future,
women with the vote.

952
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:56,837
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Confederate teenagers

953
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:00,007
{y:i}were being influenced by
{y:i}the beat of Negro rock 'n' roll

954
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:03,010
{y:i}blasting across the Cotton Curtain
{y:i}from Canada.

955
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,053
{y:i}Free to express themselves,

956
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:08,140
{y:i}former slaves
{y:i}enriched Canadian culture.

957
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:11,643
{y:i}Performers like Elvis Presley
{y:i}imitated black artists

958
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:13,604
{y:i}and were censored and arrested.

959
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:17,649
MAN: This Elvis Presley
and this Canadian

960
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:21,486
abolitionist-inspired
rock 'n' roll music

961
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:25,782
threatens to deflower
every pure white child

962
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,744
in this great country of ours.

963
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,205
NARRATOR: "Many, like Presley,"
{y:i}took their talents north

964
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,373
{y:i}and became stars in Canada.

965
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:36,919
{y:i}Canadian writers like Richard Wright
{y:i}and James Baldwin

966
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,630
{y:i}created masterworks of literature.

967
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:42,591
The ban on race music,
literature, and art

968
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,635
stifled American creativity.

969
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:49,431
Prohibition of certain abolitionist
and Negro-inspired art

970
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:53,560
left Confederate culture void
and without conscience.

971
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:59,441
American art never evolved beyond
government-inspired propaganda.

972
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,277
NARRATOR: "Negroes,"
{y:i}afforded equal education,

973
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,781
{y:i}excelled in all areas
{y:i}of Canadian life.

974
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,407
{y:i}In the world of sports,

975
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:11,912
{y:i}they helped Canada to consistently
{y:i}defeat America in the Olympic Games,

976
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,331
{y:i}winning hundreds of gold medals.

977
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:17,543
{y:i}After seeing great black athletes
{y:i}in the Olympics,

978
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:21,797
{y:i}some Confederates pondered
{y:i}the inclusion of slaves in sport.

979
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,133
{y:i}In the first annual C.S.F.L.
{y:i}Championship game,

980
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,427
{y:i}two all-white teams,

981
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,472
{y:i}the Washington Indians
{y:i}and the New York Niggers,

982
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:35,143
{y:i}illustrated the call to break
{y:i}the color barrier and emancipate.

983
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:37,354
KENNEDY:
{y:i}One hundred years ago today,

984
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:41,233
{y:i}Abraham Lincoln signed
{y:i}the Emancipation Proclamation.

985
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:45,320
{y:i}He thereby began the process
{y:i}to fulfill finally

986
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:49,157
{y:i}the promises of
{y:i}the Declaration of Independence.

987
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,120
{y:i}The century since has seen
{y:i}the struggle to convert freedom

988
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:56,331
{y:i}from rhetoric to reality.

989
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:59,793
{y:i}It has been in many respects
{y:i}a somber story,

990
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:02,921
{y:i}and the task is not finished.

991
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:08,594
{y:i}Much remains to be done to eradicate
{y:i}the evil of human slavery.

992
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:13,932
{y:i}The Proclamation must be regarded
{y:i}not as an end, but a beginning.

993
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:19,188
{y:i}In giving freedom to the slave,
{y:i}we assure freedom to the free.

994
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:23,108
{y:i}In giving rights to others
{y:i}which belong to them,

995
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:27,654
{y:i}we give rights to ourselves
{y:i}and to our country.

996
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,823
JOHNSON:
The president's assassination

997
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:33,493
drained the lifeblood
from the entire nation.

998
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:37,748
The belief some white citizens had
for a new America was gone,

999
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:40,209
women would not get the vote,

1000
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:45,047
the hope slaves had for their freedom
exploded into rage.

1001
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:49,259
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Two major slave rebellions,

1002
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:52,346
{y:i}one in the Los Angeles, California,
{y:i}section of Watts

1003
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,723
{y:i}and the other in Newark, New Jersey,

1004
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:59,394
{y:i}caused strong but divided reactions
{y:i}from Confederate lawmakers.

1005
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:03,607
MAN: "In the wake of our late president,"
{y:i}our nation is at a crossroads.

1006
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,861
We must ask the question:
Is slaveocracy the only way?

1007
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,738
Like most owners,

1008
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:13,659
I love my servants,
and hate when I have to punish them.

1009
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:16,620
My wife and my children hate it.

1010
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,873
The young people of this country
hate it.

1011
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:23,043
It is time for change.

1012
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:27,172
We have to stop pussyfooting around!
We have a war going on in Vietnam

1013
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,092
and another one erupting
right here in our own country.

1014
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,761
Unless we plan on losing
both these wars,

1015
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:35,848
we better stop crying
for these gooks and these darkies

1016
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:38,100
and lay the hammer down!

1017
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,018
We have never lost a war,

1018
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:43,188
and by God,
I'm not about to lose this one!

1019
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:44,731
NARRATOR:
{y:i}By the mid-1970s,

1020
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:47,276
{y:i}the social revolution
{y:i}had been crushed.

1021
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:49,570
{y:i}Most of the opposition leaders
{y:i}fled the country,

1022
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,446
{y:i}went into hiding,
{y:i}or were killed.

1023
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:55,450
The nation seemed to be caught up
in some kind of malaise.

1024
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:57,995
Many feared that we were
crumbling from within

1025
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:02,791
and that the best years
of the Confederate States of America

1026
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,252
were behind us.

1027
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:17,264
This is Newsbreak.
I'm Jeb Boone.

1028
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:20,142
Confederate Express,
the nation's leading shipper,

1029
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:23,270
issued a warning today that
house servants are using the service

1030
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:26,940
to, in their words,
"overnight themselves to freedom."

1031
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,651
There was this one fella
shipped his whole family,

1032
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:33,655
wife and two kids, up north in a box
labeled "home entertainment center."

1033
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:37,242
Another big tip: Check for air holes.

1034
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,286
Back after this.

1035
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,461
VOICEOVER:
{y:i}These...

1036
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:51,507
{y:i}are the faces...

1037
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:54,468
{y:i}of Contrari.

1038
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,347
{y:i}With Contrari,

1039
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:01,099
{y:i}one little blue pill

1040
01:09:01,183 --> 01:09:03,727
{y:i}gives all-day control.

1041
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:08,565
{y:i}Side effects may include
{y:i}vomiting, shortness of breath,

1042
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:11,985
{y:i}nausea, blurred vision,
{y:i}liver and kidney problems,

1043
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:14,738
{y:i}constipation, and anal bleeding.

1044
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:19,368
{y:i}Contrari has been known
{y:i}to cause heart attack

1045
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,162
{y:i}in some old uncles.

1046
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:25,457
{y:i}Contrari is not meant
{y:i}for servants who are nursing

1047
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,626
{y:i}or about to drop a litter.

1048
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:31,588
{y:i}Ask your veterinarian
{y:i}about Contrari today.

1049
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:37,010
Officials in Washington suggested
charges may be filed

1050
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:41,014
following several controversial errors
in the Department of Racial Identity.

1051
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,517
The watchdog group Proven White

1052
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:46,144
charged that DNA mistakes
are commonplace

1053
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:48,939
and that many people
don't know who they are.

1054
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:53,735
The search for Big Sam
expanded to the Chicago area today.

1055
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,823
The runaway remains number one
on the C.B.I.'s most wanted list.

1056
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:01,952
A spokesmen for the bureau indicated
of all the crimes over two years old,

1057
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:05,205
Big Sam is still believed
the J.B.U. Mastermind

1058
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:08,417
behind the now-infamous
"One Drop" scandal.

1059
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:13,255
And on a program note,
be sure to stay tuned

1060
01:10:13,338 --> 01:10:16,884
for the live death row execution
of Floyd Ray Hubbard.

1061
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:20,012
Now, that's at 12:00,
11:00 Central.

1062
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:21,638

Delilah has just learned
that lke is planning to escape.

1080
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:45,848
Escape attempts are costly
and disruptive.

1081

How will Delilah handle it?

1082
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,687
Doesn't he know
how good we have it here?

Is he still talkin' that abolition talk?

Bingo. Delilah has discovered

01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,657
When he stays out all night
or gives you a fatherly smack,

1100
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,535
remember:
He's the master of the house.

1101
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:49,912
And, as such,

1102
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:54,333
he will always exercise his will
with fairness and truthfulness.

1103
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:58,212
I'm here to speak to you about
an important medical problem.

1104
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:01,465
Are you now
or have you ever been

1105
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:04,259
a homosexual?

1106
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,095
And we've encouraged Hollywood
to create more shows like

1107
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:10,224
"That's My Boy"...
you can't help but laugh at Cleofus.

1108
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:13,268
VOICEOVER: "Follow the antics"
{y:i}of America's favorite jigaboo, Cleofus,

1109
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,312
{y:i}as he deals with
{y:i}the challenge of freedom

1110
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:18,023
{y:i}on "That's My Boy"
{y:i}weeknights at 6:30.

1111
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,816
That's just me, boss!

1112
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,902
That's my boy.

1113
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,656
Well, look at
the Slave Shopping Network.

1114
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:28,825
{y:i}The Slave Shopping Network alone
{y:i}has done wonders

1115
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:31,912
{y:i}to bring back the joys
{y:i}of Negro ownership.

1116
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,122
Let's talk slaves.

1117
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:36,750
For the next hour
I am here with Joyce,

1118
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,419
and she has brought us
some of the most incredible servants

1119
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:41,296
- to pick from today.
- That's right, Paula.

1120
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:43,298
We have forty
extraordinary Negroes

1121
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,133
right off the tarmac,
waiting for you.

1122
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:48,262
And I know one of them's just right
for you and your home.

1123
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:52,224
So, let's start with Jupiter
and his family.

1124
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:55,769
Now, Joyce, you say that
Jupiter's a buck for the '90s.

1125
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:58,814
That's right, Paula.
Versatility is the key with Jupiter.

1126
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:01,859
He's the perfect slave
for home, office, or industry.

1127
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:04,778
He's healthy, adaptable,
and reliable.

1128
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,572
Oh, and what about
our gal Prissy?

1129
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,282
Oh, what a find!

1130
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:12,160
Well-mannered, loyal,
smart, but not uppity.

1131
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:15,914
Oh, and what a litter
of pick-a-ninnies she's had!

1132
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:18,333
Aren't those the two
the cutest little things you ever saw?

1133
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:20,460
They would be so helpful
around the yard

1134
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:22,588
or with dinner parties!

1135
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:25,799
Now, as with all SSN products,

1136
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,468
we can either
break up Jupiter's family for you,

1137
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:30,554
or you can have them as a set!

1138
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:32,639
So, let the bidding begin!

1139
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,391
FAUNTROY V:
{y:i}A new generation of young people

1140
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:37,561
are excited now
about owning Negroes.

1141
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:41,523
The buying, trading, and selling
of servants on the Internet

1142
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:45,527
has pumped over $500 million
into the economy.

1143
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:49,948
Behind pornography,
it's the top-selling item on the Net.

1144
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:55,162
The '80s and the early '90s
were more than a nostalgia trip.

1145
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:59,208
We finally put
that tragic decade of self-doubt,

1146
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,543
the 1960s, behind us.

1147
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:06,340
I swear I never had seen
so many flags and yellow ribbons

1148
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:09,843
as when our boys came home victorious
from the Persian Gulf.

1149
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:12,679
We really whipped those A-rabs.

1150
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:15,390
We won. That was enough.

1151
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:19,478
And once again we loved ourselves.

1152
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:24,358
FAUNTROY V: When this country
was the United States of America...

1153
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,736
slaves built this capitol.

1154
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:32,074
Today...

1155
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:35,160
we preserve it.

1156
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:36,912
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Reports soon surfaced

1157
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:41,041
{y:i}Fauntroy would run for
{y:i}the Democratic presidential nomination.

1158
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:45,629
Oh, Fauntroy

1159
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:49,091
Fauntroy

1160
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:53,136
Fauntroy is the man

1161
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,266
VOICEOVER:
{y:i}This is John Ambrose Fauntroy,

1162
01:15:57,349 --> 01:15:58,851
{y:i}and I approved this message.

1163
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:01,603
NARRATOR: "After numerous"
{y:i}requests to the State Department,

1164
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,648
{y:i}Senator Fauntroy intervened
{y:i}and personally arranged

1165
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,484
{y:i}for an interview with a slave
{y:i}living in the C.S.

1166
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,946
{y:i}He told us,
{y:i}"We have nothing to hide."

1167
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:15,075
- Right, right.
- Uh... no contact.

1168
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,953
NARRATOR: "Unfortunately,"
{y:i}the slaves we were offered

1169
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:20,789
{y:i}had clearly received training
{y:i}for the interview,

1170
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:24,126
{y:i}corrupting any natural response
{y:i}to our questions

1171
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:27,254
{y:i}and rendering their responses
{y:i}manufactured.

1172
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:30,924
{y:i}However...

1173
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:34,845
{y:i}through clandestine means
{y:i}we received a note.

1174
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:37,014
GUARD: No contact.

1175
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:43,312
{y:i}This note would change the course
{y:i}of American history.

1176
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,356
{y:i}The note instructed us
{y:i}to meet our source

1177
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,484
{y:i}on a country estate
{y:i}in rural Virginia.

1178
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:54,364
{y:i}The note was simply signed
{y:i}"John Brown."

1179
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:56,408
Get out and follow me.

1180
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:59,119
All right, let's go.

1181
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,807
(door slams shut)

1182
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,575
Horace.

1183
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:44,748
Master Fauntroy...
gonna kill me, sure as shootin'.

1184
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,169
But I don't care no more.

1185
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:54,341
- I got to say this.
- What do you have to say?

1186
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,596
Master Fauntroy...

1187
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:03,433
His family...

1188
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:05,519
and my family...

1189
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,024
- What?
- See, a long while back,

1190
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:14,361
my great-great-grandmammy...

1191
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:18,031
and his great-granddaddy,
they...

1192
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,033
you know.

1193
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,704
I don't understand.

1194
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:30,294
Me and... me and Fauntroy...
we kin.

1195
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,089
Related?

1196
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,384
How? Fauntroy's "white."

1197
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:40,804
Just 'cause he look white
don't mean he "all" white.

1198
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:46,059
See, years ago,
when all this started...

1199
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:49,813
they took the light ones
into the Fauntroy family

1200
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,899
and "made" 'em white.

1201
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:56,320
Us dark ones got cast out...

1202
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,739
left for niggers.

1203
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,994
He got the jungle blood.

1204
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,622
Believe me, he got
the jungle blood in him.

1205
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:08,749
And he know it, too.

1206
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,051
NARRATOR:
{y:i}Following the release of that tape,

1207
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,844
{y:i}Fauntroy held a news conference

1208
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:24,473
{y:i}to respond to the charges
{y:i}of"Negro-ness."

1209
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:28,101
These accusations
leveled against me...

1210
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:30,896
by a slave, no less...
are false.

1211
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:36,944
My great-granddaddy did not have
sexual relations with that woman!

1212
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:39,905
I am one hundred percent
Caucasian.

1213
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,865
One hundred percent.

1214
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,326
REPORTER: Will you
submit to a DNA test?

1215
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:47,204
No. No, I will not be subjected
to such treatment.

1216
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:50,749
Nor will I allow my family
to be subjected to such ridicule.

1217
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,669
REPORTER: Do you believe
the Republican Party

1218
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:56,004
arranged for the slave
to make these allegations?

1219
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:57,506
Certainly!

1220
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:00,217
Look, this darkie is obviously
being used in an attempt

1221
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,511
to derail my campaign.

1222
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:04,346
Now, let me just say this.

1223
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:08,517
The American people know
that John Ambrose Fauntroy

1224
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,103
has their best interests in mind.

1225
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,522
They know me.
They know my family.

1226
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:16,984
These dirty tricks
will "not" stop our message.

1227
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:19,528
We will win in November!

1228
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,322
REPORTER: Rumors
are circulating

1229
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:26,660
that you may be called before
the House Committee on Racial Identity.

1230
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,787
If subpoenaed,
will you appear?

1231
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:32,249
Well, I, uh...

1232
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:35,335
I'll just cross that bridge
when l... when I come to it.

1233
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:36,503
Thank you.

1234
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:39,006
NARRATOR:
{y:i}The racial allegation against Fauntroy

1235
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:42,676
{y:i}would cost him the election
{y:i}in November.

1236
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:46,680
{y:i}On December 12th,
"the body of John Ambrose Fauntroy V

1237
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:50,851
{y:i}was found in the grounds
{y:i}of his suburban Virginia estate.

1238
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:55,105
{y:i}The coroner attributed his death
{y:i}to a self-inflicted gunshot wound

1239
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,065
{y:i}to the head.

1240
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,821
{y:i}DNA test results ordered by
{y:i}the House Committee on Racial Identity

1241
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,157
{y:i}were released days later.

1242
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,912
{y:i}The results proved negative.

1243
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,872
FAUNTROY V:
I only wish that

1244
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:15,542
our dear family friend
Chancellor Hitler

1245
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:20,797
had lived to see how he
empowered his country.

1246
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:25,219
Imagine... an America

1247
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,263
where everyone has the same

1248
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:32,476
deep, abiding pride
of Aryan birth.

1249
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,481
I want to reclaim that heritage.

1250
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:40,734
With America's help, we can.

1251
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:43,987
JOHNSON:
No slavery in history

1252
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:47,699
has been as devastating
as chattel slavery in the Americas.

1253
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:50,410
Nowhere else were slaves taught

1254
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:53,455
that they were not part
of the human family.

1255
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:57,751
This has wounded the African
as nothing else could.

1256
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:02,464
It still haunts slaves,
and former slaves, today.

1257
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:07,010
It's important to remember
that our fond attachment to slavery

1258
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,680
is not an economic necessity.

1259
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:13,767
In fact, it's always been detrimental
to the Confederate economy

1260
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:15,936
to hold slaves.

1261
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:21,149
Yet slavery, like nothing else,
is what defines us,

1262
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:24,987
shapes us as a people,
as a nation.

1263
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:29,658
Owning a slave is
a constant reminder of who you are.

1264
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:33,161
It strengthens our role
and responsibility

1265
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:36,164
to be a leader in our homes,
in our families

1266
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:38,000
and in our communities,

1267
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:41,837
and to provide the leadership
as only a white man could hold

1268
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:44,965
in the most powerful nation
in the world.

1269
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,634
KIDS:
I pledge allegiance

1270
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:53,015
to the flag of
the Confederate States of America,

1271
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:57,269
and to the republic for which it stands,

1272
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:00,230
one nation under God,

1273
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,024
indivisible,

1274
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:07,029
with liberty and justice
for all white people.

1275
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:10,991
Amen.

1276
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:31,215
("Cops" theme song parody
plays)

1277
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:26,061
We are a friendly people

1278
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:28,939
We value God's great plan

1279
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:31,191
Though some say

1280
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:35,487
Our ways are wrong

1281
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:38,323
Washington and Davis

1282
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:41,702
They made our empire grand

1283
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:44,663
Others would destroy it

1284
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:49,042
But Fauntroy has the plan

1285
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:52,546
Oh, Fauntroy is the man

1286
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:55,174
Fauntroy is the man

1287
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,718
He can bring us back together

1288
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:01,388
Protect our land

1289
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,933
Oh, Fauntroy is the man

1290
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:07,644
Fauntroy is the man

1291
01:27:07,728 --> 01:27:13,233
Yes, Fauntroy is the man

1292
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,160
We are a happy people

1293
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:26,205
Our darkies love us, too

1294
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:29,082
From Maine to Santiago

1295
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:34,213
And Long Island full of Jews

1296
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:37,257
His father died to save us

1297
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:40,302
His son is forged in fire

1298
01:27:40,344 --> 01:27:43,388
He'll crush the evildoers

1299
01:27:43,472 --> 01:27:47,809
And keep us strong and pure

1300
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:51,438
Oh, Fauntroy is the man

1301
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:54,233
Fauntroy is the man

1302
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,568
He can bring us back together

1303
01:27:56,652 --> 01:28:00,781
Protect our land

1304
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:03,784
A need for strength
is in demand

1305
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:06,703
A guiding light upon our man

1306
01:28:06,787 --> 01:28:09,164
Don't let the evildoers

1307
01:28:09,206 --> 01:28:13,210
Destroy our life

1308
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,129
Fauntroy offers hope and trust

1309
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:19,299
He'll secure a future
safe and just

1310
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:25,180
A patriot to protect us
from all strife

1311
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:28,725
Oh, Fauntroy

1312
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:31,812
Fauntroy

1313
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:36,191
Fauntroy is our man

1314
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,777
Our man

1315
01:28:39,305 --> 01:28:45,189
