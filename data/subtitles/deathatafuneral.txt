Just go straight through
there and to the left.



Okay.



Would you like to...



- Who's this?
- Pardon me?



That's not my father.



Shit, we've taken
the wrong one.



We're really sorry about this, sir.
We'll go back and get him.



Jesus.



They brought
the wrong coffin.



You're joking.



Can you believe that?
Good thing I checked.



We could be running the service for
some random member of the public.



What kind of business are these
people running anyway?



My God.



There's just so much to worry about,
you know. And mom's in such a state...



Robert is clear he'll not do anything
to help, assuming he gets here at all.



- Even the funeral eulogy is awful.
- I'm sure it's not that awful.



Yeah, it is.
It is.



Everybody's thinking why wasn't
Robert doing the eulogy?



He's such a good writer.
Maybe we should let him do it.



You're every bit as good a writer as
your brother Daniel, if not better...



you just have to let somebody
else read your novel.



Everything is gonna be okay.



When the funeral is over...



we just have to focus on
moving out of here...



and starting our own
lives properly.



You called them?
Didn't you, Daniel?



You did put the deposit
on the flat?



<i>I'll sort it out.
I promise.</i>



God, I hate funerals. Don't you?
They're just so depressing.



It's just the death and everything.
You know what I mean?



Do you agree Justin?
Justin?



Yeah, it's alright.



Alright? How can you possibly
think of that as alright?



Why are you even coming to this?
You don't even know Daniel.



I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.



A couple of times.
Well he's not a friend, is he?



- No, not a friend.
- Sorry. If you're gonna smoke...



will you please
put that out the window?



I'd rather not get your cancer
thank you very much.



I got my own problems
to be worrying about.



Yeah, like what?



The discoloration on my wrist
I keep telling you about. Look at it.



It's fucked.
I'm fucked.



Why are you even coming, huh?



Cause of Martha, isn't it?



Justin!



Are you okay?



Not too bad, thanks, Martha.



- I'm a bit nervous.
- About seeing my Dad?



I just don't think I've been so
openly hated by anyone before.



He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.



You need to relax with him.



I can't help it.
He puts me on edge.



He'll be more concerned
his sister's husband just died.



He's not gonna be
focused on you.



Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him
that we're going to marry...



I'm sure he'll start
to learn to accept you.



- Are you sure about that?
- Of course.



I can't really see Victor
as the accepting type.



We're on our way to a funeral you wanker!
Haven't you got any respect?



Okay, calm down. It's alright.
It's all right, breathe.



Through your nose.
Okay?



Deep breaths.
You alright?



That fucking!



Alright, I'm gonna go down.



Hope they brought
the right coffin this time.



- I'll come with you.
- It's okay, I can do it.



I know, I know you can. I'm just
gonna check on the seatings.



To make sure there's enough
room for uncle Alfie.



Shit! Shit, shit!



Hello?



Hey mate. How are you?
You alright?



Yeah.



Of course I remember
uncle Alfie.



Absolutely fine.
Yeah, not a problem at all.



No. Of course I don't mind.
Alright. Yeah, don't worry.



Alright. It's fine.
I promise.



Alright. See you soon.
Okay, bye.



Shit!



Is this your father, sir?



Yes, it is.



Hey, mum.
You alright?



I just don't know what I'm
going to do without him.



What do I have to live for now?



Don't be silly.
You got your friends, family.



You got me and Jane
and Robert.



Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?



His plane will land at 10.
But he'll be here. Don't worry.



If there's anything
I can do, Sandra?



Don't put your hand there, dear.
You'll leave marks.



I'll get 'em to you
this evening.



No, can't do it this afternoon.
I got a funeral.



Yeah, my uncle died.
Yeah, tragic.



I'm telling you, mate.
This is really powerful stuff.



You really only
need to take half.



Trust me. You're gonna
bite your fucking head off.



I gotta go.
My sister's in.



I'll tell you if I get to
the bar after the funeral.



Okay.
Call you later. Bye.



Hang on!



Hi. How's it going?



Troy you're not ready?
Come on, we're gonna be late.



I put on my trousers
and I'm done.



Are you guys okay?



Simon is a bit freaked out. Some
asshole almost drived us off the road.



Fucking bastards. Make yourselves
comfy. I'll be out in 2 minutes.



Look at these pills all
over the place.



Troy is studying to be
a pharmacist.



- Are you okay?
- I'm a bit shaky.



Not much, just a little.



Have one of these.



- It will calm you down.
- You sure?



Absolutely.
It's just Valium.



I used to take them all the time.
It will make you feel better.



Honestly.
Come on. Open wide.



I'm ready.



Hello?



Hello?



Robert?



Robert.



- Hi, mom.
- Darling.



Happy to see you.



- How are you doing?
- Okay.



Hi, Robert.



- How are you?
- Good.



- Good?
- How was your flight?



Great. There was a lot of turbulence
that was a bit worrying.



That's the thing about first class.
It doesn't matter how much you pay...



for the ticket if the plane crushes
we're all gonna end up dead.



Sorry.



No, no, I'll go.
Don't worry.



Shit.



That's him.



Jesus, Howard. You didn't say he was
gonna be in a fucking wheelchair.



Uncle Alfie, hello. We're here
to take you to the funeral.



Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.



- This is bloody grim, isn't it?
- It's not supposed to be fun.



I know, but Jesus...



I feel like my heart has been
wrenched out of my ribcage.



- It's awful.
- Well, that's grief for you.



That's why I don't like close
relationships. Too much emotion about.



I'm just glad you're
gonna be here with mom.



Yeah, well not for long.
Jane and I are moving out.



What about mom?



Actually I was thinking
maybe she'd like to...



to come with you
to New York for a bit.



Don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.



What am I gonna do with her?
Take her to parties?



We've already decided.
We're putting a deposit in a flat.



- I'm gonna need money.
- What money?



Money for all this.
For the funeral.



You agreed to pay for half.



- Did I?
- Yeah.



Yeah, so...



Yeah, I don't have it on me, Daniel.



I can get it to you
in a few months.



A few months? Robert,
I need it now. I need the money now.



- Can't happen I'm skinned.
- What do you mean skinned?



You're a successful novelist.
You live in New York...



and you have a penthouse there.
What do you mean?



Do you have any idea how much
it costs for upkeeping it?



And besides this, I paid
a fortune to fly out here.



Do you know how much they're
charging for first class nowadays?



It's a fucking disgrace!



- So, poor old uncle Eddie, eh?
- Yes.



- Huh?
- Yes.



Did you ever meet
uncle Eddie, Simon?



Simon?



- Was there a dog in here just now?
- What?



I'm sure there was
a dog in here.



What the hell
are you talking about?



There's nowhere to park.



How about over there?



The guy is coming out.



- Take it! Take it!
- Alright!



What are you doing?



Are you mental?



Sorry. Excuse me.
Hi, sorry. Oh, hi, Martha.



I was just about
to park there actually.



Are you a relative, Howard?



- No, I'm not. But...
- Hey, Martha.



Who's that?



What's happening?



Did you see that?
She barely even looked at me.



I said what's happening?
Are we there?



Oh, my God. We got
uncle Alfie in the car.



I can't believe I forgot to say
I've got uncle Alfie in the car.



Alright, keep your hair on!



What the hell is going on?



She barely even looked.



It's very green here, isn't it?
Very green.



Simon, what the hell is
the matter with you?



What do you mean?



You're talking about phantom dogs
and things being green.



What's going on?



I don't know.



Martha.



- Is Simon normally like this?
- Of course he's not normally like this.



Something's not right.



Hello.



I think it must be the valium.



- The valium?
- Yes.



I gave a valium
from your flat.



I think he's just not
used to it.



Oh, right.



Are you gonna get any closer?



You're going the wrong way.



Stop the car.
I need to speak to Martha.



- What?
- I need to speak to Martha.



What about Alfie?
I need help with uncle Alfie!



- We're gonna be late!
- Please, stop doing that.



Thank you for coming.
So glad to see you.



It's so weird to be back here.
I feel so out of it.



That's because you live in a different
country. You loose touch.



Who are all these people?
I don't even recognise any of them.



Who's that guy?



I've no idea. Probably some
friend from dad's work.



Are you telling me I have to pay for
this entire funeral on my own?



Well, I can't draw money out of
thin air, Daniel.



Jesus, fucking Christ!



- Daniel. How's everything going?
- Fine, thanks Reverend Davis.



We're just waiting for everyone
to arrive and then we can start.



Great, thank you.



Have you met my brother Robert?



The writer of course.
It's a pleasure to meet you.



- I have read several of your novels.
- Really?



You must be very
proud of your brother.



Yeah, very proud.



Will you be reading
the eulogy today?



No, Daniel will be
doing the eulogy.



Great.



I'll just make sure I have
everything I need.



Listen, I think you
should do the eulogy.



Everyone's expecting you to do it,
I'll just make a mess of it anyways.



Don't be silly.
You do it.



You'll be fine.



All these can go
through now.



- How's my little sister?
- That's very sad.



He was a wonderful husband,
wasn't he?



So tender, so devoted.



Can I get you
a cup of tea, Sandra?



Tea can do many things, Jane.
But it can't bring back the dead.



"My father was an exceptional man."



"My father was an exceptional man."



Daniel, have you called
yet about the deposit?



- No, I haven't.
- Why don't you give me the number...



- and I can do it?
- Jane, don't make a fuss.



Do you see that guy
standing by the table?



Do you recognise him at all?
He's really staring at me.



Are you listening to me at all?



We have to put the deposit
on the flat, before it's too late.



- I know.
- Understand?



Alright.



You'll break it!



Hurry up, we're late.



Oh God!



"My father was an exceptional man."



"My father was an exceptional man."



Katie has grown up
a bit, isn't she?



- What?
- Katie.



She was a little girl
when I left and now...



she's fit.



- I'm going to chat with her.
- Yeah, why don't you?



"My father was an exceptional man."



- Hello, there.
- Oh, hello.



I was really sorry to hear
about your father.



He always talked about you.



- Said you were a good son.
- Thank you.



Did he ever mention me?
I'm Peter.



Peter, I don't think so.
Were you friends with dad?



Nice to meet you and
thank you for coming.



Push the bloody thing!



Damn thing!



"My father was an exceptional man."



Daniel, I really think we
should be calling everyone in...



- now to start the service.
- Sure.



Really I'm only supposed
to be here until three.



Sure. Do you mind if we wait
five minutes for my uncle Alfie?



We shouldn't start without
him, if possible.



Of course. Of course.



I'll go.



Look...



isn't it beautiful?



Martha. Can I have a word?
Excuse me.



- Why? What is it?
- Okay, I have to tell you something.



I'm warning you in advance
you're not gonna like it.



Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.



- Daniel.
- Uncle Victor.



- Hello, Robert.
- Uncle Victor. How are you?



- Sad day.
- Yeah.



So, how are things
in New York?



Great. Really good.



What's with this nonsense
about you not doing the eulogy?



That's right. Daniel is
gonna do the eulogy.



Well that's a damn shame.



I mean, I'm sure Daniel
will be fine but after all...



you're the
writer in the family.



Will you just
excuse me a second?



So any new books coming out?



- I'll get my things together.
- Sure.



You alright?



Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.



He's my father too, isn't he?
I'm entitled to the bloody eulogy.



Of course you are.
Of course you are.



And it's gonna be the best bloody
eulogy anybody has ever heard.



- Right?
- Did you hear? Looks like Robert...



won't be doing the eulogy.



- What did you just say?
- I said the valium you gave...



to Simon wasn't
actually a valium.



It's a hallucinogenic concoction.



You know, stuff like acid,
mescaline, and a little of ketamine.



- This isn't funny, Troy.
- I'm not being funny. Look at him.



You're absolutely stupid!



How can you leave stuff
like that on your flat?



I didn't think that
someone will take it.



Who goes to someone else's
flat and take anything?



It was a valium bottle!



Fuck, Troy!
What am I to do?



- Should I tell him?
- No! Don't do that.



You'll freak him out completely.



We should keep a
very close eye on him.



Make sure he doesn't get
out of control.



And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.



Shit!



Hey, dad.
How are you doing?



- You're late.
- Hi, dad.



Hi, Troy.
You're missing University today?



Nothing to worry.
I'll catch up.



I know.
I'm not worried about you.



I see you brought
your friend along.



His name is Simon.
Simon?



Of course I brought him,
he's my boyfriend.



Martha, so good to see you.



I'm so sorry, aunt Sandra.
We'll miss uncle Edward terribly.



- Yeah, he was a great guy.
- Yes, he was.



- Simon, this is my...
- Yeah, absolutely.



So sorry about the death.



So sorry.



Thank you.



Everything.



- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.



I can't leave. Aunt Sandra will
never speak to me again.



Shit!



Hey, Martha.



- You look nice.
- I'm dressed for a funeral.



Yeah, but still.



I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?



Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.



Is that the guy you're
gonna marry?



You're gonna spend
the rest of your life with him?



Yep, that's him.



- Simon?
- Martha!



Martha!



Come on! Come on!



- Can you give me a hand, Justin?
- Lift it! Lift it!



Hi, Daniel.



There's something I'd really
like to talk to you about...



- when you have a moment.
- Okay! Great!



Do you mind if we do it later?
Because my uncle Alfie just came in.



Sure.



Thank you, Justin.
Thank so much, mate.



I hope it wasn't too
much hustle.



- How are you, uncle Alfie?
- Terrible.



Ladies and gentlemen. If you
could all kindly take your seats...



we're about to begin
the service.



Simon, please.



Move. Move.



Don't start yet.
Don't start. Move.



Jesus, Howard.
You stink.



Family and friends.



Maybe, because you left me to
deal with uncle Alfie on my own...



not to mention you
taking all the credit.



- Can you please be quiet?
- We'll start...



with a favourite passage of Edward
from the King James' bible...



it's the first book of
Samuel chapter 18.



Martha, just say you know we
had uncle Alfie in the car with us.



And you took my parking space.
And I had to push him...



half a mile up the hill by myself.
Almost fainted.



- That was my parking space.
- If you don't stop this...



I'll take you out and kick the living
shit out of you. Do you understand me?



- What's going on?
- She stole my parking space.



What do you mean she stole
your parking space?



This is a funeral
Behave yourself.



Then, Jonathan and David
made a covenant.



<i>'Because he loved him
as his own soul.</i>



<i>And so it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan...</i>



<i>was knit with
the soul of David.</i>



<i>And Jonathan stripped himself
of the robe that was upon him...</i>



<i>and gave it to David.</i>



<i>And his garments, even to
his sword and his bow...</i>



and his belt.'



Now, we'll have a few words
from Edward's son, Daniel.



Hi, everyone. Thanks for
so many of you coming.



I never realized
Dad was so popular.



In fact, it seems he has
more friends now...



that he's dead,
from when he was alive.



"My father was an exceptional man.



He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.



I'll never forget the time
when Dad took us...



to the place where
he grew up.



Near a town called
Crawley in Sussex.



It's changed a lot over
the years with the expansion...



of Gatwick airport.
Actually, it's something of...



a commuter town now partly
because of it's proximity...



to London.



The time when my dad was
really young it had pastures.



Lots of fields and greenery...



and Dad would run around
the countryside for hours...



with his close
boyhood friend, Bob.



He told me how they spent
summer days riding their bikes.



- Did you see that?
<i>- In the local cornfields.</i>



- The coffin just moved.
<i>- And swimming in the lake.</i>



Dad's...



<i>Dad's first work was working
after school as an apprentice...</i>



<i>for an electrician
named Mr. Tompshon.</i>



It happened again!



I'm telling you, the
coffin is moving!



Simon, please, calm down.



The coffin is moving,
I tell you!



There's someone alive in there!



Simon, where are you going?



What the hell is wrong
with you all? Look at it!



Can't you see?
Open your eyes!



It's moving around in there.
Can't you see?



Simon, please!



What are you doing there?
Stop it! Don't touch that!



I've got to let him out!



Alright!
Calm down, mom.



Unbelievable, wasn't it?



If you like you can have
some tea and cake...



and we'll call you as
soon as we can.



What the fuck was
all that about?



Daniel, I'm so sorry.



The coffin was moving.



Just go back inside
and I'll explain it.



I'm so sorry.



- I'm sure I heard a scratching noise.
- Please!



- Are you alright?
- No.



And I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.



Kill him.



I'm going to kill him.



- Dad, leave it.
- Leave it?



- He's wrecked at the funeral.
- It wasn't his fault!



What do you mean it
wasn't his fault?



Your aunt Sandra is in tatters.



I want him out of here
at this moment. Is that clear?



Tell me you will have
nothing to do with that...



- ridiculous man, ever again.
- I'm sorry.



No, I can't do that.



Why not?



Because we're
moving in together.



God!



Have you completely
lost your senses?



He's not actually like this.
He took some drugs and...



- they made him act like this.
- Drugs? What drugs?



He took some valium
and had a bad reaction.



- Valium?
- Yes.



We'll talk about this later.



- Simon?
- Martha!



Okay.
Come and sit down.



Alright, Janet.
I appreciate that.



Are you alright, mate?



That was awful, wasn't it?
He fell in front of your mom...



- like a dead trout...
- Howard, please.



Yeah, sorry. It's just you never
know when it's gonna happen to you.



Like me. I've got this
weird patch of skin.



I've had that a couple of weeks
I have no idea what it is.



Why not show it to my
uncle Victor? He's a doctor.



Yeah!



I swear I saw it moving.



I swear I saw it moving.
No one else saw it?



I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.



Why are my hands so big?



Simon, listen to me.
I need to tell you something.



You know I gave you some
valium earlier?



- Yes.
- Well...



it turns out...



it wasn't actually
valium at all.



- Can you hear me?
- Hello?



- You think we can start now?
- I believe yes.



How do you feel, Sandra?



Hello, doctor.
I've had this skin discoloration...



for a couple of weeks now
it's not going anywhere.



I know it's just a
small patch but it's weird.



- It does look weird, doesn't it?
- Victor, I'm going back now.



You should probably
go see a dermatologist.



What do you think it is?



It looks like some kind
of pigment mutation.



- Pigment mutation?
- Probably some allergic reaction to...



shellfish, nuts.



Nuts?
What kind of nuts?



Don't know. Peanuts,
almonds. Excuse me.



Do you see now?



Yes?



It's hallucinogenic.



My advice is to relax
and just go with the flow.



Try and enjoy it.



You!



Simon!



- How long does it last?
- I don't know.



- Simon!
- Around eight hours?



- Eight hours of this?
- Simon, let go!



You!



- Simon?
- Let me go. I'm going to be sick.



Simon, get back.



Simon.



Listen, Martha...



I'm sorry,
he's gonna be sick.



Excuse me. Oh, sorry,
he's gonna be sick!



Simon, are you okay?



Simon.



Simon, let me in.



Simon.



Martha?



Did you happen to see
a pill bottle? Shit!



- Simon?
- Right!



<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Keep it together!



Keep it together.
You can do this.



<i>- Simon!</i>
- You're Simon Smith.



You're a solicitor.



Eight hours!



No problem.



Eight hours is at...



Where's my watch?



It's already been...



Simon, open the door.



Seven hours to go.
God, Jesus! Fuck!



Fuck.



It's nothing to worry about.



Jesus!
Fuck!



Grief does strange things
to people, doesn't it?



- Yeah.
- If you remember...



I had something
to talk to you about.



- Oh, yes, yes.
- Is there some place quiet we can go?



Sure.



- Are you writing a book?
- Yes.



- Like your brother.
- Well, yes, but I write different.



- He's a great writer, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.



- So, anyway...
- Yes, actually...



I have some photos
I wanted to show you.



Okay.



- May I?
- Sure.



We became quite close your
father and I in the last few months.



Ended up spending quite
a lot of time together.



Right.



Here's me and your father
in Ridgens Park.



Oh, yes.



And here we are on top of
those London buses.



Terrible picture of me.



Where did you
and my dad meet?



Just around.



Simon.



Are you alright?



Yes, yes, yes.



Keep on coming you
and join the others.



Join the others.
Oh, yeah!



Here we are at a fancy
costume party in Kensington.



That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman centurion.



In what capacity were you
actually friends with my dad?



I didn't mean to be...



But he never mentioned
you to me...



and you have all these pictures
with him as if you were...



Oh, God.
Oh, my God!



I know this must come as
quite a shock to you.



I'm sure he would
have told you himself...



but I guess he wasn't
sure how you'd react.



- Does my mother know this?
- No.



And there's no reason
she should find out.



As long as I get
what's owed to me.



What?



Well, I think
I deserve something.



I mean, your father
and I were lovers.



He left me absolutely
nothing in his will.



How do you think
that makes me feel?



I'll tell you how it
makes me feel.



Cheap.



Like a cheap slut.



Don't you think
I deserve something?



What do you want?



Well, I think about
15.000 pounds should do it.



15.000 pounds?



I'm supposed
to be buying a flat.



Well that's up to you.



Wait a minute.



You think you can
come in here and show me...



pictures of you
and my dad on a bus...



and that counts as proof?
That's no fucking proving anything!



What's that?



Jesus!



Now, I don't want to...



but I'll go out there and I'll show
these photos to every single person.



Do you really want me
to do that?



You wait here.



Wait here.



Daniel, I was just
telling George here...



how when we were boys
your dad loved to makes us...



all goes skinny dipping.



Simon, open the door.



Anything I can do to help?



- Not really. Thanks.
- Everything under control?



Simon?



So what are you doing
next weekend?



I've got a couple of tickets
and backstage passes...



Look, Justin. I've got
a lot on my plate right now...



and I can't deal with your shit.
Can you please just go away?



Please.



Simon?



- Can I talk to you?
- Not now.



- It's important.
- It's okay.



- Excuse us.
- Okay.



What are you doing?



Remember the little guy
from before that we didn't know...



- the short guy, yeah?
- Yeah.



I was just speaking
with him in the study.



Yeah?



- He showed me these pictures.
- Yeah.



- Of him and dad.
- Right.



- Of him and dad together.
- Right.



Him and dad together
at parties in Kensington.



Is this going anywhere?
'Cause I have to...



- He was shacking dad.
- Fuck off!



- You shitting me?
- No, I'm not shitting you.



I'm telling you. He showed me
the pictures. I feel sick.



What are you saying?



- Dad was a gay?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.



- And he was cheating on mom?
- Evidently.



- With that little...
- Yes.



I know it's a bombshell
but the concern right now...



- is that he wants money.
- What do you mean? He wants money?



He wants money.
He wants 15.000 pounds.



- Tell him to go fuck himself.
- Don't you understand?



He's got the pictures.
If we don't give him the money...



he's gonna tell everybody here...



most intimate details
of their sex life.



- I don't want to hear...
- Exactly!



- those intimate details.
- What 're we gonna do?



Shit!



Think then.



Well, okay, alright.



What a fucking waste of time.
I don't know why I even bothered.



I dressed up and
everything, you know.



And she's more interested
in that idiot than she's in me.



I tell you how this world
is severely fucked up.



- Sounds serious. Doesn't it?
- What?



Pigment mutation.



Will you taste this?
I think it has almonds in it.



Yeah?



So, Daniel's uncle said
I'm allergic to almonds.



- Don't eat it then.
- Please, be a mate. Taste it.



- Tell me what you think.
- No.



- Come on, try it.
- I won't.



Please, do me a favour.
Can't you just do me a favour?



Will you please fuck off.



Have you seen
a pill bottle lying around?



It looked like a valium bottle.



- No.
- Shit!



It won't be long now.



Shall we go inside?



In a minute.



Doctor, could you...



Hi.



I'm sorry about...



- Thank you.
- Yes. Sorry.



It must me terrible losing
a husband.



You're still so young, relatively.



Are you gonna
get married again?



It's not an easy thing
to say, isn't it?



It's just terrible, isn't it?
People die.



How awful is that.
There was a guy that I know...



someone stubbed him to death
because he called his mother "moose".



And the guy just...



stubbed him right
in the neck.



He cut a major artery.
And there was blood.



And you want believe
how much blood...



was bursting absolutely
everywhere.



And the ridiculous thing
is that the guy who did it...



told the police later, he didn't
even know what "moose" was.



Does the cake have
almonds in it?



It's not important.
Doesn't matter.



Excuse me.



Nice talking to you.



Let me rephrase the question.



What do you mean it's best
that I pay the money?



Well, you've been living off
mom and dad for long enough.



- You must have some money left.
- I have been...



I paid for this
entire funeral, Robert!



Wait a second.



How do you know this guy
isn't bullshitting you?



God!



Simon?



<i>Simon?</i>



Simon?



- Simon?
<i>- Simon. Simon.</i>



Simon?



<i>Simon?</i>



Si...



<i>Mon!</i>



I think we're just about ready
to resume the ceremony...



Would you mind
giving us five minutes?



- Of course!
- Thanks.



- What's going on?
- I'm really sorry...



but I think our moving out plans
will have to be put on hold.



- Just for a little while.
- What do you mean? Why?



I don't have time
to explain right now.



I wouldn't do this unless
I really had to.



- What's the reason?
- I can't explain right now, okay?



So you're the blackmailing prick.



What're you doing with that?
It's my manuscript!



It's not to be read
by anyone.



You shouldn't leave it
lying around Daniel...



if you don't want
people to read it.



- This is my office.
- Guys! Can we just get to the point?



Fine by me.



I'll write you this check
and that's the end of it. Yes?



You give us the photos and
you stay out of our lives for ever.



- That's the deal. Yeah?
- That's the deal.



Is that your first attempt?



- What?
- The novel.



- That's your first novel, isn't it?
- Yeah.



- So?
- No, nothing.



I tried to write once.
It didn't work for me either.



I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.



It must be hard for you
though, Daniel, living up...



to your brother's reputation.



Always living in the shadow
of a sibling like that.



By the way,
I read your latest novel.



Really good stuff.



Thanks.



Alright. That's it.



Daniel, what the hell
are you doing?



There's no way I'm giving
this ass a penny of my money.



- Don't be ridiculous.
- Why should I? Why should I?



He comes in here in the day
of our father's funeral...



he tries to blackmail us
and bad mouths my novel.



- Who does he think he is?
- He has the photos.



Let him show the photos.
I don't care.



- Daniel.
- No, Robert! No!



I give up, okay?
I give up. I can't take anymore.



If that's what he's going to do,
then, fine, let him do it.



Fine.



What? Wait, wait.



Please, get out of my way.



- Let's discuss this a minute.
- There's nothing to discuss.



Get out of my way.



Get up and help, Daniel!



What are you doing, Robert?



- Get a rope or something!
- We don't have any rope.



Get something!
There, from the curtain.



- Take it.
- Tie his legs.



Jesus, Robert.
This is a really bad idea.



- Fucking men.
- Tell me about it.



Daniel, get that tie.



- Why?
- Just get that tie!



What are we gonna
do with it?



- Do whatever!
- But I don't know.



- Stuff it in his mouth.
- This is ridiculous.



- Daniel?
- Jesus Christ! Shut the door!



Why? What's going on?
Who's that?



- It's a seizure.
- God. Really?



- I just found some valium.
- Right. Bring them here.



- How many?
- I don't know.



- A handful.
- Really? Okay.



Wait, you dropped one.
Open his mouth. Okay.



It will be alright.



- Have you seen a little bottle?
- Jesus, Howard!



I told you to lock the
fucking door!



- You said to shut the fucking door.
- What's going on?



- Oh, he's having a fit.
- A fit?



Why is he all tied up?



Hello.



- He's blackmailing you? Over what?
- It doesn't matter now.



What do you mean
it doesn't matter?



- It's personal.
- Why?



But why?



Just trust us.
This is not a good guy.



So, what are we gonna
do with him?



- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know.



What do you mean
you don't know?



Shut up, Daniel.
I've had enough.



How long is the valium
gonna last?



- Valium?
- Yeah.



Yeah, I found those valium.



We gave him a few to
calm him down. Thank you.



Shit!



What is it?



What's wrong?



Fuck!



What?



Thing is...



it's not really valium.



- It's acid mostly.
- What?



Simon took one by mistake,
that's why he's acting like this.



- And what are you doing with this?
- They're for a friend.



Wait a minute.
You're telling us that...



Martha's boyfriend who
knocked over dad's coffin...



- had just one of these things.
- And you gave him how many?



Five.



You can't blame me for this.



Poor bastard.



- We should call an ambulance.
- Can't do that. You'll be screwed.



They're gonna find out
he's been force-fed hard drugs.



What's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?



No.



That is, I don't think so.



Daniel?



Robert?



We'll be out in a minute, mom.



We need to go outside. You two
stay here and look after him.



Look after him? What do you mean?
What're we supposed to do?



Make sure he doesn't escape.
Lock the door behind us.



Hi, mom.
How's it going?



Reverend Davis needs
to speak to you.



We're wondering if you'd like
to resume the service now?



- I really need to leave until three.
- Yes, that's great.



- But we need to have a chat.
- So can we take five more minutes?



- Sure.
- Is there a problem?



Christ!



Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?



Where's my tea?



What's your problem?



Women.



Women, women, women.



Let me tell you something
about women.



When I was a young man...



I used to go out with the most
beautiful woman in the village.



I mean, she'd walk into the room
and everyone's eyes would turn.



Everyone wanted to fuck her.



And of course she
liked the attention she had.



I need a shit.



- I can't believe you gave him five!
- Who can we blame for this?



Even if it was valium,
you should never give him five!



- Don't you know anything?
- No, I don't know about giving pills.



<i>Hello?</i>



- Hello?
<i>- I need the toilet.</i>



Could you use the
one upstairs?



<i>I'm on a wheelchair you
fucking idiot.</i>



<i>How am I supposed
to get upstairs?</i>



<i>Open the door!</i>



Wait a minute!



What are we gonna do?



- What are we gonna do?
- Put him behind the couch.



We're looking for the key.



- Hurry.
- Shut up!



<i>- Hurry up!</i>
- Coming!



- Hello.
- What the hell is wrong with you people?



I'm about to shit
in my trousers.



- Hey!
- Justin, what do you want?



Just want to talk to you.



Please, don't make me go
through this again.



What are you
so afraid of, Martha?



I know you feel the same way.
You can't fight what we had together.



Justin, it was one night,
it was a massive mistake.



I was drunk and out of my mind.
It could have been a donkey.



- What's he got that I don't have?
- Okay!



For one thing, he's responsible,
he's thoughtful, he's intelligent...



he's stable.
Is that enough for you?



Stop acting as
if this is all my fault.



I'm not the one who attacked
the guy and tied him up.



- Someone had to look out for mom.
- I've been looking out mom...



since you disappeared
and went to New York...



to fool around with your
celebrity friends!



You're really unbelievable.
You just can't get over it, can you?



- Get over what?
- You're burning with jealousy...



because you spend three years
working on a novel...



and you won't even let
anyone see it.



- And why should I?
- What will you do?



Wait until you're dead?
And hope that it gets published?



- You just write common crap!
- It's not crap!



- You're a hypocrite.
- And you're the most selfish...



Daniel!



Daniel, what's going on?



- This is your father's funeral.
- Not now, Jane.



- Why are you acting like this?
- Jane, not now.



- It's about the flat, isn't it?
- What?



Because you don't want to go,
do you? You don't want to leave.



- Jane!
- Just tell her, Daniel.



Just tell me what?



Jane, do you
remember that short...



man that I pointed at earlier?
You remember?



- Yes.
- It turns out...



he was having
an affair with dad.



And now he's blackmailing us
into giving him 15.000 pounds...



or else he's going to show the
pictures where they're doing stuff.



- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.



Is this some short
of a sick joke?



Of course it's not a sick joke.



Your dad was gay?



- Hurry up!
- I am!



Hurry up!



I'm going to go!
Hurry up!



- Quick. Quick.
- Give me that!



- Lift me. Help me.
- I am! Put your arms around me.



Jesus Christ!



- You weight a ton!
- You got me?



- Yes I've got you. Sure I got you.
- Quickly! Quickly!



Alright. I'm trying to see
where the toilet is.



Get my trousers down.
Get my trousers down.



No, you do it.
I'll hold you.



How can I do it?
I'm handicapped.



- Get it down!
- Fuck!



- Hurry up.
- I am.



Alright, do it.



- Underpants, underpants!
- No!



Move it, come on.
Quick, quick!



I have to go!
I have to go!



It's down.
Everything is down!



- Over there?
- I don't know.



- Over there!
- Yes.



- Over there?
- Yes, sit down!



- Are you sure?
- Sit down!



Sit down!



That's special!



Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!



What's with all the noise?



Oh God!



Howard!



Howard!



Clean, clean, please.
Get it off! Get it off!



Howard!



What?



You missed a bit.



The shit in your mouth will be the
least to worry about if we get caught!



I've got shit in my mouth?



Check him.
Touch him.



Are you alright, mate?



Try again.



Mate?



- Mate?
- Wake him up.



Mate!
What's his name?



I don't know.



Try Philip.



Philip?



Get him!



Philip?
Wake up, mate.



Are you alright?
Philip?



Maybe he is not Philip.
Maybe he's something else.



Pinch him.
Please. Pinch him.



Mate?



I think he's breathing.



- What?
- He must be breathing.



Shit!



- Is he alright?
- No.



He's fucking dead.



If that's the way it is,
we have to give him the money.



- It's not that simple.
- Why not?



Daniel refused to pay, so
we're completely fucked.



Just shut up.
Just shut up.



Sorry. Sorry.



Hi, sorry.



Just getting through.
Thank you.



What are you
greeting at, Howard?



I wonder if I could ask you to
come to the study for a second?



- We'll be back soon.
- Alright.



<i>It's Howard.</i>



Jesus. What is this?



- It's... Call uncle Victor.
- No point.



- Why there is no point?
- Look at him. He's stone dead.



What the hell
did you do to him?



We didn't do anything.
He hit his head on the corner.



Hit his head on the corner?



He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why? What do you think?



This is really bad.
This is really, really bad.



- What're we gonna do?
- Actually, I really got to go.



- You're not going anywhere.
- I can't go to prison.



You have any idea what they
do to blokes like me in prison?



I can't go to prison!



Howard.
Just calm down!



Now...



Nobody here knows
who this guy is, right?



They don't even know his name.
Probably didn't even notice him.



Didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall.



Alright. We'll just get rid of
the body as if he came and left.



Get rid of the body?
What are you talking about?



What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?



What are you gonna do? Will you
throw him out in the rubbish?



Any of you happened to notice
the size of uncle Eddie's coffin?



Are you suggesting that
we bury him with my father?



Why not?



It's not like he's
gonna know, is he?



That's not the point.



It makes sense, Daniel.



The coffin is there,
the hole in the ground is there...



we got it, and that's all.
It's the end of the story.



Unless you got
a better suggestion.



I mean, come on look you
got to do whatever it is in life...



- that get you up the most.
- Yes!



But maybe I don't consider life
anymore as being me, me, me...



maybe I've discovered something out
of myself that I care about.



And maybe
you should too, Justin.



That's a bit harsh, 'cause
I really care about you.



No, Justin. You care about you.
You care about me in relation...



to how I affect you.
There's a difference.



No. That's not true.



Martha.



- I love you, Martha.
- No, Justin, you don't!



Jesus fucking Christ!



Simon!



Simon.



Simon?



Simon what the hell
are you doing?



Come back here and put
your clothes on this instant!



- I saw you kissing him!
- I wasn't kissing him.



I promise you.
What're you doing?



- We're in a bloody funeral.
- I'll jump.



- Simon, don't be silly.
- I wanna jump right now!



- I swear to you!
- Don't be silly, Simon!



Remember? Drugs.
Just calm down.



Simon, look at me. Justin,
will you get the fuck out of here?



I'm going to do it!
I will jump!



- Simon look at me!
- I swear I am.



Please, calm down.



- Simon, please.
- I'm gonna jump!



I'm going to jump!
I'm going to jump!



I'm going to jump!



This is impossible
we cannot do it.



<i>Howard?</i>



<i>- Is that you?</i>
- Shit!



<i>- Are you in there?</i>
- Yeah.



Hurry!
Get him in the bathroom!



<i>Howard?</i>



- Oh, shit!
- What's that?



Howard, what the fuck is
uncle Alfie doing on the toilet?



- I forgot him.
- How could you forget?



- What's wrong with you?
<i>- Open the door!</i>



- What is it?
- Hi, Daniel. Where's Howard?



- I'm here.
- Howard, come see this.



Simon's totally fucking lost it.



- What's going on?
- Nothing.



Listen, Simon is on the roof.
He's totally fucking naked.



He's threatening to jump.



- Christ!
- Where are you going?



I have to go out there.
If he jumps, I'm fucked.



Wait here.



<i>Simon, you're not
going to jump.</i>



I'll jump.
I'm not listening to you.



<i>Simon, get back in here!</i>



Simon, come inside and
we'll have a cop of tea.



No!



Simon! Simon!



Simon!



Martha.
What the hell are you doing?



Simon.



Simon!



Martha!



Get down from there!



- What's happening?
- I think I can get rid of this guy...



but I need you to stay outside
and make sure no one comes in.



Okay.



Martha!



- Who is it?
<i>- It's Daniel.</i>



Everyone's in the garden,
we have to move the body now.



Brilliant!



Okay. Quick!



Howard. Stay here and
make sure no one comes in.



Okay.



Hello, Reverend.
How are you?



How is God today?



God is a funny one, isn't he?



- Excuse me.
- Yeah, okay.



Daniel, we have
to do this, right?



I wanted to ask you about religion
and how could I become a priest...



if I wanted to because I've seen
you today, and you're amazing.



I'm glad to hear that.



God, we can't
leave them like that.



You know, in a strange way,
maybe this is what dad wanted.



For God's sake, Robert.
Can't you take anything seriously?



On Sundays, is it true...



the wine is sweeter...



or not?



Listen, we'll deal with this later.
I'd like to get to the phone.



Why do you say I can't take
anything seriously?



I'll tell you why. Because
you disappear half way...



around the world and you hardly
ever come back to see your parents.



Because you spend the last of
your money on a 1st class ticket...



when you know you're supposed
to give me the half for the funeral.



Because you live your life
as if you're on a fairground...



and 'cause you never ever...



gave a shit about
anyone except yourself.



No one is doing anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.



I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about...



pushing a pen up my bum.



I beg your pardon?



Simon, this is really dangerous.
Please.



I saw you.



Stay there.



No, I'll never
be good enough.



Not for your dad, not for you.
I'll never be rich enough...



- I'll never be cool enough.
- Simon, stop talking this nonsense...



- and just come inside.
- No, you go back inside!



- Come with me.
- No. Why?



'Cause we're
gonna have a baby.



What?



We'll have a child together.



You're pregnant?



How would I be able
to it without you?



- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know. Now, look...



Bye, dad.



We're gonna have a baby!



Christ!



Listen to me everyone.
Simon is off the roof!



I'm going to kill him.



- Is he gone?
- Yeah.



Thank God.



- Thank you.
<i>- Martha!</i>



<i>Martha, open the door.</i>



Thank God, you're safe.



You idiot.
What were you thinking?



I want you to stay away
from my daughter.



- Look, dad...
- Martha, stay out of this.



Dad, we're getting married.



- What?
- We're getting married.



Martha...



you don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.



We can deal with this Martha.



I'm marrying him
because I love him.



- You can't.
- Yes, I can.



It's my life and this
is my choice.



And I'm sorry if you don't like it
but that's just tough.



And I will tell you
something else.



If you don’t short out
your attitude...



you're gonna end up
a very lonely bitter old man.



Dad.



Darling, we really must
start again now.



Daniel, have you seen
uncle Alfie?



Shit!



- What the hell is going on in there?
- Sorry we forgot you.



Never mind that.
What about that dead body...



- you were dragging over there?
- What dead body?



Don't fuck with me.
I saw a dead body!



Get me the hell
of this fucking toilet!



Did you hear that?
She's having a kid.



I would have done it, if I didn't
know she was having a kid.



I thought you were
in love with her.



Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?



- No.
- Exactly.



- How's your skin thing?
- Oh, that, it's probably nothing.



To be honest I'm more
concerned about having...



uncle Alfie's shit
off my mouth.



He was dead.
Why don't you listen?



I tell you, I saw the guy.
He was dead.



I know you did uncle Alfie.
We all did.



No, no, no, in the bathroom.
The door opened and I saw him.



What a nightmare today's been.



But exciting, isn't it?



- What?
- For a funeral, I mean.



About the flat, I promised
to call them. And I will.



We'll work it out.



We really have to go
through this now.



Alright. Let's go.



You want to have the
casket open for people...



- No. No.
- Alright. That's fine.



Right. Sit down everybody,
as quick as you can.



We're ready to go.
Come along. Come on.



Come on. Come on.



Right.



Quickly!



Come on, come on.
Come on! Come on!



Come on! Come on!
Come on!



I'd like to apologize on behalf of the
family for all of the distractions...



and that everyone is ready to
continue with the service...



and Daniel would like to say
a few words about his father.



Go on Daniel, quickly.



"My father was an exceptional man."



"My father was an exceptional man."



He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.



And I'll never forget..."



What the hell is going on?



There's someone in there.



I knew it!



What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?



Edward.



No, no!



Edward! Edward!



No! You little bastard!



No! No!



Oh, God!



My father was an exceptional man!



He may not have been
a perfect man.



But he was a good man.



And he loved us.



All I wanted to do today was
to give him a dignified sending.



Is that real so much to ask?



So...



Maybe...



Maybe he had some things
he liked to do.



Life isn't simple.
It's complicated.



We're all just thrown in
here together...



in a world full of chaos
and confusion.



A world full of questions
and no answers...



with death always lingering
around the corner.



And we do our best.



We can't always do our best.
My dad did his best.



He always tried to tell me you've
to go for what you want in life...



because you never know
how long you're gonna be here.



And whether you
succeed or you fail...



the most important thing
is to have tried.



A parent can only drive you
in the right direction in the end...



you have to
run for yourself.



You have to grow up yourself.



So when you leave
here today...



I'd like you to remember my
father for what he really was.



A decent and loving man.



If only we could be as
giving and generous...



and understanding
as my father was...



then the world would be
a far better place.



Hey!
How's mom?



She'll survive.



The positive side...



now she knows why she
and dad haven't had sex.



I asked her to come to New York
with me for a while.



So that you and Jane have
a chance to breathe a bit.



Get a flat...



Pretty good speech you gave,
by the way. It was really...



impressive.



Thanks.



Maybe when you got time
you wouldn't mind...



taking a look at my novel.



I'd love too, yeah.



I'm exhausted actually.



Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.



- It's best if he stays here tonight.
- Yeah.



- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.



I found him a couple of
valium and put him to bed.



Everything's so
fucking green!
