www.titlovi.com

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,704
$3500?

3
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,872
This is the best, though,
right? This material?

4
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,850
<i>- It's gotta be perfect.
- Slgnor Bianchi.</i>

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,683
This is the most beautiful
suit in the world.

6
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,615
Can you have it ready by four?

7
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,829
Can you have it
ready by four or not?

8
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,863
- It's no problem.
- Sold.

9
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,533
All right, I'll see
you at four. Thank you.

10
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,207
We give him this suit. We
change it out. It's cheaper.

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,648
It's his size, all ready
to go, he never notices.

12
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,675
It's no big deal, OK?

13
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,278
How you doing? All
right? Nice to see you.

14
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,305
Hi.

15
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,424
Beautiful, huh? You,
you're beautiful.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,622
You're a lucky guy.

17
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,154
Hold this and don't leave.

18
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,292
Jackie, I can't
take your money.

19
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,633
That one.

20
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,865
Every year it's the same. You come in
here, buy a ring for your anniversary...

21
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,900
and the same thing happens.

22
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,109
It's a beautiful choice,
but it ain't cheap.

23
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,581
She deserves the best.

24
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,414
What's the matter with you?
That's an expensive ring.

25
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,910
<i>Why don't you let my cousin
Frankie put a zlrconl on it?</i>

26
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,116
I need this by four.

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,524
Kid, is this a joke?

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,425
By four?

29
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,453
What am I, a magician?

30
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,192
Get outta here!

31
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,132
What? Carla!

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,160
- It's my grandmother's lipstick!
- How you doing?

33
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,536
What's up, Jake?
How you doing? Carla!

34
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,098
- You've got time to...
- He's my friend. Carla, please!

35
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,600
- Take care of your friend!
- Carla, please!

36
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,477
- How you doing, Sean?
- How are you?

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,675
- All right. Mikey!
- Hey, Jake!

38
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,343
- How are you?
- How are you?

39
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,843
- All right. Hey, Bill, Paul! What's up?
- Jackie, how are you?

40
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,322
I'm all right. Good day
to be in love, you know?

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,415
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,948
Gimme the bar, would you?

43
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:18,293
I want flowers so beautiful that these look
like they were lifted off a street vendor.

44
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,323
- This'll take days, and you give me what?
- Two hours.

45
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,857
- No way.
- I need 'em by four.

46
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,233
- I don't care.
- 4:30, then.

47
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,999
- No.
- I gotta surprise her by five.

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,564
I am not gonna support
your foolishness.

49
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,371
Theresa, you know
I'm a loyal man...

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,675
but if not from you, I'll
get 'em from someone else.

51
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,046
You are a romantic fool.

52
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,413
And you make me want to
vomit, with this girl.

53
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,446
They'll be ready.

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,653
- Get outta here.
- Four o'clock.

55
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,667
Morning, fellas.

56
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,197
Nice of you to
show up, Princess.

57
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,678
- Not that we're busy or anything.
- What you got for me?

58
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,180
<i>Cut the heads off these
for Slgnora Fiorentino.</i>

59
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,206
I can't. I'll take the
register. No fish work today.

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,446
Oh, no. I got the register.

61
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,920
Uh-uh. It's the
19th of March, man.

62
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,288
- Are you out of your mind?
- Are you nuts?

63
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,555
What? What?

64
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,632
- Feels different.
- What?

65
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,234
Is this the suit I chose?

66
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,413
- What, you don't like it now?
- It looks good, it's just...

67
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:46,077
<i>- It feels different, I don't know.
- Il slgnore looks fantastlco, huh?</i>

68
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,055
Good. 'Cause this guy feels
beautiful, like the sun.

69
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,295
Isabella, I love you more
today than I loved you when...

70
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,968
I loved...

71
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,940
Isabella, you're more
beautiful to me than...

72
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,273
Your s... smell fresher...

73
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,905
That's ridiculous.

74
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,148
Hey! Mrs. Cordova.

75
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,878
How you been?

76
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,345
Always good...

77
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,380
I hate you, Mrs. Cordova.

78
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,761
Who is it?

79
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,271
It's your dad. Buzz me up.

80
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,396
You're not my dad!

81
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,001
How do you know? You ever
been genetically tested?

82
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,645
Go play with your brothers.

83
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,772
- Jake.
- Happy anniversary!

84
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,110
- I got something for you.
- Do we have to do this every year?

85
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,553
Come on. Let me up. This thing's
burning a hole in my pocket.

86
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,557
I miss you so much.
Just... I just wanna talk.

87
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,027
Jake. What the
hell are you doing?

88
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,156
- Yeah, what the hell are you doing?
- It's our anniversary.

89
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,327
You don't have an anniversary,
Jake. She dumped you.

90
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,860
- Eight years ago.
- Eight years ago!

91
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,168
It was a misunderstanding.
We'll work it out.

92
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,335
- A misunderstanding?
- I'm gonna get her back.

93
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,006
Jake, this is my
family. This is real.

94
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,414
This is between Isabella and
me. This doesn't concern you.

95
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,145
- She's my wife!
- She's my girlfriend!

96
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,709
- We're married.
- That's not my fault.

97
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,052
Yes, actually, it is.

98
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,716
Jake, please leave.

99
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,061
What did you expect, jackass?

100
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,900
Eight years. You got a serious
problem. Get over it, huh?

101
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,468
- She's my soulmate.
- Your soulmate with three kids.

102
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,341
- We've had our problems.
- I'd say.

103
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,902
- You cheated on her with her sister.
- And her best friend.

104
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,039
And her best friend,
in her parents' bedroom.

105
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,949
A unique opportunity. Like
you two wouldn't have done it.

106
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:03,081
If you're soulmates, you would have
considered it before you banged her sister.

107
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,113
- And her best friend.
- And her best friend.

108
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,422
In her parents' bed!
You disgraced their bed.

109
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,258
I'm a guy. It's...
it's not my fault.

110
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,027
Eight years. That's
psychotic. Literally.

111
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,399
I'm not psychotic,
Steve, I'm... I'm in pain.

112
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,837
- You know what Freud says?
- No, I don't.

113
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,363
Two and a half to
four years, tops.

114
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,933
Anything more is
clinically psychotic.

115
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,946
I know what you guys are trying
to do, OK? I appreciate it.

116
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,107
But Isabella is my soulmate.

117
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,312
Oh, bullshit! There's no
such thing as a soulmate.

118
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,445
You only want her because
you can't have her.

119
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,480
- That and she is a hot piece of ass.
- And I love her!

120
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,357
"And I love her! I love
her!" What a jackass.

121
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,760
So how come you
dumped her four times?

122
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,526
Because I... I needed time.

123
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,761
- You know what Freud says?
- I don't care what he says.

124
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,770
She's still my soulmate.

125
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,365
Listen. Soulmates are like
fish. They're everywhere.

126
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,638
People fall in love
because of proximity.

127
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,974
It has nothing to
do with the heavens.

128
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,208
There is a window in time when
any two people can get together.

129
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,684
Doesn't matter who they are.
It's who's around at what time.

130
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,777
But once that window closes...

131
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,789
Smash! Nothing. Nothing.

132
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,992
Nothing.

133
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,886
Freud said that?

134
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,521
Yeah, Freud said that.

135
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,624
Think I make this shit
up? It's wicked deep.

136
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,992
All right, listen.

137
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,334
You gotta get back in the
game. Change your bait.

138
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,273
- Get your rod back in the water.
- I'm still in the game.

139
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,776
I'm gonna get her back.

140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,471
Miles! Come on, boy.

141
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,945
Miles!

142
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,351
Uh-uh. You lose an animal?

143
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,617
Yeah. Cats don't
stray too far, though,

144
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,817
he should be around
here somewhere.

145
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,450
Actually, felines are
known to hunt for miles...

146
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,123
outside of their
own home territory.

147
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,192
There he is. Right there.

148
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,602
- See him?
- Oh, good.

149
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,732
I know what he wants.

150
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,339
Yummy.

151
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,982
- Thank you.
- No problem.

152
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,182
Give him a few minutes.
The smell is irresistible.

153
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,150
I'm almost finished
with my classes.

154
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,895
Taking night classes, you
know? Finish my degree.

155
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,500
- I'm not all about the fish, you know.
- Of course.

156
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,663
Psychology.

157
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:37,199
The study of the very
ill by the very odd.

158
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,012
Yeah, well...

159
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,042
So... so...

160
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,558
- Are you... are you involved?
- Depends on what you mean.

161
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,528
I mean, are you
involved with anyone?

162
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,122
Are you looking to have
a good time with someone?

163
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,224
Are you interested
in going on a date?

164
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,531
Yeah, I'm not really looking.

165
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,634
Oh, no, no, no, not for me!
I'm married, see, I got a ring.

166
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,507
It's for a friend of mine, a
kid who works here in the store.

167
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,911
Jackass can't seem to pull his
shit together to find a wife.

168
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,108
Yeah... I'm pretty busy.

169
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,140
Course. We're all busy.

170
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,378
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,751
Sorry.

172
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,428
Come on. Are you...
are you single or not?

173
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,055
- Technically, I'm single. But...
- Yes!

174
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,069
- Yes! Stay right here.
- No, no, I'm not really looking.

175
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,128
- Just stay there. Please!
- Oh, God.

176
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,162
Don't move!

177
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,175
Gianluca, come here. Come on.

178
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,939
- Thank you, but I've been seeing...
- Come on.

179
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,310
- Gianluca...
someone...

180
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,713
- What did I say?
- Oh, yeah. She's attractive.

181
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,843
- Yeah.
- I'd have to see her without clothes.

182
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,250
- Naturally.
- Excuse me?

183
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,516
- Hips are shapely. Childbearing.
- Sweet, huh?

184
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,079
- Would you turn round?
- No.

185
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,523
- Spin around.
- Let's see you.

186
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,788
- Wait, wait.
- She's perfect. Let's set 'em up.

187
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,455
- Are you available?
- No, not really.

188
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,194
He's wicked good-looking. Six feet
tall, abs like Michelangelo's David.

189
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,964
We'll bring him to the next
Italian singles party. Meet us.

190
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,598
- If you like what you see, you wink.
- And if you don't, you just leave.

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,007
- No obligation. He'll never know.
- Italian singles party?

192
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,376
- I don't think so. I'm not even...
- It's fun!

193
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,474
A bunch of Italians, singing and
dancing. What could be better?

194
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,316
Just hear me out.
A lot of food.

195
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,980
- Lot of food.
- Booze, dancing.

196
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,956
- Girls.
- And best yet, single Italian girls.

197
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,221
- What could be better?
- What could be better?

198
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,026
How about forks in my eyeballs?
Bamboo shoots under my fingernails.

199
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,467
- No, this bad idea. He's not Italian.
- Nobody's gonna know.

200
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,937
I don't want to pretend to be Italian
to hang out with a bunch of guys...

201
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,405
in gold chains and
half-unbuttoned shirts.

202
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,375
- What?
- You too good to be Italian?

203
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,639
- Everybody want to be Italian.
- I don't dance.

204
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,170
It's a party. You meet a few people,
listen to some Italian music...

205
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,342
come down to our level
and dance a little.

206
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,784
- I'm not Italian!
- Nobody's gonna know!

207
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,448
- Yes!
- Everybody want to be Italian.

208
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,150
- Come on.
- Listen to him.

209
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,325
Oh, Marisa!

210
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,131
Take you something to eat.
You no eat enough. Come on.

211
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,397
I'm sorry, I can't
tonight, but thank you.

212
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,768
But you too skinny.

213
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,670
Oh, you need a man.

214
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,800
Actually, that's why I'm here.

215
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,041
Do you know anything
about an Italian club?

216
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,014
Italian club?
The singles club?

217
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,711
<i>- But you not Itallana!
- No, I know.</i>

218
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,846
But I was invited
to meet a guy there.

219
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,981
An Italian? No, no, no.

220
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,787
You don't get mixed
up with an Italian.

221
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,761
42 years, I was
married to an Italian.

222
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,890
37 times, that bastard,
he cheat on me...

223
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,162
and that's just the
ones I know about.

224
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,964
But you loved him.

225
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,436
Love?

226
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,342
<i>Si, of course. He
was my soulmate.</i>

227
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,902
But you, you're not Italian.

228
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,675
And I tell you something.

229
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:07,914
Italian men never, never
marry a girl who's not Italian.

230
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,513
<i>They play with you. Oh,
si, they like to do that.</i>

231
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,319
And then they
break your heart.

232
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,816
No. You find yourself
a good Dane, or even...

233
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,088
an Irishman.

234
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,072
<i>Oh, mannagg.</i>

235
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,744
What I'd trade for that.

236
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,616
I know, I know.

237
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,587
- What about her?
- She's all right.

238
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,560
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

239
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,029
- What do you mean, just all right?
- Come on.

240
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,464
You prejudiced against the most
beautiful women in the world?

241
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,491
No, but I'm in
love, you know that.

242
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,093
- "Oh, I'm in love. "
- Look.

243
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,435
This right here,
this is all yours.

244
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,032
Steve and I, we're
married. You owe us this.

245
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,201
Oh, I owe you this?

246
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,371
I owe it to you to pick up
girls at an Italian singles bar?

247
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,211
- Absolutely.
- Just not my thing.

248
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,459
- Hey, hey.
- What about her?

249
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,531
- Oh, she just gave you a look.
- She's cute, yeah.

250
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,129
That was a definite nibble.

251
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,300
Set the hook and reel her in.

252
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,676
She's hot, I'll give you that,
but I'm not interested in her.

253
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,985
Stop staring at me.
Aren't you gonna...

254
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,917
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're a sea lion. Roar.

255
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,952
- Sea lions bark, idiot.
- Whatever.

256
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,362
<i>That guldo stuff doesn't
work on hot chicks.</i>

257
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,387
Yeah?

258
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,026
- She's coming.
- She's coming over here.

259
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,697
- Think of something to say.
- Were you whistling at me?

260
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,174
No, I... It was... my...

261
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,006
- I'm Marisa.
- Jake. How are you?

262
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,205
- Nice to meet you.
- Our friend's nervous.

263
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,773
I think you just melted
the lining in his underwear.

264
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,345
I didn't... Nothing...
My underwear's fine.

265
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,480
Oh, nicely said.

266
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,285
- Do you wanna have a seat?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,518
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,219
- OK.
- Yeah.

269
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,161
- At the bar? Otherwise, they'll continue.
- OK.

270
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,061
No, no. Just go
get her a drink.

271
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,556
Just put it on the card.
It's a company expense.

272
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,832
I'll take care of her.

273
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,070
- What do you think?
- You guys are too much.

274
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,099
But... he is...

275
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,702
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,372
- I'll give you that.
- He's smart.

277
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,075
- Funny.
- Very bright.

278
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,481
- Great sense of humor.
- Intelligent.

279
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,110
- OK.
- Loves children.

280
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,984
- Really?
- Loves kids.

281
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,648
- Great with them.
- Yeah.

282
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,180
- I like that.
- We did well.

283
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,691
I think we did.

284
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,388
Oh, here he comes.
Here he comes.

285
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,057
Hey, the prodigal son returns.

286
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,566
Jerk one, jerk two.

287
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you, I'll take
that as a compliment.

288
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,932
- To beauty.
- To beauty!

289
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,236
- Beauty.
- And the beasts.

290
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,077
So, I'm probably glad I
missed everything so far.

291
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,574
Why would you say that, Jake? We
were just talking about true love.

292
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,884
Marisa here, believe it or not,
does not believe in soulmates.

293
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,255
- She thinks it's bullshit.
- I didn't say that.

294
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,021
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

295
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,960
Yes, you did!

296
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,488
Don't listen to them. They're busting
on me 'cause I believe in true love.

297
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,696
Well, me too. And I happen
to believe in soulmates.

298
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,932
Oh, come on, that
is such a crock.

299
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,032
It is, 'cause at any given time,
any two people can get together.

300
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,940
They just have to know
that each other exists.

301
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:56,607
Life is never-ending chaos,
with people struggling to exist.

302
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,113
- Now, that's deep.
- Thank you.

303
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,085
- He knows psychology.
- I do.

304
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,645
Look, let me just put it
in simpler terms for you.

305
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,657
Simple being the
operative word.

306
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,522
Now, take you, for example.

307
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,493
- You're a hot piece of ass.
- Jeez.

308
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,362
So why aren't you selling underwear
in a Victoria's Secret catalogue?

309
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,264
- There's a point somewhere.
- I hope so.

310
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,064
- OK.
- It's because nobody knows you exist.

311
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,038
But the right pictures in
the right people's hands...

312
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,565
next thing, you've got 13-year-olds
jacking off all over the world.

313
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,544
Why?

314
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,376
Because now they
know you exist.

315
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,812
- I really apologize.
- Wow.

316
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,580
I thought there was a
point there somewhere.

317
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,815
No, I get it. I
mean, it makes sense.

318
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,722
It makes sense? Really?

319
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,089
- No, it doesn't.
- OK.

320
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,822
You know what? Let me
ask you a question. Why...

321
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,422
Why does a nice, attractive
girl like you come here...

322
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,797
to get hit on by
the likes of them?

323
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,233
I don't know.

324
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,829
Maybe I'm just trying to
figure out what men exist.

325
00:17:54,606 --> 00:18:00,203
Well. Maybe she just came to find
a nice Italian man like Jake here.

326
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,948
They're not really my friends.

327
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,884
Ouch!

328
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,286
Ooh, I'm wounded. I am.

329
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,731
- So?
- So what?

330
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,065
- What happened?
- Let us live through you vicariously.

331
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,970
- She was sweet.
- Sweet? Chocolate's sweet!

332
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,974
This girl could knock the brass
off a doorknob with her smile!

333
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,568
Absolutely. What happened?

334
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,340
We had a nice
evening, you know?

335
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,212
We spent some time together,
we talked a bit, small talk.

336
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,843
- And then... we went home.
- You went home?

337
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,445
- You nailed her at her place?
- Nothing like that.

338
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,082
Come on. You didn't...

339
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,615
You did. You did, you
did, you did, didn't you?

340
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,423
No, I didn't, I didn't, I
didn't. I didn't do anything.

341
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,226
What do you want me to say?
We had a nice time. She's nice.

342
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,790
But I'm still in
love with Isabella.

343
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,133
OK. Listen.

344
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,802
Just, please, please tell me
that you got her phone number...

345
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,812
- so we can smack some sense into you.
- Yeah.

346
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,181
- I'm gonna cry, Pops.
- Unbelievable.

347
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,083
A man should cry.

348
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,850
I can't believe this. How
could you screw that up?

349
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,484
- Yes.
- You were so stupid!

350
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,790
Hi, guys.

351
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,990
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

352
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,828
So, this is it, huh?

353
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,872
This is... this is it.
This is... fish heaven.

354
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,469
Anything you desire from the
eastern seaboard, we got it here.

355
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,036
- Aldo Tempesti.
- Hi. Marisa.

356
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,211
So...

357
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,747
You forgot to
ask for my number.

358
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,020
So I thought I'd...

359
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,255
- Loser!
- The freakin' number!

360
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,528
- Just in case.
- Yeah, no, yeah. This is...

361
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,763
This is great. You... That's
pretty... pretty handwriting.

362
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,296
Thank you.

363
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,332
OK.

364
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,676
You know what? Let's just
close the deal right here.

365
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,944
I make his hours, so...

366
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,213
Oh, he's available tonight.

367
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,278
He's got tomorrow night
off. The whole week off.

368
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,553
- You can call me when you want.
- No. He didn't take your number.

369
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,389
It's out of his
hands. Tomorrow?

370
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,725
No, tomorrow night's
not really good for me.

371
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:35,028
- Stay out of this, would you?
- Actually, next week is better for me.

372
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,127
Next week. Tuesday's
looking real good for me.

373
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,730
I was... I was thinking,
maybe more Monday.

374
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,706
At around... I
don't know, seven...

375
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,038
- 7:30?
- 7:30.

376
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,236
- Monday.
- Monday.

377
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,302
Perfect. OK.

378
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,644
Monday it is.

379
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,239
- OK.
- All right.

380
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,274
- I'll see you then.
- See you then.

381
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,081
OK. Bye.

382
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,315
- Let me get that door for you.
- Thank you.

383
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,119
Yes!

384
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,385
Thank you.

385
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,857
Thanks for coming in.

386
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,667
- Don't screw this up.
- I'm not gonna screw anything up.

387
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:13,831
Come on. Hey! You're all thinking
with your little men, huh?

388
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,102
This is a big, big mistake.

389
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,202
This is an Italian woman, and
Italian women have brothers.

390
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,110
Oh, it's all fun and games...

391
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,911
until somebody
loses a testicle!

392
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,384
That's not funny.

393
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,887
Tell you about my
cousin Luigi, eh?

394
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,389
- Yeah, cousin Eunuch.
- Ah! Cousin Eunuch, see?

395
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,018
<i>- He make joke, now.
- Senza Cazzo, we call him.</i>

396
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,051
Get to work. Asshole.

397
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,734
- I want candy.
- No candy.

398
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,335
- Candy apples.
- Aww, I want candy!

399
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,844
Yeah, and what else?

400
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,074
- Isabella!
- Oh, God.

401
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,776
Oh, my God, this is so weird.
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,717
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

403
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,982
- Stay away, Jake. I mean it.
- What? Come on.

404
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,990
It's the commons. I'm
just passing through.

405
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,151
Hey, you and me are soulmates.

406
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,593
I have kids, Jake,
and lots of 'em.

407
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,427
I love kids. Plus, the big
one's probably mine anyway.

408
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,663
Hey. Hey! What? Did you ever
have them genetically tested?

409
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,694
Unreal! You know,
you're unreal.

410
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,706
He was born 12 months
after we last did it.

411
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,469
So you say. I know. Whatever.

412
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,772
Come on. What's it gonna take?

413
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,338
Jake, please. Please let
me spare you your dignity.

414
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,941
But... I'm not gonna
take no for an answer.

415
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,076
- Excuse me, sweetie.
- I'm not!

416
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,114
What...

417
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,090
What is wrong with your kids?

418
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,593
They don't like you, Jake.
Come on, boys. Get in.

419
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,060
- But...
- Good job.

420
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,656
I have a date on Monday night.

421
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,724
- Good for you.
- Wait...

422
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,863
Can I get a ride?

423
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,232
- Got a bar?
- Morning, John.

424
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,294
- Hey, Jake, how are you?
- All right.

425
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,171
- What's going on?
- I need about 50 pounds of haddock...

426
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,073
- Look out... 20
pounds of mussels. Nice.

427
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,169
- All right, relax!
- Nice. See him do it?

428
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,010
- Beautiful.
- Nice skate.

429
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,017
Yeah. Think I dated a girl
looked like this, once.

430
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,150
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Your receipt.

431
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,383
- Have a good one.
- Take it easy.

432
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,236
I know what my boy Gianluca
tell you, but listen.

433
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,301
Women are sacred.

434
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:10,508
They need to be treated like
ladies, not passing cargo vessels.

435
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,915
- I know that, I got a good woman.
- A good woman?

436
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,351
A good woman is love.

437
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:20,347
Pure, true and breakable,
like Venetian glass.

438
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,485
Remember.

439
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,019
Every daughter has a father.

440
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:30,057
And most have brothers
with sharp knives.

441
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,436
Hey. Somebody's getting
some tonight, huh?

442
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,599
Sure, man. Party's on tonight.

443
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,602
Take your camera tonight.

444
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,474
Do me some pictures.
With nipple.

445
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,147
- Jake, look at me.
- What?

446
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,207
- Promise you won't screw up.
- I'm not gonna...

447
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,718
- Promise?
- I promise!

448
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,550
I'm not gonna screw it up,
man. Do you want it in blood?

449
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,081
All right, look. Let's go over your
plan. You do have a plan, right?

450
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,822
I'm not gonna lay it out for you.
I'II... take her to dinner or something.

451
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,299
- Come on, dinner's obvious. Where?
- I don't know. La Trattoria.

452
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,564
What are you, retarded? You
can't take her to the North End.

453
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,401
- It's too Italian.
- That's the point, she's Italian.

454
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,873
No, no, take her
to my cousin Ennio.

455
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,569
He'll fix you up nice.

456
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,171
No, you can't take an Italian woman
to the North End for the first date.

457
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:19,240
That's like a priest taking a little
boy to an opera, it's too obvious.

458
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,913
Yeah. Forget Italian. You gotta
stay away from your ethnic roots.

459
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,717
I'm not taking
her for a kielbasa.

460
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,486
You're not a dumb Polack
anymore. You're Italian now.

461
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,289
I'm not gonna
pretend I'm Italian.

462
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,625
You better pretend,
and pretend good.

463
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,962
Look, an Italian can spot an
impostor a mile away. If they did...

464
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,367
- Could get your nuts chopped off.
- Come on. It's the 21st century.

465
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,564
Nobody'll get hurt.
It's a stereotype.

466
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,971
He's right. The
stereotype is bad.

467
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,672
Italian men are lovers.

468
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,372
Unless you mess with
their women, and then...

469
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,045
It's OK to take her to an Italian restaurant,
just not in the North End, all right?

470
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,110
And, you know, order for her.

471
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,385
Because the Italian women,
they love to be taken care of.

472
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,951
Freud says that a woman knows within
five minutes of sitting down to dinner...

473
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,189
if she's gonna
sleep with a guy.

474
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,427
Brings up, what do you
got in mind for dessert?

475
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,028
Tiramisu?

476
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,006
Well, one dessert, two forks.

477
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,872
- Don't screw up.
- I'm not gonna.

478
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,968
I'm telling you, if
you screw this up...

479
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,138
I'm not! I'm not
gonna screw it up!

480
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,685
- Hi.
- Hey.

481
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,417
Wow.

482
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,084
- Should I go change?
- No.

483
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,252
No, you... you look fine.

484
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,195
I'm probably the one
who should go change.

485
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,266
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah. You too.

486
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,565
So, it's freezing.
Where's your car?

487
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,005
Actually, my truck smells like
fish, so we'll take the subway.

488
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,634
- Subway?
- Yeah, it's always more convenient.

489
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,339
You don't have to pay for
parking or anything. You know.

490
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,507
You look really beautiful.

491
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,073
Thank you.

492
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,012
First date.

493
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,087
I feel like I'm
back in high school.

494
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,953
Yeah, me too.

495
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,335
Why... What's so funny?

496
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,600
Nothing, I'm sorry.

497
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,937
Are you laughing at me?

498
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,306
- You are.
- I'm not, I promise.

499
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,470
- Washington Square.
- I promise.

500
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,275
- Yeah?
- Sorry.

501
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,972
Look...

502
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,181
I'm gonna tell you something.

503
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,812
OK.

504
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,790
Tell me.

505
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,554
It's kind of
embarrassing, a little bit.

506
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,594
Just tell me. I'm sure
I've heard it before.

507
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,202
This is nice.

508
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,764
And I don't wanna... I
don't wanna start anything

509
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,641
without being totally
honest with you.

510
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,349
I'm involved with
another woman.

511
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,753
Yeah, we... we've been together
for 12 years. On and off. Well...

512
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,387
Mostly off, lately, but...

513
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,987
I just... I thought
you should know.

514
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,055
OK.

515
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,028
Honesty's the best
policy, you know.

516
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,603
Yeah, I agree with you.

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,937
Wow.

518
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,909
But if you want to tell me
anything, you know, you can...

519
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,969
Now's a good time.

520
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,174
I don't have
anything like that.

521
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,975
Where are we?

522
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,021
I'm sorry. You're upset, huh?

523
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,890
I'm fine. Surprised, maybe.

524
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,794
I just didn't wanna have
a nice evening together...

525
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,266
- and then have it get all awkward.
- Well, it's awkward.

526
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,165
- Have you been here before?
- No.

527
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,238
Don't worry. I know
what you're getting.

528
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,312
<i>Buonasera. Can I start you
off with something to drink?</i>

529
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:13,750
<i>Maybe un belllsslmo, very
nice Barolo or Chianti.</i>

530
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,912
I think we're ready to order.

531
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,082
The lady's gonna have
the calamari appetizer...

532
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,888
and the spinach and
mushroom penne pasta.

533
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,521
And can she get that with extra
oregano and a side of garlic?

534
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,861
- Garlic?
- It's good. It's really good.

535
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,669
As you wish, madam.

536
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,432
And for you, sir?

537
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,871
I have no idea. What's good?

538
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,876
<i>Spaghettl all'amatrlclana.</i>

539
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,572
The house favorite.

540
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,844
- That sounds perfect.
- You know what?

541
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,612
I think I'll have that too.

542
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,085
- Really?
- Yeah.

543
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,883
And to drink?

544
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,287
House Chianti.

545
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,655
Actually, I'm thinking
of something...

546
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,354
in a significantly
higher price range.

547
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,727
Maybe one of your Barolos.

548
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,429
- Wonderful choice, madam.
- Thank you.

549
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,169
That was interesting.

550
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,072
You saved enough
money, not parking.

551
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,244
Is this about my girlfriend?

552
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,948
'Cause she's cool with
this. She knows I'm here.

553
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,888
- She knows you're here?
- Yeah.

554
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,985
Just let it go. I've almost
completely forgotten about her.

555
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,761
Psychiatrists say you can tell
within the first five minutes...

556
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,893
of having dinner with someone
whether you're gonna have...

557
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,204
Whether... whether it's
gonna work out or not.

558
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,970
You can tell.

559
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,506
Do you have a lot of
experience with psychiatrists?

560
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,515
No. No! It's just, I hear
about 'em all day long...

561
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,109
'cause Steve, he's
studying to get his degree.

562
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,983
- Psychology.
- Yeah.

563
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,510
He's a college man.

564
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,580
So what do you do?

565
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,751
- I'm a doctor.
- Really?

566
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,685
- You're shitting me.
- No!

567
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,391
Huh. That's so
cool. What kind?

568
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,423
A veterinarian.

569
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,934
OK, so you're
not a real doctor.

570
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,743
No, I just mean, you know,
you work with animals.

571
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,109
It's not exactly humans,
that's all I'm saying.

572
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,738
It's cool. I
like it. I get it.

573
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,443
It's just, when I think
doctor, I think, you know...

574
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,317
heart attack on a plane,
"Is there a doctor on board?"

575
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,448
That kind of thing,
you know, it's so cool.

576
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,958
So you... And
you love animals.

577
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,987
Yeah, well, you know, I'm suspicious
of anyone who doesn't love animals.

578
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,828
Or children.

579
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,994
Well, there you go. That's...
We got that in common.

580
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,266
Really? You love animals?

581
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,897
Do I... do I love animals?

582
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,101
Yeah, of... I work
in a fish market.

583
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,169
I love kids too, I
think kids are great.

584
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,679
I got three of 'em.

585
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,113
Well, they're not
mine, technically.

586
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,947
- They're my girlfriend's.
- That's great.

587
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,086
- Here, I'll help you up.
- No. You know what? It's all right.

588
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,565
Let's not spend a nice evening
and then have it get all awkward.

589
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,430
You're not coming up.

590
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,300
No, of course, I
know, I know... that.

591
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,363
But I had a wonderful
time tonight, didn't you?

592
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,683
You told her what?

593
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,776
I knew you were gonna
screw it up. I knew it!

594
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,414
I didn't want her to find out I was
involved with someone and get disappointed.

595
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,856
Are you the biggest moron
of all time or just acting?

596
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,587
The date wasn't
going so hot, anyway.

597
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,461
She was sending mixed signals.
She was acting all disinterested.

598
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,591
That's exactly what I mean.
Mixed signals are clear signals.

599
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,068
And why the hell tell
her you have a girlfriend?

600
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:56,369
Which you don't. I mean,
this chick is the real deal.

601
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,671
I mean, she's wicked hot...

602
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,701
and she's a doctor!

603
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,806
She's... she's not really a
doctor. She's a veterinarian.

604
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,750
- Veterinarians go to medical school.
- In an animal hospital.

605
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,185
Not a hospital hospital.
She's not a real doctor.

606
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:14,214
So you would say I'm not a doctor
if I get my PhD in psychology?

607
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,862
Look, that's
sort of different.

608
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,128
You would be
dealing with humans.

609
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,658
She's dealing with animals.

610
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,933
Ain't a doctor.

611
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:31,237
Technically, I don't think
a psychologist is, either.

612
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,608
Technically, anyone
with a PhD is a doctor.

613
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,842
A doctor of philosophy. A
doctor of English literature.

614
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,611
- A doctor of fine arts.
- Hold up.

615
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,517
I'm with Jake. They're not
doctors. Those are bullshit doctors.

616
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,113
They shouldn't even be able
to put "Doctor" in their name.

617
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,147
Come on!

618
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,159
Chiropractors, huh?

619
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,252
Acupuncturists. Podiatrists.

620
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,785
They're not doctors!

621
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,822
So... I save lives...

622
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,028
by talking people out of...

623
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:04,073
By talking people out of throwing
themselves in the tracks at North Station...

624
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,339
or hurling their bodies off
an overpass onto the MassPike.

625
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,972
All day long, I'm
talking to them...

626
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,005
and I'm not a doctor to you?

627
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,651
No. But you could be.

628
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,679
If you go to medical school
and become a psychiatrist.

629
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,559
Psychologists, man, are just another
group trying to cheat the system.

630
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,195
You told him!

631
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,426
I'm sorry.

632
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,402
I'm sure Harvard Medical School
has evening classes you could take.

633
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,564
I don't need to be a doctor.

634
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,443
- Just figure I'm saving people's lives.
- Oh, no, you're saving people's lives.

635
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,775
That's what I'm trained to
do. I save people's lives.

636
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,213
- I'm a lifesaver. - You're
like a comic-book hero.

637
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,307
Can you save me a
bite of your sandwich?

638
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,634
Hello, Mrs. Cordova.

639
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,109
- Isabella!
- Hi, Mrs. Cordova.

640
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,143
- Hey.
- Go away.

641
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,052
Let's just go get
a coffee, please.

642
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,250
I just wanna talk.

643
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,350
I know the kids are gone.

644
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,796
- I'm not letting you in. Talk.
- Really?

645
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,355
You can't still be mad. I...

646
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,230
All right, five minutes.

647
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,565
Five minutes.

648
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,568
You look really pretty.

649
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,115
Don't you still
think about me at all?

650
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,617
Of course. You
call me every day.

651
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,084
Well, that's fair enough.

652
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,110
But, I mean, if I didn't...

653
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,046
would you still?

654
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,187
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- So you would?

655
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,288
- You would!
- Jake! Children.

656
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,562
- The eldest one's mine anyway.
- You are crazy.

657
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,339
Come back to me.

658
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,216
OK. Your ten minutes are up.

659
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,951
You gotta get outta here.

660
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,251
Yeah, I was about to
go anyway. I mean...

661
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,315
You don't have to kick
me out or anything.

662
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,724
I was... I was about
to leave anyway.

663
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,355
I wasn't gonna have
another coffee, you know.

664
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,255
Same time tomorrow?

665
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,408
<i>- Hey, Papa. How are you?
- All right.</i>

666
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,639
- There a holiday I don't know about?
- Banker's hours.

667
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,113
- Get your ass out here, we're busy.
- I'm here, I'm here.

668
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,207
- I saw her today!
- Treat your fleas?

669
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,013
Not her. Her.

670
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,418
- Oh. Isabella.
- Yeah.

671
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,321
- She made me a cappuccino.
- In her house?

672
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,690
All right. That's it. Jake,
I've had it with your shit.

673
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,593
Me and Steve, we bust
our asses around here.

674
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,928
You come and go as you
please, all hours of the day.

675
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,059
Jake, it's not fair.

676
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,332
I got no other option
here. I gotta fire you.

677
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,397
Fire me. You can't fire me.

678
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,408
- Well, I think I just did.
- I own this place.

679
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,776
Technically, yes.

680
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,714
But I promised your parents before
they died I would not let you...

681
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,217
- run it into the ground.
- Revenue's up 250% last quarter.

682
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,482
150% last year. I
think we're doing OK.

683
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,013
Stop chasing Isabella.

684
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,184
- Is that what this is about?
- Yes!

685
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,386
You know, call Marisa.

686
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,090
The one you told
you had a girlfriend?

687
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,326
- She hates me.
- Isabella hates you.

688
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,959
She still makes
you cappuccino.

689
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,027
Italian women, they need
to nurture their men.

690
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,630
- Tell her the truth...
- No, don't tell her the truth.

691
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,607
Tell her the truth and
she will come around.

692
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,974
I can't tell her anything.

693
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,672
She won't even
accept my calls.

694
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,612
Do you blame her?

695
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,842
Hi.

696
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,854
- Who needs this, Eric?
- All right, buddy?

697
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,990
Oh, look at the happy couple.

698
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,086
Jakie B, what are you
doing with that fish?

699
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,097
Kiss your wife.

700
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,271
My fish.

701
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,608
He just...

702
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,136
He doesn't quite seem
up to it these days.

703
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,706
I was wondering if the
veterinarian could come out...

704
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,739
take a look at him.

705
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,720
I'm sorry, sir, but we
don't take care of fish.

706
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,984
Why? They're animals too.

707
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,382
They're animals, but
they're aquatic animals.

708
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,590
Marine animal doctors
take care of fish.

709
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,427
That's not our
doctor's specialty.

710
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,729
OK.

711
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,758
How much?

712
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,437
Huh? 20?

713
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,472
OK, you don't
like Mr. Jackson.

714
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,304
How about Benjamin?

715
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,578
Huh? Is the doctor around?

716
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,107
- Are you Michael?
- How's that?

717
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,916
Ah, this isn't about the fish.

718
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,083
Are you and the
doctor involved?

719
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,354
Is it that obvious?

720
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,764
Let me see what I can do.

721
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,264
Hey.

722
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,371
I like your dog.

723
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,478
Nice.

724
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,114
All of these are
good. Hey, smile.

725
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,909
Mommy, is that
man a pedophile?

726
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,686
Hey. Paparazzi.

727
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,658
Are you serious?

728
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,252
- You... you're not the...
- Bring your fish.

729
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,287
- On second thoughts...
- Now! I'm busy.

730
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,527
You're wasting my
time with your fishy.

731
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,570
What, are you too
good for a goldfish?

732
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,443
You look like a mobile
Chinese restaurant.

733
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,311
You got an anchovy pizza
you need some help with?

734
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,749
Hey, real cute.

735
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,578
Put your fish on
the examining table.

736
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,288
- You sit. Sit.
- Hey, look, I don't think we...

737
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,422
have to do this, I mean...

738
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,456
- Really...
- Sit!

739
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,196
How long's your fish
been acting weird?

740
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,966
I don't know. A couple
of days, I guess.

741
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,907
- Why didn't you bring him in sooner?
- I thought he'd pull through.

742
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,137
This is a pet fish, isn't
it? He could have died.

743
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,577
Look, I don't
want to be rude...

744
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,571
but do you think maybe I could
see the other veterinarian?

745
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,607
I think that might
be very helpful.

746
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,854
This is Sammy. He's got
respiratory distress.

747
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,329
The owner says he's been
lethargic and not acting himself.

748
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,422
OK, I got it. Thank you.

749
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,727
What are you doing?

750
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,400
Sammy's been acting
a little weird. I...

751
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,876
I think he might have
pinkeye or something.

752
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,105
This isn't a pet.

753
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,115
Sammy, don't listen to
anything this evil woman says.

754
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,380
OK. I see through
this. What do you want?

755
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,656
We had fun the other night.

756
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,489
Fine. I had a good
time the other night.

757
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,361
All right, I get the fact that you
want nothing to do with me, but...

758
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,888
Well, I really
enjoyed your company.

759
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,026
No, no, no, no. No. No.

760
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,594
What? Just because I'm
not sexually available...

761
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,105
we can't be friends?

762
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,970
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends.

763
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,774
Like, spend time with each other
because we like each other's company.

764
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,578
- And just be friends.
- Exactly.

765
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,346
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

766
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,644
Because...

767
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,121
- I'm 33 years old.
- No way.

768
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,321
My biological
clock is ticking.

769
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,991
I don't have time for friends.

770
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,830
So having friends somehow affects
your ability to have children?

771
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,167
- Yes.
- How? You gotta explain this to me.

772
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,968
When a man and a
woman are friends...

773
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,498
one of them always ends
up wanting the other one.

774
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,238
If neither is interested...

775
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,111
then there's no incentive for
the friendship in the first place.

776
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,513
What are you
doing Friday night?

777
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,479
- None of your business.
- So no plans?

778
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,750
- I have plans.
- No, you don't.

779
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,984
- You don't. What?
- Plans.

780
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,550
Yeah, now that's mature
for a 33-year-old.

781
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,994
You'd rather stay home
alone than make a friend.

782
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,863
Because you're sexually
attracted to me...

783
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,026
and I'm emotionally
unavailable.

784
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,366
- I have a date.
- Oh, yeah? Who is he?

785
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,872
- His name's Michael.
- There's no Michael.

786
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,397
No, really. I'm sort
of seeing him now.

787
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,705
Fine. I get the message.

788
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,119
Actually, you know what?

789
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,386
Leave Sammy here.

790
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,052
Yeah?

791
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,085
I'll give him back to you...

792
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,296
- Saturday?
- Saturday?

793
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,733
Are you asking
me out on a date?

794
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,070
Friends don't
date. They hang out.

795
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,145
But you told me to go out
with her in the first place.

796
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,381
Well, that was before
you told me she was 33.

797
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,889
- Don't go.
- She's 33.

798
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,449
Imagine your balls
in a vice grip.

799
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,587
That's what her ovaries are doing,
except they're screaming for sperm.

800
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,963
- Your sperm.
- It's not even gonna be a date.

801
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,093
It's gonna be... We're
gonna be hanging out.

802
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,194
- Like hanging out in high school?
- Yeah.

803
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,501
Like a guy and a girl
hanging out. People do that.

804
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,063
- No, they don't.
- Why not?

805
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,202
Because sooner or later, one of
them's gonna wanna swap some fluids.

806
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:11,305
Play some tonsil hockey.
She's 33! Walk away.

807
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,816
Well, hold on. It's not
like he's gonna marry her.

808
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,445
Exactly. I'm not
gonna marry the girl.

809
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,455
Just bang her a few
times. Then move on.

810
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,888
<i>Lesson numero uno.
La salsa dl pomodoro.</i>

811
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,730
<i>No Italian man can resist
la salsa dl pomodoro.</i>

812
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,794
Well, I wouldn't say he's a
man. He's more of a little boy.

813
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,566
A very good-looking
little boy...

814
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,574
But this is
friendship. Not love.

815
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,339
Hey. He and his girlfriend,
together, what, 12 years?

816
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,608
Not married, they not serious.

817
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,945
He's what you call fair game.

818
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,510
And the quickest way to a man's
heart is through the stomach.

819
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,714
- What if I don't wanna get to his...
- Oh, wait.

820
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,189
You want love Italian-style?

821
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,159
There is no
mercy, it is a war.

822
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,287
And the women
are the generals.

823
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,820
Go, go. Put that in the pan.

824
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,596
And the food! Food,
their greatest weapon, eh?

825
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,506
Stir! Stir it, or
it'll burn. Stir.

826
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,585
- Hey.
- Hi.

827
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,450
You're not dressed.

828
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,786
You still look
good, I mean, I...

829
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,520
I would still... Aren't
we... aren't we going out?

830
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,755
No, we're friends.
I made us dinner.

831
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,820
- Really?
- Come in.

832
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,991
- OK. These are for you.
- Thank you.

833
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,558
- How you doing?
- Hi. Oh, hi.

834
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:39,967
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

835
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,971
- Oh, wow, vinegar.
- Yeah, it's Italian.

836
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,168
- Interesting.
- This is not what I expected.

837
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,178
- How's that?
- You got the fluffy couch...

838
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,874
and the carpeted
floors, it's...

839
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,677
It's kind of American.

840
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,844
I expected more of that Italian
hot-blooded style, you know?

841
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,820
Clean lines everywhere.

842
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,551
This place looks more like
my grandmother's house.

843
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,560
Wow. You know exactly
what to say to the ladies.

844
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,621
- Shall we eat? Before it gets cold?
- Sure. Yeah.

845
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,366
- You need help with anything?
- No.

846
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,976
Sammy? You cooked my fish?

847
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,879
- He's cured. No more pinkeye.
- You cooked my pet?

848
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:28,715
- He wasn't your pet, Jake. -
We were on a first-name basis.

849
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,447
What if I'd
brought you a puppy?

850
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:37,193
I don't play games. I dumped
my first fianc because he lied.

851
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,457
Yeah? What about
the second one?

852
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,261
He lied too, but
his was much bigger.

853
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,096
What did the first
one lie about?

854
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,297
He claimed he went to
undergrad at Harvard.

855
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,930
- And?
- He went to BU.

856
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,101
- Oh, no! Come on.
- He couldn't handle living in Boston...

857
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,202
and not being able to
call himself a Harvard man.

858
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,837
So you honestly...
You dumped the guy...

859
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,940
you were considering spending the
rest of your life with 'cause of that?

860
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,883
- Yeah.
- That's kind of harsh.

861
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,786
He was my fianc. He
shouldn't be lying to me.

862
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,581
So, which one is he?

863
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,617
Oh, he's not up there. I
don't keep pictures of my exes.

864
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,259
There's not one
picture of your ex here?

865
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,392
No! Why keep pictures of people
that are no longer in your life?

866
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,403
I keep pictures of everybody,
just in case I never see 'em again.

867
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,928
But why would you care?

868
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,100
I don't know. For me,
once a relationship ends...

869
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,440
I don't ever look back.

870
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,973
So, what part of Italy
is your family from?

871
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,048
They're from the
north. From Palermo.

872
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,778
Palermo? Isn't...

873
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,451
Isn't Palermo in the
south, down by Sicily?

874
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,858
The northernmost part
of the... of the south.

875
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,556
They...

876
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,498
They're very high... They
live in the mountains.

877
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,899
So, it's like... It's such
a small country, anyway.

878
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,335
Where do your parents...
Where are they from?

879
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,339
- I... I can't say.
- Why not?

880
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,034
- Were they in the Mafia?
- Are yours?

881
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,009
Yeah. Come on,
where are they from?

882
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,170
- Is it that important?
- Yeah, it's important.

883
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,306
- To an Italian, it's very important.
- They're from the north.

884
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,078
<i>Torlno.</i>

885
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:11,379
- I can't believe I just told you that.
- Oh, yeah. Big deal.

886
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,015
Your secret's out. Maybe you'll
have to kill me, now, right?

887
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,184
- I might have to.
- Yeah.

888
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,750
All right, so...

889
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,162
I mean, so you spend weeks...

890
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,928
or even months of your life
committed to someone, and then, what?

891
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,128
Like... They just...

892
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,160
They're erased, like
they never existed?

893
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,968
You're a past-dweller.

894
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,475
Fine, if holding on to memories
makes me a past-dweller...

895
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,069
- then I'm a past-dweller.
- There's only three choices.

896
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,580
Past, present and future.

897
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,673
So where does that leave us?

898
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,715
You have a girlfriend.

899
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,826
I need to know your level of
commitment to this relationship.

900
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,424
None! There is
no relationship.

901
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,196
I'm being serious, now.

902
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,999
Seriously, I need to know.

903
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,404
You do know. There is none.

904
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,401
I think I might
have found someone.

905
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,470
That's great. I'm
happy for you, Jake.

906
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,505
She knows about us.

907
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,882
And I told her, don't
worry, I told her.

908
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,149
But... It's just...

909
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,553
I don't know, she's...
she's different.

910
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,188
She doesn't have big boobs
and look like a supermodel?

911
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,959
No, no, she's got
those qualities.

912
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,557
But it's just...

913
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,467
There's something about
her, I don't know, she's...

914
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,598
She's kind of cool.

915
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,041
Run through the
wild with her, Jake.

916
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,910
Make love to her
in exotic places.

917
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,937
You're free.

918
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,642
There is no us.

919
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,555
You keep saying that, but
I just want you to know...

920
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,963
that once I'm
gone, it's forever.

921
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,165
Your pictures come off
the wall, hers go up.

922
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,434
I'm not a
past-dweller, you know.

923
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,047
My timing's off, I'm gonna run
ahead and do some sprint work.

924
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,990
- I'll meet you at the bridge.
- No, I'm coming.

925
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,586
- No, Jake, I can't run this slowly.
- I'm coming.

926
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,619
- I'm coming.
- Forget it.

927
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,357
Good run, huh?

928
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
Feels good?

929
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,169
What are you doing,
running off like that?

930
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,005
You're a woman,
you're gonna...

931
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,840
gonna get raped or
killed or something.

932
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:25,405
No, I could outrun them. You're the
one that's going to be somebody's bitch.

933
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,542
I'm just saying that
it's dangerous, all right?

934
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,609
Competitive, aren't we?

935
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,547
Whatever, Flo-Jo.

936
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,389
- Wow, you look good.
- Thank you.

937
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,488
The fish looks great.

938
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,029
Here.

939
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,127
- You got him?
- Yeah.

940
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,139
- He's cute, right?
- Is this what you want?

941
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,004
What, this?

942
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:57,404
- This as in a lobster?
- No, this as in your dreams.

943
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,610
I don't even know if I could
answer that if I wanted to.

944
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,048
I just kind of take every
day as it comes, you know?

945
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,850
I'm a present-dweller.

946
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,357
- Well, the days are coming fast.
- Yeah?

947
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,723
- Soon there won't be any more.
- Honestly?

948
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,791
I never thought that
much about my dreams.

949
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,197
I guess my dreams
just kind of found me.

950
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,269
All right.

951
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,465
Well, the
Napoleonic complex...

952
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:28,467
it comes from Napoleon
denying that he was Italian.

953
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,503
He was pretending
to be French.

954
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,744
He forgot, you know, that he
was a lover and not a fighter.

955
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,810
That is why, to this day, my
cousin Pepino in the bakery...

956
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,618
will not sell napoleons.

957
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,727
What... what does that
have to do with women?

958
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,424
Ah, everything has
to do with women.

959
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,994
An Italian woman...

960
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:56,165
they will cook for you, clean,
iron, take care of the kids...

961
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,369
but it is the man's job...

962
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,537
to make her want to do
those things for him.

963
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,946
- I think I can handle that.
- Sure, sure.

964
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,350
You make her feel special...

965
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,947
you make her
feel like a woman.

966
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,752
Like the song, you know.

967
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,692
It is the man's job to work...

968
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,627
<i>to protect la famlglla...</i>

969
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,496
to make decisions,
to pay the bills...

970
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,195
<i>the mortgage,
everything, tutto.</i>

971
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,763
But it is the woman's job...

972
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,765
to make the man want to do
all these things for her.

973
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,507
<i>- Caplscl?
- Yeah, but I can cover my share of bills.</i>

974
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,415
No, no, no, no, no.
You're Italian now.

975
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:44,943
Remember, it is
the little things...

976
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:48,651
between the man and the
woman that count, eh?

977
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,132
- Gimme something about him.
- No.

978
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,367
- Tell me something.
- You don't want to hear it.

979
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,773
Yes, I do. If we're
going to be friends...

980
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,109
then I get to hear about him and
I get to spew forth my advice.

981
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:13,343
- My simple but profound advice.
- No, it just feels wrong...

982
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:17,547
talking about, you know,
such intimate things with you.

983
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,214
Pretend I'm a homo.

984
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,089
A gay man, OK?
I'm just saying...

985
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:26,357
that way it'll just roll
off of me, I won't care.

986
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,591
- Come on.
- I... OK. OK.

987
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,725
- You asked for it.
- I asked for it.

988
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,301
- I don't mean to complain...
- But...

989
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,239
But he's kind of boring.

990
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,265
- Boring how?
- Yeah, I mean...

991
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,607
- if I'm dating a guy...
- Right.

992
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:45,376
...he's gotta be a step up from my
vibrator, because that's a sure thing.

993
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:49,215
You know, I mean, it's not like I
need a new, crazy idea every time...

994
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,914
but come on, mix
it up a little!

995
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,014
Throw on an occasional video.

996
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,547
Throw it on.

997
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,685
I know.

998
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,759
I gave him some
of my best DVDs.

999
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,393
I don't think he's watched
a single one of them.

1000
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,402
For example...

1001
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,428
the other night,

1002
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,066
we were doing
it doggy-style...

1003
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,008
on the washing machine.

1004
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,877
And I slapped him, and...

1005
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,881
She did what?

1006
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,949
All right, you might
wanna rethink this.

1007
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,114
Just ask yourself, what
would a fisherman do?

1008
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,486
She's out of my comfort zone.

1009
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,788
- I would say.
- Yeah.

1010
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,556
Yeah, that is...

1011
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,587
Here she is.

1012
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,368
I had a break. Thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

1013
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,795
- Hi.
- Hi.

1014
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,967
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dr. Costa.

1015
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,000
- How you doing?
- So...

1016
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,341
Wow. You know
what? If you guys...

1017
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,646
If you cleaned up
some of these boxes...

1018
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,276
Gianluca, Gianluca.

1019
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,649
- I got a system there.
- Well, clearly not one that's working.

1020
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,789
Jake. Do something
about this, will you?

1021
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,764
You need a woman's touch.

1022
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,100
Don't you have any
animals to heal?

1023
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,626
- Some sick puppies...
- Come on. You guys can help.

1024
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,765
No, no, no, it's... it's
not in our contract...

1025
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,674
We... we only do a
half-hour clean-up a day...

1026
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,473
it's... it's union rules.

1027
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,605
- It's union rules.
- Only, yeah.

1028
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,672
Jake, take care of this.
We're gonna get a beer.

1029
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,581
Yeah.

1030
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,950
They... He really does
have a system, it works...

1031
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,978
- Work...
pretty well.

1032
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,714
Nobody's gonna spend
this much for fish.

1033
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:14,230
People wanna pay more. It makes
them feel like the quality's better.

1034
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,529
- Spoken like a true woman.
- No, it's all about presentation.

1035
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,127
If your fish look clean,
the sales will soar.

1036
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,501
I promise.

1037
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,953
What happened?

1038
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,648
This is a disaster.

1039
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,714
What the hell is this?
We selling lemonade now?

1040
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,817
You've straightened
my pictures.

1041
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,385
It's clean. It's just a
little bit cleaner, that's all.

1042
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,421
What do you mean, it's clean?
It's like an operating room.

1043
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,331
You cleaned my floor.

1044
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,293
You could eat off this
floor. This is awful.

1045
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,737
- It's a disaster.
- It's wonderful.

1046
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,604
It was her idea.

1047
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,076
So you're coming
this weekend...

1048
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,305
- to the faculty dinner with me.
- You serious? No.

1049
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:06,076
- Yes.
- No, I do not wanna go to a faculty dinner.

1050
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,583
You have to. It's
friendship duties.

1051
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,586
- Intelligent people bore me.
- Oh, my God.

1052
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,645
Jake, don't start
with me. You're coming.

1053
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,884
- OK, Mom.
- Excuse me?

1054
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,484
- You sound like my mother.
- Well, you sound like a child.

1055
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,223
- You're a child.
- My God.

1056
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,094
Is your family
still in Palermo?

1057
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,190
Palermo?

1058
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,997
No.

1059
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,771
Actually, my... my
parents are dead.

1060
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,070
- Shut up, Jake.
- Seriously.

1061
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,511
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1062
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,275
- It's OK. I know you didn't know.
- Wow. I...

1063
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,612
They... they died
during my senior year.

1064
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,244
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

1065
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,653
You know, I loved my family
when they were around.

1066
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,556
It was great. My old man,
he was something else.

1067
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,719
He was such a character.

1068
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,854
- You want kids?
- I don't know.

1069
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,092
- I'd make a terrible father.
- No, you wouldn't.

1070
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,760
Trust me, kids aren't for me.

1071
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,429
I have a friend who's got three
children, and she's always...

1072
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,338
That's your girlfriend,
Jake. Not your friend.

1073
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,842
The point is, kids messed
up her whole life...

1074
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,573
and now she's stuck in a marriage
that she doesn't want to be in.

1075
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,810
Wait. Your
girlfriend's married?

1076
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,943
Yeah.

1077
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,920
Well, I knew her before
she was married, though.

1078
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,685
She's been in love
with me all along.

1079
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,715
Are you in love with her?

1080
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,323
Thank you, Mrs. Vianelli.

1081
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,355
You. You're slacking off.

1082
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,459
I'd fire you if I could.

1083
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,493
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

1084
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,702
- Right now?
- Absolutely.

1085
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,541
- Would you take over for me, please?
- Oh, sure.

1086
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,343
What's up?

1087
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,247
- Things good?
- Yeah, thing are good.

1088
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,178
Classes are good, and...

1089
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,922
- Yeah, classes are good.
- Learning a lot of new stuff?

1090
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,519
What the hell do you want?

1091
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,930
How much would it cost?

1092
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,770
How much would what cost?

1093
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,674
- Counseling.
- Counseling?

1094
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,507
Yes. What are you, a parrot?
Gotta repeat everything I say?

1095
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,445
Counseling!

1096
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,710
Look, you're almost a
psychologist now, right?

1097
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,652
So... how much
would a session cost?

1098
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,552
You want me to be
your psychologist?

1099
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,716
Yes! But...

1100
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,826
we can't tell anybody.

1101
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:33,852
Of course not.

1102
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,688
I'm a professional.

1103
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,326
But, you know...

1104
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,034
Jeez, Jake.

1105
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,404
- You're my boss.
- I know.

1106
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,239
And that's why we gotta
keep this between us, OK?

1107
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,336
Very professional, just...

1108
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,314
You treat me just
like any other patient.

1109
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,840
OK, but I'd have to
charge you $20 an hour.

1110
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,152
- $20 an hour?
- Yeah.

1111
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,180
I pay you twice that in the market!
You go to school to make less money?

1112
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,955
- It's not all about money, Jake.
- I'm just saying,

1113
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,588
- you use your education just to...
- OK. All right. 40.

1114
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,963
40. All right? You
want the session or not?

1115
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,524
- I think so.
- Good.

1116
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,230
- Think so.
- All right. When do you want it?

1117
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,899
- Well, when's good for you?
- I don't know.

1118
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,498
- Now?
- Now works.

1119
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,100
- Now works.
- I could...

1120
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,135
- Now?
- I can do... Yeah.

1121
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,509
- OK.
- OK.

1122
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,346
- So, what do we...
- Why don't you have a seat?

1123
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,251
And I'll have a seat,
and... we can start.

1124
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,686
- OK.
- I don't like this.

1125
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,485
- Why don't we switch?
- I don't...

1126
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,583
Get over here.
See, this is better.

1127
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,753
Yeah...

1128
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,894
That's good. Now...

1129
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,126
Like that. All right.

1130
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,294
Here we are.

1131
01:01:58,748 --> 01:01:59,806
So.

1132
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,608
Mr. Bianchi.

1133
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,212
Tell me how your
troubles began.

1134
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,223
Do we really have to act like
this? We're in a fish market.

1135
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,715
Yes! You want a professional
working relationship.

1136
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:14,161
Please answer the questions.

1137
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,063
She's six years
older than me, and...

1138
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,466
- She?
- Marisa, jackass.

1139
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,732
- Marisa?
- Am I really paying you $40 an hour...

1140
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,763
just to repeat
everything I say, Steve?

1141
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,436
50. And I'll charge you even more
if you keep on being difficult.

1142
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,038
- That's what doctors do.
- Psychologists aren't doctors.

1143
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,241
Whatever.

1144
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,740
If she is indeed six years
older than you, Mr. Bianchi,

1145
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,084
I suggest to you, in the
vernacular, that you dump her.

1146
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,219
- What?
- See, this... this woman...

1147
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,022
was playing tonsil hockey
in the playground of life...

1148
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,756
while you were a
mere spermatozoa...

1149
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:50,163
- in your father's scrotal sac.
- Look, Steve, I'm in a bind here, man.

1150
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,895
I got an entire relationship,
everything's based on lies.

1151
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,631
- I see, Mr. Bianchi.
- Bianski.

1152
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,935
- I'm not Italian.
- Coulda had me fooled.

1153
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,374
And I'm not even in a real
relationship with Isabella.

1154
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,639
Now, finally, we're
getting somewhere.

1155
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,841
Not a meaningful relationship
with Isabella. But...

1156
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,544
If I'm gonna make this work with
her, I gotta tell her the truth.

1157
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,711
No! Absolutely not.

1158
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,221
The truth never helps anyone.

1159
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,953
See, relationships are delicate enough
without the truth messing things up.

1160
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,928
You see, the truth is
like pure oxygen, hm?

1161
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,159
It can kill you. It's gotta
be mixed in with other things.

1162
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,759
What? Am I... Am I really
paying you for this advice?

1163
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,032
If you love someone,
embrace them.

1164
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,436
And if the truth
helps, well, flaunt it.

1165
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,737
If it doesn't, avoid
the truth like a plague,

1166
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:37,075
like a pestilence that should
be driven from the valley.

1167
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,107
The valley.

1168
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,141
Fathers and sons, they say
horrible things to one another...

1169
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,813
that should never be repeated.

1170
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,788
Most of them truthful.

1171
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,724
But what's important
is how they feel.

1172
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,319
That's what counts.

1173
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,231
You learnt all
this stuff studying?

1174
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,792
Come on, Jake, you don't get
this shit out of a textbook, hm?

1175
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,827
This is life, man. Life!

1176
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,731
And yours truly has lived it.

1177
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,139
'Scuse me, ladies.

1178
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,973
Look. Before I forget...

1179
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,104
I need to get off early
tonight, I got plans.

1180
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,808
Well, you're the boss.

1181
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,580
I'm going to the community college
to sign up for some evening classes.

1182
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,281
- English literature.
- You gotta be kidding me. You too?

1183
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:22,155
Hey, I'm not gonna spend my
whole life in this fish market.

1184
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,421
- I got dreams too.
- English literature?

1185
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,088
You love fish.

1186
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,962
Whatever, man. Go study
Shakespeare. I don't care.

1187
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,559
I always knew you had a thing
for guys in tights anyway.

1188
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,366
Yeah. Well, thanks
for the support.

1189
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,167
You got it.

1190
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,534
She's taking me to
her faculty dinner.

1191
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:44,034
Don't go. Intellectuals, though
I count myself among them...

1192
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,514
are very cliquey if
you're not on their level.

1193
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,949
Jake. You should have at least
had some good years of sex...

1194
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,543
before this bullshit started.

1195
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,714
I mean, at a minimum, you
should have seen her nipples.

1196
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,651
Hey.

1197
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,997
- You can't wear that.
- Why not?

1198
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,398
Because you can't
wear khaki to a formal.

1199
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,493
- Let me just... Can I...
- Whoa.

1200
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,027
If you don't want to take me
as I am, why not take Michael?

1201
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,439
Because I wanna take you.
Now just look nice for me.

1202
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,205
Here. Try this on.

1203
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,974
No. I can't wear that.

1204
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:21,882
OK. What about this one?

1205
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,408
No! None of these.

1206
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,182
- Why do you want a suit...
- This is... Let me just see.

1207
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,080
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

1208
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,116
What's this?

1209
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,019
This.

1210
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,367
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah. These are my...

1211
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,396
my anniversary suits.

1212
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,102
If you really love someone...

1213
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,840
they don't need
something like this.

1214
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,750
All right. Why don't you
tell me what you can wear?

1215
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,949
This? Well, if it's
good enough for me...

1216
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,684
it's good enough
for Ivy League snobs.

1217
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,249
They're not snobs.
They're intellectuals.

1218
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,386
Intellectuals bore me.

1219
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,454
I won't have anything
to talk about with them.

1220
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,727
You're gonna have a
good time, I promise.

1221
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:14,202
Yeah, we do all our neutering
by laser now. We love it.

1222
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:17,103
- What about spaying?
- Spaying's a little tricky.

1223
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,607
I think you still need the
human touch for that one.

1224
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,805
Tonight's a very
special night.

1225
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,815
I am happy to present...

1226
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,615
this year's Vets Without Borders
Award for Excellence in Research...

1227
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,121
to Dr. Marisa Costa...

1228
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,716
for her outstanding work
with the Italian greyhound.

1229
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,155
Careful, people.
She's showing you up.

1230
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,266
So, here's to Dr. Costa...

1231
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,294
one of our most
cherished colleagues...

1232
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,898
and her pursuit of knowledge.

1233
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,677
You were getting an award
and you didn't tell me?

1234
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,273
You don't ask about my work.

1235
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,342
It's not just an award.

1236
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,822
It's a grant. A
$500,000 endowment.

1237
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,416
Not bad for four years
out of veterinarian school.

1238
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,393
That's what I mean. $500,000,
you're not gonna tell me that?

1239
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,453
- You wouldn't have come.
- I would have come.

1240
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,465
What is it you do, Jack?

1241
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:21,265
- I work in a fish market.
- A fish market?

1242
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,137
- You sell fish?
- He's being modest.

1243
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,199
He owns it.

1244
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,006
So you're a businessman.

1245
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,039
Of sorts, yeah.

1246
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,879
Speaking of business,
Susan got a promotion.

1247
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,545
- She got tenure at the university.
- Congratulations.

1248
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,986
- Excellent.
- And a pretty nice pay raise.

1249
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,819
85,000 a year.

1250
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,359
That's it?

1251
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,125
I'm... I'm just
saying, I mean...

1252
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,862
You're a professor.
That's all you make?

1253
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,632
That's actually a
very good salary.

1254
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,231
- How do you live?
- Excuse me?

1255
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,402
I just mean... I pay that
out in a bad year, so...

1256
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:05,005
Wait a minute. A
fishmonger makes 85,000?

1257
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,345
Yeah.

1258
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,910
- Really?
- It's good to be a monger.

1259
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,246
The goal of North
End Fisheries...

1260
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,485
is to consistently increase
our annual profit margin.

1261
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,255
I just recently raised
prices in the shop.

1262
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:23,061
People will spend more, because they
feel they're getting a better product.

1263
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,691
As long as I keep
my costs down...

1264
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:28,032
my revenues are out of
the red and into the green.

1265
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,833
- Yeah.
- Theoretically...

1266
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,238
let's say you had some
inside information...

1267
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,708
from a certain
veterinary researcher...

1268
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:38,338
about a new strain
of avian flu...

1269
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,044
that had the potential to kill
off the entire feline population.

1270
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,617
How could I make
money off that?

1271
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:50,955
Well, I guess, in that...
horrendous scenario...

1272
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,884
you could make
a small fortune...

1273
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:56,363
short-selling pet supply
manufacturing companies...

1274
01:08:56,398 --> 01:09:01,358
and at the same time investing in
companies that produce pet... coffins.

1275
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,203
Anyway, guys, I
hope it was helpful.

1276
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,040
I don't know, I just figured, you know, if
you're smart enough to get into Harvard...

1277
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:11,205
you might as well be financially
smart enough to pay for it.

1278
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,115
You really think that guy's gonna
call me in to be a guest lecturer?

1279
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,125
Probably. He loved you.

1280
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:27,528
Oh, man. Me, the high-school
dropout, a college lecturer?

1281
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,554
It would be so freaking cool.

1282
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,790
You think they were
just humoring me?

1283
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:36,202
Like I really just stuck out, like
a hooker at a convent or something?

1284
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,604
That's your
baggage, not theirs.

1285
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,233
Why are you so upset?

1286
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,767
I'm not upset, it's just...

1287
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,343
- You know.
- No.

1288
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,510
- What's up?
- It was my night.

1289
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:54,455
But I was eclipsed, and
not even by my boyfriend.

1290
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,651
- Come here.
- No.

1291
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,254
If I'm gonna be
overshadowed...

1292
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,196
I would at least like
it to be by someone...

1293
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,665
who basks in me when
I get home at night.

1294
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,666
Me.

1295
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,333
- Good night.
- Good night?

1296
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,172
You...

1297
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,101
Seriously?

1298
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,161
Hello?

1299
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,999
Hey.

1300
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,028
Can you buzz me up?

1301
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,036
You need a slumber party.

1302
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,594
I was thinking more of
an adult slumber party.

1303
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:14,000
No!

1304
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,698
Adult slumber parties
aren't as much fun.

1305
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,440
You just gonna stand there,
or are you gonna come help me?

1306
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,163
Nice.

1307
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,766
You see that line over there?

1308
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,008
The one that
represents friendship.

1309
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,950
I think it's safe to say
that we've crossed that one.

1310
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,181
- You know what Freud says?
- Yeah.

1311
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:14,254
He'd say I'd rather be
making out with my mom.

1312
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,914
Hey!

1313
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,441
Beautiful day. Beautiful day!

1314
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,351
- How you doing?
- So.

1315
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:43,017
- So?
- How's the therapy going? Eh?

1316
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,019
I'm not... I'm not in therapy.

1317
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:49,030
Why would you even say
something like that?

1318
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,329
Is Steve. He tell
us all about your...

1319
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,336
sessions.

1320
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,270
But don't worry.

1321
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,796
Your secret is safe with me.

1322
01:12:58,841 --> 01:12:59,830
He told you that?

1323
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,213
You know, you need
it for some time now.

1324
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,656
<i>Ah, Marisa! Buonglorno.</i>

1325
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,128
You've got the glow!

1326
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,897
Oh, believe me,
there's no glow.

1327
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:31,030
It's more of a flame.

1328
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,870
I don't care. Most historians
would disagree with you.

1329
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,944
I don't care what
most historians say.

1330
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,612
I lived through it.

1331
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,644
And I am telling you...

1332
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,020
Italy was never
part of the Axis.

1333
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,719
- Yes, they were.
- No!

1334
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,591
They were not.

1335
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:56,029
Is this before
or after the war?

1336
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,261
Before or after! The Italian people
were always part of the Allies.

1337
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,566
- What?
- As for Mussolini himself...

1338
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,595
That's another story.

1339
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,074
Are you shitting me?

1340
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,906
Is Jake here? I
need to speak to him.

1341
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,578
- What the hell do you want?
- Look, I just need some help. Please?

1342
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,244
- It's not gonna happen.
- No way.

1343
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,719
Oh, God. It's been eight
years. You still can't be mad.

1344
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,588
Time heals most wounds, but
Jake is like a homophiliac...

1345
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,286
- No, no. Hemophiliac.
- Yeah, hemophiliac.

1346
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:27,761
He... he still bleeds.

1347
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,788
Yeah, well, he doesn't
have to bleed anymore.

1348
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,824
'Cause I'm back.

1349
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,035
She's what?

1350
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,137
It took you eight
years to realize this?

1351
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,666
Look, I'm sorry that I
was slower than you, but...

1352
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,807
I'm here now.

1353
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,274
If you want me.

1354
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,679
Just help me!

1355
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,324
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea, huh?

1356
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,351
No. Are you kidding me?

1357
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,828
This... this is...

1358
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:04,833
This is the best
day of my life. I...

1359
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,926
This is what I've been
dreaming of, right?

1360
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,733
- You don't act like it.
- I don't know.

1361
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,239
You guys, you showed
up so unexpectedly...

1362
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,638
I just wasn't sure
what to do, that's all.

1363
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,909
Well, be excited.

1364
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,382
This is what you and I
have always wanted, right?

1365
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,476
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

1366
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,216
This... this is all good.

1367
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,049
We're soulmates, so...

1368
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,120
Hey, sweetie.

1369
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,155
You gonna play?

1370
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,966
- So, how's it going?
- Yeah.

1371
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:46,736
No, it's great,
you know? It's...

1372
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,642
It's everything I've
been dreaming of, so...

1373
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,873
- It's good, yeah.
- Is it?

1374
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,782
Do you want my professional
opinion or my honest opinion?

1375
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,411
- Which one's more important?
- Oh, they both are.

1376
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,580
- Then give me both.
- OK.

1377
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:04,251
- Professional opinion first?
- I don't care. Just give me one.

1378
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,693
Well, let's see. My
professional opinion is...

1379
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,288
that you get the heck outta
town, you get into your truck...

1380
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,323
move to another state and don't
tell anybody where you're going, now.

1381
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,892
- Come on, man, I'm being serious here.
- So am I!

1382
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,700
Her husband's gonna kill you.

1383
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,206
He is. He's Italian, you know.

1384
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,210
You know what? If you're just gonna
stand out there and listen anyway...

1385
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:26,840
why don't you just come in, pull up
a chair and join my therapy session?

1386
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,816
You asked.

1387
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,943
Hey, Pop. Get the
counter, will you?

1388
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:35,087
- It's fine, I left a note.
- Him too?

1389
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:38,889
He's gonna tell me everything
anyway, so, save time.

1390
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,418
I ask you as a friend, Jake,
don't pull us into this.

1391
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,260
Your life is shit.

1392
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,095
How are you gonna
keep any clients?

1393
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,624
How are you gonna
keep your balls?

1394
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,600
Is this a meeting of minds?

1395
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,506
Yeah, something like that.

1396
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,238
Hi, boys.

1397
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,643
<i>Hola.</i>

1398
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,647
- How you doing?
- Hey, Jake.

1399
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,672
What's up?

1400
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,689
- What are these?
- They're just... They're some...

1401
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,520
Fish tags.

1402
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,719
- Did the Girl Scouts write these?
- No, they're...

1403
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,059
- Like he said, they're fish tags.
- You see, this is a fish market.

1404
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,258
- Is it really? Thank you.
- Yes.

1405
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,693
Well, we're gonna go for
a walk. You wanna come?

1406
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:24,172
Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm just
gonna... take a minute with these guys.

1407
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,935
- I'll meet you outside, OK?
- OK.

1408
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,238
Go on.

1409
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,537
See you, boys.

1410
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,772
Yeah. Whatever. Keep in touch.

1411
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,216
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1412
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,193
I know a guy, he
makes problems go away.

1413
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:48,094
- Your kind of problem.
- Yeah, Frankie the jeweler's cousin.

1414
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:53,025
You're never gonna
know what happened.

1415
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,894
You just know...

1416
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:57,928
she don't come back.

1417
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:03,066
- You got it!
- Hey.

1418
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,441
They hate me.

1419
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,676
No... Yeah, they
do. They really do.

1420
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:13,244
- Do you hate me?
- No, I don't hate you.

1421
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,785
Hey! You!

1422
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,928
Isabella, this is Marisa.

1423
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,958
Marisa, Isabella.

1424
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:31,130
You're Marisa?

1425
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,266
I've heard so much about you.

1426
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,013
I... I'm gonna... You just...

1427
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,147
Marisa!

1428
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:51,586
Marisa! Marisa!

1429
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,355
Come on!

1430
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,056
Marisa!

1431
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,324
God!

1432
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,491
How are you so fast?

1433
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,936
Oh, what a tangled
up web we weave...

1434
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:09,068
When first we
practice to deceive...

1435
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,444
<i>- Like the song says.
- It's not a song, it's Shakespeare, papa.</i>

1436
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,142
- Huh?
- No, that's not.

1437
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,343
It's Sir Walter Scott.

1438
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,284
No, forget the poetry.

1439
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,083
Because right now, you
got an opportunity...

1440
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,920
to exploit Marisa's
latent lesbian side.

1441
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,860
<i>Now, maybe you invite Isabella to
join you two in a little mnage, hm?</i>

1442
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:30,023
- A bit like a mini scrum!
- Yeah, no, just... just like a scrum.

1443
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,390
That's my boy.

1444
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,460
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1445
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,169
What... Oh, no.

1446
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,050
We already fixed
your fish. Sir!

1447
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,212
- It's my son, OK?
- Your son?

1448
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,222
- Just...
- No, I have to...

1449
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:57,419
- My acquaintance's son, and I gotta...
- Sir!

1450
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,723
His pet is gonna die
if we don't hurry up.

1451
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:08,228
- Your antics aren't gonna work.
- They're not antics.

1452
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,535
I swear... We just... We
needed you to help Chuckie.

1453
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,133
Jake, these rodents
carry diseases.

1454
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,037
Honey, honey, can I have this?

1455
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,513
- Can I take this?
- It's OK.

1456
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,779
Just let me look at it
real quick, OK, honey?

1457
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,218
- She's gonna help Chuckie, all right?
- Thank you.

1458
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:27,187
- She's gonna help fix Chuckie.
- Yeah.

1459
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,621
All right?

1460
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,919
My God! What are you...

1461
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,949
What is wrong with
veterinary caution?

1462
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,090
Really?

1463
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,860
There you go. There you go.

1464
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,890
Can I talk to you a minute?

1465
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,768
What, you can't just throw
a kid's pet in the trash can.

1466
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,640
- What kind of mother will you be?
- At this rate, I won't be one at all.

1467
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,201
But that rat is dead.

1468
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,009
Then I need you to, like,
cardiovert it, or something.

1469
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,972
- What part of "dead" did you miss?
- Just fix it!

1470
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,542
OK? Switch it with another
one, he'll never know.

1471
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,954
This is not a pet store,
it's a doctor's office.

1472
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:05,084
Well, it's a veterinarian's
office, but...

1473
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,360
What's this about?

1474
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:10,364
It's about a...
a kid and his pet.

1475
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,730
- And that's it?
- Yeah.

1476
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:15,759
- That's it.
- You knew it was dead.

1477
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,669
But you came here anyway.

1478
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,674
It's an excuse, Jake, it...

1479
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,836
You really think that I would use a
kid's tragedy as my own personal gain?

1480
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,641
- Yeah.
- Wh...

1481
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:29,845
You do look nice. That the
sweater that I bought you?

1482
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,945
- Get out of my office.
- Why are you so pissed?

1483
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:36,253
I told you that I had a
girlfriend from the beginning.

1484
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,316
I thought we
crossed that line.

1485
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,390
Get out, Jake. Out. I mean it.

1486
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,091
You knew that we
were only friends.

1487
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:48,501
Yeah, well, you know what? Maybe
I just didn't wanna believe it.

1488
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,931
Hey, buddy.

1489
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,609
I'll buy you a new Chuckie.

1490
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,753
Hello?

1491
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,096
Let me speak to my
wife, you son of a bitch.

1492
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,459
It's for you.

1493
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,008
I tried. She doesn't
wanna talk to you.

1494
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,568
When I'm through with you...

1495
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,775
your balls are gonna be floating
in a Tupperware container.

1496
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:38,711
OK, just wait there a minute.
Hold on. I'll be right down.

1497
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,516
What?

1498
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,551
You know what your
problem is, man?

1499
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,360
You don't understand women.

1500
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,056
You don't.

1501
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,997
You know, you gotta
make 'em feel special...

1502
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,398
like, romance 'em and stuff.

1503
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,926
Buy 'em presents.
Women love presents.

1504
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,871
She's my wife.

1505
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,739
Not getting anywhere
with that attitude.

1506
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,568
They wanna feel like they're the
only person in the world, man.

1507
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,877
You know, like they're wanted.

1508
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,616
I'm serious. You tell
a woman one nice thing...

1509
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,383
you can be banging
her in no time.

1510
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:16,913
I don't wanna "bang" anyone.

1511
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,949
I want my family back.

1512
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,656
Hello? Am I talking
to myself here?

1513
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,220
I want you to have
'em back too, man.

1514
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,858
I got a room full of kids
upstairs, you kiddin' me?

1515
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,095
But you gotta win
her back from me.

1516
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:31,367
Otherwise, she's not
gonna respect you.

1517
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:35,206
If you didn't want her, then
why did you destroy my family?

1518
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,733
Des... Come on. It's just...

1519
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,406
You know, people always
want what they can't have.

1520
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:42,280
The grass is always greener on
the other side, that sort of thing.

1521
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,182
You're gonna get
her back from me.

1522
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:47,245
You just gotta chase her.
They love being chased.

1523
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,984
It's what they want.
It's not so hard.

1524
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,361
You're an asshole. You
don't deserve Isabella.

1525
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,729
- I know.
- Or any other woman, for that matter.

1526
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,631
Oh, I know.

1527
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:00,827
Another beer?

1528
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,860
Does the Pope
shit in the woods?

1529
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:09,306
Hello!

1530
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:14,611
Marisa! Answer the door! I know
you wanna talk to me too. It's...

1531
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,482
Shut your piehole down
there, we're trying to sleep!

1532
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,714
- Piss off, Blondie.
- Honey, get over here.

1533
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:23,588
- There's a crazy person at the window.
- I know, man.

1534
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,559
- I'm not coming down.
- Just...

1535
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,356
- Hey!
- I need to talk to you.

1536
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,693
- Then talk.
- Sweetie, call the cops.

1537
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,564
- I think it's gonna fall off.
- What?

1538
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,967
- My cock! My johnson!
- I'll cut your cock off.

1539
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,336
- Jake, stop it.
- I did what you said.

1540
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:41,069
I... I stopped having sex
with the sheep, and then the...

1541
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,077
- The chickens got jealous.
- Please stop it.

1542
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:46,410
- Get the hell outta here!
- Let... Come on, a little bit.

1543
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,645
- It's nothing weird or anything, just...
- Jake!

1544
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,479
- I like to have sex with farm animals!
- Shut up down there!

1545
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,386
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You introduced me to 'em.

1546
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,618
Is it so wrong? Is it?

1547
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,127
- Veterinarian Marisa Costa?
- Oh, my God.

1548
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,254
- Apartment 302?
- Come in.

1549
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,094
You drunken bum!

1550
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:11,561
Hi.

1551
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,097
There's nothing you can
say that I wanna hear, Jake.

1552
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,973
OK, fine, maybe... maybe not.

1553
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,740
But... there's something
I have to tell you.

1554
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,106
Go for it.

1555
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,545
I'm not Italian.

1556
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,258
Go home, Jake. You're drunk.

1557
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,557
You're drunk.

1558
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,755
Marisa!

1559
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,035
I'm Polish.

1560
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,979
I'm watching you, creep.

1561
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,394
Hey, buddy.

1562
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,040
Oh, my God!

1563
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,017
- Oh, my God!
- Turn it off!

1564
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,281
What are you...
what are you doing?

1565
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,847
- What?
- Mario told me everything.

1566
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,723
I'm leaving you,
Jake. In the morning.

1567
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,024
Then what the hell are
you still doing in my bed?

1568
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,553
I didn't wanna wake the kids.

1569
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,589
Oh, this is just great.

1570
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,316
<i>- You read this?
- Old Man And The Sea?</i>

1571
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,147
Yeah, it's awesome.

1572
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:16,163
That's it. I'm turning gay.

1573
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,529
From here on out,
it's dick for me.

1574
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:22,628
- It's genetic. It's not your choice.
- Not true. Not true.

1575
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:25,036
Freud says there's
a sexual continuum.

1576
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:29,134
Freud's not always right. Pursuit
of sausage, it's definitely genetic.

1577
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,701
Enough! OK?

1578
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:34,146
Oh, do we need to explore anger
management in our next session?

1579
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:37,117
I can't deal with you today.
You've both gotta go. Get out!

1580
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,516
- Out. Out!
- Hey, Jake.

1581
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,783
- What?
- I'll set you up with my cousin.

1582
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,881
<i>- He loves a braclola.
- What?</i>

1583
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:46,018
What are you doing? What is
he doing? Where are you going?

1584
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,584
Should have done
this a long time ago.

1585
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,654
- What are you...
- It's for your own good.

1586
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,460
- Huh?
- Anger is a desperate cry for help.

1587
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:52,761
- Get out. Out!
- It is!

1588
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,461
- Out!
- OK. All right, all right.

1589
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:56,493
Don't push.

1590
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,166
What don't you understand?

1591
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,177
She's not here.

1592
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,003
Fine!

1593
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,713
- You can't be here.
- I'm not leaving till I see her.

1594
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,688
Then you will shrivel
up and die waiting.

1595
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,296
Hey. Stalker boy!

1596
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,426
It's time to go.

1597
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,028
I told you I'm not
leaving until I see her.

1598
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,471
You can't see her.
She's not here.

1599
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:35,772
She went to Italy.
Vets Without Borders?

1600
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,635
I've been here all day long.

1601
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,410
Why didn't you say something?

1602
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,913
We did!

1603
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,942
She's my soulmate.

1604
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,557
There's no such
thing as a soulmate.

1605
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,957
You only want her 'cause
you can't have her.

1606
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,155
When you met this broad,
you denied the window.

1607
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,255
- Now you're stuck on the other side.
- I love her.

1608
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:59,266
If you love her, how
come you banged Isabella?

1609
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,530
- I didn't bang Isabella.
- Yeah, but you would have.

1610
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,901
You just didn't have enough
time. It's transferring.

1611
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:05,269
Transference.

1612
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,570
You desperately cling to
relationships that don't work,

1613
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,270
in order to hold on
to your dead parents.

1614
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,404
Oh, now this is
about my parents.

1615
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:13,675
Yes!

1616
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:18,084
It has nothing to do with feelings,
or... or concern over finding a soulmate?

1617
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,587
Isabella is a
literal metaphor.

1618
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:24,789
There's no such thing
as a literal metaphor.

1619
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,225
She's a simile.

1620
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,387
Mr. Walt Whitman here
takes three night classes,

1621
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,897
all of a sudden, he's a
doctor of English literature.

1622
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:34,959
- Huh?
- Look. Isabella represents your parents.

1623
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:37,163
Marisa is letting go and
accepting their deaths.

1624
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,799
Oh, that's deep. You learn
that at night school too?

1625
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:43,140
You don't need night school for that.
Try second grade. It's basic stuff.

1626
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:46,704
Oh, basic stuff? It's only the basis
of modern psychoanalytic theory.

1627
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,182
If you're calling
Freud a second-grader.

1628
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,084
You know what? If Freud's
theories are based on similes...

1629
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,317
- then I guess I'm calling him that.
- Freud was full of shit. How about that?

1630
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:58,416
- The first stage is anger.
- I'm not angry, Steve.

1631
01:29:58,459 --> 01:29:59,653
Then denial.

1632
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:04,222
You know, when I was your age,
they didn't have airplanes.

1633
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,324
They've had airplanes
since the 1920s.

1634
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:08,733
Commercial airplanes, been
around since the 1920s.

1635
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:12,331
Details, details. If you
want Marisa, fly to her.

1636
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,807
Fly! You know,
like the song says.

1637
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:17,333
- What song?
- If they wrote one.

1638
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,092
She's my soulmate.

1639
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:34,686
They don't have
air-conditioning in Italy.

1640
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:37,027
I don't know why, maybe
they got it from the Greeks.

1641
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:41,057
So, you gotta take some
newspaper, dip it in water,

1642
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,868
wrap it around to keep
it moist and fresh.

1643
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:46,396
Got it?

1644
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,671
Now, Francesca will
take care of everything.

1645
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:50,734
- But don't screw this up.
- I won't screw it up.

1646
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,575
- I like this girl.
- I do too.

1647
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,205
And I want you to
come back with this.

1648
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:55,875
- OK. All right.
- OK?

1649
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:57,746
I'll kill you if you don't.

1650
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:02,979
It's a beautiful ring.

1651
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,049
Jackie, do me a favor.

1652
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,151
Take this for Frankie, and...

1653
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,495
load it up with a lot
of costume jewelry...

1654
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,625
so the customs'll
never know, OK?

1655
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,693
- Go ahead. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1656
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,937
My cousin there,
he'll take care of you.

1657
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,638
Alessandro has the finest
fabrics in all the world.

1658
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:27,375
Except for here. The cut...

1659
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,374
All right. Thanks, Silvano.

1660
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,155
Hi.

1661
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:14,628
Do-a you-a
speak-a English?

1662
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,287
<i>- Slgnor Bianchi.
- Yeah!</i>

1663
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:24,403
Hi. Jake. How you doing?

1664
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:29,235
You-a Aunt-a
Theresa...

1665
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:33,577
said you could-a
help-a me out.

1666
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,723
<i>Buonglorno.</i>

1667
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,228
You speak English?

1668
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,470
You speak, like, a
little bit of English?

1669
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,740
A little.

1670
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,770
I need to find a guest.

1671
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:10,043
Veterinarian Marisa Costa?

1672
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:14,512
<i>Si, abblamo una
Dottoressa Costa.</i>

1673
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:19,390
<i>No, no. No, no  una
dottoressa.  una veterlnarla.</i>

1674
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:24,057
<i>No.  una Dottoressa.
Dottoressa Costa. Spagnola.</i>

1675
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,431
<i>No, no, uh, veterlnarla
Costa. Itallana.</i>

1676
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:30,164
<i>No, non  Itallana.
 spagnola.</i>

1677
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,968
<i>La Dottoressa
Costa  spagnola.</i>

1678
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,441
She's Italian. I
know she's Italian.

1679
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:38,001
She told me she's Italian.

1680
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,172
So, there you go.

1681
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,280
<i>Dottoressa Costa. Spagnola.</i>

1682
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,294
I need a room next to hers.

1683
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,128
I... I need a...
I need a... To sl...

1684
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:03,227
<i>Sleep, dormlre... next to her
room. I wanna be her neighbor.</i>

1685
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,127
Perfect. How many nights, sir?

1686
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:36,035
Marisa, I know I was a jerk.

1687
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,833
And I'm sorry.

1688
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:42,240
But... I love you so much.

1689
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:46,110
And I wanna spend the
rest of my life with you.

1690
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,710
Besides, you lied too.

1691
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:54,982
You're Spanish.

1692
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:00,656
Don't say that, Jake. Don't.

1693
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,658
Soulmates.

1694
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:17,474
Hey. Can I help you?

1695
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,746
Yeah. I was... I
was looking for my...

1696
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:26,077
For my...

1697
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,486
Do you... do you
have any shampoo?

1698
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:32,349
- Shampoo?
- Yeah.

1699
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:36,695
- Yeah. Yeah. Hold on.
- OK.

1700
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:46,205
- There you go. It's my girlfriend's.
- Yeah.

1701
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,208
- Your girlfriend's.
- Yeah.

1702
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,767
Yeah, so's the robe.

1703
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:53,871
You know, just keep it. I'll
tell her the maid took it.

1704
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,245
OK. Bye-bye.

1705
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:10,190
You know what I would
love to do tomorrow?

1706
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:13,098
- Let's... let's go for a hike.
- I can't, I have to work.

1707
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,227
I have to be up at, like, six.

1708
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,034
OK...

1709
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:20,540
<i>Well, you know what?
Let's go get some gelato.</i>

1710
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:22,166
<i>- Gelato?
- Right now. Come on.</i>

1711
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:24,404
- Really? They got cable.
- I know.

1712
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,742
- The cable here?
- Yeah.

1713
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,680
- Three channels.
- I know, but...

1714
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,411
Did you see the
German one? I'm sorry.

1715
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:36,148
Jake.

1716
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:38,522
This is Michael.

1717
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,789
Michael, this is Jake.

1718
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:43,592
- Jake... Boston Jake?
- Michael?

1719
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,294
- Hey. I've heard a lot about you.
- I thought he was limp in the sack.

1720
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:48,926
- I'm sorry. What?
- That's what I heard.

1721
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,960
Jake.

1722
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:56,766
Will you marry me?

1723
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,105
No! No, get up.

1724
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:05,482
Come on. This thing's
burning a hole in my pocket.

1725
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,520
- I thought you two were just friends.
- We are.

1726
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:12,549
I miss you so much.

1727
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:15,921
I just wanna be with you.

1728
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:19,131
Hey, she said no, so...

1729
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,259
if you don't mind,
could you leave us alone?

1730
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:22,667
It's our anniversary.

1731
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:25,194
Two weeks ago this very
day, I gave her an orgasm...

1732
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:27,434
that you couldn't possibly
touch with a vibrator.

1733
01:37:27,474 --> 01:37:29,101
Enough, Jake. Seriously.

1734
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,940
You're kidding, right?

1735
01:37:30,978 --> 01:37:31,967
Right?

1736
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:36,613
This is between Marisa and
me. This doesn't concern you.

1737
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,345
You mess with my woman?

1738
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,156
Will you marry me?

1739
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:47,517
Get up.

1740
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:49,652
- Come on. Get up. Up, up, up!
- What?

1741
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,756
Get up.

1742
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:54,029
You messed with my woman.

1743
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:57,265
I'm gonna kill you. Yeah, and then
I'm gonna cut off your balls...

1744
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:58,862
and I'm gonna
have 'em bronzed.

1745
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,567
What... what's with the balls?

1746
01:38:00,608 --> 01:38:03,099
- I mean, you Italian guys.
- You got a Greek complex?

1747
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:04,804
- Greek complex. That's good.
- Oh, no.

1748
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:07,143
- Rearrange your furniture.
- I like your peach shirt.

1749
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:09,706
Oh, you like
peach? Look at you.

1750
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,819
Where are you going?
You're running in circles.

1751
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:15,014
- I can do this all night.
- You can't.

1752
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:17,319
You asked me if I had a dream.

1753
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:22,958
You're my dream. I love you.

1754
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:25,793
No, Michael, don't hurt him.

1755
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,528
You want a hug?

1756
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,154
- Marisa.
- Good morning.

1757
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:54,224
Where am I?

1758
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:03,929
Are you OK?

1759
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,032
Did I win?

1760
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:09,065
Yeah. You won.

1761
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,742
Now get up.

1762
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,582
You get up.

1763
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:21,848
We're going for a run.

1764
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:24,884
No way.

1765
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:28,487
I can't take
another ass-kicking.

1766
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:41,264
You don't have to humor me.
You can run ahead if you want.

1767
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:45,005
- Your poor face.
- I'm fine. Promise.

1768
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:47,138
- I don't remember your answer.
- My answer?

1769
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:49,172
Well, are you
going to marry me?

1770
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:51,480
- Can you beat me to the rocks?
- No.

1771
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:54,851
- Well, could you at least try?
- Are you... I don't wanna...

1772
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:16,718
You know no one's gonna buy your
philosophical bullshit, don't you?

1773
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:19,817
Sure they will! A psychologist who's
more screwed up than his patients?

1774
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,385
How can anyone not be cured?

1775
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:24,192
Steve, why don't
you just stay here?

1776
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:27,166
Go to Harvard with me. They
got some great master programs.

1777
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:29,761
Between us, we could have
psychology into the sixth grade.

1778
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:32,636
No, no. I'm through with
Boston, and this weather.

1779
01:43:32,673 --> 01:43:34,664
California's got
enough freaks already...

1780
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,541
- so I figured Arizona's going to be perfect.
- That's nice.

1781
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:40,604
- They don't know what they're in for.
- This would make a great picture.

1782
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:42,114
- Let's get one. I got it.
- Yeah.

1783
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:44,014
Pop, get in here and
take a picture, will you?

1784
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,383
Just a minute, please.

1785
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,412
Now, your last name Baba?

1786
01:43:49,456 --> 01:43:51,549
Baba. That's not Italian.

1787
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:53,150
No, it's Romanian.

1788
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:56,492
But Romania is called such
because of the Roman history.

1789
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:59,124
The Romans went into my city
of lai, which is in the east...

1790
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:05,429
Have you... have you
ever been to Italy?

1791
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:08,305
Yes, sir. When I was
15. I worked in a caf,

1792
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:10,435
but I did not speak the
language all that well.

1793
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:12,638
And a piece of paper...

1794
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:18,213
- You speak Italian?
- A little bit, I understand a lot.

1795
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,879
But I can learn more.

1796
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,751
Yeah. Do you like... fish?

1797
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:24,552
Oh, I love fish. I grew up by
a river, and I used to fish...

1798
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,219
Yeah. Can you clean a halibut?

1799
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,889
Oh, yes, very, very
quickly, and very clean, yes.

1800
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,091
<i>- Yes.
- Va bene.</i>

1801
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:34,396
Now, most important.

1802
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:36,561
Do you like Italians?

1803
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,997
Of course I love Italians.

1804
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,441
<i>- Everybody wants to be Italian!
- Oh, bravo, bravol</i>

1805
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:46,640
You got the job. All right,
all right. Can you start now?

1806
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,671
Yes.

1807
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,509
That's enough.

1808
