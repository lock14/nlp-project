1
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Hey!

2
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,700
Hey! Move it! Come on!
It's a green light!

3
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,200
Let's go!

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Come on!

5
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,099
Come on! Move it!

6
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,200
Sir? Open your window, sir.

7
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Okay! Okay!

8
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
Wait a minute.

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Sir?

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,700
I'm blind.

11
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Sir, open the window, please.

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Stay calm. Stay where you are
and tell me. What happened?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm blind. I'm blind!

14
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,499
It's like something's flooding my eyes.
I didn't do anything!

15
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,800
Right. It's probably nerves.

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,899
Should someone call
an ambulance?

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,300
Please, just take me to my apartment,
and my wife can help me.

18
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,800
I can take him.
I can drive him home.

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,199
Are you sure, sir?

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,100
Yes. Of course. We got to
get him off the street.

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Okay.

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
Okay, sir. I'll take
you to the other side.

23
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,800
It's.. It's just a blind guy.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,600
Ooh! Careful, take care of him.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Watch him. He can't see.

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,799
He's blind.

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,900
- If he's blind, why is he driving?
- I know.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,499
Here. Careful.

29
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Here we go, give me your hand.
Watch your head, please. Easy.

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,500
Okay. So, you can hear me, right?

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,899
Yeah.

32
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,599
Right. So just say
something if you need it,

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,400
and we'll have you
home in no time. Okay?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
Any questions?

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Why aren't we moving?

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,500
- Oh, it's a red light.
- Oh.

37
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:44,148
There's a movement to it.
Like light particles.

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Like light shining through a sea of
white. It feels like I'm swimming in milk.

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,400
Really? Well, one good thing is
I've never heard blindness

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,299
described as white. It's black, right?
It's the absence of light.

41
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,699
- So that's a good thing.
- I guess.

42
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,999
Yeah, sure it is.
It means it's not real blindness.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,399
Anyway, it's too fast.
Blindness is slow, right?

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
What you have is some
kind of psychosomatic,

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
some kind of nervous thing.

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,200
Just a second here, is
this where we're going?

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay, so.. Why don't
you just get out here.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,199
Okay. Walk to the curb.

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,300
All right.

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,899
- I got it.
- Walk to your left. Right there.

51
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,400
Hey! Hey!

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,000
Help!

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Help!

54
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,799
Help!

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't worry.

56
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,100
- I got you. You okay?
- Oh! Yeah.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,100
This your building? It's nice.

58
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,900
He's blind. Can't see.

59
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Just put your hand on that.. Careful.
Remember stairs, right?

60
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,100
What floor? I got it. I got it.

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
14th.

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
So, what are your problems?

63
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
- Sorry?
- What are you worried about?

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,499
Nothing unusual.

65
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,900
No? Any other symptoms,
like nervous symptoms?

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,100
No. My life is pretty
regular these days.

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Not a care in the world?
Life of leisure, huh?

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I don't know.

69
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Here we go.

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,199
Is anyone going to be at home,
or are you going to be alone?

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,300
There you go.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
Honey, I'm home.

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
- Thank you for everything..
- Nice place.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey. Hey.

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Did your wife design it here?

76
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,799
No. Listen, thank you
for everything.

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm so fine for now.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,699
Okay. Do you want me to stay here

79
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
and take care of you
until your wife gets home?

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,000
- Sure? It would make me feel better.
- I'm fine. Thank you.

82
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,099
- You sure? You want me to stay?
- I'm sure.

83
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,799
- No, thank you.
- All right.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Thank you very much. Thank you.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,685
Oh.. Wonderful!

86
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
I liked it so much..

87
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
Ouch!

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
Look at this..

89
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
You couldn't have cleaned it
up before you lay down?

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
Are you even listening?

91
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm not your maid.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
You're bleeding..

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,700
Are you okay?

94
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm blind.

95
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,400
Eye doctors, eye doctors..

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,500
Do we know any?

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,700
Let's just go to the hospital.

98
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,600
No way, they'll keep us
waiting for hours.

99
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
We're going to a specialist.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,700
I'd rather die
than stay like this!

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,900
Shut up!
You're confusing me..

102
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,500
My apologies..

103
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,399
- Honey?
- What?

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
So?

105
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
So what?

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Can you see anything?
Anything at all?

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,899
I see nothing.

108
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
- Try harder..
- What?

109
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Where are the car keys?

110
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:44,288
Take your keys.
You can look for mine later.

111
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Taxi!

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Are you sure you
looked everywhere?

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
Sure!

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,700
There's nothing
wrong with my eyes.

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,400
What kind of a person
steals from a blind man?

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
He should go blind.

117
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
You can come with me now, sir.
The doctor will see you.

118
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,599
Excuse me, but I've been waiting here
for over an hour. I'm with a child.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,700
Sorry. Doctor's orders.

120
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,099
Yeah, but my appointment
was at 6:00. It's now 7:00.

121
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,600
- We'll get to you as soon as we can.
- And it's not..

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Miss, Miss, let him go.
He's worse off than we are.

123
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:37,774
Nothing. Nothing in your lenses
and nothing in the retina.

124
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,399
Somebody just turned out the lights.

125
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,900
No, no, it's more like all
the lights were turned on.

126
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,400
Your eyes look perfect.

127
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,999
You see? I told you.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,999
Except I cannot see anything.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,299
Yes, and if this is true,

130
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,999
then we're going to have
to run some more tests.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Unfortunately we're not going
to be able to do that today.

132
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,199
What do you mean, if it's true?
You think I'm lying?

133
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
No, not at all.

134
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,899
But I have to be honest with you,

135
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,500
I've never experienced
anything like this before.

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,200
So, is that a prescription?

137
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,500
No, I'm actually writing
directions for the hospital.

138
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,699
I know how to get
to the hospital.

139
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
I don't need directions.

140
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,599
They're not for you.
They're for the staff.

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,199
So they know what to do
with your husband when he arrives.

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,300
Okay.

143
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
- So that's it?
- That's it for now.

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,799
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
We're going to find out what it is.

145
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,600
There's nothing else
we can do right now.

146
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
- And I just need a signature right there.
- Okay.

147
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm sorry. Not you, him.

148
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,200
- Oh!
- Me?

149
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
- Parking stand?
- We don't have a car.

150
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,700
Shit!

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Hey, hey, hey! What are
you doing? The road's closed!

152
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,300
What was that?

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
Fuck!

154
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
This is so fucking stupid.

155
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,000
All right, we're gonna do this guy.
Remember this guy, the crab?

156
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,200
Okay.

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,800
All right, we're gonna test this eye first.

158
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,199
- Do you prefer this lens or this lens?
- The other one.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,300
- This one?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,500
- You sure?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,200
All right, put your glasses on.
This is for you.

162
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,400
Show your mom. Good boy.

163
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,399
I'm gonna ask you to take the drops
for at least five days.

164
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,500
And maybe,

165
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,100
should I keep wearing the glasses?

166
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,900
Would you like me to
order you to wear them?

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay.

168
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,600
I order you to wear your sunglasses,
unless you're bathing or sleeping.

169
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,999
All right, I'll give you a try tomorrow.
I just wanted to get your take

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,900
on a bizarre case I saw today. Okay.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,700
So, it appeared to be, kind of, what
we call an amaurosis, which is a..

172
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,499
- Which is a kind of a..
- Oh! Oh, sorry.

173
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,699
- Are you done?
- Sorry.

174
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,399
- Sure, do you want to hear this or no?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,500
Except with an amaurosis,
everything goes dark,

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,699
and with him, everything was white.

177
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,799
Well, how do you know what he saw?

178
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Exactly. I don't know what he saw,

179
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,600
but I guess I have to take
his word for it, don't I?

180
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,899
It could be something neurological
like, something we call agnosia

181
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,700
which is an inability to
recognize familiar objects.

182
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
- Agnosia?
- That's right.

183
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,600
It's as if a man sees, I don't know,
a fork, he looks at it, he says,

184
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,699
"What is this thing? I've never seen
anything like this before."

185
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,000
Ta-Da!

186
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,400
Is that related to agnosticism?

187
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
In what way?

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,399
You know, "Agnosia."
"Agnosticism."

189
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,599
- Etymologically speaking?
- Yeah. Didn't you take Latin?

190
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,399
It's actually Greek, dear.

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,399
Well, I bet it has something to do
with ignorance or lack of belief.

192
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,900
- Hmm.
- There's a lot of judgment in that word.

193
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,500
Never mind. Never mind.
You want some more wine?

194
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,700
- No, but are you sure you do?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

196
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,100
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I..

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,699
What was I gonna ask you?
What was I gonna say?

198
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,299
- How are you?
- Something about dinner?

199
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,400
No.

200
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,900
Diseases?

201
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,800
No. That's a nice sweater.

202
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,499
Thanks. I can't help you,
sweetheart, sorry.

203
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,099
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

204
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted.

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,799
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

206
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Could you set the alarm
back for half an hour?

207
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,299
I need to make a couple of calls
in the morning.

208
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,599
Yeah, of course. Good night.

209
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,499
- Good night. Thank you for the tart.
- Mmm-hmm.

210
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,800
- It was tiramisu.
- Yeah, tiramisu.

211
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,900
- Hi.
- Well, well. What's the big secret?

212
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Hmm?

213
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
What are you hiding from?

214
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
Jerks like you.

215
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,400
That'll be $11 even.

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,500
Thank you.

217
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,600
Taxi!

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Hi. Hotel Emiliano, please.

219
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,700
Do you have the time?

220
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,900
Yeah, you still have 20 minutes.

221
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,100
The guy said you might be late.

223
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,899
You're pretty.
Nice to meet you.

224
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,299
I can't take my glasses off.
Is that a problem?

225
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,599
Are you serious?

226
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
- Doctor's orders.
- Really?

227
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
I can call another girl.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
Fuck, yeah.

229
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,900
That was wild.

230
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,011
I mean it.

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Really weird.
I still see everything white.

232
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,100
- Just ring the bell.
- I've been ringing the bell.

233
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Can I help you?

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
Ma'am, this man says
he's your husband.

235
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
He can't see.

236
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't fucking care what he's done.
You can just turn around..

237
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,699
Just open the fucking door!

238
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,899
- Officer, I don't know this man.
- Forget he's a cop, let me in!

239
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
All right.

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Get out! Fucker!

241
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,899
Thanks a lot!

242
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,500
- Nice and easy..
- Thanks!

243
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
Hey! Hey!

244
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,899
Come on, come on. Let's go.
I'll get you some help. Wait here.

245
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,999
I'll get you some help.
Just wait right here.

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
You don't understand. I can't see!

247
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,800
Jesus.

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,100
- Hello? Hello?
- I need security at 18, right away.

249
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,699
- Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,799
We have a disturbance up on 18,

251
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,899
we need somebody up there..

252
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,999
Yeah, I'm up on 18 already.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,099
I'm going to grab your purse.

254
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,500
All right. It's okay. It's okay.

255
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,500
Where's your clothes?
Jesus Christ!

256
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,499
Hey, hey, hey, slow down.
Everything's going to be all right.

257
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,600
Don't push me!

258
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,100
Shut the hell up!

259
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,700
Take your hands off me.
Where's my dress?

260
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
I need to call my parents.

261
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,100
You're up before the alarm.

262
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
Good morning.

263
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,700
Yeah, I doubt it's going to be
all that good.

264
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,900
What's the matter?

265
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,000
I can't see.

266
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,999
What?

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,699
Somehow that patient I saw yesterday
must have infected me.

268
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,900
That's impossible. Let me look. Here.

269
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,100
I don't see anything. Nothing.
Nobody goes blind like that. That's..

270
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,300
Well, there's at least two of us now.

271
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,999
Oh, no! No, go out! Oh, God, no,
you touched! No, it's infectious!

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
- No, no, no!
- I'm telling you, it's infectious!

273
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
He gave it to me! It's contagious!

274
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,399
- It's all right. I'm not gonna get sick.
- Honey, get out!

275
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,699
- I'm not gonna get sick.
- What am I thinking?

276
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Jesus, I spent the night
in bed with you!

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,900
It's all right, it's all right!
We'll take care of it. It's all right.

278
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,899
It's all right. Shh. It's okay.
It's all right.

279
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,000
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

280
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
What time is it?

281
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,500
- It's almost 8:30.
- Okay, let's call the hospital.

282
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,499
With no visible signs of trauma,

283
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,999
no extenuating symptoms, I'm not
about to barricade the streets.

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,199
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

285
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,100
All right, I'll see
you soon. No problem.

286
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
That's a risk I can take.
All right.

287
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
- What seems to be the problem?
- It's a boy, he's blind.

288
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,400
Hey, sport. It's okay, everything is fine.
Don't be nervous.

289
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,100
Somebody, help!

290
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,000
Ministry of Health.
It's a little bit early.

291
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,299
I would suggest that you call
sometime after 9:00.

292
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,600
Yes, 9:00.

293
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,300
Morning, Minister, some
strange calls this morning.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Oh. Thank you.

295
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,599
God! He was here at 6:00, I think.
Or 6:30. Who else was here?

296
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
The waiting room was
crowded, I remember.

297
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,900
- Ma'am.
- Excuse me.

298
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,099
I have all the contact numbers here.
Do you want me to..

299
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,200
Ma'am. I'm gonna have to ask you
to close up shop

300
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,500
and come with us, as
quickly as possible.

301
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,900
May I have those files, please?

302
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,100
They're gonna be
here any minute.

303
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,399
I know. That's why
I want you to relax.

304
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
I'll take care of everything
when they come. I promise.

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,699
Okay, I'll be fine. If I need anything,
I'll have them call you.

306
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,100
- Or I'll call you myself.
- Okay.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,400
They can't keep us apart
for too long, now, can they?

308
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,400
- Are you coming?
- I'm right behind you.

309
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,900
- Don't lock yourself out, now.
- Don't worry. I've got the keys.

310
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,800
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

311
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Please approach the vehicle.

312
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,700
Do you have a cell phone, sir?

313
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,800
- Yes.
- Put it in the bag, please.

314
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,500
What for?

315
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
- Thank you, this way.
- I got it, thank you.

316
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

317
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,300
No, no, step down, ma'am.
I'm asking you to step down.

318
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,600
- No, I'm gonna go..
- My orders are only to take the man.

319
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
This vehicle is for the infected, okay?

320
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,899
Well, then you'll have to take me,

321
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,900
because I've just gone blind.
I've just gone blind.

322
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
Fine, have it your way.

323
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,500
Jesus.

324
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Attention!
Attention! Attention!

325
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,099
The government regrets having been
forced to exercise with all urgency,

326
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,999
what it considers to
be its rightful duty

327
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
to protect the population
by all possible means.

328
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,899
We are in a state of crisis.

329
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
An epidemic of blindness has
broken out, provisionally known as

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,100
the White Sickness. And we are
relying on the public spirit

331
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,399
and cooperation of all citizens
to stem any future contagion.

332
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,499
The decision to temporarily quarantine
all those infected

333
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,600
was not taken without
careful consideration.

334
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,599
Be assured that the isolation
in which you find yourselves

335
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,700
represents, above any
personal considerations,

336
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,900
an act of solidarity with
the rest of the nation.

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You'll never believe
where they've brought us.

338
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,600
Let me guess. This guy's voice
is already driving me crazy.

339
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,100
You're lucky you can't see it.

340
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,400
It's a video? Well, that's scary.

341
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Makes you question what kind
of an idiot would play a video

342
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
in a quarantine for the blind.

343
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Each ward is equipped with a phone
for communication with the outside.

344
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
The phone is for
emergency purposes only.

345
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,500
We've got to get you out of here.

346
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,699
- I'm gonna tell them that you can see.
- No. They'll never believe it.

347
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,899
You'll never get near
enough to tell them.

348
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,600
I want you to go home,
please go home.

349
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,399
Honey, I know you think you have
to say that, but I'm fine!

350
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,399
- It's what I want.
- Really. All right.

351
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,900
- I want it.
- All right.

352
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,700
Anyway, it's too late now.

353
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,100
But we shouldn't tell
anyone that I can see.

354
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,699
You're right.

355
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,200
With that spirit of
cooperation in mind,

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,599
we ask that everyone pay attention
to the following simple instructions.

357
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,300
Are you with me?

358
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Number one.

359
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Each patient shall
choose his own bed.

360
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,300
It's a corridor.

361
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,700
Number two. Each ward shall elect
a captain or a ward representative

362
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,200
for communication with
the outside world.

363
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
Four? Three?

364
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,700
Row two, number three.

365
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,899
Five.

366
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,800
Doctor, how many wards are there?

367
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,300
Yes, sorry.
There's two other wards on this floor

368
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
and then another ward on
the lower floor for people who..

369
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,700
How do you know that?

370
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,500
We explored a little
before you came in.

371
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,999
We chose this ward because
it's closest to the entrance,

372
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,100
- where the food comes in.
- Well, someone's thinking.

373
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,800
That's the asshole who's
responsible for all this.

374
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,599
If I had my fucking eyes, I'd kill him!

375
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,800
- He's responsible for stealing my car.
- What? Are you serious?

376
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Damn, yeah!

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
If I hadn't been decent
and stopped to help you..

378
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,800
You know, I'm gonna
go to another room,

379
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,499
as far away as possible
from this son of a bitch.

380
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,200
Son of a bitch who can
steal from a blind man!

381
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,799
- Honey, they're fighting.
- They're fighting.

382
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,799
Stop it now! Stop that! Stop this!

383
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
- Over here.
- Stop this!

384
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,200
Stop it, you're acting like children!
Stop it, please!

385
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,899
We're obviously all alone here, okay?
We're on our own!

386
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,799
So if you want to
make this place a hell,

387
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,999
you're going about it
in absolutely the right way.

388
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,100
He stole my car!

389
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,599
It doesn't matter!
What are you gonna do with a car?

390
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,999
You can't drive anyway!

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,299
- He stole my sight!
- Okay, stop that now!

392
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,599
Look, Doc, whoever the fuck you are.
We're all equal here, right?

393
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
There's been no proper election.

394
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,800
So, don't start ordering people around
with that tone of voice.

395
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,200
I am not ordering anybody,
I'm simply asking you to..

396
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm simply asking you
to leave this man alone.

397
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,199
- Okay, fine!
- Come on.

398
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,400
Just be aware that I don't respond well
to that voice of authority.

399
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,299
What I do respond to,
in case you're wondering,

400
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,300
is flattery and people sucking up to me.

401
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,700
Everyone, close your eyes, ladies.
I'm gonna take off my clothes now.

402
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,899
And try out this bed here.

403
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,600
Number three.

404
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,700
Are you okay?

405
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
If you need anything in the night,
I'm right here.

406
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,600
I gotta go pee.

407
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,600
Doorway. So try to remember the route.
How many doors.

408
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,099
How many steps.

409
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,700
I counted them when I first got here.
And straight.

410
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Stop that!

411
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,600
- Doorway. Right turn. I think.
- Right turn.

412
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,100
Straight.

413
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Another doorway.

414
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,399
Ow!

415
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,299
- Jesus!
- What happened?

416
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,299
Ow! What are you wearing
for shoes, bitch?

417
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,099
- Where's the wound?
- Here?

418
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,499
- Oh, fuck!
- Okay.

419
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,800
Crazy bitch stuck her heel in me.

420
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,099
I tripped, and watch your mouth.

421
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,799
- I gotta go pee.
- Just hold it a little while.

422
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Everyone, stay put.
We'll be right back.

423
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay, okay.

424
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I really gotta go pee!

425
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Ow! Jesus! A piece
of skin or something.

426
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,699
I found some dish towels but
I don't know if they're clean.

427
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,099
Okay. Keep pressure on it.

428
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,799
It's too dirty, I think.

429
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,399
It's really bleeding!
It's really pouring out.

430
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,299
What are you wearing?
Give me your shirt.

431
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
Quickly.

432
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,900
Thank God we have a real
doctor here. Seriously.

433
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,300
I was only fooling around
what I was saying back there.

434
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,900
- Relax. Relax. Relax now..
- Ow!

435
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,900
- Careful!
- Here, here, let me!

436
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,900
- Careful!
- Let me do it. Let me do it.

437
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,500
Careful with that. It's expensive.
Expensive shirt of mine.

438
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,500
Once, twice, three times.

439
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,300
All right?

440
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
- That's fine.
- That's good.

441
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm afraid it's gonna be infected.

442
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Doesn't surprise me.
The filth from the street on that shoe.

443
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
What time is it?

444
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,700
1:30.

445
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,100
You can't be responsible for everyone.
You need to get some sleep.

446
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Are you afraid to close your eyes?

447
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,600
No. I'm afraid to open them.

448
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,900
Afraid I'll go blind in my sleep.

449
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I'm gonna take a walk.

450
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Opening the gate.
Pull right up to the door.

451
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,200
Closing the gate!

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Locking up!

453
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,499
Only the infected

454
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,100
are permitted within these doors.

455
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Once inside, follow the corridor until
you find the wards. All right, let's go.

456
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
Four, three, two, one.

457
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

458
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

459
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,500
Hello?
Hello, can anyone hear us? Door.

460
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,000
- Door.
- Door?

461
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,000
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

462
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,200
- Honey, wake up.
- Hello? Hello?

463
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,399
- Hello? Hello? Hello?
- New people.

464
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,699
- How many?
- Not many.

465
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,199
Do you have any beds
available in here?

466
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,100
Yeah. We should.
How many of you are there?

467
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,100
- We don't know.
- Okay.

468
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Maybe you could count off,
one by one, and introduce yourselves.

469
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,499
- I'm Number One, I'm a police officer.
- Okay.

470
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,700
I'm Number Two. I'm a taxi driver.

471
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
Number Three.
A pharmacist's assistant.

472
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,000
Four. I'm a hotel maid.

473
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
- Five. Financial advisor.
- Okay.

474
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,400
That's my wife!
That's my wife!

475
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,399
- Honey?
- It's me.

476
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Honey?

477
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,200
- Where are you?
- Here.

478
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,900
Say something.

479
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,600
Keep talking.

480
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,535
That's great!

481
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:17,600
Is my mom here?

482
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,999
She'll be here, don't worry. Okay?

483
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Get off.

484
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
That's them. I wanna catch them.
Quickly.

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
It's occupied. Move on.

486
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,400
Okay, everyone, try getting
yourselves settled in.

487
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,600
We'll be right back.

488
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,999
Who was that guy talking?

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That guy is our ward
representative. All right?

490
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,299
Please!
Go.

491
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
Please! Stop!

492
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

493
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,099
Hey, someone's coming.
Please wait!

494
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,400
Excuse me! Wait!
Halt, turn back!

495
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,399
- Wait? Where is he?
- I'm sorry. You gotta get back.

496
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,999
Excuse me, listen! We have
a man here with an injured leg

497
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
and he needs serious
medical attention.

498
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,700
He has an infection, he needs
antibiotics. I'm a doctor.

499
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,999
I can't let you leave.
So please turn back.

500
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,400
Okay. I'm not asking to leave.

501
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,199
I'm simply trying to ask
for some help here.

502
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,599
Get the fuck back!
Another step and I'm gonna shoot.

503
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,899
This is ridiculous. Now.
I have a sick man here.

504
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,899
- This isn't gonna work.
- All right, listen!

505
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,099
I'm gonna count to three
and if you don't turn back,

506
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm gonna shoot you!

507
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,900
Can you talk to your superior, please?

508
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,500
- One!
- You gotta be kidding me!

509
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,700
- Two!
- This is insanity!

510
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,000
Will you talk to your supervisors?

511
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
This is not going to work!

512
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,800
- Three! I'm gonna fucking shoot you!
- Let's go.

513
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,799
Thank God.

514
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,700
This is ridiculous!

515
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
Just forget it.
They're not..

516
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,300
I can't believe this is happening.

517
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,099
- Three.
- Stop.

518
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,400
Each ward is equipped with a phone
for communication with the outside.

519
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,600
The phone is for
emergency purposes only.

520
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,000
Would you like a drink?
Coffee?

521
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
Is there any
coffee here?

522
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,700
Is there any extra food
at the end there?

523
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
I don't know.
The other table needs one.

524
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,799
I think I have one.
An extra fruit cup.

525
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Does anybody need that?

526
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,400
Anybody has a knife?

527
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,300
Or a fork?

528
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,900
I have a knife.

529
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,399
Do you want to borrow mine?

530
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,999
I'll wait, what about you?

531
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,300
- We can share it.
- No problem.

532
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm still curious about
what happened to that girl, though.

533
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,999
What?

534
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,799
There was this girl in 1806,

535
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,599
screaming, naked, except
for these sunglasses.

536
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,699
Naked?
She'd gone blind?

537
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,400
Yeah. She was the
one that infected me.

538
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,599
- Is it good, your food?
- Yeah.

539
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,900
Yes, I'll leave a message, my message
is why is there an emergency number

540
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,600
if there's no one there to answer it?

541
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,099
We have a situation
here in the blind ward.

542
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,299
Apparently you missed that
because we don't have enough food.

543
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,199
Also, there's still my request
from yesterday

544
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,100
for an emergency medical supply kit.

545
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,000
I hope you get this
message before dinner.

546
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
- Pull it up!
- Six more coming!

547
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,399
Number Five, security guard at a hotel.

548
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,899
Number six, engineer.

549
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm a receptionist
at an ophthalmologist.

550
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,799
I know your voice.

551
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,599
Oh, my God, where are you?

552
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Here. Here.

553
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,900
I'm Seven, I forgot to say Seven.

554
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,600
Are you all right? I've got you, okay.

555
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,800
Left, left, make a left and straight.

556
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Straight. Keep going.

557
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,900
- Do you need a hand?
- No. I got it.

558
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
That's it.

559
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,200
First of all, welcome
to the newcomers.

560
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,200
We're Ward One.

561
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,299
There's a few things I want to discuss.

562
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,800
We have a guide line now that
connects all the wards to each other.

563
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,700
It's an innovation made by my wife.
We can thank her for that.

564
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
There's another point. The toilets.

565
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,100
They're absolutely disgusting.

566
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,900
I'm going to need a team of people
to go and see what's going on in there.

567
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,000
I like the warm feeling on my face

568
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
The smell too.

569
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
You used to like it..

570
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Remember that New Year's
when we went to the shrine?

571
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,400
There were so many
people waiting in line.

572
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,000
It was cold.

573
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,000
The ceremonial fire

574
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,700
was near the line.

575
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,700
When we got close to it

576
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,900
our bodies were warmed on one side..

577
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,200
It felt good.

578
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,199
We didn't even know
each other that well..

579
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
I don't want to listen.

580
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't want to listen.

581
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Why?

582
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
I can't pretend.

583
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,000
There's no..
There's no soap.

584
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,100
I guess it's better than nothing.

585
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
You hear that?

586
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,000
What?

587
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,200
Hello.

588
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,300
Hello.

589
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,500
Would you happen to have an
extra bed in your dorm?

590
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,700
I have a radio.

591
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
There's not as many stations
as there used to be.

592
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,400
But I guess if you insist,
I can give you an update.

593
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
At least we could
save on the batteries.

594
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,600
Please.

595
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,000
In the first 24 hours there
were hundreds of cases,

596
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,800
or so the rumor says.

597
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,600
All the same. No pain.
A sea of white.

598
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,900
The government's response,
as you know, was decisive.

599
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,800
The first of the make-shift quarantines.

600
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,400
But this decommissioned sanitarium
didn't make for ideal public relations.

601
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,599
Let's organize a massive
international medical conference of

602
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,800
ophthalmologists and neurologists.
We don't yet know if this is..

603
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,100
And so, for days and days
the helpless viewing public

604
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,800
was subjected to seminars
and endless roundtables

605
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,600
with specialists from around the world
proclaiming their general ignorance.

606
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,799
That was published in
Infectious Disease International.

607
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,399
How premature it was to talk of cures.

608
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,800
How more research was
needed, and more funding.

609
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,100
A point that was at least once
dramatically illustrated.

610
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm blind! Oh, my God,
I've gone blind! Oh, my God!

611
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,500
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Someone please! Please help me!

612
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
Somebody!

613
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,800
Shit! Shit!

614
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,000
Shit. No, no, no!

615
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,300
Weeks passed, and with time

616
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,200
and the constant coverage,
the city was bored back to work,

617
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,099
oblivious to the evidence
all around them

618
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,200
that the disease was
immune to bureaucracy.

619
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,300
What about the roads and traffic?

620
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,500
Chaos, as usual. But then reports
came of a bus crash with 23 casualties.

621
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,300
That same day, two planes collided.

622
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,900
No one could really say if the disease
was the cause of the accidents.

623
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,899
But people were terrified.

624
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,600
And either the panic spread
the blindness,

625
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,400
or the blindness spread the panic.

626
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,800
Casualties multiplied,
people decided to stay home.

627
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,400
And the traffic problems were solved.

628
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,100
My fellow citizens,
friends, supporters.

629
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,700
Like so many of you,
I have gone blind.

630
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,700
Maybe we need some music after all.

631
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,500
Leave it there.

632
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,999
Ladies and gentlemen,

633
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,600
I need you to follow my voice.

634
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,700
Come towards my voice, and as
you do, please watch your step.

635
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,200
Hold on to the person in front of you.

636
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,599
Do not push.

637
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,300
To the right!

638
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,099
Number twelve.

639
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,200
Anyone attempting to leave the
premises will be forcibly corrected.

640
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,799
- Hello?
- Stay in line!

641
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,300
Excuse me! Sir.

642
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,100
We have permission
to shoot! I repeat.

643
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,400
Can we have some guidance, please?
Sir?

644
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,099
We have orders to shoot.

645
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,300
Stay in line.

646
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Please?

647
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
Stay in line, little man.

648
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,800
Hello? Excuse me, sir? Someone?

649
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,400
- We need some guidance, please.
- Stay in line.

650
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Fuck!

651
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,100
Okay, all right, all right.

652
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,200
Attention.

653
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,500
The shovel you requested
is waiting in the yard.

654
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,900
Choose one person to
come and collect it.

655
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,300
One person!

656
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,800
Where is it?

657
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,700
Straight ahead!
Just come, come this way.

658
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,599
Okay, good. You're fine.

659
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,200
Next one's the ground, that's okay.
Okay, keep coming.

660
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,200
Warmer. Warmer. Keep coming!

661
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,500
Colder. Stop. Okay.

662
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,600
Turn to your right.

663
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:46,400
Good, now keep going forward. Okay.
Warmer. Warmer, colder!

664
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,100
Stop. Now turn right again.

665
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,800
Yeah. That's it, okay, good!
Very good, now keep going forward.

666
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,599
Go forward! Good, warmer,
colder, colder, colder!

667
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,099
Stop, stop, stop!

668
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,200
Colder! Colder!

669
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Whoa! Did you see that?
Sarge!

670
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,100
Did you see that?

671
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,700
The blind adapt quickly.

672
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Hello, Ward Three?

673
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,199
Today, three of the newcomers
were gunned down by the guards.

674
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,000
So, I think that the best solution
would be that

675
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,400
each ward takes one body, takes turns
with the shovel that we have

676
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,900
and they bury their own
share of the bodies.

677
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,400
Fuck you.
What do you mean "our share"?

678
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,099
They're not ours.

679
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,100
Well, yes, but some of them
would have probably come to this ward.

680
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,400
After they were turned away
from yours, like I was.

681
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,200
Our ward is full.

682
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,100
Same here.

683
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay, so then we're all
in the same position, right?

684
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,099
Listen, I don't wanna argue about this.

685
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,700
I just simply wanna have these people
buried, and I think the fair thing to do

686
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,700
is that each ward takes a body,
and then the job is quickly done!

687
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,300
All right?

688
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,200
Good.

689
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,200
Now, there's the matter
of food rationing.

690
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,699
It seems that one of the wards is
taking more than their fair share.

691
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,699
So I'm proposing that we put together
some sort of a committee

692
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,299
with a representative
from each ward and..

693
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,000
Who the fuck are you?

694
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,800
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

695
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,200
Excuse me?

696
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,100
Yeah! Yeah, who do you
think you are, giving all these orders?

697
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,300
I'm the chosen representative
from Ward One,

698
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,100
and I suggest that you people
choose your own representative.

699
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,600
Otherwise, we're gonna be at
each other's throats constantly.

700
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,400
So you wanna talk
to our leader, then?

701
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,599
That's right.

702
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Yeah, yeah. Like in a diplomatic
mission, negotiate? Yeah?

703
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,500
Well, here we have
a monarchy system,

704
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,500
and I hereby declare myself
the King of Ward Three.

705
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,500
- Long live the king!
- Long live the King of Ward Three!

706
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,200
Any objections?

707
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,800
Long live the king!

708
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,999
Get the fuck out of here!

709
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,300
And for my first pronouncement
I declare that

710
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,099
everyone in Ward Three will eat dinner

711
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,300
before we think about
getting or burying any dead.

712
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,800
So, eat, eat, eat. Come on, eat.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

713
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,400
You can't sleep like that. You're filthy.
Give me your clothes.

714
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,200
I'll wash them tomorrow.

715
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,000
Go to sleep.

716
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,400
How are you?

717
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,600
You don't know what it's like.

718
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,300
You gotta see it to believe it.

719
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,299
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

720
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,300
Okay, okay. Just try to get some sleep.
You're so hot.

721
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,100
I know you can see.

722
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,099
No, I can't.
I don't know why you think that.

723
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,800
- Don't lie to me. You trust me?
- Uh-huh.

724
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,200
You trust me, then why don't
you tell me the truth?

725
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,600
You can't trust a thief, right?
I got a secret, too, you know what?

726
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,300
I'm smart. And when I went blind

727
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,699
it made me think better.
I got a lot to contribute!

728
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,900
Okay.

729
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,400
I'm sorry for being such a burden!

730
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,100
I can't take this!

731
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,700
Come here and lie down.
Get some sleep.

732
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,700
What time is it?

733
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,600
What? What?

734
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,300
What's the matter?
Have you lost your sight?

735
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,100
I forgot to wind my watch.

736
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,000
Hey! Hey!

737
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,999
Hey! Look at me!

738
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,200
Did you hear that?

739
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,600
I'm gonna check it out.

740
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,900
Hey, fuckers!

741
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,900
What the fuck song is that? It sucks.

742
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,600
- You suck.
- Whatever.

743
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,700
Fuck!

744
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,700
Did you get him? Blood!
There's blood, man, step back!

745
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,099
It could be infected, step back!

746
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,200
Sarge is gonna
fucking kill me!

747
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,499
Is this the right way to go?

748
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,100
Yeah.

749
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,999
You know, he told me
he knew I could see.

750
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
- Shh!
- He told me that, and I did nothing!

751
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,700
What else could you possibly do?
You did everything you could.

752
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
- I think I have to tell them, and then..
- And then what?

753
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,999
- And maybe..
- Become their slave?

754
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
- ..I could help. I could help.
- It's bad enough as it is.

755
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,400
I can handle it!

756
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,500
No. I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about us! Us!

757
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,300
What?

758
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,699
You dressing me, bathing me,
wiping my ass, for Christ sakes!

759
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,999
It's hard enough to think of you as..

760
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,899
As? As what?

761
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:01,000
As a wife.
Instead of my mother or a nurse!

762
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,200
Well, you'll just have to
get used to it, won't you?

763
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,300
Because I don't have any choice.

764
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,799
Okay, you're right, I'll get used to it.
I guess I just have to get used to it.

765
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,600
Do not tell a soul.

766
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,500
Come on!

767
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,300
Attention! Attention!

768
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,799
The government regrets
having been forced to exercise..

769
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,100
Fuck you!

770
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,100
Hello! Hello. Hello. Hello.

771
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,000
Hey, hey, hey!

772
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,600
Hello. Hello.

773
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,799
Attention! Attention! Attention!

774
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,199
That's the last we're gonna
hear from that asshole.

775
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,300
We are taking over this shit hole now.
I'm the King of Ward Three.

776
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,099
And there's gonna be
a lot of changes around here!

777
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,499
What the fuck is that?

778
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,800
Number one. If you wanna eat,
you'll have to pay for it.

779
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,500
And that's pretty much it, I guess.

780
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Okay, and now for our grand finale,

781
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,300
a little song that comes
from the bottom of my heart.

782
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,999
And it goes something like this.

783
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I just called to say I love you

784
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Yeah, come on.

785
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,099
I just called to say I'm on my..

786
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,500
I'm turning it off.

787
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

788
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,199
Okay. Okay.

789
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,900
I just called to
say how much I care

790
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,700
I just called to say I love you

791
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,700
Hey! Stop it!

792
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,900
Don't push. Stop it.

793
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,300
Shut up! Shut up!

794
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,600
Shut up! Shut up!

795
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,200
Or I'll just keep on shooting straight
till somebody gets hit. Okay?

796
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,799
God, you blind people are stupid.

797
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,300
Screaming and crying like babies.
Makes me ashamed to be one of you.

798
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,599
Listen up!

799
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Ward Three is going to take
charge of the food right now.

800
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,799
- What?
- Like in a store.

801
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,699
And like the real world,
we're gonna guard our store!

802
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,799
So don't even think
of breaking in, okay?

803
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,699
So how do we pay for it?

804
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,500
Excuse me, did I ask
for any questions?

805
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,699
He means explain your rules.
What do you want us to do?

806
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,999
Do you want us to come one at
a time or all together, what?

807
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,399
- What do you want?
- He said shut up!

808
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,899
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll tell you what.

809
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,200
We're gonna pile up the food and we'll
let you know the rules later, okay?

810
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,499
Now go back to your wards and
get your money ready, okay!

811
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,300
You know we don't have any money!

812
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,000
Well, then whatever you got, lady!

813
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,700
Shoot her right now.
One less mouth to feed.

814
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,900
If I had eyes, she'd be
dead already, I tell you.

815
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Now. Jewelry, lady.

816
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,200
For example, watches.

817
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,899
Electronic shit, anything.
Anything you think we might like.

818
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,499
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes.

819
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,200
How much is it for a meal?

820
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,700
Well, man, it's.. I don't know!

821
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,399
You know? Just get your stuff together

822
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,600
and we'll let you know
what you deserve, okay?

823
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,500
Hey! And by the way,
don't hide anything.

824
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,200
All right? Understood?

825
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Go, go! Oh, lady, lady! Lady!
I'll never forget your voice.

826
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
And I won't forget your face.

827
00:56:57,783 --> 00:57:01,651
What the fuck! Fuck.

828
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,700
This is wrong, man.

829
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,300
It's wrong, but what else can we do?

830
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,200
We can stick together, we can
stick together and just tell them no.

831
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,799
We're going to stick together.

832
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,400
I'm not giving my stuff up
because a nigger says I have to.

833
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,399
We don't know what race he is, man.

834
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,000
I can tell, I can tell by
the sound of his voice!

835
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,600
Fuck you.

836
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,899
Who the hell are these people?

837
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,100
This is absolute bullshit!

838
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,799
We don't have to do
whatever the fuck they say!

839
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,199
Just because they
make an announcement!

840
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,899
Forget it! We don't have to back down!
We can stand up to these guys!

841
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,800
You're right!
Absolutely!

842
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,799
We don't have a choice.
We have no choice!

843
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,899
What?

844
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,600
They have a weapon.
They have a gun!

845
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,799
But the point is, they can't shoot us all!

846
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,200
Yeah, exactly!

847
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,299
Yes, but if they kill one of us,
then it's too many!

848
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
I'm going to collect the valuables!

849
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,699
No one has to give
if they don't want to.

850
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,100
But don't expect to be fed at
the expense of the rest of us.

851
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,000
- Here.
- I don't have anything.

852
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,099
Don't worry. I'll be like your mom,
okay? I'll pay for us both.

853
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,600
What if you don't have anything?

854
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,599
It's just jewelry, everybody, what
can we do with it in here, anyway?

855
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,299
Each give according to
what they have and all that.

856
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,400
Thank you.

857
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,900
Well, they better come
through with the food.

858
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,500
This is what, plastic?
So much junk.

859
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,500
You know, I thought I told
someone to just tell them

860
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,800
not to even bother putting the plastic in
because it's just a waste of my time.

861
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,399
I'll tell them.

862
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,199
These have some weight.
These are rings.

863
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,899
That's gold.

864
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,800
Two rings, possibly a diamond.

865
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,500
Yeah? That's good.

866
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,099
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Got something here.

867
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,700
We're fine with these people.

868
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,799
Okay, good. That was close.

869
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,600
- It was actually, but it's okay.
- All right.

870
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,999
- All right, one.
- One.

871
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,399
- Two.
- Two.

872
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,099
- And three.
- Three.

873
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,400
- That's it.
- Three?

874
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,799
We normally get four
when we go by ourselves.

875
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,600
Well, now you get three. You keep
whining, you'll get two! Next!

876
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,100
We're coming!

877
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,300
- Next! All right.
- We're here.

878
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,500
We're from Ward One.

879
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,200
- Ward One.
- Don't handle me!

880
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,700
Okay.

881
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,500
We're not gonna hurt you here.
Want your food?

882
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,200
Watch your manners.
All right, it's here, it's here.

883
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,900
I wonder. Can I touch this?
Is that okay?

884
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,600
Shit. Fell down.

885
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,600
Fuck! Nail polish, nail polish.
Fuck.

886
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,700
We got some good stuff here.

887
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,400
- Yeah?
- Looking pretty good so far.

888
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,100
Yeah? Yeah, we're good.

889
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,300
All right. Take it, take it.

890
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:50,639
You're blind.

891
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,199
Oh, thank you, professor.

892
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,900
You're using a Braille writer.
You're a normal blind person.

893
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,300
- Yeah.
- No, he's not normal.

894
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,099
He was born blind. That makes
him some kind of superhero

895
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,400
in a world like this.
So you better watch out.

896
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,699
You of all people, born blind,

897
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,600
should understand
empathy and human decency.

898
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,299
Shut up! Shut up!

899
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,999
He's blind! That's all.
That doesn't make him good or bad.

900
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,300
That just makes him blind.

901
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,299
And now he's blind with a purpose,

902
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,799
'cause he's looking out for the sick
and the hungry of his own ward.

903
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,999
That's right.

904
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,800
How do you sleep with yourself?

905
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,500
That's all we get, is two boxes?

906
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,600
Yeah, that's it.

907
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,899
But the others got a third box!

908
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,599
How are we supposed to
survive on only two boxes?

909
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,700
That's it! That's it, no more.

910
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
It's immoral! A blind man..

911
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,200
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

912
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,599
- Shut up.
- Okay.

913
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,900
Fuck off with the sermon. Okay?
Okay! Get your food! Get out.

914
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,500
And say thank you for what you got!
Understand?

915
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,400
Understand? Understand?

916
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,999
I understand.

917
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,700
Okay, okay. Now say thank you.

918
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,600
Thank you.

919
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:17,615
Okay.

920
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:21,500
- All right.
- Out. Out!

921
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,999
Don't let them get to you.

922
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,300
No, it's fine, it's fine!
This fucking guy, you know?

923
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,099
He wants more.

924
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,499
How many people are
in Ward One now?

925
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,000
35.

926
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,499
We only have 24 meals, so
everyone is gonna have to share.

927
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,600
What!

928
01:02:42,794 --> 01:02:44,887
I'm sorry, this is all they gave us.

929
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,800
Quit shoving, everybody!
Relax!

930
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,900
Just find a partner!
Find a partner!

931
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,100
Two people to a meal.
Please!

932
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,000
Just don't push, okay?
Just wait in line, okay?

933
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,399
Guys! Guys, stop pushing!

934
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,200
And he put you, our own
doctor, to be our leader.

935
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,599
Perhaps he wants to
get a second opinion.

936
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,900
- You wanna eat something?
- Stop.

937
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,300
You have to eat something.
You have to eat a little something.

938
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,900
Stop it!

939
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,600
Do you have any pepper?

940
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,000
Doctor.

941
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,400
- Are you here?
- Yes, I'm here.

942
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,100
Here.

943
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,100
Here.

944
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,600
I brought you some food.

945
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,699
No. Jesus Christ, no.
This place is a toilet.

946
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,099
It's not your fault.
You did everything you could.

947
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,999
No, no, I didn't. The son of a bitch,
he had his gun right in my throat.

948
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,099
Exactly.

949
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,299
No. I could've reached
and taken it, but..

950
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,900
And then what? And then what?

951
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,299
I don't know.

952
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,799
If you'd have killed him,
it would've been way worse.

953
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,900
You would've started a war for sure.
A real war.

954
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,400
You're right.

955
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,400
Yeah, you're right. I'll pretend like
I thought that one through.

956
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,000
And it's not easy knowing
that you've killed someone.

957
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,400
Like I did.

958
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,200
Oh, God.

959
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,800
Oh, no.

960
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:43,730
- Hello?
- Don't say anything.

961
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,600
It'll be easier for me to understand.

962
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,199
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
I wanted..

963
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,800
Oh, Jesus!

964
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,100
Let's be quiet.
Let's all be quiet.

965
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,000
I can see.

966
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,199
I knew that. At least,
I think I knew.

967
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,500
Shh. It's a secret.

968
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:46,400
So, it's been like a week or so, and
you people have nothing left to offer.

969
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,300
So at Ward Three we came
up with a new plan.

970
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:57,900
Bring us your women.
Women for food.

971
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,500
Have a good day.

972
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,300
What's going on?
We haven't eaten in three days.

973
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,400
We gave you all the food we have.
It's up to you to ration it.

974
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,400
Distribution is your problem.

975
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,700
Asshole!

976
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,400
Forget it! Fuck that!
We're not doing that!

977
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,699
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going!
I'm not gonna go! No!

978
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,899
Bullshit!

979
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,699
No one's asking you to go.

980
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,800
What?

981
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,800
Certainly not the men from this
ward, so you can't blame us.

982
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,200
I think she brings up a good point.

983
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,799
And I think we should ask
if there are any volunteers.

984
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,099
Volunteers?

985
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,599
What are you talking about?

986
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,100
Most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard!

987
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,599
Look, if there are
any volunteers,

988
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,399
I think they should say so now.

989
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,899
I wonder how many volunteers would
we have if he said send us your men?

990
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,299
It's not the same.

991
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,499
- Like, it's obviously not the same.
- Oh, really? And why's that?

992
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,300
'Cause it's just not.

993
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,299
- 'Cause there's no fags here!
- Yeah, well there's no whores, either!

994
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,999
Yeah. That's debatable.

995
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,500
I gave myself to you out of pity,

996
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,300
and now you think I'm
some sort of goddamn whore?

997
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,399
Doctor.

998
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,499
What? Are you asking me
for a deliberation here?

999
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:24,400
I mean, my God! Of course I would
rather that my wife didn't go.

1000
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,800
But what I want really doesn't matter.
It's completely up to her.

1001
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,800
My male pride, of course,
is gonna be hurt.

1002
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,900
But if that even exists in here,
what does it matter anyway?

1003
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,300
We're all starving to death.

1004
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,799
So I just think that people should
do whatever they feel like doing

1005
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,400
according to whatever morality
it is that they have left.

1006
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,400
- There's nobody, forget it!
- Just anybody.

1007
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,200
I'll go.

1008
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,700
No. Oh, my God.

1009
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,900
- No.
- I'll go with her.

1010
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,300
Me, too.

1011
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,900
- All right. I'll go, too.
- I'll go, too.

1012
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:26,200
Well, you do whatever you like,
but my wife is going nowhere.

1013
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Dignity has no price.

1014
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,000
No one knows how
many women are here.

1015
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,400
You can do what you like,
and we'll feed you both.

1016
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,600
And then you can talk
to me about dignity.

1017
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,800
- No, that's not the point. I just want..
- I'm no different than the rest.

1018
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,000
- What?
- I'll do what they do.

1019
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,400
You'll do what I tell you to do!

1020
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,900
Don't order me!

1021
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,100
There's nothing worse.

1022
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,600
No. It's disgusting!

1023
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,700
From now on, you don't eat.

1024
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,300
How long do we wait before
they come and get us?

1025
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,800
Get out of the way!

1026
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,400
- Good evening!
- How many ladies?

1027
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,900
Eight.

1028
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,499
- Nine.
- Nine, only nine?

1029
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,400
Well, you nine will have
to do double duty tonight.

1030
01:11:50,942 --> 01:11:54,469
If any of you is on the
rag, we don't want you.

1031
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,000
We will get you some other time.

1032
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,499
No one's on the rag.

1033
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,700
Well then, get yourselves
all gussied up

1034
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,500
and come over at your leisure.
We'll be waiting.

1035
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,999
And the food will follow,
if we're happy.

1036
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,900
In the meantime, I have brought you
a little bit of bread to tide you over.

1037
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,100
I think I have one more.

1038
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,300
There you go.

1039
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,600
Let's go.

1040
01:12:57,608 --> 01:13:01,044
There's no point in trying to run.
They have guards.

1041
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,799
At least it would be faster.
We'd be dead by now.

1042
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,300
No one's gonna die,
come on.

1043
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,100
They're coming!

1044
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,999
Hey, welcome.

1045
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,100
Girls, okay, don't be afraid!
We're here to love you!

1046
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,799
We're not going to hurt you, all right?
Guys, don't get too excited, all right?

1047
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,299
Everyone's gonna get
their own girl, okay?

1048
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,199
If we don't, well, we share!
That's how we do things here, all right?

1049
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,599
Okay. I want you all in
order from hot to cold, okay.

1050
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,499
The hottest come here and the coldest
go to the back of the line.

1051
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,600
What's wrong with you?

1052
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,399
She's a bit of a dead fish.
Take care of her, yeah.

1053
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,100
Give her some life.

1054
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,700
Oh, man, where have
you been all my life?

1055
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,700
Do I know you?

1056
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,699
Okay. Yeah, take your turn.

1057
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:33,700
Why are you trembling? Why are you
trembling? Why are you trembling?

1058
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,500
No, easy, okay.
You two are coming with me.

1059
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,200
Are you blonde?
Are you blonde?

1060
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,500
Okay. All right.

1061
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,199
All right. Okay, a bit
on the mature side,

1062
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,400
but that's more like it.
You like this?

1063
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,500
That's my gun.

1064
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,300
- You like it?
- No, I don't.

1065
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,600
Lady. Lady.

1066
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,199
Now, that's a surprise, lady.
All right, you're coming with me.

1067
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,800
And if you let go,
I'll bite your nipples off, all right?

1068
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,700
- Come on. Now suck! Come on.
- No.

1069
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,700
I'm not asking, all right?
Come on! Come on!

1070
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,999
- I could bite it off.
- Try it!

1071
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,800
I'll blow your fucking head off!
You and your friend!

1072
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,800
All right? Or I'll tear you to pieces.
Come on!

1073
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,600
All right, lady! Hey! Wait!

1074
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,600
All right! All right, way to go!
Okay, okay.

1075
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:52,690
Okay, let's just take
your time, now. There you go.

1076
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:55,100
It's okay, don't worry.
You're so tense. Please sit down.

1077
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Get the fuck out of here!

1078
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:02,400
Little bit tense, there we go!
May I suck on your nipples?

1079
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,100
No.

1080
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,000
Just a little bit. Here we go.

1081
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:19,473
There we go. That wasn't so bad.
Just a little tickle. Tickle, tickle.

1082
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,199
Come on, dead fish!
Move for me!

1083
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,800
Come on!

1084
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,700
Move now!

1085
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,100
Will someone
go get the food?

1086
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:01,700
What happened? What happened?

1087
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,900
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1088
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,499
You want another story?

1089
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,400
The women of Ward Two.
Tonight is the big night.

1090
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,900
- How many ladies?
- Seven.

1091
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,300
Seven? You sure that's it?
Count them again.

1092
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,099
- Seven!
- All right, well, if you've got seven..

1093
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,300
How about,
"The boy with the magic powers"?

1094
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,999
- You like that one, don't you?
- Yeah.

1095
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,399
Okay, so where did we leave off?
Do you remember?

1096
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,699
- This boy wasn't ordinary.
- No.

1097
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,299
He could turn invisible,
he had special powers.

1098
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,699
And he turned invisible
when they weren't looking.

1099
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,499
- Right.
- 'Cause when they looked,

1100
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,700
he wasn't there
and they thought he got away.

1101
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,600
Good afternoon, ladies.

1102
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,199
I just wanted to make sure that
you've all recovered

1103
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,800
from the fun that
we had the other night.

1104
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:30,923
Seriously, I just wanted to touch base

1105
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,500
with any of you who might be feeling
a little bit of jealousy.

1106
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,600
I know that tonight is not
your night, but I assure you

1107
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,300
that our hearts are still with you.

1108
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,300
You men folk should be
very proud of your ladies.

1109
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,400
Very proud! Well, one of them
was kind of a dead fish,

1110
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,200
but the other ones
performed like real pros.

1111
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,500
There are only eight of us now.

1112
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,900
- What happened, did someone die?
- Yeah.

1113
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,600
It's not a big deal, though.
She was kind of a dead fish.

1114
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,800
I'm gonna finish the story later, okay?

1115
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,699
- Aw..
- No, I promise, I'll finish it later.

1116
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,800
Okay.

1117
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,000
Who's that? Where you going?

1118
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,331
It's you, isn't it?

1119
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:53,367
What happened?

1120
01:21:53,368 --> 01:21:54,200
Hey, hey, hey!

1121
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,300
What the fuck is going on?
Hey!

1122
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,800
I know you're here!

1123
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,300
You don't even know my name.

1124
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,699
No. I know your voice!

1125
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,899
Just say one more word. I dare you!

1126
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,000
Your dead friend said the same thing!

1127
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,231
Don't let them leave!

1128
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,100
Do not let them leave! You idiots!

1129
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,600
Come this way.
Come this way. Go!

1130
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,100
Do not let them leave!

1131
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,300
You fucking jerks, stop them!

1132
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,600
Come back! Get back here!

1133
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,299
That's it! That's it for you!

1134
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,299
Ladies, no more food for you!

1135
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:38,000
Every day we go without food,
one of your men will die!

1136
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,000
We collect from now on.

1137
01:22:46,697 --> 01:22:48,130
You missed!

1138
01:22:52,436 --> 01:22:55,701
He's dead! He's dead!

1139
01:22:57,241 --> 01:23:00,039
What's going on?
Where are you? Where are you?

1140
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,800
- Are you okay?
- Go get the food.

1141
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,100
They told me a man was killed.

1142
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,300
I killed him.

1143
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,299
Now there's gonna be a war.
They're going to want revenge.

1144
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,599
We're gonna have to
barricade our doors.

1145
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,500
- We'll use our beds like they did.
- Whatever you say. I'll get the food.

1146
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,100
Oh, shit.

1147
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,100
- Barricade it! Barricade it!
- You got the door?

1148
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:42,999
Two beds!

1149
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,199
So fucking what if we send
the women there twice a month?

1150
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,299
We'll get fucking fed!

1151
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,699
Stand it up!
Barricade the thing!

1152
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,900
Come on.

1153
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,399
What I suggest we do is we
find out who killed their leader

1154
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,499
and offer them up like a peace offering.

1155
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,700
No, not now!

1156
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,499
We don't know what kind of thing
they're gonna do!

1157
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,600
In exchange for food!
They have a stockpile.

1158
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,999
We're in a state of war.

1159
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,899
And we started it.
Yeah. Exactly.

1160
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,800
And I suggest we find out
who killed their leader and..

1161
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,700
Look! Look.

1162
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,200
If they won't give us food,
I say let's get it ourselves!

1163
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,499
Yeah, let's do it!
I agree.

1164
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,800
Then let's go!
Okay, I think he's right.

1165
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,699
If anyone's willing to go,
I think you should raise your hand.

1166
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,100
What? What?

1167
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,800
That's about the most ridiculous thing
I've ever suggested.

1168
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,677
How about, whoever doesn't wanna
fight, simply slip away right now.

1169
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,700
And no one will know you were here!
And for those of us that are left,

1170
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,400
gather around me,
and we'll make a plan.

1171
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,100
Here.

1172
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,300
Here.

1173
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,000
Okay, how many of us are there?

1174
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,900
One, two, three..

1175
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,600
12. I can see 12 of us.

1176
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,400
What?

1177
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,600
Don't touch my fucking bed!

1178
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,200
Do it! Come on. Do it!

1179
01:26:14,371 --> 01:26:15,429
Hey!

1180
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,500
- I heard something!
- Someone's here!

1181
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,600
Who's there?

1182
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,000
I heard somebody.
Who's there?

1183
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,300
I heard somebody!

1184
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,400
I have a chair over here.

1185
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,299
Let's go, come on!
Grab the person in front of you!

1186
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,300
Stay in a tight group.

1187
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,200
All right.
Straight ahead.

1188
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,799
If we go back!
We can't go back! Come on!

1189
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,000
Let's move!

1190
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,499
What's that?
Smoke.

1191
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,200
Fire!

1192
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,100
Help!

1193
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,800
Don't push!

1194
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,500
Fire!

1195
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:30,539
It's okay!
It's okay! It's okay.

1196
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,000
Stay there! I'm gonna come get you.

1197
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,900
- Here I am. Hold on to him.
- They're gonna shoot us.

1198
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,800
Guards! Guards!

1199
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,600
Do you see?
Do you see what's going on?

1200
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,000
Guards!

1201
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,500
We're free!

1202
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:32,599
Hello! Hello!

1203
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,900
We're here!

1204
01:30:32,596 --> 01:30:33,688
- It's empty.
- Okay.

1205
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,499
Go on in. Step up.

1206
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,600
We're in a shop.

1207
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:36,099
Now everyone, please stay together,
I don't wanna lose anybody else.

1208
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:39,399
Step up.
All right, I'm gonna go look for food.

1209
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,499
I'll go with you.

1210
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,099
No, it's something I can do better
on my own.

1211
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,400
You stay here
and look after each other.

1212
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,099
Right here. It's right here.

1213
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:49,700
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get out. This place is occupied.

1214
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,000
There are other groups out there.

1215
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,200
Do not leave this spot.

1216
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,499
I know you can do it.

1217
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,800
But how can you carry the food back
on your own?

1218
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,200
Is there anything,
is there running water?

1219
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,300
I'll look for bottles.

1220
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,100
I wouldn't guess there's any electricity.

1221
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,400
No.

1222
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,700
Are there any signs
that people can still see?

1223
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,900
What's happening?

1224
01:31:45,068 --> 01:31:46,831
Don't! No!

1225
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,100
I miss you. I miss you so much.

1226
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,899
Here's a supermarket.

1227
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,399
- I'll go in.
- Okay.

1228
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,500
Step up.

1229
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,500
I'll stay here. I know my place.

1230
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,300
Stay off my fucking spot!
Don't touch me!

1231
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,500
I'm coming back!
I'll fucking kill you!

1232
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,500
You stay off my fucking spot!

1233
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,699
That's mine!

1234
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,700
Give it to me, you thief! You thief!
You thief! Give it back!

1235
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,800
Give it to me!

1236
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,299
Hey! Hey!

1237
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,400
I can hear you near
my fucking spot!

1238
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,100
What do you have there?

1239
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,699
Hey! Hey!

1240
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,500
What are you eating?

1241
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,500
Smells like meat!

1242
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,500
She's got meat?

1243
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,400
No! No! No! No!

1244
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,299
Let go! Get back!

1245
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,700
Stop!

1246
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,900
Stop! Stop!

1247
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,500
Let go!

1248
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,500
No! No! No!

1249
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,200
Get away!

1250
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,900
It's me! Go! Go! Go!

1251
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,100
Okay.

1252
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay!

1253
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:12,900
You all right? You okay?

1254
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,599
- Oh!
- Okay.

1255
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,100
- I have to stop. Stairs.
- Stop, stop.

1256
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,499
All right. You're all right.
It's all right. You're safe.

1257
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,400
- Thank you.
- You're okay.

1258
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,099
I have to go back and get those clothes
before I forget where they are.

1259
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,600
Here, eat something.

1260
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,800
That God is punishing
us. This is not what is happening.

1261
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:58,200
This is not God's way.

1262
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,400
What is happening to us

1263
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,300
reminds me of what happened
to Saint Paul.

1264
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,700
Paul used to kill Christians,
used to persecute them.

1265
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,699
But the Lord came to him
and converted him.

1266
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:16,399
And not only converted him,
but blinded him.

1267
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,200
Is this what is happening to us?

1268
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,799
- Here!
- Here.

1269
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,000
- Here I am!
- Here.

1270
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,400
Here! Here, I have a jacket.

1271
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,800
- Where's the food?
- Right here.

1272
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,300
It's terrible. Who would do that?

1273
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,000
Someone who went blind.
And then he went crazy.

1274
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,899
Since he couldn't see,
he didn't want his statue to see.

1275
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,999
I don't think so, little man.

1276
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,299
I don't know if it'd be
possible for a blind man

1277
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:31,000
to paint the painting like that.

1278
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,300
Yes, they could.

1279
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,199
More likely a priest
who saw what happened

1280
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,800
and had a crisis of faith.

1281
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,400
No, but seriously,

1282
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,700
all those people made me think

1283
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,100
of how lucky we are that we have
a leader with vision.

1284
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:48,000
So I think it's up to you to
decide what we should do next.

1285
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:52,900
Well, I think we should
stay here tonight.

1286
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,100
Try to get some sleep.
And then tomorrow,

1287
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,800
I was thinking we
could go to our house.

1288
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,800
It's pretty near here and it's big,
so it can accommodate everybody.

1289
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,099
Where are you, dog?
Still there?

1290
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,600
No, no, no. Don't follow that dog.
He'll lead you to a fire hydrant.

1291
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,600
Too proud to be a seeing-eye dog.

1292
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:47,999
27. Five-four. Black hair. Brown eyes.

1293
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,800
I don't wanna know what you look like.

1294
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,100
Well, how can we know each other?

1295
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,900
I know that part inside
of you with no name.

1296
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,500
And that's who we are, right?

1297
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,599
When you went to look for food,

1298
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,899
we talked to this man

1299
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,400
that was part of a group
that moved around together

1300
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,199
trying to find food and shelter.

1301
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,700
Each night they slept
in a different place.

1302
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,700
I asked him why he didn't
sleep in his own home.

1303
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,699
And he said he didn't know
where it was anymore.

1304
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,800
He lost it.

1305
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,099
They're welcome to it,

1306
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:25,600
if they can find their way
to my little room.

1307
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,300
I think it's okay!
Here we are. Here we are.

1308
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,600
Looks fine. Come in. Come in.
Come in. I can't believe it.

1309
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,800
Okay, careful.

1310
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,200
Just because the door was locked,
doesn't mean that no one's here.

1311
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,900
Hello?
Hello?

1312
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,700
Is anyone here?

1313
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,700
Maybe we should take
our shoes off. Right?

1314
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,899
That's a good idea.
We can leave them by the door.

1315
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,700
We don't wanna mess the place up,

1316
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,200
we just arrived.

1317
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:03,100
If you want, take off your clothes, too.
We have plenty of clean ones upstairs.

1318
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,499
Are you talking to me?

1319
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,699
No, to everyone.

1320
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:08,800
Our clothes are just
as dirty as our shoes.

1321
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,499
Here? All together?

1322
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:14,500
Come on. She's the
only one who can see.

1323
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,499
If it makes you feel better,
it's getting pretty dark.

1324
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,699
All right. If you insist.

1325
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:22,200
I'm sure you've seen worse sights
than this old body.

1326
01:44:27,997 --> 01:44:29,555
I want you to feel at home here

1327
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,300
because this is your home now, too.

1328
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,099
Thank you both.

1329
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,700
We're all flattered that
you would offer your home.

1330
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,800
It's our pleasure.

1331
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,199
Kick us out when you've had enough.

1332
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,299
Or when I become too
much of a burden,

1333
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,800
just tell me, and I'll just
wander off like an elephant.

1334
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,099
You're not an elephant.

1335
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,600
I'm not a man, either.

1336
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,600
You're plenty of a man, babe.

1337
01:44:53,723 --> 01:44:54,699
I don't know.

1338
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:57,500
I haven't seen myself in so long.

1339
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,599
- I must look ridiculous.
- No, no.

1340
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,700
- Dirty and skinny.
- But not ridiculous.

1341
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,700
Not at all.

1342
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:07,399
- And what about me?
- You're beautiful.

1343
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,200
Yeah. Not like you.

1344
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,200
You've never seen me.

1345
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,099
But in my dreams you're
always beautiful.

1346
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:15,199
How come you never
appeared in my dreams

1347
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,499
but I know you're beautiful?

1348
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,800
Well, that's why
blindness is a gift to the ugly.

1349
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,017
Come on, you're not serious.

1350
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,399
No, but I suppose I was
more beautiful before.

1351
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,200
- We were all more beautiful before.
- I know.

1352
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,799
Is anyone cold? It feels so good!

1353
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,800
I'm having a great time.

1354
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,799
- Hello?
- Hey.

1355
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,900
- Hi.
- It's me.

1356
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,200
I brought you some hot water.

1357
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,500
Oh, thank you.

1358
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,700
- I'm gonna pour it down, okay?
- Okay.

1359
01:46:18,107 --> 01:46:20,598
- Feels good?
- Feels good.

1360
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,700
I hope we can find the boy's parents.

1361
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,200
What do you hope for?

1362
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,600
Nothing is more ridiculous than

1363
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,200
the desires of an old man.

1364
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:44,800
Tell me. I wanna know.

1365
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,000
You wouldn't understand.

1366
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,799
- Why that tone of voice?
- What tone?

1367
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,900
That one.

1368
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,200
What I hope is that

1369
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:03,000
we can go on living together.
As we are. Like this.

1370
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,000
Blind?

1371
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,100
For me nothing has been better.

1372
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,400
I'd want us to live together.

1373
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,700
Together with me or with everyone?

1374
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,400
Don't make me say.

1375
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,600
I wanna know.

1376
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,300
Are we alone?

1377
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,500
Is anyone listening?

1378
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,400
Good. Good. I wanna live with you.

1379
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,000
I remember that New Year's.

1380
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,700
It was cold, but I didn't mind.

1381
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:14,000
All right. At this end of the table,
we have peas and carrots.

1382
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:19,300
At the center we have olives in a bowl
and some crackers on a small plate.

1383
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,200
And at the far end of the table
we have anchovies.

1384
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,399
- Mmm..
- Anchovies!

1385
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,299
A special bottle of something
sparkling for our guests.

1386
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,100
There's nothing like water.
Clean water.

1387
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,800
I'd like to propose a toast.

1388
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,100
To our family.

1389
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,100
- To our human family.
- And the dog!

1390
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:41,200
- And the dog!
- And the dog!

1391
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:52,151
Much better than any champagne.

1392
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,300
I see you.

1393
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:13,800
When I touch you like this,
I see your face.

1394
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,700
So beautiful.
It's all I need to remember.

1395
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,200
Tell me, is this working?

1396
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:32,500
Let's see. Take another one.
Take another of me in the face.

1397
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,300
Blind inspiration.

1398
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,600
There's coffee, if anybody wants some.

1399
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,400
- I'll have some, please.
- I want some, too.

1400
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,699
I need to wake up.

1401
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,800
Honey, honey,

1402
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,400
I think we should
get everybody together

1403
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,400
and talk about what we need to do.

1404
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:57,200
There's not much food left,
and I'm worried about security.

1405
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:59,700
Okay.

1406
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,100
I can pour it for you.

1407
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,400
Careful.

1408
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,800
It's hot, okay?

1409
01:50:20,049 --> 01:50:22,609
- I can see you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1410
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,500
I can see you.
Oh, my God!

1411
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,600
I can see everything!

1412
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,600
- What?
- I can see you.

1413
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,899
What are you saying?

1414
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:33,000
- I can see you.
- What?

1415
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,500
- Yeah.
- What?

1416
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,900
- Everything is beautiful.
- What are you talking about?

1417
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,200
- What?
- Oh, my God!

1418
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,599
What do you mean, you can see?

1419
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,700
I can see you. I got back my sight.

1420
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,900
- What is it?
- Come here.

1421
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,700
I can see.

1422
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,000
I can see!

1423
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,200
You're lying.

1424
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,600
Really?

1425
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:58,399
What? You have your sight?

1426
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,099
Yeah, hi!

1427
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:03,699
- You're kidding! Your eyes! Just now?
- Nice to meet you.

1428
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,600
- Oh, my God!
- He can see.

1429
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,200
I can't believe it!

1430
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,700
He sees! He sees!

1431
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,900
I know.

1432
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,900
I thought he was kidding!

1433
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,299
Oh, my God!
What does this mean?

1434
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,000
I can see everybody's face!

1435
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,599
I know.
I can't believe it.

1436
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,400
I can see. I love you guys.
You guys are so beautiful!

1437
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:42,028
- Oh, my God. You're so beautiful.
- It's wonderful.

1438
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:43,000
It's wonderful.

1439
