00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,098
I'm gonna rip your head off!

2
00:01:58,499 --> 00:01:59,863
Donnie...

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,895
...you're not in Vietnam.

4
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,069
Man, you scared the shit out of me.

5
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,565
Yeah, take my board. Yeah.

6
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:13,075
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, baby.

7
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,087
Hey!

8
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,799
Morning.

9
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,732
You're going to schooI today,
right, Tony?

10
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:56,463
Don't worry about it, Dad.
I'm just gonna get wet.

11
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:59,402
I don't want my son
to be a ditchdigger.

12
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,572
I got him, Dad, okay?

13
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:09,277
Don't ever go outside
dressed Iike that again.

14
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,755
One, two, three.

15
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,141
Yeah!

16
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,189
-It's big today.
-They're there, huh?

17
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,093
That's Skip charging.

18
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,329
Shit, dude.

19
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:41,276
It's judgment day, boys.
Let's paddIe.

20
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:42,911
You broads aren't surfing now.

21
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,636
I ain't surfing no sIoppy seconds.

22
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,508
You're working rat patroI, mop top.

23
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,609
Jay, you're on parking-Iot detaiI.
Keep it IocaI.

24
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:56,016
And you, PeraIta, the boneyard.

25
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,984
I don't want our boards
hitting a piIing.

26
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,622
I better not see any dings.

27
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:03,348
If you wanna surf the cove,
you gotta earn it.

28
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:17,495
Look at that right.

29
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,376

30
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,079

Go back to the VaIIey, kooks!

36
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,379

00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,049
-This is private.

00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,289
-Yeah, Tony!
-HeIp me out here.

47
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,263
Fucking anaI pirate fags!

48
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:56,467

49
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,831

You got one in your hair, bro.

56
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,549
Yeah, it's my backup joint.

57
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,654
He's gonna go under.

58
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,652
-Hey, there goes Tony.
-LittIe wetback.

59
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,860
Yeah. That was a good one.

60
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,025
Hey, here comes Jay.

64
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,078
Hey.

65
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,016
Oh, my God.

00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,727
Back to the boneyard for you, paI.

00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:22,761
Come on.

68
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:44,038
-Perfect timing.
-Ahoy.

69
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,106
Yeah, put your
sweeping hat on, man.

70
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:52,673
I'II say it, man. This shop's a shithoIe.

71
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,555
Surf's up, man! Yeah!

72
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:05,253
I'm sorry, man. Is your equiIibrium

73
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,759
Come on. That's not right.
We know he's got bad ears. Come on.

74
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,589
Sid!

75
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,560
That-- That was good.

76
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,792
-Oh, man, I'm sorry, Sid.
-That was a good one.

77
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,298
It's cooI, man.

78
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:24,461
Hey, why do I pay you when I shouId

79
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:28,171
-You don't pay me.
-WeII, now you know why, Sid.

80
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,501
Where are your paIs, man?

81
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,238
Yeah.

82
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:08,829
Hey!

Yeah. Hi.

85
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,042
-Yeah.
-Hi.

86
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,939
This isn't a Iibrary...

87
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:25,808
...so it's 1 0 bucks to browse.
You got 1 0 bucks?

88
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,751
Didn't bring any money today.

89
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:34,681
Yeah, weII, why'd you come into
my store, then, asshoIe?

90
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:36,888
Hey.

91
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,781
Go browse in the VaIIey, kook.

92
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,823
Okay, so, what?
You got cash, or...? What?

93
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:47,052
Man, I got something
better than cash.

94
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,163
These are urethane
skateboard wheeIs.

95
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,231
They're ure-what?

96
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:56,062
Urethane, man. It comes from oiI.

97
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,793
-From oiI?
-Yep.

98
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,995
With these, you can do the same
hard turns you do on your surfboard.

99
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,230
-Yeah?
-Yep.

100
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,805
You can even cIimb waIIs, man,
because they grip.

101
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,033
-They grip?
-They grip?

102
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,834
-They grip.
-Shit.

103
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:15,509
-Sid. Sid, you shouId've seen us.
-Check these out.

104
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,184
They're urethane.
They come from oiI.

105
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,875
And they grip.

106
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,757
Who's got bad karma?

107
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,534
I said, who's got bad karma?

108
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,429
-I got the worst karma, Skip.
-Dude, right here, Skip.

109
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,160
-Oh, no, no.
-Give it to me, me.

110
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,361
-I'm first. Come on.
-It's my board.

111
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,472
Come on, you IittIe pervert.

112
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:02,437
Oh, my God.

113
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:10,946
-Nice.
-Ripping, dude.

114
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:13,782
-Is that aII right or what?
-Insane. Insane.

115
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,684
Red Dog, hit it.

116
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,183
Yeah, surf it Iike a wave, man.

117
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,787
Yeah, Red Dog.

118
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:22,859
-Hey, Kathy.
-Hi, Kath.

119
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,689
Hey, get back here.

120
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,421
Hey, dude, is that your sister?

121
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,993
I grew up, Stacy.

122
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,168
No shit.

123
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,605
-Yeah, Jay.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

124
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,400
-Jay boy.
-Come on, Jay.

125
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:46,133
-Yeah!
-Jay boy!

126
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,408
Oh, my God.

127
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,048
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

128
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,376
PuII my ankIes. No, puII my ankIes.

00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,576
Come on, Stacy.

130
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,413
Yeah, Stace.

131
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,915
I can't heIp it. I Iove Iong hair.

132
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,586
-Come on.
-Later.

133
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,659
That was gnarIy.

134
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:17,024
Go-- Go sIow. Go sIow.
Oh, no. Are you okay?

135
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,699
Yeah.

136
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,658
ShouId my weight
be on my back foot?

137
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,860
WeII, yeah, I mean, that's--
That's how I do it. I mean...

138
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,628
...it might be different, though...

139
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,363
...the whoIe center-of-gravity thing,
you know, for girIs.

140
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,508
-Yeah.
-You know, your back--

00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,144
Tony!

143
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,379
Oh, yeah. Bring it in.

00:13:58,561 --> 00:13:59,959
Yeah. Is that aII right or what?

146
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,023
Yeah.

147
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:04,630
Fingers together, T.A. Chop, chop.

00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:10,635
-Tony.
-ExactIy.

149
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:14,702
Safe.

150
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:20,033
Stacy, you're gonna need more speed
than that if you wanna puII it off, right?

151
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,802
That's right. Listen to the master.

152
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,779
Grab your pad
and take notes, PeraIta.

153
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,511
Yeah, Tony.

154
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:32,343

-Yeah, nice, Jay.

00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:41,554
Hey, BiIIy, man, if we buiIt a decent

157
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,487
I don't make toys, bro. I'm a shaper.

158
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,821
Hey, I-- I think we shouId

159
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,962

Thank you. You IittIe maggot. Scat.

Beat it, Sid.

162
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,831
So, what do you think, man?

163
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:02,664
WeII, there's more concrete in
the worId than good surf breaks.

164
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,999
Yeah, I hear that, man.
There's money in this.

165
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,334
There's onIy beer.

166
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,381
I mean, how many 1 6-year-oId
surfers wear watches, man?

167
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,820
-Incoming!

...he's got a job.

170
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,858
Yeah, my point exactIy.

171
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,459
He's not one of us, man.

172
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:40,124
-You know, he's not a pirate.
-Going to work, PeraIta?

173
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,821
Yeah, get a haircut, man.

174
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,332

00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:15,575
-...and back down on his board.
-Idiot.

342
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:44,538
-Oh, come on.
-...riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

343
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:47,207
You don't know how to judge.

344
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,245
Hey, you bIew me away.

345
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,939
What? You want to bIow me?

346
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:54,312
Maybe.

347
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,317
Next up wiII be Tony AIva,
riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

348
00:29:57,522 --> 00:29:58,954
-Yeah.

349
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:03,849
Yeah.

350
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:07,917
He started out with some
quick S-turns up onto the bank.

351
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:14,630
-Frontside 1 80 power sIide.
-That's it, T.A.

352
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,366
Very nice waIking spinner.

353
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:34,307
Into a 360, maybe a 540.

354
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:38,009
Another Iow-driving turn,
touching his hands to the ground.

355
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:41,745
Yeah.

356
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:46,744
Here he comes toward the judges.
Ends up with a Iow-driving 360.

357
00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:48,320
That was a great run for AIva.

358
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:50,513
Looks Iike we have
two 1 0s and a 9...

359
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,783
-...the highest score of the day.
-Yeah.

360
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:57,258
Up next from Mar Vista, CaIifornia,
an independent skater, Stacy PeraIta.

361
00:30:57,463 --> 00:30:59,225
The dude showed.

362
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,455
-Go, Stacy.
-Yeah, Stace.

363
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,094
Come on, Stacy.

364
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:10,135
-Yeah.
-Where'd that come from, Stace?

365
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:14,637
Up, up, using the whoIe ramp,
hands on the ground.

366
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,907
Yeah.

367
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,605
And there's another one of those
Iow maneuvers...

368
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,508
<i>...out of the pages
of Surfer Magazine.

369
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,150
Looks Iike he's winding up
for some 360s.

370
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:37,982
One, two, three, four, five.

371
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,818
Five 360s. Amazing.
We haven't seen that many aII day.

372
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:44,287
Hey, Stacy!

373
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,689
Back across the fIat
and there's his finish.

374
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:51,423
Two 1 0s and a 9 bring him
into a first-pIace tie with Tony AIva.

375
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,394
Oh, my God.

376
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,499
-You're disquaIified.
-What are you taIking about?

377
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,731
-You touched the course.
-Everyone touched--

378
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,602
Read the ruIes. You're disquaIified.

379
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,970
Hey, man. Hey, man. Look. Look.
The dude tied me.

380
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,940
Can your dirty ass even read?

381
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:14,538
-T.A.
-Yeah, Mad Dog.

382
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,080
-My dirty ass, right?
-Hey, ease up. Ease up, man.

383
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:18,774
-You saw that--
-Yeah, ease up.

384
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:22,148

00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:23,412
-SIack?
-Yeah.

386
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,784
Who do you think you are, coming

387
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:30,949
PuIIing what shit, man? My boys
are kicking your girIs' asses.

388
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,219
Every judge on the paneI
is on your payroII.

389
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,521
What kind of shit is that, huh?

390
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,058
Watch it.

391
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:39,596
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

392
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,199
Step up to the pIate, man.

00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,747
-Oh, come on.
-No concession.

00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,742
-Next up, junior women's freestyIe.

404
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,048
I just wanted Dad to see

-Who gives a shit about Dad?
-Yeah, hey, hey, T.A., man.

00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:29,097
I wish I couId've been there

472
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,093
What time do you get off?

473
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,463
Three more hours.

474
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,098
There's fish sticks
in the freezer, baby.

475
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:45,003
You know, I'm gonna make some cash
and get you out of this pIace.

476
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:03,251
ReIax, SyIvia.

480
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,555
Stop, stop, stop.

00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,452
Right here. Right here.

482
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:50,819
Hey, isn't that the girI from DeI Mar?

483
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:56,226
-Dude, what are we doing here?
-Shut up, dork.

484
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,094
And sit back.

485
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:06,739
Damn it, Jay!

486
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:09,670
You know how much this is
gonna cost me? You're an idiot!

487
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,474
Jesus.

488
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,680
-Down, guys.
-Get down. Get down.

Grab your skates, boys. Let's roII.

00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,486
Dude, are we gonna rob this pIace?

492
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,392
This wave breaks 2 4 hours a day,
every day.

493
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,295
And you know what, bros?
We're gonna be the first to ride it!

494
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:53,038
Dude! That's so genius.

495
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,072
Dude, there's no way.
This is way too gnarIy.

496
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:58,401
Not if you got the baIIs.

497
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,208
Dude.

498
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,524
-Oh, Jay.
-Dude, you did a backfIip.

00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,588
Let's Iose this stupid diving board.

Yeah! You guys see that?
I carved it.

504
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:41,231
Over the Iight.

505
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,770
Oh, my God!

506
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:46,032
-Dude, you were so far over it.
-That was crazy.

507
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:50,138
-Yes!
-Yeah!

508
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:15,191
Are you aII right, man?

509
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:20,421
I can't feeI my feet.

510
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,032
But then again,
I can never feeI my feet.

511
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,173
-Right there! Through there.
-Where?

512
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:39,270
I Iove the drought!

513
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:52,819
There's a pooI right next door!
It's an amoeba!

514
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:05,889
I can carve that. Guaranteed.

515
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:13,094
George! George!

516
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,769
Wait, wait. Right here.
We got an empty one, dudes.

517
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,555
ToweIs, bro.

518
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:56,054
Here you go.

519
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,689
-I thought I said mayonnaise.
-Sorry, Tony.

520
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:01,801
-What is that shampoo?
-What?

521
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:06,098
-Marie!
-CharIie?!

522
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:10,306
Run!

523
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,169
Run!

524
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:19,336
Jump!

525
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,114
Go, go, go!

526
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,715
Hey!

527
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:26,715


528
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,053
Get in!

529
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,685
You little faggot!

530
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:13,451
-Get over here!
-Tony!

531
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:15,756
Goddamn it!

532
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:18,659
-Get in! Go, go, go!
-Punch it! Go, go, go!

533
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:20,364
T.A.! T.A.!

534
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,437
Tony!

535
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:36,210
Come on, get in the car.
He's a dick. Let's go, come on.

536
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:54,995
Front side, back side.
Front side, back side.

537
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:56,757
Over the light.

538
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:08,867
Where you been, huh?

539
00:47:12,348 --> 00:47:16,546
What, did you just forget
about practice or what?

540
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:21,313
l mean, do you think l like sitting
on my ass waiting for you clowns?

541
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,159
What, it's funny?

542
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,988
ls that funny? ls that funny?

543
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:29,457
How's this? ls that funny?

544
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:31,222
Yeah?

545
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,130
Hey! l'm serious, man!

546
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:38,271
You guys need
to keep pushing, man.

547
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:42,198
He took my burger.

548
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:46,568
Should we bring him
to the pool tomorrow?

549
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:49,106
He's gotta run the shop.

550
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:51,473
Dude...

551
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:54,245
...you just got patty-slapped.

552
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,794
All right.

553
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:25,946
God! Come on, give up, man!

554
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,911
The delivery guy's here
with the resin.

555
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,212
He says that you owe him $575
from the last time.

556
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:35,816
We need it, Skip.

557
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:39,592
Find the checkbook, man.

558
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:43,831
For God's sake.

559
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,829
Yeah, thanks for fixing
the door, man.

560
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,008
Sorry, Skipper.

561
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:56,802
-Fucking asshole.
-Here. Here.

562
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,838
Watch this. l'm gonna go off
the platform, onto the floor, do a 360!

563
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,746
That's great, Sid.

564
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:08,251
Three-sixty. Three-sixty!

565
00:49:11,024 --> 00:49:13,618
All right, watch.
This is my latest move.

566
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,487
Thank you.

567
00:49:16,796 --> 00:49:19,788
Sid, man, get off your ass
and get these boxes.

568
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,330
Hey, how many boards are ready?

569
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:25,469
l need to peddle this shit at Huntington
to cover the check, man.

570
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:32,437
Hey, where are you guys
going, man?

571
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:34,873
-Rincon. lt's firing!
-Rincon?

572
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,707
Ocean's your mistress, Skip.
Don't neglect her.

573
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:40,475
Skip, this shop's about
surfing and working when we want.

574
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:42,845
That was the deal, bro.

575
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:48,650
Yeah, well, that deal worked great
until we started getting orders from...

576
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:51,383
...Australia and Brazil, man!

577
00:50:04,073 --> 00:50:07,702
Come in, Stace. My dad doesn't
get home till 6 in the morning.

578
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,844
Why don't you and l
just go for a ride.

579
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:12,012
lt's a party. Come on.

580
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:15,740
-l know, but l've got really great music.
-What's wrong with this music?

581
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,583
Look at the moon, Stace.

582
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,346
-l love it.
-No!

583
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:23,853
Not here.

584
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:33,930
Come here.
Come down here with me.

585
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:35,863
-No. Let's go.
-Come here.

586
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:45,702
-Your brother's right there.
-So what?

587
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,406
No, seriously.

588
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,546
l gotta go.

589
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,416
l just wanted to be with you.

590
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,650
l'll call you tomorrow.

591
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:10,648
<i>Hey, chica.

592
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:14,148
Fucker!

593
00:52:15,194 --> 00:52:16,387
Yeah.

594
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:19,087
-Take off your boxers.
-No.

595
00:52:19,297 --> 00:52:20,662
Yes.

596
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:24,899
What's wrong, Jay boy?
Got no hair on your inchworm yet?

597
00:52:25,102 --> 00:52:27,002
At least it works, Alva.

598
00:52:27,538 --> 00:52:29,095
Now...

599
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,632
...give me kitty.

600
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,505
Maybe.

601
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:39,672
Oh, God.

602
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:00,397
-Oh, fuck. My dad. Go.
-Closet! Closet!

603
00:53:00,602 --> 00:53:02,399
-Go, go.
-Shit.

604
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:09,969
Hey, Dad.

605
00:53:11,979 --> 00:53:14,174
-What's that smell?
-What?

606
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:16,008
''What? What?''
What are you, deaf?

607
00:53:16,216 --> 00:53:18,547
What is that smell? What?

608
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:21,044
lt's-- Oh, cigars.

609
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:23,347
-Our teacher had a baby girl--
-That's bullshit.

610
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:26,889
-We all celebrated, Dad.
-That is bullshit! Where's the cigar?!

611
00:53:28,794 --> 00:53:30,523
See? Look. Cherry cigar. Smell it!

612
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:36,197
Told you!

613
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:39,735
You think l'm stupid, boy?
You're gonna raise your voice to me?!

614
00:53:41,106 --> 00:53:43,699
The next time l find you
smoking that shit...

615
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:46,034
...l'll stuff it down your throat.

616
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,874
And pick up this pigsty!

617
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:52,571
Jesus Christ.

618
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:11,363
lt's not funny, you two.

619
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:17,129
A perfect right-handed kidney.

620
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:19,900
-Hey, what'd your dad say?
-What'd he say?

621
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:22,507
''Sid, are you high?
The pool's for swimming.''

622
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,803
Tell him we'll fill it back up
when we're done.

623
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,140
Yeah. He said if you guys get hurt,
you'll sue him.

624
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,840
-We won't sue him.
-He said your parents will.

625
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:34,183
Dude, our parents
can't even afford lawyers.

626
00:54:34,387 --> 00:54:36,116
Hey, man. Let me talk to your dad.

627
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:40,453
Hey, man. The only Mexicans
my dad talks to push lawn mowers.

628
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:43,960
Hey, guys. lt's Skip. Come on!

629
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,427
-Hey, shotgun, faggots!
-Hey!

630
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:50,491
Seriously, we should drain it when
he goes on his next business trip.

631
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:53,501
Yeah. He'd have you all killed.
Good one, though.

632
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,300
Good idea. But no.

633
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:58,236
Hey! Kiss me, granny!

634
00:54:58,443 --> 00:55:00,968
Love to get me
some of the gray beaver!

635
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:05,108
Come back when your balls drop.

636
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:06,908
Yeah, you're looking good!

637
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:15,184
-Go back. Go back.
-You, too, Mr. Rogers!

638
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:31,200
Let's skate already.

639
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:33,375
Hey, Skip, how you doing?

640
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:37,576
Hey. They've been swarming my shop
for a week talking about you guys.

641
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:39,110
What did you expect? Come on.

642
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:41,043
Next on the demonstration platform...

643
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:43,479
...the Zephyr Team
from Venice, California.

644
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:45,880
We love you, Tony Alva!

645
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,027
T.A.!

646
00:55:58,232 --> 00:55:59,756
Right on, Tony!

647
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,258
lt always made sense...

648
00:56:02,468 --> 00:56:05,266
...that skateboarding would be popular
on the West Coast.

649
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:08,167
This year alone,
l've taken teams to the Midwest....

650
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:11,832
All right, you got 20 bucks?
One brand-new....

651
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:14,211
ls that good, man?

652
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:28,121
Go find your mommy, man.

653
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:30,225
Come back with 1 0 bucks.
Get out of here.

654
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,259
<i>Jay! Jay! Jay!

655
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:34,755
Say ''Pepsi.''

656
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:40,468
Stacy!

657
00:56:43,606 --> 00:56:45,631
You gave me 50 bucks,
you'll get the board...

658
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:47,036
...because he has the money!

659
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,445
-Stacy!
-Stacy!

660
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:55,583
We love you, Stacy!

661
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:58,617
<i>Stacy! Stacy! Stacy!

662
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:02,852
-Yeah, Stace.
-Yeah, Stacy.

663
00:57:05,793 --> 00:57:07,226
Hey!

664
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:13,728
Yeah, Tony!

665
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:15,765
l am Alva!

666
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:21,566
<i>Let's give a big round of applause
for the Z-Boys from Dogtown!

667
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,640
How groovy was that, huh?

668
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,874
Tony, come talk to me.

669
00:57:34,386 --> 00:57:36,217
See you in the parking lot.

670
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:41,318
You know, Tony, you might be
the best skater in the world someday.

671
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:44,689
Fact is, l think you are the best.

672
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,289
What do you want, dude?

673
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:50,161
Tony, l'll match
whatever Skip's paying you.

674
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:52,598
And l'll throw in a car.

675
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:55,232
-What kind of car?
-Hey, Larry.

676
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,929
How about...

677
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,510
...a brand-new Pontiac Firebird,
muscled up with a 455 engine?

678
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,244
l'll believe it when l see it.

679
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:09,350
Man, l'm the biggest skateboard
manufacturer in the country.

680
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,656
So you know where to find me.

681
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:19,853
Nice work out there.

682
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:32,029
Excuse me. Could you get
the front too, please?

683
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:33,968
Sure thing, bro.

685
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:44,808

-Well, you tell me.

686
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:49,449
-Larry said l--
-He told me some shit...

687
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,180
...about how great l was, dude.

688
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:54,485
''You may be the best skater
in the world someday.

689
00:58:54,694 --> 00:58:58,857
Fact is, l think you are the greatest.''

690
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:03,732
-Just throw these in.
-Okay, so just two Doritos.

00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:15,271
-So, what did he say to you, Peralta?
-Yeah.

693
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:18,778
Well, l guess we're all
the best skaters in the world.

Well, it's all working out
for you boys.

You know what l'm thinking, bros?

697
00:59:27,424 --> 00:59:30,188
We're gonna be on summer vacation
for the next 20 years.

698
00:59:30,393 --> 00:59:31,724
Yeah.

699
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,628
Dude, that's nasty, man.

700
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:39,665
-Hey! Hey, man! My car!
-Oh, my God.

701
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,335
-You're too slow!
-Get over here!

702
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:46,166
Kiss my ass, jack!
You little knob-rocking butt clown!

703
00:59:56,317 --> 00:59:59,342
What's happening, boys?
How's the pool?

704
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:02,747
All right, Tony, let me get a shot
of you right here...

705
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:05,550
...holding your board, like, strong.
Above your head, yeah?

706
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,193
Get right underneath him.
Don't lose that shot.

707
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:11,659
Give me the street thing.
That is great.

708
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:14,664
Jay!

709
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:16,391
Just one shot.

710
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:22,003
You're from Dogtown?
What does that mean?

711
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,538
Venice, man. Ghetto by the sea.

712
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,568
lt's dirty. lt's filthy. lt's paradise.

713
01:00:38,656 --> 01:00:41,784
Okay, let's get all the Z-Boys

714
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,606
-Sid's gonna love it.
-Oh, Sid!

715
01:01:01,143 --> 01:01:05,239
Stacy, Jay and Tony, man.
They couldn't buy that publicity.

716
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:11,643
Red Dog, man, check it out.
You're in there. You're a hero, man.

727
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:53,584
They couldn't even make it
in the water.

728
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,589
They couldn't even surf the cove
without me saying so.

729
01:01:56,794 --> 01:01:59,262
Who wants to surf that
toxic-waste dump anyways?

730
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:00,988
What did you say?

731
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,189
Nothing.

732
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:08,436

Would you make
an exception for us?

735
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:16,739
Baby doll, let me just say
l'm willing to negotiate.

-Thanks, Tony.
-You're welcome.

738
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:28,956
-Hey, Mr. Alva.
-What's up?

739
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:33,059
l took what the dentist told me to take,
but l don't feel anything.

740
01:02:33,261 --> 01:02:35,491
That's the point, babe. Come on.

741
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,130
-Show us how it's done.
-The girls love the ass.

You just gotta let it hang.

Dude, l was gonna tell you.

-Tell me l'm a great skater.
-You are a great skater, Sid.

either one, genius.

855
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:20,224
Well, they do now.

856
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,105
-Here's where you been, my little devil.
-You found me somehow.

857
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:34,610
<i>-l don't know.
-Are you cold, papi?

858
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:37,978
l don't know, seriously.

859
01:09:39,987 --> 01:09:41,955
What do you think you're doing?

860
01:09:42,156 --> 01:09:44,248
-Hey, what's up, Chino?
-What's your problem?

861
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:46,948
Jay's the one with the problem.
Shut up.

862
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:50,485
No, l'm just waiting here for my girl.
lt's cool, man.

863
01:09:50,696 --> 01:09:55,065
lt's cool. Oh, it's cool.
l almost forgot, Jay.

864
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:59,029
Everything is cool because you're
a famous skateboarder, huh?

865
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,262
lt's cool.

866
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:03,202
lt's cool.

867
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:06,142
-Oh, my God.
-lt's cool!

868
01:10:07,445 --> 01:10:08,672
Jay!

869
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,678
No! Stop it! Stop!
You're gonna kill him!

870
01:10:12,883 --> 01:10:14,214
You're gonna be next, bitch!

871
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:50,182
Step off, man.

872
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:58,854
Mellow out, man.

873
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,020
Come on!

874
01:11:05,799 --> 01:11:08,632
Who wants a free surfboard?

875
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,934
Yeah, Billy, you want me
to give away the shop, man?

876
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:16,937
Then here's your share
of the profits, man!

877
01:11:17,509 --> 01:11:18,840
l'm out of here!

878
01:11:19,078 --> 01:11:21,012
You don't see this crap
on the North Shore!

879
01:11:21,213 --> 01:11:22,908
Yeah, this one's for your mommy!

880
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:27,381
Zephyr parties are great.

881
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:35,425
Who wants some free surfboards?

882
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,772
-l'm out of here, buddy.
-Come on, man.

883
01:12:04,886 --> 01:12:06,581
Hey, Jay.

884
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:12,158
<i>Look at him, man. All vato'd out.

885
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:14,458
Topper, this is Jay Adams.

886
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:15,720
What's up, Jay?

887
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:17,294
What's up, man?

888
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:20,661
Hey, bro. Tony's gonna
make a lot of money.

889
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:27,130
Why don't you come hang with us.

890
01:12:32,745 --> 01:12:35,077
-Maybe another time.
-Cool.

891
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:39,614
l'll see you around, bro.

892
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:49,087
-Hey, Jay.
-Hey.

893
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:52,353
-What do l owe you for the beer?
-Five bucks.

894
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,721
Yes. Thank you.

895
01:12:57,501 --> 01:12:58,866
Hey.

896
01:12:59,503 --> 01:13:02,165
l'm thinking of moving to Oregon
to raise chickens and goats.

897
01:13:02,373 --> 01:13:04,101
-Then l could grow my own herb.
-Hey.

898
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:08,243
Hey, Mom. Who is that guy?
He looks like a cop.

899
01:13:08,445 --> 01:13:11,141
No, Jay. This is cool.

900
01:13:14,984 --> 01:13:17,281
l want you to meet
a friend of your uncle.

901
01:13:17,486 --> 01:13:21,115
Hey, Jay. Peter Darling,
LaFond and Barnett Advertising.

902
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:23,985
-Should we go talk in the kitchen?
-Sure. Let's go.

903
01:13:24,326 --> 01:13:25,623
Jay...

904
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:29,558
...has anybody told you
you have that California look?

905
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:31,163
No.

906
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:33,157
You do.

907
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:35,962
Excuse me.

908
01:13:37,004 --> 01:13:38,471
Hey, Jay, l was wondering...

909
01:13:38,673 --> 01:13:42,870
...would you mind removing that--
That thing from your head?

910
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,074
Right.

911
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:53,315
Well, Jay, with the current
skate craze, we at the firm...

912
01:13:53,519 --> 01:13:57,216
...feel that you would be the perfect
spokesman for our new client, Slinky.

913
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:01,891
Would you mind singing
for me right now?

914
01:14:04,764 --> 01:14:07,254
Who are you, man? Really.

915
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:09,490
Let me sing the tune for you, okay?

916
01:14:19,476 --> 01:14:21,239
You want me to sing that?

917
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:24,073
We're prepared to offer you...

918
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:26,241
...$ 1 0,000.

919
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,845
For one day's work. One day.

920
01:14:31,053 --> 01:14:35,012
Give it a shot, baby. Give it a shot.

921
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:57,108
Jay...

922
01:14:58,746 --> 01:15:00,475
...you got the part.

923
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,584
l'm not what you're looking for, man.

924
01:15:11,057 --> 01:15:14,151
Hey, man. People have been
telling me about this club, man.

925
01:15:15,195 --> 01:15:16,890
-Hey, what's up, Sneaky?
-What's up?

926
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,358
Joker.

927
01:15:18,565 --> 01:15:20,395
What's up, homey?

928
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,965
You're gonna get it,
you little motherfucker!

929
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:33,040
Come on, you little pussy! Get up!

930
01:15:35,546 --> 01:15:37,275
Get off me! Get off!

931
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,778
l'll fucking kill that motherfucker!

932
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:47,687
Get the fuck up!

933
01:15:51,728 --> 01:15:54,128
-Fucking faggot!
-Go fuck yourself....

934
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,114
Hey, Skip.

935
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:25,924
Stacy. Have a seat, man.
l want to talk to you about something.

936
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:29,522
How you been?

937
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,357
Yeah? You all right?

938
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:43,134
Listen, man, you know it's not
about a team anymore. Yeah?

939
01:16:43,943 --> 01:16:46,104
lt's about you, man.

940
01:16:46,312 --> 01:16:48,643
This is all gonna be about you.

941
01:16:49,848 --> 01:16:51,315
l thought l wasn't a pirate.

942
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,478
Hey, man. l never said that, man.

943
01:16:54,953 --> 01:16:56,784
l mean, did l?

944
01:16:57,756 --> 01:16:59,348
You didn't even want me
on the team.

945
01:16:59,924 --> 01:17:03,291
l was pushing you, man. Come on.

946
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,556
Listen, Skip.

947
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,795
l'm sorry, you know. l mean--

948
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:11,356
l have....

949
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:14,330
l've been talking to Larry--

950
01:17:14,537 --> 01:17:18,940
l have these injection molding cavities
coming in, man. Check it out.

951
01:17:20,543 --> 01:17:24,309
l'm gonna hire night workers
and run this shop like a factory, man.

952
01:17:24,913 --> 01:17:27,211
Just churn them out, one by one.

953
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:30,979
Well, is anyone else involved?

954
01:17:32,921 --> 01:17:34,718
Well, hey, man, l can't be worried...

955
01:17:34,923 --> 01:17:37,982
...about what everyone else
is doing, you know?

956
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:39,819
l mean, l'm focused on
what l'm doing.

957
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:42,257
l'm gonna build hundreds
of skateboards a month...

958
01:17:42,463 --> 01:17:45,227
...all with your name,
''Stacy Peralta.''

959
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:47,924
Right there, next to ''Zephyr.''

960
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:54,073
What do you think, man?

961
01:17:57,544 --> 01:17:58,875
So, what do you say, bro?

962
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:12,552
Okay.

963
01:18:16,594 --> 01:18:18,323
That's all right.

964
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,770
l dig that one.

965
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:30,764
You heard it from the boss's mouth.

966
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:36,036
Racers ready!

967
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,038
Set!

968
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:43,912
Stacy!

969
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,055
Stacy!

970
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,423
Racers ready!

971
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,754
Set!

972
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,425
All right, Tony!

973
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:07,440
-Take two.
-And action.

974
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:11,808
Cut. Cut. l'm only seeing hair here.

975
01:19:18,184 --> 01:19:19,617
Here.

976
01:20:13,402 --> 01:20:15,393
-Stacy.
-Stacy!

977
01:20:17,139 --> 01:20:18,731
Alva.

978
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,914
Hey, can l try that?

979
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,210
Thanks.

980
01:20:34,888 --> 01:20:36,947
That's a little harder than it looks.

981
01:20:39,493 --> 01:20:41,825
-l sucked.
-One more.

982
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:44,890
-Moon boots, you know?
-Yeah.

983
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:23,890
Stacy, thank you
for speaking with us.

984
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:26,765
Good? Let's do one more,
and we'll take a break.

985
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:29,968
Wow, you're famous, Stace.
The God Squad.

986
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:33,437
Kathy, l was the last one
to leave the Zephyr team.

987
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:37,100
Both your brother and Jay
left without even telling Skip.

988
01:21:39,014 --> 01:21:40,481
This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

989
01:21:40,682 --> 01:21:41,774
Hi. Nice to meet you.

990
01:21:41,983 --> 01:21:43,450
You too.

991
01:21:44,653 --> 01:21:47,280
Everyone sees it
their own way, l guess.

992
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:51,322
-Good luck, Stacy.
-Stacy. Let's do it.

993
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:54,460
Skateboarding's been great. Thinking
about buying a new Trans Am.

994
01:21:54,662 --> 01:21:57,153
Black on black,
with some big fat tires on the back.

995
01:21:57,364 --> 01:21:58,922
Give me one second.

996
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:02,933
Hey.

997
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,694
What's going on?

998
01:22:04,904 --> 01:22:08,203
How was Australia?
How was the...? How was the surf?

999
01:22:08,408 --> 01:22:12,400
l couldn't surf. They had me
going all over doing demos and stuff.

1000
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:15,136
You went to Australia
and you didn't surf?

1001
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,841
Yeah, l know.

1002
01:22:17,049 --> 01:22:19,882
Yeah, well, he's a working man now.

1003
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:21,979
So how's your sponsor?

1004
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:25,448
Well, they help me pay
the rent for my mom.

1005
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:27,786
They were supposed to have...

1006
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:30,119
...his signature board ready
three months ago.

1007
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:41,200
Get back.

1008
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:52,170
What's up, boys?

1009
01:22:52,615 --> 01:22:54,640
Where's your lasso,
Wonder Woman?

1010
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:58,517
Remember, class among gruel.

1011
01:22:58,787 --> 01:23:00,277
T.A. T.A.

1012
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:07,894
What's up, Stacy?

1013
01:23:08,496 --> 01:23:11,556
Poor guy's so straight,
he doesn't even cast a shadow.

1014
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,399
You guys even
skate with him anymore?

1015
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:18,867
The dude's competing with the sun
for the center of the universe.

1016
01:23:20,407 --> 01:23:21,772
Stace.

1017
01:23:24,711 --> 01:23:26,337
Man...

1018
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:29,514
...Stacy looks like a stock car.

1019
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:33,475
Jay. What do you say, man?

1020
01:23:33,686 --> 01:23:37,281
Bro. Your board is bionic, bro.

1021
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:42,218
This isn't the board l designed.
This wood is cheap.

1022
01:23:42,427 --> 01:23:43,758
No, no, no. That's solid wood.

1023
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:47,625
Jay, we're trying to make you
a big chunk of change...

1024
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:52,029
...but the boards you want
are a tad bit too expensive to sell.

1025
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,534
How do you know until you sell it?

1026
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,535
Jay. Jay, look,
you don't know business.

1027
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,968
You don't understand. Hey!

1028
01:23:58,175 --> 01:24:00,837
You don't understand. He doesn't
understand business, right?

1029
01:24:01,045 --> 01:24:03,104
You guys aren't living up
to your word.

1030
01:24:04,147 --> 01:24:05,705
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Look.

1031
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:08,509
Cut the agent crap, Sid. All right?

1032
01:24:08,718 --> 01:24:11,118
You're a little rich boy
who can't skate for shit.

1033
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:14,188
You wouldn't even exist
if it weren't for old Jay.

1034
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:16,017
-All right?
-Yeah.

1035

01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:22,088
-Make it happen.

1037
01:24:22,898 --> 01:24:24,991
Hey, bro, look who's here.
Hey, we know you.

1038
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,963
-What's going on?
-Cokehead freaks.

1039
01:24:28,036 --> 01:24:29,525
Right there.

1040
01:24:29,637 --> 01:24:30,569
Ladies and gentlemen...

1041
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:34,173
...welcome to the World Professional
Skateboarding Championships.

1042
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,639

01:24:43,383 --> 01:24:46,284
Marty Grimes attempts
and makes it perfectly.

1046
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:49,046
There goes Shogo, up and over...

1047
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,286
...and he makes it.

1048
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:53,220
We have a real surprise
for you now.

1049
01:24:54,226 --> 01:24:57,957
Tyson the Wonder Dog,
riding for G & S Warptail.

1050
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:03,627
Up the ramp, he's getting vertical.
He's hanging 1 0 down the middle.

1051
01:25:03,836 --> 01:25:08,101
There he goes.
Give him a big round of applause!

1052
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:14,973
Our next event will be the vert ramp.

1053
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,482
There goes ''Jay boy'' Adams,
first practice run.

1054
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:24,017
Tips his hat on the way down.
That was something else.

1055
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:26,018
Let's give him a big hand for that.

1056
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,850
On his practice run, Stacy Peralta.

1057
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,254
Now riding for San Diego's
Gordon & Smith.

1058
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,793
Nice execution on that one.

01:25:36,032 --> 01:25:39,866
This is the scoring run,
ladies and gentlemen. Ty Page.

1060
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:45,165
And the scores are
a 9, 8, 9, 8, 7, 9.

1061
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:47,068
Great scores.

1062
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:51,109
Okay, our next contestant,
Jay ''Jay boy'' Adams.

1063
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,610
This is the one that counts.
Ready, judges?

1064
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,415
Here he goes for his final run.

1065
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:58,414
Dropping in.

1066
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:01,383
And there he goes,
gets some blinding speed.

1067
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:07,527
Oh, my God! lt's some type of aerial
maneuver l've never seen before.

1068
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:13,256
Didn't quite make that one,
but did you see that?

1069
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:15,931
We'll see what the judges
score him on that.

1070
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:34,008
And his scores are 6, 7...

1071
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:37,344
-...8, 7, 8, 8.
-That's some bullshit.

1072
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:44,955
Jay, Jay, look. All you gotta do is
a couple of kick turns next time...

1073
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:48,494
-...and you'll destroy everybody.
-We can all cash in, brother.

1074
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:50,327
All right?

1075
01:26:50,533 --> 01:26:52,125
Come on, bro.

1076
01:26:54,671 --> 01:26:56,138

1079
01:27:18,926 --> 01:27:22,589

Stacy will advance to the final heat.

1086
01:27:43,449 --> 01:27:47,943
Next up, we have Marty Grimes,
Reef Ryan and radical Tony Alva.

1087
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:56,057
Hey, Tony, it looks like
it's gonna be you or me, man.

1088
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:57,626
Tony!

1089
01:27:57,829 --> 01:27:59,421
No, it's not.

1090
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:01,254
lt's me.

1091
01:28:02,065 --> 01:28:06,297

Tony Alva thrashes that wall with
his trademark ''Mad Dog'' attitude!

1093
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:12,565
Come on. He's got this.

1094
01:28:12,776 --> 01:28:16,074
There goes Reef Ryan,
taking his practice run.

1095
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:18,509
Nice backside execution
by Reef Ryan.

1096
01:28:18,748 --> 01:28:21,546
Oh, my God. Reef and Tony collide.

1097
01:28:21,784 --> 01:28:23,183
Come on, you guys.

1098
01:28:23,386 --> 01:28:25,377
You stupid Val!

1099
01:28:28,456 --> 01:28:30,924
-Kick his ass!
-Oh, wait a minute.

1100
01:28:31,459 --> 01:28:34,121
People, get back in your seats.

1101
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:35,823
ls that the best you got?

1102
01:28:36,598 --> 01:28:38,827
-His eye.
-Paramedics?

1103
01:28:39,033 --> 01:28:41,968
Do we have a paramedic?
lt looks like we have a man down.

1104
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,411
<i>This is a Channel 7 News
special report.

1105
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:56,715
<i>Pacific Ocean Park Pier,
infamous local surf spot...

1106
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,440
<i>...burned to the ground last night.

1107
01:28:58,651 --> 01:29:01,814
<i>This is the latest in a series of fires
that have plagued the park...

1108
01:29:02,021 --> 01:29:04,818
<i>...since it was
officially closed in 1 967.

1109
01:29:05,023 --> 01:29:07,116
<i>Pacific Ocean Park,
once described as superior...

1110
01:29:07,326 --> 01:29:11,194

1113
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:21,637
Look who's here.

1114
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:30,775
Bastards didn't send fire trucks
for over six hours or something.

1115
01:29:35,485 --> 01:29:38,079
Yeah, they wanted it gone.

1116
01:29:39,723 --> 01:29:42,213
They wanted it gone.

1117
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:47,358
You know, the pier has been here
for over 40 years.

1118
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,495
Get behind the perimeter, all of you.

1119
01:29:54,702 --> 01:29:57,967
Set it up 500 yards down the beach.

1120
01:30:01,943 --> 01:30:04,571
Bring it back up to the highway.

1121
01:30:06,146 --> 01:30:09,775
You know that's where
l learned to surf? Right there.

1122
01:30:19,091 --> 01:30:22,492
They look at the cove as a shithole.

1123
01:30:25,731 --> 01:30:29,599
l mean, thank God, man,
because in winter this place goes off.

1124
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:34,102
We had it all to ourselves.

1125
01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:38,735
We had it all to ourselves, man.
You're right.

1126
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:49,513

to come here anymore.

1127
01:30:52,389 --> 01:30:53,651

Hey, man.
Your mama, she has to eat, right?

1131
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:14,904
She has to eat.

1132
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:27,033
-Hey, bro.
-What's up, T.A.?

1133
01:32:27,243 --> 01:32:28,505

Hey, man.
We got all the meds you need.

We're going to Maui
and get you on some real waves.

1141
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:52,827
Get in the limo.

1142
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,627

Let's go.

1148
01:33:20,592 --> 01:33:25,153
So are you a good pirate
or a bad pirate?

1149
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:28,189
Ahoy, captain.

1150
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,226

But the doctor says
l'm getting better.

01:34:00,095 --> 01:34:02,961
You'll be back on top
again soon, man.

1155
01:34:03,164 --> 01:34:04,927
You gotta give it time.

1156
01:34:14,442 --> 01:34:16,238
l'm gonna end up a ditchdigger.

1157
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:17,774
Hey.

1158
01:34:18,812 --> 01:34:20,302
Hey, look at me, boy.

1159
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:22,972
You remember you're an Alva.

1160
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,214
You've got a lot of heart...

1161
01:34:27,419 --> 01:34:28,909
...and a lot of balls.

1162
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:36,560
Hey, come on.

1163
01:34:43,535 --> 01:34:44,729

Let's go. Come on.

1165
01:34:57,881 --> 01:35:00,441
What's up, homey?
You looking at me?

1166
01:35:00,651 --> 01:35:02,243
-You looking at me?
-We were leaving.

1167
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:04,044
-Looking at me?
-Just checking things out.

1168
01:35:04,254 --> 01:35:07,222
Nice Rolex you got there, man.
You sure you want that?

1169
01:35:07,423 --> 01:35:09,482
-You sure about that?
-No, man. Hey, man.

1170

-Jay.
-Hey. How you doing, man?

1172
01:35:14,764 --> 01:35:17,357
-What's up, dude?
-How's it going?

1173
01:35:18,934 --> 01:35:20,231
Man, nice ride.

1174
01:35:22,871 --> 01:35:24,930
Where you been, Jay?

1175
01:35:25,507 --> 01:35:28,704
l mean, l didn't even see you
at the Arizona contest.

1176
01:35:29,077 --> 01:35:31,636
Well, l don't really
skate malls for money, bro.

1177
01:35:31,845 --> 01:35:33,676
Hey, Kathy, come here.

1178
01:35:35,349 --> 01:35:37,613
-Nice car, man.
-Hey, Stacy.

1179
01:35:37,818 --> 01:35:39,285
Hey, Stacy. How you doing?

1180
01:35:39,486 --> 01:35:41,010
Hey.

1181
01:35:41,422 --> 01:35:43,082
Jay tell you about Sid?

1182
01:35:43,356 --> 01:35:44,482
He's sick, man.

1183
01:35:44,757 --> 01:35:46,452
What do you mean?
He's always been sick.

1184
01:35:46,693 --> 01:35:48,490
No, he's real sick.

1185
01:35:48,795 --> 01:35:51,161
That whole equilibrium thing
turned out to be a tumor.

1186
01:35:51,364 --> 01:35:52,695
Brain cancer.

1187
01:35:54,866 --> 01:35:56,959
What? Are you serious?

1188
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,535
Yeah, it's bad.
They operated already.

1189
01:35:59,738 --> 01:36:01,831
He's gonna be back home
this weekend.

1190
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,873
Yeah, we're all gonna go hang out.
You should come.

1191
01:36:05,344 --> 01:36:06,935
Wrong.

1192
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:09,744
We ain't gonna
go see him like that.

1193
01:36:13,417 --> 01:36:15,442
Yeah, l can't go.

1194
01:36:15,653 --> 01:36:17,553

Come on, Jay. You gonna

1197
01:36:25,962 --> 01:36:27,429
So...

01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,791
All right, Jay.

1200
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:48,976

1201
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:51,879
-Hey, how you doing? Come on in.
-Hey, how's it going, man?

1202
01:36:52,086 --> 01:36:54,281
Do you know when my board's

1203
01:36:54,489 --> 01:36:58,447
l know my guy started on it already.
Let me go check it out.

1204
01:37:01,662 --> 01:37:04,597
Hey, Skip? We got an ETA
on that 6'7'' twin fin?

1205
01:37:04,798 --> 01:37:07,426
Yeah, tell the kid he'll be surfing
by Saturday, boss.

1206
01:37:07,634 --> 01:37:10,363
Beautiful. Okay. Thank you.

1207
01:37:11,537 --> 01:37:13,971
How about Saturday?
At 1 0:30 it'll be ready.

1208
01:37:14,173 --> 01:37:16,937
Now, we've got
a wet-suit sale going on.

1209
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:22,134
Dude.

1210
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,566
You look like shit.

01:38:25,572 --> 01:38:27,733
Let me see that thing.

1212
01:38:30,944 --> 01:38:32,605

1213
01:38:35,248 --> 01:38:36,908
Dang.

1214
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:40,108
lt's pretty punk rock, bro.

1215
01:38:45,724 --> 01:38:48,887
l don't have to lift a finger anymore.

1216
01:38:50,461 --> 01:38:54,261
l don't have to take out the trash.

1217
01:38:54,465 --> 01:38:56,933
l don't even have to
brush my own teeth.

1218
01:38:57,135 --> 01:38:58,830
Am l King Tut or what?

1219
01:39:07,077 --> 01:39:09,875
Yeah, my doctor prescribes it now.

1220
01:39:10,413 --> 01:39:11,607
Heard you were sick too.

1221
01:39:12,315 --> 01:39:13,975
Hell, yeah.

1222
01:39:16,085 --> 01:39:18,918
So did you get ahold of T.A.?

1223
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:22,056
He and Stacy are off
making their millions.

1224
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:24,225
Sorry, dude.

1225
01:39:24,527 --> 01:39:26,154
No big deal.

1226
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:30,396
Hey, if you do croak...

1227
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,990
...will you give your house
to my mom?

1228
01:39:33,935 --> 01:39:36,267
Only if she lets me see her tits first.

1229
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:48,777
lt's awfully nice of you to bequeath
your star-athlete-like presence...

1230
01:39:48,982 --> 01:39:50,381
...among us lower life forms.

1231
01:39:51,684 --> 01:39:52,844
Sid, man.

1232
01:39:54,287 --> 01:39:58,121
So, what happened to Florida?
The Kona Bowl.

1233
01:39:58,324 --> 01:40:01,157
Yeah, l guess l missed my flight.

1234
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:06,426
Won't Larry crucify you for that?

1235
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,291
l'm leaving G & S.

1236
01:40:11,503 --> 01:40:13,630
l'm gonna start my own company.

1237
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,468
l've already got a logo.

1238
01:40:16,674 --> 01:40:18,699
Oh, you got a logo?

1239
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:23,441
Man, screw the team.
l mean, you got a logo.

1240
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:29,978
-Sid, l'll just come back later, man.
-No, wait. Stace.

1241
01:40:30,186 --> 01:40:33,622
You have to come check something
out in the back, by the pool.

1242
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:35,452
You too, asshole.

1243
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:47,430
Dudes, look in the deep end.

1244
01:40:47,636 --> 01:40:51,128
There's a Mexican in my pool,
and he ain't pushing a lawn mower.

1245
01:40:57,578 --> 01:41:00,172
Don't make me come up there
and kick your ass, Sid.

1246
01:41:09,756 --> 01:41:11,587
Peralta.

1247
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:14,316
You finally got your
shadow back, huh?

1248
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:17,694
What's up, chrome-dome?

1249
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:20,729
What's the zipper for?

1250
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:23,492
Easy access.
He doesn't have to inhale anymore.

1251
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,897
He just unzips and pours.

1252
01:41:28,674 --> 01:41:31,904
What are you girls waiting for?
My dad said we can trash it.

1253
01:42:52,985 --> 01:42:54,213
Oh, my God.

1254
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:09,290
Guys, let's get him in here.

1255
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,399
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,638
No.

1257
01:43:17,841 --> 01:43:19,638
Okay. Wait, wait.

1258
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,410
l think this'll be
the first pool session...

1259
01:43:22,612 --> 01:43:25,671
...where we don't have to worry
about getting busted.

1260
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:27,371
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1261
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:28,777
Okay.

1262
01:43:28,984 --> 01:43:31,544
-Hey, guys. Let's get him in the drain.
-Jesus--

1263
01:43:33,389 --> 01:43:35,050
All right.

1264
01:43:37,592 --> 01:43:39,355
Lock in, bud.

1265
01:43:52,472 --> 01:43:53,632
Sid.

1266
01:43:58,578 --> 01:44:00,603
Look, Squid.

1267
01:44:01,347 --> 01:44:04,248
l'll let you bang my mom.

1268
01:44:17,362 --> 01:44:19,421
You little punk.

1269
01:44:22,534 --> 01:44:23,728
-Sid, you okay?
-Yeah.

1270
01:44:23,935 --> 01:44:26,198
Hey, Sid. Do you wanna carve?

1271
01:44:30,474 --> 01:44:31,907
l'm first.

1272
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:37,213
We got you, bro.

1273
01:44:37,414 --> 01:44:40,143
-Squiddles, we got you.
-Man down!

1274
01:44:42,452 --> 01:44:44,317
Oh, yeah. You did a kick turn, Sid.

1275
01:44:45,755 --> 01:44:46,744
Sid.

1276
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,384
What are you doing?

1277
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:50,315
Don't be idiots!

1278
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:52,322
-Sorry.
-Yeah. Sorry.

1279
01:44:52,527 --> 01:44:53,721
l'm fine.

1280
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:55,787
Sorry, señorita.

1281
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:57,589
Here. Put me over here.

1282
01:44:57,999 --> 01:45:00,627
Can you bring me some herb?

1283
01:45:01,503 --> 01:45:03,402
-Oh, my-- You all right?
-Yeah.
