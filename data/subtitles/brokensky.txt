<i>There will come a time when No.
know what to call what unites us.</i>



<i>Your name will be fading gradually
Our memory.</i>



<i>And soon, it will disappear altogether.</i>



<i>Margaritta Duras
"Hiroshima Mon Amour."</i>



<i>I remember you</i>



<i>by Morning...</i>



<i>... From you.</i>



<i>In the afternoon...</i>



<i>and by night...</i>



<i>... Always you.</i>



Aristophanes said that true love
were among the only similar.



And he uses to explain the mythology.
At first there were men



and women
and a species called "androgens.



These androgens were two men in one,
or two women or a man...



... And a woman. At one point found themselves
very strong and decided to defy the gods.



But do not count on
austúcia to Zeus, who ordered Apollo to...



undo these "wounds". Apollo decides to share them
the chest and belly and just leaves a hole



which is the navel, as a souvenir
Dessen recklessness.



Thus, Aristophanes said that man
will always get that



half of which was divided
in the beginning, and when...



... You then find that other half,
true love and true happiness.



<i>Jonas!</i>



Come on!



Can you imagine?



I do not know...



I'm afraid



<i>They have the opportunity to live a
unfailing love</i>



<i>and will perhaps die
a day for him.</i>



- Oi
- A beer



<i>Jonas can not stop crying...</i>



<i>It is a long time to look
spot where he disappeared...</i>



<i>And cry...</i>



<i>Want to see it again
Why cry...</i>



<i>Do not know, but is certain
that he was who had always hoped.</i>



<i>The saw by chance
and now wants to see him again, whatever the cost.</i>



<i>Gerardo, do not understand.
Not understand.</i>



<i>Remains alien
to this story.</i>

<i>Their bodies are in the same place
Enclosed within themselves.</i>



<i>Sleep always comes first to Jonas.</i>



<i>Sleep well at night because it leads
forgetfulness of life that leads to Gerardo...</i>



<i>... And who wants to leave.</i>



<i>It was after those awakening
Gerardo died when Jonas</i>



<i>He lost his eyes, his voice...</i>



<i>Her eyes closed against his mouth,
soon his lips against his...</i>



<i>His hands too...
but, above all, his eyes closed.</i>



<i>Others say that people are
hiding to penetrate to</i>



<i>TOGETHER and they enjoy
Not knowing is not love yourself.</i>



<i>... Almost without seeing.</i>



<i>These tears hurt the body of Gerardo
as heavenly sword,</i>



<i>cross your heart without stopping
no trace, nothing.</i>



<i>only one certainty,</i>



<i>A scar that burns
as an open wounds:</i>



<i>Had ceased to exist
in the life of Jonah.</i>



<i>There already exist ever.</i>



<i>Gerard turned to Sergio</i>



<i>She looked at him with attention so intense
and deeper, not the saw.</i>

came upon his spirit.</i>

how to love him.</i>



<i>Had started
happening.</i>



Comes



No, really, I can not.



Come!

<i>Until then enter Jonas
Dessen existence of another sense</i>



<i>It took a long time
until he came to his conscience</i>



<i>Suddenly everything changes
around you.</i>



<i>And Jonas wonders
Why?</i>

what Gerardo was living with him.</i>



<i>Can not support it or understand it</i>



<i>Now only thing left to chance
to live with the memory of a Kiss,</i>



<i>of a word,</i>



<i>a hug</i>



<i>a single glance
for an entire love.</i>



Changes that face



You will see that
Nothing happened.



I said I do not know.



Really?

<i>Sergio embraced
against his chest.</i>



<i>And told him I loved him
but nothing in the world.</i>



<i>Gerardo turned
for him</i>

moment, not wanting</i>

his memory.</i>



<i>His voice trembled.</i>



<i>Gerardo then recalled
voice and felt sorry.</i>



<i>Then we did not know
what to say.</i>



<i>And then Jonas told him</i>



<i>I was sorry.</i>



<i>they still loved him.</i>



<i>I could never
stop loving him.</i>



<i>that would love to death</i>



<i>Jonas then listen to the cry
Gerardo by phone.</i>



<i>And wept.</i>



<i>Gerardo stayed in bed</i>

<i>Here is the result of all this
time I mean</i>



<i>I loved you,

<i>That is all.</i>
