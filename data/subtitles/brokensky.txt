00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:16,926
<i>I remember you</i>

7
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,167
<i>by Morning...</i>

8
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,084
<i>... From you.</i>

9
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,325
<i>In the afternoon...</i>

10
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,368
<i>and by night...</i>

11
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,069
<i>... Always you.</i>

12
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:27,249
Aristophanes said that true love
were among the only similar.

13
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:31,422
And he uses to explain the mythology.
At first there were men

14
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:36,317
and women
and a species called "androgens.

15
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:40,443
These androgens were two men in one,
or two women or a man...

16
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:47,597
... And a woman. At one point found themselves
very strong and decided to defy the gods.

17
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:53,606
But do not count on
austúcia to Zeus, who ordered Apollo to...

18
00:08:53,607 --> 00:09:00,089
undo these "wounds". Apollo decides to share them
the chest and belly and just leaves a hole

19
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,492
which is the navel, as a souvenir
Dessen recklessness.

20
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:10,749
Thus, Aristophanes said that man
will always get that

21
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,207
half of which was divided
in the beginning, and when...

22
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:21,585
... You then find that other half,
true love and true happiness.

23
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,010
<i>Jonas!</i>

24
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,556
Come on!

25
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,447
Can you imagine?

26
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,327
I do not know...

27
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,175
I'm afraid

28
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,284
<i>They have the opportunity to live a
unfailing love</i>

29
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,935
<i>and will perhaps die
a day for him.</i>

30
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,852
- Oi
- A beer

31
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,494
<i>Jonas can not stop crying...</i>

32
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:38,166
<i>It is a long time to look
spot where he disappeared...</i>

33
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,466
<i>And cry...</i>

34
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,872
<i>Want to see it again
Why cry...</i>

35
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,624
<i>Do not know, but is certain
that he was who had always hoped.</i>

36
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:51,111
<i>The saw by chance
and now wants to see him again, whatever the cost.</i>

37
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:54,700
<i>Gerardo, do not understand.
Not understand.</i>

38
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,986
<i>Remains alien
to this story.</i>

Enclosed within themselves.</i>

<i>Sleep always comes first to Jonas.</i>

00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,971
<i>Sleep well at night because it leads
forgetfulness of life that leads to Gerardo...</i>

<i>It was after those awakening
Gerardo died when Jonas</i>

46
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,489
<i>He lost his eyes, his voice...</i>

47
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:06,587
<i>Her eyes closed against his mouth,
soon his lips against his...</i>

48
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:11,092
<i>His hands too...
but, above all, his eyes closed.</i>

49
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,196
<i>Others say that people are
hiding to penetrate to</i>

50
01:11:12,197 --> 01:11:14,750
<i>TOGETHER and they enjoy
Not knowing is not love yourself.</i>

51
01:11:16,017 --> 01:11:16,948
<i>... Almost without seeing.</i>

52
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:25,191
<i>These tears hurt the body of Gerardo
as heavenly sword,</i>

<i>only one certainty,</i>

55
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:32,905
<i>A scar that burns
as an open wounds:</i>

56
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:36,405
<i>Had ceased to exist
in the life of Jonah.</i>

57
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:39,252
<i>There already exist ever.</i>

58
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:26,465
<i>Gerard turned to Sergio</i>

59
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:31,323
<i>She looked at him with attention so intense
and deeper, not the saw.</i>

60
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,261
<i>Soon the idea of its existence
came upon his spirit.</i>

61
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:37,618
<i>She looked at him
how to love him.</i>

62
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,298
<i>Had started
happening.</i>

63
01:37:28,021 --> 01:37:28,790
Comes

64
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,062
No, really, I can not.

65
01:37:31,063 --> 01:37:32,184
Come!

66
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,526
Have loved you long ago.

67
01:47:14,343 --> 01:47:17,975
<i>Until then enter Jonas
Dessen existence of another sense</i>

68
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:21,373
<i>It took a long time
until he came to his conscience</i>

69
01:47:22,315 --> 01:47:24,395
<i>Suddenly everything changes
around you.</i>

70
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:26,231
<i>And Jonas wonders
Why?</i>

71
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:30,026
<i>Can not imagine another love
what Gerardo was living with him.</i>

72
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:33,260
<i>Can not support it or understand it</i>

73
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:15,264
<i>Now only thing left to chance
to live with the memory of a Kiss,</i>

74
02:04:16,052 --> 02:04:17,000
<i>of a word,</i>

75
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,939
<i>a hug</i>

76
02:04:19,983 --> 02:04:22,685
<i>a single glance
for an entire love.</i>

77
02:07:39,770 --> 02:07:41,221
Changes that face

78
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:44,599
You will see that
Nothing happened.

79
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:49,051
I said I do not know.

80
02:08:27,025 --> 02:08:28,414
Really?

81
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:30,320
Sure.

82
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,089
For this bullshit!

83
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:18,062
Sergio!

84
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,480
<i>Sergio embraced
against his chest.</i>

85
02:10:37,245 --> 02:10:39,176
<i>And told him I loved him
but nothing in the world.</i>

86
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,717
<i>Gerardo turned
for him</i>

87
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,121
<i>And the first saw.</i>

88
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:47,250
<i>He said he believed him.</i>

89
02:10:47,251 --> 02:10:48,251
<i>Me too!</i>

90
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:57,755
<i>Long after Jonah
called him.</i>

91
02:11:58,549 --> 02:11:59,564
<i>"I am",
I told him.</i>

92
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,170
<i>Gerardo recognized his voice.</i>

93
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:07,900
<i>Jonas said:</i>

94
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:10,114
<i>"Just wanted to hear his voice"</i>

95
02:12:10,115 --> 02:12:11,637
<i>I am.</i>

96
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:14,708
<i>Were silent</i>

97
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,751
<i>Jonas said that every day, somewhere
moment, not wanting</i>

98
02:12:20,752 --> 02:12:22,950
<i>His image returned
his memory.</i>

99
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,025
<i>His voice trembled.</i>

100
02:12:28,453 --> 02:12:30,451
<i>Gerardo then recalled
voice and felt sorry.</i>

101
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:34,824
<i>Then we did not know
what to say.</i>

102
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,093
<i>And then Jonas told him</i>

103
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,251
<i>I was sorry.</i>

104
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:44,530
<i>they still loved him.</i>

105
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:47,008
<i>I could never
stop loving him.</i>

106
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:48,850
<i>that would love to death</i>

107
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:57,485
<i>Jonas then listen to the cry
Gerardo by phone.</i>

108
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:00,856
<i>And wept.</i>

109
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:06,007
<i>Gerardo stayed in bed</i>

110
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,330
<i>continued crying</i>

111
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:14,203
<i>Recalling him as the
oblivion of love itself.</i>

112
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:17,204
<i>... As the terror of forgetting.</i>

113
02:14:19,070 --> 02:14:22,070
<i>Here is the result of all this
time I mean</i>

114
02:14:22,071 --> 02:14:24,200
<i>I loved you,
scream it.</i>

115
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:25,200
<i>That is all.</i>
