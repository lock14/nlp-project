1
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,441
Honey, you haven't told me
one name that you liked yet.

2
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,451
Are we positive
it's a girl?

3
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,180
You can't tell anything
by the sonagram.

4
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,756
Yes, Paulie,
it's a girl.

5
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,518
If you would have came with
me to the doctor's today...

6
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,560
you would have seen her kicking
and moving on the monitor.

7
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,721
She was even
sucking her thumb.

8
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,628
Hey, what's the matter?

9
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,394
Nothing, just I'm late...

10
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,060
And cousin Mike is gonna
be here any minute.

11
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,035
So I just...

12
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,265
I know that look
on your face.

13
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,102
What's bothering you?

14
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,302
I do not have any
look on my face.

15
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:51,900
Yes, you do.

16
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,248
I'm nervous, too.

17
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,408
Okay, but we got to
talk about this...

18
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,509
or it's gonna get
real weird, real quick.

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,554
I know, I know, I'm just...

20
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,622
with the wedding
and everything...

21
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,190
I guess I'm just
distracted.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,157
Have fun with your friends.

23
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,661
We'll be waitin'.

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:29,809
Yo.

25
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,517
Three days away, cuz.

26
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,019
You lucky bastard.

27
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,588
Lucky?

28
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,348
Yeah, lucky!

29
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,015
Beautiful girl,
baby on the way...

30
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,922
I'd say that's lucky, man.

31
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,051
That's real lucky.

32
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,569
You ran away and
left me, long time ago

33
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,377
Why are you playing
that song again?

34
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,543
It's a good song.

35
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,087
It's for someone that
left a long time ago.

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,213
Did you tell him yet?

37
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:10,789
No.

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,289
Tell me what?

39
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,757
Guess where Jimbo
is right now.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,225
Eatin' a san dwich?
ookin' for a job?

41
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,922
Picking Tc up from
the train station.

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,931
What the fuck happened?
Tc's coming in?

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,364
Why the fuck is
Tc coming here?

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,297
Nobody likes Tc!

45
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,267
And... he's a groomsman.

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,428
Oh!

47
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,505
You don't make a guy
like that a groomsman!

48
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,265
He's a zero!

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,671
Plus you haven't seen the
guy for like 8 years, Paulie!

50
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,040
Do I see you every
day, anymore? No.

51
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,407
Are you still one
of my best friends.

52
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,310
Are you groomsman? Yes.

53
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,440
Am I cousin? Am I
a normal person...

54
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,178
that doesn't fuckin'
steal shit from you? Yeah!

55
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,719
No, forget about it, man!

56
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,345
ook, Mike, it's
in a few days...

57
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,425
all you gotta do is just
be cordial to him, okay?

58
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,618
You can't do that?

59
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,921
I can't do that.

60
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:49,494
Why not?

61
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,620
'cause I don't know
what cordial means.

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,355
Speak English, Paulie!

63
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,590
Fuckin' cordial...
what is that?

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,132
It means "be polite,"
you retard.

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,633
Just be polite to the kid.

66
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,565
Why didn't you say polite?

67
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,500
Mr. Shanty-lrish-Newspaper
Man, He's got to...

68
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,732
Be nice to him.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,137
He'll be here in an hour.

70
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,072
I'll be cordial.

71
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,643
When he comes in,
I'll be real cordial.

72
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,426
Yo!

73
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,429
Thanks for showing up.

74
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,193
I thought I was supposed to pick
you up at the train station.

75
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,632
Yeah, about two
hours ago, man.

76
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,169
I gave up on you.
I'm walkin'.

77
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,102
I thought they
said six or eight.

78
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,468
What eight?
And you pick eight?

79
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,407
Shut the fuck up
and get in. come on.

80
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,738
You clown.

81
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,937
Pop the trunk, man.

82
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,013
You look good, man.

83
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,809
Yeah, you look good too, dog.

84
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,384
Shit, it's good
to see you, buddy.

85
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,250
Yeah, good to
see you too, man.

86
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,220
I take you by your
Dad's place or what?

87
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,791
No, not necessary.
Actually, I was hoping...

88
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,860
to crash with you and
Jules, what do you think?

89
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,189
Can I?

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,320
Shit, fine by me.

91
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,000
You good?

92
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,139
Hey!

93
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,008
I don't give a shit, if you can't
get over your differences...

94
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,081
and play in the band, I'll
just get a new drummer.

95
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,012
You can't get
another drummer...

96
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,014
it wouldn't be
the same band!

97
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,345
And you're not going
to use the old name...

98
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,714
if you got a new band.
No way!

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,650
Why are you
causing trouble?

100
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,119
It's your cousin's wedding...

101
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,019
And you're acting like
a little school girl.

102
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,388
I said I would be cordial
to the cocksucker, didn't I?

103
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,017
Didn't I say I would be
cordial to the cocksucker!

104
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,959
But I will not play in a
rock and roll band with him.

105
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,554
That's where I
draw the line, Dez.

106
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,360
Hey, Paulie, mind if I get
another drummer?

107
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,162
cousin Mike doesn't want
to play in the band.

108
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,635
Dez, we haven't played
together since High School.

109
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,205
Maybe it's not
such a good idea.

110
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,571
It's not a good idea.
It's a great fucking idea!

111
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,940
This is my wedding
present to you.

112
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,444
ook, you need to
rock one more time...

113
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,071
before you walk
down the aisle.

114
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,376
Man, are you hearing me?

115
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,615
I'm hearing ya, Dez.

116
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,279
We will rock, dude.

117
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,015
come on now.

118
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,828
It's good that
you're back, man.

119
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,399
It's too long you
neglected your friends.

120
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,334
I just couldn't believe
when Paulie tracks me down...

121
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,132
and tells me he's
getting married, man.

122
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,264
Yeah, Paulie of all
people, you know.

123
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,843
If you ask me, it's 'cause
he got her pregnant.

124
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,139
No shit.
Well, good for him.

125
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,873
Biggest mistake of his
life, he marries that bitch.

126
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,744
- Yo!
- Hey!

127
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,187
Hey, look who's here!

128
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,659
What is goin' on, fellas!

129
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,823
- How you doin'?
- Good!

130
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,988
Good!

131
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:39,962
How you doin', man?

132
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,698
Dig the goatee, man.
That's cool.

133
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,670
Hey, have shrunk?
Everybody's taller than me.

134
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,234
I heard the good
news from...

135
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,575
Yeah, baby on the way.

136
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,544
The wedding, too.

137
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,444
Obviously.

138
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,211
- Dillon's got that puffed rice...
- et's ahh...

139
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,615
see what's up
with cousin Mike.

140
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,316
Oh, yeah.

141
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,721
come on.

142
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,952
All right.

143
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,719
Now what kind of
friend would I be...

144
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,817
if I didn't try to
patch things up

145
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,396
between two old friends?

146
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,863
Hey, Mike, Tc's here, wants
to say something to you.

147
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,335
ook, first off I
just want to say...

148
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,926
I want to apologize
for what I did.

149
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,629
You owe me more than an
apology, you fuckin' prick.

150
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,502
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
cousin Mike.

151
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,972
You said you were
gonna be cool, right?

152
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:23,973
Fuck this guy,
I'm bein g cool.

153
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,668
I'm being cordial.
Whatever you want to say.

154
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,507
But this guy fuckin'
disappears for eight years...

155
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,602
The guy fuckin'
steals from me...

156
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,204
An apology's
going to do it?

157
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,783
I should kick your
fuckin' ass on prin ciple.

158
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,374
Mike, you ain't
kickin' nobody's ass.

159
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,475
Mikey, it was just a card.

160
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,781
come on, man,
you're being ridiculous.

161
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,412
Why don't we just
get a fuckin' drink?

162
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,923
Look, Mike, you said you were
gonna accept his apology.

163
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,459
Just accept his
apology, all right?

164
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,755
It's a little crazy
to get worked up

165
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,955
over a fuckin' baseball card.

166
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,622
It's just a fuckin'
baseball card.

167
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,165
It's not just a
baseball card...

168
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,131
it's a Seaver Rookie,

169
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,566
I bought it with my
own fuckin' money...

170
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,194
when I was a child.

171
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,205
I was a fuckin' child
when I bought that card!

172
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,140
It's worth hundreds, maybe
thousands of fuckin' dollars.

173
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,175
and-and the meaning
it had to me...

174
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,266
the sentimental value!

175
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,345
I remember in the
second grade...

176
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,538
I don't know what
to say to you, man.

177
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,773
I just don't know what
to say, all right?

178
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,144
I didn't know it was
worth that much to you.

179
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,114
Okay? What more
to you want?

180
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,083
Well why did you
fuckin' steal it?

181
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,346
Mike, Mike, you're
being ridiculous.

182
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,184
Either accept my apology
or not, that's it, all right?

183
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,397
All right.

184
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,394
I accept your apology.

185
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,973
God damn, you
make me work, man.

186
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,210
What's wrong with you?

187
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,213
I got a let it off my chest.

188
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,181
Eight years is a long time.

189
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,513
I'm trying to
apologize to you, man.

190
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,178
- come on.
- I apologize to you.

191
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,659
You're a fuckin' animal!

192
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,886
What the Hell, Mike!

193
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,862
All right, fuck it!

194
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:53,693
Fuck it!

195
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,356
Go ahead!

196
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:54,865
Go ahead.

197
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,434
That's what you
want Mikey... fight!

198
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,198
- Kick his ass, Tc!
- What do you mean?

199
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,203
Fuck him up, TC!

200
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,797
Go for the mouth.

201
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,807
All right, fuck
it, all right...

202
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,310
I don't give a
shit. Fuck it!

203
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,607
Yoou wanna be a man?
Fuck it, come on.

204
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,204
I'm not afraid of
your ass. come on.

205
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,613
I forgive ya'. Fuck it.

206
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,119
You fuckin' believe this guy?
He was gonna hit me.

207
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,383
You should fuckin'
hit him anyway.

208
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:18,957
You forgive me?

209
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,116
You got problems.

210
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,750
You had it comin'.

211
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,123
You got problems
with rage.

212
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,787
Startin' that much trouble
your first day back.

213
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,593
Dez, what do you say you
get Tc a beer right away.

214
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,564
I'm on it.

215
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,068
It's good to see some
things don't change, huh?

216
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,637
Welcome home
brother, come on.

217
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,069
Shoot a little pool.

218
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,617
I don't understand
the New York Jets...

219
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,019
They always play
in Giants Stadium.

220
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,715
All right, here
we go boys.

221
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,723
Why don't they have
their own stadium?

222
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,054
My bar, listen up.

223
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,621
We finish the
bottle, we go home.

224
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,427
Hey, shut it!

225
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,195
Tc comin' home.

226
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,735
And the band gettin'
back together.

227
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,565
And Paulie,

228
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,195
Paulie!

229
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,980
Drink up, cuz.

230
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,742
Bad luck.

231
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:23,888
Is there more?

232
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,048
There you go.

233
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,159
Where's my car?

234
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,260
Jimbo, Jimbo, you're
not driving anywhere.

235
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,964
You don't need a car now,
you got a ride already!

236
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:41,869
Look at that!

237
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,102
Seriously, I'll drive!

238
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,405
You're not
driving anywhere!

239
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,104
Are you fuckin'
kidding me?

240
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,272
Come on, we'll walk.

241
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,576
It's just a couple of
blocks. No big deal.

242
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,843
I'm not walking
with you anywhere.

243
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,612
Whatever, Seaver.
Whatever.

244
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,617
I thought you made up.

245
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,618
Didn't you make up?

246
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,688
You made up right?

247
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,450
You made up.

248
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,650
Hey, that's my trash!

249
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,092
Hey, come on, put it back.

250
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,791
That's my trash, dude.

251
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,128
What's your problem?

252
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,759
The Olympic
sport of beer.

253
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,205
Hey, hey.

254
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,434
Maybe we got to
settle down, Jimbo.

255
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,101
ettin g derelicts
drink after hours!

256
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,872
They should shut
you down, Dez!

257
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,873
Fuck you, bitch.

258
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,181
Dez, Dez, Dez, seriously,
what are we going to do...

259
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,219
for the rehearsal dinner?

260
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,449
One song.

261
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,321
All right, I think if
we get that tight...

262
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,959
Why don't you wanna go
fishing? lt'll be fun.

263
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,503
You're not comin', Tc?

264
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,003
There's a fine line
between fishing...

265
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,801
and standing in the boat
looking like an idiot, all right?

266
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,842
come on, don't leave me
hangin', man, I feel like shit.

267
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,936
Jimmy, he just wants to
spend time with you.

268
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,572
It's the least you
could do as his brother.

269
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,378
Be nice to him, okay?

270
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,480
And remember, don't say
anything about Sue.

271
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,421
You promised.

272
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,117
come on, baby, have a
little faith in me, all right?

273
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,903
You know I purposely
didn't go fishin'...

274
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,869
'cause I know you
need to talk.

275
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,373
So talk.
What's going on?

276
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,502
come on, you've got some
sense of what's going on.

277
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,704
I'm tellin' you,
he's go this edge.

278
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,371
This ridiculous edge.

279
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,040
How long has he
been in this funk?

280
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,085
- It's been this way about a year.
- A year?

281
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,915
Did he tell you he got
fired again last week?

282
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,851
What do you mean, again?

283
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,686
Second job in ten months.

284
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,622
You knew him years ago...

285
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,387
was he the type of
guy that gets fired?

286
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,018
All right, look.

287
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,255
Just try being direct,
and saying

288
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,331
"Jimbo, what the fuck
is going on?"

289
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,524
come on, I've
tried everything.

290
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,861
I've tried couples
counseling...

291
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,299
I've tired his father.

292
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,734
Nothing... he won't
talk to anyone.

293
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,271
And he's getting fat, too.

294
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,499
Oh, yeah.
That I noticed.

295
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,668
He thinks it's funny that
he's let himself go.

296
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,372
He says now that he's
married, why bother.

297
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,277
That's what happens
when you get to 35.

298
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,576
You think you got
your head together...

299
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,583
and then all of sudden
your body falls apart.

300
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,585
Yeah, well his head
is hardly together.

301
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,928
I got to hand
it to you, bro'.

302
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,864
You figured it out, man.

303
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,733
You got a nice
house, great boat...

304
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,669
all the time to enjoy it.

305
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,139
Hey, look, I only fish
before or after work.

306
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,733
Today is an exception
because I wanted...

307
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,972
to spend time with
my big brother.

308
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,878
Wait a minute, you call
what you do, work?

309
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,042
Shit, if I had to type for a
couple of hours every day...

310
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,643
yeah, I'd have plenty
of energy to fish.

311
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,188
Wait, you're going
to try and tell me...

312
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,588
the reason you just go home
and watch TV every night...

313
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,058
is because you're too tired
from sellin' office supplies?

314
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,619
I'm not a salesman,
I'm the general manager.

315
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,823
Okay? There's
big difference.

316
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,560
I've got 1 5 people
underneath me.

317
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,191
Yeah, Jimbo.

318
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,600
I've seen that pack of
misfits that work under you.

319
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,433
Jesus christ, come
on, Paulie, seriously.

320
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,370
Do not compare what
you do for a living...

321
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,668
with what I do for a living,
'cause there's no comparison.

322
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,107
I do a man's work, okay,

323
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,611
I have to oversee
multiple locations.

324
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,647
I've got shipping,
inventory.

325
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,340
I've got trucks.

326
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,283
So when I get home,
I'm tired, all right?

327
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,910
I'm not doing what you do.

328
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,386
What do you do? You sit in
front of the computer...

329
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,979
for a half an hour, an hour.

330
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,150
So you have the free time
to jog and lift weights...

331
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,625
and fish and do
all that fun shit...

332
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,696
that you seem to
have all day to do.

333
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,424
All right, I see
what you're saying.

334
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,363
So you think the reason...

335
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,901
that you packed on a
couple of pounds lately...

336
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,598
is because you don't have the
time to work out anymore.

337
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,038
What other reason
would there be?

338
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,599
Maybe it's the twelve pack
of Budweiser a night...

339
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,269
I don't know.

340
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,074
Jesus christ, I
work a long day.

341
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,150
I don't have time to exercise,
but I enjoy a few cocktails.

342
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,412
Okay? If you knew
what I went through...

343
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,079
the pressures I was
under, the deadlines...

344
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,148
you wouldn't begrudge
me a fuckin' drink.

345
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,284
All right? I didn't
get lucky, man.

346
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,021
I did not marry
a rich girl.

347
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,728
Fuckin' I'll han d it to
you, you got lucky.

348
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,338
I didn't want to get into
it with you, Paulie.

349
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,410
I'm worried about
you, that's all.

350
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,001
What the Hell are
you worried about?

351
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,377
Getting married.

352
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,143
We've been livin g together
for a couple of years.

353
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,911
You know? I think it's
gonna be all right.

354
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,419
It's different when you
get married, trust me.

355
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,115
I just don't want to see
you making a mistake.

356
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,692
We got a baby comin'
in a couple of months.

357
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,261
It's a little too late to
worry about that, all right?

358
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,920
Hey look, I know, I know.

359
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,328
You don't have to get
married to someone...

360
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,831
just because you
got them pregnant.

361
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,696
It's not the '50s.

362
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,961
No one's puttin' a
gun to your head.

363
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,196
I'm marrying her,
because I love her.

364
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,272
Is that so hard
to believe?

365
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,464
No, of course, I
know you love her.

366
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,267
And you're a good guy.

367
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,773
You're the kind of guy who
has always done the right thing.

368
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,140
It's just not necessarily
the right thing...

369
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:46,973
to get married to someone

370
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,274
just because you got
them pregnant, that's all.

371
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,316
I just don't want to see you
making some huge mistake.

372
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,585
Hey, Dez!

373
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,391
Rehearsal, one hour!
In my garage!

374
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,656
That is the commitment
I like to see, cuz.

375
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,144
Yo!

376
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,979
Do you see me
unloading the minivan?

377
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,246
Dad, we're
going to Murph's.

378
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,343
We're gonna be late.

379
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,581
You're going to be more late
if you don't get your butt...

380
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,850
off the bike and help
me unload the minivan.

381
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,426
We have to be there in
five minutes, Dad.

382
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,121
Yoou got to be there in
five minutes, huh?

383
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,825
et me ask you a
real quick question.

384
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,528
Who likes the
delicious Fruit Loops?

385
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,570
Oh, you do?

386
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,697
How about the little
"fudgie-fudgie"?

387
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,503
You like these?

388
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,737
I guess if you're too busy to help
your dad unload the minivan...

389
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,371
you're too busy
to eat crap food.

390
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,245
Okay, okay!
We'll help you!

391
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,079
You're gonna help?
What a good idea!

392
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,088
Hey, there's
more out there.

393
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,890
Whoa, where's the fire?

394
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,394
So the band is
back together?

395
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,159
Yeah, rehearsal later on.

396
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,995
I can't believe they
actually agreed to it.

397
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,033
Why wouldn't
they agree to it?

398
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,262
Why wouldn't they
want to rock?

399
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,632
Because, sweetie,
maybe the band...

400
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,501
didn't mean as much
to them as it did to you.

401
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,631
What you drivin' at?

402
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,368
All I'm saying is, those
were your glory days...

403
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,170
were they not?

404
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,006
They were not
my glory days.

405
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,773
I've had plenty of
good days since then.

406
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,975
It was what, 1 7 years ago.

407
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,644
Oh, they were good
days, weren't they?

408
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,118
Yeah, baby, they
were pretty great.

409
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,161
We had broken up for
good, just an hour before

410
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,768
Now I'm staring at the bodies
as they dance across the floor

411
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,978
They don't ride
like that anymore

412
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,814
They just don't ride
it like that anymore

413
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,960
We've been livin g together
for a million years

414
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,625
come on.

415
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,531
Now it feels so strange
out in the atmospheres

416
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

417
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:26,800
You're way off.

418
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,701
You guys got way off.

419
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,568
That sucked.

420
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,766
Dude, we were...

421
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:35,973
Honestly, we were...
We started to rock.

422
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,276
Anyway, besides, Tc's
voice sounds like dog shit.

423
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,441
Bite me, man.

424
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,542
That's a great song, dude.

425
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,314
It's a stupid song, you
don't play a break-up song

426
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,754
for a guy's fiancé!
It's a dumb idea!

427
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,483
Where's Paulie, man?

428
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,786
I thought he was going
to come to rehearsal.

429
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,552
He's being a pussy.

430
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,457
ike mister hurt
feelin gs an d shit.

431
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,494
Hey, why don't we
play Jane's Addiction,

432
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,621
"Been caught stealin"'?

433
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,993
I bet Tc knows that one.

434
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,829
Shut the fuck up, dumb ass!

435
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,232
Why don't we do
"American Idiot"?

436
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,463
You can be yourself!

437
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,473
Stop, just stop!

438
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,166
All right?

439
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,573
Knock this shit off.

440
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:10,046
You know what we should
play? We should play...

441
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,983
We should play,
Eddie Money, "Shakin'."

442
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,680
That used to rock.

443
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,188
I ain't playin' shit 'til
you put a fuckin' shirt on.

444
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,054
This is old school.

445
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,149
You look retarded.

446
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,456
It's like Sid Vicious, man!

447
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,498
You're jokin', I
know it, come on.

448
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,588
It's on!

449
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,792
Let's go!

450
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,981
Rosanna's daddy had
a car she loved to drive

451
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:58,119
Stole the keys one night
and took me for a ride

452
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,064
Turned up the music just
as loud as it could go

453
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,534
Blew out the speakers
in her daddy's radio

454
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:09,300
She was shakin'

455
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:13,811
Snappin' her fingers

456
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,315
She was moving
round and round

457
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,786
That girl was shakin'

458
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,257
We started drinkin',
weren't thinkin' too straight

459
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,386
She was doin' 80 and she
slammed on the brakes

460
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,398
Got so high we had
to pull to the side

461
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,231
We did some shakin' 'til
the middle of the night

462
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,569
She was shakin'

463
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,701
Snappin' her fingers

464
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,839
She was moving
round and round

465
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,975
That girl was shakin'

466
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,150
Are you crazy?

467
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,248
Yoou look beautiful...
for a big, fat, pregnant girl.

468
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,886
Babe, is cousin
Mike bringing Jen...

469
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,556
or can I give that
seat to my niece?

470
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,429
I think you can
probably give it away.

471
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,131
Hello?

472
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,709
Dezzi-Dez.

473
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,903
Yeah... oh, would
you let Tina know...

474
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,106
I'm coming over later
for the high chair.

475
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,843
Okay, thank you.

476
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,579
Here you go, you too.

477
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,622
Desmond, yeah,
hold on a second...

478
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,020
I'll take it outside.

479
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,820
Excuse me.

480
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,156
Private matters?

481
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,126
Hey Dez...

482
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,461
What's up, man? Look, I'm
sorry I couldn't make it today.

483
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,831
Everyone else was there,
rockin' out Strong Island style.

484
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,130
Yeah, look, I know...

485
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,763
I had to help out Sue out with
some things here at the house.

486
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,932
Don't tell me you're
gettin' chicken shit on me.

487
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,566
I need you in this band.

488
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,644
No, no, not at all.

489
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,439
Look, I, um...

490
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,514
I got to ask your
advice about something.

491
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:01,416
I'm thinking about maybe not
making Jimbo the best man.

492
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,081
That's a big mistake, Paulie.
It's your brother.

493
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,589
That's the kind of thing
brothers don't recover from.

494
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:11,254
Yeah, well, he told me that
marrying Sue was a mistake.

495
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,352
ook, Paulie...

496
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,092
Your brother's always been
sort of a schmuck, right?

497
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,894
If he's such a schmuck...

498
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,662
why should I have him
be the best man, right?

499
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,793
'Cause he's your brother.

500
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,462
Not a good enough reason.

501
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,061
Is there any way

502
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,834
you're blowing this
thing out of proportion?

503
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,068
I remember how nervous I
was before I got married.

504
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,168
I was 21 years old, right?

505
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,874
Hey! Did I invite you
into this conversation?

506
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,311
Hold on a sec'.

507
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,940
Did I invite you? No!

508
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,781
Do your homework!

509
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:40,051
Sorry about that.

510
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,558
Look, think long and hard.

511
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,892
About this whole thing
before you make that call.

512
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,021
All right?

513
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,224
See you tomorrow.

514
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,432
Pop! What're you gettin' at?

515
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,301
All I'm sayin' is I
appreciate all your help.

516
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,341
ivin g here at
the house with me...

517
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,340
it's nice to
have your company...

518
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,570
watchin' the Met
games and all, but...

519
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,703
don't you think it's time?

520
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,077
Time for what?

521
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,013
You're a grown man,
still livin' at home.

522
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,551
It's not healthy.

523
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,778
I got to take care of you.

524
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,047
But I don't need you
to take care of me.

525
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,417
Yes you do, Pop.

526
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,582
You should start thinkin' about
startin' your own family, Son.

527
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,683
Takin' care of them.
Don't you want a family?

528
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,125
Of course I do.

529
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,321
So what are you waitin' for?

530
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,159
Don't you know any nice girls
who want to get married?

531
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,493
Nice ones, no.

532
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,431
Maybe you'll meet one at
your cousin's wedding.

533
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,093
Weddin's are
good for that.

534
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,602
I don't know.
No one like Jen.

535
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:53,587
It's like I told you,
only the lonely can play

536
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,510
Forget about it,
you look fantastic.

537
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,953
Yeah, it's him, I got it.

538
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,462
What are you doing here?

539
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,735
I thought it would be a
good time to come by

540
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,275
and get some of
my stuff back.

541
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,775
What stuff?

542
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,937
I thought we did
this already.

543
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:46,279
No, I had an extra box of
stuff in the back bedroom.

544
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,181
Oh, I threw it out, I
thought it was garbage.

545
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:48,752
You threw it out?

546
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,878
Jen come on, you
didn't throw it out.

547
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,513
There were two important
baseballs in there.

548
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,819
It couldn't have been too
important if you left them here.

549
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,518
No, they were important,
they were real important.

550
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,323
They were valuable
collectors items.

551
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,454
Collectibles.

552
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,498
Grow the fuck up, Mike.

553
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,534
I mean, don't you see
that's why we broke up.

554
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,398
You are a child.

555
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,563
What man in his
thirties, do you know

556
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,300
that cares about
baseballs and comics

557
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,932
an d all that other
adolescent shit

558
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,601
that you obsess over!

559
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,387
How... how you
been otherwise?

560
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,321
Go away, Mike.

561
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:26,981
You look really good...

562
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:27,751
Jen come on!

563
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,986
Did I tell you Paulie's
getting married this weekend?

564
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,255
Yeah Mike, you
told me that.

565
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,955
Yeah, it's exciting.

566
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:33,621
Really exciting.

567
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,757
I got a tux, it's nice.

568
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,563
I... I don't have
a date for that,

569
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,194
you should come,
you know all the guys.

570
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,899
You know my little brother
is back from college.

571
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,976
Yeah?

572
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,566
So?

573
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,111
So.

574
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,545
I think you should
stop, stopping by.

575
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,618
And if you don't, I think
I'll have him take care of it.

576
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,707
Who Top cat?

577
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,047
You're threatening me
with my little brother?

578
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,384
Yeah, he's not so
little anymore.

579
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,117
Wow, man, you know what?

580
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,487
You just want to throw
me under the bus,

581
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,321
toss me out
of your life

582
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,225
like we never had
anything, cool,

583
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,228
that's fine with me, Jen.

584
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,231
I don't give a shit,
you can do that.

585
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,928
Fine, whatever man...

586
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,601
All right, you know what?

587
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,264
Do me a favor, see if you
ever meet another guy,

588
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,932
like me, in
your whole life!

589
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,340
Ever, 'cause I got
news for you, Jen.

590
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,308
Guys like me, nice guys.

591
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,243
cordial guys.

592
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:22,938
Huh, Yeah...

593
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,015
that's me...

594
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,639
We're far an d
few between, Jen.

595
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,012
Far and few between,
so good luck,

596
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,142
go enjoy your lonely life.

597
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,050
'Cause I can't
do it anymore.

598
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,213
I'm done, fine!

599
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:35,921
I got your bike...

600
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,622
I got your bike
in my truck.

601
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,663
I've been driving
it around,

602
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,527
trying to figure out

603
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,533
when would be the right
time to bring it over.

604
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,796
The right time?

605
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:46,598
Yeah, the right time.

606
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,570
I got your bike.

607
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,662
It's in my truck.

608
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,802
There you go, I put all the
reflectors back on for you.

609
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,108
Thank you, Mike.

610
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,682
Give Paulie and
Sue my best.

611
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,045
You look great.

612
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,318
Jen, come on,
let's work it out.

613
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,618
Come on, talk...

614
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,126
Jen talk to me.

615
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:10,956
Talk to me Jen,

616
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,290
whatever I
did, I'm sorry.

617
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,093
I don't even know what
I did and I'm sorry!

618
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,259
Jen!

619
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,360
Jennifer come on, Jen!

620
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,495
What you yellin' for!

621
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,765
Mind your fuckin'
business!

622
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,033
That's what!

623
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,104
You're not even close.

624
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,768
I am close.

625
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,814
Hey, Jimbo, Jimbo, what was
that song you wrote for Jules

626
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,177
when you were trying to
woo her, in High School.

627
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,045
What was it?

628
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,119
Woo me, is that
what you call it?

629
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,620
He had ulterior motives
if I remember correctly.

630
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,654
Remember that song
you wrote for her,

631
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,555
back when you
were trying to...

632
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,059
You know what I mean.

633
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,856
Back in the day, remember?

634
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,760
You're talking
like 20 years ago?

635
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,264
Come on, come on,
don't be a prick.

636
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,890
He used to play
all the time...

637
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,626
come on, what was it...

638
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,226
How'd it go.

639
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,000
Hey Jules...

640
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,301
Don't you play
me for no fool...

641
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,000
Jesus christ,

642
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:58,541
that was back in
High School, man.

643
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,871
How am I supposed
to remember that?

644
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,377
Jimmy, you're
so full of shit,

645
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,777
you didn't
forget the song.

646
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,850
I don't remember the song.

647
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,009
Oh, you remember every
note to "Stairway to Heaven"

648
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,485
but you can't remember
three cords you wrote for me.

649
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,215
I haven't played "Stairway
to Heaven" for years,

650
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,255
Jesus, come on.

651
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,087
That's not the
fuckin' point!

652
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,491
Hey, why don't you just
grab the guitar and play it...

653
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,654
ook, I don't remember
the fuckin' son g.

654
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,164
If I remembered the song,
I would play the song.

655
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:22,756
Okay!

656
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,425
But I don't
remember, I'm sorry!

657
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,675
I'm having a tough
time, Paulie,

658
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,442
I don't know
what's going on.

659
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,418
You know what it is?

660
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,953
I get over come
with emotions.

661
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,114
Yoou know, I'm completely
flooded with emotion.

662
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,216
I start crying, my heart gets
all heavy, I can't drive,

663
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,386
cause every song I hear on
the radio reminds me of her.

664
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,191
Right.

665
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,356
And I know I shouldn't go
over there and see her,

666
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,364
but I can't
help myself,

667
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,025
I got to see her
with my own eyes.

668
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,036
Seriously, you got
to calm down, man.

669
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,230
I mean, there are
other women out there,

670
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,364
give yourself time, and
you'll meet somebody new.

671
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,568
But not that hot
Paulie, she's so hot.

672
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,167
And that ass,
God, Paulie...

673
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,370
Where am I going to
find somebody that hot,

674
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,469
that likes back, again.

675
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,348
That's a combo in
this life time.

676
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,649
Look, you know,
when I met Sue,

677
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,122
she was kinda
going through

678
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,318
what you're going
through now.

679
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,292
She was datin g this clown
from Staten Islan d,

680
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,089
when I was working
over there

681
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,323
and I'd see her on
the ferry occasionally.

682
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,698
And one night,
I'm coming back.

683
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,931
And I see her,
and she's crying.

684
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,338
So, I go over to
her, you know,

685
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,638
being the nice
cordial guy that I am.

686
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,677
I ask her how she's doin'.

687
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,906
And she tells me
the story about,

688
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,311
about how she just
found out her boyfriend

689
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,282
was cheating on her.

690
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:51,151
So I walked her home and
asked her, you know,

691
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,655
maybe when she's
feelin g better,

692
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,089
maybe she let
me take her out.

693
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,820
Maybe, ahh...

694
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,726
maybe let me make
something of her life.

695
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,321
Month later, she called.

696
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,831
Here we are.

697
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,992
Baby on the way.

698
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,103
I didn't know that's
how you guys met

699
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,265
on the ferry like that.

700
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,865
That's romantic, Paulie.

701
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,874
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,877
That's really romantic.

703
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,105
How come you never
told me that before?

704
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,019
I don't know, that kinda shit
just doesn't come up, does it?

705
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,523
What about Violet,
I like that.

706
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,649
That could be a good name.

707
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,489
No, no flowers.

708
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,789
And no virtuous
names either.

709
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,386
ike Hope, Faith
or Chastity.

710
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,228
She should have a regular
name like Liz, or Betty.

711
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,495
Liz or Betty.

712
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,868
Now you are aware that
those are the same names,

713
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,965
right, they're both
nicknames for Elizabeth.

714
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,202
You know what, I
didn't know that.

715
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,275
You know what
we should do,

716
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,473
we should do what
Dez and Tina did.

717
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,448
They waited until
their boys were born.

718
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,779
check out their
personalities,

719
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,615
an d then they name them.

720
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,781
Oh so, are you waiting to
check out her personality,

721
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,359
before you finish
painting her room?

722
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,325
I'm going to get to
the room, all right?

723
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,162
How about Betty?

724
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,632
You like Betty?

725
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,463
I like it.

726
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,593
Elizabeth it is then.

727
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,500
I like Elizabeth.

728
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,038
- Okay.
- Okay.

729
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,221
Where do you think
you're going?

730
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,761
I got an eight o'clock
tee time with Paulie

731
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,091
and the guys, I'm late for.

732
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,130
You're not doin' anything.

733
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,096
I going to work

734
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,599
and it's your turn to
take the kids to school.

735
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,066
8 o'clock tee time.

736
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,332
Desmond, you're the
adult, they're the kids.

737
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,030
Okay.

738
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,731
I'll see you tonight.

739
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,308
come on boys!

740
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,242
Let's look alive, Daddy's
taking you to school.

741
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,141
Love you.

742
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,339
You too babe.

743
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,540
Boys, let's go!

744
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,864
I'm gonna go
to work, okay?

745
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:44,490
I remember, when
we first met

746
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:50,727
You were, standing
by the pool

747
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:58,367
Smoking on a cigarette

748
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:08,875
You asked me to the
Sadie Hawken's dance

749
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:19,363
I spent all night, trying
to get into your...

750
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,400
Hey Jules

751
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:33,001
What we gonna do,
come September

752
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:40,142
and when you go
off to school

753
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:50,422
Hey Jules, you're just
hangin' with a fool

754
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,361
I'm not cheating on you

755
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,365
I'll never let
go of you

756
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,653
Nice shot, man.

757
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,091
Thank you Bro'.

758
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,059
That still doesn't explain

759
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,793
why you took his
baseball card though.

760
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,732
'cause I was mad at
Mike about something,

761
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,235
so I did it just
to piss him off,

762
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,895
you know stupid kid stuff.

763
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,974
Stupid kid stuff is the
fact that eight years later

764
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,270
he's still
pissed about it.

765
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,675
Wait 'til he finds out I
only got 40 bucks for it.

766
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,178
You're kidding me,
you only got 40?

767
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:43,906
Yeah.

768
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:44,845
can you believe that
jack ass thought

769
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,541
he was going to retire off that?

770
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,086
And why was it so urgent
to get out of town

771
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
and then why not call
anybody all this time.

772
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,386
Oh come on, Paulie,

773
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,326
if anybody was going
to get it, it would be you.

774
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,624
Bro', I have no idea what
you're talking about.

775
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,858
Well, the reason that I
left the way that I did,

776
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,935
was because...

777
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,298
Well, I accepted
something about myself

778
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,736
that I knew you
guys couldn't.

779
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,273
We're your best friends,

780
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,035
what wouldn't we
accept about you?

781
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,145
Paulie, I'm gay.

782
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:30,591
Hey you know, I'm honest
with myself, I probably...

783
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,754
probably crossed my
mind a couple of times.

784
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,559
You never really allowed yourself
to really believe it, right?

785
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,632
Yeah, yeah I guess.

786
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,136
Yoeah, well welcome to the
first 25 years of my life, man.

787
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,540
So... that's just
what you do now?

788
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,271
Or...

789
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,848
No dude, that's
who I am now.

790
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,749
Yeah, that's what I meant.

791
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,184
Just hit the
ball, come on.

792
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,220
Made ya' nervous,
didn't I?

793
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,388
ittle bit.

794
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,159
ittle bit.

795
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,565
I'm tellin' ya, my dad
flipped when I told him.

796
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,931
I'm sure, what did he say?

797
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,632
You can imagine.

798
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,638
My dad's old school, like,

799
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,301
It was the hardest thing
I ever had to do, man.

800
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,071
I just really prepared
my announcement to him

801
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,240
and then, when
at dinner, I says to him,

802
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,046
"Dad, could you pass the
salt to a homosexual."

803
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:32,554
And my Dad just stayed
real quiet for a long time.

804
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,525
And then he says to me, "Are
you seeing a psychiatrist?"

805
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,960
ike I got some kin d of
sickness or somethin g.

806
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,830
And then he says to
me, with real disgust,

807
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:48,838
"Be safe."

808
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,899
And that was it,
man, that was it.

809
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,272
That was it.

810
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,679
Hey, Dez!

811
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,772
can we talk for a second
at what a stupid idea

812
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,977
it is to have a softball
game for a bachelor party.

813
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,610
come on.

814
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,518
What the hell is
that all about?

815
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,590
You know what we
should be doing.

816
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,555
Yeah, playin' basketball.

817
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,319
No man, we should
be gettin' a limo,

818
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,689
we should be packin'
it full of strippers

819
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,195
and we should all be gettin',

820
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,924
you know, on our way
down to Atlantic city.

821
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,158
Our wives would love that.

822
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,734
He wants to play softball,
we're playin' softball.

823
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,234
Oh, God, softball,
that's a lot of fun.

824
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,362
You all right?

825
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,404
He said, uh,

826
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,064
He says you were
judgmental yesterday.

827
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,040
Who did,
He did?

828
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,940
Paulie said I was
being judgmental?

829
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,605
Yeah.

830
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,080
He said that to you?

831
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,616
When?

832
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,242
The other day.

833
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,752
He said I was being
judgmental the other day?

834
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:37,548
To you?

835
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,886
He didn't say shit to me,
look, the other day, we talked

836
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,459
I was just telling him
what my feelings were,

837
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,653
you know what I mean,
he's my brother.

838
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,820
I can't give him advice.

839
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,921
Don't give him advice
unless he asks for it.

840
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,431
No, that's what a older
brother's supposed to do.

841
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,558
You know Paulie, he's not
going to ask for advice.

842
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,500
Just do every one
a favor, all right.

843
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,003
For the next couple days,
keep your opinions

844
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,769
about Sue to yourself.

845
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,706
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

846
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,243
What's that mean?

847
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,644
Did he say, I said
something about Sue?

848
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,876
Jesus christ, I'm just
lookin' out for him, man.

849
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:07,712
I mean, seriously,

850
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,682
you think he's
doing this thing

851
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,185
because he loves this girl?

852
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,587
Or do you think he's doing
it because he knocked her up.

853
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,784
No, I think he's doing it
for all the right reasons.

854
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,860
He loves her.

855
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,727
I still don't understand

856
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,889
why you're letting his
asinine comments bother you.

857
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,990
Sue, how could
they not bother me.

858
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,331
Because they would only
bother you if they were true.

859
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,099
ook, he's my brother
an d my best man.

860
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,140
He's supposed to
be supportive.

861
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,903
Just think about what his
speech is going to be like.

862
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,207
To Paulie and Sue, I think
you're making a huge mistake.

863
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,781
But good luck, you're
gonna need it.

864
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,043
What do you think, Paulie.

865
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,641
You think we're
making a mistake.

866
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,343
What?

867
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,112
What are you
talking about.

868
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,982
No.

869
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,885
Well are you excited
to get married?

870
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,117
Sue, of course I'm
excited to get married.

871
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,852
ook, all I'm sayin g

872
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,087
is maybe Jimbo shouldn't
be the best man,

873
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,994
if he feels the
way he does.

874
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,327
I mean think about it, it
just doesn't feel right.

875
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,833
How do you feel, Paulie?

876
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,459
Would you still propose to
me if I weren't pregnant?

877
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,969
Of course.

878
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,096
But...

879
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,264
Iook...

880
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,706
It's an unfair question,
because you are pregnant.

881
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,338
And, I'm not going to put
myself into a hypothetical.

882
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,576
If you're doing this outta some
kind of obligation, Paulie,

883
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,015
then you can
forget about it.

884
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,849
I want to get
married to you.

885
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,547
'Cause I love you.

886
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,284
But if you don't feel
the same way about me,

887
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,723
then you can just
forget about it.

888
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,351
Sue, Sue,

889
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,054
Of course I feel
the same way.

890
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,790
You know, you're
being irrational.

891
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,195
Yes, I love you,

892
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,063
but can I say
that positively,

893
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,535
I'm ready to get
married and have kids?

894
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,697
I don't know.

895
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,434
Excuse me?

896
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,272
Then what are we
doing here, Paulie!

897
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,871
This is real life, okay.

898
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,609
These are the cards
we were dealt.

899
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,878
The cards we were dealt?

900
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,351
This is not a God
damn hand of poker

901
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,218
that's poppin' out
of my belly, Paulie!

902
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,624
Sue, this is crazy, we're
getting married in 3 days.

903
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,093
I just told you
what my brother said

904
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,927
'cause it pissed me off!

905
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:07,060
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:07,933
You know what I
was thinking,

907
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,206
You should get into
upper management.

908
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,104
I was in upper management.

909
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,039
No, I'm not
talking about work,

910
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,702
I'm talking about, your family.

911
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:15,471
Your wife.

912
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,739
You guys should
start a family.

913
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,212
It'd settle you down, man.

914
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,907
Get rid of all that
noise in your head.

915
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,679
Where's this coming from?

916
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,618
It's just...

917
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,280
You have a kid,
you walk in light.

918
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,089
It gives you a reason to
wake up in the morning.

919
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,253
Walk in the light?

920
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,331
Yeah.

921
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,957
What, Too much?

922
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,534
Too heavy?

923
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,660
Yo.

924
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,101
What the fuck?

925
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,069
What?

926
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:42,730
Where are you?

927
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,432
What?

928
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,566
I'm gettin'
lunch with Dez.

929
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,438
Why?

930
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,034
You asked me if you could
work a couple days this week.

931
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,874
Don't you remember asking
me if you could work today?

932
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,947
Did we say today?

933
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,276
Yeah, we said today.

934
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,476
I fuckin' forgot, I was
gettin' tuxedo's with Dez.

935
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,142
Yeah.

936
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,583
I got mine this
morning, nice.

937
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,381
Cummerbun d.

938
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,819
Forget about it,
it's all over.

939
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,891
Man, I got Dez, we
can't do this tomorrow?

940
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,015
No, we can't do
it tomorrow.

941
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,593
Tomorrow's Paulie's
softball game.

942
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,991
Yo, Jimbo, you're really
kind of screwing me here,

943
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:05,618
I'm short a man.

944
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,559
I got a job to do.

945
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,256
come on, Mike, God damn it,

946
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,491
I'm going through
some shit in my life.

947
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,329
Real shit right now, and
you give me a hard time

948
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,699
about edgin g some
fuckin' lawn.

949
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,634
I'll talk to you later.

950
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,546
Wally chara, never
walked onto the mound.

951
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,616
So my little guy

952
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,412
is jumping up and
down on the bed, right.

953
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,750
And he says to me, say,
hey dad, pull my finger, right.

954
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,620
So I pull his finger,
but instead of farting,

955
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,817
the little guy,

956
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,895
he's in shorts and
he shits himself!

957
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:44,832
The little guy shits
himself right there.

958
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,027
What did you do?

959
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:49,264
I said, "Son, you're an
idiot, clean your shit up."

960
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,000
Well, that's really
understanding of you man.

961
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,440
If you shit yourself,
you got to pick it up.

962
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,482
I don't like that story at
all, it's kinda of sad.

963
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,709
You know cousin, Mike, you
have to tell the story

964
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,080
about the time you
pissed your pants.

965
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,210
Which time was that?

966
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,877
What time was that...

967
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,615
Sisters Dorothy's class.

968
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,213
I think you
were 1 1 th grade.

969
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,315
Sister Dorothy's
class was 4th grade.

970
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,620
You know what,
let Jimbo tell it.

971
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,592
'cause he was
in the class,

972
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,719
he sat right behind me.

973
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,956
6th grade.

974
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,292
What's the difference,
I pissed my pants,

975
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,889
who cares what
grade it was.

976
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,095
Okay, so we're in
Sister Dorothy's class

977
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,172
and Mikey's sitting two
seats up in front of me.

978
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,640
He says, raises his hand,
"can I go to the bathroom?"

979
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,074
She says, "No."

980
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,338
All right, so
ten minutes pass,

981
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,970
he raises his
hand again, says,

982
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:31,979
"can I go to the bathroom?"

983
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:32,946
And she says, "No," again.

984
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,039
And she knows
I'm suffering,

985
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,584
'cause she can see
the pain in my eyes.

986
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,017
And you know what,
she doesn't care,

987
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,349
because she's a nun.

988
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,116
And she likes to
see kids suffer.

989
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,158
Yeah, and this
is a big day.

990
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,021
We had these
special reports,

991
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:43,957
this book report.

992
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,585
You had done, uh...

993
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,824
you'd drawn this
picture of Tom Seaver.

994
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,195
Remember you spent
days doing it,

995
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,791
this really passionate...

996
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,994
It was awesome!

997
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:53,728
It had to be passionate.

998
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:54,735
It was about the '69 Mets.

999
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,930
Right?

1000
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,166
Tom Seaver,
your favorite.

1001
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:57,831
So I drew a picture

1002
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,068
of Tom Terrific
on the mound.

1003
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,610
Wham, with that fast ball,
inside-out cuttin' action.

1004
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,406
Go ahead.

1005
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,038
So, some other kid's
readin' his report.

1006
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,275
And I hear whimpering.

1007
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,783
And I look up, and it's
Mikey and he's shakin'.

1008
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,376
Okay, and I wonder what
the Hell is going on.

1009
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,546
Iook down and I notice
there's a big...

1010
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,489
There's a pool of
piss in his seat.

1011
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,585
And it's dripping down,
right on top of Tom Seaver.

1012
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,857
Right on top of this
report this poor kid,

1013
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,091
and then the other
kids are noticing.

1014
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,791
And he starts to cry.

1015
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,335
Okay, then Sister
Dorothy notices,

1016
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,995
and you know
what she says.

1017
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,006
She says, "Stop
being such a baby."

1018
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,234
That's fucked up.

1019
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,470
Yeah, but what does
my big brother do?

1020
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,170
I mean, the protector
of all of us.

1021
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,145
Jimbo, check this out,
comes over to my desk,

1022
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,146
grabs me by my hand,

1023
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,511
he says "come on,
we're leaving."

1024
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,552
And he just walks me
through the class.

1025
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,143
And he walks me
right up to the door,

1026
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,414
and Sister Dorothy goes,

1027
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,285
"Where do you two
think you're going?"

1028
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,416
How the fuck have I
never heard this story?

1029
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,424
You've heard this
story before.

1030
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,188
I've never heard
this story, before.

1031
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,786
You were probably too
busy worrying about

1032
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,229
how to get the band together
or something like that.

1033
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,563
You guys don't
want to rock?

1034
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,397
I do want to rock.

1035
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,663
I just don't want you
to keep asking me

1036
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,033
what fuckin' dot we're on.

1037
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:07,202
You're a bunch of dicks, I don't
know why I call you friends.

1038
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,903
Come on, let Jimbo
finish his story.

1039
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,345
And I said, "Get
out of our way."

1040
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,244
No, that's not
what he said,

1041
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,475
that's not what he said.

1042
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,074
Jimbo looks at Sister
Dorothy and says,

1043
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,152
I quote,

1044
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,050
"Get the fuck
out of our way."

1045
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,679
But here's the best part.

1046
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,449
What's better than that?

1047
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,285
Here's the best part,

1048
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,950
She does.

1049
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,527
She clears outta the way,
they walk right out

1050
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,222
of the front door of
the school and go home.

1051
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,266
That's the kind of
big brother I got.

1052
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,527
To big Jim, huh.

1053
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,068
My best man.

1054
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,569
I'll toast to that!

1055
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,505
Jimbo, that was
beautiful, man!

1056
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,635
What about me I'm the one
that pissed my pants.

1057
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,007
Paulie, would
you be pissed at me

1058
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,171
if I didn't come
to your wedding,

1059
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,078
'cause I'm startin' to
feel kin da weird about it.

1060
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,878
Look, I know you're drunk,

1061
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,714
so I'm not going to pay
too much attention to this,

1062
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,310
but what the Hell are
you feelin' weird about?

1063
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,719
I don't even have
a girlfriend,

1064
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,188
I don't have a girlfriend,
I live in the same house

1065
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,588
I grew up in, I
have the same job

1066
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,320
I had when I was
in High School.

1067
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,656
That'd be great if
I was 23 years old,

1068
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,922
but I'm not 23 years old.

1069
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,430
I'm 33 years old.

1070
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,125
When am I goin g to have a
family, he's got a family,

1071
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,428
he's got two
beautiful boys.

1072
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,503
You're starting a family.

1073
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:07,627
Where's my family.

1074
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,137
What, when I'm an old man?

1075
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,968
What's that got to do with
you not going to his wedding.

1076
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,064
A lot!

1077
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,666
I don't want everyone
asking me about Jen

1078
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,608
and be answering questions
about Jen all night!

1079
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,680
Who's going to be asking?

1080
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,372
Who?

1081
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,278
Listen to me, Michael.

1082
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,441
You're my cousin, right?

1083
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,246
You're coming to my wedding.

1084
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,512
All right, Paulie.

1085
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,609
Go to bed.

1086
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:31,091
Get some sleep.

1087
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:31,889
I'm gonna call her.

1088
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,758
No, no, you're not going to
call anybody, all right.

1089
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,888
You're going to go to
bed, we've got softball

1090
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,124
first thin g in the mornin g.

1091
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,326
Hey, see you tomorrow!

1092
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,369
Hey, why don't you wake up
the whole neighborhood.

1093
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,898
Smarten up!

1094
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:45,633
Enough already!

1095
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,041
My kids are sleeping.

1096
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,806
I'm sorry, Dez.

1097
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,885
Hey, Pop, let's go fish!

1098
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,615
Ain't gettin' married
so much fun?

1099
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,691
Oh yeah, lot of fun.

1100
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,054
Lot of fun.

1101
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,859
Every time a
guy gets married,

1102
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,660
he gets divorced
from his friends.

1103
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,665
And his buddies

1104
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,601
are never going to be a hundred
percent supportive of that.

1105
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:14,568
This has been
a weird week.

1106
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,229
You know, I mean, like...

1107
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,364
Jimbo all of a sudden

1108
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,942
seemed like his
old-self tonight, right?

1109
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,135
Yeah.

1110
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,975
I should just keep
him as the best man,

1111
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,548
but then I have
cousin Mike

1112
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,173
telling me he doesn't want
to go to the fuckin' wedding.

1113
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,683
What the Hell
is that about?

1114
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,912
It's training
you for kids.

1115
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,885
It's God's way of
training you for kids.

1116
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,115
I mean, every
day you wake up,

1117
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,123
they can have completely
different personalities.

1118
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,487
Trust me.

1119
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,357
Man I got to tell you
Dez, I'm freaking out

1120
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,191
about that man.

1121
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:44,666
I mean, how do you
the whole kids thing?

1122
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,463
Honestly?

1123
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,504
You have one kid,

1124
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:52,473
you loose a little bit of
your life, little free time,

1125
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,443
little bit of
your freedom.

1126
00:46:55,546 --> 00:47:00,506
You have two kids,
life is over, Joe-Joe.

1127
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,018
So why do it, I mean...

1128
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,419
Why did you and Tina
have another kid?

1129
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,013
What do you do with
your free time?

1130
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,990
Honestly, what do you do?

1131
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,390
You watch TV.

1132
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,326
You go and hang out with
these knuckle heads.

1133
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,761
You jerk off, right.

1134
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:15,422
isten to me,

1135
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:20,196
Free time, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

1136
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,067
But at the end
of the night.

1137
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,605
If I couldn't...

1138
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,175
you know...

1139
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,245
If I couldn't
go upstairs...

1140
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,404
check in on
my little boys,

1141
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,947
if I couldn't
look at them,

1142
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,984
make sure they're okay.

1143
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,110
My life...

1144
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:41,851
My life...

1145
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:45,360
My life would be empty,
is what it would be.

1146
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,794
There are people
that know,

1147
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,160
and there are people
that don't know.

1148
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:54,226
And you my man, are about
to be a man that knows.

1149
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,669
All right man.

1150
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,639
- All right.
- All right, thank you.

1151
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:03,042
- No fear.
- Sleep tight.

1152
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,637
Paulie.

1153
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,014
You know I'm doin' this
whole band thing for you,

1154
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,644
so, you know, if you
don't wanna do it,

1155
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,949
Just let me
know, all right.

1156
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,389
Dez, I'm into
it, all right.

1157
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,960
Nice.

1158
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,050
That's good, hey,

1159
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,254
if you could just
get the other guys

1160
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,559
a little excited about
it, that would great.

1161
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,223
It's important.

1162
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,234
Really important
that we do this.

1163
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,826
All right?

1164
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,633
Paulie,

1165
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,832
and just remember

1166
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:35,378
when we rock out,
shirts are optional, baby.

1167
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,743
Go to bed, Desmond.

1168
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,906
Shh.

1169
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,162
These guys are
in uniforms,

1170
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,130
we're gonna get crushed.

1171
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,758
All right, let's
bring it in here!

1172
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,336
All right now, come
on, take a knee.

1173
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,674
Get your hat off, Jimbo,
let's go, hats off.

1174
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,404
I'm good,
I'm good.

1175
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,310
Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

1176
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,610
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

1177
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,446
on Earth is it
is in Heaven.

1178
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,713
Give us this day,
our daily bread.

1179
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,550
Forgive us for
our trespasses,

1180
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,147
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1181
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,524
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1182
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,460
- Amen.
- Amen.

1183
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,963
All right, bring it
in here real quick,

1184
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,624
we do burned tongue on three.

1185
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,530
One, two, three!

1186
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,693
Burned tongue!

1187
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,703
It's going
right out there!

1188
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,602
Come on, Jimbo!

1189
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,606
Come on!

1190
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,509
All right Jimbo,
get ready to move!

1191
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,847
Come on, Paulie,
do your thin g!

1192
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,183
Come on, Paulie!

1193
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,085
Paulie!

1194
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:39,926

1195
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,793
What do you say
to that, hotdog!

1196
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,661
Come on, big mouth!

1197
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,462
Come on, big mouth!

1198
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,503
Oh, Tc, you stink!

00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,705
Nice rip, cuz'.

1200
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:52,433
Good to see you've
been the cages.

1201
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,099
Nice one, Mike!

1202
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,108
Way to go,

1203
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:19,802
I got it!

1204
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,131
I got it!

1205
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,830
What the fuck is your
fuckin' problem!

1206
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:23,769
What the fuck are
you talking about!

1207
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,898
It was my ball,

1208
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,305

tried to fuckin' get it.

1209

They why didn't

00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,044
Because you fuckin'

1211
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,511
I didn't want to get
barreled over by you!

1212
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,308
Fuck you!

1213
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,676

00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,909

1215
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,815
Hey, you know what
Jimbo, fuck you, man.

1216
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,648
No, fuck you, man!

1217
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,448
Go fuck yourself!

1218
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,385
Fuck you!

1219
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,220
You've been a fuckin'
prick every...

1220
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,055
All right, break it up!

1221
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,630
Get off!

1222
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,221
Fuckin' prick!

1223
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,323
Fuck you, Paulie!

1224
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,026
I'll fuck you up!

1225
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,661
Hey, hey, hey!

1226
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,534
Knock it off!

1227
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,005
Fuck man!

1228
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,736
Paulie, come on.

1229
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,936
You know what?

1230
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,034
I'm fuckin'
done, all right!

1231
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:03,942
I'm goin' home!

1232
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,776
Good, you big

1233
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,371
Boohoo!

1234
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:07,541
And you know,

1235
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,208
how about this,

1236
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,444
You're not going
to be my best man!

1237
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,815
How about that,
you fuckin' prick!

1238
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,513
What, because of this?

1239
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,418
Yeah, because of this!

1240
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,047
It's a fuckin'
softball game,

1241
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,216
I'm your fuckin' brother!

1242
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,419

Fuck you, Paulie,

1246
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,664
I don't want to part
of your wedding anyway.

1247
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,290
Fuck your fucking wedding.

1248
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,368
Don't say anything you're
going to regret man.

1249
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,127
Fuck you!

1250
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,101
And I'm the fuckin'
center fielder, bitch!

1251
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,741
can I talk to you
about something?

1252
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,412
Jesus christ, baby, It's
not a good time, trust me.

1253
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,491
Just hear me out, 'cause
I really need to talk to you.

1254
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,686
Why does everyone fuckin'
need to talk to me right now?

1255
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,695
Are you crying?

1256
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,196
ike you give a shit.

1257
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:55,992
Of course I give a shit, baby,

1258
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,124
my brother just fuckin'
wigged out on me.

1259
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,930
Just keep it
together, all right.

1260
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,936
Yoou're a selfish
fuckin asshole!

1261
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:02,629
You know that!

1262
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,501
What do you want me to do!

1263
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,266
Just go to Hell!

1264
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,033
You want to talk!

1265
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:05,732
Yeah, I want to talk!

1266
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,831
All right, let's talk!

Bullshit, I'm listening,

00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,381
I'm fuckin' waiting,
I'm right here!

1272
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,384
I'm going to
take a shower!

1273
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,015
My fuckin brother...

1274
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:48,814
Fuck!

1275
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,822
Hello?

1276
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,231
Hey Julianna,
it's Paulie,

1277
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,496
Is Jimbo around?

1278
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,799
Oh no, he just left.

1279
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,134
lf, umm...

1280
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,539
if you speak to him later,
could you have him call me.

1281
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,545
We just had a stupid situation
at the softball game.

1282
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,639
And I just don't like
the way I left things.

1283
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,776
Fine Paulie, if I hear
from him, I'll tell him.

1284
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,184
Hey, is everything
all right,

1285
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,778
you soun d, you
soun d a little upset.

1286
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,859
Everything's fine.

1287
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,620
I'll pass along
the message, okay.

1288
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,662
Boys, where you at!

1289
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:39,735
We're in here, Dad!

1290
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,797
Hey, grab your axes,
let's practice.

1291
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,397
Dad, we practiced
all ready.

1292
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,408
Yo, gentlemen, when I ask
you to do something,

1293
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,273
I expect you to do it.

1294
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,846
Let's go, chop-chop!

1295
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:51,879
come on.

1296
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,750
What you
talkin' about?

1297
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,882
Blues is awesome.

1298
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,358
Okay what were we
working on last week?

1299
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,793
Dad, you know our
band is so lame.

1300
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,523
What is it?

1301
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,758
overboy,
somethin g like that.

1302
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,698
Loverboy, '85,
the best of,

1303
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:13,359
Let's go.

1304
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:13,902
No.

1305
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,197
Rock out.

1306
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:15,930
Fine.

1307
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,269
I'll slap a
headband on you.

1308
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,137
Go.

1309
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,937
No.

1310
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,305
Grab your bass.

1311
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,312
Just play.

1312
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,255
That's it, listen
to each other.

1313
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,538
I was born to run,
i was born to dream

1314
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,244
The craziest boy
you've ever seen

1315
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:06,686
I got to do it my way

1316
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,591
Or no way at all

1317
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,185
And I was here to please,
I'm even on my knees

1318
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,061
Makin' love to
whoever I please

1319
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,625
I got to do it my way

1320
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,602
Or no way at all

1321
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:23,770
Mike, don't you
even want to know

1322
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,204
why I didn't call
you all these years.

1323
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,003
I really don't give a
shit at this point, Tc.

1324
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,338
come on, come on, don't
you think it would have

1325
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,434
to be something really
heavy for me

1326
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,877
to take off and not
tell you about it,

1327
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,947
comeo on.

1328
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:32,980
We shared everything,
man, when my mom died,

1329
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,982
who did I go to first, Huh?

1330
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:35,982
I went to you.

1331
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,017
We shared everything.

1332
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,849
Yeah, so I thought.

1333
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:39,546
I also thought,

1334
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,588
we were going
to go in together

1335
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,918
on my Dad's
landscaping business.

1336
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,652
Not me, We.

1337
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,590
Both of us.

1338
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,820
I know, I know.

1339
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:46,554
No one knows how
to get hold of you.

1340
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:47,925
Your father doesn't even
know where to reach you.

1341
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,362
And then I'm left
holding the bag

1342
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,262
on the landscaping
business.

1343
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,765
I know I didn't
handle it right, okay.

1344
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,425
Handle it?

1345
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,263
You didn't
handle anything,

1346
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,495
what the fuck
did you handle?

1347
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,065
Mike, I'm gay.

1348
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,305
What?

1349
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:07,975
The reason I left, is
because I'm a homosexual.

1350
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,052
You didn't talk to
me for eight years,

1351
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,313
'cause you're a gay?

1352
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,615
That doesn't even
make fuckin' sense.

1353
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,713
It does make sense, 'cause
when I told my Dad about it,

1354
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,518
he couldn't
deal with it,

1355
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,320
so what made me
think my friends

1356
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,655
could handle it
any better, huh?

1357
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:19,819
Because we were
your friends!

1358
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:20,987
And I was your
best friend, man!

1359
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,621
Jesus christ, what
did you think,

1360
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:23,926
I wasn't going to
talk to you again

1361
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,091
for the rest of our lives?

1362
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,668
That's what wound up
happening anyway,

1363
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,236
why didn't you
gamble on me, man!

1364
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,138
'cause I just didn't
think you'd understand.

1365
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,176
So you take my Tom Seaver
fuckin' rookie card?

1366
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,767
That was my favorite
card in the world!

1367
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:36,743
That's the one you take?

1368
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,904
No, do you want to know

1369
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,276
why I stole your
Tom Seaver card?

1370
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:39,848
Yeah.

1371
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,916
You want to know why I
stole your Tom Seaver card.

1372
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:41,881
I just said I
want to know,

1373
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:42,679
what are we arguing about?

1374
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,582
I was pissed at you
man, that's why.

1375
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,676
can you imagine
being gay,

1376
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,483
and having your best friend
making faggot jokes

1377
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,081
24-7 every God
damn day of your life!

1378
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,558
Don't be such a
"fudge-packer" this.

1379
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:52,821
"Take it up the ass" that.

1380
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,861
Can you imagine bein g me?

1381
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,056
Be me for a
God damn day!

1382
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,530
So, I took the one thing I
knew would piss you off!

1383
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:58,692
You son of a bitch!

1384
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,057
Dad!

1385
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,134
Dad!

1386
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,395
Fuck you!

1387
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,980
Yo!

1388
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,777
What up B',

1389
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:55,509
what are you
doing around here,

1390
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:56,983
you going to see your Dad?

1391
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:57,984
Naw, hell no.

1392
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,520
Just walking around,
clearing my thoughts.

1393
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,782
You know.

1394
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,551
What about you, get over
your little tantrum?

1395
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,854
I will after the drink
I'm about to have.

1396
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:05,928
What is with you,
you're getting a drink,

1397
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,587
you don't invite me, I
go away for 8 years

1398
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:08,686
and all of a sudden
I'm an outcast?

1399
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:09,890
Shut the fuck up, get in.

1400
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:10,931
That's right.

1401
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,730
come on, son.

1402
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,439
Gary, get off my car.

1403
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,977
How many times
do I to tell you.

1404
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,603
Go join the Army
like your brother.

1405
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,607
I got five messages from
you, what do you want?

1406
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,516
What's up, twins.

1407
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,089
et me get a crun ch.

1408
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,420
I know why Tc took my
Tom Seaver rookie card.

1409
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,515
He told me.

1410
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,322
There's your crunch.

1411
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,989
He took my Tom Seaver
rookie card because he's gay.

1412
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,588
And he was mad at me

1413
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,394
because I kept
making gay jokes

1414
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,558
all through
high school.

1415
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,727
He's a gay guy, our best
friend's a gay guy,

1416
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,395
and we're all making gay
jokes, I felt terrible,

1417
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,972
but you made gay
jokes too, right?

1418
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,701
No, because I knew, I
knew before he did,

1419
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:53,867
I knew back in high school.

1420
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:54,908
How did you know
he was a gay?

1421
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,809
I was with him down
by the shore and...

1422
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,040
just you know.

1423
01:01:59,148 --> 01:01:59,978
I knew.

1424
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,448
How would you know,
are you a gay?

1425
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,245
No.

1426
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,819
Only on the weekends,
but don't tell my wife,

1427
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,821
pay for my crunch.

1428
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,982
et me get a screwball.

1429
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,151
come on, today.

1430
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,056
You know you're parked
in front of my house,

1431
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,890
this one's on the arm.

1432
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,691
Now this,

1433
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,892
this is where we should
have a bachelor party at.

1434
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,764
What is this?

1435
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,929
Oh man, come on.

1436
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,597
You're a married guy,
what are you doing here?

1437
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:25,867
You're not.

1438
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,567
Yeah, I don't like
these joints, man.

1439
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,872
Why, man, it's
fuckin g great!

1440
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,276
I'll tell you
something buddy,

1441
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,473
for the next hour,

1442
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,917
I'm not married, you
know what I'm saying?

1443
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,282
Gentlemen put your
hands together

1444
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,616
for the PBaroness
of PBurlesque!

1445
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,247
Chrystal!

1446
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,987
Oh, and here he is, one
of our regulars, Jimbo.

1447
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:46,857
Hi, Jimbo...

1448
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,022
Two whiskey's up here.

1449
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,066
Hey, chrystal, I didn't
know you worked Fridays.

1450
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,102
charming place.

1451
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,761
ooks all right to me.

1452
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,100
Hey, Mr. B!

1453
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,504
Hey Jimbo, what
do you say?

1454
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,633
Who's your friend?

1455
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,108
This is my friend Tc,
he's been my friend

1456
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,303
since we were 3 years old

1457
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,539
now he gives me a hard
time, just like you do.

1458
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,707
What are you giving
Jimbo a hard time about?

1459
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,614
I'm actually not, I'm just
trying to make sure he's okay,

1460
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,208
that's all.

1461
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,048
Yeah, I'm fine.

1462
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,783
I can tell you,
he is not okay.

1463
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:15,823
Look at him.

1464
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:16,516
It's the middle
of the afternoon,

1465
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,526
he's a married man
and he's in a titty bar.

1466
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,458
If that's doin' okay,

1467
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:20,756
the world
is upside down.

1468
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,660
Don't you start
in on me. All right.

1469
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,323
What do I tell this bum
every time I see him?

1470
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,559
He's lucky.

1471
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,533
He's lucky, he don't
know real hardship.

1472
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,229
He's like all the
kids your age.

1473
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,431
They're fuckin' babies,
crying all the time.

1474
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,568
Cryin' all the time instead
of knowin' you's are lucky.

1475
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,009
et me ask you
a question, TC.

1476
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,137
Are you married?

1477
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:38,975
Oh, Jesus christ.

1478
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,708
I've heard this speech
before, excuse me,

1479
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,784
I'm going to
be at the bar.

1480
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:42,782
No, sit down,

1481
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:46,446
Stay two seconds.

1482
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,989
Learn something
for a change.

1483
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,786
Are you married?

1484
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,793
No sir, no I'm not.

1485
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,522
- Any kids?
- No.

1486
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,188
You ever been
in the service?

1487
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,063
- No.
- See that figures,

1488
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,102
Because if you had
gone into the service,

1489
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,728
they would teach
you how to be a man.

1490
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,328
Oh, really?

1491
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,770
Instead, you stay home
with your mother,

1492
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,240
living in the same house
you were born in for 25 years.

1493
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,503
What happens?

1494
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,806
She teaches you how
to be a cheerleader.

1495
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,437
Definition of an adult

1496
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:16,075
is a person that has
a job, is married,

1497
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,018
has kids,
and owns a home.

1498
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,021
Okay.

1499
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,852
When I was growing up,

1500
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:26,190
the average age of
an adult, by that definition,

1501
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,229
was 24 years old.

1502
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,696
Now how old are you?

1503
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,235
I'm 35, sir.

1504
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,668
Christ had already
died on the cross

1505
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,830
for your sins by that age.

1506
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,909
Why don't you have
a wife and kids?

1507
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,978
'cause I'm gay, sir.

1508
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,015
That's why.

1509
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,478
Hey Jimbo, come
on, any day.

1510
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:51,450
I think we should
get out of here.

1511
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,179
come on.

1512
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,051
I'm having a drink with
my friend chrystal.

1513
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,386
I think we should go,
come on, let's go.

1514
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,119
Dude, if you wanna go, go.

1515
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,751
I just got here, man.

1516
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,695
come on, I want to talk
to you over here.

1517
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,959
If you wanna fuckin' go
Tc, just fuckin' go!

1518
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,557
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everything all right here?

1519
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,966
Yeah, it's fine.

1520
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:08,729
Everything's okay?

1521
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,672
Yoeah, he's a
frien d of mine.

1522
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,470
Excuse me ma'am, can I talk
to him for a minute, please?

1523
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,544
Tc, stop.

1524
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,168
Fuck.

1525
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,211
Think of Julianna,
come on.

1526
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,247
Don't you dare fuckin'
bring that shit up.

1527
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,816
Exactly, think about it.

1528
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,850
This is not
going to fix it.

1529
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,147
Tc, you are so fuckin'
close to gettin' slapped.

1530
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,052
Just get the fuck
outta my face.

1531
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:29,954
come on, I'm gonna
ask you one last time.

1532
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,287
Please come with
me right now.

1533
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,362
Okay, I tried man.

1534
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:38,023
I tried.

1535
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,465
Shut the fuck up.

1536
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,602
Uh oh!

1537
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,177
I hear thunder!

1538
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,213
ook at the ol'
man, he's an animal!

1539
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,748
Who's an animal!

1540
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,874
Look if you want her,
don't be a wuss,

1541
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:56,747
go and get her.

1542
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:57,682
I'm not a wuss, Pop.

1543
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,345
come on, she just don't
want to be bothered,

1544
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,444
that's all.

1545
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,614
Suit yourself.

1546
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,692
All right, Pops,
come on, let's go!

1547
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,090
Go get 'em, old man!

1548
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,458
Use the jab,
Pop, use the jab!

1549
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,405
Jenny!

1550
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:19,371
Hey Jen!

1551
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,238
Jennifer!

1552
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,868
Come on out!

1553
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,741
Jenny!

1554
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,677
Mike, why are you here?

1555
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,941
'Cause I love you, Jen.

1556
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,243
All right, I
love you so much.

1557
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,443
I can't get you
outta my life.

1558
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,041
I need you.

1559
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:30,948
Hey, hey.

1560
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,543
You're scaring me.

1561
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,589
I don't know any
other way to say this,

1562
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,317
but I never want to
see you again.

1563
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,255
Why am I scaring you Jen,

1564
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,486
I just want to get
you back in my life.

1565
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:39,151
That's all.

1566
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:41,991
Okay, we're never getting
back together again, okay.

1567
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,087
It's over.

1568
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,097
I never want to
see you again.

1569
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,827
I don't want to be
friends, you know,

1570
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,095
I don't want anymore
of your visits.

1571
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,727
I don't want
shit from you!

1572
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,966
So please, leave me alone
and get on with your life.

1573
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,166
- Jen...
- It's over.

1574
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,367
What happened Jen, what?

1575
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:55,409
What did you do
to her, Michael!

1576
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
He didn't do anything.

1577
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:57,943
No, what are you
doing here, Mike,

1578
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,344
why are you
upsetting my sister?

1579
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,915
I'm not trying to upset
your sister, Top cat.

1580
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,109
I'm just trying to
get back in my life,

1581
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:02,809
that's all.

1582
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,977
She doesn't want to get
back together with you.

1583
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,577
She told you that already.

1584
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,089
isten to me, I don't want
to see you aroun d here again.

1585
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,886
Or I'm going to have to do
something you don't like.

1586
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,392
What are you going
to do Top cat,

1587
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,393
you're 1 9 years old.

1588
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,520
You're 1 9!

1589
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,598
Don't be stupid!

1590
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,597
Listen to me,
don't you be stupid

1591
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,564
and make Top cat angry.

1592
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,156
Watch your hands.

1593
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:19,825
Angry?

1594
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,959
What about my
level of anger!

1595
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,231
Is anybody here concerned
about how angry I am!

1596
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,603
All right, I'm going
to give you 3 seconds.

1597
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,699
Get in your truck and go.

1598
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,368
One.

1599
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,877
Two.

1600
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,674
Dick.

1601
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,806
Ugh!

1602
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,383
Oh, you asshole!

1603
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:36,178
You hit me!

1604
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:36,717
Yeah.

1605
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:37,877
I told you to get
out of here, man.

1606
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,818
So you hit me when I
wasn't paying attention.

1607
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,549
Yes, and I'm going
to hit you again

1608
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,750
unless you get in
the truck and go.

1609
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,191
You've changed, Top cat.

1610
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,968
Hey, Jen, I got
news for you,

1611
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,439
you'll never find a guy like
me again as long as you live.

1612
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,942
I'm a good guy, Jen.

1613
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:02,942
And you blew it.

1614
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,747
How'd it go, son?

1615
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,283
Not so good, Pop.

1616
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,522
All right, why don't you
go into the living room,

1617
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,860
lie down, put
on the Met game,

1618
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,560
I'll make us a
meatloaf, how's that?

1619
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:27,897
That sounds
really good, Pop.

1620
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:39,211
Hey babe, the
crib is done.

1621
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,215
And it looks terrific.

1622
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,877
Good.

1623
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,819
Do you think you'll finish
painting her room tomorrow?

1624
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,321
can't the painting
wait a week?

1625
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:51,154
I mean, we're getting
married this weekend, babe.

1626
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,818
I don't want it to wait.

1627
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,953
Why does it need
to be tomorrow?

1628
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,929
Because her
room being done,

1629
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,294
makes thin gs
feel real to me.

1630
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,958
It's important.

1631
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,127
So waiting until
after the weekend

1632
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,602
is going to make
it feel less real?

1633
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,468
Yes.

1634
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,165
We said we'd have it
done by the wedding.

1635
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,004
I'm gonna get a beer.

1636
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,082
Tc?

1637
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,454
Jimbo, this
isn't good, man.

1638
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,152
What's up, man, I thought
you left hours ago.

1639
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,251
This isn't good.

1640
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,295
No, this is good.

1641
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,421
And it's none of your
fuckin' business.

1642
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,399
Miss, look, just
go back, okay.

1643
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,991
He's a happily
married man.

1644
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:34,831
Shut the fuck up.

1645
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:35,926
We're going for a drink.

1646
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,062
We're just goin g
for a fuckin' drink.

1647
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:37,901
Look you...

1648
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,872
Shut the fuck up, Tc!

1649
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,704
isten, you know
Jimbo, I'll just...

1650
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,243
Chrystal, come on,
don't listen to him.

1651
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,710
we're just goin g
for a drink.

1652
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,371
et her get inside, let
her go inside, she's fine.

1653
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,609
God damn it, what the
fuck are you doin g, man!

1654
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,513
Let her go, okay.

1655
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:50,846
What the fuck
are you doin g!

1656
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,511
Think about this,
just think about it.

1657
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:53,451
Think about your wife.

1658
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:55,319
Think about how it will ruin
your whole fuckin' marriage.

1659
01:09:55,424 --> 01:10:01,488
My fuckin' marriage
is shit anyway!

1660
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,428
My marriage is fucked man!

1661
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:04,965
Yoou want to know what's
fuckin' wron g with me?

1662
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:05,931
You want to know
what's fuckin' wrong,

1663
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,229
is that what it is?

1664
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,098
Huh?

1665
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,136
Is that what my
wife wants to know?

1666
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,035
Did she send you?

1667
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,629
She didn't send me.

1668
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,367
Is that what my fuckin'
brother wants to know

1669
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,500
and his perfect
little fuckin' wife?

1670
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,135
What's wrong with
Jimbo, is that it?

1671
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,544
Just relax, sit
down right here,

1672
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,081
I'm gonna get
some coffee.

1673
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,048
I don't want fuckin'
coffee, all right!

1674
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,312
Look it's all
gonna work out.

1675
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,411
It's not gonna work
out, it's fucked,

1676
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,682
you know why?

1677
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,090
Why?

1678
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,354
You know why
Julianna hates me?

1679
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,223
She doesn't hate you.

1680
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,819
She should, and
you know why?

1681
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,468
I can't have kids man.

1682
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,631
What do you mean,
you can't have kids?

1683
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:50,805
She wants babies,
she wants babies,

1684
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,403
and for a year we
were fucking trying.

1685
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,016
And it wasn't
happenin', man.

1686
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:57,949
So a couple of
months ago,

1687
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,783
I went to the doctor and
he told me I had some

1688
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:04,985
hypothalamic pituitary, shit...

1689
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,222
sperm shit...

1690
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,662
I'm totally and
completely infertile man.

1691
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,425
Man, I'm sorry.

1692
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,364
No chance of havin' a kid.

1693
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:13,833
I didn't know...

1694
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,096
I can't have a kid,
you think she's going

1695
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,865
to fuckin' stay with me
if I can't have a kid.

1696
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:17,666
She's going to
understand...

1697
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,707
No she's not going to
fuckin' understand.

1698
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:22,208
Paulie's going
to have a kid.

1699
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,039
Paulie's going
to have a kid,

1700
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,773
my little brother he's
going to have a kid.

1701
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,678
That's what a
fuckin' man is.

1702
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,614
Someone who
can have a kid.

1703
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,121
My little brother's going to
have a fuckin' kid and I can't.

1704
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,020
I can't even be
his best man,

1705
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,491
what the fuck.

1706
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,721
He was my best man!

1707
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,854
He was my best man!

1708
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,942
Hey Sue, I'm thinkin'
about going to Dez's

1709
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:58,013
for a couple of beers
tonight, if that's all right?

1710
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,581
It's almost midnight.

1711
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:04,449
Actually, it's only 1 1 1 5.

1712
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:07,420
Actually, that's not the point.

1713
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,081
Paulie, the point
is, is that I'm pregnant

1714
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:09,953
and I'm gettin' scared

1715
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,924
because and you're
so off in your own shit

1716
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,495
an d your own feelin gs
an d here I am,

1717
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,531
just sittin g here waitin g
for you to take care of me.

1718
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:22,730
Sue, look, I mean I think
you're kind of over reacting...

1719
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,066
I mean I did take
care of the crib today.

1720
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,435
All right, I did
finish the crib.

1721
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:26,701
Over-reacting?

1722
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,744
It's been months, since
you've given me flowers.

1723
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,109
How about a little
romance, Paulie?

1724
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,580
You know what would
be nice, occasionally,

1725
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,877
breakfast in bed.

1726
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,112
Or-or...

1727
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,951
better yet, how
about a foot massage?

1728
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,651
Do you know-do you
know what it's like.

1729
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,193
to be on your feet all day,

1730
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,592
five an d a half
months pregnant,

1731
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,027
planning a wedding
that your fiancee

1732
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,099
has absolutely no interest in,

1733
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,792
And working your ass off?

1734
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,801
You know what,
Sue, I mean look,

1735
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,701
I don't see you making
me breakfast in bed.

1736
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:00,798
You are not fucking
pregnant, Paulie!

1737
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,434
And I have to do everything!

1738
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,910
And when you actually
do contribute,

1739
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:06,037
it's like pulling teeth.

1740
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,241
ike the God damn
crib for example.

1741
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,011
'cause I'm not under
any pressure, right?

1742
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,017
I'm runnin' around all week

1743
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,280
trying to keep everybody happy.

1744
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,116
But that's nothin'.

1745
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,280
What about my happiness?

1746
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,584
Oh, please, Sue, look.

1747
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,922
I-I don't mean to
sound unsympathetic.

1748
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,892
But why does it always
have to come back to you?

1749
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:21,928
Why?

1750
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,088
Paulie, I'm so sorry.

1751
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,031
You have so many
outings to plan.

1752
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,366
The softball games,
and the fishing trips,

1753
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,733
and the golf outings.

1754
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,136
Your stupid fuckin' band.

1755
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,435
You know what,
that's a lot.

1756
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,474
You know what, fine.

1757
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,668
I'll just stay home, okay?

1758
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:40,579
No, it's not about that.

1759
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:44,015
I miss my friend.

1760
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,485
I just want my friend back.

1761
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,352
And I don't even
know if you want this,

1762
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,652
if you want me?

1763
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,957
If you want this
baby or any of this,

1764
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,257
this whole life.

1765
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:20,680
What?

1766
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,585
Hey, it's me, Tc.

1767
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,418
Look, I need a favor.

1768
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,958
Well, then you called
the wrong guy, Tc!

1769
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,459
Oh, come on, I don't
need this right now.

1770
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,927
I got Jimbo right
here passed out.

1771
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,055
He's in a bad way, he's
been drinking all day.

1772
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,099
I just don't want
to bring him home.

1773
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,566
Did you call Paulie?

1774
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,296
Paulie doesn't need to deal
with this shit, right now.

1775
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:35,961
Paulie!

1776
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,164
Come on, relax.

1777
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,297
All right, bring him over here.

1778
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,876
But listen, Tc, listen
real close, okay?

1779
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,583
Such an ass, man.

1780
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,679
Un, dues, tres, quatorze.

1781
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,030
Shut the Hell
up, that's awful!

1782
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,603
I know it sounds awful!

1783
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:10,763
That's why I'm practicing!

1784
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,343
What the Hell is this?

1785
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,809
It's Jimbo, Dad, he's all drunk.

1786
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,005
You're a pack of idiots.

1787
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,309
What did we do?

1788
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,077
We're helpin' him out.

1789
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,413
We got to get him some coffee.

1790
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,145
What is this?

1791
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,482
It's "Little House on the Prairie."

1792
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,384
Get him on the couch.

1793
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,353
How'd this happen?

1794
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,617
How'd this happen, practice.

1795
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:30,487
How else does it happen?

1796
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,115
He's a drunk!

1797
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,284
I'll talk to him in morning.

1798
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,157
Son of a bitches, waking me
up the middle of the night.

1799
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,026
You were up anyway,
watchin' porno.

1800
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,325
What are you
arguing about?

1801
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:41,630
Jimbo, cover yourself up.

1802
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:45,036
Jimbo, look... hey!

1803
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:52,273
Daddy, I was joking!

1804
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,042
You got to be fuckin' kidding me.

1805
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,845
You said, "don't see you
making me breakfast in bed."

1806
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,886
Well, she was screaming
her head off at me.

1807
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,352
You know, like
a crazy woman.

1808
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,446
She's pregnant, she's
allowed to scream at you.

1809
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,388
All the time?

1810
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,551
Yeah, It's
called hormones.

1811
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,994
Look, I know I'm supposed to
be excited for the wedding,

1812
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,759
and for the most part I am.

1813
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:12,856
The thing that
scares me

1814
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,596
are those moments
when I'm not excited.

1815
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:18,673
Like, tonight for
example, you know?

1816
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,674
can I just say, I think
you're blowing it?

1817
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,175
I mean, that's just her,
she's looking for something.

1818
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,266
She's asking for help.

1819
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,369
And you're sitting
here at this bar.

1820
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,777
What are you doing?

1821
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:27,974
You know what it is, Dez?

1822
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,916
It's like... a
wedding is one thing...

1823
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,146
There's all the insanity
that goes around that,

1824
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,689
and preparing for that.

1825
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,782
And everyone gets nervous
before they get married.

1826
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:42,091
But... you know, we got a kid
coming in a couple of months.

1827
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:46,133
A kid that we didn't plan for.

1828
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,792
And I guess I'm just...

1829
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:50,098
I don't know if I'm...
If I can be a good dad.

1830
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,867
You know, I don't know if I can do it.

1831
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,567
et me paint you this
little scenario, okay?

1832
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,610
Sue gets done
with your indecision.

1833
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:57,736
All right, she can't
deal with it anymore,

1834
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,040
you guys break up.

1835
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,513
And say down the road, like
three years down the road,

1836
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,414
she meets this guy
and he's a great guy.

1837
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,076
And he's not a coward.

1838
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,146
And there's some night
you'll have visitation rights.

1839
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,952
And this guy- this guy

1840
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,720
he's reading
stories to your kid.

1841
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,661
He is tucking
your kid into bed.

1842
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,925
This other man is
loving your kid.

1843
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,900
And at some point your,
you know, your boy

1844
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,665
or your girl is going to
start calling this guy Daddy.

1845
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:26,104
Fuck, I'm not sayin g I want
some other guy raise my kid.

1846
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,607
I'm just saying...

1847
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:31,941
ook, I love Sue an d
I want the baby I'm just...

1848
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,015
Then there's no problem.

1849
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,378
All right, listen,
there's no problem.

1850
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,416
Go home.

1851
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:49,127
Thank you, Desmond.

1852
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,096
My gosh.

1853
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,259
He's out like a
light in there.

1854
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,836
Where did you guys go?

1855
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:57,871
He took me someplace
call the F oxy Hunt,

1856
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:58,940
something like that.

1857
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,303
Apparently he's a
platinum member too.

1858
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,808
Yeah, tell me about it.

1859
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,104
Son, you don't
go there, do you?

1860
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,303
No, Pop, I would
never go there.

1861
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,506
- Good.
- Not Mikey.

1862
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,913
All right, boys,
that's it for me.

1863
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,109
You'll clean up,
won't you, son?

1864
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,480
Yes, Pop.

1865
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:12,610
Good to see you, Tony.

1866
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,586
Yeah, good to see
you, Mister Sullivan.

1867
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,180
My boy will forgive
you eventually.

1868
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,316
He gets that stubborn
streak from his mother.

1869
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,725
But she always
came around too.

1870
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,421
- I love you, Pop.
- Love you too.

1871
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:28,128
- Good night.
- Good night.

1872
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,295
et me ask you a
question about bein g gay.

1873
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,429
Off the record, all right?

1874
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,700
- Uh-huh.
- Off the record.

1875
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:33,467
Fine, fine.

1876
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:34,405
Off the record.

1877
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:38,240
Dating, that's got to
be kinda weird, right?

1878
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,836
Mikey, what are
you getting at?

1879
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:43,816
Okay, it's got to be easier
to date if your gay, right,

1880
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,649
because with girls it's, you
got to know what she likes,

1881
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:47,312
an d it's a whole deal.

1882
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:48,946
But with guys, guys
are horny all the time,

1883
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,319
you just meet two
guys and boom.

1884
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,484
Actually it would just
be easier that way.

1885
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,721
It's the same thing, man,
you want to meet somebody,

1886
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,061
just hook up, get your
leather stretched, whatever.

1887
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,030
That's easy, man.

1888
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,568
But if you want to meet
somebody and make it special,

1889
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,297
make it count, that's
tough too, man.

1890
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,236
That's always tough,
no matter what you are.

1891
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,365
You know what I mean?

1892
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,807
I probably should have
thought this through

1893
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,935
before we got into
all the particulars.

1894
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:11,705
You asked.

1895
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:12,472
I know I asked.

1896
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,345
It's just...

1897
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,849
I'm just trying
to be honest, man.

1898
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:20,646
Uncle Liam.

1899
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,341
Morning, James.

1900
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,576
You feeling the pain?

1901
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:24,777
Oh, yeah.

1902
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,855
I hit it pretty
hard last night.

1903
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,287
How did I get here?

1904
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,450
Tc brought you over last night.

1905
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,959
You passed out.

1906
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:34,289
But don't worry,
we called Julianna.

1907
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,092
she knows you're here.

1908
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,895
Pops, did I do
anything really stupid?

1909
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:45,234
come on inside, I'll
make you breakfast.

1910
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,793
Good morning.

1911
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,201
Morning.

1912
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,940
Hmm.

1913
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,877
Flowers.

1914
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,315
Breakfast.

1915
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,978
What is missing
in this picture?

1916
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,783
What could possibly
be missing?

1917
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,016
A foot massage.

1918
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,791
You did really good, Paulie.

1919
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,095
I like the bedroom.

1920
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,897
It's beautiful.

1921
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:50,232
Thank you.

1922
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:54,532
So you two have kissed
and made up, huh?

1923
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,440
Yeah, we made up, but
there's no kissin' goin' on.

1924
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,444
- Not yet.
- You're not my type.

1925
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,535
You think Jimbo knows?

1926
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:00,444
Not a chance.

1927
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,480
Knows what?

1928
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,346
How about you, Pops,
you know my secret?

1929
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:04,748
I'm old, I'm not stupid.

1930
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,377
What secret?

1931
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,888
Guess.

1932
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,585
Man, I'm way to fuckin' hung
over to guess anything, what?

1933
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:18,030
Check it out, right, TC is gay.

1934
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,122
Bullshit.

1935
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,429
That's right, I got a
boyfriend to prove it.

1936
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,594
He's got a boyfriend.

1937
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:29,536
Good for you.

1938
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,646
Yeah.

1939
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,242
Jesus christ, Pop!

1940
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:39,411
I can see your feet!

1941
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,726
Paulie, hey listen...

1942
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,595
Before you say anything,

1943
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:56,034
I know I've-I've been a
prick all week and ahh...

1944
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,901
Can we talk?

1945
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:00,702
It's pretty important.

1946
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,136
I didn't know how
to deal with it.

1947
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,406
I still don't know if
I can deal with it.

1948
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,879
You two can still
have kids, Jim.

1949
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:08,847
You two can adopt.

1950
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,645
Oh, God, come on, that's
what the Doctor said.

1951
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:11,810
It's such bullshit, Paul.

1952
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,080
It's not the same
thing and you know it.

1953
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,917
It is the same thing.

1954
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,821
Any asshole can get
a girl pregnant, all right?

1955
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,154
That doesn't take any talent.

1956
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,821
But to be a dad,
to be a good dad.

1957
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:26,799
Doesn't seem to be too
many guys that can do that.

1958
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:28,061
When I found out you
two were having a kid,

1959
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,636
I just snapped.

1960
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,434
I did, I mean, you're my
younger brother, okay?

1961
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,407
An d you had your world together
an d my life's fallin g apart.

1962
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,273
It's not supposed to be that way.

1963
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,108
you were the punk kid
who was trying to hang out

1964
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,181
with me and my friends.

1965
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:42,545
Yeah, you liked it
better when you could

1966
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,242
beat the shit out
of me everyday, huh?

1967
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,980
Yeah.

1968
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,148
Yeah, I liked that a lot.

1969
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:53,625
Seriously, umm...

1970
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,925
I know I've been tough the last
couple of months to deal with.

1971
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:00,433
I'm sorry.

1972
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,832
Can you forgive me?

1973
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,666
Of course, man, come
on, you're my brother.

1974
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:10,643
Just talk to me next time,
don't let it get weird like this.

1975
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,771
What about Julianna, you know?

1976
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,975
I can't...

1977
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:19,247
This shit is so hard for
me, this emotional stuff.

1978
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,288
You just got to tell her
as straight as you can.

1979
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,324
Just be honest.

1980
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,452
I can't call her,
send her e-mail.

1981
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,052
Can you do it for me?

1982
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,930
Look man, you're
gonna be fine.

1983
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,865
Just tell her the
same way you told me.

1984
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,266
She's gonna to leave me.

1985
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,134
She's not gonna leave
you, she loves you.

1986
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,139
Why?

1987
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,312
A year from now, you're
going to adopt a kid

1988
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,677
and you're going to have a
big fat smile on your face.

1989
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,579
My chinese and
Romanian kids can play

1990
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:51,777
with your kid.

1991
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,672
Well, is everything all right?

1992
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,974
The guys called
me last night

1993
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,275
in the middle of the
night and I woke up,

1994
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,474
what the Hell is
wrong with you?

1995
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,518
Listen.

1996
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,746
There's something I got to
talk to you about, okay?

1997
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:28,652
Okay.

1998
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:36,526
Okay, I know I've been really
hard to be around for awhile.

1999
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:43,059
Don't think I'm not
aware of that, okay?

2000
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:44,035
But there's a reason,

2001
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,334
it isn't just things
were bad at work...

2002
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:58,409
A couple of months ago
I went to see a doctor, right?

2003
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,081
It's okay, baby, what's wrong?

2004
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:05,591
Okay, you're scaring me.

2005
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,490
They did some tests.

2006
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:12,364
He told me I
can't have kids.

2007
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:17,704
I knew how bad
you wanted them.

2008
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:22,640
I thought you were
gonna leave me.

2009
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,177
You can't leave me.

2010
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,372
It's okay.

2011
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,473
I was so worried.

2012
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:35,420
If you need to leave
me, I understand.

2013
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,354
I just want you
to be okay.

2014
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,935
Tc, you got to go,
it's your Father.

2015
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:54,940
It's the right
thing to do.

2016
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,874
I don't think it's a
good idea, I just don't.

2017
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:57,467
It is.

2018
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:58,204
He's your father.

2019
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,780
If I can take it,
he can take it.

2020
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,746
He loves you more
than anybody on Earth.

2021
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,009
You're his son.

2022
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:06,018
Go ahead. Good luck.

2023
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,109
All right, thanks.

2024
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,524
Sure you don't
want me to stay?

2025
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:22,763
No, I'm good. Thanks, man.

2026
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:36,773
Gay pride, woo hoo!

2027
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,181
Dad?

2028
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,083
Dad?

2029
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,560
Dad, it's me, Tc.

2030
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,196
Look...

2031
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,382
Perdóneme.

2032
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:23,021
Perdóneme.

2033
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,029
You look great, man.

2034
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,429
Oh, I feel like crap.

2035
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,099
I don't know, man.

2036
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,111
come on, you know
you need to do this.

2037
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,077
Why do I need to do it?

2038
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:41,808
That's stupid that
I need to do this.

2039
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,110
Come on, don't be a can dy ass,

2040
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:45,082
You know what you
need to do, do it.

2041
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:46,278
Look, he probably
didn't mean it.

2042
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:47,615
He was probably just
caught up in the moment.

2043
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:48,916
et's not make a whole
big thin g out of it.

2044
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,718
For Christ's sake, why
don't you go by an d hug him?

2045
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:53,589
You wonder why your
kids are juvenile delinquents.

2046
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:55,686
Mike, he's not a good
guy, go get your revenge.

2047
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,924
What she says.

2048
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,465
She'll say anything you say.

2049
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:00,465
Look what she does.

2050
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:01,728
That's not true.

2051
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:02,803
I have my own mind.

2052
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:04,235
All right, come on, hurry up.

2053
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:35,761
Top cat!

2054
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,764
That's disgusting.

2055
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,435
Really, really disgusting.

2056
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,058
Hey, Sue!

2057
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:01,992
Sue, you home?

2058
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:02,619
Yeah.

2059
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,927
Hey, come on.

2060
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:08,228
I got a surprise for you.

2061
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:09,769
You didn't need
to do this, Paulie.

2062
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,772
This is beautiful, but...

2063
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,000
unnecessary.

2064
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:18,204
Yeah, well I absolutely
had to do this.

2065
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:19,006
All right, give me...

2066
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,045
Give me your
engagement ring.

2067
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:21,172
- What?
- Give me your ring.

2068
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:37,627
All right Sue, I know for
the last couple of weeks...

2069
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,029
Maybe even the last
couple of months,

2070
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,896
I haven't been the man
I'd promised you I'd be

2071
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:43,129
when I first did this,

2072
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:46,570
PBut I want you to know
from this moment forward

2073
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,665
you have me fully, all right?

2074
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,712
As your friend,
and as your husband,

2075
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:55,146
And as the father to our baby.

2076
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,580
And you know I want
that baby, Sue.

2077
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:59,050
You know that, right?

2078
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:01,485
Yes.

2079
