00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
<i><b><font color="#00ffff">This Movie is from FAIZAN's Collection</font></b></i>

2
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,476
Yo.

3
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,702
Hey, I was doing some research
for next year...

4
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,814
...and I think I figured out
which website I wanna subscribe to.

5
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:59,042
- The Vag-tastic Voyage.
- Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?

6
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,015
<i>The Vag-tastic Voyage
is the one where...</i>

7
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>... they find random girls on the street,
and they invite them into a van...</i>

8
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,488
...and then they bang them
in the van.

9
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,955
It's like 13 bucks a month...

10
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,822
...and you get access
to other sites.

11
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,330
Like one's Latina, one's Asian,
you know, there's one for fetishes...

12
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,025
...like feet and pee-pee and shit
and stuff like that.

13
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,000
That's disgusting.
You're like an animal.

14
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,674
I'm... What? I'm disgusting?
You're the weird one, man.

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,843
Don't make me feel weird
because I like porn.

16
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,342
You're weird for not liking porn.
I'm normal as shit.

17
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,309
Peeing on people. That's normal?

18
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,847
Evan, I'm not saying
I'm gonna look at it.

19
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,417
I'm just saying that
it comes with the site, okay?

20
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,986
I don't know what I'm gonna be into
10 years from now.

21
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,884
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.

22
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,254
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar,
I want a little production value.

23
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,191
Like some editing, transition,
something. Some music.

24
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,232
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers
don't direct the porn that I watch.

25
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,993
They're hard to get ahold of, okay?

26
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,036
Plus your parents are gonna be
looking at the bill, dipshit.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,643
Yeah, you're right. I probably should
pick the one with the least dirty name.

28
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,939
What about, like, Perfect Ten?

29
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,946
Something like that, you know?

30
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,709
Like Perfect Ten?

31
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,750
Because that could be
any number of things.

32
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,321
They can't really get you for that.
That could be, like, a bowling website.

33
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,551
Yeah, but they don't really show dick
going in, which is a huge concern.

34
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,729
I didn't realize that.

35
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,490
Plus, have you ever seen
a vagina by itself?

36
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,096
Not for me.

37
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,735
Hi.

38
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,732
- Thanks for taking him, Seth.
- No... No problem, Jane.

39
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,171
- How are you?
- Good.

40
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,969
Beautiful.

41
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,573
- Don't touch that.
- What are you...?

42
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,874
- I'm not a piece of meat.
- You two are funny.

43
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,847
I can't imagine what you're gonna do
without each other next year.

44
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,079
Evan told me
you didn't get into Dartmouth.

45
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,951
I got into some schools, some
pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

46
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,153
- You gonna miss each other?
- No. Miss each other? No, thank you.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,922
I don't... I don't miss each other.

48
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,930
I'm gonna cry myself
to sleep every night.

49
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,693
- Me too.
- When I'm out partying.

50
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,495
Go to school, boys.

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,666
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Jane.

52
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,708
I am truly jealous you got to suck
on those tits when you were a baby.

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,815
Yeah, well, at least you got to
suck on your dad's dick.

54
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,155
Hey, Seth,
you can't park in the faculty lot.

55
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,266
Don't be such a vagine, man.
I gotta get a Red Bull before class.

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,427
You're being an idiot.
You shouldn't have parked there.

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,163
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.

58
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,138
They should be sucking
on my ball sac.

59
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,072
It's the least they could do
for stealing three years of my life.

60
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,745
- Oh, fuck me.
- Look at those nipples.

61
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,888
They're like little baby toes.

62
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,149
It's not fair
they get to flaunt that stuff...

63
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,452
...and I have to hide
every erection I get.

64
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,289
You know what I do?
I flip my boner up into my waistband.

65
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,488
It hides it and it feels awesome.

66
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,133
I almost blew a load
into my bellybutton.

67
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,304
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't
weirded out by our boners...

68
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,166
...and just, like,
wanted to see them.

69
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,468
I mean, that's the world
I one day wanna live in.

70
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,805
It's been two years since I've seen
an actual human female nipple.

71
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,982
Shauna?
Shauna was two years ago now?

72
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,150
Yeah.

73
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,784
Yeah, I guess so.
But she was insanely hot.

74
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,183
Exactly. She was too hot, okay?
That's what sucks.

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,654
How can that suck?
I'd be psyched if I got with her.

76
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,349
You got, like, two dozen handjobs.

77
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,257
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob,
but who's counting?

78
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,556
Look, it was the peak
of my ass-getting career...

79
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,324
...and it happened way too early.

80
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,468
- You're like Orson Welles.
- Exactly!

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,161
If I'd paced myself,
I'd be having at least steady sex...

82
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,669
...with a decent-looking girl.

83
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,843
I honestly see now why Orson Welles
ate his fat ass to death.

84
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,841
You'll have sex in college,
everyone does.

85
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,140
But the point is to be good at sex
by the time you get to college.

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,182
You don't want girls thinking
you suck dick at fucking pussy.

87
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,353
I still think you have
a chance with Jules.

88
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,351
She got incredibly hot over
last summer...

89
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,524
...and she obviously
hasn't realized it yet...

90
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,387
...because she's still talking to you
and flirting with you.

91
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,621
Are you out of your mind?
Look at Jules' dating record, okay?

92
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,164
She dated Dan Remick, who's had
a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.

93
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,929
Jason Stone, who looks like
fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.

94
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,402
Matt Muir.
He's the sweetest guy ever.

95
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,439
Have you ever stared into his eyes?

96
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,203
It was like the first time
I heard the Beatles.

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,473
Why would she end
her high school career with me?

98
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,707
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz
for like two years.

99
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,217
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot.
You're a step up from that dick-load.

100
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,514
That's why you need to stop...
Will you get this?

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,124
That's why you need to stop
being a pussy and nail her.

102
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,089
You could bang her
before you leave.

103
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,230
And I'm not gonna dance around it,
she looks like a good fucker.

104
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,831
I'm tired of you talking
about her like that, man.

105
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,492
What, you can talk about her all day
and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?

106
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,262
Well, I don't constantly insult her.

107
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,872
I'm not trying to insult her.

108
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,599
I'm just saying that
she looks like a good fucker, okay?

109
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,334
She looks like she can take a dick.

110
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,105
Some women pride themselves
on their dick-taking abilities.

111
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,216
Dick-taking abilities? You think
that's good to say about someone?

112
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,613
The fucked-up thing is,
I actually do, okay?

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,415
If a woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

114
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,989
Hey, yo, Seth.

115
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,228
What?

116
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,455
Did you hear I'm having
a big grad party next Saturday?

117
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,834
- No.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,403
- Oh, shit!
- You're not coming.

119
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,304
Tell your fucking faggot friend
he can't come either.

120
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,643
So Jesse wanted me to tell you...

121
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,215
...you're a fucking faggot
and can't come to his party.

122
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,284
You really bitched out
back there, man.

123
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,818
I bitched out?

124
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,786
You bitched out, man,
you fucking Judas.

125
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,186
You fucking left me hanging.

126
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,384
Did you want me to dive
in front of his spit?

127
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,525
Come on, guys, let's go!

128
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,039
This is bullshit.

129
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,377
Pussy.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,549
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

131
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:16,320
...then I squared equals
negative one. Okay?

132
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,759
In other words,
if you consider I as a constant...

133
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,731
...you can then define the square roots
of all the negative numbers.

134
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,606
So I is an imaginary number.
It doesn't really exist.

135
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,867
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

136
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,068
...then I squared equals
negative one.

137
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,941
Is this making s...? Okay.

138
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,852
- Okay, bye.
- Evan!

139
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,858
- Evan, hey.
- Hey, Becca.

140
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,651
- Hey, thank you for your pen.
- Hey.

141
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,489
No problem. No, no, don't worry.
No worries. You keep it.

142
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,258
You won't have to borrow one again
because you'll have that one.

143
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,335
<i>- Thank you so much, that's...
- You're welcome. Don't worry about it.</i>

144
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,165
So I was gonna ask you...

145
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,864
...did you hear about
Jesse's grad party next weekend?

146
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,637
- It should be fun.
- I heard. L... It's a maybe.

147
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,336
- Really?
- For me at the moment.

148
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,076
- My R.S.V.P.
- Just a maybe?

149
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,250
So far.

150
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,113
There's so much other fun shit
that's gonna be happening...

151
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,346
...that I can't really commit and,
you know, hurt someone's feelings.

152
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,617
Fun shit? But I never see you
at parties or anything.

153
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,292
That's because of
all the other fun shit I'm off doing.

154
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,226
<i>I'd love to be at all of them, but...</i>

155
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,264
Why weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

156
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,958
There was so many things
going on.

157
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,263
I couldn't find a minute
to make an appearance.

158
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,908
- What did you do?
- Saturday was a crazy night for me.

159
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,912
<i>I had some friends over,
we had a few drinks.</i>

160
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,945
<i>That's Vag-tastic!</i>

161
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,879
<i>I hung out in my basement,
the chill zone, where we chill-lax.</i>

162
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,714
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"
all at once.</i>

163
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,313
Seth's parents
were throwing a party.

164
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,459
<i>We got to hang around adults,
which was a nice change of pace.</i>

165
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,097
<i>You converse, you talk to people
and they have interesting stories.</i>

166
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,961
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had
climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

167
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,600
Then we went to a nightclub, which
was incredible. This big, fancy one.

168
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,569
<i>- Gonna look at tits right now!
- I'm feeling crazy. I said that.</i>

169
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,240
<i>- You got in?
- We got right in.</i>

170
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,241
- Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
- Fuck you!

171
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,813
<i>Then we called it a night.
We were all just really exhausted.</i>

172
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,779
What the fuck?!

173
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,216
You would've loved it. It was
an incredible, unbelievable night.

174
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,719
That sounds like a lot of fun.

175
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,824
You know, I'd love to go
do something like that sometime.

176
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,653
Who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...

177
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,059
...me and Seth are
always kind of cooking up these...

178
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,893
...fun, sort of,
little, you know, events.

179
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,831
I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

180
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,767
We were going to,
but we got into different schools.

181
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,999
Really? That sucks.

182
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,435
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,204
Not too worried about it, really.

184
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,008
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried at all.

185
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:56,121
- All right, well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

186
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,189
- Bye.
- Bye.

187
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,656
Bye, Evan.

188
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,036
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class
because I'd be cooking with a partner.

189
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,801
But she's never here, and I don't get
twice the grades for doing all the work.

190
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,070
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,306
I know, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

192
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,974
Don't keep me waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

193
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,985
You know what I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

194
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,591
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone,
eating my terrible-tasting food...

195
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,260
...and I gotta look over at that.

196
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,656
Looks like the most fun
I've ever seen in my life.

197
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,992
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I wash and dry.

198
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,327
I'm like a single mother.

199
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,503
We all know Home Ec is a joke,
no offense.

200
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,105
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

201
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,243
I'm not putting down your profession,
but it's just the way I feel.

202
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,742
I don't wanna sit here alone
cooking this shitty food.

203
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,906
No offense. And I just think
that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

204
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,846
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

205
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,418
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

206
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,613
There's three weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

207
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,985
I'm sorry for cursing.

208
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,492
All right, Jules' partner isn't here
today either.

209
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,130
Pair up with her. Station four.

210
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,457
Jules?

211
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,532
All right. I'll give it another shot.

212
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,728
I'll give Home Ec another shot.

213
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,544
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

214
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,283
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

215
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,947
Nothing. It's my attempt at humor.
I was just...

216
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,953
Oh, like coming.

217
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,218
Like "coming" coming.

218
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,765
Wow, that was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

219
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,867
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that...

220
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,435
No, don't worry.
I'm actually used to it.

221
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,233
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

222
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,568
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

223
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,312
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I know.

224
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,480
I know.

225
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,241
I would've gone with something
at least mildly entertaining.

226
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,850
You know, like... Like...
Like "family Jules."

227
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,456
Or like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

228
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,859
Fucking funny.

229
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,429
- I can't believe that.
- So, all right. We gotta...

230
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,597
...mix it up.

231
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,836
Yeah, Hayworth will notice this,
if we cover it with chocolate.

232
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,331
- The whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

233
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,565
Okay.

234
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,243
- And now it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

235
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,880
- It's beautifully done.
- I think we're gonna get an A.

236
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,476
So, what are you doing tonight?

237
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,549
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't know.

238
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,746
My parents are gone
so I'm having a party.

239
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,551
I don't really know how many people
are gonna be there...

240
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,024
...but you could stop by
if you wanted to.

241
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,723
Yeah, I love parties.

242
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,757
Really?

243
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,466
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

244
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,365
You know, it's a love-hate thing.

245
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,905
So, like, you know, right now,
I really love them, though.

246
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,576
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

247
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,071
Yeah.

248
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,908
Hey, Miroki, could we have
a minute alone? Just... Thanks.

249
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,677
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

250
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,251
Hey!

251
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,919
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

252
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,451
I was just walking down the hall
and Nicola was right in front of me.

253
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,596
She's wearing these tight white pants
with this black G-string...

254
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,824
...and you could see right
through the pants. It was so sweet.

255
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,344
It's 10:33.

256
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,216
What?

257
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,548
I told her what time it was.

258
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,689
That's the coolest fucking story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

259
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,451
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

260
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,458
I'll miss your knee-slappers
when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

261
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,756
While you guys are at Dartmouth,
I'll be at State...

262
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,059
...where the girls are half as smart
and twice as likely to fellash me.

263
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,669
What are you guys doing tonight?
Asshole.

264
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,066
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

265
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,141
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
we can get shitfaced again, yeah?

266
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,073
You're always calling me a pussy,
but today you're wrong.

267
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,714
At lunch, I'm going to the same place
Mike Snider went...

268
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,282
...to pick up my brand-new fake ID.

269
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,588
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

270
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,223
That's insane. Evan was like,
"I heard about this party.

271
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,360
We shouldn't tell Fogell."
I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."

272
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,689
You could buy us booze now.
It's awesome.

273
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,355
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.

274
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,059
We're gonna party
and get crunk and rock out, dude.

275
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,329
If you're not in this class,
leave this class.

276
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,700
Fogell! Hi.

277
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,966
Okay. Gotta go.

278
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,167
Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

279
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,508
You tell that idiot
you're not rooming with him?

280
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,681
Not yet. No.

281
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,612
All right, well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

282
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,752
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

283
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,212
<i>We're getting a fake ID, so...</i>

284
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,187
- It's not like a big deal.
- Wow, that's cool.

285
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,519
But you guys have, like,
four more years to go...

286
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,127
...so do you wanna get to work?

287
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,696
<i>Well, we got into
different schools, so...</i>

288
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,992
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

289
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,761
Nothing. Jeez, what does
everybody think is gonna happen?

290
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,804
The world's gonna explode if we
don't spend every second together?

291
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,373
I mean, we're not dependent
on each other, you know.

292
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,976
We met when we were 8.
We were fine before then.

293
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,977
I was. I mean, it's like,
we don't do everything together.

294
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,877
No. All right, I gotta take a piss.

295
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,712
My dick's not gonna shake itself.
Come on, babe.

296
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,685
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

297
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,860
Well, at least
we're getting a graduation party.

298
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,189
Thank God, man.

299
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,263
I'm excited.

300
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,925
I would do terrible, disgusting things
to hook up with Jules.

301
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,900
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

302
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,233
I'd give my middle nut
to start dating Becca.

303
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,341
Becca's a bitch.

304
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,172
You know what? I'm seriously
getting fucking sick of you...

305
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,814
...talking about her like that,
if we can be honest.

306
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,643
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

307
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,251
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

308
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,748
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

309
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,425
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

310
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,424
When I was a little kid,
I kind of had this problem.

311
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,256
And it's not even that big of a deal.

312
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,194
<i>Something like 8 percent of kids
do it, but whatever. It's...</i>

313
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:54,829
For some reason, I don't know why,
I would just kind of sit around all day...

314
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,373
...and draw pictures of dicks.

315
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,504
What?

316
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,141
Draw pictures of dicks.

317
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,882
Dicks?

318
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,882
Like a man dick?

319
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,389
Yeah. Like a man dick.

320
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,457
<i>I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks.
I don't know what it was.</i>

321
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,428
<i>I couldn't touch the pen to paper
without drawing the shape of a penis.</i>

322
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,897
<i>- That's fucked.
- No shit, it's really fucked up.</i>

323
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,364
<i>Here I am, this little kid...</i>

324
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,505
<i>... and I can't stop drawing dicks
to save my own life.</i>

325
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,312
All right. I mean, I don't see
what this has to do with Becca.

326
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,884
Just listen. Okay?

327
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,251
<i>Your precious little Becca
sat next to me for all of fourth grade.</i>

328
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,587
<i>And in the classroom is where
I did the majority of my illustrations.</i>

329
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,626
<i>I was very secretive about this
whole dick operation I had going on.</i>

330
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,391
<i>Even I thought I was fucking crazy.</i>

331
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,262
<i>Imagine what everyone else
would think.</i>

332
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,438
<i>So I would stash
all of my dick drawings...</i>

333
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,506
<i>... in this Ghostbusters lunchbox
that I had.</i>

334
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,906
<i>So one day I'm finishing up this
real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.</i>

335
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,205
<i>All of a sudden...</i>

336
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,143
Pussy!

337
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,519
You hit Becca's foot with your dick?

338
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,450
Yeah. I know.

339
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:33,939
Oh, my God!

340
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,403
<i>She starts crying. She flips out.
And she rats me out to the principal.</i>

341
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,102
<i>He finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox
dick treasure chest...</i>

342
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,712
<i>... and he fucking flips out.</i>

343
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,560
<i>He calls in my parents. Turns out this
principal is some religious fanatic...</i>

344
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,922
<i>... and he thinks I'm possessed
by some dick devil.</i>

345
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,566
<i>My parents make me see a therapist,
and he's asking me dick questions.</i>

346
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,997
<i>They made me stop eating foods
shaped like dicks.</i>

347
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,830
<i>No hot dogs, no Popsicles.</i>

348
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,905
You know how many foods are
shaped like dicks? The best kinds.

349
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,541
Yeah.

350
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,278
Well, I don't...
That's really messed up.

351
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,308
- Super gay.
- All right, let's stop this madness.

352
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,747
- Let's just go get some dessert.
- I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.

353
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,251
I'm picking out my classes
for next year.

354
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,317
So I gotta sit and eat dessert alone,
like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?

355
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,461
I gue... Yeah, I mean,
what do you want me to do?

356
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,590
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.

357
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:39,033
- Just relax, man. I'll see you later.
- That's fine. I'll be fine.

358
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,313
Hey, pussy.

359
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,379
Fuck off.

360
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,278
Just the one. Just the one. Not both.

361
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,112
- So I'll call Andy and Greg.
- Okay.

362
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,788
And I'll bring the '80s dance music.

363
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,581
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right on.

364
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,225
Seth! Hi. There you are.
We were just talking about you.

365
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,622
- Here I am.
- That's weird.

366
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,559
So you're coming to my party tonight?
Because it's fully on.

367
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,826
<i>Yeah, why? Should I not come?
Because I could think of other shit...</i>

368
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,526
Oh, no. No.
I want you to come, I just...

369
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,969
You said something earlier about,
like, a fake ID or something, right?

370
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,735
Yeah, I'm gonna get one.
For sure, for sure.

371
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,674
I'm getting that for sure.

372
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,413
Can you get us booze?

373
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,184
Yeah. I can.
I can get you guys alcohol.

374
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,912
- Really? Seriously?
- Yes, for sure.

375
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,681
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

376
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,360
Because we were worried about that.
That would be great.

377
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,223
Plus, you know, you scratch
our backs, we'll scratch yours.

378
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,455
Well, Jules, the funny thing
about my back...

379
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,157
...is that it's located on my cock.

380
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,672
So you do want alcohol?
You want some or no?

381
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,068
You do or you don't?
You do want alcohol.

382
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,607
- Yeah.
- Either way.

383
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,802
- Well...
- Either way. Either way's fine.

384
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,742
This is actually kind of a big favor.

385
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,884
Because my parents left me like
100 bucks to feed myself for the week.

386
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,282
But the house is full of food,
so I just thought I'd spend it all...

387
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,287
<i>...on, you know,
extra drinks for the party, so...</i>

388
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,620
That's really nice. I don't think
I've ever done anything that nice.

389
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,353
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

390
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,724
- Okay. Thank you.
- Awesome.

391
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,901
I mean, seriously, that's really...
That's nice of you. Thank you.

392
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,730
So should I just get a shitload
of different shit?

393
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,871
Well, you gotta get me
some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.

394
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,306
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of
gay, but I can get it for you.

395
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,747
So... Okay, so then
we will see you tonight.

396
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,079
Go to the ball, guys.

397
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,011
Evan. Get into the game.

398
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,486
Kick it over to me.

399
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,747
Seth! Get off the field!

400
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,118
Get out of here.
They're gonna make me run laps.

401
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,520
Just fucking listen, okay?

402
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,186
Jules and her stupid fucking friend
asked me to buy her alcohol.

403
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,333
But not just her, for her whole party.
You know what that means?

404
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,698
By some miracle, we were paired up
and she actually thought of me.

405
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,601
Thought of me enough to decide
I was the guy she would trust...

406
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,605
...with the whole fun-ness of her party.
She wants to fuck me.

407
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,643
She wants my dick
in or around her mouth.

408
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,611
Did you think that maybe
she's using you to get her alcohol?

409
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,341
- She doesn't want your dick.
- Of course I thought of that.

410
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,544
The first thing that came
to my mind. Listen.

411
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,848
My older brother always says
the nastiest shit.

412
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,525
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

413
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,216
Seth, I wanna blow you.

414
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,357
She didn't say that. Come on.

415
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,395
She didn't say the second part,
the first...

416
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,999
She's got an older brother.
She could have asked him.

417
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,794
She looked me in the eyes and said:

418
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,734
"Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad.
I need some Seth's Own dressing."

419
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,307
She's D.T.F.
She's down to fuck, man.

420
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,172
P in vagi.
She wants to fuck, man.

421
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,041
Tonight is the night
that fucking is an actual possibility.

422
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,877
You sound like an idiot.
You're not gonna sleep with her.

423
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,350
No. Dude, I know
I talk a lot of shit, okay?

424
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,149
But she's gonna be at the party
and she's gonna be drunk.

425
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,759
She likes me at least a little.
At the very least, I'll make out with her.

426
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,953
Two weeks, handjob.
Month, blowjob. Whatever.

427
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,722
And then I make her my girlfriend.

428
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,900
And I've got, like,
two solid months of sex.

429
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,693
By the time college rolls around...

430
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,167
...l'll be like the Iron Chef
of pounding vag.

431
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,669
Can we talk about this later?

432
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,807
What the fuck, Evan?
We're down two points.

433
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,840
Fucking calm down, Greg.
It's soccer.

434
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,636
- It's soccer.
- Fuck you, man.

435
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,076
Hey, Greg, why don't you go
piss your pants again?

436
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,807
- That was eight years ago, asshole.
- People don't forget.

437
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,077
Do you wanna hear the best part?
Becca.

438
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,084
You do the same thing with her.

439
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,382
When you guys are shitfaced,
you get with her.

440
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,355
This is our last party
as high school people.

441
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,428
I've ignored my hatred for Becca
in coming up with this plan.

442
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,395
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking
come with me on this voyage...

443
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,158
...and stop being a pussy
for once...

444
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,395
...and we can fucking
fuck some girls already.

445
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,304
- I should buy Becca alcohol?
- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

446
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,375
That way you know she'll be drunk.
You know when girls say:

447
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,741
"I was so shitfaced last night.
I shouldn't have fucked that guy."

448
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,313
We could be that mistake!

449
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,880
Have you talked to Fogell?

450
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,987
All right, you talk to Becca.
I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.

451
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,156
Don't worry.

452
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,292
- Seth, get off the field!
- Goal.

453
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,223
- You're getting that!
- No, I'm not!

454
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,064
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

455
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,235
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

456
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,836
Hi. Did you hear
about the party tonight?

457
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,007
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds awesome.

458
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,175
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

459
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,707
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

460
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,469
That's why I came looking for you.

461
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,841
Me and the guys are gonna
go to a liquor store.

462
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,573
And I just thought, you know...

463
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:20,446
...if you needed someone
to get you yours, I could do that.

464
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,177
I could be that person.

465
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,616
Yeah.

466
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,313
Yeah, no, that would be great.

467
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,858
That would save me such a hassle,
because I was gonna beg my sister.

468
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,428
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

469
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,225
Yeah. That's the one
with the little golden flakes in it?

470
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,096
- Yeah. The girly one.
- That's classy.

471
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,032
Well, I'll pay you back at the party.

472
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,967
No, you won't.
No, it's my treat, miss.

473
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,436
- Really?
- Yep. That's that.

474
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,509
It's the first of many too,
so get used to it, sister.

475
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,907
Well, thank you.

476
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,945
Yeah, no problem.

477
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,153
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- It's okay.

478
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,953
I was gonna give you a nudge...
A punch, the friend thing.

479
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,185
I didn't mean...

480
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,829
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey.

481
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,055
- Hey.
- Gaby.

482
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,459
- What's up, Evan?
- Hey, Gaby.

483
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,498
- We should get to class.
- We're gonna go.

484
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,260
- So I will see you tonight.
- Okay.

485
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,029
- Really, don't worry.
- Okay. Sorry.

486
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,298
- Bye.
- Sorry.

487
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:16,839
Bye.

488
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,971
Sorry.

489
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,220
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell?
He said he'd be here.

490
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,856
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.

491
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,049
I did it, dude.
I even offered to pay for it.

492
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,125
It was pimp.
I feel like a pimp right now.

493
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,957
- Like one of those pimps.
- That is fucking pimp.

494
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:42,328
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Why didn't I think of that? Shit.

495
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:45,901
Sh... We're screwed.

496
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,367
- Okay? We're screwed.
- Okay.

497
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,598
This is what we get
for trusting Fogell, okay?

498
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,970
He pussied out.
I know he pussied out.

499
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:54,380
What are you making?

500
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:59,317
I'm just drilling holes.
The last two weeks. Fuck it.

501
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,277
What do we tell the girls,
we couldn't do the one thing...

502
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,649
...we promised because
we're dickless incompetents?

503
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,951
Now we're never gonna bone
because of that used tampon, Fogell.

504
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:11,858
How'd he get into Dartmouth?
I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.

505
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,964
All right,
how else can we get alcohol?

506
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,897
- Yo, guys! What's up?
- Fogell, where have you been, man?

507
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,968
You almost gave me
a goddamn heart attack.

508
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,369
- Let me see it. Did you pussy out?
- No, no, man. I got it.

509
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,634
It's flawless. Check it.

510
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,038
Hawaii?

511
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,873
All right, that's good.
It's hard to trace, I guess.

512
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,448
Wait, you changed your name
to McLovin?

513
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,283
- Yeah.
- McLovin?

514
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,449
What kind of a stupid name is that?
Are you an Irish R & B singer?

515
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,991
They let you pick any name you want
when you're there.

516
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:43,787
And you landed on McLovin?

517
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,157
Yeah, it was between that
or Mohammad.

518
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,526
Why the fuck would it be
between that or Mohammad?

519
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,725
Why not just pick
a common name?

520
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:54,065
Mohammad is the most common name
on earth. Read a fucking book.

521
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,070
Have you ever met anyone
named Mohammad?

522
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,072
Have you ever met anyone
named McLovin?

523
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,370
No, that's why you picked
a dumb fucking name.

524
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,842
- Fuck you.
- Give me that.

525
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,449
All right. You look like a future
pedophile in this picture, number one.

526
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,745
Number two, it doesn't even have
a first name. It just says McLovin!

527
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,047
What? One name?

528
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,816
One name? Who are you, Seal?

529
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,323
Fogell, this ID says
you're 25 years old.

530
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,086
Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?

531
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,321
Seth, Seth, Seth.
Listen up, ass-face.

532
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:23,024
Every day, hundreds of kids go into
the liquor store with their fake IDs...

533
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:25,033
...and every single one
says they're 21.

534
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:26,967
How many 21 -year-olds
are in this town?

535
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,572
It's called fucking strategy.

536
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,935
Let's stay calm, okay?
Let's not lose our heads.

537
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,271
It's a fine ID. It'll... It's gonna work.
It's passable, okay?

538
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,005
This isn't terrible.
I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.

539
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,741
This guy's gonna think,
"Here's a kid with a fake ID"...

540
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:44,184
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old
Hawaiian organ donor."

541
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,551
Okay? So, what's it gonna be?

542
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,583
I am McLovin.

543
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,257
No, you're not. No one's McLovin.
McLovin's never existed...

544
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,832
...because that's a made-up, dumb,
fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!

545
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,367
Jeez, man. It'll work.
Give it a chance.

546
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,936
Did you move my...?

547
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,401
Where is my car?

548
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,006
Oh, my God, man.

549
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,575
What did I say to you?
I told you not to park here.

550
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,178
Why would you park
in the staff parking lot?

551
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,678
Shut the fuck up, Fogell.

552
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,442
I mean, because you're not staff.

553
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:16,179
I know that, Fagell! I know that!

554
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,456
Evan, let's go to your house.

555
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,222
Wait, are you guys
still picking me up from work?

556
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,223
Can you answer me?

557
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,767
Man, don't you have
any non-infant clothes?

558
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,807
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

559
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,169
Why don't you just wear
what you wore to school?

560
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,437
I can't do that. I can't let Jules
see me in what I wore to school.

561
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,080
It's completely unbecoming.

562
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,683
No one's gotten a handjob
in cargo shorts since Nam.

563
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:49,753
I have to kill these guys.
You don't negotiate with terrorists.

564
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,789
Really? Yeah, that's what
we should be talking about right now.

565
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,460
Then why don't you go
and get some of your own clothes?

566
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,026
That's the dumbest thing ever.

567
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,357
My parents will see that my car's
been towed and I'll be grounded.

568
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,693
These fucking terrorists
multiply like bunnies.

569
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,199
Where did I leave the M16?

570
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,804
Do you have any bigger clothes
or do you only shop at babyGap?

571
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,237
Fuck me. I can't...

572
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,040
That's fun.
Why do they make that?

573
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:16,305
If you can't even win,
then why am I fucking playing?

574
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,278
Do you wanna go see
what my dad has?

575
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:43,371
<i>What the fuck?</i>

576
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,005
What the hell is that?

577
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,148
It's a fucking vest, dumbass.

578
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,818
- I'm trying to look older.
- You look like Pinocchio.

579
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,510
- It's just a vest.
- They got a lot of booze in there.

580
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:58,691
If we get it now, we can get
to the party faster with Jules' shit.

581
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,087
No way, man. I work there.
They know I'm not 25.

582
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:03,319
Nobody said anything about you,
dick-mouth.

583
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,555
You really fucked me on this one.

584
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,562
So now I'm gonna steal the booze.

585
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,531
Don't do this.
I promise you I'll get the liquor later.

586
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:13,035
Mike Snider's ID always works.
So will mine, man.

587
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,675
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have
one fucking name on it! Okay?

588
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:20,471
I thought you Dartmouth guys would
be smart enough to understand that.

589
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,346
Now Seth's gotta
pick up all the pieces.

590
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,211
He won't do it. Don't worry.

591
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:28,615
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we
can have the TV from the basement...

592
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:30,516
Shut the fuck up,
he's gonna hear you.

593
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,520
Just be quiet.
Wait until he goes away.

594
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,285
You still haven't told him
that we're rooming together?

595
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:36,928
Fogell, shut the fuck up.

596
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,223
And take off your vest.
You look like Aladdin.

597
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,128
Okay. You got it.

598
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:52,902
Hope piggy can run.

599
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,652
How old are you?

600
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,421
Twenty-two.

601
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,560
You certainly are.
That'll be 80 dollars.

602
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,864
Okay.

603
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,369
Thank you kindly. Will that do?

604
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:22,768
Certainly will. Thank you, Seth.

605
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,944
Hey, thank you.

606
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:36,988
You dropped your purse, ma'am.

607
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,623
Would you like some help?

608
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:41,020
Well, that would be lovely,
young man.

609
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:44,321
Would you like me
to buy you alcohol?

610
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:46,822
That would be lovely.

611
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:49,593
- Enjoy your remaining years.
- I will.

612
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,101
- Enjoy fucking Jules.
- I will.

613
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,052
Don't do it, kid.

614
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,198
I never had a choice.

615
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,171
You fucking killed her!

616
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:31,210
No!

617
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:44,523
Where's all the stolen liquor?
Did you hide it up your butt?

618
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:47,522
Piss off! I was gonna do it,
but there was a security breach.

619
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:48,955
You never would've done it.

620
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:52,393
Let's go to a liquor store
and watch your stupid ID get rejected.

621
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,032
Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest
back in my locker.

622
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,755
All right. Here we are. This is it.

623
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,260
- You ready? Yeah?
- Yeah.

624
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:29,866
- Here's the money and the list.
- Change is yours. Keep the change.

625
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,129
- Thank you. What's the list for?
- The alcohol.

626
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:36,240
We're gonna get alcohol
for the whole party, okay?

627
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:39,104
We put a lot of time into this list,
so don't fuck it up.

628
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:40,279
It's perfect.

629
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,813
<i>Ouzo, bourbon,
spiced rum, Goldslick...</i>

630
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,484
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca.
Don't forget that.

631
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,419
<i>Raspberry vodka, Scotch...</i>

632
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:51,385
And Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
A six-pack.

633
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,492
This is a lot. I don't know
if I can get away with all this.

634
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:56,093
What difference does it make?

635
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:59,662
I don't know, man.
I'm, like, really nervous.

636
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,734
- Are you okay?
- No, man. I should have wore the vest.

637
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,267
- Calm down.
- What the fuck are you doing?

638
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,336
What if I go in
and they turn me down, man?

639
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,405
Then we're in the same place
we're in now.

640
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,304
- Who cares?
- It's fucking humiliating!

641
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,308
Everybody sees them
kicking me out.

642
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:16,607
What if they make me
put the liquor back? I can't do that.

643
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:19,182
This whole thing
is bigger than you, Fogell!

644
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,752
So grow a pair of nuts and fucking
walk in there and buy the alcohol!

645
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,484
What if I don't feel like it
anymore, Seth? What?

646
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,488
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?

647
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,661
I'll stab you
through your fucking heart.

648
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,352
No, you can do this, man.
Come on.

649
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:34,431
Killing me won't get you alcohol.
I'm the one with the fake ID.

650
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,625
Then I'll cut
your dumb fucking face off...

651
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:39,930
...throw it over mine and get your ID
and buy it my fucking self!

652
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,006
Oh, really? You don't have
the technology or the steady hands...

653
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,177
...to pull off a procedure like that,
so ha!

654
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:46,868
Peace.

655
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:50,038
Fogell, just be cool, man.
Get in and get out.

656
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,216
You're the hero.

657
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,487
Sorry.

658
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:27,245
Is there a problem here, sir?

659
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:30,786
No. No problem whatsoever.

660
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:36,655
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

661
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,330
No.

662
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,158
And you should really clean this up.

663
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,527
Someone could really
hurt themselves.

664
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,168
Fuck my life.

665
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,205
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

666
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,238
This plan's been fucked
since Jump Street.

667
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:53,037
Okay, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

668
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,309
Hey, so did you bring a condom
for tonight?

669
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,450
You brought a condom with you?

670
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,516
Yeah. I figured
I might as well, you know?

671
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,245
I brought a little bottle
of spermicidal lube too.

672
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,622
You laughed in my face
when I said I'd be having sex tonight.

673
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:11,126
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't always be prepared.

674
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,628
- You didn't even bring a condom?
- No.

675
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,630
No, Evan,
that wasn't part of the plan.

676
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,860
You did this
without consulting with me.

677
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,733
We've never discussed, like, any plan,
but you keep saying we have a plan.

678
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:24,876
I had, like, a general outline.
You know?

679
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,875
I was gonna go down on her
for, like, several hours, okay?

680
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,981
She would love that. She'd be smitten.
She'd go out with that.

681
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,878
Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.

682
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,111
Well, I just... I don't see the harm
in bringing one little condom.

683
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,449
And one little bottle
of spermicidal lube?

684
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,092
Yeah, one little bottle
of spermicidal lube.

685
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:44,092
- Evan, that's psycho shit, man.
- No, it's not.

686
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,924
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.

687
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:49,226
What, do you think Becca's gonna be
psyched that you brought lube?

688
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,836
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing
that lube for my pussy.

689
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,133
I never would've been able to handle
your fucking 4-inch dick...

690
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,436
...inside my pussy
without that gigantic bottle of lube."

691
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,272
- Okay, that's... That's enough.
- Fuck.

692
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,108
These girls are 18,
they're not dried-up old ladies.

693
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:06,308
- They're good to go.
- Then I won't bring the lube.

694
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,488
Don't make me feel like that.
I thought it was cool.

695
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,987
- This is a nice kind.
- Let me see that for a second.

696
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,182
- An impressive kind.
- It is kind of cool.

697
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,088
- That's cool.
- Fucking dumbass. Lube?

698
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,660
- That's funny.
- You brought lube?

699
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:21,094
You owe me 6 bucks because I'm not
walking over to get it and it exploded.

700
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:24,997
Hello, Mindy.

701
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:40,277
I love that stuff.
Been drinking it for years.

702
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:46,021
You know, I heard they recently
decided to add more hops to it.

703
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:51,490
Okay.

704
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,188
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

705
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,666
Really?

706
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,100
Makes me feel young again.
There you go.

707
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,970
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.

708
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,615
She had the biggest tits
I've ever seen.

709
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,646
I heard she got
breast-reduction surgery.

710
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,512
What? Making your tits smaller?

711
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,779
That's like slapping God
for giving you a gorgeous gift.

712
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,251
She had back problems, man.

713
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,551
And it's not just making them smaller.
They completely reshape them.

714
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,695
They make them
more supple and symmetrical.

715
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,363
I gotta catch a glimpse
of these warlocks.

716
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,123
Let's make a move.

717
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,533
- She's going around the corner.
- Come on!

718
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:40,878
Okay. Your total is 96.59.

719
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,085
I don't believe it!

720
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:55,050
Are you okay, mister?

721
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,988
What the shit was that?

722
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:02,558
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

723
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,401
I don't believe it.

724
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,970
I don't know, man.
I think she looked better before.

725
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:11,575
But now that she can jog comfortably,
she's in the best shape she's ever...

726
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:16,710
What is this? What's that?

727
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:20,714
Oh, man.

728
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,016
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

729
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:30,027
How did this happen, Evan?
Fuck, man!

730
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,720
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

731
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,091
Look, okay?

732
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:36,700
He assaulted the customer,
grabbed the cash and ran out.

733
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:37,870
<i>So...</i>

734
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:39,698
- How...?
- How...? How...? How...?

735
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:43,307
- Say when, height-wise.
- I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.

736
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,739
- I'll start on the bottom and...
- When.

737
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,970
Whatever 5'10" is,
he was 5'10".

738
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,843
Ethnically, I mean, did... What...?

739
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:56,613
I mean, was he...?
Was he like us, or...?

740
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:59,288
A woman?

741
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,516
- Female?
- No.

742
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,218
- Is that what you're asking?
- No, no. Was he...?

743
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,396
<i>- Like...
- What? What?</i>

744
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:05,564
- African?
- Af... Af...

745
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,289
- Was he African?
- African.

746
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,559
No. He was American,
and he was like you.

747
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,636
- He looked just like you.
- He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.

748
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,330
- It's an odd crime for a Jew.
- They're pretty docile.

749
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:19,136
Okay, so we have an African Jew
wearing a hoodie.

750
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,872
No, you don't. No. That's not what
I said. Is that what you heard me say?

751
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,880
I said he looked like you.
Do you look like an African Jew?

752
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,914
- No, I look like a cop.
- Yeah.

753
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:32,451
He was Caucasian.

754
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,422
- Caucasian.
- All right.

755
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:35,594
- Okay.
- Well, touch.

756
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:38,127
Kind of looked like Eminem.
Does that help you?

757
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,298
- An M&M.
- An M&M.

758
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,195
- So he was circular...?
- Marshall Mathers. Eminem?

759
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:45,599
- The rapper, Eminem.
- Did he look like this?

760
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,630
- I'm an amateur. I kind of...
- That looks like an M&M.

761
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:53,210
Longer face? Bigger nose?
Would you say his mouth was wider?

762
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:54,778
Open? A gap?

763
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:59,816
Is there another squad car in the area
that could be of further assistance?

764
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,646
I don't seem to be getting any.

765
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,755
Okay, so just walk me through again
what this guy did.

766
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:08,017
He... He... He came in, he's wielding...

767
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:12,493
He's wielding something. He hits
this small gentleman in the slacks.

768
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,725
And then he jumps over you,
he feels you up, violates you.

769
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,596
- I did not say that.
- No, he doesn't.

770
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:21,433
Look, I can't do this. I told you already,
I have an exam tomorrow.

771
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:24,974
Can you understand that?
I have a goddamn veterinary exam!

772
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:28,309
Goddamn it. This is bullshit.

773
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:31,244
This is some bullshit.
I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.

774
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,316
Well, apparently someone
has an exam.

775
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,180
How'd you know?

776
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:37,682
You. You're the one
that got punched?

777
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,517
- Yeah.
- Okay.

778
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,092
First things first.
What is your name?

779
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,694
My name?

780
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,700
It's M... McLov... McLovin.

781
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:53,772
McLovin?

782
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,338
Yeah.

783
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,899
Now, what's your first name?

784
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,305
What?

785
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,343
- Your first name?
- My first name?

786
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:07,279
Technically I don't have a first name,
so don't worry about my first name.

787
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:10,515
But we're the police.

788
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:12,554
We just wanna get
the story straight.

789
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:15,253
- Come on.
- Fuck, man.

790
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:17,861
- Come on!
- He must be so afraid.

791
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:21,033
I don't believe this bullshit.
I can't believe this is happening!

792
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:24,726
I didn't know you could get arrested
for this shit. We need that liquor.

793
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,565
- Are they gonna take him downtown?
- Fuck Fogell.

794
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:29,605
He got arrested, okay?
We're on our own.

795
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,333
We need a new way to get liq...

796
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:35,139
Fuck! The money, man! Fuck!
How much money can you get?

797
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:37,509
Why are you talking about money?
What about Fogell?

798
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:41,380
That doesn't matter anymore. I lost
a hundred dollars of Jules' money.

799
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:45,148
Are we gonna bust him out of jail?
Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?

800
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,419
Fuck Fogell. We need a new way to
get liquor, which is fucking impossible.

801
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:52,530
All right, you need to calm down.
We need to think for a second.

802
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,496
- We need to think this out.
- Fuck thinking, we need to act!

803
00:43:57,837 --> 00:43:59,065
Seth!

804
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:02,105
- What the fuck happened?
- Just... Just get up. Slowly.

805
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:05,072
You all right? You okay?

806
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:08,213
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.

807
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:12,407
I didn't even effing see you at all, man.
Are you okay?

808
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:16,019
So it's just McLovin?

809
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:17,780
Yeah.

810
00:44:18,558 --> 00:44:20,753
- That's badass.
- That is badass.

811
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,188
- Really cool.
- A badass name.

812
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:25,091
- Lot of people with weird names.
- Chingy. Shakira.

813
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,731
Rafe. Pax.

814
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:30,061
We arrested a man-lady
who was legally named "Fuck."

815
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,134
Think he was Vietnamese,
it was with a P-H.

816
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:34,306
But it's still shocking
to see on a license.

817
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:38,034
- Okay, and how old are you, McLovin?
- Old enough.

818
00:44:39,445 --> 00:44:40,912
Old enough for what?

819
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:45,282
To party.

820
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:51,487
Can I see your ID?

821
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:54,117
Yeah, I think I have it.

822
00:45:18,651 --> 00:45:21,814
- You're an organ donor.
- What?

823
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:23,716
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.

824
00:45:23,923 --> 00:45:25,686
I give him shit for it too. All the time.

825
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:28,918
I say, "It's just like a woman.
Even after you're dead...

826
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:32,188
<i>...they wanna tear your heart out."
- They wanna tear your...</i>

827
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:35,162
- I say it weekly and it's still funny.
- It still makes me laugh.

828
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:36,801
- Really funny.
- There you go.

829
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:40,097
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't really have any information.

830
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:42,866
He just hit me,
and I didn't see what he looked like.

831
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,441
- I don't know if I can help you.
- You in a hurry?

832
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:47,670
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.

833
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,577
- Where were you headed?
- Near 13th and Granville.

834
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:55,183
- We can take you there.
- Get your information on the way.

835
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:57,652
- Why waste 2 bucks?
- We'll take you. No problem.

836
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:01,486
Please don't report me, man.
We can figure this out, right?

837
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:04,288
Why the fuck wouldn't I report you?
You just hit me.

838
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:08,323
Because I'll do anything.

839
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:11,025
Please, okay? Anything.
Like, literally...

840
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:12,670
...fucking anything.

841
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:16,467
Name anything. Name it. Name it.

842
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:20,307
All right, look. Hey, man. All right.

843
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:21,946
Listen, you can trust me, okay?

844
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:25,379
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

845
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:29,219
I have a warrant out
for a totally nonviolent crime.

846
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:33,153
Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.

847
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,054
I'll be honest with you for a second.

848
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:37,491
You better get us a shitload of cash
or a shitload of alcohol...

849
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:39,358
...or you're going to fucking prison.

850
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:41,658
What are you doing, man?
You don't need to...

851
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:43,835
No, let's not...
Let's hang on a second here.

852
00:46:44,036 --> 00:46:45,094
- Cough it up.
- Fine.

853
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,135
Don't know if we should be
doing anything official.

854
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:50,274
<i>We're working together. It's like
Let's Make a Deal. Here we go.</i>

855
00:46:51,177 --> 00:46:52,576
Seven bucks?

856
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:55,838
Are you fucking serious? This isn't
enough. What are you, a 6-year-old?

857
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:59,744
- It's all I have, man. It's all I have.
- You better think of something quickly.

858
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:03,911
- My back! My back. Cops, my back.
- No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.

859
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:06,387
All right, listen.
I can get you alcohol.

860
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:08,753
I'm going over to this party
right now, bro. Okay?

861
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:12,897
<i>It's got booze, it's got girls.
Booze and girls equals...</i>

862
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,294
I don't know. Do you?
I don't know. Do you?

863
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:18,436
- I think you do. Do you?
- Yes. That's a definite yes.

864
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:19,605
Definite yes, then.

865
00:47:19,805 --> 00:47:22,137
- Give me one sec to talk to him.
- Stay right here.

866
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:25,640
Yeah, yeah. Do what you gotta do.
Mix it over. I'll be over by the car.

867
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:28,814
Just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.

868
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:31,742
- Come on, it's great.
- What are you thinking?

869
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:33,418
- What are you doing?
- What?

870
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,019
I lost Jules' money,
Fogell's dead to us now...

871
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:37,814
...we don't have any choice.
Let's go.

872
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,993
I don't like this idea. This guy's
fucking creepy, man. Look at him.

873
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,957
What? He looks like a guy.
That's what guys look like.

874
00:47:44,163 --> 00:47:46,791
- What is your problem?
- You guys know a guy named Jimmy?

875
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,229
You totally look like his brother.

876
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:51,869
You totally
look like his brother, man.

877
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:53,629
You do.

878
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:57,138
You promised Becca
you'd get her alcohol.

879
00:47:57,343 --> 00:47:59,311
If you don't, she's gonna have
a shitty night.

880
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:01,480
That's all I'm saying. Come on.

881
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:04,249
We bingo, bango, ready to go, go?

882
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,375
- Good luck on your exam tomorrow.
- Good luck on your exam.

883
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:10,487
- You don't wanna ride the bus.
- Buses smell like piss, generally.

884
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,657
- You know why?
- Why?

885
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:13,449
People piss on them.

886
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:24,558
You know, one of you bros could've
come up and sat up with me.

887
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,465
- We're fine back here.
- Back's fine.

888
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:28,606
Safe in the back seat.

889
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,136
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

890
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:37,107
- Hey, Jules.
- Who is it? Who's on the phone?

891
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:38,783
Seth. Hey, where are you?

892
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:42,442
I'm in a cab right now,
on the way to a liquor store.

893
00:48:42,655 --> 00:48:44,452
Good. I can't wait
for you to get here.

894
00:48:44,657 --> 00:48:47,182
Well, I hope your friends
are ready to get fucked up.

895
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:50,022
<i>I'm sure they will be.</i>

896
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:52,424
<i>- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Peace.</i>

897
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:55,196
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.

898
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:58,131
She called, she said,
"I can't wait for you to get there."

899
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:01,272
That sounds like
she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!

900
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:05,968
Who's gonna give it to her, huh,
my man? You, that's who.

901
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:08,373
Man.

902
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:10,409
You guys on MySpace, or...?

903
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:27,523
Officers? I can answer those
questions now if you want me to.

904
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:30,759
We get the gist of it. You were
buying beer, some guys punched you.

905
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,165
Don't worry about it.
We're not gonna find them.

906
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:35,932
- Case closed.
- But it was only...

907
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:50,311
- But it was only one guy.
- Only one guy? Shit.

908
00:49:50,523 --> 00:49:52,115
How am I supposed to
find one guy?

909
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:55,761
<i>This job really isn't how, you know,
shows like CSI make it out to be.</i>

910
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:59,591
When I first joined the force, I assumed
there was semen on everything...

911
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:02,267
...and there was some, like,
huge semen database...

912
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:05,631
...that had every bad guy's semen in it.
There isn't. That doesn't exist.

913
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:08,636
I often go to sleep and dream of
waking up in a world where...

914
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:11,275
...everything's covered in semen.
- I mean, who doesn't?

915
00:50:11,477 --> 00:50:13,445
Lt'd be nice.
Like that crime scene today.

916
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:16,080
If the man had ejaculated
and then punched you...

917
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,909
...we'd have a shot at catching him.

918
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:20,347
- No way.
- Just punched in the face, no semen.

919
00:50:20,553 --> 00:50:23,044
- No semen.
- Story of my life.

920
00:50:28,261 --> 00:50:32,061
Michaels here, he's six months in.

921
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:35,299
He's young,
but the Force is strong with this one.

922
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:37,901
Learning you are, young padawan.

923
00:50:38,104 --> 00:50:39,696
Thank you very much.

924
00:50:40,973 --> 00:50:43,339
- That's Yoda.
- Are you familiar with Yoda?

925
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,033
<i>From Attack of the Clones?</i>

926
00:50:45,244 --> 00:50:49,305
<i>We have a 245 at East 24 and
Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.</i>

927
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:51,483
Car 98 on it.

928
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,619
See, Michaels, you always
take a call at a bar because...

929
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:56,880
...better or worse,
you get a beer out of it.

930
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:58,882
Pretty sweet, huh?

931
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,185
- True that. Amazing thinking.
- Hey, McLovin.

932
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,454
We got a situation at Bailey's,
so we'll drop you off after, all right?

933
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:06,689
Actually, I kind of
have to be somewhere...

934
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:09,959
- Sweet. Sit tight.
- Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.

935
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:11,500
Engage.

936
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,438
Yeah.

937
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:21,704
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

938
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,478
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool
that we're here with you?

939
00:51:26,686 --> 00:51:28,017
Oh, definitely, man.

940
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:30,189
I'm essentially
best friends with the guy...

941
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,324
...so a bunch of my buds
are coming.

942
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:35,323
We're gonna rock out
with our cocks out. Just kidding.

943
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:38,258
- We are gonna rock out.
- Just go, just go.

944
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:40,432
What's up? What's up? What's up?

945
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,067
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

946
00:52:01,854 --> 00:52:03,981
This is something
a smart person wouldn't do.

947
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,818
Look, just act cool and act casual,
and try and look old.

948
00:52:07,026 --> 00:52:09,688
We'll get the booze
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

949
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:15,760
Hey, where the party at? Right.

950
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,732
- You got those shots, bro?
- It's coming.

951
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:21,229
Come on, let's party.

952
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:24,842
Come on. Do it up.

953
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:32,844
We should grab one of these buckets
and get out.

954
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:35,816
You out of your mind? How are we
gonna get a fucking bucket out?

955
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:37,887
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Hey, man.

956
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,887
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

957
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:43,118
- What are you...? What? Nothing.
- You using my phone?

958
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:46,958
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang up. Nothing.

959
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,031
What... What...
What's wrong, Mark?

960
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,931
You weren't invited.
Get the fuck out of here.

961
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:55,232
- Come on, Mark. It's cool, man.
- You using my fucking phone?

962
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:57,238
You calling your
fucking friends again?

963
00:52:57,443 --> 00:52:59,536
You calling your friends,
your fantastic friends?

964
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:01,645
No. I mean, yes. But I mean I'll...

965
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:04,282
Come on, man, just relax.
Mark, please.

966
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,645
Get the fuck out of here.
The fuck out of my house.

967
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,320
Get the fuck out of my house.

968
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:11,684
- This is my house.
- Don't be such a dick, man!

969
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,457
What the fuck?

970
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:15,650
Mark! You really wanna do this, man?

971
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:18,456
Here we go.
We're really gonna do this?

972
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,796
That's right, motherfucker.

973
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:25,165
Come on, pussy. Get up, dude.

974
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:28,435
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.

975
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:32,236
Tiger got out of the cage, man.
All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.

976
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:34,606
Let's just chill.
Everyone just chill out.

977
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:37,014
Truce, man.

978
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:41,853
Right in the nads!

979
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:47,846
This is for your friends.
Here, have another one.

980
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:51,253
Shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
Oh, my God. What do we do?

981
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:53,154
- Come on. Come on.
- Choose one.

982
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:59,097
- We can slip out the back, man.
- Come on. Let's hurry up and do this.

983
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,393
Are you crazy, man?
Wanna end up like that guy?

984
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:04,163
Not me. I need my nuts, man,
for a lot of things.

985
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:06,101
- We need liquor.
- You need it. I don't.

986
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:08,969
I'm gonna tell Becca how I feel.
Maybe she'll get with me.

987
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:11,475
I'm not gonna get her
drunk out of her mind.

988
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,443
Oh, really? Then how come
you never made a move, you pussy?

989
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:18,016
Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not
gonna put unfair pressure on her.

990
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,210
I don't see a problem.
Let's just do it.

991
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:23,117
We're leaving, okay?
You wanna get killed for liquor?

992
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:26,623
No, but I would get killed for pussy,
no questions asked.

993
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:29,956
- Fuck this, man.
- You're just gonna bail on me?

994
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:33,031
- I'm going.
- Fucking bitch.

995
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,933
Move, people.

996
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:40,567
- Thank you.
- Oh, I love this place.

997
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:51,378
What the hell is going on in there?

998
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:53,816
If the bullets start flying,
hit the deck.

999
00:54:54,022 --> 00:54:56,217
You pissed everywhere,
you son of a bitch!

1000
00:54:56,424 --> 00:54:59,655
Everywhere? You didn't
see me pissing anywhere.

1001
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:01,590
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1002
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:03,491
Take your nuts out of your shells!

1003
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:05,290
Michaels, I got your back.

1004
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,400
Why don't you show this rummy
how we roll?

1005
00:55:07,602 --> 00:55:08,899
10-4.

1006
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:12,496
Excuse me, sir.
Stop what you are doing at once.

1007
00:55:13,808 --> 00:55:16,936
- Blue guys!
- Resisting. Resisting!

1008
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:18,703
- Slater!
- Michaels!

1009
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,408
Everybody stay calm.

1010
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:25,446
- Everybody stay calm.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

1011
00:55:25,853 --> 00:55:27,616
Stay calm! Fuck!

1012
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,456
- Should I shoot him?
- No, no, no!

1013
00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:32,922
- No!
- Stop him, McLovin!

1014
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:35,857
McLovin, stop him!
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

1015
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:43,632
Please stop it, you fucking bum.
What the fuck?

1016
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,311
McLovin! Nice!

1017
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:03,789
He just came at me.
I took him down.

1018
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:06,517
- I'm buying you a beer, McLovin.
- I'm buying you one too.

1019
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:09,288
Take note. That's how
you take down a motherfucker.

1020
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:10,862
That's right.

1021
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,625
McLovin in the fucking house!

1022
00:56:47,903 --> 00:56:52,237
Hey. You dance hot.

1023
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:54,870
Thank you.

1024
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:14,492
Okay, okay. Here we... Here we go.

1025
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:17,058
<i>- Hello?
- Evan, it's Becca.</i>

1026
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:18,994
Oh, Becca. Hi.

1027
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:23,433
Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.

1028
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:25,328
<i>- Becca...
- Evan, can you hear me?</i>

1029
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,565
<i>- Hello? What?
- Can you hear...? Piece of shit!</i>

1030
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:30,142
Guy sells me
a piece of shit fucking phone.

1031
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:31,778
- Becca?
- It's Becca.

1032
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,971
<i>I get one bar
everywhere I fucking go.</i>

1033
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,946
<i>- What is he saying?
- Fucking asshole.</i>

1034
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:38,915
- I think...
- What happened?

1035
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,678
Son-of-a-fucking-bitch
phone company.

1036
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:43,551
<i>- What? It's rude. Hello?
- Fuck. You suck.</i>

1037
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:45,385
Bullshit phone. Piece of shit.

1038
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:47,926
<i>I swear I'll bitchslap you
so fucking hard.</i>

1039
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:49,687
- What?
- Bec...?

1040
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:35,607
Thanks.

1041
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:39,041
This is fucking crazy.

1042
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:51,354
Hey. Look what fell out of the truck!

1043
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:54,627
You're full of shit.

1044
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:56,763
Yeah, I know.

1045
00:58:57,465 --> 00:59:02,061
Dude. Dude.
We're so gonna get fucked up.

1046
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,602
- All right.
- Hey.

1047
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,767
What is that?

1048
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:09,770
I don't know. What?

1049
00:59:09,978 --> 00:59:13,709
That fucking stain on your pants, idiot.
What is that?

1050
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:16,308
- What are you talking about, man?
- Dude.

1051
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:19,686
- Is that blood?
- What the fuck is that?

1052
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:21,856
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm not cut or anything.

1053
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:24,753
- Why would I be bleeding?
- It's fucking blood, man.

1054
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:28,589
Were you dancing
with some chick in there?

1055
00:59:29,164 --> 00:59:31,394
- Yeah, so?
- It's blood.

1056
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,126
- Dude, that's not funny.
- It's blood, dude.

1057
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:38,864
But why would I be bleeding?
Why the fuck would I be bl...?

1058
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,837
Dude, why would there be bl...?

1059
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:46,113
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

1060
00:59:48,316 --> 00:59:51,717
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna fucking throw up.

1061
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,444
Someone perioded
on my fucking leg?

1062
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,714
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck do I do?

1063
00:59:55,924 --> 00:59:58,154
I've never before
seen that in my life!

1064
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,021
This is so disgusting.

1065
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:01,718
- Yes, it is.
- I'm gonna go get Bill.

1066
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,454
- He's gotta check this shit out.
- Fuck, yeah.

1067
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:06,862
No. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill!
Bill has nothing to do with this!

1068
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:09,628
Hey, calm down.
Let me get a picture of that real quick.

1069
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:11,169
No, you can't have a picture!

1070
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:13,238
- Dude, stop!
- Bill, Bill! Check it out!

1071
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,341
This kid's got period blood
on his slacks.

1072
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,340
It's merlot.
That's what you don't get.

1073
01:00:17,545 --> 01:00:20,173
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's
got period blood on his pants!

1074
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:22,350
- Please stop.
- God, man, let me see.

1075
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,485
Oh, my God,
that's a fucking man-gina, man.

1076
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:29,088
- Do you need a tampon? I could...
- Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!

1077
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,749
Yeah, right? I don't know.

1078
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,986
- I gotta wash this off. Is this the line?
- What does it look like?

1079
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:36,857
Fuck me, right?

1080
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,604
"Yeah, I'm McLovin.
I'd like to buy some..."

1081
01:00:56,818 --> 01:00:58,410
Shit.

1082
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,952
- Rewind, rewind.
- Rewind it. Yeah!

1083
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:03,181
So hot. Let's see it again.

1084
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,061
- Your legs lifted off the ground.
- That is bona fide badass, man.

1085
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:11,630
You gotta keep that tape, McLovin.
It is badass.

1086
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,095
- It really is.
- Really?

1087
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:16,134
Well, don't you guys, like,
need it for, like, evidence or...?

1088
01:01:16,337 --> 01:01:19,500
The only thing that's evidence of
is you can take a hit like a champ.

1089
01:01:19,707 --> 01:01:21,402
Seriously. Take that.

1090
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:26,205
Are there any ladies
we'd like to show this tape to?

1091
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:30,508
No. You don't wanna meet a chick
in a bar, man. Seriously.

1092
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:33,346
That was a turning point
in my life, when I realized that.

1093
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:37,753
You gotta go to other places. You gotta
go to a spin class, a farmers' market...

1094
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:40,655
...pumpkin patch,
given the time of year.

1095
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:43,330
Just somewhere social,
non-threatening.

1096
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:46,762
- You know, something like that.
- Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.

1097
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:49,937
<i>Yeah, I shot her in the neck.
And we just...</i>

1098
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:52,003
And we just hit it off, you know.

1099
01:01:52,207 --> 01:01:55,643
My first wife...
Who is a whore, by the way.

1100
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:57,175
- Where do you think I met her?

1101
01:01:57,378 --> 01:02:00,211
A bar. A bar.

1102
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:02,406
- It was this bar.
- It was this bar.

1103
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:04,778
Yeah, it was this bar.

1104
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:08,750
Bought her a Binion's,
complimented her on her tote bag...

1105
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:13,826
...and next thing I know, she's putting
her mouth around the tip of my penis.

1106
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:16,654
You don't have to tell me that.

1107
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:19,629
- Right in there.
- She opened up my world, sexually.

1108
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:22,234
On our wedding night,
we had group sex.

1109
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:23,802
I wasn't involved in it.

1110
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:26,530
- But I could hear it through the wall.
- I was.

1111
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:29,733
She was amazing. And then it was
exactly 23 months later...

1112
01:02:29,944 --> 01:02:31,969
...that I found out
she was an actual whore.

1113
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,148
- We discovered her on the street.
- Yeah.

1114
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:35,782
I'm sorry.

1115
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:38,214
She was bad.
Fucking whoring bitch.

1116
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:41,855
<i>- But you got a new wife now, so...
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1117
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:44,354
And she is wonderful.

1118
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,527
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You'll meet her.

1119
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:48,889
You know what?
I bet I know your trick, McLovin.

1120
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,429
<i>- You play the whole myst...
- Calling all units.</i>

1121
01:02:51,633 --> 01:02:53,260
Just turn that off.

1122
01:02:53,468 --> 01:02:56,460
<i>Send backup!
There's so much blood...</i>

1123
01:02:56,671 --> 01:03:00,402
I bet you play the whole
mysterious-guy thing, right?

1124
01:03:01,209 --> 01:03:04,406
Yeah, seriously.
How's it going with the ladies?

1125
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:08,706
It's not the going with the ladies
I care about...

1126
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,715
...it's the coming.

1127
01:03:13,588 --> 01:03:15,556
- I get it.
- What is it? What is it?

1128
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:17,054
Like:

1129
01:03:17,258 --> 01:03:18,919
Like coming.

1130
01:03:21,796 --> 01:03:26,028
- That's funny. That is really funny.
- Oh, my God.

1131
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,202
All right, looks like we got a call.
We can't pay for these.

1132
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:35,706
10-4. We'll be right there.

1133
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,538
- Speedy Gonzales, let's go.
- We should get road beers.

1134
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,048
Hell, yeah,
we should get some road beers.

1135
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:43,410
Can I have 13 beers to go, please?

1136
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:46,849
Please. God, my fucking leg.

1137
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:04,765
Fuck.

1138
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:33,365
- I think it's him.
- Is it him?

1139
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:34,830
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Becca.</i>

1140
01:04:35,036 --> 01:04:38,733
<i>Hi, I had a bad reception.
So about your Goldslick...</i>

1141
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,636
- Guys, shut up.
- Hey, what's going on over there?

1142
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,902
It's nothing. It's just...

1143
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:46,979
I was just calling, you know,
to see if you were coming...

1144
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:50,412
...because I thought maybe you were
stuck at, like, a nightclub...

1145
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:53,143
...or a cocktail party or something.

1146
01:04:53,354 --> 01:04:56,619
No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure.
Full throttle.

1147
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:58,519
<i>- Charlie's Angels 2.
- Awesome.</i>

1148
01:05:00,428 --> 01:05:02,726
<i>- I can't wait to see you. Evan?
- Okay, bye.</i>

1149
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,388
That was the first time I ever did coke.
Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...

1150
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,330
- A little white sniff.
- That was awesome.

1151
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:09,503
That was gorgeous.

1152
01:05:09,704 --> 01:05:12,969
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys, stay in this room, man.

1153
01:05:13,174 --> 01:05:16,371
They're gonna kill that guy tonight.
That chick's boyfriend is pissed.

1154
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,101
Yeah. He's a beast.

1155
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:21,338
I've been praying for a fight.
I'm literally waking up and praying...

1156
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:23,483
...to see a fucking fight.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1157
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,880
Who's that guy?

1158
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:32,915
- Hi.
- Who is that guy?

1159
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:35,152
- Who's this guy?
- Pleasure to see you fellas.

1160
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:36,421
Hi, everyone.

1161
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,292
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.

1162
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,057
No, no, no. I know you. I know you.

1163
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,498
He was at that party
I was telling you about.

1164
01:05:42,704 --> 01:05:43,864
- No, no.
- Who is it?

1165
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:47,200
Remember? He's Jimmy's brother.
The guy. The singer.

1166
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:50,042
- No.
- He's the guy with the beautiful voice.

1167
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:52,804
- The fucking singer, Jimmy's brother!
- That's not me, man.

1168
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:54,743
- Oh, my God.
- Sing for us! Sing.

1169
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,416
"It's not me"? You fucking lying?

1170
01:05:56,617 --> 01:05:59,711
No, I don't mean to accuse you guys
of being ill-informed, but...

1171
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:02,287
My brother came from Scottsdale,
Arizona to be here.

1172
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,855
You're not gonna sing for him?

1173
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:05,218
- Fucking bullshit.
- Sing.

1174
01:06:05,426 --> 01:06:07,587
- You're a fucking singer.
- You sing good.

1175
01:06:07,795 --> 01:06:09,262
- Sing it again.
- Like a bird.

1176
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:12,126
- No, I know, I just... I want to.
- You want a line of cocaine?

1177
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,425
- No way, man.
- Yeah.

1178
01:06:13,634 --> 01:06:15,795
Don't make this weird. Sing.

1179
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:18,164
- Sing it again.
- Turbo.

1180
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,568
- Fuck! Over!
- Okay, watch this.

1181
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:27,612
I'll get it right on the nose.

1182
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:30,045
You're gonna fuck it up.
You're gonna fuck it up.

1183
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,082
Under!

1184
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:34,481
I feel hammered.
That doesn't make any sense.

1185
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,283
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Okay, okay. Great, great.

1186
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:40,950
- Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it.
- The kid's gonna nail it.

1187
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:44,029
Come on, McLovin.
Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!

1188
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:46,826
- Bring it!
- 0.08, motherfuckers!

1189
01:06:47,034 --> 01:06:49,696
- Man!
- That's my boy!

1190
01:06:50,104 --> 01:06:52,038
- Yes!
- Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.

1191
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:55,705
So, what's it like to have guns?

1192
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,606
It is awesome, McLovin.

1193
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:00,474
- I mean, it's mindbl...
- It's great.

1194
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:03,411
I haven't had one for long,
a few months, but I'll tell you...

1195
01:07:03,618 --> 01:07:05,381
...it's like having two cocks.
- Yup.

1196
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,419
If one of your cocks
could kill someone.

1197
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:12,084
- Can I hold one?
- What?

1198
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:13,590
Can I hold one of your guns?

1199
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:19,924
- Yeah, sure.
- Fine with me. Why not?

1200
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:22,432
Everyone should hold a gun
at least a couple times.

1201
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,070
Yeah, there you go.

1202
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:26,604
- Have a blast.
- "Have a blast."

1203
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:30,972
- That's funny.
- I've never held one of these before.

1204
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:33,909
- Are they hard to shoot?
- Lf you're Michaels, they are.

1205
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:35,810
- He can't shoot worth dick.
- What?

1206
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:37,507
I can shoot. What are you...? Wait.

1207
01:07:37,718 --> 01:07:40,016
- I can't shoot worth dick?
- You cannot shoot.

1208
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:42,655
- I shot that cat last week.
- It was already dead, man.

1209
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:44,415
- I still shot it.
- That cat was dead.

1210
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,490
There's only one way
to settle this, guys.

1211
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:48,551
- Shoot-off.
- Shoot-off.

1212
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,596
- Shoot-off!
- Shoot-off!

1213
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,494
There's a lot of reasons
why I like you.

1214
01:07:53,701 --> 01:07:55,999
I mean, you're handsome
and you're a good friend.

1215
01:07:56,204 --> 01:08:00,231
Dude, there he is. That's the guy.
Hey, Mark, right there.

1216
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:03,167
Oh, you got a stain too.

1217
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:07,173
- We're blood brothers.
- Shut the fuck up.

1218
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:09,906
You're in my house,
you answer my questions.

1219
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:12,017
What were you doing
dancing with Jacinda?

1220
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:15,984
I don't even dance. I just...

1221
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,715
I don't even dance ever, so...
I've never even tried it.

1222
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,588
Then where the hell did this
come from, asshole?

1223
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:25,589
Maybe you and I rubbed up against
each other at some point.

1224
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,769
I don't remember. Maybe it was
some ricochet scenario. I don't know.

1225
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,995
- How am I supposed to know?
- Kick his ass, Mark.

1226
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:32,968
Shut the fuck up, Scarlett.

1227
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:36,537
Where do you get off
dancing with my fiance?

1228
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,044
To some girl.

1229
01:08:58,433 --> 01:08:59,764
Talk about the hurting.

1230
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,445
- Shit.
- All right.

1231
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,097
- Yo! Fight!
- Move it!

1232
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,034
- Go, check this out!
- Oh, fuck!

1233
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,208
And what the hell is this?

1234
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,008
- I don't fucking... It's detergent.
- Yeah, what are you doing with it?

1235
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,807
I got fucking blood on my pants.

1236
01:09:49,017 --> 01:09:50,541
Get down.

1237
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:54,988
What the fuck is this all about, man?
Are you...?

1238
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:59,357
- Well, fuck me.
- Fellas.

1239
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:02,897
Oh, shit,
I've been tackled by little girls!

1240
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,190
You die! You're next!

1241
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:11,702
I should fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

1242
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:15,866
- Hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him!
- What do you mean? No. No way!

1243
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,807
- You humiliated me!
- I'm sorry!

1244
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:21,574
- You used my leg as a tampon!
- I'm calling the cops.

1245
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:26,482
Evan! Come on! Move!

1246
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,350
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1247
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,722
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.

1248
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,659
Mark, I called the cops.
You should hide your gun.

1249
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:38,490
You're a fucking pussy.

1250
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,928
Don't listen to him, officer.

1251
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,569
If you make this,
we're no longer friends, Michaels.

1252
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:45,204
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Cheating. You're cheating.

1253
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:51,005
- Fuck me.
- Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!

1254
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,044
All right, you...
That was a lucky shot.

1255
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:56,411
- That was a lucky shot.
- I rule.

1256
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:57,846
I got jizzed on. All right.

1257
01:10:58,086 --> 01:11:00,111
- Can I shoot one?
- Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.

1258
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,789
Have a good time, man.

1259
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,891
Empty the clip.
Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!

1260
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:09,052
The cops! Bail! Bail! Bail!
Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!

1261
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,864
Shotgun.

1262
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:23,836
- What a rush.
- What do you guys wanna do?

1263
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,480
- Man, let's get drunk!
- Let's get more fucked up!

1264
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:28,774
You're fucking living the dream,
Michaels!

1265
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:29,951
Oh, man.

1266
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,881
This is gonna be the best night ever.

1267
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,521
<i>- Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview.
- Shit.</i>

1268
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,089
<i>All units in the area report
to Fifth and Paysview.</i>

1269
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:39,590
<i>- Car 98, that's you. Do it.
- Fuck.</i>

1270
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,854
- Shit.
- Shit.

1271
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,329
Car 98 on it.
You dumb fucking whore.

1272
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,526
Hey, did she say we're gonna get
to shoot somebody or something?

1273
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,034
Oh, God, I wish.

1274
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,639
It's probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?

1275
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,139
Yeah, man.
Let's show these fuckers how we roll!

1276
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,455
- You fucking prick.
- What?

1277
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,335
- You bailed on me.
- I didn't bail on you.

1278
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:23,595
Yeah, you did.

1279
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:26,638
You said you were gonna
do something and you didn't do it.

1280
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:27,968
That's bailing.

1281
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:31,407
You're the one that dragged me to
that fucking party with those lunatics.

1282
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:36,573
- I didn't bail on you.
- You bailed on me, okay?

1283
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,185
You bailed on me this morning
when Jesse spat on me...

1284
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:41,014
...and you're bailing on me
next year.

1285
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,283
What the fuck? It finally comes out.
That's good, man.

1286
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,427
We were supposed to go
to college together.

1287
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:48,720
Since we were kids,
since elementary school...

1288
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,364
...that's all we've ever talked about,
us going together.

1289
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:53,193
And you got into
fucking Dartmouth.

1290
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,392
You're making me feel
like I'm a bad guy.

1291
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,539
What...? I didn't do anything wrong.
I got into a good school.

1292
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:02,470
How the fuck am I supposed to get
into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.

1293
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,178
How fucking selfish are you?

1294
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:06,404
You had no problem letting Fogell
take the fall.

1295
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,583
You don't want me going
to a good school.

1296
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:10,774
- Fuck, man!
- So, what the fuck do you want?

1297
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,511
I'm not gonna let you
slow me down anymore, Seth.

1298
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:17,749
What are you saying?

1299
01:13:18,493 --> 01:13:22,190
I've wasted the last three years
sitting around talking bullshit with you.

1300
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,365
Instead of chasing girls
and making friends...

1301
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,558
...l've just sat around
wasting all my time with you.

1302
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:30,363
And now I'm going to college
a fucking friendless virgin.

1303
01:13:30,605 --> 01:13:34,063
Is this about Becca?
This is about some girl, man?

1304
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,709
- I like her!
- Who gives a fuck?

1305
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,072
She's some fucking girl!
You gonna go out with her?

1306
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,771
- What about after that?
- Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.

1307
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:44,047
Fuck you! And next time
you're pissed off about something...

1308
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:47,085
...don't keep it inside for 10 years,
say it like a fucking man!

1309
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,256
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck you!

1310
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:53,727
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers
on your side odd or even?

1311
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,660
- I don't know. It's too dark to see.
- We got flashlights.

1312
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,629
Oh, that's true.

1313
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,205
Where the fuck are we?

1314
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,044
- Hey, Slater.
- What's that?

1315
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,007
Slater.

1316
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:19,046
Now, young Michaels, you will die.

1317
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,955
All right. Come on, stop it.
I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.

1318
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,956
- Like it?
- Hey, fuck off, that hurts.

1319
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,890
- You stop first.
- Not until you stop.

1320
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,723
- Stop it, asshole.
- Hey, you stop.

1321
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,824
- Fuck you, Evan!
- Don't fucking touch me.

1322
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:45,838
Why did you do that?

1323
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:48,208
- You shined the light in my face.
- You did too.

1324
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,441
- I'm driving.
- We were playing Lightsabers.

1325
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,677
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

1326
01:14:52,887 --> 01:14:55,287
Are you guys gonna make sure
he's okay?

1327
01:14:58,526 --> 01:14:59,788
- Check on him.
- You check.

1328
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:03,453
- You go out there and check on him.
- Fuck that. You go.

1329
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,999
Balls. Okay, we'll both go out there
and check on him.

1330
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,338
I can't believe this is happening again.
What are the odds?

1331
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:14,501
Fuck.

1332
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:22,210
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're great, thanks.

1333
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,877
Hey, hey, where's the love?

1334
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:31,548
- He's okay. He's fine.
- Stand right next to your friend.

1335
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,591
- Get over there.
- I got them.

1336
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,126
You got these guys?

1337
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,835
You boys doing
a bit of drinking tonight?

1338
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,169
- No, officer. Not at all. Not... We...
- We found those.

1339
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:49,502
I don't believe you.

1340
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,342
Freeze. Stand right there.

1341
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,609
- We're telling the truth.
- Keep it going.

1342
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,151
- Don't be a hero tonight, guys.
- Wrong night for that.

1343
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:01,913
You gotta fucking take care of this.

1344
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:06,184
No. Look, I am not fixing your mistakes
again, okay? Fuck that shit.

1345
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,692
I don't wanna get shitcanned.
I like this job.

1346
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,161
Me too. I get free haircuts.
I'm not taking the fall.

1347
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,993
Okay, okay!

1348
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:16,163
We're gonna arrest
these two little dipshits, okay?

1349
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,100
And we're gonna pin it on them.

1350
01:16:18,773 --> 01:16:20,240
Yeah, do what you have to do.

1351
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,773
Spread your shit!

1352
01:16:27,982 --> 01:16:31,008
Get on the ground!
Loaded gun, ready to go!

1353
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,813
Spread your shit!
Pussies on the pavement, fellas.

1354
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,217
- Come on!
- Please don't shoot, sir.

1355
01:16:36,424 --> 01:16:39,018
"Please don't shoot."
Shut up and spread your shit!

1356
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:43,496
I am the law! Okay?

1357
01:16:43,698 --> 01:16:44,824
Now hold hands.

1358
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,432
- What?
- Why?

1359
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:50,229
You don't want an asshole where your
face used to be, Whaling Jennings.

1360
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,838
- Hold his fucking hand!
- Fucking hold my hand.

1361
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,407
There. That's not so hard, is it?

1362
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,044
Here, McLovin, have a cigarette.

1363
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,043
Smoke up. Life's short, you know.

1364
01:17:01,816 --> 01:17:03,807
Suck it in, my friend.

1365
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:06,578
Suck it long and deep.

1366
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,278
Enjoy it.

1367
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,450
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.

1368
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:18,160
- You like Officer Slater and myself?
- Yeah, you guys are awesome.

1369
01:17:18,366 --> 01:17:21,494
Thanks.
We really like you too, McLovin.

1370
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,261
So here's what's about to happen.

1371
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:24,904
We're gonna arrest these guys...

1372
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:28,667
...you're gonna write a witness report
saying they leapt in front of our car...

1373
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:31,209
...and there was nothing we could do.
Sound cool?

1374
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,381
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.

1375
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,881
That's good.
Pretend he's your little sister.

1376
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,077
<i>Your little sister with the...</i>

1377
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:51,989
What the fuck?

1378
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,903
Fagell?

1379
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,214
- Shit!
- Shit!

1380
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,594
Run! Run!

1381
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:24,025
Wait.

1382
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,633
Hold on, I gotta get all the booze.
Seth, wait up!

1383
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,497
McLovin bailed!

1384
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:31,763
Chase the kid!

1385
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,472
Stop!

1386
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,529
That was a fast kid.

1387
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:10,644
I want a ride! You hear me?
You can't unarrest me!

1388
01:19:13,147 --> 01:19:14,637
Stop!

1389
01:19:16,784 --> 01:19:20,686
- McLovin!
- Come on.

1390
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:23,817
McLovin!

1391
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,323
McLovin! Why?

1392
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,322
McLovin, come back!

1393
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:37,227
My hand! Monster!
Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.

1394
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,929
- Get Daddy.
- Get Daddy!

1395
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:42,735
- Oh, shit.
- Get away from my kids!

1396
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:48,208
You sick sons of bitches!

1397
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,709
What the fuck?

1398
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,927
Michaels, are you okay?

1399
01:20:01,162 --> 01:20:02,925
- It's just beer.
- Give me a break.

1400
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,723
- It's just beer.
- Man up.

1401
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,525
What happened?
What, did you lose him?

1402
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:09,498
He's a freak.
He's the fastest kid alive.

1403
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:12,229
- This is not good.
- He's the fastest kid alive.

1404
01:20:12,473 --> 01:20:15,499
Fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on.
What are we gonna do?

1405
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:17,710
I'll shoot my gun in the air.

1406
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,880
Give me a fucking warning
before you do it.

1407
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,049
I'll scare him out of wherever
he's hiding.

1408
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,912
This isn't gonna do shit.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

1409
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:26,950
This is your fault, you piece of...

1410
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:29,888
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
They shot Seth.

1411
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,218
They fucking shot Seth, I know it.

1412
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,189
Holy shit.

1413
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,384
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1414
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,090
- Should I run?
- Yes.

1415
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:44,930
- Fuck. Stop!
- Stop the bus!

1416
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:46,572
- Stop it!
- It's stopping.

1417
01:20:46,774 --> 01:20:48,935
- It's stopping.
- Oh, thank God.

1418
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,943
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.

1419
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:57,284
That's me and him.

1420
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,913
Hey, hey. It's you.

1421
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,351
McMuffin.

1422
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,123
- You know this guy?
- It's...

1423
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:09,353
Ain't got no cop people to help you
keep your booze now, do you?

1424
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,897
Hey! Back the fuck up, man,
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

1425
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,160
<i>- Give me the booze.
- Hey! Back the fuck up.</i>

1426
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,567
<i>Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.</i>

1427
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,434
Please, please, calm down, sir.

1428
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:34,953
Goldslick.

1429
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,494
Get off the bus
or I'm calling the cops.

1430
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:57,268
Eat shit, bum.

1431
01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:59,738
Oh, shit, guys.
We're three blocks away, man.

1432
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:02,347
We made it. We made it
with the booze and everything.

1433
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,881
We made it.

1434
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,518
Hold this.

1435
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,779
I can't believe
you still have the liquor.

1436
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:10,882
It's awesome.

1437
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,152
Yeah, I told you the idea would work.
I fooled those cops.

1438
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:17,364
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.

1439
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:20,632
Why do you guys have detergent?

1440
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,804
I don't understand why you were
smoking cigarettes with those cops.

1441
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,632
Because I fucking rule.

1442
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,139
- We are so gonna get laid tonight.
- I am. I'm gonna get laid.

1443
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:31,743
We're finally gonna
get our drinks on.

1444
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,610
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.

1445
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,182
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1446
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,286
I thought you didn't need it.
You were gonna tell her how you feel.

1447
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,013
Good luck getting Jules drunk enough
to have sex with you.

1448
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:45,158
- What's wrong with you guys?
- Nothing.

1449
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,522
You two femmes can talk about it
next year at your little slumber party.

1450
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,425
Oh, you told him.

1451
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,259
- Told me what?
- Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

1452
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,265
- Well, we gotta tell him now.
- No, we...

1453
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,937
Well, he knows something's up.

1454
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:59,435
What are you guys talking about?
Tell me now.

1455
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:01,835
Seth, me and Evan are
rooming together next year.

1456
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,032
What's the big deal?

1457
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,178
"Oh, my God,
Fogell's rooming with Evan."

1458
01:23:05,379 --> 01:23:07,074
Jeez, why don't you go cry about it?

1459
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:09,715
- I didn't tell you because...
- You're a backstabber...

1460
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:13,148
...and you lied to your best friend
and you just don't care anymore?

1461
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:15,549
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.

1462
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:17,183
Not from you.

1463
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:19,586
Give me that booze, Fagell.

1464
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,333
We never should have had to hide
our arrangement.

1465
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,842
- Seth's here.
- Seth, you're here.

1466
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:41,777
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.

1467
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,167
- Evan.
- Gaby, hey.

1468
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,241
Where have you been?
You almost blew it.

1469
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,969
- What are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been waiting.

1470
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,477
She's over there.

1471
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,646
She's way smashed.

1472
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,149
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

1473
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,150
Really? What was she saying?

1474
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,448
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

1475
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,217
No, no.
She said something more like:

1476
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,952
"I will fully blow him tonight."

1477
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,528
- What?
- I know.

1478
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:36,199
- Yeah.
- But she's totally hammered...

1479
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:39,306
...and if I get with her
and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?

1480
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:41,541
Not if you're drunk too.

1481
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:44,243
I guess not.

1482
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,777
To Seth.

1483
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:48,176
- To Seth!
- All right.

1484
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,248
Who the fuck is Seth?

1485
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,147
I'm Seth!

1486
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,085
Let's do another one to me.

1487
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,727
Oh, boy.

1488
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,530
Calm down. Calm down, man.

1489
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,799
Calm down. She likes you.

1490
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:16,406
She wants to suck on your penis.

1491
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,272
It's a good thing.

1492
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,143
It's the best thing.

1493
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,612
Just down the hatch.

1494
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,347
Fogell. What's up?

1495
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,627
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.

1496
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,231
Can you please help me up?

1497
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,994
I fell down and none of these assholes
will help me up.

1498
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,764
- Shit.
- Becca.

1499
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:54,066
I have been waiting for you
for, like, ever.

1500
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,244
- What took you so long?
- I know, it...

1501
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,878
- Do you have my Goldslick?
- No, I can't even...

1502
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,741
It's such a crazy story, okay?

1503
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:04,248
- I swear I was try...
- It doesn't even matter.

1504
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,943
Look. Look what we...
We can just drink this.

1505
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,419
- Here. You could have a drink.
- Oh, no.

1506
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,615
- I'm already pretty wasted.
- Take a drink.

1507
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,192
Okay, here's to you.
This is to Becca.

1508
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:15,488
To Becca.

1509
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:18,029
- To the respecting...
- Guys.

1510
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,293
- Women.
To people respecting women.

1511
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:24,495
Okay. Yeah.

1512
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:28,170
You're a lightweight.

1513
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:30,909
Hey.

1514
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:35,212
You and me,
we should go upstairs, because...

1515
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:39,547
Because I need to
tell you something. Okay?

1516
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,282
<i>You could just tell me here,
I mean...</i>

1517
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:47,223
I can't tell you, because
it's a secret for you from me.

1518
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,488
- All right.
- So come. Come on. Okay.

1519
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:50,858
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

1520
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:53,261
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1521
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:01,972
You changed your name
to McLovin?

1522
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,473
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

1523
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:10,549
So, like, what's Hawaii like?

1524
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:12,584
All right. I am back.

1525
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:15,051
I had to thank the peeps
for coming out, you know.

1526
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:17,748
Jules. I want you
to have a drink with me.

1527
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,325
Just drink some of this.
You're gonna love it.

1528
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:22,325
You're to...
I know you're gonna love it.

1529
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:26,091
- You know, l...
- It's green beer. For your information.

1530
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,929
You know, I'm actually good
right now. But thank you.

1531
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:32,635
And thank you very much
for bringing everything, again.

1532
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,468
Seriously, it really made the night.

1533
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:37,440
No, that's how I roll.
That's the thing.

1534
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:40,479
It's no problems. You'll learn that.

1535
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:50,918
I love talking
and conversing with you.

1536
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:54,118
But I can't hear you, though,
because the music is so loud.

1537
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,492
So do you wanna go outside
and talk more?

1538
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,996
Yeah. Sorry, sure.
You know, why not?

1539
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:05,172
Let's do it.
I haven't conversed in ages.

1540
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:08,831
- Okay. Ladies... Ladies first.
- Okay.

1541
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,879
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1542
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,480
- Watch your step. I fell earlier today.
- You serious?

1543
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,776
Well, I was hit by a car.
It's a long story.

1544
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,083
<i>- Oh, shit. Careful.
- Okay, well...</i>

1545
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,387
So loud. Don't let the parents hear.

1546
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,892
You look so pretty.

1547
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:35,397
- Are you okay?
- I so flirt with you in math.

1548
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,730
Tell me about it. L... Samesies.

1549
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:43,468
I've wanted to tell you for so long
that you're the best girl.

1550
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:48,581
I know. I've wanted to get with you,
like, so hard.

1551
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:52,517
Like so hard.

1552
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,360
You're the best.

1553
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:04,089
We'll take this sweater off. I think so.

1554
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:07,530
Just be careful, because it's a
meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.

1555
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:08,794
Okay.

1556
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,404
- Bought it at that vintage market.
- Just hurry.

1557
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,432
- And this one.
- It's off.

1558
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,736
Hey, wait, careful.

1559
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,437
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

1560
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:21,842
Put that there.

1561
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,745
- Now, looky, looky...
- Okay.

1562
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:26,512
...what I got for you under here.
- Oh, my gosh.

1563
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,518
You are the prettiest girl...

1564
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:31,624
...this side of the Mississippi.
- I have a little something...

1565
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:34,693
...for you under here.

1566
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:35,920
You look so pretty.

1567
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:38,696
- Look so pretty.
- Under there.

1568
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,731
Hello.

1569
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,028
For you.

1570
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:53,080
You're the best. You're so unique.

1571
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,748
Come here.

1572
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,281
Evan, kiss me.

1573
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,416
I like you so much.

1574
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,353
Come on, McLovin.

1575
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,388
I've never been
with an older guy before.

1576
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,925
Well, it's way better.

1577
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,324
I know, we made some
kick-ass tiramisu earlier.

1578
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:14,059
It was deli... It looked weird.
But it was delicious.

1579
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:21,770
What...? What's wrong?

1580
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:26,005
L... I would prefer
if we would just do that...

1581
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:29,741
...at some other time.

1582
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:33,011
No. There is no other time.
School is up.

1583
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:37,487
- What's wrong with right now?
- Well, I mean, you're... You're drunk.

1584
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:42,095
- You're, like, really, really drunk.
- So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.

1585
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:45,266
Yeah, I'm actually...
I'm not drunk at all.

1586
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:48,027
<i>I don't even drink, so it's...
I mean...</i>

1587
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:52,330
Jules, you drink. You drink.

1588
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,373
Everybody... You...
You had me get liquor, so you drink.

1589
01:31:55,577 --> 01:31:56,601
<i>It's like...</i>

1590
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,144
Well, yeah, because
I'm throwing a party, remember?

1591
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,940
<i>Other people drink
and so I just...</i>

1592
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,640
You...?

1593
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:08,352
You don't wanna, you know?

1594
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,093
Not right now.

1595
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:16,354
You know, not while you're drunk.

1596
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:18,989
But, you know, thank you.

1597
01:32:24,339 --> 01:32:28,867
- Evan. Evan, I'm so wet.
- Oh, yeah.

1598
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:32,376
They said that would happen
in health, when I learned about it.

1599
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1600
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:37,745
- They taught me about...
- Who's down there?

1601
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,180
Yeah, it's your hand.

1602
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:47,459
- Thank you, that's good.
- You have such a smooth cock.

1603
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:49,687
Thank you.
You would too if you were a man.

1604
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,389
But you got such a smooth chest.

1605
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,262
I am gonna give you...

1606
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:59,907
...the best blow-J ever...

1607
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:02,508
...with my mouth.

1608
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,905
Why don't we...?
Why don't we just kiss a while?

1609
01:33:05,113 --> 01:33:08,708
Why don't we keep kissing for a bit,
instead of...?

1610
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:12,176
How badly do you wanna fuck me?

1611
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:14,281
Jesus Christ.

1612
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,056
Jesus, fuck.

1613
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,519
- Hang on one second.
- What?

1614
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,454
Becca,
I don't think you wanna do this.

1615
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:23,563
- You're really drunk.
- No, I'm not. I am not drunk.

1616
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:27,929
- I see that you are. I think you are.
- And I really... I want you inside me.

1617
01:33:28,136 --> 01:33:30,366
I want you to be my first.
I want you inside me.

1618
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:32,767
So just... Just go with it.

1619
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,908
<i>- Let it happen.
- I know, but...</i>

1620
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,401
Becca, this is kind of intense.

1621
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,946
And I just... I'm so drunk.
I can't even, like, process this.

1622
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,482
And you're really pretty.

1623
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:46,745
And I just think
this isn't how I pictured it.

1624
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:51,392
I don't understand why you have to be
such a little bitch about it.

1625
01:33:52,594 --> 01:33:55,722
- Did you just call me a bitch?
- Yes, a scared...

1626
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:58,524
See, I, like,
I think we're not thinking clear...

1627
01:33:58,733 --> 01:33:59,995
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1628
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:02,567
- Go get Gaby.
- I'll go get her.

1629
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:07,503
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Go get Gaby, please.

1630
01:34:21,723 --> 01:34:25,352
- I got a boner.
- Good.

1631
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,255
- Do you have a condom?
- Yes.

1632
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,167
And lube.

1633
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:34,858
Seth?

1634
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,274
Are...? Are you crying?

1635
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:44,543
No, I just have something
in both my eyes.

1636
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:45,906
I don't cry. That's funny.

1637
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:48,344
You look... You look...
It looks like you're crying.

1638
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:49,880
<i>So...</i>

1639
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,452
It was my last chance
and I fucked it up and...

1640
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:56,214
Your last chance to do what?

1641
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,450
To make you
my girlfriend for the summer.

1642
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:02,894
You're, like, the coolest person
that's ever talked to me.

1643
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,689
I thought we'd both be drunk.

1644
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,629
What does me being drunk
have anything to do with it?

1645
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,133
You'd never get with me
if you were sober.

1646
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:11,805
Look at you.

1647
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:17,072
- Look at me.
- Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.

1648
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,271
I think maybe...

1649
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:21,677
What the fuck?!

1650
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,544
Help me.

1651
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:26,720
Shirley.

1652
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,980
I'm sorry.

1653
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,280
I'm sorry.

1654
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:31,181
- Someone forgot to call pest control.
- Yep.

1655
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,224
Where you going?
Hey, party's still on.

1656
01:35:33,428 --> 01:35:34,656
- Where are you going?
- No.

1657
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:38,060
If you're back there, get out.
Everyone, come on.

1658
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:40,029
- We will shoot you.
- Party's over.

1659
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:41,725
- Evan.
- Get the hell out of here.

1660
01:35:41,937 --> 01:35:43,598
Keep your hands up.

1661
01:35:49,378 --> 01:35:52,074
Life's bullshit, Miroki.

1662
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:03,424
Ev, wake the fuck up, man.

1663
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,923
We gotta go.
Those fucking cops are here, man.

1664
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:11,529
"Oh, no, it's the cops."
We have a complaint.

1665
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:14,258
- Evan, come on.
- Get the hell out of here right now.

1666
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:16,096
Get out of here.
She's not interested.

1667
01:36:16,304 --> 01:36:19,000
- Drop the crantini and move it, sister.
- See you, sugar tits.

1668
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,174
Guys, come on, move.

1669
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:23,503
Everybody out.
Leave the booze and go.

1670
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:25,873
What the fuck, man?

1671
01:36:26,681 --> 01:36:27,943
What the fuck, Seth?

1672
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,380
He's my best friend. Oh, shit.

1673
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:33,386
Oh, shit. Come on.

1674
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:36,216
I assume you all have guns
and crack.

1675
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,691
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.

1676
01:36:45,267 --> 01:36:46,632
Okay, everyone...

1677
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:49,668
...prepare to be fucked
by the long dick of the law.

1678
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:51,634
Get out.

1679
01:36:53,442 --> 01:36:54,431
Come on, go.

1680
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,238
Fuck off, Seth.

1681
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:04,012
Get a room.

1682
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:06,619
I'm gonna save you.
I'm gonna save you, Evan.

1683
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:09,917
Fuck.

1684
01:37:11,593 --> 01:37:14,790
Fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.

1685
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,512
It's in. Oh, my God, it's in.

1686
01:37:32,714 --> 01:37:35,080
All right, everybody out.
Come on, let's go.

1687
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:37,649
McLovin! What the fuck?

1688
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:40,219
- Officer Slater, is that you?
- You ran away from us.

1689
01:37:40,422 --> 01:37:42,390
Why did you run away?
Michaels, get up here.

1690
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:44,525
- No. I didn't run away.
- What the fuck?

1691
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:45,715
Why would you do that?

1692
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:48,418
- I was disoriented from...
- Were you violating that girl?

1693
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,030
You just violated her with your penis?
Michaels, look.

1694
01:37:51,233 --> 01:37:52,598
- McLovin?
- No, no, no.

1695
01:37:53,168 --> 01:37:54,658
No.

1696
01:37:55,303 --> 01:37:57,100
Holy shit.
Were you just getting laid?

1697
01:37:57,305 --> 01:37:59,967
No. Yeah, I was, but...

1698
01:38:00,175 --> 01:38:02,439
- Yes, yes, he was.
- It's not what you think, guys.

1699
01:38:02,644 --> 01:38:04,839
- I'm not even...
- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.

1700
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:06,877
- Calm down.
- I thought we were friends...

1701
01:38:07,082 --> 01:38:08,549
...and then you go running away.

1702
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,377
Contain yourself.

1703
01:38:10,585 --> 01:38:12,075
- We're friends.
- Shut up.

1704
01:38:12,287 --> 01:38:14,551
- Calm down. Calm down, man.
- Why? What?

1705
01:38:14,756 --> 01:38:16,348
You just cock-blocked McLovin.
Okay?

1706
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,048
He's our friend. We don't do that.

1707
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:21,593
We should be guiding his cock,
not blocking it.

1708
01:38:21,796 --> 01:38:25,527
Just relax, okay?
Let's make this right.

1709
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:35,472
Wait, what are you...?
What are you guys doing?

1710
01:38:35,677 --> 01:38:38,874
No, please, I can't... I can't go to jail.
Please, I can't go to jail.

1711
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,880
No, look.
We're really sorry, McLovin.

1712
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,417
This has... This has gone on...
This has gone way too far.

1713
01:38:46,621 --> 01:38:49,681
What? What are you talking about?

1714
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:53,827
We know you're not 25, man.
We're not idiots, McLovin.

1715
01:38:54,029 --> 01:38:56,520
- Yeah.
- Did you know the whole time?

1716
01:38:56,731 --> 01:39:01,896
Look, when we were your age,
we hated cops.

1717
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:05,266
<i>When we saw you
in the liquor store today, we just...</i>

1718
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:07,532
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves,
you know...

1719
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:10,836
...and we just wanted
to show you that...

1720
01:39:11,046 --> 01:39:13,412
...you know, cops can have
a fun time too, you know?

1721
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:15,207
Yeah.

1722
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:20,512
You know, in a way,
I think we wanted to show ourselves.

1723
01:39:22,257 --> 01:39:24,589
<i>Also, I'm...</i>

1724
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,921
I'm really sorry
that I blocked your cock.

1725
01:39:28,597 --> 01:39:31,725
- Apology accepted.
- Seriously, man.

1726
01:39:32,767 --> 01:39:34,325
That feels good.

1727
01:39:34,536 --> 01:39:36,401
- It feels so good.
- I missed you guys.

1728
01:39:36,605 --> 01:39:38,971
I just wish we could
make it up to you somehow, man.

1729
01:39:39,174 --> 01:39:41,802
Well, do you think
you can do me a really big favor?

1730
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:44,069
- What is it? Anything.
- Name it.

1731
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:47,305
- This kid's fucking crazy.
- Stay back for your own safety.

1732
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:49,813
Get off me, you fucking cops.
Get your hands off.

1733
01:39:50,018 --> 01:39:52,543
Do you know who I am?
I'm Fogell.

1734
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:56,822
- The joint can't hold me.
- Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.

1735
01:39:57,025 --> 01:39:59,994
I'm gonna break your glasses,
you fucking cop. You can't hold me.

1736
01:40:00,195 --> 01:40:01,287
Fucking pigs.

1737
01:40:06,268 --> 01:40:07,462
Oh, shit.

1738
01:40:10,071 --> 01:40:11,663
Nice mullet, asshole.

1739
01:40:12,307 --> 01:40:14,172
- You crazy.
- This kid's crazy.

1740
01:40:14,376 --> 01:40:17,436
He's nuts.
Well, we caught the infamous Fogell.

1741
01:40:17,646 --> 01:40:19,273
Get your hands...
Wait for me, Nicola.

1742
01:40:19,481 --> 01:40:20,914
Wait for me on the outside.

1743
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,977
We were gonna go to Hawaii.

1744
01:40:25,086 --> 01:40:26,781
Man, that's gonna get you
so much ass.

1745
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:27,955
Seriously?

1746
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,353
- I know what to do about the car.
- Sweet.

1747
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:35,589
Fucking go. Fucking throw up.

1748
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:40,832
Are you carrying me?

1749
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,163
No, I'm saving you from the cops.

1750
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:44,527
You saved me?

1751
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:49,309
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about, but thanks.

1752
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,638
Can l... Should I just walk?

1753
01:40:51,846 --> 01:40:55,373
- Should I walk?
- Yeah, sure.

1754
01:40:56,151 --> 01:41:00,144
- Okay.
- Where do you wanna go?

1755
01:41:00,989 --> 01:41:04,117
Sleepover at my house?
You wanna come sleep...?

1756
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:08,796
- Okay.
- Okay.

1757
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:13,561
Does your mom
still have pizza bagels?

1758
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:15,395
Yeah. Lots.

1759
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:17,537
Pizza bagels.

1760
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:28,374
So by signing this,
you are officially saying...

1761
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:31,017
...that as we stopped you
from being mugged...

1762
01:41:31,219 --> 01:41:34,120
...a crackhead stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.

1763
01:41:34,322 --> 01:41:36,916
- You cool to sign that?
- Of course. I owe you guys my life.

1764
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,719
We owe you, Mc...
Wait, what's your real name again?

1765
01:41:39,928 --> 01:41:40,952
- Fogell.
- Fuck that.

1766
01:41:41,162 --> 01:41:43,722
- We're calling you McLovin.
- McLovin.

1767
01:41:43,932 --> 01:41:46,332
Let's do this dance, boys.

1768
01:42:09,924 --> 01:42:12,586
- Oh, my God.
- What did I tell you guys, right?

1769
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:13,761
That was crazy.

1770
01:42:19,768 --> 01:42:20,962
All right.

1771
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:23,103
All right, now, guys, check this out.

1772
01:42:23,304 --> 01:42:26,501
It's probably the greatest move
in doughnut-spinning history.

1773
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:27,697
You paying attention?

1774
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:31,174
Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.

1775
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:34,644
- Why is it called that?
- I don't know.

1776
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,913
Make the badge proud, Slater.

1777
01:42:42,924 --> 01:42:45,085
He's not usually this drunk
when he does this...

1778
01:42:45,293 --> 01:42:48,421
...but I think
that could make it more cool.

1779
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:55,264
McLovin!

1780
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,838
Oh, no.

1781
01:43:07,649 --> 01:43:08,980
Fuck.

1782
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:18,757
- Slater!
- Officer Slater.

1783
01:43:20,562 --> 01:43:23,497
All right. Fucking crazy.

1784
01:43:24,299 --> 01:43:25,266
Let's do this.

1785
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:30,298
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go.
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1786
01:43:30,505 --> 01:43:32,666
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here we go, here we go.

1787
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,967
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

1788
01:43:35,176 --> 01:43:37,770
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.

1789
01:43:42,951 --> 01:43:46,443
Yes. Oh, my God.

1790
01:43:46,654 --> 01:43:49,054
It worked. It worked.

1791
01:43:49,257 --> 01:43:53,193
We won. We won.

1792
01:44:01,803 --> 01:44:03,703
Can we shoot at it?

1793
01:44:04,873 --> 01:44:08,001
I don't know. Can you?

1794
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:28,523
Break yourself, fool.

1795
01:44:34,903 --> 01:44:36,393
Tight.

1796
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,198
Listen, and then she said
she was gonna give me a blow-J.

1797
01:44:39,407 --> 01:44:43,138
- I can't believe she said that to you.
- Man, you have no idea.

1798
01:44:43,344 --> 01:44:46,211
- What was she thinking?
- You don't even know.

1799
01:44:54,022 --> 01:44:58,015
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

1800
01:44:58,226 --> 01:44:59,557
What?

1801
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:01,626
I was in your room, like,
three weeks ago...

1802
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:04,059
...while you were taking a shit.

1803
01:45:04,265 --> 01:45:09,259
And I saw your housing, like, forms.

1804
01:45:09,771 --> 01:45:13,969
So I knew you and Fogell
were gonna live together, you know.

1805
01:45:14,175 --> 01:45:16,735
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

1806
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:22,876
I should've told you.
I don't know why I didn't.

1807
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:25,814
Don't... No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

1808
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,750
I was being a dick.
I was being a big dick to you.

1809
01:45:28,957 --> 01:45:30,185
No, l...

1810
01:45:30,391 --> 01:45:34,794
Listen, Seth, I want you to know,
I don't wanna live with Fogell.

1811
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:39,956
I never wanted to live with him.
I just don't... I ha...

1812
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:42,329
I'm afraid to live with strangers.

1813
01:45:44,205 --> 01:45:45,331
I can't.

1814
01:45:46,441 --> 01:45:48,409
I can't do it.

1815
01:45:49,811 --> 01:45:52,541
I know, I know.

1816
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:56,715
I can't believe you saved me.

1817
01:45:58,386 --> 01:46:00,513
You saved me.

1818
01:46:00,722 --> 01:46:03,623
I can't believe. I owe you so...

1819
01:46:04,492 --> 01:46:08,622
You carried me. I love you.

1820
01:46:09,263 --> 01:46:10,696
I love you, man.

1821
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:15,693
I love you.

1822
01:46:17,138 --> 01:46:21,768
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just...

1823
01:46:21,976 --> 01:46:23,944
I lo... I love you.

1824
01:46:24,145 --> 01:46:25,806
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

1825
01:46:26,014 --> 01:46:27,481
I love you.

1826
01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:30,446
Why don't we say that every day?
Why can't we say it more often?

1827
01:46:30,652 --> 01:46:32,882
I just love you. I just wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

1828
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:34,384
"I love my best friend, Evan."

1829
01:46:34,589 --> 01:46:38,218
- We should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

1830
01:46:38,426 --> 01:46:44,228
Like, when you went away for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

1831
01:46:44,432 --> 01:46:47,890
- I missed you too.
- I want the world to know.

1832
01:46:48,336 --> 01:46:53,000
It's... It's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

1833
01:46:56,611 --> 01:47:00,138
Come here. Come here, man.

1834
01:47:10,825 --> 01:47:13,350
- I love you.
- I love you.

1835
01:47:25,374 --> 01:47:27,433
What the fuck?

1836
01:47:34,817 --> 01:47:39,811
- What up?
- Morning. Morning.

1837
01:47:40,289 --> 01:47:42,780
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

1838
01:47:42,991 --> 01:47:45,186
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

1839
01:47:45,394 --> 01:47:48,363
Yeah, you don't...
I mean, you don't have to, you know.

1840
01:47:48,564 --> 01:47:51,624
I don't really have anything
going on.

1841
01:47:51,834 --> 01:47:54,359
You don't have to rush off like that.

1842
01:47:57,873 --> 01:47:59,898
You wanna hang out?

1843
01:48:00,342 --> 01:48:02,776
I was gonna go to the mall.

1844
01:48:02,978 --> 01:48:06,414
I have to get a new comforter.

1845
01:48:07,049 --> 01:48:09,540
For college.
The mall, they would sell that.

1846
01:48:09,752 --> 01:48:11,310
Cool. So...

1847
01:48:12,688 --> 01:48:14,952
...your mom's got huge tits.

1848
01:48:17,593 --> 01:48:18,855
What do you think?

1849
01:48:19,061 --> 01:48:20,426
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.

1850
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:23,393
Because I don't give a shit
how pants look.

1851
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:25,965
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

1852
01:48:26,168 --> 01:48:29,501
Those are too tight.
Those are way too tight.

1853
01:48:29,705 --> 01:48:32,173
- Yeah, but, like...
- Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

1854
01:48:32,374 --> 01:48:34,934
There's not enough pants where
there should be. More pants.

1855
01:48:35,144 --> 01:48:37,510
Yeah, but...
I mean, does it look weird?

1856
01:48:37,713 --> 01:48:41,080
Looks like you're standing funny. You
wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.

1857
01:48:41,283 --> 01:48:43,046
Yeah, but I'm doing like...

1858
01:48:43,252 --> 01:48:46,483
- I'm doing the college poses like...
- I don't know if you are.

1859
01:48:46,688 --> 01:48:48,588
- You might just be doing...
- Hey, prof.

1860
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:50,850
<i>- Okay.
- That test was...</i>

1861
01:48:51,493 --> 01:48:55,361
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

1862
01:48:55,564 --> 01:48:59,125
Yeah, but that's just... It's like I wish
there were more pants where...

1863
01:48:59,368 --> 01:49:00,596
You know, where there aren't.

1864
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:02,701
But when I was wearing
your dad's pants...

1865
01:49:02,905 --> 01:49:05,703
...I realized that if I wear pants
that are a little too small...

1866
01:49:05,908 --> 01:49:07,603
...it might encourage me
to lose weight.

1867
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:09,710
And also,
chicks can kind of see, like...

1868
01:49:09,912 --> 01:49:12,540
...you know, the borders
and outline of my dick a little.

1869
01:49:12,748 --> 01:49:15,717
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

1870
01:49:15,918 --> 01:49:18,910
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...

1871
01:49:19,121 --> 01:49:20,782
I know where it is, where it happens.

1872
01:49:20,989 --> 01:49:22,650
Like, right there.

1873
01:49:22,858 --> 01:49:26,419
It's like they're so tight that one ball is,
like, above my dick, even.

1874
01:49:26,628 --> 01:49:28,323
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

1875
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:31,124
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

1876
01:49:31,333 --> 01:49:32,698
It's like a division sign.

1877
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:34,698
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

1878
01:49:35,637 --> 01:49:39,368
- Making my ass look weird?
- It makes a lot of stuff look weird.

1879
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:41,141
No, those are way too tight.

1880
01:49:41,977 --> 01:49:44,741
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1881
01:49:44,947 --> 01:49:48,212
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

1882
01:49:48,417 --> 01:49:50,476
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a new one.

1883
01:49:50,686 --> 01:49:51,948
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

1884
01:49:52,154 --> 01:49:56,181
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

1885
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:58,882
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

1886
01:49:59,094 --> 01:50:01,892
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
It's them.

1887
01:50:02,798 --> 01:50:06,700
- What the fuck do we do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't know.

1888
01:50:08,537 --> 01:50:10,971
- Hey.
- Hey.

1889
01:50:11,907 --> 01:50:13,602
How's it going?

1890
01:50:15,344 --> 01:50:18,108
It's so good to...
How are you feeling?

1891
01:50:18,747 --> 01:50:22,239
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
How about you?

1892
01:50:23,352 --> 01:50:27,482
I'm okay, you know, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

1893
01:50:30,025 --> 01:50:33,552
You know,
I actually don't remember much.

1894
01:50:33,762 --> 01:50:35,286
I don't remember anything.

1895
01:50:36,198 --> 01:50:39,167
- So weird.
- Nothing.

1896
01:50:39,668 --> 01:50:42,262
I didn't puke on you, did I?

1897
01:50:42,738 --> 01:50:44,968
You didn't.
I remember that you... I avoided it.

1898
01:50:45,173 --> 01:50:49,269
It whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay away from me," you know.

1899
01:50:49,912 --> 01:50:55,851
<i>I'm really sorry about
everything last night, and I just...</i>

1900
01:50:57,519 --> 01:50:59,953
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

1901
01:51:00,856 --> 01:51:02,483
That's okay, you know.

1902
01:51:02,691 --> 01:51:05,285
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

1903
01:51:08,697 --> 01:51:11,825
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

1904
01:51:12,734 --> 01:51:17,034
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

1905
01:51:17,239 --> 01:51:19,969
Everything's great, just from he...
This, just like right there.

1906
01:51:20,175 --> 01:51:21,767
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

1907
01:51:21,977 --> 01:51:23,604
Everything else is great.

1908
01:51:23,812 --> 01:51:27,805
But seriously,
I acted like a fucking idiot last night.

1909
01:51:30,519 --> 01:51:34,717
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

1910
01:51:35,557 --> 01:51:39,357
On the upside,
I think you look cool with a black eye.

1911
01:51:39,561 --> 01:51:42,928
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
I don't... I don't know.

1912
01:51:43,131 --> 01:51:47,124
Well, thank you, smart guy.
Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.

1913
01:51:47,336 --> 01:51:50,635
Because I have to get
a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.

1914
01:51:50,839 --> 01:51:53,273
Oh, man. Fuck.

1915
01:51:53,475 --> 01:51:55,875
And I'm gonna get Jules
a new comforter.

1916
01:51:56,078 --> 01:51:58,012
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

1917
01:51:58,213 --> 01:52:00,738
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

1918
01:52:00,949 --> 01:52:02,849
<i>So, Seth...</i>

1919
01:52:04,186 --> 01:52:08,145
So do you wanna come
buy me cover-up or something?

1920
01:52:08,357 --> 01:52:10,382
I mean, you kind of owe me.

1921
01:52:11,793 --> 01:52:15,160
Yeah, definitely.
I would love to do that.

1922
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:17,530
I had such bad acne last year...

1923
01:52:17,733 --> 01:52:21,100
...that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

1924
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:24,264
<i>Well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...</i>

1925
01:52:24,473 --> 01:52:26,498
Well, so...
Well, I mean, I have my dad's car.

1926
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:29,541
So I could just give you a lift...

1927
01:52:29,745 --> 01:52:31,770
...and then Evan
could take Becca home.

1928
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:34,380
If that works.
I don't know if it's in your route.

1929
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:35,811
It'd be fine with me.

1930
01:52:36,018 --> 01:52:38,782
Fine, yeah.
Maybe we can get some food.

1931
01:52:39,988 --> 01:52:41,250
Yeah, I'd like that.

1932
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,820
So I guess I'll call you, then.

1933
01:52:46,028 --> 01:52:48,019
Yeah, give me a call.
Yeah, you have my number.

1934
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:51,256
I have your information.
So put her there.

1935
01:52:51,466 --> 01:52:54,435
Perfect. Good. All right, man.

1936
01:52:54,636 --> 01:52:56,035
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

1937
01:52:56,238 --> 01:52:57,762
- Becca.
- Bye, guys.

1938
01:52:57,973 --> 01:52:59,531
- Bye, have fun.
- See you, Jules.

1939
01:52:59,741 --> 01:53:02,869
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.

1940
01:53:03,078 --> 01:53:05,569
Where do you wanna go to eat?

1941
01:53:06,948 --> 01:53:10,213
