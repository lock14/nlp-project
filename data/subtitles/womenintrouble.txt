00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,749 
- You gonna do that all night?

3
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,752 
- As long as it takes.

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,713 
- They're gonna hang us
first thing tomorrow.

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,340 
- lt's not tomorrow yet.

6
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,761 
- You mean you still think
the real robbers

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,013 
might come forward?

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,099 
That's a one-in-a-million
chance, Sister.

9
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,060 
- Well, that's still one chance.

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,442 
- You ladies can't sleep,
or what?

11
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,777 
- Capitan.

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,111 
You got to listen to me.

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,446 
We didn't steal them cows.

14
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,781 
lt was Billy Ray and his posse.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,407 
- That's what you say.

16
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,076 
- 'Cause it's true.

17
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,078 
She's never done a bad thing
her whole life.

18
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,372 
She-she's never lied
or drank or smoked.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,249 
- What else have you never done?

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,044 
- l've never been to the rodeo.

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,629 
- What else?

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,548 
- l've never gone
skinny-dippin'.

23
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,717 
Oh.

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,637 
Think harder.

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,306 
- He wants you to say
you've never been with a man.

26
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,266 
- l won't!
- Good girl.

27
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,644 
- 'Cause it ain't true.

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,270 
- But l thought
you were a virgin.

29
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,647 
- Are you kidding me?

30
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,316 
l grew up on a ranch
with six brothers.

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,984 
You get in here,
and l'll prove it.

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,947 
- l guess l can't deny
a prisoner her last wish.

33
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,576 
- Hmm.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,913 
- What about me?

35
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,041 
Nuns have last wishes too.

36
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,793 
- Sorry, Sister.

37
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,086 
You gave yourself to Jesus.

38
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,839 
- True.

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,591 
But now He never calls.

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:24,393 
Lose everything except
the boots, Captain,

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,354 
because tonight we accommodate

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,941 
every single one
of your perversions.

43
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,115 
Mm.

44
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,367 
Oh, shit.

45
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,827 
That's me.
Sorry.

46
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,120 
- Maybe it's Jesus calling.

47
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,707 
- So anyway,
like l was telling you before...

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,125 
- Hello.

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,711 
- Hi, this is Latisha
from Dr. Greenspan's office.

50
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,462 
Am l catching you
at a bad time?

51
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,006 
- No, no, no, Latisha.

52
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,215 
Uh, tell me.

53
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,592 
- Your blood tests are done,

54
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,594 
and the doctor would like
a word with you.

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,179 
- Well, put him on.

56
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,597 
- You need to come
into the office

57
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,265 
so he can tell you in person.

58
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,725 
- l see.

59
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,484 
Now what?

60
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,115 
Holly.

61
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,701 
W- what are you doing sneaking
up behind my car like that?

62
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,911 
- No, it's nothing.

63
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,871 
lt's-uh, it's nothing.
l am-l'm fine.

64
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,247 
- Come over here.

65
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,290 
You sure you're okay?

66
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,750 
l think maybe you have
a concussion.

67
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,585 
- N-n-no, l always take
my contacts out

68
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,754 
before sex, so...

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,797 
But, hey, why are you leaving?

70
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,549 
- lt's just, uh, l...

71
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,592 
l can't talk about it.

72
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,593 
l...

73
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,261 
- l was just really
looking forward

74
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,512 
to eating your pussy.

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,972 
- That's sweet,
but l got to run.

76
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,057 
- But l've been practicing.

77
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,099 
You know,
l've gotten way better.

78
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,100 
- Good to hear.

79
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,393 
Careful with the car now.

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,815 
Holly.

81
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,280 
- That's as straight as it gets.

82
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,740 
- l'm pregnant.

83
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,034 
- lt happens.

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,328 
- Nothing else
you need to tell me?

85
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,288 
- Congratulations.

86
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,207 
- You sure?

87
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,959 
- Plain as day.

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,961 
And don't drink or smoke.

89
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,754 
Take good care of yourself.

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,923 
- That's it?
You swear?

91
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,633 
- You may want to stay
in the shade.

92
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,594 
lt's a scorcher out today.

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,098 
- How can l be pregnant?

94
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,016 
- Are you a virgin?

95
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,059 
- No.

96
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,187 
- Then you can be pregnant.

97
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,592 
- Nick, uh,
it's Elektra.

98
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,885 
We need to talk.

99
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,514 
Uh, will you call me back,
please?

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,934 
lt's-it's really important.

101
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,227 
All right.

102
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,520 
Bye.

103
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,919 
- Honey.

104
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,338 
Ah, you're breaking up.

105
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,464 
l can't-

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,677 
Well, l only sound confused
because l find it confusing.

107
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,179 
That's ridiculous.

108
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,681 
lf she doesn't want to go,
why insist on her going?

109
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,726 
Then who's fighting
the losing battle here?

110
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,728 
Uh-huh, right.

111
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,980 
Right.

112
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,899 
But every daughter
has a strained relationship

113
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,400 
with her mother.

114
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,943 
Yes, they do.

115
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,737 
Look at us with Mom.

116
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,742 
Ugggh.

117
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,910 
Okay.

118
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,412 
You know what?
Your funeral.

119
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,831 
She's gonna be in therapy
about this for years.

120
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,916 
Guaranteed.

121
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,502 
Different therapist,
that's all.

122
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,504 
Honey, l know you're saying
something really mean

123
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,422 
to me right now,
but l just can't hear you.

124
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,840 
You're breaking up.

125
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,801 
l can't hear-

126
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,761 
Call-call-just call me back.

127
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,971 
Call me back.

128
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,314 
Do l always have to have
the last word?

129
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,941 
l don't think so.

130
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,110 
Do you, on the other hand,

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,987 
always make everything
about yourself?

132
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,574 
No doubt about it.

133
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,115 
Uh.

134
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,580 
- l'm stepping into an elevator,
so l might lose you.

135
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,206 
l...

136
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,918 
- Hello?
Doris? Do?

137
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,213 
lt's hard to believe
your aunt and l

138
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,382 
came out of the same womb.

139
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,050 
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying,

140
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,177 
are you, Charlotte?

141
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,512 
- Ten years ago,
it was a privilege to have one.

142
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,514 
Now it's a privilege
not to, huh?

143
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,314 
You're kidding.

144
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:13,450 
d d

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,612 
- Hi.
- Hi, Travis.

146
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,905 
- Hi, Mr. McPherson.

147
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,782 
- You know where to go.
She'll be right with you.

148
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,075 
- l'll be back in an hour.

149
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,035 
- Okeydokey.
- All right.

150
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,579 
- l read your story.

151
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,163 
- You didn't like it.

152
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,456 
- l did.

153
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,208 
You're a very promising writer.

154
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,960 
Your vocabulary
is very impressive.

155
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,253 
- But?

156
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,462 
- No but.

157
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,965 
- You didn't find it too...
dark?

158
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,928 
- Wasn't that the whole point?

159
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,263 
- l guess.

160
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,598 
- l mean, you can see why

161
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,391 
your mom would be worried
about it, can't you?

162
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,393 
- lf she read anything other
than self-help books,

163
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,270 
she might not have been
that shocked.

164
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,272 
- Did she actually use
that word?

165
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,815 
- She's worried
about the witch thing.

166
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,317 
- Yeah.

167
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,985 
So let's talk about that.

168
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,616 
You think you're a witch?

169
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,536 
- l'm not technically a witch,
but my grandmother was,

170
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,830 
so l think
l inherited some of it.

171
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,290 
- Like what?
- Like...

172
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,083 
l can see ghosts.

173
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,668 
- Give me an example.

174
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,629 
- You mind if l smoke?

175
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,923 
- Go ahead.

176
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,354 
- Addy feels really guilty

177
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,314 
about sending
Caterpillar Girl away,

178
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,523 
because l was at summer camp

179
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,025 
when she had
the house exorcised.

180
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,319 
- Your mom had the house
exorcised?

181
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,487 
- She hired this spiritualist

182
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,280 
to come and "cleanse the vibes"
or whatever,

183
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,282 
and Caterpillar Girl
freaked out and left.

184
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,326 
- And who is
this Caterpillar Girl?

185
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,494 
- My friend.

186
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,953 
She was a ghost.

187
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,455 
Is a ghost.

188
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,499 
Wherever she is.

189
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,459 
She died 20 years ago.

190
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,336 
This freak accident
at Rockerland.

191
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,713 
She fell off this roller coaster
called the Caterpillar.

192
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,548 
Her family sued the park,
and they shut it down.

193
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,633 
You can look it up.

194
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,510 
- And she lived in your house?

195
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,516 
- My room was her room.

196
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,771 
- And you're sure she's a ghost
and not an imaginary friend?

197
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,523 
- Apples and oranges.

198
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,984 
l really miss her.

199
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,903 
- What's the difference
between a ghost

200
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,822 
and an imaginary friend?

201
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,074 
- lmaginary friends
you just make up.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,909 
You tell them what to do.

203
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,494 
You can't do that with a ghost.

204
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,707 
They show up, leave,
get bored, annoy you,

205
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,999 
make you laugh.

206
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,084 
- How do they annoy you?

207
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,419 
- They move stuff around.

208
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,003 
And they pull on your feet
when you sleep

209
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,839 
and put your socks
in the fishbowl.

210
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,592 
- What's that chain
you always wear?

211
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,261 
- lt-it's Spanish.

212
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,639 
lt's what l use
to hypnotize people.

213
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,563 
Sometimes l see things,

214
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,940 
stuff that's not the way
it should be.

215
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,402 
But if l tell people about it,
they freak out.

216
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,112 
lf l use this,

217
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,281 
they tell themselves
they're under my spell

218
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,366 
so that they can accept
what l say.

219
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,576 
- Give me an example.

220
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,203 
- You want me to hypnotize you?

221
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,455 
- Let's give it a try.

222
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,750 
- You're Addy-
my mom's therapist.

223
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,835 
- Now l'm your therapist too,
right?

224
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,089 
- All right.

225
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,550 
Look straight into the amulet

226
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,261 
and try not to think
about anything else.

227
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,482 
Do you trust me?

228
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,193 
- Mm-hmm.
Yep.

229
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,780 
- Okay.

230
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,239 
l want you to get up

231
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,825 
and walk into
your husband's office.

232
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,368 
Did you hear me?

233
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,206 
But you won't do it.

234
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,585 
- Sorry.

235
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,795 
This isn't working.

236
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,171 
- That's what you think.

237
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,173 
- Why do you want me to go
into my husband's office?

238
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,591 
- lt's not that l want you to.

239
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,926 
l just...

240
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,886 
l think you're so caught up
in saying

241
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,596 
what you think
people need to hear

242
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,058 
that you can't see what's
right in front of your face.

243
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,019 
- And what would that be?

244
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,231 
- Your husband...

245
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,609 
and my mom having an affair.

246
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,281 
- Now, why would you say
a thing like that?

247
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,533 
- This is a big deal for her.

248
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,326 
She's never done anything
like this before.

249
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,369 
- Stop it.

250
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,703 
- She's following
your own advice

251
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,372 
of acting irresponsible
and letting loose

252
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,665 
for once in her life.

253
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,708 
- Your mom tells you
what we discuss in her sessions?

254
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,126 
- l read her diary.

255
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,628 
Please don't be mad at me.

256
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,797 
- Why are you doing this?

257
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,632 
- l don't want
to be doing anything,

258
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,551 
but it's the truth.

259
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,719 
She drops me off
then parks down the block

260
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,472 
and spends 50 minutes
with Mr. McPherson.

261
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,934 
You're basically the world's
most overqualified babysitter.

262
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,648 
- l need to use the restroom.

263
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,732 
l'll be right back.

264
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,985 
- l'm so sorry, Maxine.

265
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,536 
- Hey, honey.

266
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,371 
- Hey, what's up?

267
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,915 
- Nothing.

268
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208 
You?

269
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,836 
- Nothing.

270
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,421 
- l was just on my way
to the bathroom

271
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,047 
and thought l'd stop by
and say hi.

272
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,090 
- Oh, okay.

273
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,341 
Well, hi.

274
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,928 
We still on for dinner tonight?

275
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,389 
- You bet.

276
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,225 
- Okay.

277
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,774 
- Jesus fucking Paul and Mary.

278
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,192 
- lt's okay.
Nothing happened.

279
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,986 
- What are you, fucking high?
She knows.

280
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,738 
- She doesn't know.
Nothing happened.

281
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,239 
- Nothing happened?

282
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,618 
- Did you make the reservations,
or was l supposed to?

283
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,912 
- Oh, l'll take care of it.

284
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,091 
- You're on the other side
of this door, aren't you, Addy?

285
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,432 
Please don't make me ask again.

286
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,602 
- Honey, let me explain.

287
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,648 
- Who are you supposed to be?

288
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,733 
- Bambi, it's me, Holly.

289
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,026 
l mean what are you wearing?

290
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,319 
- l was at the gym
when you called,

291
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,737 
but l brought a change
of clothing.

292
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,322 
- Okay, l'll tell him to wait.

293
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,949 
There's a bathroom upstairs.

294
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,161 
- What does this guy do?

295
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,121 
- He's a retired movie producer.

296
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,289 
- Wait, how old?

297
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,624 
- Not too old.
Don't worry.

298
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,793 
He made a bunch of money
selling stocks.

299
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,544 
- Jeez, how many stocks
did he sell?

300
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,796 
- Never mind that.

301
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,756 
Go wash up,
and don't touch anything.

302
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,007 
- l won't.

303
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,425 
- He wants to mix it up,
so l told him

304
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,135 
my little sister
is a real peach.

305
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,512 
- Oh, l bet he liked that.

306
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,514 
- He loved that.
Men and peaches.

307
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,308 
So you get him started,
then l'll come in and join you.

308
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,977 
- Okay, l got it.
He wants a sister act.

309
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,729 
- Bells, whistles.
- The whole nine yards.

310
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,648 
- l told him we've joined
each other in bed before

311
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,609 
but never actually dared
to do anything incestuous.

312
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,860 
- And what did he say?

313
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,487 
- He wondered
if we'd be open to it.

314
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,780 
- So he's not a cop?

315
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,864 
- How do you mean?

316
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,324 
- Mentioning
the whole incest thing

317
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,367 
proves he's not a cop.

318
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,535 
- Of course he's not a cop.

319
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,869 
He's a regular customer of mine.

320
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,830 
- Okay, sorry.

321
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,498 
Go on.
Then what did he say?

322
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,167 
- So l said,
"Under the right circumstances,

323
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,169 
with the right guy,"
wink, wink.

324
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,421 
- Okay.

325
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,548 
Well, if...

326
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,717 
- What?
- Well, okay-no, no.

327
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,884 
- No what?

328
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,302 
- What if he wants details?

329
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,303 
- Details?

330
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,680 
- About us growing up.

331
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,723 
- Give him details.

332
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,807 
- Make them up?

333
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,017 
- But keep it simple.

334
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,101 
He's a regular customer.

335
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,853 
- Simple.
Got it.

336
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,187 
- Don't bend over backwards.

337
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,689 
- Don't bend over
backwards?

338
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,898 
- With some tale.

339
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,525 
Don't bend over backwards
with some tale

340
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,860 
l'll have to remember
every time.

341
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,403 
- Got it.
l thought you meant literally.

342
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,904 
- You're overthinking this.

343
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,406 
- l know.
Sometimes l do that.

344
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,741 
My brain just...

345
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,035 
- l know.
That's why l'm telling you.

346
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,453 
- lt only happens
when l get nervous.

347
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,871 
- What are you nervous about?

348
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,330 
- l don't know,
l'm-

349
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,082 
l'm not.
Nothing.

350
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,625 
- You're not still
beating yourself up

351
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,668 
over the pussy-eating?

352
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,170 
- No.
- Good.

353
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,172 
'Cause this is me, babe.
Don't sweat it.

354
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,757 
- l am good to go.
l swear.

355
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,842 
- You are a sexual volcano.

356
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,427 
That's why l called you.

357
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,472 
- Hmm, l appreciate that,
and l won't let you down.

358
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,765 
l'm just a little sore.

359
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,099 
- You shot today?

360
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,518 
- Yeah, just one scene
but, still, Jimmy Cojones.

361
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,770 
- Oh, you poor thing.

362
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,063 
- He's not that bad.

363
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,564 
- Yeah, if you got all day.

364
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,733 
- Oh, and he makes those faces.

365
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,735 
- And the coffee breath.
- Oh, there's that.

366
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,780 
- And then you went to the gym?

367
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,323 
- l still got four more pounds
to go.

368
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,241 
- Where?
You look great.

369
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,743 
- Thanks.

370
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,204 
Well, Lionel's 20 minutes tops.

371
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,414 
ln and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

372
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,582 
- Great.
What's his name?

373
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,708 
- Lionel.

374
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,710 
- ls he black?
- No.

375
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,878 
- lt's not a problem if he is.

376
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,630 
l just never met
a white Lionel before.

377
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,298 
- He's white-ish.

378
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,925 
But don't call him Lionel.

379
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,886 
l call him Lionel, but he wants
you to call him Patron.

380
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,096 
- Like the tequila.

381
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,806 
- lt means "boss" in Spanish.

382
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,141 
- Patron.
Okay.

383
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,684 
Anything else l should know?

384
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,936 
- He likes it up the butt.

385
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,062 
- Whose butt?

386
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,439 
- Mine.
Whose butt are we talking about?

387
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,816 
- l don't know.
l thought maybe his.

388
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,151 
- How is he gonna stick his dick
up his own butt?

389
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,487 
- Right.

390
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,822 
l just thought maybe-

391
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,949 
- You know how they say,
"lt's not rocket science"?

392
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,118 
That would be rocket science.

393
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,452 
- He pays you extra for it,
l hope.

394
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,663 
- A lot extra.
- Not enough for me.

395
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,456 
- My, my.

396
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,584 
Aren't you the elegant
dick licker all of a sudden?

397
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,920 
- Some things are off-limits
is all.

398
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,297 
- Not with George Katz
it wasn't.

399
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,217 
- That was a matter
of birth control.

400
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,677 
- You were being responsible.

401
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,011 
- lt always comes back
to George.

402
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,346 
- l was just talking.

403
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,431 
- You know, a human person
can only apologize so much.

404
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,641 
- ls that a fact?

405
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,059 
- You know, if he's so crazy
about you,

406
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,644 
how come he asked me
to give him a blow job

407
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,812 
every time you left the room?

408
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,438 
- You could have said no.

409
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,815 
- l was in an awkward position.

410
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,693 
l mean, the way he looked at me,

411
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,570 
it was just different
than other guys.

412
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,113 
- Different?

413
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,949 
- Yeah, like every time he came
in the room,

414
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,784 
l could feel him
mentally undressing me

415
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,994 
with his eyes.

416
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,329 
- Holly, we were working
in a strip club.

417
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,372 
- lt's hard to explain.

418
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,166 
- So l gather.

419
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,625 
- That was what,
two, three years ago?

420
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,877 
lf you still love him, call him.

421
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,003 
- He's in prison.

422
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,546 
- Then why are we
still discussing this?

423
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,964 
- Look, forget l brought it up.

424
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,632 
- l mean, do you want
to spend every weekend

425
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,301 
talking through
the glass phone thingy?

426
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,554 
- What the fuck was that?

427
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,889 
- lt sounded
like glass breaking.

428
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,810 
Now it sounds like men's voices.
- Shh.

429
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,855 
- l don't have it.

430
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,441 
- You don't have it?
Gee, l never heard that before.

431
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,692 
You heard that one before, Rico?

432
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,374 
When you borrow something
and refuse to pay back...

433
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,376 
- Please don't hurt me!

434
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,544 
- Hurt you?

435
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,837 
We're not gonna hurt you, Marco.

436
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,340 
We're gonna smash
your fucking head in.

437
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,550 
- Please don't hurt me!

438
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,570 
- Ow!

439
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,780 
Ow.
- Come on.

440
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,114 
We don't have time for this.

441
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,449 
- Oh, my God.

442
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,368 
l didn't even see her.
- lt's nothing, really.

443
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,119 
- ls she gonna be all right?
- She's fine.

444
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,454 
This happens to her
all the time.

445
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,747 
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

446
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,123 
She's blind as a bat.

447
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,125 
- But she needs a hospital.
- Oh, don't be silly.

448
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,752 
Maybe you can just drop us
down the block.

449
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,087 
- Down the block?

450
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,797 
- Yeah, wherever you're going.
We're easy.

451
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,590 
- l'm-l'm going to a bar.

452
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,217 
- Great idea.

453
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,845 
- Maxine, wait.
Let me explain.

454
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,142 
- d l found l wasn't to blame d

455
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:19,193 
d l discovered
that it had to be you d

456
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,912 
- Will your wife be wanting
anything else?

457
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,749 
- She's not my wife,
and you know it.

458
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,127 
- l don't know it.
How would l know that?

459
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,212 
- You play innocent
remarkably well.

460
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,505 
Are you an actress?

461
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,633 
- Does it look like
l'm an actress?

462
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,178 
- Oh, yes, it looks like
you're an actress.

463
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,805 
l thought maybe
you were doing research

464
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,640 
for a part
playing a flight attendant.

465
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,184 
Now, l watch mostly old films
on tour,

466
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,187 
and you could be
a ridiculously famous movie star

467
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,523 
and l just wouldn't-
l wouldn't have the faintest.

468
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,234 
- l'm flattered, but l'm not.

469
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,986 
- Well, look, look, look.

470
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,154 
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

471
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,323 
l want to say something.

472
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,657 
Now, let me tell you something.

473
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,204 
- l would very much like
to carry on floating with you

474
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,497 
after we land.

475
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,875 
And l would like for you
to come along to my hotel

476
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,337 
and maybe drop some ecstasy
and just be.

477
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,546 
- ls that right?

478
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,841 
- Yeah, l'm just so sick
of this army

479
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,302 
of blank-eyed zombies
all around me.

480
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,636 
Do you know?

481
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,264 
And l feel that perhaps
you are as well, am l right?

482
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,725 
Well, you know what
l'm talking about, right?

483
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,355 
l mean, they're out to steal
our air, our soul, our music.

484
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,690 
And they will stop at nothing.

485
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,778 
See, the thing is,
they have no substance.

486
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,906 
They're made of dust
and numbers.

487
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,701 
Their hearts are nothing
but cheap little calculators

488
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,495 
that just keep pumping out
receipts.

489
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,372 
Do you know what l'm saying?

490
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,085 
So what do you say?

491
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,170 
- Uh...

492
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,047 
uh, l...

493
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,673 
l...

494
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,511 
l don't know.

495
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,306 
l have to get back to work.

496
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,935 
- What?
Are you blushing?

497
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,770 
That's fucking sexy.

498
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,230 
Ah.

499
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,149 
- And how is Prince Charming
doing?

500
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,901 
- l'm pretty sure
he's on something.

501
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,027 
- Pretty sure?

502
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,445 
The band left him behind.

503
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,280 
The manager's escorting him
because they don't trust

504
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,365 
he'll get to his show
on his own.

505
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,783 
- lt says all that
in your paperback?

506
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,451 
- l looked it up online
during takeoff.

507
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,370 
- l think he's very nice.

508
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,914 
- Every rattlesnake
has its charms.

509
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,791 
- Am l detecting just a whiff
of jealousy here?

510
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,211 
Could it be because rock god
Nick Chapel

511
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,630 
is paying more attention to me
than he is to you?

512
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,299 
l'm just looking out
for my girl...

513
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,801 
and her fiance.

514
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,387 
- Oh, that is low.
Even for you.

515
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,805 
- Low?

516
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,765 
Who was sticking her ass
in the drummer boy's face

517
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,308 
pretending the movie screen
was stuck?

518
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,685 
- And who'd l learn that from?

519
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,811 
- Oh, when l do it,

520
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,146 
it's a masterpiece of subtlety.

521
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,605 
No.

522
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,524 
This is you.

523
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,823 
- That's kind of hot,
admit it.

524
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,992 
But l have a little more junk
in my trunk.

525
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,161 
- Even a little more
than you'd like these days...

526
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,745 
- Ah.

527
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,706 
- And that's why you're being
all Mother Superior.

528
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,624 
- Oh, you're such a whore.

529
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,335 
- Besides...

530
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,963 
even if something happened,
and that's a mighty big if,

531
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,590 
Benjamin would never find out.

532
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,593 
And even if he did,
he might understand.

533
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,303 
- Right.

534
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,096 
- Couples give each other
free passes

535
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,222 
for certain celebrities.

536
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,933 
- And you guys do that?
- No.

537
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,894 
But Nick Chapel would be
on the list.

538
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,146 
- So ethically and morally,
you're all set.

539
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,023 
l mean, it would almost be
irresponsible of you

540
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,357 
not to fuck him.

541
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,817 
- The guy wrote
Welcomed by a Kiss.

542
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,694 
How many drummers wrote
their band's best song?

543
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,614 
- Don Henley, Phil Collins,
Gil Moore.

544
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,032 
- Who the hell is Gil Moore?

545
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,868 
- He split songwriting duties
with Rik Emmett in Triumph.

546
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,286 
- Who the hell is Triumph?

547
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,288 
- Who the hell is Tri-

548
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:03,667 
Fight the Good Fight,
When the Lights go Down.

549
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,544 
Magic Power.

550
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,881 
d l'm young, l'm wild,
and l'm free d

551
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,675 
d l got the magic power
of the- d

552
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,552 
- Uh, pardon me, ladies.

553
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,598 
l just need to use the lavatory.

554
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,571 
- Gosh.

555
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,031 
- Nice.

556
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,914 
What do you think?

557
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,832 
- l think if you're asking me
what l think,

558
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,085 
you've already made up
your mind.

559
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,419 
- Does it make me a bad person?

560
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,463 
- Who am l to judge?

561
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,606 
- You done this before?

562
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,441 
- Mm-mm. Never.

563
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,609 
- Are you sure?

564
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,112 
- l'm sure, are you?
- No, never.

565
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,863 
- Oh, look,
you're blushing again.

566
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,782 
- Once before.

567
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,992 
- What, with a passenger?

568
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,618 
- Oh, God, no.
Pilot.

569
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,869 
- While he was flying the plane?

570
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,247 
There was a copilot too.

571
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,540 
- What, you did both?

572
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,751 
- l mean the copilot
was flying the plane

573
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,878 
while l was with the pilot.

574
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,297 
- All right, look.

575
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,048 
Full disclosure here?
- Yeah.

576
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,259 
- lt's my second time.
- Yeah?

577
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,802 
- Yeah, we're flying
commercial here.

578
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,470 
l mean, we're not counting
private, are we?

579
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,264 
- You're the one counting.

580
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,473 
- Look.

581
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,392 
l feel the need to tell you

582
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,769 
that l've recently been dating
a porn star, okay?

583
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,271 
Her name is Elektra Luxx.

584
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,939 
- Oh, you-you don't need
to tell me that.

585
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,067 
- No? You may have seen
the sex video that got leaked.

586
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,485 
- Um...

587
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,487 
- Well, it's a delicate matter
because some women,

588
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,573 
they-they get intimidated
because they're trying

589
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,907 
to measure up, you know?
- Yeah.

590
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,535 
- No, l need for you to know
that with you...

591
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,287 
it's not the sex l'm after.

592
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,913 
Not that l was into Elektra

593
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,999 
for that exclusively either,
you understand?

594
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,083 
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,918 
But with you, you see,

596
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,421 
l'm turned on by talent,

597
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,673 
by people who are the best
at what they do.

598
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,676 
And l look at you, and l say,
"Oh, she's the best."

599
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,762 
And l can tell
in the blink of an eye.

600
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,472 
But with her,
look, Elektra, she's-

601
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,224 
As much as l applaud the fact
she can pin both ankles

602
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,101 
behind her ears
while she orgasms,

603
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,896 
it's just always felt like
emotional quicksand, you know?

604
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,358 
But with you...

605
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,444 
l can feel your organic essence,
you know, your animal core.

606
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,571 
l mean, that's what your name
means, right, Cora?

607
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,158 
lt's like the core,
the center.

608
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,452 
The heart of the orchard.
- That's right.

609
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,726 
ding!

610
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,728 
- Sorry, folks, we caught
a sliver of that storm

611
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,813 
l mentioned earlier.

612
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,272 
lt should go back
to smooth sailing

613
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,191 
in just a moment or so.

614
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,776 
So if you could kindly return
to your seat

615
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,902 
and fasten your seat belt.

616
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,362 
- Oh!

617
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,078 
- Cora?

618
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,040 
Guys.

619
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,588 
- Oh, my God, Maggie.

620
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,715 
- What?

621
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,258 
- l think he's dead.

622
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,680 
- He was giving me oral,
and then he bumped his head,

623
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,140 
and it sounded
like something broke,

624
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,349 
and l can't wake him.

625
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,855 
ls he not breathing?

626
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,274 
- l can't tell.

627
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,317 
But l can tell you
where all the blood went.

628
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,403 
- Oh, Maggie,
you got to help me.

629
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,863 
l am so fucked.
- Okay.

630
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,781 
l'm gonna go see if there's
a doctor on the plane.

631
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,825 
Put his clothes back on
and pull yourself together.

632
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,243 
- How am l gonna explain this?

633
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,244 
- Listen to me carefully.

634
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,662 
He was in the lavatory.

635
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,122 
The captain made
his announcement.

636
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,498 
We knocked on the door.

637
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,375 
He didn't respond, so we were
forced to open the door.

638
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,753 
He collapsed on his own,
possibly a drug overdose.

639
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,296 
- With a raging hard-on?

640
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,756 
- Try to see
if you can bring it down.

641
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,299 
- What?
How?

642
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,092 
Maggie.

643
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,720 
Shit.

644
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,519 
Oh.

645
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:39,109 
Down, boy.

646
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,947 
Down.

647
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,998 
What a waste.

648
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,586 
- ls anybody out there?

649
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,256 
Can anybody hear us?

650
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,177 
We're trapped in the elevator!

651
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,013 
Anyone!

652
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,098 
Can anyone hear us?

653
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,350 
- Someone turned it off.

654
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,185 
Maybe the fire department's
finally here.

655
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,354 
- Obviously you haven't been
watching the news today.

656
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,772 
- l don't watch much TV.

657
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,857 
- Well, you couldn't have missed
it in the papers then.

658
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,609 
- Listen, lady.
Don't take that tone with me.

659
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,194 
- Don't call me lady.
- What's your name?

660
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,029 
- None of your business.
- What is your problem?

661
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,531 
- My problem is
that we are on day three

662
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,033 
of a massive heat wave
with forest fires everywhere

663
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,452 
and l really don't think they're
gonna be able to spare anyone

664
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,704 
to help a couple of idiots
who are trapped in an elevator.

665
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,623 
And if you had read the paper,
you would know that.

666
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,875 
- Wow, fit all that
in the paper, huh?

667
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,294 
- Well, you got to read
between the lines.

668
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,463 
Can anyone hear me?

669
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,966 
- Will you stop
just for five minutes.

670
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,342 
Please.

671
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,802 
- Well, what do you suggest?

672
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,512 
Just wait here and die
of smoke inhalation?

673
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,681 
We have been here for an hour.

674
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,850 
There is no smoke
and no fire.

675
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,727 
We are trapped in the elevator,
plain and simple.

676
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,854 
- You don't know that.

677
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,647 
The first five floors
of this building

678
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,731 
could be on fire.

679
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,899 
We wouldn't know.

680
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,693 
- We would be able to smell it.

681
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,069 
- How do you know that?

682
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,571 
What do you know about fires?

683
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,282 
- My dad was a fireman,
and he told me

684
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,200 
the first thing you do
when you are trapped

685
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,536 
in an elevator
with a hysterical person

686
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,790 
is explain to them that they are
wasting precious oxygen.

687
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,259 
- l'm not hysterical.
l'm claustrophobic.

688
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,385 
- l'm afraid of heights.

689
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,553 
- And l'm afraid of falling.

690
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,888 
- l'm pregnant.

691
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,392 
- Congratulations.

692
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,437 
- Don't.
- ls that why you're here?

693
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,521 
- l just found out.

694
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,400 
- First one?

695
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,568 
- Yes.

696
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,069 
Maybe.

697
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,571 
- l think you would know.

698
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,574 
- Well, if l have it, then, yes,
it will be my first one.

699
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,702 
How about you?

700
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,996 
- Uh...

701
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,040 
l have a niece
that l'm really close to.

702
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,917 
That was her mom
l was talking to on the phone

703
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,043 
when l came in here.

704
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,586 
My sister.

705
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,797 
l mean, obviously my sister
is my niece's mom, you know.

706
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,424 
And l love her.

707
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,302 
lt's just she's sort of like
a really stupid version of me.

708
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,721 
- Huh.
Close relationship.

709
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,808 
- Too close.

710
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,645 
ls there anybody out there?

711
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,647 
- One, two.

712
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,565 
One, two, three, four.

713
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,405 
d d

714
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:34,326 
d l used to say l love you d

715
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,455 
d lt wasn't really true d

716
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,584 
d Why l didn't love you d

717
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,338 
d And now l almost do d

718
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,384 
d l used to say l love you d

719
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,554 
d l said it as a threat d

720
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,433 
d Or maybe as a promise d

721
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,896 
d To see what l could get d

722
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:10,862 
d But my heart
doesn't ache anymore d

723
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:18,704 
d No, my heart doesn't break
anymore d

724
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:27,254 
d 'Cause it just couldn't take
any more d

725
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,338 
- Girls' night out?

726
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,840 
- Something like that.

727
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,719 
- Your friend looks about ready
to pass out.

728
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,720 
- Yeah.

729
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,804 
She's not really my friend.

730
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,055 
- What's wrong with her?

731
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,141 
- She caught her husband
with one of her patients.

732
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,142 
- She's a doctor?

733
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,143 
- Shrink.

734
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,061 
Go figure.

735
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,187 
- Go figure.

736
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,355 
- Women are like flies:

737
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,399 
they settle on sugar or shit.

738
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,067 
- You married?
- No.

739
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,485 
Lucky that way.

740
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,738 
- Me neither.

741
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,990 
ls business always this slow?

742
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,075 
- lt picks up in about an hour,
but...

743
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,410 
- What?

744
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,370 
- lt might not be
your ideal clientele.

745
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,291 
What?
You think l look like a pro?

746
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,378 
No, l think you look
like a blast.

747
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,796 
You ready for another?

748
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,922 
- What the hell.

749
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,591 
- Some wetback with a broom
just offered me

750
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,759 
50 bucks for a hand job.

751
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,760 
- What?

752
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,553 
Ah, that's Manuel.

753
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,597 
What is he-his shift doesn't
start for another hour.

754
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,432 
- Well, he sure is cussing up
a storm in the john.

755
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,600 
- He's got Tourette's.

756
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,185 
He's harmless.
Honest to God.

757
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,228 
l'm sorry about that.

758
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,396 
- Hey, shit happens.

759
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,939 
Can l get a pina colada?

760
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,566 
- Sure.

761
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,069 
- You didn't, did you?

762
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,403 
- What?

763
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,405 
- Holly.

764
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,365 
- l didn't.

765
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,204 
Okay, next round's on me.

766
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,081 
- You really are a pig.

767
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,416 
- l am vulgar, but l have
potential for class.

768
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,918 
- Really deep down.

769
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,377 
- Like you're the Virgin Mary.

770
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,379 
l just made a buck a second.
What's wrong with that?

771
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,132 
- Well, for starters,
your facts on the Virgin Mary.

772
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,468 
She wasn't actually a virgin.

773
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,387 
- You are sick,
you know that?

774
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,056 
ls nothing sacred to you?

775
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,974 
- Okay, forget it.

776
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,434 
What did he look like?

777
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,269 
- Five and change.
Pencil-ish.

778
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,230 
- The guy's face.

779
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,731 
- Oh.
l don't know.

780
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,359 
Soccer player
or serial killer type.

781
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,406 
His jeans are tight,
like Starsky and Hutch tight.

782
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,492 
So it takes me a second
to get it out.

783
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,328 
And right off the bat,
he starts barking off speeds,

784
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,579 
steering my hand.

785
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,623 
"Pronto, pronto, pronto.

786
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,666 
"Motherfucking Christ!

787
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,751 
"Suave, muchacha, si, si, si.

788
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,628 
Motherfucking maricon. "

789
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:35,924 
- How about a beer instead?

790
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,510 
- Okay.

791
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,930 
- Backseat drivers
are the fucking worst.

792
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,765 
- Yeah, they really mess up
my game.

793
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,357 
Yeah, l think l'm gonna stay,

794
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,817 
see if l can't turn
this night around.

795
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,944 
- Here?
lt's a dyke bar.

796
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,612 
- How do you know?
There's nobody in there.

797
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,823 
- Trust me.
- Well, l'll take my chances.

798
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,366 
- Look, don't stay here.

799
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,618 
You're gonna get cruised,
but you're not gonna get paid.

800
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,870 
These women get it for free.

801
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,329 
- And who made you the expert?

802
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,081 
l mean, maybe there's
some curious divorcee

803
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,875 
who wants somebody
with the touch, you know?

804
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,001 
- And you have the touch?

805
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,627 
- Excuse me?

806
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,255 
- Haven't you been whining
to me all week

807
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,382 
about your girl-on-girl scene
fiasco?

808
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,218 
- Okay, l ate some bad
Mexican food from catering

809
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,553 
that wouldn't stay down.

810
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,054 
lt doesn't mean
that l can't eat pussy.

811
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,055 
l'm not retarded.

812
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,724 
- Wait.
You threw up on her?

813
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,725 
You didn't tell me that.

814
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,976 
- l told you l got sick.

815
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,187 
- You told me you felt sick.

816
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,106 
You're uncomfortable with women,
you felt sick, you had to stop,

817
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,026 
not you were eating her pussy
and puked on camera.

818
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,194 
That's a big difference.

819
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,196 
- l turned away from the camera.

820
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:43,283 
- You know what,
you're lucky l love you so much,

821
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,243 
because you're so dumb,
it's freaky.

822
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,703 
- l'm dumb?

823
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,705 
Who's going straight back
to the lion's den?

824
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,707 
Those men probably killed
your stock salesman

825
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,833 
and are waiting for us.

826
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,418 
- What would you have me do?

827
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,836 
Have her drive home?

828
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:55,921 
- l don't know.
Call a cab.

829
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,255 
Put her on a bus.

830
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,590 
l think you want to help her.

831
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,008 
- Yeah, so?

832
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,927 
- So you're contracting yourself
all over again.

833
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,511 
- l'm what?

834
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,847 
Would you listen to yourself
once in a while?

835
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,766 
l'm "contradicting" myself.

836
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,560 
ls that the term
you're looking for?

837
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,937 
How am l doing that?

838
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,855 
- Well, you pick on me
all night,

839
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,941 
and then you go play
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold.

840
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,942 
- Whatever.

841
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,235 
You want to stay, stay.

842
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,527 
l'll call you.
- Don't.

843
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,738 
Not if it's gonna be like this.
- Okay, Holly.

844
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,449 
- And what the fuck do you mean
the Virgin Mary wasn't a virgin?

845
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,117 
l mean, were you there?

846
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,661 
Did you do her?

847
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,705 
- She's known as the Virgin Mary
because her mother, Anne,

848
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,290 
conceived her
free of original sin.

849
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,376 
lt's called
the immaculate conception.

850
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,795 
Joseph and Mary were probably
getting it on the whole time.

851
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,296 
The guy was a carpenter.

852
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,215 
- And what exactly does that
have to do with me?

853
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,299 
- You asked me.

854
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,884 
- Because you
brought it up before.

855
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,177 
So we're even Stephen.

856
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,487 
- You sure she saw you?

857
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,572 
- Positive.

858
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,241 
She was creeping
down the stairs.

859
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,952 
l wouldn't have a prayer
in a lineup.

860
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,496 
- Man, look at those legs.

861
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,456 
We're gonna be sawing all night.

862
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,917 
Come on.
Let's get this over with.

863
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,681 
Whatever you do,
don't scream.

864
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,616 
Bobby?

865
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,173 
- How much do you like
your balls?

866
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:17,812 
d d

867
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,581 
- Have you ever made
a really bad mistake?

868
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,250 
One thing you can never
forgive yourself for?

869
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,669 
- l can pick only one?

870
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,921 
- l'm serious.

871
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,173 
- Who was joking?

872
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,428 
- When l was 25,

873
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,722 
l got knocked up by this guy,

874
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,308 
this angel of death
with beautiful blond curls

875
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,102 
and a mean streak.

876
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,437 
He was young and...

877
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,314 
apocalyptic.

878
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,857 
And l loved him so much,

879
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,276 
l didn't even realize
l had a meth problem.

880
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,986 
- This is that moment, right?

881
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,571 
- What moment?

882
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,906 
- On the bus,

883
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:14,285 
when the complete stranger
tells you they got cancer.

884
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,037 
- l wouldn't know.
l drive a car.

885
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,709 
- Sorry.
Uh, go on.

886
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,794 
- Go on what?

887
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,796 
- With the story
about your boyfriend,

888
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,797 
the meth dealer.

889
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,967 
l'm not sharing anything
with you now.

890
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,301 
- Uh, please.

891
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,972 
l am a great listener.

892
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,767 
Perhaps l've had
one of those days.

893
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,355 
Come on.

894
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,692 
You were pregnant,
and your boyfriend was a dealer.

895
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,362 
- Hmm.

896
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,661 
So this one morning,
l'm puking my guts out,

897
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,706 
the first trimester.

898
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,082 
My boyfriend's trying to sleep.

899
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,542 
He comes storming out
of the bedroom

900
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,669 
and starts beating me
with a wire hanger

901
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,129 
and telling me to shut up,

902
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,922 
that he's trying to get
his beauty rest.

903
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,091 
And l just started laughing,

904
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,719 
'cause in that moment,
l realized that if he ever knew

905
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,681 
that l was pregnant
with his kid,

906
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,476 
l would never be free of him.

907
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,810 
- Hmm.

908
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,480 
- l don't think l had ever felt
that much clarity.

909
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,150 
So l walked out the door
and left forever.

910
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,819 
But in my haste,
l left the door open,

911
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,280 
and the apartment
across the hall

912
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,032 
is being watched by the feds

913
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,534 
on a tip that there's
a militia cell

914
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,369 
operating out of it.

915
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,455 
So these militia goons
dumped a bunch of their trash

916
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,207 
in my boyfriend's apartment.

917
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,876 
End result: my boyfriend
ended up doing time

918
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,544 
on a terrorist conspiracy.

919
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,006 
- So where's the big mistake?

920
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,134 
- The big mistake is that

921
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,013 
l got paranoid that l was gonna
get dragged into it.

922
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,891 
l mean, these court hearings
went on forever.

923
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,227 
So when my daughter was born,

924
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,731 
l left her in the care
of my sister

925
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,858 
and went into hiding.

926
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,402 
- They were looking for you?

927
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,404 
- No.

928
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,616 
l mean, l thought l was like
this big '60s radical,

929
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,744 
you know, going underground
and fighting for my beliefs.

930
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,412 
They didn't give a rat's ass
about me.

931
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,708 
- There's a moral, and it's
gonna be a mind-fuck, isn't it?

932
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,753 
- The moral is that

933
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,923 
by the time l got back
from Amsterdam

934
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,925 
to reclaim my daughter,

935
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,219 
she had, for all intents
and purposes,

936
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,972 
become my sister's daughter.

937
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,099 
And l was either
not strong enough

938
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:46,646 
or not weak enough
to take her back.

939
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,568 
- Does she even know?

940
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,696 
- What she knows is that her mom
and l fight a lot.

941
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,908 
They're both in therapy now.

942
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,126 
l went to therapy once.

943
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,753 
lt didn't do much for me.

944
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,796 
- No?

945
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,299 
- lt was just some creep
getting off

946
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,218 
comparing me to dog shit
stuck to the bottom of a shoe.

947
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,137 
- He said that?

948
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,515 
- He worked in metaphors,
he said,

949
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,309 
but the only thing
he seemed to care about

950
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,936 
was whether l enjoyed anal sex.

951
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,273 
What is it with guys
and anal sex anyway?

952
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,816 
Are they all fags?

953
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,319 
- lt sure doesn't sound like
you went to the right therapist.

954
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,195 
- The only reason l went to him
was to talk to him

955
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,239 
about how to deal
with guys just like him.

956
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,491 
lnstead, he spent the whole hour
talking to my rack

957
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,577 
and informed me
the reason every guy l meet

958
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,787 
wants to bang me
is 'cause of my job.

959
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,080 
- Where do you work?

960
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,582 
- l'm an actress.

961
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,250 
- Oh, yeah?

962
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,668 
Movies? Television?

963
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,961 
- Porn.

964
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,465 
- Wow.

965
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,011 
Can l ask you, like, how you...

966
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,679 
l mean, you're so pretty.

967
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,432 
You could be in, like,
normal things.

968
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,017 
l mean, not that porn
isn't normal.

969
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,019 
lt's just, you know,
l'm just curious, like,

970
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,980 
how you got started in that.

971
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:17,195 
- When l first moved out here,
l had this roommate, Riley,

972
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,947 
this beautiful hippie girl
from Boulder.

973
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,908 
l loved her to death.

974
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,326 
We were way behind on our rent,

975
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,828 
and she made me come with her
to this so-called audition

976
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,623 
as moral support,
no pun intended,

977
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,000 
and, uh, that was that.

978
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,126 
- Weren't you scared?

979
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,879 
- Holy fuck.
l was shitting bricks.

980
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:40,385 
My first video, l did a scene
with the legendary Jimmy Haynes.

981
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,554 
All penis, that man,
may he rest in peace.

982
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,556 
But the second those cameras
started rolling,

983
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,809 
l knew exactly what to do.

984
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,060 
Maybe it's genetic.

985
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,145 
My great-grandmother
was a gypsy sword-swallower,

986
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,773 
but l discovered
l have a very real talent

987
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,693 
for sucking cock on camera.

988
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,444 
Next thing you know,
five years pass

989
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,071 
without even blinking.

990
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,739 
The coke might have helped
with that,

991
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,742 
the non-blinking part.

992
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,746 
And then one day, Riley
locks herself in a motel room

993
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,040 
and blows her brains out.

994
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,669 
- Oh, my God.

995
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,129 
- l found out later
her stepfather

996
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,048 
was blackmailing her,
the same prick

997
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,218 
who had abused her
since she was ten.

998
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,137 
What else is new?

999
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,472 
My childhood wasn't
all that different.

1000
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,852 
- l'm so sorry.

1001
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,439 
- Hey,
what's that saying,

1002
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,399 
"One man's trash
is another man's treasure"?

1003
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,443 
Someone else might have turned
my childhood

1004
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,445 
into a heartbreaking novel.

1005
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,072 
Not me.

1006
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,032 
Not yet anyway.

1007
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,705 
- So are you famous?

1008
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,459 
- Yeah.

1009
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,877 
- Really famous?

1010
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,004 
- Well...okay.

1011
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,590 
Tyra Doright and Christy Climax
are probably

1012
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,301 
the most popular girls right now
in terms of web traffic.

1013
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:07,096 
But the Tyra Talking Love Doll
is seriously overpriced at $225,

1014
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,390 
and the arms don't even move
in all directions,

1015
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,603 
whereas the anatomically correct
Elektra Luxx Vagina Deluxe

1016
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,231 
retails for 89 bucks and comes
in three different colors.

1017
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:21,235 
lt is the number one selling
celebrity vagina on the market.

1018
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,489 
- Hold on.

1019
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,241 
Strangers purchase a replica
of your vagina?

1020
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,744 
- lt vibrates, and it squirts.

1021
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,247 
Oh, life is so fucking weird.

1022
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,333 
l don't even know
what to think sometimes.

1023
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,961 
- This is the Los Angeles
Fire Department.

1024
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,213 
Anybody still in here?

1025
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,340 
- We're in the elevator!

1026
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,008 
Hey!
Can you hear us?

1027
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,802 
- Yeah, hold on.
l'll get you right out.

1028
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,014 
Hey, you guys okay?

1029
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,683 
- l actually brought her
another espresso

1030
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,395 
because l did not want her
to say that she was asleep

1031
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,730 
when l talked to her.

1032
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,194 
- l can't think of any moment
in my life

1033
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,987 
that l'd like to relive.

1034
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,825 
l find myself not really being
nostalgic about anything.

1035
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,785 
But that can't be, can it?

1036
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,329 
- l just want to tell her
to just quit caterwauling around

1037
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,873 
like a goddamned puma
and get her ass in gear.

1038
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,626 
Mom, just get your act together.

1039
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,211 
- You're hot.

1040
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,587 
l'd bang you.
l think about it.

1041
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,839 
But l don't tell you.
Why?

1042
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,882 
lt's like a seesaw
in my head.

1043
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,635 
- Because in my bones,
l know the feeling.

1044
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,720 
l mean, l think l know.

1045
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:34,350 
- And l see that on the tray
are two little fortune cookies,

1046
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,894 
and l start to crack it open,
and l see the slip.

1047
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,105 
But l-at this point,
l can't read it

1048
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,692 
because my eyes
are so fricking swollen.

1049
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,028 
- l turn the lights down low.

1050
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,489 
Create a little atmosphere.

1051
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,740 
- So l bring the waiter over.

1052
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:50,825 
l said, "Can you please-

1053
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,243 
"can you please
just read this to me?

1054
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,244 
lt's my fortune."

1055
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,538 
- Yes, no, yes, no,
yes, no.

1056
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,873 
- l have nostalgia
for something.

1057
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,541 
lt just hasn't happened yet.

1058
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,334 
But it's gonna happen,
because if it doesn't,

1059
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,419 
it's all shit.

1060
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,921 
The whole point is...

1061
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,257 
like La Migra,
you know what l mean?

1062
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,176 
Like, l'm Mexico,
and she's America.

1063
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:14,765 
- A day without wearing a kilt
is like a day without sunshine.

1064
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,559 
- l mean, something's
gonna happen.

1065
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,227 
lt has to, right?

1066
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,105 
- But when l slipped
into the dress,

1067
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,524 
l felt...

1068
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,776 
fat.

1069
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,695 
- l need your encouragement
here.

1070
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,739 
l'm paralyzed by all this guilt.

1071
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,450 
- l'm young,
but l understand loneliness

1072
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,077 
and how hard it can be.

1073
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,788 
- What the fuck does that-
what is that?

1074
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,998 
- l mean, do you-
do you want me

1075
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,458 
to compliment you
on your cleavage?

1076
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,419 
- l need you to tell me
that it's okay.

1077
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,254 
- l mean, isn't "no"
really mean "yes"?

1078
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,423 
- Maxine,
it's time to wake up.

1079
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,966 
Maxine, you got to wake up now.

1080
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,303 
- Maxine, wake up.

1081
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,346 
- What?
l'm listening.

1082
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,972 
- We're here.

1083
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,393 
- Oh, okay.

1084
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:20,247 
- Where-where have you-
are you all right?

1085
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,708 
- Thank God
you're home.

1086
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,129 
- Thank you.

1087
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,255 
- Bambi.

1088
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,257 
- Have we met?
- No.

1089
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,801 
You're off the hook with me,
lamb chops.

1090
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,344 
l'm just making sure
she got home safe.

1091
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,346 
- Well, l thank you for that.

1092
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,389 
Can l, uh, call you a cab?

1093
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,515 
- What happened?

1094
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,641 
- Ah, the neighbors.

1095
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,892 
Yeah, it's been a crazy night.

1096
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,978 
You want-l can call you a cab.

1097
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,062 
- No, what happened to 'em?

1098
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,480 
- l'm not entirely sure.

1099
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,108 
Some guys he owed money to
were threatening him

1100
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,860 
or beating him up or something,
and he had a heart attack.

1101
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,572 
- Oh, that's awful.

1102
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,533 
ls he gonna make it?

1103
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,953 
- Travis.
- Yeah, coming.

1104
00:49:59,079 --> 00:49:59,996 
l don't really know.

1105
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,247 
Kind of a shady character.

1106
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,040 
You sure l can't pay
for your cab fare?

1107
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,376 
- You know, l'm gonna take
the bus, l think.

1108
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,460 
- Well, let me cover that.

1109
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,879 
That's the least l can do.

1110
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,132 
There you go.

1111
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,383 
- Actually, uh...

1112
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,884 
that's the least you can do,
all right?

1113
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,845 
- For the bus?
- For whatever's next.

1114
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,139 
lt's a long way to go.

1115
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,975 
No telling what fun and games
the gods have in store.

1116
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,728 
Good luck, Travis.

1117
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,731 
- Good luck to you too, Bambi.

1118
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,608 
- Ah, Travis.

1119
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,279 
l'm gonna take these off
and take that off.

1120
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,074 
This is impossible.

1121
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,201 
Okay.

1122
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,662 
Can you help me with these?

1123
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,748 
l'll be ready in just a minute.

1124
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,583 
l think you should, um...

1125
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,710 
We should start,
though, okay?

1126
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,172 
l'm gonna be right with you.

1127
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,802 
Okay, okay.

1128
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,222 
Now you start.

1129
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:15,154 
d d

1130
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:36,592 
d d

1131
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,357 
- l'll call you back.

1132
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,236 
You all right?

1133
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,988 
- Was that her?

1134
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,782 
- Yeah.

1135
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,285 
- What'd she say?

1136
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,790 
- She was worried about you.

1137
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,926 
Unbelievable.

1138
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,261 
Both of you.

1139
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,022 
- Maxine-
- Did you fuck me?

1140
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,107 
- What?

1141
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,359 
- A simple yes or no.
Did you fuck me?

1142
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,694 
- No.

1143
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,280 
- l don't remember
taking my clothes off.

1144
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,990 
- l helped you
with your clothes.

1145
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,159 
- Hmm.
What a gentleman.

1146
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,910 
- Well, you were very drunk
when you got home.

1147
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,203 
- Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.

1148
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,830 
l'm still drunk,
but l'm not an idiot,

1149
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,665 
so you don't have to talk to me
like l'm an idiot.

1150
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,208 
- l'm not.
- Don't.

1151
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,543 
l know what you're doing.

1152
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,879 
- l'm not doing anything, okay?

1153
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,963 
l'm just trying to explain

1154
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,548 
that when you came home,
you were wasted.

1155
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,549 
Your words.

1156
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,009 
- Now you're quoting me?

1157
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,554 
That is so condescending.

1158
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,931 
- Well, l'm sorry,
'cause l didn't mean it

1159
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,058 
to sound condescending.

1160
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,019 
- Oh, of course not.
What did you mean?

1161
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:14,148 
- What l meant was...

1162
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,358 
nothing happened tonight.

1163
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:20,154 
- Nothing happened tonight.

1164
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,867 
You have a way with words.

1165
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,163 
- ln bed.
With us.

1166
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,085 
- That's a shame.

1167
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,713 
- Why?

1168
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,009 
- 'Cause you're never gonna get
to fuck me again.

1169
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,393 
- Why don't you just go
back to sleep?

1170
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,521 
We'll just talk about it
in the morning, okay?

1171
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,275 
Okay.

1172
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,409 
But did you want to?

1173
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,786 
- What?

1174
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,537 
- Did you want to fuck me?

1175
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,789 
- No.

1176
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,749 
l mean, of course.

1177
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,798 
l want you to fall in love
with me again.

1178
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,841 
l've had other offers too.

1179
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,929 
From younger guys, richer guys,
even your friends,

1180
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,931 
but you're the one
that l want to be with.

1181
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,975 
That's what we agreed.

1182
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,768 
And now you go and do this,

1183
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,562 
and l'm gonna change everything
that l believe in.

1184
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,399 
Everything!

1185
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,485 
But l don't want to,
because you're the one

1186
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,779 
that l want to live with.

1187
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,825 
Oh, God.

1188
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,328 
- Okay, we're gonna
figure this out, all right?

1189
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,579 
Tomorrow.

1190
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,418 
Everything's clearer
in the morning, okay?

1191
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,798 
- You need something
to help you sleep?

1192
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,137 
Okay.

1193
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,227 
- Are you going to get that?

1194
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,895 
- No.

1195
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,273 
- Are you sure?

1196
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,442 
- l'm sure.

1197
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,901 
- Mm-hmm.

1198
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,783 
- God damn it, Maxine.

1199
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,204 
- Listen to me carefully,
you whiny psycho bitch.

1200
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,748 
You can't have him.

1201
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,542 
So pull your Botox head
out of your skanky little ass

1202
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,252 
and get yourself a fucking life
of your own.

1203
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,087 
You are not allowed
to borrow mine!

1204
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,339 
- Maxine.

1205
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,049 
- To think of the unbearable
amount of hours

1206
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,677 
listening to your pathetic
motherhood hang-ups

1207
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,512 
and your embarrassing jealousy
of your sister

1208
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,805 
and those excruciating dreams

1209
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,223 
of opening
that stupid restaurant,

1210
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,059 
which you're never actually
gonna do because-

1211
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,268 
What?
- Maxine, what's going on?

1212
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,353 
- Who is this?

1213
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,188 
- Open the door.
What is going on?

1214
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,023 
- Hold on!

1215
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,191 
What happened to her?

1216
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,692 
- Come on, Maxine.
Please.

1217
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,777 
- Shut up!

1218
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,487 
No, not you, Officer.

1219
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,364 
ls she gonna make it?

1220
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,415 
She ran her car into a pole.

1221
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,544 
The officer on site called
the last number she dialed

1222
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,254 
and said it's pretty serious.

1223
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,548 
You should go.

1224
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,726 
- l'm gonna stay.

1225
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,853 
- Travis,
she's in the emergency room.

1226
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,271 
She shouldn't be alone.

1227
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,148 
- Well, l'll call her sister,
and she can go.

1228
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,817 
She's her family.

1229
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,779 
- Do what you got to do.

1230
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,323 
- What l go to do is stay here.

1231
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,621 
- lt's a little late
for these gestures.

1232
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,540 
- You don't have to talk to me.

1233
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,166 
You don't have to look at me.

1234
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,961 
You don't even have to be
in the same room as me.

1235
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,587 
Just go to sleep.

1236
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,381 
l'm gonna put on a pot
of coffee,

1237
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,174 
and l'm gonna stay right here.

1238
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:17,474 
- Good night.

1239
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,495 
Oh.

1240
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,997 
l'm sorry.
- Who are you?

1241
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,457 
- l forgot.
l'm...

1242
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,125 
l'm Rita's roommate.

1243
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,543 
- Who?

1244
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,587 
- The bartender
from Ruby's Caribbean.

1245
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,630 
She said you got attacked
in the parking lot tonight

1246
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,048 
or something.

1247
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,341 
- Oh, yeah.

1248
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,801 
- She gave you a couple Valiums,

1249
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,803 
so that's probably
what you're feeling right now.

1250
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,597 
- Right.

1251
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,101 
What's that?

1252
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,979 
- Oh, it's for work.

1253
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,314 
l'm a masseuse.

1254
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,858 
- Oh, hi, Mama.

1255
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,320 
- No, a masseuse.

1256
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,988 
l do body work.

1257
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,698 
My name is Darby.

1258
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,576 
- Oh, hi.
l'm-l'm Holly.

1259
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,370 
- So, look, if you want
to go back to sleep, l can...

1260
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,497 
- No.
No, really.

1261
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,291 
l'm-l'm good.
l'm good.

1262
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,045 
So...

1263
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,838 
where are you from?

1264
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,507 
- Oh, l'm Canadian.

1265
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,759 
- Wow.
Cool.

1266
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,801 
- Yeah, you ever been?

1267
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,844 
- No.

1268
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,763 
But l love the food.

1269
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,892 
- Um, do you know the guys
that did this to you?

1270
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,727 
- No, no.

1271
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,687 
- l guess some days
are stranger than others.

1272
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,022 
- Yeah.

1273
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,399 
- Whenever something
really weird happens to me,

1274
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,152 
l think it's, like,
a life marker.

1275
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,571 
l say to myself, "Darby,

1276
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,866 
"you are alive,
and the time is now.

1277
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,077 
Today is a day
you will not forget."

1278
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,079 
- Yeah.

1279
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,164 
And it's also my birthday.

1280
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,000 
Today is your birthday?

1281
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,503 
No shit?
Oh, my gosh.

1282
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,046 
We should have a drink
to celebrate.

1283
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,798 
- No, l really-
l can't hold my liquor.

1284
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,258 
But you should.

1285
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,592 
- Well, fuck.

1286
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,886 
You know what, let me give you
a birthday massage.

1287
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,054 
- No.

1288
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,139 
No, you really-
l couldn't.

1289
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,936 
Oh.

1290
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,272 
- Your neck is like a rock,
like you smashed it.

1291
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,274 
- Oh, yeah,
l got hit by a car today.

1292
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,358 
Twice.

1293
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,110 
- Jesus, quite the birthday,
huh?

1294
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,112 
- Yeah.

1295
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,990 
- Do you spend a lot of time
sitting at work?

1296
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,658 
- Some positions, l guess.

1297
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,119 
- Hmm.

1298
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,620 
- Ahh.

1299
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,623 
- So before getting attacked
and before getting run over,

1300
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,293 
did you do anything special
for your birthday?

1301
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,086 
- Oh.

1302
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,796 
Not really.

1303
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,048 
l mean, l, um...

1304
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,302 
l went to work,
and then l went to the gym.

1305
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,263 
And then my best friend
called me to go work with her,

1306
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,639 
but that didn't really pan out.

1307
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,892 
And then we met this woman
who took us to the bar,

1308
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,063 
and she got tanked,
and, um...

1309
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:14,818 
my friend ended up
taking her home and, um...

1310
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:17,821 
- lt's okay.

1311
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,698 
Just let it out.

1312
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,326 
Your body's been through
some major, major trauma.

1313
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,329 
- lt's not that.

1314
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,788 
lt's just Bambi.

1315
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,999 
She didn't-

1316
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,127 
she didn't even remember
it was my birthday,

1317
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,755 
and that's why l thought
she was calling to begin with.

1318
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,467 
l was sure she had some surprise
planned for me or something,

1319
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,595 
and she just wanted me
to tag-team some guy.

1320
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,347 
She's so stupid,
she doesn't even realize

1321
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,140 
that l have feelings for her.

1322
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,895 
l- l felt so nervous,

1323
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,522 
'cause even though
it was a fake thing,

1324
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,192 
just a pony show
for some cheese ball,

1325
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,612 
l thought, "You know,
she's finally gonna get it."

1326
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,113 
The whole thing got interrupted,

1327
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,282 
and she spent the whole night
making fun of me.

1328
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,786 
And l'm so bad at my job,

1329
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,704 
l'm afraid
nobody's gonna hire me

1330
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,289 
'cause l get embarrassed
talking dirty

1331
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,666 
and l can't eat pussy.

1332
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,459 
lt's just a matter of time
before they realize

1333
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,169 
that l'm the lamest
porn star ever.

1334
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:17,339 
- Well, l'm sure it's not
as bad as it seems.

1335
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:21,009 
- lt's pretty awful.

1336
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,136 
- Well, have you thought
about a new career?

1337
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,389 
- Yeah.

1338
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,557 
But l'm so dumb,
l'm not good at anything.

1339
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,393 
- You're just being hard
on yourself.

1340
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,770 
- No, l'm being honest.

1341
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,648 
You know, everybody laughs
at me.

1342
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,066 
They don't even have
the courtesy

1343
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,484 
to do it behind my back.

1344
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,486 
When those men came
at me tonight,

1345
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:43,407 
l thought, "This is it.
l'm dead.

1346
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,575 
"And l haven't even done
anything with my life

1347
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,078 
"or had the chance to tell her
about Ringo and the puking

1348
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,413 
so she'd understand."

1349
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,622 
- Tell who?

1350
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,666 
Who's Ringo?

1351
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,753 
- He was my dog when l was 12.
Golden retriever.

1352
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,088 
- What happened to him?

1353
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,424 
- God, he was...

1354
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,136 
he was always
humping everything.

1355
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,180 
lt was like,
"Get off me, you pig."

1356
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,725 
Nonstop.

1357
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,143 
And he really was
the horniest dog.

1358
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,853 
l mean, something was wrong
with him.

1359
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,107 
l've never told anybody
this before.

1360
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,068 
Okay.

1361
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:25,157 
What happened was, l, um...

1362
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,785 
l had all these
magazine articles spread out.

1363
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,122 
l was doing this school project,
this collage on rock formations.

1364
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,874 
My legs were in a V.

1365
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,919 
l was only wearing a T-shirt
and panties.

1366
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:43,884 
And Ringo comes running in
to play...

1367
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:53,351 
And he starts licking my knee,
which was funny, you know?

1368
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,690 
And then...

1369
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,569 
all of a sudden, he...

1370
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:06,865 
starts moving up my thigh,
sniffing.

1371
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,163 
And l got this tingle.

1372
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:17,167 
So out of curiosity,

1373
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:22,088 
and because my mother
was asleep,

1374
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:26,927 
l moved my panties aside.
Let him investigate.

1375
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,846 
So he just stuck his nose
in there

1376
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,183 
and started licking
between my lips.

1377
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:39,105 
And he was so gentle
and tireless.

1378
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:44,694 
l mean, that dog could have
kept licking all night.

1379
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,740 
And, you know, it felt so good.

1380
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,867 
To this day, l haven't had
better head.

1381
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,286 
So l laid down,

1382
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:58,917 
and l took off my underpants,
and l let him go to town

1383
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:03,672 
when-when...

1384
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,634 
out of nowhere, l hear my mom
yelling hysterically,

1385
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,803 
beating the dog
with a wet mop.

1386
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,055 
l mean, it was like
she was possessed.

1387
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,182 
She wouldn't talk to me
for a week.

1388
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,647 
And then one day, l came home,
and Ringo was gone.

1389
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,735 
And she said he ran away,
but l knew she was lying.

1390
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,238 
And that summer,

1391
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,533 
l found his collar and bones
buried in the backyard.

1392
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,077 
- Holly, that's horrible.

1393
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,914 
l can't believe-

1394
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,083 
l can't believe l told you that.

1395
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,459 
- lt's okay.

1396
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,215 
- So now...

1397
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:51,428 
every time
l go down on a girl,

1398
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:55,765 
l think of Ringo, and everything
just comes up in me.

1399
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,018 
l can't-l can't control it.

1400
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,269 
- Of course.

1401
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,354 
But now you've acknowledged it.

1402
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,648 
lt's time to just move on.

1403
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,984 
The body doesn't want
to hold on to these things.

1404
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,194 
lt just wants to let it go.

1405
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,240 
- You're so understanding.

1406
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,533 
You don't think l'm disgusting?

1407
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,577 
- Of course not.

1408
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,370 
- l'm not some immortal whore?

1409
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,456 
- You mean immoral?

1410
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,124 
- Yeah, that's what l mean.

1411
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,877 
- Sweetie...

1412
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,629 
l think when it comes
to pleasure,

1413
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,049 
if it feels good
and you're not hurting anyone,

1414
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,800 
then forget about morals.

1415
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,260 
What your mother did-

1416
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:35,472 
that was immoral.

1417
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,265 
- She had my uncle shoot Ringo
in the head.

1418
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,726 
- Well, that's just pure evil.

1419
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,898 
- l...

1420
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,066 
l think l'm cured.

1421
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,319 
No, l think l just-
l needed to tell somebody.

1422
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,321 
Thank you.

1423
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,823 
- Oh, sweetie,
don't mention it.

1424
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,326 
- No, l need
to pay you back somehow.

1425
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,827 
- Do not be silly.

1426
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,162 
- No, l would feel
so much better

1427
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,830 
if you'd just lie down
and let me give you head.

1428
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,290 
What?

1429
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,583 
l don't even know you.

1430
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,835 
- lt would mean so much to me.

1431
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,671 
- You should be doing this
with Bambi.

1432
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,381 
- Look, l could use
the practice.

1433
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,466 
Come on, my treat.

1434
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:14,678 
Please.

1435
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,806 
- l have to pee first.

1436
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,359 
Blessed Mary, mother of mercy,

1437
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,653 
no matter what Bambi says
about you not being a virgin,

1438
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,196 
l still believe in you

1439
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,199 
and implore
your divine guidance.

1440
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,869 
Please, please, please

1441
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,497 
help me not to barf
all over that nice Canadian girl

1442
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,000 
as l pay her back
for her kindness.

1443
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,793 
Amen.

1444
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:09,983 
d d

1445
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,029 
- l always wanted
to learn Chinese.

1446
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:18,199 
l don't know why, but ever since
l was a little girl.

1447
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:21,911 
Hello?

1448
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,079 
Darby?

1449
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:27,584 
- Hey.

1450
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,793 
ls Holly still here?

1451
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,086 
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

1452
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,254 
- This is her friend Bambi.

1453
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,506 
- Oh, hey, Bambi.
Come on in.

1454
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,425 
- You're not wearing any pants.

1455
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,887 
- lt was, uh, really stuffy
in here.

1456
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,307 
Holly's in the bathroom.

1457
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,441 
- l think the Valium
didn't sit well.

1458
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,486 
- Or maybe some Mexican food.

1459
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,906 
- Poor thing's been through
a lot today.

1460
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,699 
- Do you want a drink?

1461
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,493 
- Oh, l could use a beer.
- l'm fine.

1462
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,744 
- Okay.

1463
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,538 
- You and Darby...

1464
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,165 
- On and off.

1465
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,416 
She's young.

1466
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:09,834 
- Really?

1467
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,127 
l couldn't tell.

1468
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,545 
- How about you and, uh...

1469
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,130 
- Oh, no.

1470
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,091 
Holly's totally straight.

1471
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,468 
We're super tight, though.

1472
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,221 
Starsky and Hutch tight.

1473
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,640 
- Okay.

1474
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,225 
Here you go.

1475
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,060 
Cheers.

1476
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,732 
- What are you doing here?

1477
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,609 
- l came back to the bar.

1478
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,152 
Rita told me what happened.

1479
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,403 
- You came back for me?

1480
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,448 
- Of course l came back.

1481
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,283 
lt's past midnight.

1482
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,786 
lt's officially your birthday.

1483
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,997 
- Technically,
it was my birthday yesterday,

1484
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,916 
but it's the thought
that counts.

1485
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,918 
- Your birthday's
on the 16th, Holly.

1486
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,461 
- Right.
Yesterday.

1487
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,089 
- No, today is the 16th.

1488
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,467 
- Today is my birthday?

1489
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,140 
- Happy birthday, you goofball.

1490
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,477 
l got the whole day planned.

1491
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:10,603 
Let's go get some sleep.

1492
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,729 
- Mm.

1493
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,357 
- Oh, don't forget your bag.

1494
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,900 
- Thank you.

1495
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,993 
- Doris.

1496
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,123 
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

1497
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,125 
- l had no right
to call you like this.

1498
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,293 
l do have friends.

1499
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,377 
l am not a weirdo.

1500
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,712 
- Stop apologizing.
lt's fine.

1501
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,547 
- l just couldn't deal
with any of them tonight.

1502
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,798 
- l don't sleep much anyway.

1503
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,383 
- lt's so late.
You must think l'm crazy.

1504
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,886 
- What happened?

1505
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,055 
- She was driving, not drunk,

1506
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,892 
and somehow lost control
of the vehicle

1507
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,936 
and smashed
into a telephone pole.

1508
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,814 
The car is totaled.

1509
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,774 
She's got a bunch
of broken bones,

1510
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,234 
and they won't let me see her.

1511
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,070 
- Okay, let's not panic
till the doctor comes out.

1512
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,488 
Coffee or tea?

1513
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,740 
- lt doesn't matter.

1514
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,950 
Thank you.
You're an angel.

1515
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,619 
- Who's this?

1516
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,253 
She's so big.

1517
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,421 
- You don't have to whisper.

1518
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,048 
She sleeps through earthquakes.

1519
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,134 
l got a call
from Addy's shrink's husband,

1520
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,762 
the shrink
l was telling you about.

1521
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,598 
Somehow they contacted
them first,

1522
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,476 
and then l had to pick up
Charlotte at a sleepover,

1523
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,061 
and by the time l got here,

1524
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,939 
they were already rushing her
into the operating room.

1525
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,565 
She was probably on the phone.

1526
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,568 
She gets so distracted.

1527
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,237 
And the last conversation
l had with her,

1528
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,738 
l was such a bitch.

1529
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,824 
Let's talk about something else.

1530
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,368 
How are you feeling?

1531
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,870 
- l'm good.

1532
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:53,248 
- You're eating right?
Taking care of yourself?

1533
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:56,626 
- Since l last saw you,
l took a shower,

1534
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,754 
l had a soup and a salad,
and peed twice.

1535
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,714 
- And the father?

1536
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,466 
- What about him?

1537
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,135 
- Does he know?
- No.

1538
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,845 
- Are you gonna tell him?

1539
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,890 
- l thought l was, but,
uh, he won't call me back.

1540
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,850 
- Typical.

1541
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,436 
- lt's too bad,

1542
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,647 
'cause under
different circumstances,

1543
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,983 
l could almost see us together.

1544
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,401 
- Never say never.

1545
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,152 
- No, l mean really different
circumstances,

1546
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,905 
like an alternate universe.

1547
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,573 
He's a sweet guy.

1548
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,741 
- Handsome?

1549
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,076 
- Handsome.

1550
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,077 
- Married?

1551
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,078 
- Single.

1552
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,496 
- Rich?
- Very.

1553
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,747 
- Call him back.

1554
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:35,999 
- lt would never work.

1555
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,834 
Not with my past.

1556
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,169 
- l think you're
shortchanging yourself.

1557
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,839 
What you've done before
doesn't count.

1558
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,174 
lt's what you're going to do
from now on.

1559
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,178 
- Sounds nice.

1560
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,514 
But that's not the real world.

1561
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,809 
Anyway, l'm not even sure
l'm gonna have the baby, so...

1562
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,519 
- Are you with Miss Hunter?

1563
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,187 
- l'm her sister.

1564
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,522 
- The doctor says
you can come in,

1565
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,816 
but just one of you.

1566
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,818 
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1567
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,376 
- Yeah?

1568
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,628 
- Where's Doris?

1569
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,881 
- Oh, uh, she went to talk
to the doctor.

1570
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,674 
She'll be back soon.

1571
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,885 
- Who are you?

1572
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,720 
- l'm Elektra.

1573
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,181 
- l'm Charlotte.

1574
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,640 
- l know.

1575
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,601 
lt's good to meet you.

1576
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:41,606 
You thirsty or anything?

1577
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,232 
- No.

1578
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,822 
Cigarette?

1579
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,074 
- l can't, thanks.

1580
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,825 
- You mind if l do?

1581
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,536 
- l don't think you're allowed
in here.

1582
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,663 
- We'll see.

1583
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,807 
Okay, l'll have one.

1584
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,485 
Thanks.

1585
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:45,211 
- Doris says some stores

1586
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:48,256 
carry a plastic replica
of your vagina.

1587
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,591 
- She said that?

1588
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:53,469 
- l didn't believe her.

1589
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,847 
- lt's true.

1590
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,099 
- Really?

1591
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,892 
- Yeah.

1592
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:03,646 
- That's weird.

1593
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,773 
What do people do with it?

1594
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,152 
- Well...

1595
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:13,823 
l guess some people have
strange tastes in decorating.

1596
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,367 
You know, it's-
it's like a novelty item.

1597
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,328 
- What's a novelty?

1598
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,414 
- Like a funny thing
that doesn't really-

1599
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:25,668 
l mean, it has a use,
but it's also like a...

1600
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,545 
boy.

1601
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,965 
l'll have to think about that.

1602
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,011 
- Maybe l could bring one
into school.

1603
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,179 
- l don't think that would be-

1604
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,556 
l'm not sure
how that would go over.

1605
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:41,559 
- We could use it for sex ed
instead of those lame pictures.

1606
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,519 
- Why don't we read a magazine?

1607
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,898 
Here.

1608
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:52,069 
- Here's a good one.

1609
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,116 
"Man jailed
over his wife's breasts.

1610
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,410 
"London, July 3rd.

1611
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:02,830 
"A London man has been sentenced
to 20 months in jail

1612
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:05,208 
"for reportedly kidnapping
his wife

1613
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,877 
"to stop her from having surgery
to enlarge her breasts.

1614
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,047 
"Deckland Summer, 31,
told his wife, Emma,

1615
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,509 
"'Don't do it,' while dragging
her out of the hospital,

1616
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,053 
"where she was waiting
to have the operation,

1617
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,555 
"The Sun reported Wednesday.

1618
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,724 
"He said he had a knife
and would kill her

1619
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,893 
"if she did not come with him.

1620
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,103 
"The woman managed to escape
from Summer

1621
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,232 
"and ran into an office
before collapsing.

1622
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:33,277 
"Hospital worker Luanna Ali
told police he said to her,

1623
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:37,281 
"'l like you as you are.
l will kill you now.'

1624
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:41,244 
"Since then, Emma, 25,
has left her husband

1625
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,204 
"and also decided to forgo

1626
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,123 
the breast enhancement
operation."

1627
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,460 
So kind of a happy ending.

1628
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:52,838 
- He loved her the way she was.

1629
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,050 
lt's not easy
to find a guy like that.

1630
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,052 
- But he was crazy.

1631
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:00,596 
- Which is not hard to find.

1632
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:01,973 
- Do you have fake boobs?

1633
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,434 
- No.

1634
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,435 
You?

1635
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,729 
- l'm only 13.

1636
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,606 
- Mm, people start early
these days.

1637
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,984 
- l thought all porn stars
had fake boobs.

1638
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,861 
- Did Doris say that too?

1639
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,363 
- She said you were an actress

1640
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:19,448 
in movies
l wouldn't want to see.

1641
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,244 
You guys are really open
with each other.

1642
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,538 
- Yep.

1643
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,959 
Why do they call them
adult movies

1644
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,919 
if they're so juvenile?

1645
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,132 
- lt's a euphemism.

1646
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,926 
- What's a euphemism?

1647
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:43,097 
- Uh, a polite way
of saying something

1648
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,099 
that drags all the fun
out of saying it.

1649
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:48,269 
- Like saying a plastic vagina's
a novelty item?

1650
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,440 
You're a smart kid.

1651
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,944 
What else did your-
did Doris say?

1652
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,905 
- That in your heart,
you already quit your job,

1653
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,324 
but you don't know it yet,

1654
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,243 
and that you're yearning
to become a person of substance.

1655
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,788 
- Hmm.

1656
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:16,714 
d d

1657
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,716 
- The rock music world
is in shock

1658
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,468 
with the news that Nick Chapel,

1659
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,887 
the drummer for the popular
rock band Midnight Love Parade,

1660
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,014 
has been found dead
in the lavatory

1661
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,849 
of a commercial airliner.

1662
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,018 
lnvestigators found
drug paraphernalia on Chapel

1663
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,146 
and are handling this as
a possible accidental overdose.

1664
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,065 
The female flight attendant
was in hysterics

1665
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,983 
as the plane touched down
in New York City,

1666
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,027 
where Chapel was scheduled
to play tonight.

1667
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,701 
- Elektra.

1668
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,037 
Elektra, can you hear me?

1669
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,164 
Wake up.

1670
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,214 
- Hey.

1671
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,424 
- Hey there.

1672
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,428 
- Did l faint?

1673
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,182 
- At least you were
in the perfect place.

1674
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:09,600 
- Where's Charlotte?

1675
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,727 
- She went to get a snack.

1676
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,105 
- l like her.

1677
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,898 
- She's a little weird.

1678
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,566 
- l've never liked
any kid before,

1679
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,360 
even as a kid.

1680
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,112 
How's your sister?

1681
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,031 
- Well...

1682
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:28,160 
they are reconstructing her face
as we speak.

1683
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,414 
Those are their exact words.

1684
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,792 
They say that the plastic
surgeon is the best of the best

1685
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,711 
and she's gonna be just fine.

1686
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,839 
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

1687
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,843 
- You believe in God?

1688
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,262 
- Right now, yes.

1689
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,431 
- l'd like to believe.

1690
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,266 
But l don't know.

1691
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,393 
l look around the world,

1692
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:58,107 
and l'm in a constant state
of disbelief.

1693
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,401 
- Charlotte told me about Nick.

1694
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:05,489 
ls he the father?

1695
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,410 
Did you love him?

1696
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:13,789 
- lt's starting to dawn on me
that maybe l did.

1697
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,332 
But l never told him.

1698
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,461 
You know, the last guy
l really liked,

1699
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:19,962 
we dated for a couple months.

1700
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,297 
l didn't know
if he knew about me,

1701
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,715 
and l didn't want to ask.

1702
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,301 
But anyway...

1703
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,803 
the day after l finally went
to bed with him,

1704
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,805 
he asked me for my autograph.

1705
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:30,973 
- Hmph.

1706
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,808 
- He was almost sweet about it.

1707
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,437 
"l can't believe l fucked
Elektra Luxx," he told me.

1708
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,439 
He wanted to share it with me,
with his friends,

1709
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,274 
with the world.

1710
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,859 
With Nick, l just didn't
want him to think

1711
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:44,945 
l was some groupie stalker
after his money.

1712
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:49,492 
l just wanted so badly
not to hide anything anymore,

1713
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,619 
you know, to tell the truth.

1714
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,498 
- So tell me.

1715
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,832 
- What?

1716
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,250 
- Pretend l'm Nick.

1717
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:01,587 
Tell me the truth.

1718
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,047 
l mean, you planned your speech.

1719
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,799 
You've rehearsed it
in front of the mirror,

1720
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:05,841 
or l know l would have.

1721
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,764 
- Let me hear it.

1722
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,058 
- Okay.

1723
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,353 
Nick,

1724
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,815 
l've done 62 X-rated movies,

1725
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,151 
35 box covers,

1726
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:27,530 
a thousand club appearances.

1727
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:31,992 
l have 20 fan clubs,
my own website.

1728
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,204 
A conservative estimate
would place

1729
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:39,041 
the amount of people l've fucked
in the mid-hundreds.

1730
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,546 
l've dated movie stars,
politicians,

1731
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,090 
and a pair of twin mafioso
restaurant chefs

1732
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:50,469 
who nearly got me arrested
by drug enforcement agents.

1733
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:54,557 
l've had my amphetamine phase,
my coke phase,

1734
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,644 
my three-cigarette-pack-a-day
phase.

1735
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,399 
l haven't talked to a single
member of my family-

1736
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,401 
drunks and religious
psychopaths,

1737
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:10,656 
each and every one of them-
in ten years.

1738
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,701 
l've had three abortions,

1739
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,829 
been kicked out
of my last four apartments...

1740
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:25,546 
And l have never, ever
had anyone

1741
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,966 
kiss me like you do.

1742
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,054 
- That's beautiful.

1743
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:42,271 
But it's too late.

1744
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:48,235 
l mean, if we don't tell people
how we feel,

1745
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,904 
what are we doing here?

1746
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,242 
You need to tell Charlotte.

1747
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,787 
- l know.

1748
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,122 
Once Addy's better and-

1749
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:01,916 
- No, she needs to know now.

1750
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,293 
- Now is not a good time.

1751
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:05,711 
- But there is no good time.

1752
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,838 
There is no right time.

1753
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,465 
There is only now.

1754
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:15,137 
Your entire life can change
in five minutes.

1755
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,264 
Less.

1756
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,061 
- Charlotte.

1757
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:27,608 
- l can't decide
which looks less appealing.

1758
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,280 
- l got to talk to you.

1759
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,787 
- Did she decide
to keep the baby?

1760
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,747 
- l don't know.

1761
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,874 
lt's not about that.

1762
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,420 
l think we should sit down.

1763
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,980 
So...

1764
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,774 
a long time ago,

1765
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,571 
when l was a lot younger,
before you were born,

1766
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,448 
l did something,

1767
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:20,577 
some things,
that l'm not entirely...

1768
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:24,790 
Let me rephrase that.

1769
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,291 
- Drugs?

1770
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,584 
- No, not drugs.

1771
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,378 
lt's not that kind of a story.

1772
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:34,341 
l mean, l have done drugs,
but that's not what l...

1773
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:54,862 
You know l love you
above and beyond words.

1774
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:01,160 
l would never abandon you.

1775
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,834 
- l know, Mom.

1776
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,087 
- What?

1777
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,173 
- l said, "l know."

1778
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,134 
- What did you say after that?

1779
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:21,430 
- l found my birth certificate
a couple weeks ago.

1780
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,392 
What?

1781
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:28,228 
Why didn't you say so?

1782
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:29,605 
- l don't-
l don't know.

1783
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,023 
l guess...

1784
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:36,570 
l guess l felt bad
for Mo-l mean Addy.

1785
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,948 
- She's still your mom too.

1786
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,409 
- Yeah?

1787
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:43,744 
- Yeah.

1788
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,205 
And as soon as she's better,

1789
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:50,667 
we're gonna decide
how to work this.

1790
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,878 
But l wanted
to talk to you first,

1791
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:58,092 
because, first and foremost,
l wanted so see

1792
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:04,306 
if you'll take me back
as your mom.

1793
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:07,226 
l'm reapplying for the job.

1794
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,534 
- l'm a lot of work.

1795
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,328 
- l know.

1796
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,959 
- Excuse me, Miss Hunter.

1797
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,461 
Your sister's out of the OR.

1798
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:35,921 
You can both go see her now.

1799
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,966 
- Thank you.

1800
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,515 
- After Addy gets better,
can we all go on a road trip?

1801
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,975 
- Great idea.

1802
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,393 
- Can Elektra come too?

1803
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,936 
- We can ask her.

1804
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:52,521 
- l think she's gonna keep
the baby.

1805
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,815 
- You do?
How come?

1806
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,525 
- Because l tested her earlier.

1807
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,860 
l asked her
if she wanted to smoke,

1808
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,027 
and she said she couldn't.

1809
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,737 
- Very sneaky.

1810
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,157 
- Besides, if she has the baby,
then she can quit her job,

1811
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,533 
because she'll be a millionaire.

1812
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,535 
- Huh.

1813
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,203 
When did you get to be
so clever?

1814
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,413 
- Genetic, l guess.

1815
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,123 
Speaking of which,
when are going to tell me

1816
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,916 
about my dad?

1817
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,418 
- Hmm.
What do you want to know?

1818
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,295 
His name is George.

1819
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,005 
He's back in prison.

1820
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,173 
- His name is George?

1821
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,257 
What's his last name?

1822
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,383 
- Katz.

1823
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:22,843 
- Charlotte Katz-Hunter.

1824
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,387 
That is the worst name
l have ever heard.

1825
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,514 
- Nobody's forcing you
to take his last name.

1826
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,099 
- Can l change my middle name?

1827
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:30,601 
- You don't have a middle name.

1828
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,102 
- l know, but l want
to change my name

1829
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:33,687 
to Charlotte D. Hunter.

1830
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:35,355 
- What does the D stand for?

1831
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:36,982 
- Danger.

1832
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,775 
- Danger is your middle name?

1833
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,736 
- Danger is my middle name.

1834
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,863 
- lt's good.
l like that.

1835
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:54,166

with two hotties
who need no introductions.

1866
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,418 
Holly, would you like
to do the honors?

1867
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:02,544 
- Excuse me?

1868
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,296 
- You want to introduce
yourself?

1869
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,422 
- Oh, we've totally met.

1870
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,548 
We're in the movie together.

1871
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,050 
- He means to the camera,
sweetie.

1872
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,010 
- For all our viewers out there.

1873
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,345 
- Okay, l'm lost.

1874
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,888 
Your name's Bert, right?

Uber hot up-and-comer
Holly Rocket

1878
01:29:22,565 --> 01:29:26,109 
sitting alongside
adult film industry legend

1879
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,904 
and, if l may,
the foxiest fuck bunny

1880
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,823 
ever captured on video,
Elektra Luxx.

1881
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:33,867 
That's very sweet.

1882
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:35,202 
Thank you.

1883
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,661 
- So...

1884
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,038 
Holly.

1885
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,540 
What was it like when you heard
you'd be doing scenes

1886
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,875 
with Elektra?

1887
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,169 
- Wow.

1888
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:47,506 
l mean, l was-
l was really pinching myself.

1889
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,257 
l mean, Elektra's the reason

1890
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,426 
l got in the business
to begin with, you know.

1891
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,429 
God, l am blessed.
lt's like one big wet dream.

1892
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:55,680 
- Oh.
- lt's true.

1893
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,225 
- l'm like,
"Wow, she's licking my nipple,"

1894
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,644 
or, "That's Elektra Luxx's toe
in my butt."

1895
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,229 
l mean, it's-
it's really wild.

1896
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,605 
- That's so nice of you.

1897
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:04,940 
- But it's true.

1898
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,900 
And l've been learning so much
just watching you.

1899
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:08,276 
l mean, the way
you fill the camera.

1900
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:09,277 
- She's great.
- No, no.

1901
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,445 
l'm the biggest klutz, okay?

1902
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:12,072 
l'm always elbowing
the boom guy.

1903
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,908 
But she has
this supernatural sense

1904
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:17,828 
of everything around her,
you know?

1905
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,621 
Oh, and then
the hipster coin trick

1906
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,289 
and-and eye contact.

1907
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,958 
- Eye con-
that's your trademark.

1908
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,127 
You-you make eye contact
with the camera in a way

1909
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,796 
so the viewer at home,
he feels like, "Wow,"

1910
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,257 
like it's him
you're getting it on with.

1911
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:31,383 
- Or her.

1912
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,969 
- Or her.
Certainly.

1913
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,971 
How did you come up with that?

1914
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,266 
- Well, l've always been
very comfortable

1915
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,476 
with my fellow performers.

1916
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:43,395 
But at first, the camera made me
self-conscious.

1917
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,313 
That's hard to believe.

1918
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,274 
- Well, until l realized
the camera's

1919
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,817 
just another character
in the scene,

1920
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:49,985 
the main character, really.

1921
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,820 
- l wish l was the camera.

1922
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,905 
- So when l look at the camera,

1923
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,950 
it's like l'm letting the viewer
in on my little secret.

1924
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,160 
lt's a playful relationship.

1925
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,245 
- "Playful" being
the operative word,

1926
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,164 
and that's it.
- Bert.

1927
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,416 
Hey, you want to just
take that question?

1928
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:05,750 
Let me ask you.

1929
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:07,836 
You're famous for making
eye contact with the camera

1930
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,172 
in a way that makes the viewer
at home feel like, "Wow,"

1931
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,466 
like it's him
you're getting it on with.

1932
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:16,136 
How'd you come up with that?

1933
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:19,347 
- Wait, is he in the biz, too?

1934
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,016 
- l'm sorry.
You're right.

1935
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,851 
- lt's okay.

1936
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,060 
- l was totally unprofessional.

1937
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,437 
- No, let's move on.

1938
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:26,771 
Forget it.

1939
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,607 
- lt's just l was really excited
to meet you.

1940
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,108 
l mean, you don't know me
from Adam,

1941
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,193 
but l grew up watching you.

1942
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,694 
l mean, l know every inch
of your body

1943
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:33,987 
like the back of my hand.

1944
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,031 
- lt's okay.
Next question.

1945
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,866 
- Adam who?

1946
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,993 
- l'll tell you later.

1947
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,870 
- We have some questions
from our website.

1948
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,623 
We conduct fan polls
to determine

1949
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,292 
the greatest porn stars in
a bunch of different categories

1950
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:50,212 
from the typical
"best ass, mouth, legs,"

1951
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:51,713 
to more specialized stuff,

1952
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,257 
"best undresser,"
"best facial reaction,"

1953
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:56,134 
"sexiest moan during orgasm."

1954
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,135 
Um, let's see.

1955
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:58,345 
Elektra.

1956
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:01,181 
Right now, overall,
you are at 94%.

1957
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,974 
- Wow.
That's-that's historic.

1958
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,352 
And, Holly,
you're coming up strong,

1959
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,563 
90%, which is unheard of
for a newcomer.

1960
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:10,941 
You have "best legs" right now
by a landslide.

1961
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,734 
- She does.

1962
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,238 
- So here are some questions
submitted by our fans.

1963
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,822 
- Wait.

1964
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,115 
Do we-do we have to do
this part?

1965
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,283 
- Don't worry.
l'll help you.

1966
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:21,576 
- Holly,

1967
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,246 
"A man gives you a suitcase
with a million dollars.

1968
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,831 
"The catch is, if you accept it,
a Chinese man will drop

1969
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,333 
"in the middle of the street
and die.

1970
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,377 
What do you do?"

1971
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,382 
- l would pay
for the man's funeral

1972
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:38,718 
and then donate money
to improve street conditions

1973
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,845 
in China so that more people
won't die.

1974
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:43,932 
- "Elektra,

1975
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:47,185 
"what was the character name
of the professional wrestler

1976
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,938 
that Rocky fights
in Rocky lll?"

1977
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,439 
- What?
- Ooh, ooh.

1978
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,608 
- You know this?
- Yeah, Mr. T.

1979
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,277 
- That is incorrect.

1980
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,571 
The correct answer
is Thunderlips.

1981
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,364 
- Huh, l was in a movie
called ThunderIips.

1982
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,782 
- Back to Holly.

1983
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:02,867 
"Who was the only Beatle
whose first wife

1984
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,120 
was not pregnant
when they married?"

1985
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:06,496 
- Who came up
with these questions?

1986
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:07,539 
- The Japanese lady?

1987
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,249 
- Sorry.
The correct answer is George.

1988
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,126 
- Uh, don't feel bad.
This is crazy.

1989
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,712 
- Number three,
for you, Elektra.

1990
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,964 
"What is the name
of a whale's penis?"

1991
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,716 
- What the fuck?

1992
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:18,925 
- Whale cock!

1993
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:20,427 
- lt's not your turn, Holly.

1994
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:23,305 
- lt can't possibly be
whale cock, can it?

1995
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,639 
- l'm afraid that is wrong.

1996
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:27,225 
The name for a whale's penis
is dork.

1997
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,144 
- Dork.
- Huh.

1998
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,479 
- Yep, the blue whale
has the biggest dork.

1999
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,480 
Ten feet long.

2000
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,899 
- Jesus.
- How state-of-the-art.

2001
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,402 
- Final question,
extra credit for both of you.

2002
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,780 
"Two people stand back-to-back
then walk 30 feet,

2003
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:43,158 
"turn left,
and walk another 40 feet.

2004
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,535 
How far apart are they?"

2005
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,412 
- What kind of porn site
is this?

2006
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:51,666 
There-there is no way
you know this.

2007
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:54,169 
lt's some kind
of triangulation formula.

2008
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,378 
- lt's simple trig, l think.

2009
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:56,796 
- Simple trig?
Who are you?

2010
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:58,173 
- My mom was a math teacher.

2011
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,382 
lt's one thing l'm good at.

2012
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:00,675 
Pythagorean theorem:

2013
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,636 
A squared plus B squared
equals C squared.

2014
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:06,014 
So the two people
are making two, um...

2015
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,767 
What's the word?
Um...

2016
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:11,353 
- Um, interconnected?
- No, conjoined.

2017
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:14,314 
The two people are making
two conjoined triangles.

2018
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,149 
You can solve for C
on one triangle

2019
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,317 
and then double it.

2020
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:19,527 
So if A equals 30
and B equals 40,

2021
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,280 
then A squared equals 900
and B squared equals 1,600,

2022
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:24,532 
which would mean C squared
equals 2,500.

2023
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,326 
The square root of that is 50.

2024
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:28,536 
Multiply that times 2,
which would be...

2025
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,121 
- 100.
- 100.

2026
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:31,956 
The people are 100 feet away
from each other,

2027
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,875 
which would mean
that one person's in the kitchen

2028
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,669 
and the other person's
watching TV.

2029
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:38,672 
- That is 1,000% correct.

2030
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,840 
- What just happened?

2031
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,634 
- Will the jerk-off
blocking the loading dock

2032
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,637 
with a '79 Toyota Corolla
move it immediately, please?

2033
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:47,305 
- Fuck.

2034
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:48,473 
- Oh, is that you?

2035
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:51,059 
- What-did he say?
Did he say Corolla?

2036
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:52,811 
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, yeah.

2037
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,729 
- Do you think-
l don't really-

2038
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:55,814 
- They do tow.
- Yeah.

2039
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:56,815 
- You should check it out.

2040
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:57,941 
- Shit.
l'm so sorry.

2041
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:00,068 
l will-l'll be right back.

2042
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,195 
- Wow.

2043
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:03,488 
You could get a PhD, you know?

2044
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:04,614 
- l know.

2045
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,075 
That's why l get tested
twice a year.

2046
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:10,328 
Nobody thinks
it can happen to them,

2047
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:12,831 
but anyone can get a PhD.

2048
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,041 
Make sure you get tested.

2049
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:16,668 
Thank you.
