1
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,918
<i>You want to know
what this is all about?</i>

2
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:16,422
You could say
it's about drugs or guns

3
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,549
or disaffected youth,

4
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,677
or whatever you like.

5
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,597
But this whole thing
is about parenting.

6
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,892
It's about taking care
of your children.

7
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,395
You take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

8
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,523
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
What does that mean?

9
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:38,611
That's all I have to say about
that subject. Next question.

10
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,031
Your son
was a drug dealer?

11
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:46,368
A drug dealer? No. Did he
sell a little weed? Yeah.

12
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,373
A little weed? He was a major
supplier to the San Gabriel Valley.

13
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,501
I don't know
anything about that.

14
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,129
What about the D.A.'s assertion that
your son got his marijuana from you?

15
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:59,507
And that you have ties
to organized crime?

16
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,342
What is this
amateur night bullshit?

17
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:04,887
This isn't an interrogation,
all right?

18
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,806
I'm a taxpayer
and I'm a citizen.

19
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,142
And you are a jerk-off.

20
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,685
Did I tell you that?

21
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,734
Come on, Johnny, I don't
let fiend jump in the alley.

22
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,194
If you don't give me
fucking 12 reps,

23
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:22,571
I'm fucking your mom
and your girl.

24
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:23,614
Tell him, Tiko!

25
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,366
What'd you say?
I couldn't hear you.

26
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,910
You say you want
to suck my cock, right?

27
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,161
First you got to grow one.

28
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,455
Shit, my dick's
so big it's got a knee.

29
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,834
Five foot three,
hung like a flea.

30
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,127
Fuck, it's hot
out there.

31
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,882
What are you doing, Elvis?
Is it dark outside?

32
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:45,302
- What?
- I'm paying you for a full day, right?

33
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,598
I've been here
since 10:00 this morning.

34
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,561
Fuck that shit.
I asked you a question.

35
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,896
Do you see
the fucking moon, Elvis?

36
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,941
- It's definitely daylight.
- I'll show you my moon.

37
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,280
Johnny, I did everything
that you said.

38
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:08,325
The house is clean. I went to the store.
There's food and beer in the fridge.

39
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,496
The wash is done. Adolf's fed. The
grass is cut. It's all done, man.

40
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:15,457
Well, I guess you shouldn't
have finished so fast, huh?

41
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,878
Shut the fuck up.

42
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,754
- Never mind that. Never mind that.
- Shut the fuck up!

43
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,631
Get back to fucking work.

44
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:26,343
You want shit to do? Go wash the floors.
Scrub out the toilets.

45
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,597
Or better yet, pick up all the
dog shit in the backyard.

46
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,017
And if you finish too fast,
dump it out...

47
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,810
And pick it
back up again.

48
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,731
- Party's over, man.
- Shut the fuck up, Pick.

49
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:42,318
- I can get you a pooper scooper.
- Why are you so touchy?

50
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,278
- That's messed up, man.
- What?

51
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,782
When am I going
to get my money, Elvis? When?

52
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:51,202
I told you.
I get my check on Thursday.

53
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,078
All right. Well,
how much is the check?

54
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,955
I don't know.
It depends on the hours.

55
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,916
Well, how many hours
did you work, bitch?

56
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,168
I can't remember.

57
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,753
Fucking deadbeat, man.

58
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,422
Go on,
get the fuck out of here.

59
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:06,759
The walk of shame.
The walk of shame, man.

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,969
Yo! What up, little B?

61
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,764
- What up, B?
- It's 911.

62
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,103
$8,500.

63
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,397
All of it, huh?

64
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:23,275
- Surprise, surprise.
- Yeah.

65
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,445
Okay.

66
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,323
So?

67
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:31,825
So I got this guy.

68
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:35,621
He wants five.
Plus my regular two.

69
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:39,625
So I figure
I'm going to need seven.

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,419
I don't know, B. I don't...

71
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,506
I don't like having
that much shit out.

72
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:49,218
I'm going to see my guy on Monday
and I'll clear you right out, man.

73
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,596
He's good for it, Johnny.

74
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,017
You don't need to tell him
I'm good for it, man.

75
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,646
I'm not looking
for any fucking favors, J.T.

76
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,315
If it makes sense, do it.

77
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,568
If not, fuck it.

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,493
All right.

79
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,579
We'll try it.

80
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,082
Where are you going, right?

81
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,126
That's what
I'm talking about.

82
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,755
But come Friday,

83
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,507
I don't want to hear
any fucking stories.

84
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,012
You won't.

85
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,390
Be ready, be ready.

86
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,726
Soft hands, right?
Soft hands.

87
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:52,072
Nice. Nice. That's major league
stuff right there, baby.

88
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:54,658
Grab a bat,
and I'll throw you a couple.

89
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:02,416
What do you say, Tarzan?

91
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,918
I need seven.

92
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,544
Seven?

93
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:08,339
- Seven? Who?
- Bobby "911".

94
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,008
Yeah? Well,
we could put together.

95
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,384
I don't want
to get picked off.

96
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:13,677
All right.

97
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,223
- You know where he's been?
- Yeah.

98
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:22,478
I mean, I don't know,
but it feels good.

99
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,941
All right.
It's on you anyway, right?

100
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:29,068
It always is, Pop.

101
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,905
Hey, look at this kid. How handsome he is.
Look at this!

102
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:35,157
You must be knocking them dead.
You knocking them dead?

103
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,909
No. Let go of me.

104
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:39,870
So, what are you doing tonight?
You chasing tail?

105
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,373
No, I'm just chilling.

106
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,583
On a Friday night?

107
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,419
- Sonny?
- I know. I know.

108
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:51,006
Don't make me wonder about you, kid.
You sound like half a fucking fag.

109
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,801
- Always had my suspicions.
- Just make the fucking call.

110
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:56,637
Wait a minute.
Remember what I told you.

111
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,851
Men are not supposed to be monopolous.
It's in our nature to spread the seed.

112
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,395
Yeah, very poetic.
Come on. Come on.

113
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:09,358
Angela's a nice girl and all, but you
got to plow some fucking fields!

114
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,152
Did you hear me,
you fucking fruitcake?

115
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,196
Come on, buddy.

116
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,532
- He's a great kid.
- Yeah, he is.

117
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,053
Hello?

118
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,722
Hey!

119
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:07,101
We didn't expect
to see you. Come on in.

120
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,646
- Hi. You hungry?
- Yeah.

121
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,606
There's plenty of food.

122
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:14,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,779
- I like your hair, Jakey.
- Thank you.

124
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,370
- You look handsome with a little hair.
- Thank you.

125
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,748
- What's going on with the job?
- Lot of sales. Really busy.

126
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,043
Just, everything's going
really great.

127
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,421
How's your mother?

128
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,131
Wonderful, thank you.

129
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,425
- Tell her I said hello.
- I'll do...

130
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,178
- And Wanda?
- She's fine.

131
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:44,180
Could I talk to you
for a second?

132
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,266
Yeah, sure.

133
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,686
Excuse us.

134
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,326
I need to borrow money.

135
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,411
I thought we talked
about this.

136
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,079
Yeah.

137
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,789
You haven't paid me back
for the last time.

138
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:12,958
I know. I'm sorry. I...

139
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,086
It's not the money. You
know that, don't you, Son?

140
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,590
I just can't keep
bailing you out all the time.

141
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,634
I know, man!
I mean, do you...

142
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:25,638
Do you think I'd fucking be here if
this wasn't the last stop on earth?

143
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,811
How much?

144
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,147
800 bucks.

145
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:37,775
Hey.

146
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:41,946
- What's going on?
- Jake wants to borrow money.

147
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,448
How many times are we
going to do this, Butch?

148
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,741
Kid comes in here
stoned out of his mind,

149
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:48,285
and you keep throwing money at him
because you don't want to deal with it.

150
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,913
I'm working! I have a job.

151
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,250
- I'll pay you back.
- No.

152
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,710
No, I can't do it, Son.

153
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:00,798
Right. Sorry to interrupt. Go back
to your perfect little family.

154
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,466
- That's not fair.
- Don't fucking touch me!

155
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,649
Hey. Can I come with you?

156
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:21,110
No, kid, not tonight.
I got some shit to do.

157
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,028
Okay.

158
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,657
Yeah.

159
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,118
You okay? You all right?

160
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,828
Yeah.

161
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,747
- Okay, well, page me later.
- Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:34,957
Okay.

163
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,251
- I love you.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,294
Yeah.

165
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:48,679
Punk-ass bitches.

166
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,814
Look at these
fucking wannabe motherfuckers

167
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:02,693
with their fucking guns
and their fucking gold chains.

168
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:06,030
They got nothing!
They're worthless!

169
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:10,701
The only thing these motherfuckers
are shooting are music videos, dawg.

170
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,328
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what I'm saying.

171
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,371
That's what
I've been saying all along.

172
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,373
That's what
I'm talking about.

173
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:22,129
- Now I'm feeling it.
- Now I'm feeling it.

174
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:27,092
Now I'm feeling it, bitches.
You don't want that shit.

175
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,135
No!

176
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:31,555
You don't want that shit.
You don't want that shit.

177
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,848
Go, Elvis!

178
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,601
Dance, bitch!

179
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:49,573
You want to call me out?
You want to call me out? Okay.

180
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,408
Yeah, I want to call you out.

181
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:55,246
- I want to call you out.
- I want to call you out.

182
00:14:55,329 --> 00:15:00,334
- Oh, that is so nasty!
- Hey, you know he has herpes, right?

183
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:04,880
Bring it on!

184
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,010
I'm fucking high, dawg.

185
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:14,098
I can't even... I can't even
see you right now.

186
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,850
You ain't shit, Elvis!
Go back to your shelf.

187
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:19,687
Yeah, dance, bitch.

188
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:22,064
He's so fucking
brain-dead.

189
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:24,692
Rape her more!
Rape her more!

190
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,402
Oh, shit!

191
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,613
Come here.

192
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,914
I need a fucking beer.

193
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,168
<i>Hey, would you
get me a cerveza?</i>

194
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,837
- Oh, you need a beer, Johnny?
- I'll get you a beer.

195
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,965
Don't worry about it, Angie.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

196
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,758
Yo, I got it, Johnny.

197
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:52,553
- Run, bitch.
- Bitch, we're fucking thirsty.

198
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:56,724
Look at that slave-ass motherfucker.
"I got it, Johnny."

199
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,475
He's like a spook, man.

200
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,811
He loves Johnny.

201
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:03,606
Yes, he does.
Don't you, Elvis?

202
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:06,358
- What?
- You love him, motherfucker. Johnny?

203
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,819
Yeah, I do.
I love him a lot.

204
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:15,534
I owe him a lot. I do.

205
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:18,204
No, no, no.
I don't mean like that.

206
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:21,415
I mean you fucking love him.

207
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,250
You'd fucking do
anything for him.

208
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,795
If he asked you to suck his
cock, you probably would.

209
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,008
Shut the fuck up.

210
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,719
No, no, no.
Tell the truth, Elvis.

211
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,472
Tell me you wouldn't drop
to your fucking knees

212
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:39,558
and suck Johnny's cock in two
seconds, if he asked you.

213
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:42,853
You'd give it a kiss on the tip.
I bet you would, motherfucker.

214
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,813
- No, I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't?

215
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,941
Johnny, come on, man.

216
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:48,692
Oh, you see that?

217
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,653
Dude, you are
a fucking full-on

218
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,822
dick-in-the-mouth, balls-across-the-nose,
dildo-up-the-ass...

219
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:54,949
Fag!

220
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,701
- You're a faggot, dude. 100 percent.
- You're a fag.

221
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,078
Shut the fuck up,
bitch. Suck my cock.

222
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,704
You know what? Don't talk
to me anymore, okay?

223
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,540
- I fuck bitches. You're a homo.
- Suck my cock.

224
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,250
That's it.

225
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,169
- That's fucking mean.
- Shut the fuck up!

226
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,796
Suck my fucking cock.

227
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,799
Come on, Schmidt,
I'm dead serious.

228
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,425
Suck it, bitch.

229
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,761
Suck my fucking cock.

230
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,096
I got it.

231
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,222
Come on, do it!

232
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,350
No, I got it, all right?
Suck my cock.

233
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:25,896
Pretty soon it's going
to come out, Elvis.

234
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,607
Pretty soon you're
going to come out, Elvis.

235
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:29,984
That you're fucking gay.

236
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,944
What up, Jake?

237
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:34,655
You got to start calling a
motherfucker before you just show up.

238
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:36,866
- Christ-killers ain't got no respect.
- Yeah.

239
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:40,077
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What's up, Jake?

240
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,121
Oh, shit! Yo, come here, man. Elvis
is just about to suck a dick.

241
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:43,330
Yeah.
Let's go on in here.

242
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:45,249
So what's going on, homie?

243
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:48,878
You know that thing I told you I was going
to take care for you down in San Diego?

244
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,422
- Yeah.
- It's a washout.

245
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,299
Really? What happened?

246
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,968
Well, I go down there
and I put the screws to him.

247
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:57,553
And I tell him, something bad
is gonna happen to him,

248
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,472
unless he comes up with your
money, and, like, fast.

249
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,474
Which he doesn't,
because he's fucking tapped.

250
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,101
But he's scared,
so he leans on his neighbor,

251
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,812
and I walk on the guy
for 150 bombs.

252
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,564
So?

253
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,153
So, the bombs are no good.
The X was fucking bunk.

254
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,863
And I had a guy lined up
to take it all, man.

255
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,574
We would have made
so much money on that shit.

256
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:22,953
But you said that you would take care
of it. You said that it was your debt.

257
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:24,288
Are you coming in here,
trying to nigger-talk me?

258
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,208
What do you want me to do? I can't exactly
go back to the guy that I ripped off

259
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,334
and say, "Yo dude,
your shit was no good."

260
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,503
Okay, well,
I still got to get paid.

261
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:33,506
I know. Calm the fuck down.
I got $800.

262
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,967
And I thought
that we could split it.

263
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,011
You thought
we could split it?

264
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,014
Fuck that.
Pay me all of it.

265
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:43,140
- I'm trying.
- How?

266
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,100
You make dog shit
at your fucking job.

267
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,602
Be careful, Johnny.
I'm not fucking Elvis.

268
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:47,937
Yeah, well,
you're short, asshole.

269
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,647
Watch your fucking mouth,
you little fucking midget.

270
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,399
I'm not one of
your little faggot friends.

271
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,360
And remember
who you're talking to.

272
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,320
Give me
my fucking money!

273
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,156
You're going
to stiff me, huh?

274
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,618
I'm going
to fucking kill you!

275
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:16,382
Take a fucking drink,
you motherfucker.

276
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,551
Why don't you fucking die?

277
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:21,095
I'm going to kill you,
you fucking bitch!

278
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:29,061
- Take your fucking hands off him!
- Get back!

279
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:30,813
You motherfucker!

280
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:34,024
You motherfucker!
You motherfucker!

281
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,696
Oh, fuck, Frankie. Get
this fucking bitch off me.

282
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,200
- Fucking psycho, man.
- Get the fuck off, bitch!

283
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:46,078
Who do you think you're messing
with, you fucking cocksucker?

284
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:47,872
Get away from me.

285
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,832
Sit the fuck down,
you crazy bitch!

286
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:50,958
Piece of shit.

287
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,794
- Whoa, goddamn it, man!
- All right, motherfucker!

288
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:56,547
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, man.

289
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,633
You point that thing at me, you
better pull the fucking trigger!

290
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:01,969
Well, come on,
you fucking pussy, do it!

291
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,304
Come on, bitch!

292
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,932
Why don't you try me,
you fucking kike?

293
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:09,435
- I will! I will!
- I love it.

294
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,855
You have everyone else fooled around
here, but I ain't fucking buying it.

295
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,773
Get this fucking piece
of shit out of my house.

296
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:17,067
Get the fuck out, dawg!

297
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,278
All right, Johnny.

298
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,199
It's on.
Ain't no turning back now.

299
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,742
Get the fuck
out of here!

300
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,869
Fucking walk away, okay?

301
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:28,829
Come on.

302
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,499
Whoa!

303
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,463
Fuck me.

304
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:45,179
Bitch, shut up.

305
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,311
What's going on?

306
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:59,735
- Who's there?
- It's Zack.

307
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:02,321
- Who? It's fucking midnight!
- It's me, Zack.

308
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,199
Get in here.

309
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,954
What are you doing,
you fucking maniac?

310
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,790
Hi! Hi!

311
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,170
Okay. Go put on some clothes.
My brother's here.

312
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,422
<i>Heil! Yes, sir!</i>

313
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:31,225
- You want a drink?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,816
And she's always
telling me what to do.

315
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,487
Like what clothes to wear and
what girls she thinks are pretty.

316
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:46,115
Like I couldn't fucking
figure it out for myself!

317
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:48,534
That's your mom.
That's Olivia.

318
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:51,912
Come on, she loves you.
You're her baby.

319
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:53,831
Yeah, I know.

320
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,833
It's embarrassing.

321
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,962
Do you know that
we have homework parties?

322
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:02,923
- What?
- Homework parties with little hats.

323
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:04,592
No.

324
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,051
- Yeah.
- Like...

325
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:09,096
- Yeah.
- ...for birthdays?

326
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,223
Yeah! Yeah!

327
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,766
Another thing.

328
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,437
I'll be sleeping, right?

329
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,108
And she'll wake me up
by looking at me.

330
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,238
Like I'll open my eyes, and she'll be
right there looking at me, like...

331
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,658
Fucking A!

332
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:33,704
It's goddamn creepy, you know. Like she's
in love with me, and breathing on me!

333
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,581
You're lucky, you know that.

334
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,876
I mean, my mother,
she'd never...

335
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:45,049
Boo-hoo for me!

336
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,550
Yeah, I know.

337
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:50,471
But, you know,
I'd trade you.

338
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,849
I just got to get out.

339
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,562
Wow, I'm drunk.
I got to smoke.

340
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:02,274
Well.

341
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:04,735
Look at Zacky! All grown up!

342
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:09,240
Look at his little one-hitter
and his stress weed.

343
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:11,909
Shut up.

344
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:24,672
Take a drink.

345
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:31,095
Like a pro.

346
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,560
Wacky Zacky.

347
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,479
That's me.

348
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:42,940
Wacky Zacky.

349
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:53,909
Hello?

350
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,578
<i>Wanda, put my kid
on the phone. Now.</i>

351
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:57,454
One minute.

352
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:02,376
- It's Olivia.
- No, no. Fucking A!

353
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,919
All right, give it to me.

354
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:08,799
Hello?

355
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:13,345
<i>Zack was supposed to be home
two hours ago. Is he with you?</i>

356
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:16,891
- Yeah, he's here.
- Fucking A, dude.

357
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,810
No, we're talking.

358
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:22,146
<i>- I said we're talking.
- Put him on the phone...</i>

359
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:25,482
Don't get your panties all in a wad,
Olivia. I'll drive him home later.

360
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,026
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

361
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,612
Yes, I do know
what time it is, thank you.

362
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:33,240
<i>Put my son on the phone or I am coming
over there right now, God damn it.</i>

363
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:34,450
Yeah, okay.

364
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:37,453
Yeah, okay. All right!

365
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,789
You got to go home.

366
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,670
- No!
- Wait, no, stop!

367
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:49,840
Come on, Zack!
Tonight we ride!

368
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,764
- Come on.
- No!

369
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:58,432
Come on.

370
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:00,392
Jake. Hey, Jake.

371
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,937
- Jake, am I a funny guy?
- You're hysterical.

372
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,856
- Am I a good guy?
- You're the best.

373
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,399
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you are a good guy.

374
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:09,318
- You are the best, man.
- Oh, boy.

375
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,695
- Get inside.
- Oh, Dad!

376
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:15,825
You wanted him,
you got him.

377
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,034
Hi!

378
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,286
Bye!

379
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,914
You're a real son of a
bitch, you know that?

380
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,460
Come on!

381
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,813
I was fucking my dog
one time, right?

382
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,398
No, no, no. Hey...

383
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:51,068
Hey, look at the caboose
on that one.

384
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:53,821
I could crack that open
like a peach.

385
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,657
Are you fucking kidding me?

386
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,910
You are a fucking dinosaur,
Cosmo.

387
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:03,998
Come on. You're dead.
You can't do anything.

388
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,334
Your balls
are all wrinkled up.

389
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:08,502
- What?
- What?

390
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,671
"What?" You deaf fuck.
I said you're old.

391
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:14,383
I can knock the bottom
out of her.

392
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,636
You don't even know what a bottom is.
You don't know what to do.

393
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,679
Balls deep.

394
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,140
Hey, waitress!

395
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:24,059
What can I do for you?
What did you have in mind?

396
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,439
Just get another
round of drinks.

397
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,317
- You haven't finished the last ones.
- I didn't ask you that.

398
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,069
- Just get us some more fucking drinks.
- Get us some drinks, bitch!

399
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,530
Come on.
Mind your manners.

400
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,699
We're fine.
Just give me the bill.

401
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:41,535
Hey, no, Dad.
Come on, I got it.

402
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:45,039
Oh, you got it, huh? What are you...
Look at this guy.

403
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,000
- Special occasion.
- Big spender over here!

404
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:55,132
- Come on, Cos, let's go.
- Johnny says we're leaving, let's go!

405
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,051
Hey, Johnny,
watch this.

406
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:03,182
- Tell Jake we stopped in.
- Oh, I will.

407
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:13,984
When I told Jake what happened,
he fucking flipped out.

408
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:15,361
And I had to calm him down.

409
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:16,737
He was going to kill Johnny.

410
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,739
Jake's like that. He's a
very passionate person.

411
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,868
But I told him, "No. If
you're gonna do something,

412
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,120
"you got to fucking
hit him where it hurts."

413
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:28,499
Johnny had a car stolen
by a mutual acquaintance,

414
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,918
and he was trying to collect
on the insurance money.

415
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:35,631
Jake comes in,
salts the whole fucking deal,

416
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:38,384
insurance company
catches wind of it,

417
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:40,803
they don't pay out.

418
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:43,931
Costs Johnny $30,000.

419
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:47,351
Of course, Johnny had to retaliate.
It's fucking business.

420
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:49,520
Mr. Johansson
wants to see you.

421
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:53,274
You wanted to see me?

422
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,277
Sit down.

423
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,535
What's up, Pete?

424
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:06,078
Your probation officer called.

425
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:09,999
You talked to Mr. Lampington?
I thought he was out of town.

426
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:12,042
Yeah. Well,
I talked to him.

427
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:15,296
He says you've been getting
into trouble again.

428
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:18,382
Breaking into houses,
using drugs. Speed, mainly.

429
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,633
It's not true.

430
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:21,719
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

431
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,263
Pete, I swear to God.

432
00:28:24,722 --> 00:28:27,600
Dude. Dude! It's...

433
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,438
I feel you. I'm right here.

434
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:35,232
Don't look at me that way. I'm
telling you the fucking truth!

435
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,943
I'm totally
fucking straight, man!

436
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:39,486
I mean, I'm a little...

437
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,947
Mr. Lampington is so full of shit.
He's out of fucking town.

438
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,824
How would he know
what I'm doing?

439
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:48,746
- You disappoint me.
- Pete.

440
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:50,873
Pete.

441
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,751
I swear to fucking God.

442
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,086
I need you
to take a drug test.

443
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,630
Pete, come on.

444
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:00,466
I need this job.
I need this job.

445
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,968
- I really need this job.
- Fill it up.

446
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,262
I need this fucking job!

447
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,098
Back off!

448
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,268
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

449
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:13,646
Get the fuck out of here!
You're fired!

450
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:17,233
Get your shit and get out!
Do not let him back in here!

451
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:20,110
I will take you down
to hell with me!

452
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:21,862
Get the fuck out of here!

453
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:25,115
I will take you down
to fucking hell with me!

454
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,453
I will take you down
to hell with me!

455
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:44,051
You want to play some games, Truelove?
Let's play some motherfucking games.

456
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:04,488
Motherfucker. Fuck that!

457
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,667
Where's this motherfucker?

458
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,630
Where you at? Johnny?

459
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,174
- Johnny!
- Go check the bathroom.

460
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,550
Johnny!

461
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,387
Jake!

462
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,014
Truelove!

463
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,059
Truelove!

464
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,564
- Oh, shit, look at this fucking TV!
- Fuck the TV.

465
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:43,986
Shut the fuck up!
Shoot the fucking...

466
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,489
Fuck the motherfucking dog,
man.

467
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:54,455
The bitch ain't here,
man. Let's get out of here.

468
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:02,046
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

469
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,381
What the fuck
did you eat, bro?

470
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,842
Be careful,
don't step on your own shit.

471
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:10,262
Oh, man, this fucker's
real heavy. Shit.

472
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:15,100
No, don't drop it. Wait.
Don't fucking drop it.

473
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:29,490
Yo, I'm keeping
this motherfucking TV.

474
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:31,408
Don't fuck with it. Don't
fuck with it, all right?

475
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,953
- You ready or what?
- Let's go, come on.

476
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:36,831
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Let's go!

477
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:54,390
Fiesta, motherfuckers,
we ready?

478
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:56,725
Yo, what the fuck, dude?

479
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,769
We're moving, bro.

480
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,313
- Moving?
- Goddamn right.

481
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:05,192
It's too fucking hot. Too many
assholes know where I live.

482
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:06,652
You see this?

483
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:10,990
Holy shit!

484
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:14,201
Yo, Johnny,
what happened, man?

485
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,537
I come home last night.

486
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,081
My window was busted
and my TV is missing.

487
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,167
- Fuck, right?
- Fuck!

488
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,169
- Tell him about the shit.
- The shit?

489
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,673
Fucking crackhead Mazursky took a
sideways shit on the living room carpet.

490
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,925
- What? Where?
- Right here.

491
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,803
On the wet spot.

492
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:36,182
A big fucking steaming crap.

493
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,225
Longways, like this, dawg.

494
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,644
- That's fucked up.
- Is that nuts or what?

495
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:43,355
What this motherfucker
wipe his ass with? His hand?

496
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:46,150
I don't know, fucko.
I told you I wasn't here.

497
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,694
Whatever. That fool
is fucking nasty, man.

498
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,113
Check this shit out.

499
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:53,616
<i>Sunday, 12:00 a.m.</i>

500
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:57,870
<i>This is just the beginning, bitch.
This is Li'l Shooter.</i>

501
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:01,707
<i>You're dead, homes. You
hear me, you fucking dwarf?</i>

502
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,083
<i>I know where
your mother lives.</i>

503
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,545
<i>I know where your brother lives.
I know where your papi lives.</i>

504
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:10,174
<i>We going to play some games,
motherfucker!</i>

505
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:13,219
- Mazursky, right?
- Can you believe that shit?

506
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:15,846
After everything I've done
for that motherfucker?

507
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,682
Look, Johnny, fuck him.

508
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:23,103
Let's get the hell out of Dodge.
Go to Fiesta. Fuck some bitches.

509
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:25,564
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Right?

510
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:28,275
Let's run through some shit!

511
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,653
Schmitty, we're going to go to
the Springs for a couple days.

512
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,571
You stay here and get everything
all boxed up and out.

513
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:34,740
I don't want to see shit here
when I get back, okay?

514
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:38,369
- All right.
- All right. I want a receipt, too.

515
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:43,374
Yeah, and maybe if you guys are
still there when I get finished,

516
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,501
I'll cruise down there.

517
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:49,088
- Yeah. Maybe you can blow me.
- Fuck you, dick. I wanna come.

518
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:53,717
Yeah, yeah. Just make sure you get the
shit smell out of the carpet, bitch!

519
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,012
I don't get it.
What are we doing?

520
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:59,431
Let's go break
this fucking guy's head.

521
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,828
Mazursky!

522
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:24,957
He's not here.

523
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:29,420
I'm telling you, he's gone, man.
Look, his car is not even here.

524
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,005
That don't mean shit.

525
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,428
There's not even
any fucking lights on.

526
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,557
How are the lights going to be on?
It's the middle of the fucking day.

527
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,644
What the fuck are we doing?

528
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:49,106
I don't know, but I'm not standing
here like a fucking idiot.

529
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:03,746
- What are you doing?
- I'm just kidding.

530
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:06,457
All right,
so quit fucking around.

531
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,875
Hey! Yo, J!

532
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,544
Check it out.

533
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:14,965
97 miles an hour,
motherfucker!

534
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,967
- Okay.
- Let's see what you got.

535
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:24,850
Manny motherfucking Ramirez,
motherfucker!

536
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:27,144
You guys are fucking idiots.

537
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,865
Jesus! Make more noise.

538
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,201
He's 15. You remember
when you were 15?

539
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:45,913
You know what? For once in your
life, your tennis match will wait.

540
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:49,917
Why do you have to be such a fucking pussy?
What are you thinking?

541
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,043
What are you
getting crazy about?

542
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:52,711
- It's not that big a deal.
- I am not crazy!

543
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,088
- If you were ever here...
- Would you just leave it?

544
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:55,714
...you might notice that.

545
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:58,884
- Oh, great. Let's just let him turn out like...
- Like what, Olivia? Like who?

546
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:01,303
- Like what?
- Say it. Like Jake?

547
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,097
Hey.

548
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:05,683
What's going on?

549
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:09,228
Oh, jeez.

550
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:11,272
Come here.

551
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,190
Come here.

552
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,617
Your mother found this
in your room.

553
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:26,036
- It's a pipe.
- I know what it is. It's a bong.

554
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,288
- You want to tell me about it?
- No.

555
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,539
- You smoking pot?
- No.

556
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,332
Now, look at me!
We have to talk, Son.

557
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,667
I don't want
to fucking talk, Dad.

558
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,002
Well, that's too bad.
Sit down.

559
00:36:33,085 --> 00:36:35,379
Dad! I just fucking woke up!

560
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:38,591
Goddamn it! Let me put
some fucking clothes on.

561
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,968
God! Fucking dick!

562
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:58,861
Yes, he should be grounded. He
should be something, for God's sake!

563
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:03,616
Zack, come down here!

564
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:05,951
Zack?

565
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,728
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

566
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:35,272
That's Tattooey's brother.
Pull over.

567
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:38,484
Hey, what's up?
Come here.

568
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:42,238
Come here,
you little fucker.

569
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:44,949
What the fuck
you running for, bitch?

570
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:51,539
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.

571
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:55,918
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
I didn't fucking do anything.

572
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,671
Shut the fuck up
and get in the fucking van!

573
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:17,815
Fucking idiot.

574
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,698
Just take him to your place.

575
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,617
We can't take him to my place.
I told you, my dad's there.

576
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,286
I thought you said
he was cool.

577
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:31,871
Bitch, he is cool.
But you didn't tell me

578
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:33,497
we'd be bringing along
a fucking hostage!

579
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:35,207
Dude, he's not a hostage,
all right?

580
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,711
I told you, I don't know what
I'm doing right now, all right.

581
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,838
- I'm thinking.
- Well, think.

582
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,886
Well... Hey,
we got to take him someplace.

583
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,558
All right.
I know somewhere we can go.

584
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,602
But you got to be
fucking cool.

585
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:05,070
- Yeah?
- Yo!

586
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:08,657
Hey, what's up, man?

587
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:10,910
- What's up, Chucky?
- What's up, bro?

588
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,830
- Lot of dudes, bro.
- I know, man.

589
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:16,624
All right. Bring them in.

590
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:23,547
Hey, Chuck, this is Truelove, the
guy I was telling you about.

591
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,050
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Do you have a room we could use?

592
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,135
- A room?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:31,305
Yeah, I got one
all the way down to the left.

594
00:39:31,388 --> 00:39:32,598
Thanks.

595
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:44,568
So, what's up, man?

596
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:46,695
You know,
we're just chilling, man.

597
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,074
- Getting high. Getting ready to go to Fiesta.
- Smoking weed.

598
00:39:51,116 --> 00:39:52,535
Thanks, man.

599
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:57,873
So, how you been?

600
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:01,252
Been good. Chilling.
Ripping waves. Hanging out.

601
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,634
Yo! What the fuck is going on
back there, man?

602
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:09,885
Do you want me
to go check it out?

603
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:14,223
Yeah. I mean, four dudes I've never
met are in my fucking bedroom.

604
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:15,474
Yeah.

605
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:24,233
- Give me your hands.
- Give me the tape.

606
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:27,111
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

607
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,613
Are you nuts?
You can't do that!

608
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:34,076
- You guys are out of your fucking mind.
- What the hell is this?

609
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,786
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut up.

610
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,621
Hey, Chucky, they got a kid
tied up in your bedroom!

611
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:38,914
- Hey, calm down.
- There's a kid!

612
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:40,457
- What?
- It's not like that.

613
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:43,586
- Johnny's just a little crazy right now.
- A little crazy right now?

614
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:44,753
- We stole this kid...
- What?

615
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:46,213
- I don't know...
- Hey!

616
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,299
I thought I told you
to shut your mouth.

617
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:50,301
And you
mind your fucking business.

618
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:53,429
Mind my business?
This is my fucking house!

619
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:57,600
Frankie, you better put your boy in check.
Tell them what fucking time it is.

620
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,852
- Oh, it's like that, huh?
- Just like that, bitch.

621
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,897
I get it. Yo, Lump,
let's get out of here.

622
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,065
Yo! I'm going
to fucking Fiesta.

623
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:08,652
And when I get back, none of you
motherfuckers better be here.

624
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,615
Let's get out of here, girls.
Lump, let's go.

625
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,742
- Fuck.
- Fucking shitheads.

626
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:20,164
Hey, Chucky, man, I'm really
sorry about all this, bro.

627
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:25,794
Fuck!

628
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:38,807
What's going on?
Why aren't you guys ready?

629
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:42,770
- What are we going to do with the kid, man?
- Who cares?

630
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:46,190
Throw him in the fucking closet. Pick
him up later. Leave him in the van.

631
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,775
I don't give a fuck.

632
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,443
Hey, yo, Johnny.

633
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,904
I got a date
back in the Valley.

634
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:54,406
I got to get back, man.

635
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:56,826
Me, too.

636
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:58,828
You just remembered now, huh?

637
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:00,788
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

638
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,332
Hey, my girl gets mad
if I don't fuck her.

639
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:07,920
You pussies want to go home?
Fine. Take the fucking van.

640
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,130
Listen. You don't have
to do that, you know.

641
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:12,758
I mean, you can put me in a closet.
I'm not gonna run anywhere.

642
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:16,178
Do me a favor. Shut up before
I shut you the fuck up.

643
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,263
Johnny.

644
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:19,014
Why is this motherfucker
even talking, anyway?

645
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:21,141
I thought we taped him up.

646
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:23,185
He couldn't breathe.

647
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,566
Just drop me off on the strip.
I'm going to fucking Fiesta.

648
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:31,277
I'm not letting this little
motherfucker throw my weekend.

649
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,070
He couldn't breathe.

650
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:36,073
- What about me?
- No.

651
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,992
- No what?
- He stays with you.

652
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,076
What?

653
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,412
I said, "All fucking queers
are deaf," motherfucker.

654
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,956
- Why me, dude?
- Because I fucking said so.

655
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,708
Don't fuck around, man.

656
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,460
I can't fucking take him
to my dad's house like that.

657
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,921
Well, then, untie him, genius.

658
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:53,007
You heard the kid.
He ain't running, are you?

659
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,509
- What? No.
- There you go.

660
00:42:55,551 --> 00:43:00,306
Go home, tell Juergen he's your new little
butt buddy and he's spending the night.

661
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:02,349
Meanwhile,
I'll talk to Mazursky.

662
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,188
He must be going crazy
right now.

663
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:14,236
Hey, what's going on?

664
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:16,322
It's a madhouse.

665
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:19,950
Your brother's scaring
the shit out of all of us.

666
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:23,704
You try his friends?
Maybe he has a girl.

667
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:28,375
We've tried everything. Friends,
cops, hospitals. Nothing.

668
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:31,879
You don't think the kid's just,
like, out fucking around?

669
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:34,798
I mean, you can't keep the kid
locked in the house forever.

670
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:36,675
Maybe. I don't know.

671
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,137
We did have an argument
this morning.

672
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:42,515
Okay, well, that's what it is,
then, right?

673
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:44,141
I hope so.

674
00:43:44,225 --> 00:43:46,644
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know.

675
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:50,314
But, we can't
rule anything out, so...

676
00:43:54,777 --> 00:43:57,029
I have to ask you
a few questions.

677
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,323
- Okay?
- Okay.

678
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:02,993
You know anybody
who'd want to hurt Zack?

679
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:04,662
- No.
- You?

680
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:06,622
Me what?

681
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:09,458
You have a beef with anybody
I should know about?

682
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,711
- No.
- That person you owe money to?

683
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,255
You owe somebody money?

684
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:18,634
Oh, Jesus! You just tell me how
much and I will write the check.

685
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:21,470
- It's not really like that, Olivia.
- Really? What's it like?

686
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:25,683
Tell me what it's like, you...
Goddamn you! You fuck!

687
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:28,227
- Get him back here!
- Please relax.

688
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,312
Get him back here to me.

689
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,442
Bring him back here!

690
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:40,030
I'm going to find him,
I promise you.

691
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,741
I promise you.

692
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:45,744
I'll find him.

693
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:50,875
Where are you going?

694
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,675
De Rosa! Where's Johnny?

695
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:01,427
I don't know, dawg.
Is he here?

696
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,181
- That's what I'm asking you, "dawg"!
- Excuse me, we were talking.

697
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:08,684
- Klemash, where's the fucking crew?
- Man, I ain't seen them dudes.

698
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:11,645
What the fuck was that? You give me
your back? You turn away from me?

699
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:13,606
- Why are you tripping, homes?
- Back up, freak-ass!

700
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:14,899
Don't touch her!

701
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,901
You fucking asshole!

702
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:51,393
If anybody
sees Johnny Truelove,

703
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,274
tell them Jake Mazursky
is looking for him!

704
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:00,569
Thank you.

705
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,742
Hey, suck my dick!

706
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:13,916
Dude.

707
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:24,260
You better
back the fuck off me, man!

708
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:27,596
- I'm going to get a beer. You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

709
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,251
- Here you go, man.
- Thanks.

710
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:01,922
- Cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

711
00:47:02,006 --> 00:47:03,924
Fuck that.
It's good for you.

712
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:23,694
Hey, man,

713
00:47:25,654 --> 00:47:28,657
what if I said you could
walk over there right now,

714
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:31,076
jump on a bus,
catch a ride home?

715
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:37,458
I turn my back, tell Truelove you
fucking ran away or something.

716
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,294
What do you think about that?

717
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,595
I don't know, Frankie.

718
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:54,016
I mean, I don't want to cause any
problems for my brother, you know?

719
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:58,646
So, I think, I'm just going to
ride it out, see what happens.

720
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:00,105
All right?

721
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:03,108
All right.

722
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:04,819
All right.

723
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:25,005
Try and
keep it down, okay?

724
00:48:26,632 --> 00:48:27,633
Dad?

725
00:48:29,593 --> 00:48:30,761
Frankie?

726
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:33,138
Frankie.

727
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,809
- I'm so glad to see you, bro!
- I know.

728
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:39,228
- So glad. Oh, my beautiful baby!
- Come on, Dad, don't do that.

729
00:48:45,442 --> 00:48:48,070
Hey, come to bed.

730
00:48:49,947 --> 00:48:51,282
I love you.

731
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,051
I want you to meet
this beautiful...

732
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:12,511
All right, all right,
all right.

733
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:15,472
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, hi.

734
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:18,017
- Give her a kiss. Be a gentleman.
- Dad! Seriously!

735
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,768
Just fucking
join in the fun, man.

736
00:49:19,852 --> 00:49:21,395
No, you have fun.
I'm gonna go.

737
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:25,107
- Let me go, Dad.
- No, stay! The party's just getting started.

738
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:27,526
Come on, man, smoke a
doobie with your old man!

739
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:28,819
- Have a drink!
- No!

740
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:31,280
- Come on. Something.
- No, Dad. Come on.

741
00:49:31,363 --> 00:49:34,200
Who's your little friend?
You babysitting?

742
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:35,618
Fuck you!

743
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:40,498
- Take the couch.
- All right.

744
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,541
- You good?
- Yeah.

745
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,196
Wake up.

746
00:50:13,572 --> 00:50:15,407
Come on, you got
chores to do. Let's go.

747
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:17,993
- Hello?
- I fucking hear you!

748
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:21,288
There's coffee. But Destiny got up late,
so I need you to straighten up the house.

749
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:23,332
I'm supposed to clean up
after your party?

750
00:50:23,374 --> 00:50:27,044
I'm hung over like a bitch. Don't
argue with me. I'm in no mood.

751
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:30,256
Hey, look, I come home here yesterday,
and your shit's all over the house!

752
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:33,217
We had a deal, remember?
You get a job, you pay rent,

753
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,760
- or you work here.
- All right! Fuck!

754
00:50:34,844 --> 00:50:37,346
- Get out of my room!
- Nice fucking mouth.

755
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,142
Fucking dick.

756
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:45,271
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'll help you with the work.

757
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:50,067
Juergen's a botanist. He grows
everything we eat right here.

758
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:53,529
Tomatoes, cucumbers, corn.

759
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,115
Fucking spices and shit.

760
00:50:56,198 --> 00:50:59,410
Motherfucker's a full-blown
alcoholic, smokes like a chimney,

761
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:02,079
but goddamn if we don't
eat healthy, right?

762
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:06,417
Oh, yeah. Look at
this shit right here.

763
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,336
- Oh, boy!
- Daddy's pride and joy.

764
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,463
Of course, that greedy bastard
will smoke them all,

765
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,799
but it's Frankie's job
to take care of them.

766
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:17,052
Water them, pull the males, throw a little
eggshells on them, every now and then.

767
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:19,221
- Dope.
- Yeah, right?

768
00:51:19,263 --> 00:51:21,390
Well, fuck it.
Let's get to work.

769
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:38,532
- Shit. I'll be right back.
- All right.

770
00:51:43,662 --> 00:51:44,705
<i>- Hello.
- Hey!</i>

771
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:46,540
<i>- Hey, girl.
- What's going on?</i>

772
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:49,126
Nothing. Working.
You guys coming over?

773
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,337
<i>- You got that shit?
- You know I do.</i>

774
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:54,507
- Mom, we're going to Frankie's!
- Hey, did you talk to him?

775
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,091
It's all good.

776
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:59,803
- When will you be home?
- I don't know. Late, probably.

777
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:02,890
Darling, can you stay with
Julie and Sabrina tonight?

778
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:05,434
It's your father
and my anniversary.

779
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:06,852
Anniversary.

780
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:09,730
- You going to have a little sex or...
- That's disgusting!

781
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:11,774
Whatever. I'm interested.

782
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:13,901
I mean, really. Are you
going to go down on him?

783
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:18,072
- Give him a little tubesteak boogie?
- No.

784
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:20,115
Oh, come on. Live a little.

785
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:23,077
I mean, you guys have been
married, what, like, 500 years?

786
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:24,703
Keith Stratten!

787
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:27,331
I will smack the shit out
of you, you little skunk!

788
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:29,333
All right, okay,
we're leaving.

789
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,919
You got your keys. Let's
go get Sabrina and Julie.

790
00:52:32,002 --> 00:52:33,087
Bye.

791
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:56,569
Hey! Yo! Yo! Youngblood!
Come here, man. Come here.

792
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:01,740
- Ladies. Dickwad.
- Fuck you.

793
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,493
- Susan.
- Hi.

794
00:53:04,577 --> 00:53:06,620
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sabrina. Julie.

795
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:10,166
- Dickwad.
- Hey, buddy. Fucking Keith, man.

796
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:12,585
Okay, okay, let's go smoke
some fucking weed, man!

797
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:14,128
- All right. Yo!
- Hey, but listen.

798
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,338
- No!
- Nobody mess up my shit, all right?

799
00:53:16,422 --> 00:53:19,216
This house has never been
so fucking clean.

800
00:53:22,052 --> 00:53:23,762
- Fuck you, dude.
- You fucking suck at these games.

801
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:27,224
- You suck.
- You fucking blow at this game, dude.

802
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:29,810
I don't fucking blow.
You just died, man!

803
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,938
- I thought I was the other guy.
- No, dude, that's me.

804
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,569
- I thought I was playing the other dude.
- No. Fuck you, dude.

805
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:40,529
You're fucking high, dude.

806
00:53:40,613 --> 00:53:44,992
- Yeah, I'm high.
- I'm ruined after five minutes of this shit.

807
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:47,119
This shit is creepy
as a motherfucker.

808
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:50,164
- You're a lightweight, dawg.
- I'm not a lightweight.

809
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:55,669
- Suck my balls.
- Dude, fuck you. Suck my balls, man!

810
00:53:55,753 --> 00:53:58,672
You suck it, bitch.
You fucking wimp.

811
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:03,802
- So, how old are you?
- How old do I look?

812
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:05,513
About 12.

813
00:54:05,596 --> 00:54:08,432
Oh, well, I'm 17,
but I do look really young.

814
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:13,854
I'm gonna kill your ass.
I'm gonna kill your ass.

815
00:54:13,938 --> 00:54:17,066
Answer your phone.
Go. Go answer your phone!

816
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:19,109
- Suck it! Suck it! Suck it!
- No, bitch, fuck you!

817
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:20,236
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

818
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,113
Hello? Yo, Johnny! What's up?
Have you talked to anybody?

819
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:24,323
<i>Not yet. Why?</i>

820
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:26,909
Look, man. I can't keep
the kid here much longer.

821
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:28,369
<i>- Why?
- Nothing.</i>

822
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:30,496
I'm just having
some people over.

823
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:32,122
<i>- What?
- Nobody. Shut up!</i>

824
00:54:32,164 --> 00:54:34,166
<i>- What? Are you crazy?
- Nobody. Just some people.</i>

825
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:36,043
<i>Dude, I didn't tell you
to play fucking grab-ass!</i>

826
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:37,127
Chill out, dawg.

827
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:39,421
<i>No, fuck that! Get everyone
the fuck out of there!</i>

828
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:41,924
All right. All right.
I'll clear it out.

829
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:47,847
I need you to do
a favor for me, bro.

830
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,765
Johnny's coming over
and I need the house.

831
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:51,976
Will you watch the kid for me
for a little while?

832
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,103
- Watch him?
- Yeah. Keep an eye on him.

833
00:54:54,186 --> 00:54:56,147
No phones
and no leaving him alone.

834
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,898
No phones?

835
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,818
I don't get it.

836
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:05,865
All right, look. If I tell you something,
can you keep your fucking mouth shut?

837
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:08,826
Yeah, of course, man. Yeah.

838
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:13,414
The kid's older brother
owes Truelove money

839
00:55:13,497 --> 00:55:17,543
and Johnny's holding him like a marker
or something, until he gets paid.

840
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:23,090
That's fucked up.

841
00:55:23,174 --> 00:55:25,217
No. No, bitch,
it's not like that.

842
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:28,888
The kid knows what's happening,
and he's cool with it.

843
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:31,932
I mean, look at the motherfucker.
He ain't going nowhere.

844
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:37,313
Just take him someplace, hang out,
bring him back in a couple of hours.

845
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:39,690
Can you do that for me?

846
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,609
I don't know, man.

847
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:45,988
It sounds
pretty fucking dubious.

848
00:55:46,697 --> 00:55:50,576
Keith, who the fuck
are you talking to, man?

849
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:55,289
If I tell you something's
good, then that's what it is.

850
00:55:55,998 --> 00:55:58,876
Are you going to take care
of this for me or not?

851
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:02,046
Susan, I swear to God,
it's cool. Trust me.

852
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:04,340
- Would you fucking calm down?
- Hey! Fuck you! Let go of me!

853
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,382
You're not supposed to know
any of this.

854
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:06,842
Jesus, don't say anything,
okay?

855
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:08,052
You're gonna get me
in a lot of fucking trouble.

856
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:10,596
From who, Keith? From your little
fucking gangster friends from L.A.?

857
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:11,680
Yeah! From my...

858
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,766
- Oh, I'm real scared!
- Well, you fucking should be.

859
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:15,809
You're a little fucking
faggot, you know that?

860
00:56:15,893 --> 00:56:17,895
Whoa, you guys, dude,
what's going on?

861
00:56:17,937 --> 00:56:20,481
- This kid has been kidnapped!
- No, he hasn't!

862
00:56:20,564 --> 00:56:24,193
- You mean like "abducted" kidnapped?
- Fucking stolen! Ask him.

863
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,279
Yeah.

864
00:56:27,404 --> 00:56:28,489
Yeah, they took me. But

865
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,199
it's okay.

866
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:32,034
They took you? Why?

867
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:34,203
Because his scumbag brother
owes Johnny Truelove money.

868
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:35,329
Shut up!

869
00:56:35,412 --> 00:56:37,540
- Whoa!
- That's fucking hot.

870
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:39,875
Dude, so you're like ransom
or something.

871
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:42,670
Yeah. Stolen boy.

872
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:43,796
Yeah.

873
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,841
- You don't look stolen.
- Yeah.

874
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:50,052
I know. It's weird.

875
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:52,638
Dude, I want you to know that you
can do anything you want, okay?

876
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:53,973
- No, he can't!
- I don't play that shit.

877
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:55,850
You want to fucking leave, go for it.
You want make a call...

878
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:58,018
You shut the fuck up,
you fucking bitch!

879
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:00,104
I'm a fucking bitch?
You're a fucking little bitch!

880
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,773
Guys! Whoa! Fuck!

881
00:57:03,232 --> 00:57:06,068
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Sit down right now, you fucking bitch!

882
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:08,946
- I'm gonna knock your ass out.
- Keith, fucking chill out!

883
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:10,698
God, my brother is...

884
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,200
My brother is gonna
pay the money, okay?

885
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:14,743
See?

886
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:17,329
So, like, in the meantime,
you're, like, on vacation.

887
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:19,874
- Yeah. Exactly. Why not?
- That's fucking awesome.

888
00:57:19,957 --> 00:57:22,251
It's, like, another story
to tell my grandkids.

889
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:23,878
Dude, that is so fucking cool.

890
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:27,715
Dude, this shirt is fucking cool.
Bob Marley is cool.

891
00:57:27,756 --> 00:57:29,675
You guys think
that kidnapping is cool?

892
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:32,344
Yeah, Susan,
it's fucking exciting!

893
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:35,055
I think it's romantic, dude,
he's doing this for his brother.

894
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:37,683
- Are you insane?
- Susan, chill out.

895
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:40,269
Dude, this is fucking wrong!

896
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:43,355
Doesn't anybody else think
that this is fucking wrong?

897
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:47,902
- No!
- Susan, take a fucking Valium! Okay?

898
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:50,488
- It's not even any of your business.
- No! It is my house!

899
00:57:51,697 --> 00:57:54,950
Jesus Christ,
calm the fuck down. All right.

900
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:58,245
I'm going to roll us the biggest
fucking joint anyone has ever seen.

901
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:01,165
- You down with that, Zack?
- Absolutely.

902
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:26,565
Hey. What's up,
you blunted faggot?

903
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:29,068
What's up,
you short bitch?

904
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:32,530
Make yourself busy, baby.
We got to talk some business.

905
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,616
- Can I get you guys a drink?
- Piña Colada?

906
00:58:35,658 --> 00:58:38,244
It's not a bar, baby. There's
no fucking Piña Colada.

907
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:39,411
Not even a little can?

908
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:41,997
No, but I got some wine.
I can make you a spritzer.

909
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:43,249
Okay.

910
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:50,714
Sit down.

911
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:53,342
What's the fucking deal?

912
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:55,302
I don't know what to do.

913
00:58:55,344 --> 00:58:58,430
- What do you mean?
- About the kid.

914
00:58:59,098 --> 00:59:00,933
We could be
in a lot of trouble.

915
00:59:00,975 --> 00:59:02,476
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

916
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,479
Big-ass,
serious-as-shit trouble.

917
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:09,233
I mean, you can't just take a
kid and have no one notice.

918
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:12,236
That's what I told you.
Didn't I say that?

919
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,988
- You did, all right?
- Fuck!

920
00:59:14,071 --> 00:59:18,117
But, still, we are where we are.
Right here, you know?

921
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:22,288
I mean, it's a big problem
and we got to fix it.

922
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:27,126
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

923
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,044
There's an answer here.
There's, like, a solution.

924
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:31,130
But I'm just...
I'm just not seeing it.

925
00:59:32,923 --> 00:59:35,009
I don't know.
Maybe we're fucked.

926
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,928
We're not fucked.

927
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,932
- What do you mean, fucked?
- Jail fucked, motherfucker.

928
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:45,352
If we let the kid go, he runs back to
Mommy and Daddy and he rats us out.

929
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:47,480
- Maybe he won't.
- Not to mention Tattooey.

930
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:49,273
Who knows what that crazy
motherfucker is gonna do?

931
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:51,650
We're all gonna be looking
over our fucking shoulders.

932
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:55,154
I don't think the kid
will spill. I really don't.

933
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:57,072
Yeah, but what if he does?

934
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:03,954
- Fuck that shit.
- You see what I'm saying?

935
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:06,624
I'm not fucking going to prison!
Look, I just won't.

936
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:08,959
Yeah. Me neither, bitch. What the
fuck you think I'm talking about?

937
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:12,379
I'm not fucking kidding, John.
This is really fucking bad.

938
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:15,466
The best thing we could do would
be to get ahold of Tattooey,

939
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:17,343
and to straighten him and all
this shit out once and for all.

940
01:00:17,426 --> 01:00:18,761
Well, where is
that motherfucker?

941
01:00:18,844 --> 01:00:20,763
Who the fuck knows, man?
I don't know.

942
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:23,474
He's probably laying low, looking
to shoot me in the fucking head.

943
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:25,100
I mean, think about it.
That's what I'd be doing.

944
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:28,938
Stop already, all right! You know
how I get with this anxiety shit.

945
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,116
Frankie?

946
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:46,539
- Frankie?
- Yeah.

947
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:50,000
I swear to God, man,
I'm hyperventilating.

948
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:54,463
I want to ask you something.

949
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:57,383
What? Fuck.

950
01:00:57,466 --> 01:00:58,968
Hypothetically, all right?

951
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:02,263
This isn't real, right?
We're just talking here.

952
01:01:02,346 --> 01:01:03,806
But...

953
01:01:05,683 --> 01:01:09,520
What would you say if I were to offer
you $2,500 just to kill the kid?

954
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:13,899
Kill him?

955
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,026
Yeah, fucking wax him.

956
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:22,825
Are you fucking insane?

957
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:26,537
I'm not going to fucking kill the kid.
That's a fucking joke, right?

958
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,999
Of course it's a fucking joke, man!
You're so fucking stupid.

959
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,960
- You're an asshole, man!
- All right, man, I'm just playing.

960
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:34,879
Well, stop fucking around.

961
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:38,632
Look, man, can't we just
grease the kid?

962
01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:42,887
You know tell him he can hang out anytime.
That he's our boy.

963
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,514
Throw a fucking arm around him
or something.

964
01:01:45,556 --> 01:01:48,350
- Give him a few bucks?
- Right.

965
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:50,394
And tell him
when Mommy and Daddy ask,

966
01:01:50,436 --> 01:01:52,980
to say that he ran away
with some girl or something.

967
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,273
- Yeah, maybe, yeah.
- I mean, look...

968
01:01:54,356 --> 01:01:56,817
I mean, we'd have to get the story
straight, but we can make it work, man.

969
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:59,195
- I know we could. We just grease the kid.
- Yeah.

970
01:01:59,236 --> 01:02:00,988
- And then it's taken care of.
- Yeah. Yeah.

971
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:04,992
And that way we're not running around
here like a bunch of fucking Chinamen.

972
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:08,329
Done.

973
01:02:08,412 --> 01:02:10,789
See, that's what I love
about you, man.

974
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:12,708
You're smarter than me.

975
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:42,696
Fuck!

976
01:02:50,746 --> 01:02:53,374
Whoa, whoa.
Let me see that.

977
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:55,709
Come here.

978
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:04,760
- Does it hurt?
- No.

979
01:03:23,362 --> 01:03:25,739
Could I talk to you alone
for a minute?

980
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:36,292
What's up?

981
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:45,342
I just wanted to say
sorry about all this shit.

982
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:48,179
You know, I know that
this is a big pain in the ass.

983
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:51,432
This whole thing
is really fucking ridiculous.

984
01:03:51,515 --> 01:03:54,351
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

985
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:58,147
I mean, is everybody treating you all
right? I mean, you got enough to eat?

986
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,732
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

987
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:03,486
You need anything?
You need some dough?

988
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:04,737
No, I'm good.

989
01:04:04,778 --> 01:04:08,741
- Are you sure? I mean, I...
- No, no, I'm really good. Really.

990
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:10,409
I mean, I know this is hard,

991
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:14,788
but this is all going to get squared
away soon, you know, I promise.

992
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,499
All right, cool.

993
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:21,462
All right.

994
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:24,465
I got to jet, but...

995
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:29,720
You know something?
You know, you're...

996
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:33,057
You're a pretty stand-up guy.

997
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,268
- Thanks.
- I mean, your brother is a dickhead.

998
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,897
I mean, he's my boy and I love
him, but he's just, you know...

999
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,691
I mean, he's acting a motherfucking
fool right now, you know.

1000
01:04:42,775 --> 01:04:46,070
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

1001
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:47,613
Well...

1002
01:04:48,823 --> 01:04:51,283
Anyways, tomorrow.

1003
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:54,787
This will all be over
by tomorrow.

1004
01:05:29,655 --> 01:05:30,656
Hi.

1005
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:34,618
Hey, baby. What's up? I thought
you were spending the night out.

1006
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:36,453
I was. I just...

1007
01:05:37,496 --> 01:05:39,123
I really needed to talk.

1008
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,167
- Talk?
- Yeah.

1009
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:44,587
- What, now?
- Kind of.

1010
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:48,299
One night. I ask for one night
out of the whole fucking year

1011
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,926
to make love to your father and
you won't even give that to me?

1012
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:54,096
I'm X-ing right now. I can't
understand anything you're saying.

1013
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,599
- I'm sorry, Mom, okay?
- Fuck!

1014
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:02,813
He was wearing a brown shirt, a
blue sweatshirt, brown tennis shoes

1015
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:05,566
and his grandfather's ring.
It has a red stone.

1016
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,943
Baby, you got a phone call.

1017
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:09,778
I'll take it upstairs.

1018
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:11,280
Okay.

1019
01:06:11,906 --> 01:06:13,449
Excuse me.

1020
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:25,628
Hello. Hello.

1021
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:29,173
Yo. It's me.
The midget.

1022
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:34,428
You got some set of balls
calling me here.

1023
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:36,639
What's the matter? You don't
answer a motherfucking page?

1024
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:40,518
- We got nothing to talk about.
- Oh, I think we do, don't you?

1025
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:42,478
Straighten out all this
shit once and for all?

1026
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,647
<i>There's nothing to straighten out,
motherfucker. I know it was you.</i>

1027
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,482
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1028
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:49,610
Johnny, I know. I know!

1029
01:06:52,196 --> 01:06:53,572
And you're dead.

1030
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:56,075
<i>- Don't threaten me.
- Fuck that! It's a promise.</i>

1031
01:06:56,158 --> 01:07:00,996
No matter where you go, no matter what
you do, I'm going to hunt you down.

1032
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,667
I'm going to hunt you down, and
then I'm going to slit your throat

1033
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,293
and then I'm going
to cut you open

1034
01:07:06,377 --> 01:07:09,255
and then I'm gonna eat
your motherfucking heart!

1035
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:10,381
You better pray!

1036
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:15,886
Johnny, you better fucking pray
that the cops find you before I do!

1037
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:20,224
Get on your cocksucking knees
and pray!

1038
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:26,021
Hello? Hello?

1039
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:35,322
<i>Mr. Nolder,
Johnny Truelove on two.</i>

1040
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:38,492
Hey, Cock and Balls,
what can I do for you?

1041
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:39,994
Question for you.

1042
01:07:40,035 --> 01:07:43,622
Let's say, someone owes someone
I know money and won't pay.

1043
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:46,167
So that someone I know

1044
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:50,087
has his boys snatch the deadbeat's
kid brother till does he does pay.

1045
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:53,048
<i>- What kind of problems is he looking at?
- Big ones.</i>

1046
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:55,676
<i>If he asks for ransom,
he's looking at life.</i>

1047
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,724
<i>Hello? You there, Cock?</i>

1048
01:08:02,391 --> 01:08:04,727
<i>- Life?
- Life, yeah.</i>

1049
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:11,525
<i>- So what does he do?
- I don't know.</i>

1050
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,947
<i>Probably digs a deep hole. Why?
What's the matter? Who's in trouble?</i>

1051
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,744
What the hell
is he still doing here?

1052
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:23,871
You got to
chill the fuck out, Susan.

1053
01:08:23,954 --> 01:08:25,581
I mean, you keep
running your fucking mouth,

1054
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:28,375
Truelove could go to jail
and we can wind up dead.

1055
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:32,379
Fuck you, all right. You don't know.
That motherfucker's crazy.

1056
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:37,092
Yesterday he offered me
2,500 bucks to kill the kid.

1057
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:41,722
- What?
- Right. Kill him.

1058
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,475
Oh, Jesus.

1059
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:47,812
First you give me mouth and now
you give me fucking tears?

1060
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:51,065
Do me a favor, Susan.
Have a period or something.

1061
01:08:51,106 --> 01:08:56,195
Of course I'm not going to do it! I told
him. I'm just saying, that's how spun he is.

1062
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,906
I got it under control.

1063
01:09:00,574 --> 01:09:03,202
I got it under control,
all right?

1064
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:08,040
Say it. Say, "You, Frankie,
have it under control."

1065
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:09,375
Say it!

1066
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:13,546
- You, Frankie, have it under control.
- Right.

1067
01:09:13,712 --> 01:09:17,800
Now say "I, Susan,
am a whiny fucking bitch

1068
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:20,553
"and you, Frankie,
have it under control."

1069
01:09:23,764 --> 01:09:26,016
I, Susan, am a
whiny fucking bitch

1070
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,352
and you, Frankie,
have it under control.

1071
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:29,562
Right.

1072
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:33,649
Worst comes to worst, I tell
everybody to go fuck themselves

1073
01:09:33,732 --> 01:09:37,361
put 50 bucks in the kid's
pocket, and stick him on a bus.

1074
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:40,239
- You promise?
- I swear.

1075
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,743
See, bitch? Johnny. Hey.

1076
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:46,203
<i>- Hey, what up?
- What's the word?</i>

1077
01:09:46,287 --> 01:09:48,831
<i>- We're picking the kid up.
- Great! What time?</i>

1078
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:50,124
<i>About 8:00, 8:30.</i>

1079
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,169
Listen, man, I'm gonna have to take
him to a hotel or something, then.

1080
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:54,211
<i>What's going on?</i>

1081
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:56,922
My dad's bitch girlfriend is up
my ass with a fucking broom.

1082
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,675
<i>- Call me when you get there.
- All right.</i>

1083
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:01,093
<i>- Okay?
- All right, man.</i>

1084
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:02,887
<i>- I'm on my cell.
- I'll call you when I get straight.</i>

1085
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,221
<i>All right, later.</i>

1086
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:07,683
The kid's going home!

1087
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:26,202
What up, buddies?

1088
01:10:26,285 --> 01:10:29,955
- What up, buddy, buddy?
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!

1089
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:33,626
Hey, we need to borrow
your mom's car.

1090
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:36,879
- Moving?
- Yeah. Moving.

1091
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:46,138
- That one right there.
- Yeah, let's go!

1092
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:49,058
Get off me.

1093
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:52,436
You kids have a good time!

1094
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:56,357
Go!

1095
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,491
- What up?
- Well, when am I gonna fucking get paid?

1096
01:11:05,574 --> 01:11:07,451
Get in there. Get in there.

1097
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:10,162
- You like this shit? This is dope, right?
- Yeah.

1098
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:11,372
Everybody out.

1099
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:14,291
Get the fuck out of here! Can't
you see me on the toilet?

1100
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,627
I don't give a fuck what you're doing.
I said get the fuck out.

1101
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:18,337
I'm trying to pee here!
Let go of me!

1102
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,422
This is my party, and I
say you're getting out.

1103
01:11:20,464 --> 01:11:23,551
- What the fuck are you doing, crazy-ass?
- Hello! Jesus.

1104
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,136
- I can't believe I just saw that.
- I don't give a fuck!

1105
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,514
Listen, to me, Ziggy,
I said, you pay me today.

1106
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:31,934
Oh, you don't have it? Listen,
let me tell you something.

1107
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:35,104
If you see me, you don't
want to fucking see me.

1108
01:11:35,187 --> 01:11:37,022
Yeah, it's like that,
bitch. Fuck you.

1109
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:39,483
- Baby, get off the phone.
- I'm getting off!

1110
01:11:39,525 --> 01:11:42,278
- Is that guy giving you a problem?
- Yeah, why?

1111
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:44,864
Let's kick his ass.

1112
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:48,117
All of a sudden
you're a tough guy?

1113
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,328
I can fight him. I'm a fucking
black belt in tae kwon do.

1114
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:53,038
Shut the fuck up.

1115
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:55,082
- Your ass.
- I am.

1116
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:57,293
Looks like I picked
the wrong man.

1117
01:11:57,543 --> 01:11:59,837
No shit. Come here,
you little fucker.

1118
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:04,466
Come on, bitch. How does that feel?
Think you're bad, huh?

1119
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:06,302
You're going
to break his neck.

1120
01:12:06,385 --> 01:12:07,928
Give the little fucker
a kiss.

1121
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:10,473
Come on, you're fucking
getting it everywhere!

1122
01:12:10,514 --> 01:12:14,185
What are you gonna do now, huh?
Who's your fucking daddy, huh?

1123
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:17,271
- Show me one of your fucking moves.
- What?

1124
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:26,655
Well, hell, no, bitch. Hell fucking no.
You sizing me up?

1125
01:12:28,365 --> 01:12:29,783
You sizing me?

1126
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:37,708
That was fucking awesome!

1127
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,461
- You're fucking awesome!
- Dude.

1128
01:12:41,212 --> 01:12:44,715
That was awesome, dude.
This little bitch can fight!

1129
01:12:44,798 --> 01:12:47,176
- My God, that was amazing.
- Open the door!

1130
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:49,011
Hey, open up, man!

1131
01:12:49,053 --> 01:12:51,055
Fuck off! We're fighting.
There's no room for bitches!

1132
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:53,891
Or fucking queers!

1133
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:56,852
- Come on, open the door, assholes!
- Okay, open it.

1134
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:58,687
Let that sack of
monkey shit in here.

1135
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:00,856
Don't call me a sack
of monkey shit.

1136
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,484
Jesus, what happened
to your shirt, bitch?

1137
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:05,319
I don't know. Dude,
we're out of booze, man.

1138
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:06,487
Already?

1139
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:09,490
Tell your little freeloader friends
to slow the fuck down, Keith.

1140
01:13:09,532 --> 01:13:11,200
I'm not made of money.

1141
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:14,662
- I need a cigarette.
- All right.

1142
01:13:14,703 --> 01:13:17,706
We're leaving. Keep
everything under control.

1143
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:26,841
Hey.

1144
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:36,767
- Is this him?
- Zack, this is Alma.

1145
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:40,771
Watch how fast
I can down this shit.

1146
01:13:56,996 --> 01:14:00,499
Holy motherfucking shit.

1147
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:04,670
Nice.

1148
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:08,090
You should have seen me
with the beer bong.

1149
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:11,093
Quit staring at me.
Your turn.

1150
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:16,056
Okay. Ready?

1151
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:17,975
Go.

1152
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:42,666
- So you're really stolen?
- Yeah. I really am.

1153
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,710
He's cute.

1154
01:14:45,503 --> 01:14:49,215
- You got a girlfriend, stolen boy?
- No.

1155
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:54,136
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

1156
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:58,432
Seventeen? This
motherfucker's 15 years old.

1157
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:02,102
Dude,
what's your fucking problem?

1158
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:06,899
I'm sorry. Jesus.
They don't care anyway, man.

1159
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:11,529
Ever been laid, stolen boy?

1160
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,742
- It's my birthday!
- Happy birthday, girl.

1161
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,369
- Can you guys give us a second?
- Why?

1162
01:15:18,452 --> 01:15:19,912
I need to talk to you
about something in private.

1163
01:15:19,954 --> 01:15:20,955
Hurry.

1164
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,921
Love it.

1165
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:31,799
So?

1166
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:34,134
So what?

1167
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:35,761
What do you think?

1168
01:15:37,096 --> 01:15:39,181
- What do I think?
- Yeah, what do you think?

1169
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,225
What do you mean,
what do I think?

1170
01:15:41,267 --> 01:15:43,269
I mean
about this whole thing.

1171
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:55,865
I think no more music videos.
That's what I think.

1172
01:15:57,241 --> 01:15:58,409
Right.

1173
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:01,912
Fuck it.

1174
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:07,084
You need anything?
Money?

1175
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:08,460
No.

1176
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:12,590
You got gas?

1177
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:15,050
I got gas.

1178
01:16:18,137 --> 01:16:19,472
Okay, then.

1179
01:16:26,937 --> 01:16:28,272
Truelove!

1180
01:16:29,815 --> 01:16:34,403
Are you ready to drink for my birthday?
No, where's he going?

1181
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:39,950
I hate it that
you have to work, Schmitty.

1182
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,661
Happy birthday, Angie.
Eat a piece of cake for me.

1183
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:43,954
Okay.

1184
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:09,897
What are you doing? This is
your lucky night. Get in.

1185
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:49,395
Hi.

1186
01:17:57,987 --> 01:17:58,988
Turn around.

1187
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:01,824
- I don't get it.
- Just turn around.

1188
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:20,718
Start counting.

1189
01:18:21,427 --> 01:18:27,850
One, two, three four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come.

1190
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:31,896
- Marco.
- Polo!

1191
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:32,980
Polo!

1192
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:35,483
- Marco.
- Polo.

1193
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:36,567
Polo.

1194
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:51,809
- Do you want to know what I wished for?
- What?

1195
01:19:51,892 --> 01:19:55,354
- I'll tell you. I want to suck your cock.
- Oh, shit.

1196
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:03,237
Wait, the wish is coming true!
It's coming true! Oh, Lordy!

1197
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,867
Wait, my wish is coming true! My
wish is coming true! Oh, shit!

1198
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:11,412
- Baby, I got to go make a phone call.
- No, you don't.

1199
01:20:11,495 --> 01:20:15,291
- I got to make a phone call for a second.
- No. No. Why?

1200
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:18,085
Bad!

1201
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:19,879
- He's bad.
- Let's open the gifts.

1202
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,046
Yes!

1203
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:33,517
<i>- Hello.
- What up, jerky?</i>

1204
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:36,187
<i>- Yeah, I'm kind of busy.
- Dude, it's me.</i>

1205
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,647
<i>- Johnny?
- Yeah, I'm on my way.</i>

1206
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:42,568
<i>- Oh, great. How long?
- Half an hour. Clear it out, all right?</i>

1207
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:44,820
Yeah, you got it.

1208
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:51,285
Hey, hey, hey,
Zack's going home!

1209
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:53,370
Party's over. All you
motherfuckers got to go.

1210
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:01,837
- Bye, Zack. I'm glad you're going home.
- Bye.

1211
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:04,798
- Thanks.
- Now you got your story to tell.

1212
01:21:04,882 --> 01:21:07,259
- Yeah, bye.
- See you.

1213
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:11,680
- Call me sometime.
- I will.

1214
01:21:11,764 --> 01:21:12,807
You better.

1215
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,225
Bye, stud.

1216
01:21:14,475 --> 01:21:17,228
And wipe that smile off your face.
You're a dead fucking giveaway.

1217
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:18,395
Okay.

1218
01:21:19,855 --> 01:21:20,898
No.

1219
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:23,776
Don't fucking move.

1220
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:27,238
What?

1221
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:30,115
Yo, dude,
just hang out with us.

1222
01:21:30,157 --> 01:21:33,577
- Oh, man, I was going to catch a ride home.
- You love weed.

1223
01:21:33,619 --> 01:21:34,870
- Fuck.
- You love it.

1224
01:21:34,954 --> 01:21:38,582
- Fuck you, ladies.
- We'll see you guys later, all right?

1225
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,377
Drive really fast
with your eyes closed.

1226
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:46,131
You're an asshole.
Roll up, Stratten.

1227
01:21:46,632 --> 01:21:48,759
- Bye, bitches!
- We love you, Zack!

1228
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:51,178
Thanks for
the virginity, baby!

1229
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,859
- Sonny.
- Hey, Elaine, how you doing?

1230
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:06,694
Is my boy here?
I'm looking for him.

1231
01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:08,779
No, they went out
for Angela's birthday.

1232
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:11,323
Something's come up.
You mind if we wait?

1233
01:22:14,535 --> 01:22:16,996
- What are you doing here?
- Outside.

1234
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:26,046
What's the deal, Elvis? You
driving the kid home or what?

1235
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:27,131
- What.
- What?

1236
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:30,509
- That's right.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1237
01:22:32,928 --> 01:22:34,263
What the fuck?

1238
01:22:34,305 --> 01:22:35,514
The kid ain't going home.

1239
01:22:35,598 --> 01:22:38,893
- But I thought Johnny was going...
- Well, you thought wrong.

1240
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:43,355
- Fuck that. Johnny didn't tell me shit.
- The decision's been made.

1241
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:44,482
Fuck you.

1242
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,402
Fuck me? Fuck you!

1243
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:50,696
Johnny sent me here
to take care of something

1244
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:54,116
and I'm gonna fucking do it
with you or through you!

1245
01:22:58,996 --> 01:23:01,499
Who's sucking
whose cock now, huh, Frankie?

1246
01:23:01,582 --> 01:23:04,543
- Fuck that! I'm out.
- Fuck that? You're fucking in.

1247
01:23:04,627 --> 01:23:07,338
I'm up here to clean up your mess,
and you're gonna fucking help me,

1248
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:09,465
or the whole world is gonna
come down on your head.

1249
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:11,884
All right!
Fucking let go of me!

1250
01:23:16,305 --> 01:23:18,557
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

1251
01:23:34,865 --> 01:23:36,534
We need some tape.

1252
01:23:41,664 --> 01:23:43,332
- Fuck that!
- You're gonna dig.

1253
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:44,875
Dig this, bitch!

1254
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:48,963
- You're gonna do it. You're gonna help me.
- Fuck that! No fucking way.

1255
01:23:49,129 --> 01:23:52,133
Ain't no fucking way, Elvis.
I'm not digging.

1256
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:56,011
Fuck you! I did my shit. This
is the line, motherfucker!

1257
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:59,348
Everybody's got one and mine's
a fucking grave, all right?

1258
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:03,769
You want to shoot me? Shoot me right
fucking here. I don't give a fuck!

1259
01:24:13,028 --> 01:24:14,572
Hey, excuse me?

1260
01:24:32,756 --> 01:24:35,301
Where's Frankie?
I need a ride home.

1261
01:24:53,903 --> 01:24:54,904
Whoa.

1262
01:24:56,113 --> 01:24:59,325
- What's going on, man?
- Come on, I need your help.

1263
01:25:01,994 --> 01:25:05,080
What the fuck do you need
duct tape for, dude?

1264
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:11,670
Where is everybody?

1265
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:15,549
Keith said he needed a ride
home, so that guy gave him one.

1266
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:21,388
What are you watching?

1267
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:23,933
<i>- Austin Powers.
- All right.</i>

1268
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:28,854
Shit's so funny.

1269
01:25:30,314 --> 01:25:34,235
This shit's been going on for,
like, I don't know, two minutes.

1270
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:47,456
You wanna run to the store for me?
Get me some cigarettes?

1271
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:50,543
Dude, I'm too young
and they won't sell to me.

1272
01:26:01,387 --> 01:26:04,515
Let's take a drive, let's go somewhere.
You want to?

1273
01:26:04,557 --> 01:26:07,643
No, I'm cool.
I just want to watch a movie.

1274
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,855
Okay.

1275
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:25,828
- Angela.
- What the fuck is going on?

1276
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:27,371
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1277
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:29,039
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

1278
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:30,583
We're going in the other room,
we need to talk.

1279
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,876
Fuck that.
It is my birthday.

1280
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:33,419
- No, we're going right now!
- Don't you fucking touch me!

1281
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:36,172
- Hey, the party's over, wait a second.
- Fuck!

1282
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:38,632
You don't talk to your mother like that.
We're trying to help you!

1283
01:26:38,716 --> 01:26:40,426
- Where's the kid?
- Who?

1284
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,013
- Where's Mazursky?
- I don't know who you're talking...

1285
01:26:44,096 --> 01:26:46,807
Dad, I swear.
Fucking get off me!

1286
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:51,604
You're fucking stupid! Stupid, John!
Don't you fucking get it, you moron?

1287
01:26:51,687 --> 01:26:54,273
There's a Missing Persons
poster on every street corner!

1288
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:55,566
You're in deep shit, Johnny.

1289
01:26:55,608 --> 01:26:57,860
The cops pick you up,
you're doing 25 to life.

1290
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:00,988
- You don't think I know that?
- You've fucked your life up so bad.

1291
01:27:01,071 --> 01:27:04,283
The only way you're going to unfuck
it is that you come clean now, John.

1292
01:27:04,366 --> 01:27:06,869
- You come clean now!
- Calm down, calm down.

1293
01:27:07,745 --> 01:27:11,040
Let me talk to him, all right?
Come on, let me talk to him.

1294
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:14,168
Look, everybody's
getting excited here.

1295
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:17,213
What your father's trying
to say is we have a plan.

1296
01:27:17,296 --> 01:27:19,840
You bring the kid home,
we have a sit-down.

1297
01:27:19,924 --> 01:27:22,259
Me, you, the mother,
the father, everybody.

1298
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:25,054
Sonny brings his checkbook,
and we settle it right there.

1299
01:27:25,095 --> 01:27:27,598
- That will never work.
- I'm not saying it will.

1300
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:29,475
You're probably looking
at some jail time.

1301
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:31,143
But if that's
our only option,

1302
01:27:31,227 --> 01:27:33,896
I'll walk you right through
custody, we'll do it the right way.

1303
01:27:33,938 --> 01:27:36,106
I guarantee you do
minimum sentence.

1304
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,568
Be smart, kid. Let the
spooks do the hard time.

1305
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:41,362
Fuck that. No jail.

1306
01:27:41,695 --> 01:27:45,658
Two years? A piece of cake. Winter,
summer, winter, summer, done.

1307
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:48,702
- No.
- Then you tell us your plan, Einstein.

1308
01:27:49,829 --> 01:27:52,331
You tell us
how this all turns out.

1309
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:57,169
- Hey, Keith, what's up?
- I fell.

1310
01:27:57,253 --> 01:27:58,420
You fell?

1311
01:27:59,839 --> 01:28:02,091
- Hey.
- Don't fucking touch me.

1312
01:28:03,384 --> 01:28:05,928
- What's up?
- What's up, buddy?

1313
01:28:12,268 --> 01:28:14,603
- You're Zack, right?
- Yeah.

1314
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:17,815
Well, I'm Elvis and I'm going
to take you home, man.

1315
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:30,286
You coming?

1316
01:28:31,996 --> 01:28:33,956
You got to do this, man.

1317
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:36,458
It's got to be unanimous.

1318
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:42,256
If the kid goes home,
everybody's looking at life.

1319
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:45,176
- Life?
- Life.

1320
01:28:47,261 --> 01:28:51,765
We talked to a lawyer, man,
and there's no way around it.

1321
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:59,273
Life for what?
For taking care of the kid?

1322
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:02,735
For letting him sleep
at my fucking house?

1323
01:29:02,818 --> 01:29:04,278
You were there
from square one.

1324
01:29:04,361 --> 01:29:08,115
You sat on him the whole fucking time.
You think you're going to walk?

1325
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:11,160
Goddamn. Life?

1326
01:29:12,161 --> 01:29:13,621
There it is.

1327
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:20,044
I mean, I like the kid.

1328
01:29:22,755 --> 01:29:24,507
What's not to like?

1329
01:29:25,466 --> 01:29:26,717
He's 15.

1330
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,679
He's just too much
of a liability.

1331
01:29:32,306 --> 01:29:35,476
Think about it. We send the kid
home, you got Jake looking for you.

1332
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:36,602
You don't want that.

1333
01:29:36,685 --> 01:29:40,648
You don't go along, then Johnny don't
trust you and he's coming after you

1334
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:44,985
and you sure as shit don't want Sonny
Truelove knocking at your door.

1335
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:48,781
We don't have a choice, man.

1336
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:06,924
God, my parents
are going to fucking kill me.

1337
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:09,760
I can just see my mom.
She's fucking...

1338
01:30:09,844 --> 01:30:14,181
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1339
01:30:16,642 --> 01:30:19,562
But, hey, guys, listen,

1340
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:22,481
I would never
rat you guys out.

1341
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:27,486
You guys and me are like... We're
like this. You know that, right?

1342
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:30,030
Frankie, you know that,
right?

1343
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:32,575
Yeah, we know that, man.

1344
01:30:33,325 --> 01:30:34,702
Right. Cool.

1345
01:30:37,705 --> 01:30:40,124
I'm probably
just going to say that I...

1346
01:30:40,207 --> 01:30:43,836
I don't know, that I ran
away or something to, like,

1347
01:30:44,086 --> 01:30:47,339
Bakersfield or Fresno
or something.

1348
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:49,592
Fuck it, you know?

1349
01:30:50,509 --> 01:30:53,429
Hey, does anybody know
where Bakersfield is?

1350
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:58,100
Say you were with a girl.
They'll believe that.

1351
01:31:00,978 --> 01:31:02,646
Yeah, like Julie.

1352
01:31:16,702 --> 01:31:21,999
You know, when I get back, I'm going
to start fresh. You know that?

1353
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:27,171
Like, I just want to start completely
fresh. You ever feel like that, Frankie?

1354
01:31:27,213 --> 01:31:28,714
- What's up?
- Like...

1355
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:32,176
Like, I don't know. Like you want to, I
don't know, go to Europe or something.

1356
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:37,348
Or take a class, or something like that. Or
learn to play an instrument. Like guitar.

1357
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,893
It sounds really fucking hard.
I mean, it's guitar.

1358
01:31:40,976 --> 01:31:45,189
But it bugs me that I don't know
how to do anything, you know.

1359
01:31:45,689 --> 01:31:48,025
I'm pretty sure I could.

1360
01:31:52,488 --> 01:31:53,489
Yeah.

1361
01:31:57,243 --> 01:32:00,246
- Johnny, call it off.
- Nothing's gonna happen.

1362
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:03,541
These guys are such fuck-ups, the
kid's probably loose right now.

1363
01:32:03,582 --> 01:32:05,084
Make the fucking call!

1364
01:32:10,506 --> 01:32:12,216
What are we doing?

1365
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:14,468
We're meeting somebody
who's gonna take you home.

1366
01:32:14,552 --> 01:32:15,845
Oh, cool.

1367
01:32:39,368 --> 01:32:43,080
You know, I think I'm going to
start being nicer to my mom.

1368
01:32:44,415 --> 01:32:49,795
It's kind of gay, but if you
think about it, she's the shit.

1369
01:32:50,045 --> 01:32:53,507
She's, like, my best friend
in the whole world, you know?

1370
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:56,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

1371
01:33:13,444 --> 01:33:17,114
I can't do this. I can't do this, man.
I got to fucking go home.

1372
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:18,616
Come on, Keith.

1373
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,369
Keith?

1374
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:34,840
Dude, what's going on?
You're crying.

1375
01:33:43,224 --> 01:33:44,892
- Get away from me!
- Hey!

1376
01:33:46,477 --> 01:33:47,686
Keith?

1377
01:33:51,106 --> 01:33:52,942
What's the matter
with him?

1378
01:33:53,943 --> 01:33:54,985
Him?

1379
01:34:00,282 --> 01:34:02,201
Frankie, what's going on?

1380
01:34:17,424 --> 01:34:18,425
Frank?

1381
01:34:20,886 --> 01:34:22,138
Frankie?

1382
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:25,558
Dude.

1383
01:34:31,689 --> 01:34:34,650
- Oh, man!
- All right, you ready? Let's do this.

1384
01:34:34,733 --> 01:34:37,194
- Oh, man, please, I didn't do anything.
- Move it. Shut the fuck up.

1385
01:34:37,278 --> 01:34:39,613
- I swear to God, please.
- Relax! Move, move, move.

1386
01:34:39,655 --> 01:34:41,824
- Frankie, please.
- Relax, buddy, relax, okay?

1387
01:34:41,907 --> 01:34:44,326
- It's not what you think, okay?
- Yeah, it is, Frankie!

1388
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,704
- Please, I thought we were boys.
- We are boys.

1389
01:34:46,787 --> 01:34:49,331
Frankie, there's nobody up there!
Nobody is picking me up!

1390
01:34:49,415 --> 01:34:52,918
- Yes, there is, okay. Just stop freaking out.
- Frankie, you promise?

1391
01:34:53,002 --> 01:34:54,128
- I promise, all right?
- Do you swear?

1392
01:34:54,211 --> 01:34:58,340
Zack, everything's cool, on my
life, okay, I swear to God.

1393
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:00,509
- Come on.
- Okay.

1394
01:35:00,593 --> 01:35:02,344
- All right, I swear to God.
- All right.

1395
01:35:02,428 --> 01:35:04,096
- Come on, man.
- All right, man.

1396
01:35:04,138 --> 01:35:06,098
- Let's just walk.
- All right.

1397
01:35:06,182 --> 01:35:08,809
We're just going to take a walk.
Come on, man.

1398
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:16,275
Frankie? Oh, please! I won't tell
anybody, I swear to God, Frankie!

1399
01:35:16,358 --> 01:35:19,320
Hey, we're not gonna do this, right?
We're not really gonna do this.

1400
01:35:19,403 --> 01:35:21,322
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- We're not gonna do this?

1401
01:35:21,405 --> 01:35:23,824
- If you want to live, shut your mouth.
- Please, mister! Please!

1402
01:35:23,908 --> 01:35:25,326
Are you crazy?
This is fucking stupid, man.

1403
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:26,952
Goddamn it, Frankie,
I can't fucking concentrate!

1404
01:35:27,036 --> 01:35:29,330
I swear I won't tell
my mom or anything!

1405
01:35:29,371 --> 01:35:31,874
Shut his fucking mouth
or I'll fucking shoot him!

1406
01:35:31,957 --> 01:35:34,752
- I mean it! I'll fucking shoot him!
- All right! All right!

1407
01:35:34,835 --> 01:35:37,421
You'll never see me again!
I swear!

1408
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:39,715
Look, little man, you got
to calm down, all right?

1409
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:40,841
- Okay?
- Okay.

1410
01:35:40,925 --> 01:35:44,386
- Everybody's nervous, all right?
- I don't want to die, Frankie.

1411
01:35:44,762 --> 01:35:46,430
- Okay?
- Okay.

1412
01:35:47,389 --> 01:35:49,099
- Okay?
- All right.

1413
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:50,976
- Everything's okay.
- Okay.

1414
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,978
- All right?
- Frankie.

1415
01:35:53,938 --> 01:35:56,148
What's the tape for,
Frankie?

1416
01:36:00,027 --> 01:36:03,405
- I would never hurt you, Zacky, all right?
- Okay.

1417
01:36:03,781 --> 01:36:07,493
But I'm going to have to tape you up.
So give me your hands.

1418
01:36:07,868 --> 01:36:11,080
- Okay.
- Everything's going to be all right.

1419
01:36:11,413 --> 01:36:14,959
- Hey. Hey, I'm your boy.
- I know.

1420
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:16,752
- Okay.
- All right?

1421
01:36:17,545 --> 01:36:21,132
See? Everything's okay.
Everything's okay.

1422
01:36:25,928 --> 01:36:29,974
I don't want to die, Frankie.
I don't want to die.

1423
01:36:35,229 --> 01:36:38,274
Now I'm gonna have to
tape your mouth up, okay?

1424
01:36:38,357 --> 01:36:39,692
All right.

1425
01:36:42,027 --> 01:36:43,154
Okay.

1426
01:36:44,196 --> 01:36:46,866
You're my boy.
I wouldn't hurt you.

1427
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:48,993
Okay?

1428
01:36:49,994 --> 01:36:54,540
- Hey, everything's okay.
- All right. I know.

1429
01:36:57,668 --> 01:36:59,837
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1430
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:14,894
What the fuck are you doing?

1431
01:37:34,121 --> 01:37:35,664
Oh, fuck.

1432
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,460
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

1433
01:37:51,931 --> 01:37:53,849
It was 6:00 in the morning

1434
01:37:54,642 --> 01:37:58,896
and several black cars
pulled up.

1435
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:05,903
There were men in suits and the
doorbell was just ringing.

1436
01:38:10,074 --> 01:38:12,409
"We found your son,"
they said.

1437
01:38:16,747 --> 01:38:21,168
"We found your son and it's

1438
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:27,842
"bad news," they said.

1439
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:35,099
About the funeral?

1440
01:38:37,434 --> 01:38:39,562
- Jake didn't show?
- No.

1441
01:38:41,772 --> 01:38:46,777
Oh, he said it was out of respect for me.
That's a crock.

1442
01:38:48,112 --> 01:38:50,239
He just didn't
want to get hit.

1443
01:38:50,322 --> 01:38:53,784
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Shot. Killed. Murdered.

1444
01:38:56,787 --> 01:39:01,750
I happen to know he owes
$50,000 to one drug dealer.

1445
01:39:02,668 --> 01:39:05,504
They have their own rules
in the drug world.

1446
01:39:07,256 --> 01:39:10,092
They killed my son
for $1,200.

1447
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:14,847
I'm just so sorry for your loss.
I mean, I can't even imagine.

1448
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,644
When my son died, I died.

1449
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:29,695
I loved him
every single day of my life

1450
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:33,574
and I wasn't afraid
to show him.

1451
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:39,121
What made you try
and kill yourself?

1452
01:39:40,247 --> 01:39:41,624
I don't know.

1453
01:39:44,877 --> 01:39:49,715
You know, it seemed like a
long time to my natural death.

1454
01:39:52,426 --> 01:39:53,886
I don't know.

1455
01:39:54,512 --> 01:40:00,184
You know, all three times I tried to commit
suicide, there was alcohol involved.

1456
01:40:02,603 --> 01:40:07,274
When I tried to kill myself in
the hospital, I did it wrong.

1457
01:40:08,776 --> 01:40:12,446
You know, you're supposed
to do it like this.

1458
01:40:19,286 --> 01:40:21,205
Maybe it was the pills.

1459
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:26,710
It's all bullshit, anyway.

1460
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:29,630
They say

1461
01:40:32,883 --> 01:40:34,927
there's a reason
for everything.

1462
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:38,931
Well,

1463
01:40:40,933 --> 01:40:44,395
if that God's
got a purpose for me,

1464
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:48,023
he better get the fuck down
here and tell me what it is!

1465
01:40:51,152 --> 01:40:53,028
Because I don't see it.

1466
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:38,365
I think that might be enough
for today. Okay?

1467
01:41:39,158 --> 01:41:41,494
- Thank you for your time.
- Okay.

1468
01:41:44,622 --> 01:41:46,290
- Was that okay?
- Yeah.

1469
01:41:46,332 --> 01:41:47,958
Okay. I'm sorry.

1470
01:42:02,181 --> 01:42:03,682
Yo, what's up?

1471
01:42:07,186 --> 01:42:08,562
Zack's dead.

1472
01:42:10,064 --> 01:42:11,440
How do you know that?

1473
01:42:21,617 --> 01:42:23,327
I had nothing
to do with this.

1474
01:42:24,036 --> 01:42:25,621
I never laid
a finger on him.

1475
01:42:26,831 --> 01:42:28,791
I didn't know
this happened, Susan!

1476
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:31,127
I can't believe it happened.

1477
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:33,671
- Fucking what is going on, Frankie?
- I don't know.

1478
01:42:33,712 --> 01:42:35,256
- Tell me the truth!
- I don't know, okay!

1479
01:42:35,339 --> 01:42:36,674
I think I'm getting set up!

1480
01:42:36,757 --> 01:42:38,008
Did you
fucking take him home?

1481
01:42:38,092 --> 01:42:39,593
Yes! I dropped him off
in Pomona.

1482
01:42:39,677 --> 01:42:42,012
Where? What street? You dropped
him off at his fucking house?

1483
01:42:42,096 --> 01:42:45,349
I don't fucking know, okay?
I dropped him off in Pomona!

1484
01:42:46,433 --> 01:42:49,061
You better get yourself
a good lawyer.

1485
01:42:51,272 --> 01:42:52,523
Fuck you!

1486
01:42:56,193 --> 01:42:59,321
You can't come in here, man. I'm
serious, man. Get the fuck out of here.

1487
01:42:59,363 --> 01:43:02,575
- I'm in trouble, Pick.
- Yeah, no shit. And with my mom's car, man!

1488
01:43:02,658 --> 01:43:04,493
- Why'd you do it, huh?
- I'm sorry.

1489
01:43:04,535 --> 01:43:06,537
Motherfuckers. Do you have any
idea how much fucking shit

1490
01:43:06,579 --> 01:43:08,122
I've been through
for this?

1491
01:43:08,205 --> 01:43:12,042
I'm fucked, Pick. You gotta help me, man.
Can you just give me your car?

1492
01:43:12,126 --> 01:43:13,335
No, man. Fuck that!

1493
01:43:13,419 --> 01:43:14,753
Can you give me
a ride out of town?

1494
01:43:14,837 --> 01:43:16,130
No. Get the fuck
out of here, man!

1495
01:43:16,213 --> 01:43:19,383
- Where the fuck do you want me to go?
- That's your fucking problem.

1496
01:43:19,467 --> 01:43:24,221
Man, you got to let me use your phone.
I gotta call Johnny. Please. Please.

1497
01:43:24,555 --> 01:43:27,600
Look, man, I love you,
but you're on your own.

1498
01:43:43,407 --> 01:43:46,827
Put your hands behind your head, or I'll
blow your fucking head off! Get down!

1499
01:43:46,911 --> 01:43:50,122
I'm not fucking with you, asshole!
Get down on the ground, now!

1500
01:43:50,206 --> 01:43:51,248
Get on your knees,
asshole.

1501
01:43:51,582 --> 01:43:53,584
I can't believe it.
They got Tiko, too?

1502
01:43:53,626 --> 01:43:56,796
Yeah. Tiko, Elvis, Nuts, 911.
They got everybody.

1503
01:43:56,962 --> 01:43:58,506
Well, for what?

1504
01:43:58,798 --> 01:44:02,259
What the fuck do you think, baby?
That kid turned up dead.

1505
01:44:02,343 --> 01:44:04,553
Hey, the Captain
and Tennille.

1506
01:44:04,637 --> 01:44:08,557
- What can I do for you guys?
- Hey, I'd like to trade that for that.

1507
01:44:09,225 --> 01:44:11,477
- You want to trade this car for that car?
- Yeah.

1508
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:15,523
- All right. Let's go get you a loan app.
- We don't need to do that.

1509
01:44:52,393 --> 01:44:54,019
You want to fuck?

1510
01:44:58,566 --> 01:44:59,900
All right.

1511
01:45:42,902 --> 01:45:44,737
- Something wrong?
- No.

1512
01:45:45,362 --> 01:45:47,615
No? Your dick's
not even hard.

1513
01:45:48,324 --> 01:45:50,075
- It's getting there.
- Getting there?

1514
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:52,536
- Yeah, it's getting there.
- It's like a piece of bubble gum.

1515
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,997
Then do something
about it, bitch.

1516
01:46:40,793 --> 01:46:41,794
Sorry.

1517
01:46:41,877 --> 01:46:45,714
Sorry? Yeah, you're a sorry
little bitch who can't even fuck!

1518
01:46:45,923 --> 01:46:48,759
Excuse me for being a little
distracted, all right!

1519
01:46:48,843 --> 01:46:50,594
Give me a break. I've got a
lot on my mind right now.

1520
01:46:50,678 --> 01:46:52,596
Well, what do you want to fucking do?
You want to play cards?

1521
01:46:52,638 --> 01:46:54,431
You want to cuddle?

1522
01:46:55,307 --> 01:46:57,685
- Can't we just...
- No, fuck that shit! I want to fuck!

1523
01:46:57,768 --> 01:47:00,729
- Hey, suck my dick, all right?
- I tried that. It didn't work, did it?

1524
01:47:05,651 --> 01:47:08,195
- You're a fucking bitch.
- Shut the fuck up.

1525
01:47:08,279 --> 01:47:10,865
You know that?
You're a fucking cunt.

1526
01:47:11,323 --> 01:47:13,909
- Where's my fucking shoe?
- I don't know.

1527
01:47:21,834 --> 01:47:24,837
Okay, all right, all right. Fucking truce.
Do you want one of mine?

1528
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,590
Fuck you. I'm taking a walk.

1529
01:48:03,501 --> 01:48:06,837
- Buzz! Johnny's here.
- Johnny who?

1530
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:12,718
<i>Yeah,
it was unbelievable.</i>

1531
01:48:13,302 --> 01:48:15,888
I hadn't seen Johnny
since junior high.

1532
01:48:17,014 --> 01:48:20,643
I mean, what a coincidence, right?
I look up and he's right there.

1533
01:48:20,726 --> 01:48:22,520
Did he tell you
what happened?

1534
01:48:23,854 --> 01:48:26,899
Yeah. He told me
that some friends of his

1535
01:48:27,024 --> 01:48:29,902
had done some bad shit and
that he was going down for it.

1536
01:48:30,152 --> 01:48:34,490
He said that he was in big trouble. He
needed help to get out of the country.

1537
01:48:34,532 --> 01:48:38,035
- And you agreed to drive him, just like that?
- Yeah.

1538
01:48:38,536 --> 01:48:41,956
He's my boy. He was stuck.

1539
01:48:43,374 --> 01:48:45,042
All right. Go on.

1540
01:48:47,419 --> 01:48:48,796
All right.

1541
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:54,677
So we go up by I-25, right? And this
guy is acting fucking weird, dude.

1542
01:48:55,177 --> 01:48:59,056
<i>Talking about God and forgiveness,
all kinds of crazy shit.</i>

1543
01:48:59,557 --> 01:49:03,060
So we get to the border crossing and
he starts flipping out, going crazy.

1544
01:49:03,144 --> 01:49:05,271
I'm like, "Dude,
fucking calm down, bro.

1545
01:49:05,354 --> 01:49:08,482
"We'll stop, we'll pull over, you'll
get in the trunk. It's all good."

1546
01:49:08,566 --> 01:49:12,319
He's like, "No, no, no! They know!
They know! I'm serious! I'm fucked."

1547
01:49:12,403 --> 01:49:16,532
I'm, like... You should have seen it.
He was going out of his mind.

1548
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:20,953
So we turn around, we turn around again.
Now he wants to go to Mexico.

1549
01:49:21,787 --> 01:49:23,831
So we go all the way back down,
we're driving back down.

1550
01:49:23,914 --> 01:49:27,209
We get to Cheyenne.
He changes his mind again.

1551
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:31,672
I'm like, "All right, dude, that's it.
I can't do this forever.

1552
01:49:32,089 --> 01:49:34,425
"Where the fuck
do you want to go?"

1553
01:49:58,073 --> 01:50:00,493
- Be right back.
- Okay.

1554
01:50:04,955 --> 01:50:08,250
Hey, I mean it,
all right. Five minutes.

1555
01:50:08,918 --> 01:50:11,128
All right.
I'll wait for you.

1556
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:20,573
It's been four years
since your son's escape,

1557
01:51:20,656 --> 01:51:21,657
and you know what?

1558
01:51:21,782 --> 01:51:25,661
I think you helped him. I think
you know exactly where he is.

1559
01:51:26,162 --> 01:51:29,123
There it is. Million
dollar question, right?

1560
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:33,002
What you, the cops, the D.A., the Feds,
what everybody wants to know, right?

1561
01:51:33,085 --> 01:51:35,421
Somebody had to help him
get out of the country.

1562
01:51:35,463 --> 01:51:36,881
Somebody has to be
sending him money.

1563
01:51:36,964 --> 01:51:39,216
I do not know
where my son is.

1564
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:42,511
And if I knew, you think I'd tell
you and this fucking camera?

1565
01:51:42,595 --> 01:51:44,305
I think he's lost.

1566
01:51:45,097 --> 01:51:46,223
What?

1567
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:51,312
The day they dropped him off at my house, I
reached into the fridge to get a sandwich,

1568
01:51:51,395 --> 01:51:53,189
I turned around,
he was gone.

1569
01:51:53,272 --> 01:51:56,358
- Come on.
- I'm telling you, he's lost.

1570
01:51:56,734 --> 01:52:00,196
I think he's right.
I mean, I ain't seen him.

1571
01:52:01,238 --> 01:52:02,740
He ain't here.

1572
01:52:03,407 --> 01:52:05,075
He must be lost.

1573
01:52:06,702 --> 01:52:09,121
Now get the fuck
out of my house.
