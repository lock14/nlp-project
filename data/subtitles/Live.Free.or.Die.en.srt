1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,804
Let's go, cop killers.

2
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,605
Give you 30 seconds to give yourselves up.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,044
Come out slowly with your hands in the air

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,912
like you're playing a nice little game of volleyball.

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,689
This here is John "Rugged" Rudgate, the gangster.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,529
The badass who outfoxed the cops

7
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,037
and hightailed it out of town and into the history books.

8
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,240
Hey... you guys want to buy some speakers?

9
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,722
Rugged was supposedly behind

10
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,800
every unsolved crime in New Hampshire

11
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,527
in the last 10 years...

12
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,536
from breaking into the peewee league storage shed

13
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,096
to murdering that fat fuck lumberjack, Rod Connelly.

14
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,878
Not too many places get their own legendary criminal.

15
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:01,215
Chicago had Al Capone with his huge fucking empire
of whorehouses and speakeasies.

16
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:08,924
New Mexico had Billy The Kid, who stole so many horses
they had to invent the car just to fucking get around.

17
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,796
And New Hampshire had Rugged.

18
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,909
The amazing thing was, I was gonna get to work with him.

19
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,780
I was gonna nab a stack of diplomas
from the Andover tractor-trailer trucking school

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,944
and he was gonna turn them into big coin.

21
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:39,548
Was I nervous? Fuck, yeah. But who wouldn't be?

22
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,924
- What's up, Marcus?
- What's up, Rugged?

23
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,429
Relax, man. You look conspicuous.

24
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,658
How'd we do?

25
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,495
Well...

26
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,398
Got five.

27
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,528
Five O.K.?

28
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,199
Yeah. Shit hot, man.

29
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,840
That's real fucking good.

30
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,777
Well? What do you think we're gonna get for them?

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,906
You don't worry about that. That's my deal. O.K.?

32
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,544
But considering trucking school charges
four grand for one of these jobbies,

33
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,919
I'm thinking we'll start north of a thousand.

34
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,184
Well north.

35
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,759
- Apiece?
- Mmm.

36
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,624
I'm not saying I'm gonna get that.

37
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,096
My rock bottom floor is 500. At 500, I walk.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,260
And by the way, you back me up
no matter what I do, O.K.?

39
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,633
If I walk out that door, you are on my heels.

40
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,603
If I get angry, you act fierce.

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,198
If I decide to jump up on this table and start screaming,

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,801
you act like I do that all the fucking time. Get it?

43
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,937
Yeah. Sure, Rugged.

44
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,177
They're here.

45
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,550
It's the guy from the Clam Shack. Parka boy.

46
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,384
Still shucking oysters, parka boy?

47
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,118
Yeah, right.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,165
Show 'em the goods, Marcus.

49
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,238
Well, it's, uh... 60 bucks apiece, man.

50
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,642
That's not bad for a morning's work, hmm?

51
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,774
Not bad? I was at that
fucking tractor-trailer school all week.

52
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,819
You only grabbed five, man.
You got to get more next time.

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,186
There's not gonna be a next time.

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,816
Ah, don't quit on me, man.

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,259
You didn't even fucking negotiate.

56
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,523
What?

57
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,929
You were scared of those guys.

58
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,330
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,800
I was looking at you. You're a coward.

60
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,030
Hey, watch it.

61
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,869
What are you gonna do, whack me?
Like you whacked Connelly?

62
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:40,036
What... what a lie. You're a fucking liar.

63
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:44,276
O.K., fine.
You want to walk away from a good thing here, Marcus?

64
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,351
Let me tell you something,

65
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,818
you're not gonna make this kind of money
working at the Clam Shack, all right?

66
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,253
This is tax-free.

67
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:56,090
O.K., so Rugged wasn't quite the badass yet.

68
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,028
So now you're wondering,
how does a small-time coward

69
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,863
turn into some kind of Granite State Billy The Kid?

70
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,564
Well, that's what this story's all about.

71
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,300
It's a tough economy, Marcus.

72
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,049
Fuck.

73
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,739
Whoa...!

74
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,382
Goddamn it, man.

75
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,960
Motherfucker.

76
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,047
Hey.

77
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,219
Hey.

78
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,022
Rugged.

79
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,363
- Lagrand?
- What's up?

80
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,095
Nothing, man, you know.

81
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,398
What are you doing around here, man?

82
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,804
I, uh, I thought you left the state.

83
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,969
- My old man died.
- Ah. No shit.

84
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,482
- Well, I guess he was fat enough.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,075
So how long you in town for?

86
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,246
I don't know.

87
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm running the U-Lock. I inherited it.

88
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,661
No shit. Really?

89
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:18,328
Yeah, I'm running it. It's mine, so...

90
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,566
Shit hot, man. It's a great fucking gig.

91
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,142
Yeah, it is.

92
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,471
My mom, she rents over there.

93
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,138
It's, uh, 126.

94
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,048
Yeah, I know.

95
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,882
Lagrand, running the U-Lock.

96
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,548
That's fucking great, man.
You're, uh, you're set.

97
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,718
You should be buying the good stuff.

98
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,194
Yeah.

99
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,391
If you want. I, I don't care.

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,492
- I kind of like Gordon's.
- Yeah, stick with Gordon's.

101
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,635
You know what I've been up to.

102
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,573
- You heard about me?
- No.

103
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,942
Let me get a Wizard Of Odds
and two Dough-In-A-Rows.

104
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,344
Yeah, man, I've been into some heavy shit.

105
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,915
Heavy shit.

106
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,779
I'm doing very well for myself.

107
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,580
You and I should talk.

108
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,316
- Yeah. Cool.
- All right.

109
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,757
So I'll stop by next time I'm at my mom's locker.

110
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,729
- Sounds good.
- All right.

111
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,234
- See you around.
- See you around.

112
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,935
Can you get another bottle?
This one's missing the code.

113
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,974
One hand under the box, Kelly. Both hands.

114
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,638
And fragile, careful.

115
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,183
Uh, brake fluid, two-for-one.

116
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,390
$14.34.

117
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,520
What are you doing?

118
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,621
It's a rebate check.

119
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,868
It's, uh... it's good till the 16th.

120
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,371
Out of 15.

121
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,079
Move it to the road, John.

122
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,917
Yeah, I got, uh, brake problems, Larry.

123
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,547
I'll just be a sec.

124
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,822
You know where this stuff goes?

125
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,420
Is it the master cylinder?

126
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,229
Uh... I don't know. Could be.

127
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,396
Haven't gotten your rent check yet.

128
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,839
Yeah, I'm gonna make it out right after this.

129
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,467
It's, uh, it's the e-brake. It's dead.

130
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,046
- It keeps hitting the floor.
- That's a cable.

131
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,911
- What's a cable?
- The parking brake. It's a cable.

132
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,451
It tightens the shoe against the drum.

133
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,323
- Can I keep it here?
- Leave a key in it.

134
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,531
Don't use the water.

135
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,798
Why not?

136
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,807
The septic tank's leeching into the well.

137
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,969
- You're shitting me.
- No.

138
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,846
It should clear up soon... as long as it doesn't rain.

139
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,835
Ahh! Oh, God!

140
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,086
Mr. Rudgate, Logan from Black and Decker.

141
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:34,490
O.K., I think I was able to get you the $85 rebate check
for the professional grade skill saw.

142
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,061
Uh, the only thing is,
my boss will need that receipt.

143
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,461
- All right.
- So when your uncle gets back from Greece...

144
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,657
Yeah.

145
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,860
...please send it to us... thank you.

146
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,461
Who da boss? Who da boss?!

147
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,667
Who da boss? You da boss?

148
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,141
Who da boss, man?

149
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,906
You da boss.

150
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,853
Sped!

151
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,086
Hey, Sped.

152
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,459
Hey, Sped.

153
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,432
Special Ed? Remember that?

154
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,972
- That was a mistake.
- I know you're not retarded.

155
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,234
I spent a year with those moos.

156
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,335
- Keep up with any of them?
- Fuck no.

157
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,311
I'm kidding, man. Relax.

158
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,906
So, you want to knock off and get a burrito?

159
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,007
Yeah.

160
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,738
Is McMann still around?

161
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,935
McMann? No, he joined the coast guard

162
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,171
or the merchant marine or something.

163
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,747
Whatever the fuck they do.

164
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,276
I didn't even know you knew him.

165
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:46,086
Yeah. He was the guy that had me eat
that flaming stuff thing.

166
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,687
The sterno. At the China Tiki.
You ate the buffet.

167
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,894
You ate the sterno. When was that?

168
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,460
I don't know. It was a while ago.

169
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,168
We were working at the Clam Shack, right?

170
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:09,373
Clam Shack. What a joke, man. Fucking Clam Shack.

171
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,177
I almost completely forgot about that place.

172
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,718
You don't work there anymore?

173
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,757
Fuck no. What, are you kidding me?

174
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,762
Remember when Omar
threw those crab legs at you?

175
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:30,325
Yeah. Well, Omar wouldn't throw
crab legs at me anymore.

176
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,769
Because you don't work there anymore.

177
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,741
That's the least of it. That's the fucking least of it.

178
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,108
- You haven't heard about me, Lagrand.
- No.

179
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,081
No. You probably don't even know about Connelly.

180
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,618
What's Connelly?

181
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,713
Rod Connelly. Fuckface logger?

182
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:56,659
Happened to get his head decapitated from his body,
mysteriously.

183
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,993
- Oh, yeah, I did hear about that.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,559
Let's just say that's one logger
that won't be giving me shit anytime soon.

185
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,331
Nope.

186
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,872
Get what I'm saying here?

187
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,139
- You understand what I'm saying, Lagrand?
- Yeah.

188
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,219
What, you did it?

189
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,689
You didn't hear it from me.

190
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,329
Lagrand, when you left here,
I was some scared little kid.

191
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:41,668
Riding to work on a moped,
getting seafood tossed at me.

192
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,503
By Omar.

193
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,635
Getting pushed around.

194
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,872
But I've made my bones now, man.

195
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,109
I get women. I buy what I want.

196
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:56,551
Most importantly, nobody in this town fucks with me.

197
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,714
Damn.

198
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,987
That's not going anywhere.
That's a Windsor knot.

199
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,789
All right.

200
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,161
Your buddies need speakers,
you tell 'em come talk to me.

201
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,068
This... this label's got your name on it.

202
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,775
Oh, yeah. Pick... pick that off, will you?

203
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,011
- I thought you said they were stolen.
- Yeah, yeah.

204
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,283
I make like they're stolen
so people think they're getting a deal.

205
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,848
Cracks me up. It's a complete scam.

206
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,554
- That's a good scam.
- Yeah.

207
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,427
I mean, not that I have a problem
with stealing, you know.

208
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,126
Not that I have a problem with that at all.

209
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,329
You know, I don't like unnecessary risks.

210
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,541
Chief?

211
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,508
I have a kid out here
who says he bought some stolen speakers.

212
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,307
- Can I give him to you?
- Why?

213
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,712
The, um, "check oil" light came up on the cruiser.

214
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,943
I wanted to take it to the Texaco.

215
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,850
Well, it can wait. Bring him in, Putney.

216
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,894
This is, um, Todd Thompkins.

217
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,295
Todd Thompkins.

218
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,769
- You Ted Thompkins' boy?
- No.

219
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,740
Well, it's a common name.
So, uh, tell us about the seller, Todd.

220
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:28,973
They were these two guys.
They were pretty old.

221
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,107
I don't know, definitely out of high school.

222
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,584
One of them didn't say much,
he was just, like, a big goon.

223
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:41,216
The other one was around my height. Tan jacket.

224
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,592
- You said he drove a tan van?
- A blue van.

225
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,895
- Was it a minivan or a big van?
- What do you mean?

226
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:58,034
Well... a Dodge Caravan is kind of big,
but it's considered a mini-van.

227
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,611
Well, I, I've ridden in those-- this was a van.

228
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,077
Um, I'm sorry, Chief.

229
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,947
I really... I want to take care of this before they close.

230
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,315
Fine, Putney.

231
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,183
Did you get a license plate, Todd?

232
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,555
Let's talk about you.

233
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:24,864
Running the U-Lock. Not too shabby.

234
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,461
That thing's a cash cow.

235
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,905
Why?

236
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,569
I mean, it makes... makes pretty good money, right?

237
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,080
Oh, yeah. Tons.

238
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,016
Course, uh... man, that is a tough business to run.

239
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,350
Especially all by yourself. I mean...

240
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:52,261
My sister helps out.
Sometimes. With little stuff. Only.

241
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,991
Yeah, but, I mean, you know,

242
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,829
it's not exactly the opera crowd you got
hanging out over there, man.

243
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:01,634
I mean, you got people hiding shit,
storing shit, stealing shit, you know?

244
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,935
I mean, I just, I hope...

245
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,011
I hope you got somebody good
handling security, that's all.

246
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,546
Yeah, I hope so.

247
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,344
Well, who you got?

248
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:17,479
- Um, I don't think my dad had anybody.
- Your dad?

249
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,992
- Your dad was a tough guy.
- My dad <i>was</i> a tough guy.

250
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,557
Your dad was a motherfucker.

251
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,898
Your dad was a fucking marine, man.
He had a reputation, like me.

252
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,304
Maybe not as strong as mine, but...
Your dad kept his distance, man.

253
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,035
Me, I like to get in close, man.

254
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,941
I like to feel it, get my fucking hands dirty, you know?

255
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,411
I'll shank a motherfucker, man.

256
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,314
And then I'll go to bed that night
and I'll sleep like a fucking baby.

257
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,479
Man, I wish I could help you out, man,
but I don't have buttloads of time.

258
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,149
Yeah.

259
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,987
Ah, fuck it. You know what, man?

260
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,585
You're a fucking friend. I'll make time. Let's do this thing.

261
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,928
- O.K.! Cool.
- So you want to do it?

262
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,403
- Yeah!
- All right. All fucking right, man.

263
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,133
All right, so how do you want to work this thing out?

264
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,401
What do you mean?

265
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,104
Well, you want to do like a,
like an equity thing or a, a fee?

266
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,306
Like some kind of combination of the two? What?

267
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,818
I don't know.

268
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,149
You were just all fucking psyched up about it.

269
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,917
Yeah, I just didn't know it was like an official <i>thing</i>.

270
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,549
Lagrand, I'm doing you a favor here, man.

271
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,754
- Yeah... but I just need to think about it.
- What's there to think about?

272
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,525
You know, like business things.

273
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,760
Lagrand, this is a great fucking deal for you, man.

274
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,426
Do you know who I am? You understand?

275
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,337
I'm a stone fucking killer, man.
I kill people with my bare fucking hands.

276
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,932
You have a murderer working for you,
don't you get that?

277
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,944
Yeah... yes, and I know how cool that would be.

278
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,573
Listen, I just got to figure stuff out.

279
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,311
Figure... All right, fine, man, you figure it out.

280
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,047
You figure it out, man, you know what,
'cause I got stuff to figure out, too.

281
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,089
I got a lot of shit to figure out, you know.
'Cause this deal,

282
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,719
this deal could be a real pain in the ass for me, man.
A real pain in the ass.

283
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,501
Cheryl.

284
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,471
Hey, did Dad prepay the funeral expenses?

285
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,439
I don't know. Cheryl.

286
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,308
I think the mortician's double-billing us.

287
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,540
- Um, so you remember...
- So, how'd it go with the doors?

288
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,638
- Fine.
- Really?

289
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,650
- Listen, Cheryl...
- Did you finish them?

290
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:30,381
- Not yet.
- We get major complaints when the doors stick, Jeff.

291
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,547
I'm sorry. Listen, Cheryl...

292
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,023
I feel like I'm doing everything around here.

293
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,286
I'm doing stuff.

294
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,362
Well, what are you doing?
There's nothing else to do.

295
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,327
There's this and there's that.
Finish the doors, please.

296
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,264
I hate talking to these people
any more than I have to.

297
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,835
O.K. Um, so, you remember Rugged.

298
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,927
I used to work with him at the Clam Shack.

299
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,802
- No.
- John Rudgate.

300
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,534
- No.
-- Rugged Rudgate.

301
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,475
No! I don't remember him.

302
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,409
We have a Rudgate-- Doreen Rudgate.

303
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,678
- That's his mom.
- O.K. What?

304
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,722
Well, he's a... I was talking to him and
he said that maybe he could help us out and...

305
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,792
- Help us out with what?
- Um, security.

306
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:12,887
- Security? What's his rate?
- I don't know.

307
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,863
Equity.

308
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,925
- He's not getting equity.
- Why not?

309
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,598
- Equity is ownership.
- It is?

310
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:27,008
Yeah. Security's nothing.
It's, like, 50 bucks a month.

311
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,742
Well, I just thought, he's somebody we want to work with
and I don't see what the big deal is.

312
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,785
Why don't you see if he can do it for 50 a month?

313
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,717
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

314
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:41,156
50 a month. All right. Cool. I'm sure he can.

315
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,788
- He's a really cool guy.
- Great.

316
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,080
- What's up, man?
- Lagrand. Partner.

317
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,119
Have a seat, man. Step into my office.

318
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,122
- Office.
- Been here before?

319
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,524
- Yeah. All the time.
- M.G.D. On me.

320
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,392
- Thanks, sweet pea.
- Fuck off.

321
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,330
Never try a ménage-à-trois, my friend.

322
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,836
They say they're cool with it,
then they freak out. Yeah.

323
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,339
So, listen, man, I'm fucking pumped
about this U-Lock thing.

324
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,639
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah? It's gonna be fucking great, man. Cheers.

325
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,120
So, listen, man, when we talk terms...

326
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,745
I want you to know,
I'm gonna be a hardnose motherfucker, O.K.,

327
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,790
because that's just the way I do business.

328
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,655
I don't think you'd expect anything less of me.

329
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,820
But, but the way I negotiate has nothing to do
with how happy I am

330
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,160
we're gonna be working together, O.K.?

331
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,632
Working together again, right?

332
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,568
What, what do you mean?

333
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,639
Clam shack.

334
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,143
Fucking Clam Shack.
That place was a joke, man.

335
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,907
What did they pay us there, like 50 bucks a week?
Chump change.

336
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,507
No, no, no, this is something, man.
This is a fucking enterprise.

337
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,949
I mean, something to hold on to.

338
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,816
Give me some figures, man.
What are you thinking?

339
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,890
Throw out some numbers.
Give me something to chew on.

340
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,894
Parka boy. You even feel that?

341
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,090
- Fuck off, Oldfield.
- What?

342
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:39,433
Don't worry about those guys. I know them,
they're just screwing around. Playing.

343
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,012
What were you, uh... what were you saying?

344
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:47,176
Listen, Rugged.
I don't know if this is gonna work out.

345
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,187
Because of that?
That, that's fucking, that's bullshit, man.

346
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,950
You don't think I'm gonna respond to that?

347
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,958
- I'm gonna respond to that shit.
- It's not that.

348
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,359
I'm holding back. Those fucking guys
are walking dead men, O.K.?

349
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,397
They're fucking dead.
I can't do anything right now.

350
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,591
- My buddy owns the bar.
- It's just...

351
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,399
it's that I don't think
I have that much money right now.

352
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,234
That's fucking... that's bullshit, man.

353
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,137
That's fucking bullshit, that's what that is.

354
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,938
What do you need to see, huh?
You need to see me get real?

355
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,138
You want to see me get real with these guys, huh?

356
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,663
You guys are dead, man. Fucking dead.

357
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,864
Yeah, laugh. Laugh like Connelly did.

358
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,533
Oh, yeah. You killed Connelly.
We're shaking, parka boy.

359
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,771
Ooh...

360
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,518
Show some fucking action, man.
Fucking man of action.

361
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,921
Man of action. Man of fucking action.

362
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,357
- Lagrand!
- Huh?

363
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,488
Listen, Rugged, I'm sorry about...

364
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,065
No, man, you listen.
There's something you need to know.

365
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,657
- I really want to work with you.
- I don't care.

366
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,499
I don't care about that, man, O.K.?
You need to know something.

367
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,201
Those motherfuckers in there tonight,
they fucking walked into a bear trap, O.K.?

368
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,304
They don't know it yet, but they did.

369
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,748
And I think you could really learn something
by watching how this shit goes down.

370
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,319
- Uh-huh.
- I'm serious.

371
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,445
Yeah.

372
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,750
- You free tomorrow night?
- Yes.

373
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,324
You prepared to see some serious shit?

374
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,224
'Cause you're gonna see a side of me
you ain't seen before, man.

375
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,318
Yes.

376
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,127
O.K. I'll pick you up at the U-Lock at 5:00.

377
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,224
Bring cigs. Go. Go.

378
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,112
Fuck! Damn it!

379
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,522
What happened with the oil light yesterday?

380
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,530
Tweedledee at the Texaco said you didn't come by.

381
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,293
The oil light? Oh, it, um...

382
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,095
It, uh, fixed itself.

383
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,262
Wow, that's some luck.

384
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,364
Mrs. Connelly. I thought we sent them flowers.

385
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,444
Today, today would have been his birthday, so...

386
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,638
Uh-huh.

387
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,977
Say, uh, what happened with the speakers?

388
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,917
Well, interestingly enough, the D.M.V. says
there's only four blue vans registered in town,

389
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,286
and one of them is registered
to a Mr. John Rudgate-- ring a bell?

390
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,653
"Fart," right?

391
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,855
He's the juvenile
who painted the obscenity on the patriot tree.

392
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,555
But there were two in the van.

393
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,634
The goon? Yeah, well, he'll show up.

394
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,169
They always do.

395
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,794
This come out of petty cash?

396
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,965
No, I, uh... I bought it myself.

397
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,406
Uh-huh.

398
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,637
It's very nice.

399
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,284
What are you doing?

400
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,853
Waiting for Rugged.

401
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,254
If he's doing security,
I'm gonna need his social or his tax I.D.

402
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,953
- I told you that.
- I'm working that out.

403
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,189
Cheryl, do I have equity?

404
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,323
Yeah, we both do.

405
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,926
If I wanted to, could I give my equity to Rugged?

406
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,201
Uh, no. That would make it impossible
for us to sell this place.

407
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,366
Why?

408
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,639
'Cause then buyers
are gonna have to deal with you and me

409
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:46,149
and some ridiculously overcompensated
clam shucker security guy.

410
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,517
If we sell this place, do I still get to work here?

411
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,613
No. That's the idea.

412
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,851
Well, I don't think that's a good idea.

413
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,621
Well, Jeff, you know,
you can do whatever you want with your share.

414
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,789
You can buy another U-Lock, half-size.

415
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,697
No... I like it here.

416
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,828
This is the best job I've ever had.

417
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,838
Of course it is. You don't do anything.

418
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,009
Well, I'm doing something tonight--

419
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,514
I can tell you that much.

420
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,823
I feel bad about this whole...

421
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,061
I got a certain way of doing things,
Lagrand, you know?

422
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,570
Some fucker messes with me, man,
I don't necessarily fight him right there.

423
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,642
I bide my time. I cogitate.

424
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,767
Or ruminate, whatever the fuck it's called.

425
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,779
Grab that brown bag back there.

426
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,380
That fat fuck Oldfield is gonna get his tonight.

427
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,320
You and me are going down
to that little shit-box house of his near the gravel pit,

428
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,891
we're gonna wait till he leaves,

429
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:05,827
and we are gonna give him
something I like to call a welljob.

430
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,761
You know what that is?

431
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,201
You gotta speak up, Lagrand.

432
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,462
I'm going out of my way to educate you here, man.

433
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,004
If you don't understand something,
you ask me a question.

434
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,666
I'm happy to answer.
I'm happy when you ask questions.

435
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,642
For God sakes,
don't just sit there like a fucking moo.

436
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,646
- I'm not a moo.
- I'm just saying.

437
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,012
O.K., what's a well chop?

438
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:30,952
A well<i>job</i> is when you fuck
with somebody's water well, man.

439
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,283
It could be anything:

440
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,291
a leaky septic system, poison, whatever.

441
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,851
Me, personally, I like to use...

442
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,659
brake fluid.

443
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,597
Will this kill him?

444
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,430
Nah.

445
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,027
Well, it might kill him.

446
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,538
You cool with that?

447
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,233
Yeah, I guess so.

448
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,310
You better be goddamn sure, Lagrand.

449
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,710
This is serious shit. This is big time.

450
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,384
Did you even pack these, man?
This is like smoking air.

451
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,453
You got to pack 'em.

452
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,629
Car 2-9-0.

453
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:16,029
Lieutenant O'Shea has asked me to relay
that he would like no mayonnaise on his sandwich.

454
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:21,367
No mayonnaise for lieutenant Billy O'Shea.

455
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,655
What are you doing, Putney?

456
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,389
Uh... just, um, taking a little break.

457
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,829
Staking out your own house?

458
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,093
Stacy send you packing?

459
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,398
No... it's... It's Susan.

460
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,669
Oh. Well, whatever her name is,
she's a terrific lady.

461
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,211
Listen, buddy...

462
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,943
I think that Connelly case
has got you a little bogged down, am I right?

463
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,918
But you can't get hung up on one case.

464
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,886
I mean, you're a good cop, Putney.

465
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,391
You got to learn that every case counts.

466
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,860
I mean, my first case was just some indigent old woman

467
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:22,421
who was stealing pennies from the
"leave a penny, keep a penny" dish,

468
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,525
but in some ways it was my most gratifying.

469
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,730
Hell of an interrogation...
but she broke.

470
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,239
They all do.

471
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,315
What if he doesn't go out?

472
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,849
It's Friday night, man.

473
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,351
Everybody goes out.

474
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,161
You got to jiggle it.

475
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,076
Hey, that's the guy from the bar.

476
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,145
Get down! Get down!

477
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,340
- Your hands are sweaty.
- Shut up!

478
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,466
All right, he's gone.

479
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,236
You want to do this?

480
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,014
This is the real shit, Lagrand--
I need a real fucking answer from you.

481
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,913
Yeah, definitely, so...

482
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,515
Good.

483
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,778
Fuck!

484
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,696
Thank God I had a big lunch.

485
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,325
Mmm...

486
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,630
Eat the chicken strips.

487
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,366
I'm not eating anything in this shithole.

488
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,637
Clams? You know, my grandfather
used to sell those shits to summer people

489
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,474
and laugh his fucking ass off-- you know why?

490
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,842
This smell funny to you?

491
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,542
Because they're fucking bottom-feeders, that's why.

492
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,381
They eat their own shit.

493
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,820
I need, like, tartar sauce or something.

494
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,619
I need, like, a big thing of it.

495
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,855
Great... shit and mayo, that's appetizing.

496
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,035
These little necks?

497
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,036
- Where'd you get those?
- The bucket.

498
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,333
That's the fucking garbage.

499
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,933
They're going out.

500
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,138
Nobody told me.

501
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,340
How can you not fucking smell that?

502
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,350
I been serving them.

503
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,780
Jesus...

504
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,655
Keep it under your fucking hat.

505
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,965
Fucking-A, man!

506
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,099
We fucking did it!

507
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,301
We did it.

508
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,002
Fucking right we did, man.

509
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,172
Whoo...!

510
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,513
Now, I want you to take what I taught you tonight,

511
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,179
I want you to apply it to this place, man.

512
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,587
'Cause I am all the fuck over this place, man!

513
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,658
I'm gonna hit this place...

514
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,954
...right fucking back!

515
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,326
Rugged, listen, I mean, what we did...

516
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,797
Fucking don't... don't fucking think
about it tonight, man.

517
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,698
You're crazy, you're out of your mind, you're...
coursing with adrenaline, man.

518
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,567
You probably don't know half the ramifications
of what we did tonight.

519
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,903
- I know.
- Just... don't fucking think about it.

520
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,909
Just, sleep... sleep on it.

521
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,535
Think about it.

522
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,546
All right.

523
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,082
Sleep and think, man.

524
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,189
Fucking clams were bad.

525
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,291
I can't feel my tongue.

526
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,760
Don't give me that shit.

527
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:19,887
What shit?

528
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,227
You're fucking licking me tonight, you got that?

529
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,461
Donna, I'm a mess.

530
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,628
I am out of here. I'm getting a cab.

531
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,571
- No, baby, I'm sick.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

532
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:35,112
Baby. Ba...

533
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,949
You have reached Hanson Automotive.

534
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,211
Our normal business hours

535
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,686
are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., pacific time.

536
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,518
If you know your party's extension...

537
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,591
Fuck no...

538
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,858
Hello?

539
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,453
- Hello? Hello!
- Yeah?

540
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,964
Yes?

541
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,057
Yeah, hi, um... I, I,

542
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,228
I'm calling about your,
uh, your C15 heat-resistant brake fluid.

543
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,738
I need to speak to somebody.
It's an emergency.

544
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,138
Everyone's gone, man.

545
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,402
Yeah, I know that, but I...

546
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,535
I poured your brake fluid into my,

547
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,580
uh, in my water w... fountain,

548
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,741
uh, and I think...

549
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,012
I think I'm in trouble.

550
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,020
Why'd you do that?

551
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,647
It was an accident,
but the important thing is that I...

552
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,919
My dog may have drank some of that shit.

553
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,688
- How bad is that gonna fuck him up?
- That's bad shit, man.

554
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,560
Sometimes when we make it outside,
the birds, they die.

555
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,155
Holy fuck.

556
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,929
O.K., um...

557
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,368
Is there any way to, uh...

558
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,303
I'd stick to the bottled stuff for now.

559
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,603
Yeah, is there any way to neutralize it?

560
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,905
Hope you got a lot of vinegar.

561
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,377
Vinegar? O.K., good.

562
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,345
How much? How much vinegar?

563
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,007
Or... what's it called,

564
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,982
not sodium-- the brown liquid.

565
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,212
Stick to the vinegar, O.K.?

566
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,378
How much?

567
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,581
A lot.

568
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,211
Change.

569
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,316
Oh, fucking, so fucking stupid. Fucking...

570
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,231
Oh, fuck no.

571
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,362
Fuck, man. Fuck me! So fucking stupid!

572
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,270
Fuck!

573
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,327
We've moved on to breakfast.

574
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,935
Don't,
don't sit, don't sit there.

575
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,200
Sit, sit behind me.

576
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,605
Sit in the next booth.

577
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,975
Sit behind me.

578
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,742
- Like this?
- Turn around. Turn around.

579
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,750
Did you get to the hospital?

580
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,516
Yeah.

581
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,023
How's he doing?

582
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,650
He's dead.

583
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,490
What?

584
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,656
I held his hand while he went-- it was creepy.

585
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,597
You're fucking kidding me.

586
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,068
I said I was one of his friends
and they told me to comfort him.

587
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,695
He's dead?

588
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,502
Yeah.

589
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,804
Oh, and they know it's poisoning.

590
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:28,879
What?

591
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,574
Well, I heard the nurses talking
and they said poisoning.

592
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,708
So...

593
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,251
Fuck.

594
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:44,093
Are we O.K.? 'Cause I've never
been in this situation before.

595
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,128
Where are you going?

596
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,561
Where are you going?

597
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,924
John Rudgate!

598
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,989
This your van?

599
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,722
Yeah.

600
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,730
You O.K. there?

601
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,562
Bad danish.

602
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,796
You know, I was wondering
what you were up to yesterday.

603
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,636
- What do you care?
- Just following up on some reports.

604
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,232
What reports?

605
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:37,644
If you're so interested,
we could go down to the station, I could fill you in.

606
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,613
You charging me with something?

607
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,275
We're just talking.

608
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:46,482
'Cause if you're not charging me with something,
why don't you just back the fuck off?!

609
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,353
You watch it.

610
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,154
Yeah, I'll watch it.

611
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,989
And I'll watch you.

612
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,291
I know it's you...

613
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,730
Rugged.

614
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,359
You're the rotten danish.

615
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,075
"I know you did it?"

616
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,667
Yeah.

617
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,406
Does he think I did it?

618
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,505
What the fuck does that matter, man?

619
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,380
Well, I don't know.
I've never been in this situation before.

620
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,783
Neither have I.

621
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,253
I mean, yes, yes, I have,
but not like this, you know?

622
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,119
I knew that he was gonna get sick,

623
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,787
I knew he was gonna get very, very sick.
I didn't think he was gonna fucking die.

624
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,456
Oh, God, we are fucked, man. We are so fucked.

625
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,157
Why are we fucked?

626
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,664
He didn't book me.

627
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,074
- What's going on?
- They got nothing, Lagrand.

628
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,176
If they had anything on us,
we'd be squatting on a steel toilet right now.

629
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,585
Why are you throwing those things?

630
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,024
All right, here's the plan, man.

631
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,355
We got to wash the van.

632
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,054
We got to wash our clothes.

633
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,756
We got to come up with an alibi.

634
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,856
Something solid. Uh...

635
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,160
I'll buy a <i>TV Guide</i>.

636
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,263
What else?

637
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,304
The check!

638
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,440
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

639
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,186
Hey.

640
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,656
Hey.

641
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,283
What are you doing?

642
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,385
Where do we keep the checks?

643
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,622
Why?

644
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,699
Because I need to buy something.

645
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,596
What? What?!

646
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,965
What's the difference, Cheryl?

647
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,129
Fine...

648
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,208
Just wait. God.

649
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,748
And make sure you put the name
and the amount in here

650
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,249
so that I can put it into Quicken.

651
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,649
The name and the account.

652
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,948
<i>Amount</i>.

653
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,249
Where are you going?

654
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,324
Um, hardware store.

655
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,360
We have an account there,
that's the difference.

656
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,328
We get charged 15 cents per check.

657
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,630
There's a quarter.

658
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,569
And we get the float,
and I get an account summary.

659
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,472
Well, I just wish you'd clear that deal with me first.

660
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,611
- Did you get it?
- No.

661
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,241
What's the problem?

662
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,445
- Where are you going?
- We have an account there.

663
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,748
So?

664
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,255
Why can't we use one of your checks?

665
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,326
I told you, we're not throwing good money after bad.

666
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,986
I got a rebate check in there already.
That's what this whole thing's about.

667
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,055
Well, I don't want to fuck things up, O.K.?
I mean, we have an account there, it floats...

668
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,431
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- They have to be balanced, and that's the books.

669
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,595
You're not making any sense.

670
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,808
Cheryl's gonna make a fuss, all right?

671
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,141
Cheryl? What the fuck does she care about it?

672
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,738
She signs the checks sometimes.

673
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,340
You let her do that?

674
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,318
Well, when I'm busy and
I don't have one moment to do anything.

675
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,787
That's fucking twisted, man.

676
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,024
Well, also, we're out of checks, so that's that.

677
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,496
Out of checks?

678
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,968
That's easy, man-- we go to the bank,
we get a new check. Problem solved.

679
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,234
Come on. Come on!

680
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,366
You shouldn't let Cheryl handle your money, man.

681
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,068
It's like handling your balls.

682
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,510
- She's fucking 17.
- She's 19.

683
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,412
Whatever. It's fucked up.

684
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,116
Got it.

685
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,590
Great.

686
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,184
John!

687
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,626
John!

688
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,924
Mrs. Blodgett, hi.

689
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:52,764
- I can't talk right now, I got to go.
- You stay right there!

690
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,098
This lady's crazy, man.

691
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,364
She's a friend of my mother's.

692
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,997
I did a job for her, like,
five years ago or something.

693
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,076
It was last week.

694
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,542
And he didn't do it.

695
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,408
That litter box was filthy.

696
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,981
I just gave you that job as a favor to your mother.

697
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,846
Against my better judgment!

698
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,798
$3.40.

699
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,561
Check? O.K.

700
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,005
There you go.

701
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:39,404
Have a pleasant one.

702
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,677
Yeah?

703
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:45,619
I already have one, so...

704
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,190
I don't need to write a check.

705
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,493
O.K.

706
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,459
Did you see the checks?

707
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,092
- Yeah.
- Where are they?

708
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,693
Um, under the register.

709
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,170
Ah, good work, man.

710
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,740
No alarms, right?

711
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,366
Yeah, I saw a sticker.

712
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,308
Fuck.

713
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,005
All right, well, sometimes those stickers are decoys.

714
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,674
Did it say like, uh, "Acme Alarm", "U.S.A. Alarm",

715
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,344
"Official Alarm Company", something like that?

716
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,750
It said "Granite State".

717
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,845
Fuck. That's real.

718
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,016
That's who my mom uses.

719
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,922
Well, you can get by an alarm, right?

720
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,724
Usually. Not Granite State, man,
that's the real shit.

721
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,027
I know a guy...

722
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,126
Gazaniga.

723
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:38,037
Not the kind of guy you want to work with, man.
He's a fucking loose cannon.

724
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,371
You know anybody?

725
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,843
Um...

726
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,641
No. No.

727
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,739
Fuck.

728
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,819
This guy's fucking Satan.

729
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,454
You ever watch U.F.C.?

730
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,189
No.

731
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,288
Take two fighters, put 'em in a cage,

732
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,334
take away the rules and see what happens.

733
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,198
Anything goes:

734
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,467
pinching, biting, strangulation.

735
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,600
- He does that?
- He wants to, yeah.

736
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,476
That's the kind of sick, messed-up motherfucker
we're dealing with here.

737
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:23,913
What's up, Gazaniga?

738
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,813
What do you want?

739
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,222
You doing U.F.C.?

740
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,421
Got the application.

741
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,259
Can you still get by an alarm?

742
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,855
What are you talking about?

743
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,400
My mom's house?

744
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,561
I don't know shit about your mom's house.

745
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,763
You got by her alarm.

746
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,274
I didn't fucking get by anything.

747
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,367
Listen, man. I don't care about that, O.K.?

748
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,638
It's in the past.

749
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,338
I just need some help here.

750
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,916
Just don't accuse me of stealing
from your ho-bag mom.

751
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,384
Fine. Whatever. I'm sorry. O.K.?

752
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,148
So, here's the deal.

753
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,655
We've been casing this store.

754
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,588
Who's the giraffe?

755
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:05,786
It's Lagrand. He runs the U-Lock.

756
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,989
No shit.

757
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,622
Alex.

758
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,701
Jeff.

759
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,669
You got two lockers over there, right? Two sizes?

760
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,329
Yeah.

761
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,407
What's the little one run?

762
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,908
- Could I, uh, get a go-cart in there?
- Yeah. I mean...

763
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,774
We can help you with any need...

764
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,074
O.K., could you guys pick this up some other time?

765
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,274
Listen, here's the deal.

766
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,510
Me and Lagrand have been casing this store

767
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,553
and they've had some major fucking cash sales, man.

768
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,386
Major sales, all cash.

769
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,959
How much?

770
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,584
I think, like, 600...

771
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,356
600 bucks, easy.

772
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,365
Talking about the U-Lock, right?

773
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,903
No, man, he's not robbing
his own fucking place, O.K.?

774
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,334
- Don't worry about that, listen.
- I can't.

775
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:53,341
The question is: can you still get by
a Granite State alarm?

776
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,447
I get half.

777
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,952
Fine.

778
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,283
So, you can do it?

779
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,891
Oh, yeah.

780
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,392
O.K.

781
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,792
I never knew you were into this kind of shit, John.

782
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,233
There's a lot about me you don't know, Gazaniga.

783
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,463
A lot.

784
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,106
Let's go, Lagrand.

785
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:38,379
Motherfucker was wearing
my mother's engagement ring, man!

786
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,547
He really broke into your house?

787
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,817
Fucking garage sale.

788
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,950
My skates, my <i>Cars And Drivers</i>.

789
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,425
Good shit, man.

790
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,895
Yeah, um, would you please tell me

791
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,162
if you sold a small gold charm

792
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,033
with engraving on the back?

793
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,696
Caught a break in the Connelly case.

794
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,740
You know, I'll, I'll call you right back.

795
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,174
My ears on the street are saying John Rudgate did it.

796
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,974
- Rudgate.
- Vandalism. Theft. Murder.

797
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,843
It's a slippery slope, Putney.

798
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,782
He was combative when I questioned him.

799
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,479
So I'm gonna take you off the speaker case.

800
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,953
It's just...

801
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,490
Well, if this all connects, I want to do it right.

802
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,457
Put this Rudgate guy away.

803
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,153
O.K.

804
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,696
Gift for the Mrs.?

805
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:29,232
"From loving cock."

806
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,604
I found it in her drawer.

807
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,735
Must be the name of a store.

808
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,508
She's, um... she's cheating on me.

809
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,743
Oh, come on, Stacy's crazy about you.

810
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,785
It's fucking Susan.

811
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,980
Well, maybe she's upset about your language.

812
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,216
Yeah, right.

813
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,520
Look, I'll, um...

814
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:54,620
I'll give you the paperwork
I have on the speaker case, O.K.?

815
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,757
Look, if you want to talk about anything...

816
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,300
my door's always open.

817
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,802
Thank you.

818
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:35,104
Come on, baby. Come to papa.

819
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,297
There. Right there.

820
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,430
Got it?

821
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,632
Yeah.

822
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:39,970
Oh, yeah.

823
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,509
There she is.

824
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,207
Yah!

825
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:49,242
Aah...

826
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,444
What the fuck was that?

827
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,520
Jesus.

828
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,022
Oh, yeah. It's done.

829
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,286
That's a bullshit way to do it, man.

830
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,725
Anybody could have done that.

831
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,591
No, anybody couldn't have.

832
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,562
Where's the fucking cash drawer?

833
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,759
How come there wasn't a hole in my mom's wall?

834
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,165
Because I didn't fucking do that.

835
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,237
Where's the fucking cash drawer?

836
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,703
Is that why you have my CDs?

837
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,036
I didn't have your fucking CDs, John!

838
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,905
The cash drawer's right here.

839
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,136
Good eyes, Jeff.

840
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,236
Thank you.

841
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,686
Haah!

842
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,084
You're amazing.

843
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,254
Uh, where's the cash?

844
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,524
There's, like, 43 bucks here.

845
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,894
Oh, what do you know?

846
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,332
Lagrand, where's the fucking checks?

847
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,596
Here's a 20.

848
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,729
Lagrand, where's the fucking checks?

849
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,898
John, where's the fucking 600?

850
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,976
I told you <i>about</i> 600.

851
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:51,673
There better be something fucking nice
in this shithole.

852
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,749
This is shit!

853
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,545
Where's the checks, Jeff?

854
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,916
Here's where he was hiding 'em.

855
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,618
This is shit!

856
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,766
It's an inkidata rebate check,
man, 15 bucks.

857
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,896
It was, like, ink-jet or ink cartridge

858
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,372
or inkidata or some shit like that.

859
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,514
Holy shit!

860
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,516
Fucking porno!

861
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,415
Big time.

862
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,385
Holy shit.

863
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,422
Fucking dirty dog.

864
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,187
I'm calling all this shit.

865
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,285
Yeah, go nuts, man.

866
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,833
"John J. Rudgate."

867
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,164
Fucking jewelry, too.

868
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,567
Nice.

869
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,107
This shit looks targeted, man.
We got to jack all this shit.

870
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,143
Bust it up.

871
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,843
Fucking roll.

872
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,460
Fucking X-Actos?

873
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,258
Oughta get 50 bucks, though,
for these badasses.

874
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,230
From who?

875
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,925
Garage sale.

876
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,468
Aw, no, man, no fucking way!

877
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,435
No garage sale. Not again.

878
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,633
What the fuck do you mean, "again," John?

879
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,973
You can't fence this shit.
You'll tip the cops.

880
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,638
Sorry, man, I got bills.

881
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,841
I got the sweetest fucking love seat on layaway.

882
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,076
You got bills to pay?

883
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:38,450
Why don't you sell that ring
on your pinkie finger?

884
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,547
You know what, John? I'm gonna come up there
and show you this fucking ring.

885
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,852
No fucking garage sale.

886
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,154
Fine. You stop me.

887
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:48,424
Fine. We're fucking buying this shit off you, then.

888
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,829
Fine.

889
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,902
And this shit I'm fucking keeping...

890
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,971
for my personal...

891
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,271
Those speakers are worth
a hell of a lot more than this shit.

892
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,866
They're nice.

893
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,003
All right. No backsies.

894
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,547
I'm just saying, man,
you're getting a hell of a deal here.

895
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,482
Hell of a deal.

896
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,383
Keys.

897
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,887
When you bringing her back?

898
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,956
What?

899
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,048
The van.

900
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,854
"Yuh, right!"

901
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,294
I'm serious.

902
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,889
The van was part of the deal.

903
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,992
The fuck it was.

904
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,436
You think I want these ugly fucking speakers?

905
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,507
Oh, God.

906
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:34,099
You know what?

907
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,177
Fuck this.

908
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,711
This is why I don't...

909
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,509
Jeff, give me a hand
with these Taiwanese pieces of shit.

910
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:40,583
Hold on, hold on!

911
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,617
You know how much that van's worth?

912
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,812
- This is a piece of shit.
- It's not a piece of shit, man!

913
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,788
The exhaust on that fucking thing is brand-new!

914
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,121
Do you know what the blue book is on that guy?

915
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,956
- Nobody gets blue book.
- Fuck that, man, I get blue book!

916
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,189
The thing's got tow package, cassette,

917
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,232
the heat fucking cranks-- I roast in that thing!

918
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,941
Fine, fine, fucking take it.

919
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,977
Just take it, take it.
Take it, please.

920
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,239
Get the fuck out of here, please. Go.

921
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,354
Keys.

922
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,659
O.K.

923
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,626
Hey, Jeff, you find the right buyer,

924
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,596
you'll do all right with this stuff.

925
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,031
Thanks.

926
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,552
You're gonna kill him, aren't ya?

927
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,644
He's not all bad.

928
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,524
That was a good van.

929
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,787
Pretty good.

930
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,828
It's just, like, when does it stop, you know?

931
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,161
The killing.

932
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,371
Whoa, whoa-- what the fuck are you doing?

933
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,100
- What?
- This is evidence, man.

934
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,039
We can't keep this shit here.

935
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,839
That ties it to me with a fucking ribbon.

936
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,607
Well, what are we supposed to do?

937
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,478
I don't know, fucking...

938
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,141
fucking bury it or something, man.

939
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,220
There's got to be a shovel in here somewhere.

940
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,757
Fucking Gazaniga, man.

941
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,986
Half the place is gardening shit.

942
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,427
He can't steal one fucking spade?!

943
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,964
There's probably something inside.

944
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,300
Hey.

945
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,003
It's a fucking snow shovel, man.

946
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,012
It's a snow shovel.

947
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,747
Here's another... one.

948
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,516
Oh, shit hot, man.

949
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,615
That's good. Yeah, grab that.

950
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,125
What are you doing?

951
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,525
What are <i>you</i> doing?

952
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,859
I thought we had a break-in.

953
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,956
No, I'm just getting a shovel.

954
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,364
Who's this?

955
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:13,730
That's Rugged, remember?

956
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,360
I told you about him.

957
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,563
Oh, yeah.

958
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,504
Rugged. Rudman.

959
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,666
Doreen. Mom.

960
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,006
Clam. Security guy.

961
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,773
Yeah, that's right. I looked around.

962
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:29,011
You got a lot of, uh,
weaknesses in your perimeter.

963
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,212
You mean like the fact
that you two left the gate wide open?

964
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,085
I thought I told you to leave it locked
after 9:00, Jeff.

965
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,126
I thought we had a break-in
with all that crap lying around.

966
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,161
Yeah, well, if it had been a real break-in,

967
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,128
that crap wouldn't be there.
It'd be gone.

968
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,426
But you don't need to worry
about someone breaking in with me around.

969
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,502
Not if they value their health.

970
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,537
Is that your service? Fear-mongering?

971
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,073
Maybe I should just post your picture
up on the gate.

972
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,435
It's a lot more than mongering.

973
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,641
I've had a security license for 10 years, O.K.?

974
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,717
What did you do here?!

975
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,615
You know what, you guys get out of here.

976
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,483
Clean up outside. I'll take care of this.

977
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,317
Goddamn it, Jeff.

978
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,584
I had this stuff organized.

979
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,660
Yeah.

980
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,761
You sure she's your real sister?

981
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,960
Your mom didn't marry some other dude
or something?

982
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,664
Yes. No.

983
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:28,733
I guarantee you there was some kind
of hanky-panky going on somewhere.

984
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,678
Hey, hey. What about there?

985
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,341
Sure.

986
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,315
Yeah, that's good.

987
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,684
Shit hot, man. That's perfect.

988
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,795
It's all rock.

989
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,023
It's called the fucking Granite State for a reason.

990
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,232
It's gonna take a long time.

991
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,238
It would go a lot quicker...

992
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,103
if you did some work.

993
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,505
Look at this pile I got here.

994
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,736
What have you got there, man?

995
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,812
You got nothing. Come on.

996
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,609
I got a bad shovel. It's all bent.

997
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,013
All right, all right.

998
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,609
Let's just stop complaining
and get the job done, O.K.?

999
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,995
Oh, fuck. Motherfucker.

1000
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,499
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1001
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,330
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

1002
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:32,102
Stump grinders... band saws...

1003
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,336
outdoor lighting.

1004
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:39,039
I had a beautiful two-person raft right there,
and now it's...

1005
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,446
this is a fucking insane asylum here.

1006
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,348
- Yeah.
- And I don't have insurance.

1007
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,317
The bean counters wouldn't insure me.

1008
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,888
I was high-risk.

1009
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,547
Fucking cunts.

1010
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,854
What do you make of this?

1011
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,296
It was probably more than one guy.

1012
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,426
They disengaged the alarm...

1013
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,299
cleaned out the register.

1014
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,633
They probably were disappointed with the take

1015
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,708
and then they, uh, got a little violent, Chief.

1016
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,367
A little violent?

1017
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,944
Maybe they were rushed.

1018
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,105
No, look at the cubbies, Putney.

1019
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,409
I mean, this is all gratuitous.

1020
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,508
What are they gonna do with this stuff,
hold a garage sale?

1021
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:17,916
No, no, I got another idea.

1022
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,478
I think our culprits
really wanted to stick it to this guy.

1023
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:22,956
What do you mean, like revenge?

1024
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,687
Shit!

1025
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,729
Cunts took my pornos!

1026
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,355
Vintage shit! Gone!

1027
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:37,061
Why don't you, uh, get some shots of the outside?

1028
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,607
O.K., Chief.

1029
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,939
Mr. Hesh.

1030
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,274
I want to ask you something.

1031
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,816
I want you to think hard.

1032
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,613
Think you might have any enemies?

1033
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,210
Why's that?

1034
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,347
Well, there's just so much gratuitous damage here.

1035
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:59,155
I find it hard to believe
that this is just a simple burglary.

1036
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,196
Sure. Right.

1037
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,095
I mean, who the fuck steals X-Actos?

1038
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,500
Is there anybody you can think of
who might have something against you?

1039
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,539
Yeah. My next-door neighbor.

1040
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,133
- Yeah? What happened there?
- The guy's a cunt.

1041
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,544
Plays his goddamn drums
while I'm relaxing in my spa.

1042
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,913
So, why would he do this?

1043
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,452
I don't know.

1044
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,283
I hurt his dog.

1045
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,950
I mean, you know,
it was kind of an accident, but...

1046
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,721
It really wasn't, you know.
But it looked like it.

1047
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,523
His name?

1048
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,097
Stallard.

1049
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,893
The roofer?

1050
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,558
I don't think so.

1051
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:43,230
This guy's in a wheelchair.

1052
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,773
It could be that cunt from the pharmacy.

1053
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,935
- What's his name?
- Who? Marty Swain? Swain drug?

1054
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,512
No, the kid at the register.

1055
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,376
With the pimples?

1056
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,539
What's the cunt's name?

1057
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,412
Hey, watch the...
Corky...?

1058
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,976
- Watch the language, will you?
- All right.

1059
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,851
Anybody else?

1060
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:08,125
Well, my kid's teachers: math, gym, English.

1061
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,393
Tell me about them.

1062
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,492
You know, they were picking on him,
so I made some threats.

1063
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,571
What kind of threats?

1064
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:20,164
Ah... "If you do this, I'll do that..." You know.

1065
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,675
Names?

1066
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,406
Yeah, uh... Mr. Harris... Mrs. Trapezio...

1067
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,811
And, uh... whatever the cunt.

1068
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,110
Uh, short little lesbo...

1069
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,744
Look, I'm not gonna ask you again
about the language!

1070
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,048
Sixth-grade gym.

1071
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,453
She's sixth-grade gym.

1072
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,461
Anybody else?

1073
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:43,327
No. That's it.

1074
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:47,493
O.K., well, uh, I'm gonna talk
to some of these people.

1075
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:51,596
If any other names come up,
tell me about it, O.K.?

1076
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:53,675
Yeah.

1077
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,835
Uh, hold, hold up a sec.

1078
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,971
Uh...

1079
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:00,514
Maybe there is somebody else.

1080
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,675
- Um...
- Yeah?

1081
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,082
There's this guy.

1082
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,088
Uh... I've been banging his wife.

1083
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,418
It's, uh...

1084
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,685
It's, uh...

1085
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,886
Guess who.

1086
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,826
It's your partner.

1087
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,330
It's the guy out there.

1088
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,635
- Putney?
- Yeah.

1089
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,209
Does he know it's you?

1090
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,677
That's the thing.

1091
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,614
I don't know.

1092
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,050
You think he'd do this?

1093
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:51,229
So, what do you think?
Any hunches?

1094
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,131
Well, I, uh... I think we should, uh,

1095
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,363
maybe start at the swap meets.

1096
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,805
See where they're fencing this stuff.

1097
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,571
You seem to think it's more than one person.

1098
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,839
I doubt anyone did this alone.

1099
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,505
Uh-huh.

1100
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,480
You know, you're a good cop.

1101
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,245
Good cop, Putney.

1102
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,617
You know, maybe I was holding you back
on this speaker case.

1103
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:17,818
Bet you'd like another crack at that one, huh?

1104
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:18,985
Yeah, sure.

1105
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,494
All right, buddy.

1106
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,893
O.K., you're on the varsity now.

1107
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,931
Here, now, give me that camera.

1108
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,467
I will take this case...

1109
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,367
and that...

1110
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,838
and you stay on Rudgate and the goon...

1111
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,909
and you call me if there's any developments.

1112
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:37,342
Or if you... you know,
if you need to talk about anything.

1113
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:41,314
Anything at all, all right?

1114
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,045
Sure. O.K.

1115
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,711
O.K.

1116
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:46,879
Thanks, Chief.

1117
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,047
Congratulations.

1118
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,284
O.K.

1119
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,608
Rugged.

1120
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,270
What time is it?

1121
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,745
9:00.

1122
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,247
Fuck it.

1123
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,817
This is deep enough, man.

1124
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,182
Let's bury the shit here.

1125
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,759
What the fuck?

1126
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,630
Was that there?

1127
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,498
Where the fuck are we?

1128
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:37,538
I mean, how could you not have noticed that?

1129
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,631
I don't know.

1130
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,472
This is a major, major fuck-up, Lagrand!

1131
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,375
This is a goddamn embarrassment, man!

1132
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,675
Fuck!

1133
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,374
Pick up the flashlights, man.

1134
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,112
Let's go.

1135
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,969
I've got a blue van selling speakers.

1136
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:25,213
License plate 1-5-4-0-1-7-1.

1137
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:26,788
Copy, car 12.

1138
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,824
I'm making a stop.

1139
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,908
Just you?

1140
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,740
Yeah.

1141
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,178
License and registration, please.

1142
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:58,447
Yeah, uh... I lost my license.

1143
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:07,121
Um... just, uh, got the van, actually, so, um...

1144
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,754
Step out of the vehicle, please.

1145
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,902
Step to the front of the vehicle.

1146
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,908
Yeah. Uh, what's the problem?

1147
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,204
Where'd you get the speakers?

1148
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,176
Oh, they came with the van.

1149
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,448
You know, if they're stolen,
that's got nothing to do with me.

1150
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,543
That's, uh, the previous owner.

1151
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:37,717
I can give you his name, if you like.

1152
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,794
What's that?

1153
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,192
Oh, that's, uh...

1154
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,229
That's definitely not stolen.

1155
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,698
That's from my girlfriend.

1156
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,307
"From loving cunt."

1157
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:57,243
Uh... she's a freaky one.

1158
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,337
Is that what you think, cock?

1159
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,348
Uh, what?

1160
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,941
You think she's freaky, cock?

1161
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,850
Uh... I don't know.

1162
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,615
You think she's married, cock?

1163
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,247
What?

1164
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,752
- Fuck!
- What the fuck, cock?

1165
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,020
Huh?

1166
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:40,350
Yeah... you motherfucker.

1167
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,287
I killed a man because of you.

1168
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:43,653
Help!

1169
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,420
I killed Rod Connelly.

1170
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,427
Help...!

1171
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,862
I'm gonna regret that the rest of my life.

1172
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,957
I'm not gonna regret killing you.

1173
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,038
'Cause you're the real cock, aren't you? Huh?

1174
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,937
You fuck people's wives?

1175
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,202
You fucked my wife?

1176
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,402
You wife fucker.

1177
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:07,847
What the...?

1178
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,946
Oh, you motherfuck.

1179
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,093
You motherfuck!

1180
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,058
God... Fuck!

1181
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,494
Fuck!

1182
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,725
You fucking piece of shit.

1183
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,650
Good work, man.

1184
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,814
Let's go.

1185
01:13:56,265 --> 01:14:00,725
That is why you dig to six feet, Lagrand.

1186
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,974
O.K.

1187
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:17,051
We'll throw this in the pond.

1188
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,050
Car seven, please escort the pastor

1189
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,591
to Susan Putney's house.

1190
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,923
Provide her with any assistance she might need.

1191
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:30,260
Chief. Found these in the van.

1192
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,105
Lagrand.

1193
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,542
We've got the goon.

1194
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:48,014
You ever still think about that logger?

1195
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,482
All the fucking time, man.

1196
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,577
'Cause I've been thinking about that guy, Oldfield,

1197
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,553
and I'll tell you...

1198
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,817
I wish I didn't go to that hospital.

1199
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,722
Hey.

1200
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,158
You stop that.

1201
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,856
You stop that right now. You listen to me.

1202
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,798
That fuck had it coming.

1203
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:09,632
Just...

1204
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,729
What?

1205
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,900
Just don't kill Alex, O.K.?

1206
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,607
Yeah.

1207
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,844
Six fucking...

1208
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:30,652
You don't evict someone
for six fucking days, Beckett!

1209
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:31,953
Fuck.

1210
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,662
Come on.

1211
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,893
All right.

1212
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,129
Jimmy this fucking thing.

1213
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,339
Fuck.

1214
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,552
Oh, shit.

1215
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:03,022
It says "Homicide".

1216
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,635
Come back, back, back, back.

1217
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,745
Should we kick it?

1218
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:32,115
No, no. I got a key.

1219
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:12,816
What about those old train tracks,

1220
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,226
the ones that run behind Neighbor's Market?

1221
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,528
- What about 'em?
- Well, they go north, right?

1222
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,159
They go to Canada.

1223
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,794
You think they got a border check there?

1224
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:27,397
Not for a train, right?
I mean, a train that doesn't even run.

1225
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,443
Why would they have a border check?

1226
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:30,738
It doesn't make sense.

1227
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,177
Let's give it a try.

1228
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,154
Fuck... almost out of gas.

1229
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,190
You got any cash?

1230
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,349
Fuck it.

1231
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:45,926
Let's pump and run.

1232
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:49,555
Can't fuck up our rap sheets any worse.

1233
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:50,689
Let's ride.

1234
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:26,200
Hey, you got to pay first after 8:00.

1235
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,098
Just ignore him.

1236
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:29,397
Hey.

1237
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,972
Hey, man, you hear me?

1238
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,139
Marcus?

1239
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,339
I didn't know you worked here, man.

1240
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,280
Listen, I got some shit going on right now.

1241
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,908
I'll pay you later, O.K.?

1242
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:44,986
Yeah, I heard.

1243
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:48,784
Listen, uh, sorry
about that whole diploma thing, you know?

1244
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,653
I fucked up.

1245
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:53,227
And I totally believe you about Connelly.

1246
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,159
Wait. What'd you hear?

1247
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:58,596
On TV. The killing.

1248
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,361
Really?

1249
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:04,337
Yeah. So, uh, you guys just take
anything you want, O.K.?

1250
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,373
Yeah.

1251
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,580
It's on TV.

1252
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,015
TV?

1253
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,020
I never seen him like that before.

1254
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,992
Shaking like a leaf.

1255
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,631
Come on.

1256
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,337
Hey, what the fuck are we hurrying for, man?

1257
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,710
Let's go back there.

1258
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,478
Get some free chips,
a little sustenance for the outlaws.

1259
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:59,022
Chief, I spotted them at Neighbor's Market.

1260
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,992
Copy, car 12.

1261
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,222
So, Marcus...

1262
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,697
you, uh, you think
you might want to work with me again?

1263
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,462
Oh, yeah. Sure, man.

1264
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,730
It's like you said, nobody fucks with you.

1265
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,362
I don't know, man.

1266
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,842
I mean, last time you had a lot of trouble
following instructions.

1267
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,912
- You think that's gonna change?
- Definitely.

1268
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,537
Ooh... ice.

1269
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,946
Fuck!

1270
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,024
You're surrounded, Rudgate.

1271
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,620
Give yourselves up.

1272
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,926
Come out slowly with your hands high in the air

1273
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:42,299
like you're playing a nice little game of volleyball.

1274
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,269
Oh, fuck... so stupid, man.

1275
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,900
So fucking stupid!

1276
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,945
What are we gonna do?

1277
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,014
They're everywhere, man.

1278
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,445
We're fucked. We're fucking surrounded.

1279
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,109
Let's just tell 'em the truth, Rugged.
I mean, it was kind of an accident.

1280
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:00,245
How do you accidentally kill a cop?

1281
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:01,822
He wasn't a cop.

1282
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:03,049
Lieutenant Putney.

1283
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,149
They showed his picture on TV.

1284
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,921
Well, as usual, they got it wrong, man.

1285
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:07,995
He wasn't a fucking cop.

1286
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,690
He was some piece-of-shit plumber, John Oldfield.

1287
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,630
Oldfield?

1288
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:16,465
- Yeah.
- The guy who got food poisoning?

1289
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,300
It wasn't food poisoning.

1290
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,395
Yeah. It, it was.

1291
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:20,906
At the Clam Shack.

1292
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,840
I was working that shift.

1293
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,674
Well, tell him that, man.
He held his hand while he died.

1294
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,748
You know what?

1295
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,750
The nurses did say food poisoning.

1296
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,444
I forgot that.

1297
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,022
I forgot the "food".

1298
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,988
Food poisoning?

1299
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,957
That's why I'm working the pumps.

1300
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,961
They closed us down, dude.

1301
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,031
Let's go, cop killers.

1302
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,930
Give you 30 seconds to give yourselves up.

1303
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,560
So, what the fuck are they talking about?!

1304
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,162
So... you're not the cop killers?

1305
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,832
No!

1306
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,933
This is all about some fucking cop?

1307
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,102
Lieutenant Putney.

1308
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,112
We didn't kill Lieutenant Puppy.

1309
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,579
I don't even know who he is.

1310
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:01,944
Then who did you kill?

1311
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,951
We didn't kill anybody.

1312
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:08,580
I didn't think you'd kill anybody.

1313
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,488
Let's tell them, Rugged.

1314
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,561
Shut up, Lagrand. Shut up.

1315
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,391
We killed somebody.

1316
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,091
Who?

1317
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:20,064
We killed Putney.

1318
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,898
You said you killed Oldfield.

1319
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,632
That was a lie, man.
That was a cover story.

1320
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,470
What the fuck are you talking about?

1321
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:32,034
Lagrand, we fucking killed a man, O.K.?

1322
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,341
We killed a cop.

1323
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,177
We killed a cop and if they catch us,

1324
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,683
we're gonna fucking fry for it.

1325
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,777
What?

1326
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,947
We got to make a run for it, man.

1327
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,458
We got to get the mopeds and make for the border.

1328
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,221
You're crazy.

1329
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,887
Yeah, I am fucking crazy.

1330
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:52,262
You've got to be pretty fucking crazy to kill a cop.

1331
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,130
And you fucking remember that, Marcus!

1332
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:57,602
You tell all your little friends
and you tell everybody in this town.

1333
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,904
John J. Rudgate is a fucking cop killer!

1334
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,483
I, I... I think I winged him.

1335
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,782
No one could believe
he went out the front door,

1336
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:17,119
let alone make it past the bullets...

1337
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,523
but the dude fucking did it.

1338
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,330
The police were sure they'd hit him.

1339
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,595
They even found some blood, but...

1340
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,568
Chief Monson cut his hand on his car door,

1341
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,334
so it could have been from that.

1342
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:38,640
I'm thinking all those Marlboro cartons made Rugged
a fatter Target than he was.

1343
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,148
I mean, the dude looked like Jabba The Hut
running out of there.

1344
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,879
Sounded like him too.

1345
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,387
When the nationwide manhunt didn't turn him up,

1346
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,426
we all knew he rode the railroad tracks
straight up to Canada.

1347
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,223
Some even said he was running drugs
from South America,

1348
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,458
'cause his mom's phone bill
showed a call from La Paz.

1349
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:01,262
She said it was a wrong number.

1350
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,570
Whenever weird shit happened in town--

1351
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:13,545
like the high school mascot getting served up
at the awards banquet--

1352
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,616
people blamed Rugged.

1353
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,277
Channel Five even did a special report.

1354
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,549
This kid's a fucking legend.

1355
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,419
My friend.

1356
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,658
Women whispered about him.

1357
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,128
- Kids started talking like him.
- Shit hot, man.

1358
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:34,759
The army-navy store
moved a lot more parkas and knit caps.

1359
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:37,064
Rugged put our 'hood on the map.

1360
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:41,336
People were proud
a hustler from west bumfuck came to be something.

1361
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,308
A renegade, an outlaw,

1362
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,006
maybe even a kingpin in the Bolivian drug trade.

1363
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:51,484
As for me and Lagrand,
we were booked and released.

1364
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,986
"Lack of evidence," they said.

1365
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,752
Lagrand bought his own U-Lock
to get out from under his sister.

1366
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,657
Went out of business in about a week.

1367
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:05,062
I think he's working for Alex Gazaniga
doing pet grooming or some shit like that.

1368
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,463
Down! Down!

1369
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,502
Down, weimeraner.

1370
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,731
As for me,
I hate waiting on a paycheck,

1371
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,573
so I ended up picking up some of the crumbs
Rugged left behind.

1372
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:21,115
I sent in buttloads of rebate coupons,
ran a fake charity,

1373
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,447
harvested sod off the football field...

1374
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:30,923
But my best scam I called
"A.A.A.A. Trash Collection Service".

1375
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:36,019
I dodged the landfill fees 'cause
I used the dumpster behind the coffee shop instead...

1376
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:47,803
Till some fuckface caught on and padlocked it.

1377
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:55,008
So there I was, stuck with a full load
of stinky diapers and stale beer.

1378
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:58,677
I decided to drive out of town
and dump it in the woods.

1379
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,414
I found a clearing down an old logging road,

1380
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:04,287
a place even turkey hunters wouldn't bother with...

1381
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:07,555
Big enough to keep me working till Christmas.

1382
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,601
And that's when I came across it.

1383
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,938
He'd gone over 10 miles.

1384
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,772
Must have been riding on pure nicotine.

1385
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:26,278
I thought of all the people I'd tell...

1386
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:30,511
the cops, the newspapers, Lagrand...

1387
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,415
and then I thought twice.

1388
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,316
So he didn't make it.

1389
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:40,485
Big fucking deal.

1390
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,892
I bet if you looked hard enough,

1391
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:45,591
you'd find Billy The Kid pissed his pants
once or twice.

1392
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,671
So I'm not telling anyone.

1393
01:26:55,777 --> 01:27:00,077
Legends are just too hard to come by around here.
