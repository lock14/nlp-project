00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,635
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

161
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,055
He had it on him when he bolted.

162
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,522
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

163
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,403
She is no longer a factor.

164
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,949
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

165
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:01,077
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

166
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,505
Forgive me, sir?

167
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:15,009
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

168
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,845
He didn't lose us.

169
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,723
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

170
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,143
And then something hit us, something...

171
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,063
Something big hit us!

172
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,359
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

173
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,031
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

174
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,535
Well, it's gone.

175
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,538
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

176
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,750
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

- That was Banner.

- No, I don't.

You're aware that we've got an

Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

219
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,311
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

220
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,606
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

221
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,319
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

222
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,198
And something went very wrong.

223
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,535
Or it went very right.

224

As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

227
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,797

229
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,345
was very promising.

- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

231
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,267
He is not one of us.

put it in the body I had ten years ago,

238
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,417

if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

564
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:10,016
is that going to be a lasting cure

565

by even the smallest integer

You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

824
01:44:59,908 --> 01:45:04,329
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

01:45:04,412 --> 01:45:07,291
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

- Stark.
- General.

01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:23,140
You should listen.

<font color="#808080">STARK :</font> What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

832
01:45:29,396 --> 01:45:30,980
Who's "we"?
