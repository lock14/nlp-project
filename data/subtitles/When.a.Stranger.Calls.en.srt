1
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,336
Hello.

2
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,399
Is that Alice?

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,631
No, I think you have got
the wrong number.

4
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,675
Well, what's your name?

5
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,834
This is Stacy.

6
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:34,503
Wh--? Who is this?

7
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:36,805
Hello.

8
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:37,525
Hello.

9
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:01,988
Hello.

10
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,169
Who is this?

11
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,713
- Hey, Mr. Wilson.
- Hey, Dennis.

12
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,212
A.J. Charlie. Katherine.

13
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,421
A.J.

14
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,053
Charlie.

15
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:40,521
Andrew Joseph.

16
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:47,502
A.J.

17
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,533
Charlie? Katherine.

18
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,202
Hello.

19
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:07,617
Hello.

20
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,176
Please stop calling me.

21
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,290
Wait. Let's see it.

22
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,490
- I am winning you.
- Come on, you guys.

23
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:05,667
Hello, sir.

24
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,502
We have a 44-year-old
white female....

25
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,665
What's going on?

26
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,936
We were patrolling a block away
when the call came.

27
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,171
- Who made the call?
- I am not sure, sir.

28
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,816
- Well, where did you find them?
- Upstairs bedroom.

29
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,576
- Hey, Harv.
- Hey, Hines. You're growing a beard.

30
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,980
- Yes, I am.
- Makes you look....

31
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,619
...Old and fat. I know, I have heard.

32
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,582
- Where am I going, Lewis?
- Just around here, sir.

33
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:28,247
What did the coroner say?
He's still here, wading through it all.

34
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,723
Wading through it all?

35
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:32,863
- You need gloves, sir?
- Yeah. Give them to me.

36
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:38,127
That's a bedroom
round to your left.

37
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,391
- What was the murder weapon?
- That's just it.

38
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,934
What?

39
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,435
There wasn't one.

40
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:54,951
Nice, nice. Come on, get that.

41
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,208
Sorry, coach.

42
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,076
You're not concentrating, Jill.

43
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,615
You can make 24 seconds.
We both know you can.

44
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,151
Just focus on something
in the distance, and then--

45
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:36,153
Run for it like nothing else exists.

46
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:36,873
Right.

47
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,219
Okay. Good practice, ladies.
Hit the showers.

48
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,930
- Hey, Jill.
- Hey, Boom Boom.

49
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:06,374
I am sorry, your service
has been temporarily interrupted.

50
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:11,107
If this is an emergency,
please dial 911.

51
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,982
Jill.

52
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,585
Come on, Jill.
You just going to ignore me forever?

53
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:22,019
Sounds good to me.

54
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,183
I tried to call you last night,
but your cell phone was tweaked.

55
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,625
- We need to talk.
- Bobby, we have talked.

56
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,890
Seventy-four minutes yesterday,
124 the day before...

57
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,397
...and 256 the day before that.

58
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:36,229
- Just hear me out.
- I saw you with her.

59
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,995
Well, what else is there to discuss?

60
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,837
She kissed me.
I keep telling you that.

61
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:46,171
- I barely even remember it, anyway.
- Wait, so you let her kiss you.

62
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,577
- Please....
- Later, Bobby.

63
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,237
Am I going to see you tonight?

64
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,316
- Did you hang tough?
- I hung.

65
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,083
I don't want you
giving in to those blue eyes.

66
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,352
I am not going to give in.

67
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,798
You know, that's just the worst lion
I have ever seen, I got to tell you.

68
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,332
It's.... I know.

69
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:22,270
So, what time are you
picking us up tonight?

70
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,997
I am not picking anyone up.

71
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:26,441
- What do you mean?
- I am grounded.

72
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,507
All because you went over
your minutes?

73
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,577
- Yep. Thanks to that jerk.
- I thought they were going to wait...

74
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,111
...till after the bonfire.
So did l.

75
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,542
Hey, guys.

76
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:48,019
- Guys, this is so high school.
- Scarlet, we're in high school.

77
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,827
Anyway, they're making me
pay it off.

78
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:02,661
- Yeah, I have to babysit. Tonight.
- Tonight?

79
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,969
Who needs some
stupid bonfire party, anyway?

80
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:13,803
It's just a bunch of skanks and jerks
acting like idiots, right?

81
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:45,130
So Mom was able to get the tickets.

82
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:48,771
I was kind of hoping
they'd be sold-out.

83
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:51,970
Just be glad you're not going.

84
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,869
It's baroque chamber music.

85
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,408
Since the concert isn't over
until after midnight...

86
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,774
...Dr. Mandrakis will
drive you home, okay?

87
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,744
I could have at least
driven myself, Dad.

88
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,713
Jill, you went over by 800 minutes.

89
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,945
Do you know how much that cost us?

90
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,012
At least you could wait until after 8:00.
I know.

91
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:16,858
- I always do.
- Except this time you didn't.

92
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,516
That's-- That's not fair, Dad.
You know why.

93
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,389
Sweetheart, I know. But still....

94
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:27,295
Wha--? So if I drove myself, you think
I'd have just bailed and not shown up?

95
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:31,762
It's one month, Jill.
No phone, no car.

96
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:36,367
Besides, I don't want you driving
home alone this far so late at night.

97
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,911
Boy...

98
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:56,543
...they really live pretty far out here.
Yep.

99
00:10:56,543 --> 00:11:00,522
You going to be okay out here alone?
Depends what they have TiVo-ed.

100
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:09,497
Guess I should have been a doctor.

101
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,004
Just think of this
as learning responsibility.

102
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,911
Dad, I am responsible.

103
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:35,313
I mean, when it's not easy...

104
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:40,183
...when it's complicated,
when it hurts. That's when it counts.

105
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,949
Call us if you need anything.

106
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,706
- You guys have fun.
- Say it like you mean it.

107
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,560
Hi, I am the babysitter.

108
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,167
Oh, right, yes. Come in.

109
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,864
I am sorry to rush,
but I think we're a little late.

110
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,064
Honey, have you seen the keys?

111
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,976
Don't yell.
I just got the kids to sleep.

112
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,974
- Did you check the kitchen?
- Yeah.

113
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:55,245
Well, try the office.

114
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,149
You must be Jill.
I am Kelly Mandrakis.

115
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,876
Nice to meet you both.

116
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:05,987
We were so thrilled to find
a babysitter at the last minute.

117
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:08,487
You come highly recommended
by the Thompsons.

118
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,715
Well, they're great.

119
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:12,086
If you can handle them,
we're going to be a cakewalk.

120
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,054
Yeah.

121
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,923
- Tim, keys?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,923
Come on, I will show you around.

123
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,491
The kitchen's back here.

124
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:32,971
That's Chester.
He will probably be there all night.

125
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,609
It's beautiful.

126
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,918
Bye, Chester.

127
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,560
Oh, you will get used to that.

128
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,959
Here's a list of all the contact and
emergency numbers you might need.

129
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,065
Our cell numbers. And that's
the number of the restaurant.

130
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:08,225
Here's the phone. Don't hesitate
to call us about anything.

131
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,529
Oh, and help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

132
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,196
I remember babysitting.
Food's the best part.

133
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,940
Oh, and if you hear any banging
around upstairs, don't worry.

134
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,515
That's our live-in Rosa.
She has a room on the third floor.

135
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,150
She sometimes leaves
to go take care of her mother...

136
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,047
...who's been pretty sick recently.

137
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,585
- Your house is amazing.
- Thank you.

138
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,950
Tim, have you seen my--?

139
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,091
Okay.
Anything else, or are we done?

140
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:41,420
- The guesthouse?
- Guesthouse.

141
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,495
Our son, who's in college,
stays out there most weekends.

142
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:48,690
Not that he ever calls
to let us know when he's coming.

143
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,334
You have a son in college?

144
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,935
From my first marriage.

145
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,038
Our dinner reservations
are at 8...

146
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,503
...but we might catch
a movie afterwards...

147
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,234
...which would put us home
around midnight. Is that okay?

148
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,467
- That's fine.
- Great.

149
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,100
- Okay. Anything else? All set?
- The children?

150
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,274
First bedroom
at the top of the landing.

151
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,745
They're getting over the flu.

152
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,474
We had a hard time
getting them to sleep...

153
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:15,415
...so whatever you do,
please, try not to wake them.

154
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,450
Oh, we have an alarm system.

155
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:23,154
I will write the code
down for you right here.

156
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:26,088
- You familiar with these?
- Yes.

157
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,721
Okay, honey, let's go.

158
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:30,698
Bye.

159
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,362
- Just make yourself at home.
- Okay.

160
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:17,404
Oh, thank you. I just bought them.

161
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,680
Hello?

162
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,180
Dr. Mandrakis?

163
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:35,756
Rosa?

164
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,803
Rosa?

165
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,372
Rosa?

166
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,548
Rosa, this is Jill the babysitter.

167
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:57,481
Hello.

168
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:30,817
Hello.

169
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,990
Mandrakis residence.

170
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:49,367
Hello?

171
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:13,793
Chester.

172
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,164
What are the kids like?

173
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,434
I don't know.
They were asleep when I got here.

174
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,201
And the house?

175
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,005
Pretty amazing.

176
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:36,082
You should see her closet.
It's bigger than my room.

177
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:37,477
Food?

178
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,049
I haven't checked that out yet.

179
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,051
Good closet means good supplies.

180
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:45,155
Listen, I am not sure if I should
tell you this, but--

181
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:47,188
What?

182
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,654
The jerk called me.

183
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,350
He wants your number over there.

184
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,858
Well, did you give it to him?

185
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,826
No, because he'd call.

186
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,226
It's okay to give it to him.

187
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:59,026
I am smelling weakness.

188
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:01,600
I am not being weak.

189
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,065
Then why talk to him?

190
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:05,636
So I can just end this thing
once and for all.

191
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,432
Well, that sounds convincing.

192
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,065
Come on, I got it.

193
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:15,042
The person you really should
be talking to is Tiffany.

194
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,314
When are you heading
over to the bonfire?

195
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:22,747
Nice subject change.
I am on my way now.

196
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:25,579
I want to get a good seat before
the jocks start streaking...

197
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:27,721
...Iike a pack of wild idiots.

198
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,982
Now you're really
making me sad I am missing it.

199
00:25:30,982 --> 00:25:33,023
You want me to swing by first?

200
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,489
No, it's okay.

201
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:37,894
But give Bobby the number, all right?

202
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:42,800
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Fine, I have been warned.

203
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,223
- Hello.
- This is TTR Protection.

204
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:20,760
We just registered your alarm.

205
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,090
Is there an emergency,
or do you need assistance?

206
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,391
No, not at all.
I am just the babysitter.

207
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,761
I think the maid set off the alarm.

208
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,459
May I have the password please?

209
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,605
Password? I only have a number.

210
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,972
I will have to check with the 
Mandrakises to confirm your identity.

211
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:39,507
- What is your name?
- Jill Johnson.

212
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,619
Okay, Miss Johnson,
Mrs. Mandrakis confirmed.

213
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,415
- Good night.
- Thank you.

214
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:06,851
Hello.

215
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,027
Hello, is somebody there?

216
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:15,270
Is everything okay? We just got
a call from the alarm company.

217
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,667
Everything's fine.
The alarm just went off.

218
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,330
I don't know how many times I have
written the number down for Rosa.

219
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,408
- Did it wake the kids?
- I don't think so.

220
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,806
They're still quiet.
Do you want me to go check?

221
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:28,413
No, no. Trust me, you'd know
if they were awake.

222
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,481
Okay. Well, good.
Call if you need anything else.

223
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,050
Okay. Thank you.

224
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:41,584
Rosa.

225
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:44,385
Is everything okay?

226
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,217
Rosa.

227
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,587
Are you still here?

228
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,358
Hello.

229
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,431
Mandrakis residence.

230
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:50,940
Is everything okay?

231
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,479
Dr. Mandrakis?

232
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:01,925
Hello.

233
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,295
- Hello.
- Hey.

234
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,396
- Who is this?
- What are you wearing?

235
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:15,564
Combat boots and a parka, you jerk. 
Who is this?

236
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:19,438
Bobby, is this you?

237
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:23,711
Whoever this is, this isn't funny.

238
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,815
Yeah, it is.

239
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,975
Assholes.

240
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,140
Hello.

241
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:07,673
Hello.

242
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:14,180
My God, the look on your face.
What the hell are you doing here?

243
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:18,086
Oh, my God. 
Could this house be more awesome?

244
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:21,094
Tiffany, you don't just do this
to people. Why didn't you call?

245
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:22,730
I just did.

246
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,324
- How did you get in?
- The garage door is open.

247
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,530
What?

248
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,301
What's the big deal?

249
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,282
I have been getting really weird
prank phone calls all night.

250
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:49,679
So then don't answer the phone.
I am sure they have voice mail.

251
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,184
- Well, maybe I am expecting a call.
- From Bobby?

252
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:55,755
- What's it to you?
- Oh, I don't know.

253
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:58,254
Maybe because I am your best friend.

254
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:03,019
It's a little hard to remember
after what you did.

255
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:12,196
How many times do I have to say
that I am sorry? It was one kiss.

256
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:15,098
And besides,
you know what tequila does to me.

257
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:16,499
Then don't drink.

258
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,474
- Fine, I will try.
- Face it, Tiffany...

259
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:22,166
...you have been crushing
on Bobby ever since ninth grade.

260
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:23,670
Yeah, I have.

261
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,744
It's because he asked me out first.
I was with him for one day...

262
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:28,642
...when he spotted you.

263
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:33,080
I never got my kiss, so I figured
I had it coming to me.

264
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:35,852
Now we're even.

265
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,954
You know what? That's the lamest
excuse I have ever heard.

266
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:41,113
Jill, I am a bitch.

267
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:45,587
I know that, you know that,
everybody knows that.

268
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:49,220
Let's go do a truce shot.

269
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:53,122
- I bet they have a killer bar.
- You're quitting, remember?

270
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:56,463
Sherry, port. 
So, what about something real, people?

271
00:35:56,463 --> 00:36:00,003
Voila. Tequila.

272
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,868
Didn't we just talk about
you not drinking, Tiffany?

273
00:36:04,343 --> 00:36:08,472
- You were serious?
- Okay. You got to go...

274
00:36:08,472 --> 00:36:10,772
...because I am babysitting.

275
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:12,881
Okay, fine.

276
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,778
But at least come with me to
the bonfire, just for a couple of hours.

277
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,578
I mean, the kids are asleep, right?

278
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:23,189
So you could just set the alarm
and no one would ever know.

279
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,355
Kidding.

280
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:29,823
Bye.
Bye.

281
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:32,487
Call me.

282
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,747
Shit. Oh, shit.

283
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,005
Oh, God.

284
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,777
Oh, no. Come on.

285
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:20,856
Tiffany. Tiffany, come on.

286
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,292
This isn't funny.

287
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,464
Tiffany?

288
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:06,353
Hello.

289
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,729
Mandrakis residence.

290
00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:14,593
- Jill, is that you?
- Bobby. Bobby, are you there?

291
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,428
Wait, move around.
We have got a bad connection.

292
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,762
- Jill.
- Yeah, it's me.

293
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:23,668
Listen, have you been calling me?

294
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:25,638
Hold on.

295
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:29,539
- Can you hear me? Is that better?
- Yeah, it's better. Listen--

296
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,838
- No one can get a signal up here.
- Bobby, listen.

297
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,346
- Have you been calling me here?
- What?

298
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:37,176
I won't get mad. I just need to know
if you have been calling.

299
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:41,084
Well, Cody pranked you,
but I made him stop.

300
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:43,153
- Just once?
- Yeah, I think so.

301
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:46,688
Bobby, listen, this is very important.
I won't get mad.

302
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:48,758
Has he called me more than once?

303
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,325
I don't know.

304
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,587
Hold on, let me check.

305
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:56,927
Hey, Cody.

306
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,990
Bobby?

307
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:03,226
Are you still there?

308
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:12,040
The person you are trying
to reach is out of range.

309
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,576
Please try your call again....

310
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,367
Tiffany, I know it's you.

311
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,637
I can see your name
on caller lD, genius.

312
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,201
This isn't Tiffany.

313
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,777
Who is this?

314
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:03,114
Who is this?

315
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,716
Cody?

316
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,247
Who's Cody?

317
00:42:10,622 --> 00:42:12,955
You better cut this out.

318
00:42:57,692 --> 00:42:59,283
Hello.

319
00:42:59,283 --> 00:43:02,189
- Hello.
- Scarlet, it's me, Jill.

320
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:04,589
- Jill.
- Can you hear me?

321
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:07,960
Barely. 
No one can get any service up here.

322
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,464
Yeah, I know. Listen....

323
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,431
Did Tiffany come up to talk to you?
Yeah, she came by.

324
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:15,634
Did you kiss and make up?

325
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:17,237
Jill?

326
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:19,307
Scarlet--
Are you there?

327
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:27,007
The person you are trying to reach
is out of range.

328
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:29,671
Please try your call....

329
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:41,114
Hello, you have reached Ben Johnson.

330
00:43:41,114 --> 00:43:44,522
Sorry I missed your call. 
Please leave a message after the beep.

331
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:46,448
Dad...

332
00:43:47,997 --> 00:43:51,762
...it's Jill here. Can you call me at the
Mandrakises' when you have a chance?

333
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,161
Okay? Thanks.

334
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,439
Please leave me a detailed message...

335
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:12,343
...and I will return your call
as soon as I can. Have a great day.

336
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:14,642
Hi, Mrs. Mandrakis.
It's me, Jill, calling.

337
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:17,445
Could you give me a call
when you get a chance?

338
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:22,112
But don't-- Don't worry,
everything's fine. Okay, thank you.

339
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:34,658
IL Cielo, how may I help you?

340
00:44:34,658 --> 00:44:37,461
Hi. 
Can I speak with Dr. Mandrakis, please?

341
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:41,593
Dr. Mandrakis?
He left about 40 minutes ago.

342
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:44,603
That's what I thought.
Okay, thank you.

343
00:44:52,146 --> 00:44:54,272
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

344
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:56,142
Can I speak with the police?

345
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:58,783
- Is this an emergency?
- Yes.

346
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:01,477
No. No, not really.

347
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:05,679
Would you like me to connect you?
Yes, please. Thank you.

348
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,484
Elan Valley Police Department,
Officer Burroughs.

349
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:13,923
How can I help you?
I have been getting weird phone calls...

350
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:17,064
...about every 15 minutes from a man.
It's starting to scare me.

351
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:20,200
An anonymous caller, miss?
Yes.

352
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,301
- Has he threatened you?
- No.

353
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:24,061
Has he been using obscene language?

354
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,137
No. 
Sometimes he doesn't even say anything.

355
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:29,740
- He just keeps on calling.
- There's not much we can do...

356
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,899
...unless there's a real threat.

357
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:35,675
Is the phone listed in your name?
No, I am just the babysitter.

358
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:38,211
- What's your name?
- Jill Johnson.

359
00:45:38,211 --> 00:45:40,905
Do you have friends that can
come over, keep you company?

360
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:44,315
No, they're all at the bonfire.
My school's having...

361
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:46,009
...this big thing by the....

362
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,951
I know. 
We have a couple units over there.

363
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:51,317
Sounds pretty wild.

364
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,992
- Rosa's car.
- What's that?

365
00:45:55,992 --> 00:46:00,325
The housekeeper. I thought she left,
but I-- I guess she hasn't.

366
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,966
There you go. You feel better
with the two of you there?

367
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,691
Actually, I feel pretty stupid.

368
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:07,427
There's a lot of freaks out there.
You were right to call.

369
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:09,434
If you need anything else,
just call back.

370
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,868
I am here all night.
Just ask for Officer Burroughs.

371
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,031
- Officer Burroughs.
- Take care, miss.

372
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,766
Thank you.

373
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,351
Rosa?

374
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:36,020
Rosa.

375
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:06,776
Rosa?

376
00:47:08,217 --> 00:47:09,548
Are you down there?

377
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:13,379
Hello, this is Rosa.
Please, leave a message.

378
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,207
Hello, this is Rosa.
Please, leave a....

379
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:19,248
- Hello.
- Have you checked the children?

380
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,898
- Hello.
- How were the children?

381
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:54,431
Elan Valley Police.

382
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:56,729
- He can see me.
- I am sorry.

383
00:51:56,729 --> 00:52:00,304
It's Jill, the girl who called before
about the man who can....

384
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:03,100
- Tell me what's going on.
- He called me again.

385
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,676
What did he say?
He's out there. He's outside. He's--

386
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:08,779
He's watching me through the windows.

387
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:11,380
Did you see him?
No, but I know he can see me.

388
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,074
He knew when I went upstairs.
Okay. Take a deep breath.

389
00:52:14,074 --> 00:52:16,184
Where's the housekeeper?
I-- I don't know.

390
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:18,319
I-- I-- I saw her purse and the keys...

391
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,114
...but I-- I can't find her.
Is the house locked up?

392
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:23,688
- Yes.
- Alarm system?

393
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:25,654
- It's on.
- Okay.

394
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:28,556
You're safe inside that house.
If he wanted to break in...

395
00:52:28,556 --> 00:52:32,527
...he wouldn't be calling you.
But he must want something.

396
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:33,960
Listen to me.

397
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,158
Miss, he's just some asshole
trying to hassle you.

398
00:52:37,158 --> 00:52:40,030
There's something we can do.
What?

399
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,434
I can alert the phone company,
so when he calls...

400
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:44,232
...we can try and trace the call.

401
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:46,841
I can also get my commander
to authorize a GPS trace...

402
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:48,805
...if he's calling from a cell phone.

403
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:52,276
Now, I got your number here.
Can you verify the address?

404
00:52:52,276 --> 00:52:54,641
I don't....

405
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:58,145
I don't know.
My dad brought me here. I....

406
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:05,816
It's-- Wait.
Here. 3378 Old Mill Road.

407
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,322
I know where that is.
Now, if he calls again...

408
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:10,619
...try to keep him on the line
for 60 seconds...

409
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,522
...so we can trace the call.
I can't do that.

410
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,220
He doesn't stay on the phone
for more than a few seconds.

411
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,194
I will see if 
I can get a car out to you.

412
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,993
But if I do, it's going to take at least
20 minutes from the time of dispatch.

413
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,566
Think you will be okay until then?

414
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:28,370
Yes.
Good.

415
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:31,532
Now, I will be watching the phone line.
Call me if you need to.

416
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:34,542
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,899
Hello.

418
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,612
It's you, isn't it?

419
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:24,514
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Wait, don't hang up.

420
00:54:28,987 --> 00:54:32,512
If you keep on calling,
must mean you want to talk, right?

421
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:44,863
Is it me you're calling for?

422
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:49,731
Are you calling for the Mandrakises?

423
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,699
Damn it.

424
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:04,713
Guesthouse.

425
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,924
Hey, it's Todd. I am not here.
I am up at school.

426
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:27,962
And if you don't have the number,
then there's probably a reason.

427
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:32,165
Hi, it's Jill, the babysitter.

428
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:35,792
If you or Rosa are in there,
could you please pick up...

429
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:38,337
...or come up to the house?

430
00:55:38,337 --> 00:55:42,703
Someone's been calling,
and I called the police.

431
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:47,839
I was wondering if you could come up
and wait here with me until they come.

432
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:38,863
Todd?

433
00:57:40,934 --> 00:57:42,491
Hello?

434
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,135
Todd.

435
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,770
Hey, it's Todd. I am not here.
I am up at school.

436
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:35,704
And if you don't have the number,
then there's probably a reason.

437
00:58:47,885 --> 00:58:49,875
It's you, isn't it?

438
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,985
How did you get this number?

439
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,285
How do you know I am in here?

440
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,788
Did you see me out there?

441
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:05,191
Why are you doing this to me?

442
00:59:11,703 --> 00:59:15,433
Sixty seconds. Got you.

443
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:37,521
You called the wrong phone line.

444
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:02,440
Rosa.

445
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,832
Rosa?

446
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:30,070
It's Jill.

447
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,186
Hello.

448
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:55,253
I know it's you.

449
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:08,130
I am not going to be here much longer.

450
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,296
Dr. Mandrakis and his wife
are coming home soon.

451
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:24,546
Why won't you answer me?

452
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:31,187
I know you're there.
I can-- I can hear you breathing.

453
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,469
Is that what you wanted?

454
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:06,740
To scare me?

455
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:11,516
Because if that's what you want,
you can stop now...

456
01:03:11,516 --> 01:03:14,018
...because it really worked.

457
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:31,731
But you don't know who I am,
or where I live.

458
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:34,592
And Dr. Mandrakis is going to
take me home...

459
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:36,095
...as soon as he gets here.

460
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:39,803
But maybe even the police
will take me home.

461
01:03:55,686 --> 01:04:00,816
Please, I mean, there has to be
a reason why you keep on calling me.

462
01:04:03,627 --> 01:04:04,615
I mean...

463
01:04:04,828 --> 01:04:09,161
...if you're not trying to scare me,
what do you want?

464
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:11,160
Your blood...

465
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,231
...all over me.

466
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:35,443
Rosa?

467
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:07,600
Stop calling me, you sick....
Jill? Listen to me.

468
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,300
We traced the call.
It's coming from inside the house.

469
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,173
Do you hear me?
It's coming from inside the house.

470
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:19,879
You need to get out of there
right now. Jill?

471
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,290
Oh, my God.

472
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:03,456
Come on. Okay.

473
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,030
Come on. Okay.

474
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:19,045
Kids, come on.

475
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:18,459
I am Jill, the babysitter.

476
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:27,501
Here. Stay right here. Stay-- 
Stay here.

477
01:10:05,136 --> 01:10:07,865
Get out.
Go out that window right there.

478
01:10:50,237 --> 01:10:50,987
No.

479
01:10:52,105 --> 01:10:54,197
Please, no.

480
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:02,116
Get away. Go on.

481
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:02,994
Come back.

482
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,524
Come back.

483
01:15:32,953 --> 01:15:34,715
Kids.

484
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:38,347
It's Jill.

485
01:15:40,226 --> 01:15:42,124
Where are you?

486
01:15:42,794 --> 01:15:45,590
Come on. Come on.

487
01:15:46,396 --> 01:15:47,864
Come on.

488
01:15:47,864 --> 01:15:49,658
Please.

489
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:52,960
Come on. Oh, God.

490
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,999
Kids.

491
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:00,100
Come on.

492
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,209
There. Are you guys okay?

493
01:16:53,582 --> 01:16:56,948
Kids, come on. You okay?
Come on. Got to go.

494
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:01,112
Come on, got to go, got to go.

495
01:17:02,055 --> 01:17:03,578
Come on.

496
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:48,465
Jill. Jill, it's okay. You're safe.
Stop it. No.

497
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:06,414
How you doing?

498
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:12,743
- Where is he?
- We have got him.

499
01:19:13,121 --> 01:19:15,021
He's in that police car
right over there.

500
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:16,656
In ankle cuffs, handcuffs.

501
01:19:17,259 --> 01:19:20,625
Enough sedatives to kill a horse.
We're going to take him to the hospital.

502
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:23,421
We will have four cops
guarding him around the clock.

503
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:27,860
That's not enough.

504
01:19:33,303 --> 01:19:35,134
Take care, Jill.

505
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:33,913
....reporting to you from Elan Valley...

506
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,510
...where police have just apprehended 
a suspect....

507
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:38,516
....wanted in the murders of 15 people here.

508
01:20:38,516 --> 01:20:39,677
....in Colarodo.....

509
01:20:39,677 --> 01:20:42,749
....He say he's linked to a 
series of murders where young women...

510
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:44,453
...were stalked and harassed for hours...

511
01:20:44,453 --> 01:20:46,516
...an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse.

512
01:20:46,516 --> 01:20:50,351
Police are looking for links between
victims. They were young women....

513
01:20:50,351 --> 01:20:53,799
....most recent victim was in
Buord County, 125 miles west....

514
01:20:53,799 --> 01:20:54,997
....Elan Valley.

515
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:58,261
As of now, his identity remains a mystery.

516
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:18,169
Oh, my God. No. No.

517
01:23:18,169 --> 01:23:21,778
He's in the house. He's in the house.
Look-- Look, listen to me.

518
