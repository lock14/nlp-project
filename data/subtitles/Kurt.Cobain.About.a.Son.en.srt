Made by Neo666

3
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,530
I never wanted us
was' mystery 'on us.

4
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,531
It 'just that I had nothing
to say, at the beginning.

5
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,965
But now, after all this
time, c '? just a story.

6
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:02,701
Yet, every night I think
that my life is so? boring.

7
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:08,344
I know what? Many people ... not
deserve to have a book written about us.

8
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:13,167
I know I have to talk about
details of my life.

9
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:16,140
You know, I like to talk
with you ... but ...

10
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:25,590
... I do not think that will be the most open with
you about my personal life.

11
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:28,421
Why? People do not
deserve to know ...

12
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:31,316
You do the cocks ...

13
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:34,246
... about my life
private now.

14
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:37,047
Vadano to fanculo!

15
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,548
They must not know
ALL about me.

16
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,817
I have always wanted to think
I was an alien.

17
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:27,734
When I thought little of
have been adopted by my mother, ...

18
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,348
because ...? I had found
when a spaceship ...

19
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,634
... I was sent down by a
different planet. I wanted so much.

20
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:42,468
Every night I spoke with the
My real family in heaven.

21
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:48,565
I knew that there were thousands more
cascati children of aliens on Earth.

22
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:52,480
And they are everywhere.
I know different.

23
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:57,573
I have always thought about this thing.
It was fun to imagine.

24
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:00,252
I am not here for a few
special reason ...

25
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,856
... and I always longing for home.

26
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:05,657
And 'the same for the other aliens.

27
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,893
I have known only
a handful ...

28
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,348
... during my life ...

29
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:15,707
... and one day discover
cos'? that we have to do.

30
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,580
Until all'et? Had for 8 years
had a childhood very happy.

31
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,474
Really good, with
a mother affectionate E. ..

32
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,548
... I have always driven to make art.

33
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:14,381
Disegnavo, read and
she encouraged me.

34
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:17,977
I enjoyed it a lot ...
a childhood truly excellent.

35
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,442
I had everything under control
and I knew what I did.

36
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:22,895
Nothing could stop.

37
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:27,584
I knew they can do what
I wanted to perch? world was small ...

38
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:31,047
... and the things I was prostravano
Fortunately front ...

39
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:36,753
... and I did not have n? problems
n? obstacles, at that time.

40
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,135
I have never been
a 'bad boy' ...

41
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,927
but I did things ...
... ...

42
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:49,195
... pull cans full of
stones at cars.

43
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:51,262
And I was fixed with the cops.

44
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:56,861
I said "corn on the cops."
The cops arrive and kill you.

45
00:06:56,862 --> 00:07:00,448
As I saw a flying saucer
tiravo the cans.

46
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,243
And as I saw a sbirro
the cantavo those words ...

47
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:07,992
... and the indicavo saying
that it was' evil '.

48
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,540
My aunt Mary ...

49
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,682
... a sort of aspiring musician ...

50
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,843
... played in various groups in Aberdeen Bar ...

51
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:19,508
... and you? been the person I
has helped the most by far ...

52
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,192
... with regard to the music ...

53
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:25,997
because ...? me regal? a guitar
electricity when I was 8 years ...

54
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:29,226
... and I was her to give me the Beatles discs.

55
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:32,297
And I said a bass drum ...

56
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:37,315
... and me agganciavo and giravo
with the Elmer Fudd hat ...

57
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,554
... and the shoes of my father.

58
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:45,191
And giravo for the neighbourhood beating
on the drum and singing the Beatles.

59
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:49,363
When very most young I was sure
to become a rock-star.

60
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:52,413
There were no problems,
perch? cos I was? hyperactive e. ..

61
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,546
... the world was in my hands.
I could do everything.

62
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:57,489
I could become President,
if I wanted.

63
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,048
But it was stupid idea.

64
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,620
Better to be a rock-star.

65
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:05,375
I do not understand my environment,
What I attendesse.

66
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:09,069
The alienation that I would have
tried by teenager ...

67
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,711
because ...? saw as Aberdeen
any other town of America.

68
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:13,941
I thought they were all equal.

69
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:21,398
All agree, and without the
instead there was violence.

70
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,545
It would have been easy ...

71
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:27,071
... and I believed that the U.S. had
not most of my large garden.

72
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,132
Then there would be
been problems ...

73
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,933
... to turn the whole country
playing in a group ...

74
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,786
... and appear on
covers of magazines.

75
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:38,285
I had an early preparation ...

76
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:42,939
... but when I started to have
depressive attacks to 9 years ...

77
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:46,224
... I stopped to see her in that way.

78
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:58,479
I think that my generation
is the last generation innocent.

79
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:04,009
The TV was not violent,
there was the 'cable'.

80
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,497
We had 'Sesame Street',
'Speed Racer' is stuff here, and go on.

81
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,704
Everything was imaginary.

82
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:16,991
Everything was ... basic medieval ...
compared with today.

83
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:22,620
Children are required to be pi?
ahead of what are really.

84
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,969
Venivo always sculacciato.

85
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:32,344
My father ... species outside ... the restaurant ...
if versavo something by mistake ...

86
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:37,664
... I was running his head between the knuckles ...
or gave me a slap.

87
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,397
I have never managed to understand how ...

88
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:43,509
... a parent could be
cos? imbrazzato ...

89
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:47,570
... what? intimidated by what could
others think about you in a restaurant ...

90
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:50,375
... just because? your son has
overthrew something by mistake ...

91
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,752
... as for having to punish the accident.

92
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:56,845
It 'a bad joke psychological
to play a child ...

93
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:03,710
... because ... still inside affondo
me if something other side.

94
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,285
I arrabbio much with myself.

95
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:10,047
Why? Have been preconditioned
not to commit human error.

96
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,507
Everything must always be perfect.

97
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:15,607
Go to fanculo for this.

98
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,227
His work in practice was run
all day to count trunks.

99
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:36,987
His idea of activity? Father-son was
bring to work Saturday and Sunday ...

100
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:41,425
... and I restavo sitting in his office
while he was out to count trunks.

101
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,821
Bel weekend exciting!

102
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,638
I did and disegnavo
jokes telephone.

103
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:56,831
Then I went in the store where
were stacked the 2x4.

104
00:10:56,832 --> 00:11:01,994
They were very high and there
I played in 'guards and thieves' ...

105
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,752
... or was pretending to be
Superman or other super-heroes.

106
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,008
That was the highest
fun as possible.

107
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,258
Then slept a little 'in van
listening to the disc of Queen ...

108
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,261
... "News of the world" and repeating
scaricavo battery of the van.

109
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:50,966
Capitava often remain on foot
perch? too had heard the Queen.

110
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,883
I do not feel that they have
had a true father.

111
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:38,665
I never had a father figure
with whom to share things.

112
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,182
It 'hard to keep memories
the first of 7 years ...

113
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,027
... and that was the time
where I lived with him ...

114
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:48,240
... and it was my pap? ..
I had a mother and a father ...

115
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:52,991
... and after I lived with
him for a short period ...

116
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:56,550
... dopodich? si? married
and I have become ...

117
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:01,612
... one of the things less
important on his list.

118
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:09,290
If I were in that situation
with Courtney and Frances ...

119
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:14,109
... I will do all for my whole life,
to stay in touch with Frances ...

120
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,122
... and maintain relations with you ...

121
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:17,543
... and share things with you ...

122
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:19,703
... him? only surrendered.

123
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:35,099
I just want him to know that
I did not pi? nothing against him.

124
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:41,124
I do not want to talk perch? Not
I have nothing to share with him.

125
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:48,058
I am sure that the sconvolgerei,
but things are so?

126
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,392
All my peers are interrogarono
at the same time:

127
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:59,470
"When the cock divorce
my parents? What happens? ...

128
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,931
... are the divorziando
parents of all my friends "

129
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,967
"Something does not go."

130
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,142
For some reason, the way in which
our parents have grown ...

131
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,633
... is not the right way.

132
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,486
They scazzato,
in some way.

133
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,844
They lived in a
imaginary world ...

134
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,520
... then must have
something wrong.

135
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:18,243
They divorced, had to deny the
oaths, as did my mother ...

136
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:20,937
... had to start
to drink in 30 years.

137
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:28,354
And, confused, have ended up scazzare
in educating their children adolescents ...

138
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,515
because ...? not have
understand what they need.

139
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,575
All my friends are
put this question ...

140
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,076
... when they were 7 years ...

141
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:38,792
... and is not the Children for
ask these things.

142
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:46,192
But ... was like a
scourge ... a disease.

143
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,998
My story? Equal to 90%
people of my et?

144
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:34,091
Same problems. They
made the canes to school ...

145
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:38,896
They are grown in the years
the 'Communist threat' ...

146
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,657
... and all thought that we would
deaths in a nuclear war ...

147
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:46,168
... and there was always the most violence
in our society? ..

148
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,850
... and the reaction? equal for all.

149
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,016
I do not believe that our
version 'music' for us? ..

150
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:59,713
... is different from those of the other
groups emerged in the same years.

151
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,925
I do not believe that
we are most 'special' ...

152
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,118
... in having suffered the same damage.
E 'equal.

153
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,807
But we received more interest
perch? our songs are orecchiabili ...

154
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,989
... and remain in the headlines of the people.

155
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,085
In gymnastics, third in average,
I was jumping with the rope ...

156
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,953
... and suddenly I
ceded his back ...

157
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,167
... and I had to
go to the hospital ...

158
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:28,102
because ...? not respiravo
and seemed to be broken.

159
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:29,757
It was un'ernia disk ...

160
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:32,824
... and went from chiropractor ...

161
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,422
... and discovered to have scoleosi.

162
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,738
I should have worn a
bust, but I did not want ...

163
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,374
... and it emerged that playing
guitar had contributed ...

164
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,946
... to increasing scoleosi.

165
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:50,497
He had done bending
of pi? his back ...

166
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:55,173
because ...? weight of the guitar
weighed on my left shoulder.

167
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:58,904
What? Yet
most warped.

168
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:03,576
I have always had
a pain.

169
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,699
Not me have never
imagined.

170
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,370
Provavo a pain
constant.

171
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,455
Probably in my head ...

172
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:13,250
... I bartered the pain
back to the stomach.

173
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,064
Once started stomach pain,
were cos? so most acute ...

174
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:18,915
... I did not pi? thought to
my back for a long time.

175
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:25,714
I have always believed to have
schizophrenic tendencies ...

176
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:28,570
because ...? I was always
cos? nervous ...

177
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,398
I had all these nervous habits.

178
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:35,378
There were riots
compulsive that I had.

179
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:38,305
Scrocchiarmi fingers,
grattarmi the face,

180
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:42,880
toccarmi hair,
I had the all.

181
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,796
It was a mixture of my
hatred towards people ...

182
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:52,153
because ...? did not meet
my expectations ...

183
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,601
... and of being fed to attend
always the same idiots.

184
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:59,420
Each copy
Exact other.

185
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,823
I read in my face
they do not sopportavo.

186
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,792
It was a personal vendetta,
perch? were cos? 'macho' ...

187
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:13,132
... and male ...
and stupid ...

188
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:18,329
I started to realize
that people notavano ...

189
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,517
... my hatred
a lot of people ...

190
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,304
... and my acquaintances took for
granted that not sopportassi ...

191
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:31,210
... and I was always irritable ...

192
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:35,450
... and then I started to feel ...
really ... neurotic ...

193
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,820
... paranoid ...

194
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:41,103
because ...? knew that I could
erupt at any time.

195
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:48,137
I was seen as the boy who would
probably brought an AK-47 at school ...

196
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,200
... and would have done outside all.

197
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:04,017
Would it not have been strange ...

198
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,228
... if I had found at least one
boy with her hair extravagant.

199
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:12,049
There was also
A punk-rocker!

200
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:18,746
I wanted to 'feel part',
but not the average for teachers.

201
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:22,251
Not with the boy pi?
People of the school.

202
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:27,158
I wanted to be with strambi,
but they were 'sub-strambi'.

203
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:32,726
For Aberdeen, there were ...
strambi ... in the media.

204
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:38,645
There were the alternative, were
simply 'deformed'.

205
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:14,469
Fortunately I found
a gay friend ...

206
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,592
... I imped? if you would
kill all the time.

207
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:22,067
It seems all
knew was gay ...

208
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:25,618
... but nobody told me ...
or not I realized ...

209
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,299
until ...? there prov?
with me, one evening ....

210
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,746
... and I said to him the theatrical
that I was not gay ...

211
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:35,546
... but that would be remained
his friend.

212
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:39,857
After I realized that
I watched people ...

213
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:44,295
... so yet
most bizarre than usual.

214
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:49,856
Then they started
bersagliarmi to ...

215
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,993
some boys ...
Gymnastics species.

216
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:57,027
It felt threatened,
perch? were naked ...

217
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:58,770
... and I, for them, I was gay.

218
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:03,735
Then or covered
penalties or beat me.

219
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,177
Or both.

220
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:11,609
But after I started to feel
proud to be gay ...

221
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:13,036
... although less.

222
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,115
I liked the conflict.

223
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,279
Exciting.

224
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,175
Why? I almost
found my identity?

225
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:25,774
I was a strambo
'special'.

226
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:29,668
Not really punk-rocker
I was looking for, but ...

227
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,420
... at least it was better to be
strambo an average.

228
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,278
Once my mother scopr?
I did the reeds ...

229
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,859
... and prov? various
psychological approaches ...

230
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,786
... for me to stop ...

231
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:59,189
... but took dell'erba
among the jewels ...

232
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,887
... and I sometimes furtively
it staccavo a small piece ...

233
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,619
... and the rimpiazzavo
with oregano.

234
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,967
Right? Who had a bag
of oregano between jewellery.

235
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:13,330
One evening invite? Me and my friend
Myer to fumarci a cane ...

236
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,034
... and you knew that it was oregano ...

237
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,417
... but we did not know
who knew ...

238
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:19,769
... then we tocc? stay
l? fumarci to the oregano.

239
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:26,289
But not fumavamo never together.

240
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:31,021
The only other memory
My mother and the reeds ...

241
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,495
... was when I was a parcel
of 'Hard Aberdeen Buds' ...

242
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,612
... scattered on the table ...

243
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,760
... and I sat with a festino
Myer and a couple of friends ...

244
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,697
... and we were making
games with alcohol and reeds ...

245
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:41,430
... type with a game 'bonghi' ...

246
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:44,319
... and you sal? about drunk
and odious ...

247
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,034
... and this had with
me, that evening.

248
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,719
Begin 'to
do fessa.

249
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,565
Sal? Up and I fiss? With
chilling look ...

250
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:55,839
... and stacc? a big
piece of grass and ingoi?

251
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,615
It was foreign-made ...

252
00:22:57,616 --> 00:22:59,766
-- "She has told me
that story ... "

253
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,058
What? Learn.

254
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,159
-- "Th?"

255
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:07,935
There was a teacher ...

256
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,854
... that students appreciated
with interesting stories.

257
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,014
He taught English ...

258
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:17,814
... and I wrote stories crazy,
often offensive ...

259
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,492
... and loved her.

260
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,446
I trattenenva
after the lesson ...

261
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:23,800
... and we talked for hours.

262
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,106
It was strong.

263
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:28,401
The only other prof. I
liked was to ...

264
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,492
... 'Artistic commercial'
in the first and fourth.

265
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,815
He had me
of great help.

266
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:35,930
I always utiliazzava
as an example ...

267
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:40,158
... and always sent my
works of art competitions ...

268
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,626
... in different states ...

269
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,602
... without telling me anything ...

270
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:44,716
... without my permission ...

271
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:48,084
... I liked that
type of competition ...

272
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:52,238
... and then it was behind my shoulders
and after I gave the awards I had won.

273
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:00,677
My family was sure that
I went to a school of art ...

274
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:04,512
... but at that time I was cos?
taken from Punk-rock ...

275
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:08,074
I wanted to play
in a group instead.

276
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:10,758
I had offered
two scholarships ...

277
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,738
... but I did not have any
intention to accept them.

278
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:17,480
I had decided
gi? years from the beginning.

279
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,901
-- "And what comport?
This, in the family? "

280
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,535
I have suffered
thrown out.

281
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:29,117
Not so perch? Did not want to study ...

282
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,751
... rather perch? I was not
doing nothing with my life.

283
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:34,278
I had ambitions ...

284
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,892
the second ...
My parents ...

285
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,292
... but I had.

286
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,257
I was immersed in music ...

287
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:44,407
... and trying desperately
to form a group.

288
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:48,083
They, for? not
saw as important.

289
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:54,032
Not just taken the guitar
it became so? obsessed ...

290
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:57,211
... and for me there fissai
cos? many years ...

291
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:00,335
... every day for
a few hours, in the evening ...

292
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:04,326
... before you sleep, the guitar
was the only thing did.

293
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:10,263
I wanted to make Punk-rock
for a long time ...

294
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:12,790
because ...? I was a subscriber
"Creem Magazine" ...

295
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,608
... then I
I was in the room ...

296
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,401
... to make pretend
Punk-rock sound ...

297
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:21,527
... or what I was
Punk-rock, guitar.

298
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,935
At the end? Similar.

299
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:28,468
It 'just noise. Noise
3 agreements made by ...

300
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:29,687
... and screams ...

301
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,666
I felt that the Punk-rock
could be this.

302
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:37,591
When I moved once
from Aberdeen to Montesano ...

303
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:39,724
... which is 30 Km
from Aberdeen ...

304
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,647
... a village
Size-wood ...

305
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,390
... I knew Buzz Osborne
[ndt --> the 'Melvins']...

306
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:49,591
... whom I pass? ..

307
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,971
... a little 'compilation of
Punk-rock of ...

308
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:54,504
... on tapes made by him.

309
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,465
I wanted us some
days to assimilate ...

310
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:47,196
... wanted me pleasure ...

311
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:48,603
... it was like another world ...

312
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,913
... suddenly felt
stuff from another planet ...

313
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,617
I felt like ...
if speaking ...

314
00:26:54,652 --> 00:27:00,204
... so the most clear and realistic
of the usual texts Rock 'n Roll.

315
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,172
By the end
of the week ...

316
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:05,563
... I was a 'self-declared
Punk rocker-Journal '...

317
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:21,554
I cos? Pleased ...

318
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,298
... that I approached the
Punk-rock at that time ...

319
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,568
because ...? I said that those years
I used to grow ...

320
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:32,438
... and to make
fire my values ...

321
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,151
... and what kind of
person I am.

322
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,569
In reality? become
Punk-rocker ...

323
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,115
... aliment? my
self-esteem ...

324
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:20,479
because ...? Help me? understand that not
'I had' become a Rock-star ...

325
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,509
... not 'wanted' become
Rock-a star ...

326
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,083
... instead? not 'can'
diventarla ...

327
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:27,223
because ...? I lack the balls.

328
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,492
So I'm always
conflicting ...

329
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:32,389
... with these positions ...

330
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,390
... swings yet to not importarmi,
not wanting and not power ...

331
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,960
... still trying to
affermarmi with others.

332
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:45,692
I knew to do
something special ...

333
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,072
... to have something
to offer ...

334
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:53,528
... and I knew that I would have had the opportunity?
to show people ...

335
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:56,371
I could write ...
beautiful songs ...

336
00:28:56,572 --> 00:29:00,981
... or at least contribute
something, musically.

337
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,297
-- "When you
Krist met? "

338
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:07,947
I remember having
seen in high school ...

339
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,435
... a little 'times ...

340
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:12,554
... and that it wanted
certainly know.

341
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:15,713
But I have not ever seen,
if not in meetings.

342
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:19,597
Partecipava always
somehow "skit" ...

343
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:24,081
... and it was just a type intelligent,
beautiful and burst.

344
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:28,128
It was blatant that I
I wanted to form a group ...

345
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,814
... and find people
with which to play ...

346
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,274
... while Krist
did not want.

347
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:35,752
So I did the demo "Fecal Matter"
with Dale [ndt --> Crover "Melvins"]

348
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:38,435
trying to
Krist to make you feel ...

349
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:41,397
... what not
decided never to do ...

350
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:43,174
... Finch is a day
pass? by me and told me:

351
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:45,243
"I finally heard
your tape.

352
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,877
Not? Evil.
We are a group. "

353
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,093
It was the hour!

354
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,580
-- "So the group
begin? cos?

355
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:29,109
You had never done
a jam together? "

356
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,051
When did cover
of Creedence Clearwater ...

357
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:33,860
... did Jam
in the big house ...

358
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:35,411
... from Krist in Aberdeen ...

359
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,202
... which was very big.

360
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,467
It was freddissimo
a Met? winter ...

361
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:45,039
... and in the walls you saw the holes
from which passed the air.

362
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,772
Then I found work ...

363
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,571
... the "Polynesian Resort" ...

364
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:58,651
... leaned over.

365
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:00,667
It was a shit.
The hated.

366
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:03,756
But could not
work more than time ...

367
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:05,071
because ...? mainly ...

368
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,696
... spazzavo the chimneys of each
Chamber of ...

369
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,819
... and therefore could not
know where I was ...

370
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,974
during my ...
8 hours daily.

371
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:14,382
Often ...

372
00:31:14,383 --> 00:31:16,415
... no one was using
the fireplace ...

373
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,984
... then I pulivo
some fireplace ...

374
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,596
... correvo in here and l? ..

375
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:22,478
... and then slept
for a few hours ...

376
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,781
... and watched TV.

377
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,081
Just a beautiful job!

378
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:28,608
Unfortunately, it
insospettirono ...

379
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,471
and began ...
monitorarmi to ...

380
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,290
... and I beccarono.

381
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,056
-- "Since? Cos?"
-- Th?

382
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,599
I have always been
extremely lazy ...

383
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,393
especially at work.

384
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:42,343
Not? Work in s?

385
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,043
And 'try to stay
away from other colleagues.

386
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:48,324
I have always had
a terrible ...

387
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,813
relationship with ...
colleagues.

388
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,656
I do not own
agree with ...

389
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,221
... people in the media.

390
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,661
I give nuisance.

391
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:57,648
I give the
cos nerves? time ...

392
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:00,016
I can not ...
to ignore them.

393
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,692
I must face ...

394
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:03,928
... and tell them
that the hatred ...

395
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:05,892
... or not
even speak.

396
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:09,289
For almost all winter ...

397
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,774
... I did not have a place
to live.

398
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,558
Dormivo on
sofas people ...

399
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,630
... or in a box
the veranda of Dale.

400
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,056
Anywhere.

401
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,351
It was ganzo, perch? ..

402
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,068
... was convenient ...

403
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,715
sleep on ...
sofas people ...

404
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:27,390
because ...? finivo for
buy beer ...

405
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,964
... and that night
bevevamo ...

406
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:31,333
... and restavo l?
that night ...

407
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,447
... and the day after I was
from another party.

408
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:36,165
Facevo tour
the houses of all.

409
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:40,074
After a couple of months for?
I was not the most welcome ...

410
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:42,384
... and I was in misery.

411
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,911
Dormivo often
under a bridge ...

412
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:47,781
... and was also one of
winters most coldest weather memories.

413
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:49,636
A cold bestial.

414
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:53,792
I remember that walking
all day without goal ...

415
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:57,072
... and finivo always in the library.

416
00:32:57,073 --> 00:32:58,785
C'ho past
agonize ...

417
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,329
... read ...

418
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,245
... waiting for the
end of the day.

419
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,497
I was proud of me ...

420
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:39,844
... to be able to survive ...

421
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:41,576
... without a job.

422
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:45,281
I was living the life
by Punk-rocker.

423
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:47,477
Version Aberdeen.

424
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:50,590
It was pretty easy.

425
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,610
Nothing compared to that
that happens to the children ...

426
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:55,484
... fleeing in
big cities?

427
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:59,066
Chiedevo continuously
to my few friends ...

428
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:01,212
... to move with
me in Seattle.

429
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:02,830
I wanted to go
in Seattle ...

430
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:04,540
because ...?? there was life.

431
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,513
But none
wanted to go ...

432
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,886
... and alone
I was afraid.

433
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:24,445
I was in poverty?
pi? total ...

434
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,686
... always somewhere
small and sudicio.

435
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,597
For? Was fun.

436
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,317
I was a bachelor
for the first time.

437
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:34,325
All alone.

438
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:37,102
-- "Your mother said that you were happy
when you trasferisti in that place. "

439
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:41,206
Well, perch? Had
a group.

440
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:42,907
I felt independent.

441
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,553
I remember ...

442
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:53,607
... that years ago ...

443
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:56,011
... I asked Eric Shilinger:

444
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,498
"How could success
have a group ...

445
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:03,497
... if incrociasse the 'Black
Sabbath 'with' Beatles'?

446
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,482
What would be?

447
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,996
I want to do
all types of music.

448
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,499
I want to do a little '
such as Led Zeppelin ...

449
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,140
... but move from
Punk-rock extreme ...

450
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,378
the songs ...
insulse. "

451
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:20,314
"It seems to me impossible ...

452
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:23,684
because ...? nobody would understand
? the same group. "

453
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,236
At that point understood that
We had a unique style.

454
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,861
I do not think that we were
quite original.

455
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,693
I asked
many people ...

456
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,843
... and we thought often.

457
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,816
-- "E 'interesting perch? ..

458
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:38,120
many people ...
to which I ask ...

459
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:40,212
... 'Not surprisingly Kurt in
that period ?'...

460
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:43,631
meet ... 'I Not a fregava
cock of what we thought the other '. "

461
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:46,749
No. We certainly thought that
that people would have thought ...

462
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:47,873
... my music ...

463
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:49,138
because ...? knew that ...

464
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,244
... in order to do
ci? I wanted ...

465
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:54,710
I had to get ...
a base of fans.

466
00:35:55,646 --> 00:35:58,302
I would not have used
these terms at the time.

467
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:01,151
I do not understand how
does the music ...

468
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,134
... and as you pull
on the public.

469
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,517
We began to do
what seemed to us ...

470
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:08,888
... at all costs ...

471
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:11,664
... and there fregava a
cock if not liked ...

472
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:14,594
... even if trying to
accontentarli beginning ...

473
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,612
... to see what
happened.

474
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:21,748
Oh, I just mentioned
our first concert.

475
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:25,742
It was at a friend's house
of Erin, in the woods.

476
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,197
What fun!

477
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,168
They were all so?
afraid of us ...

478
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:32,744
... who hid
by us in the kitchen.

479
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:36,153
We had taken all
the rest of the house.

480
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,809
There were 50 toxic ...

481
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:39,886
... hidden in
cooking ...

482
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,693
because ...? did
cos? much noise ...

483
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:43,028
cos we were ...?
drunk ...

484
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:45,689
... Dolly and Tracy [?]
pomiciavano ...

485
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:50,286
... and I saltavo above the table
and I accarezzavano.

486
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,686
We are aware ridiculous.

487
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,318
Obviously, by
late in the evening ...

488
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,893
... most of the
girls present ...

489
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,220
... were convinced their
engaged in stonfarci ...

490
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:06,092
"It 'time to make the suitcases
and disappear, boys! "

491
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,062
Divenni obsessed
by turtles ...

492
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:20,804
... and bought 5 or 6 ...

493
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,712
... and put in a bathtub
bath in the living room.

494
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:26,407
They are very docile.

495
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,413
Do not move, not
show feelings.

496
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,634
I cos? .. inanimate.

497
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:33,804
I'm the idea most stupid for
a pet.

498
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:36,560
They are the exact
Unlike dogs.

499
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,217
Do not hate dogs.

500
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,016
They try too
get pleasure ...

501
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:41,496
... and you can do everything.

502
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:45,967
I like cats and animals
that require attention.

503
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,298
Of which you must
take care ...

504
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,736
... and that in return have a
attitude of 'vaffanculo'.

505
00:37:52,174 --> 00:37:54,527
'They are locked in a
bathtub, I'm from disgusting ...

506
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,793
... you hate and I
esibir? for you '.

507
00:37:57,966 --> 00:38:00,338
Those shells are not
of great help.

508
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,926
They are sensitive and if there
peaks feel pain.

509
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:07,669
Not? That much protection
one imagines that one.

510
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,373
They can fall back
break and die.

511
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,375
I always liked
go to Olympia ...

512
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,482
because ...? was a
wave of culture.

513
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:30,892
There was a
real 'scene'.

514
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,503
Something unique ...

515
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:36,041
... that could not be
find elsewhere in the United States.

516
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:41,809
For three years I was gone
a lot of a school ...

517
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,530
... on weekends
to see groups ...

518
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,779
... and stay with
friends.

519
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:50,890
I began to go out with
this girl, Tracy ...

520
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:53,745
... and we put together ...

521
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:56,290
... and we moved
along with Olympia.

522
00:39:57,158 --> 00:39:59,915
I found there
in this town ..

523
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:02,435
... with all the attention
to art.

524
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:06,612
I lived for the first time
in a town with culture.

525
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,806
It was an experience
magnificent.

526
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,631
I felt relieved.

527
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:45,585
Everyone seemed to share
the same ideals ...

528
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:47,894
... and the same reasons.

529
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,501
It was a community?
of 'strambi'.

530
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,080
Students
were outcasts ...

531
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:56,321
... even from the world
Punk-rock of ...

532
00:40:58,182 --> 00:41:01,139
... but listened
strange stuff ...

533
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,393
... and were influenced
from 'The Shaggs' ...

534
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,267
... and the 'Velvet Underground' ...

535
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:09,633
... and the 'Garage Rock'.

536
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:13,618
I had to thank
the 'K Records' ...

537
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,510
... and new music
I was introduced ...

538
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:19,493
... as the 'Vaselines' ...

539
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:22,975
... and a lot of European music,
especially British ...

540
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,574
... as the 'Young
Marble Giants' ...

541
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,453
... and the 'Clean axe' [?].

542
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,144
I did accorgermi ...

543
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:30,277
... which were years ...

544
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:33,841
... not ripensavo
to my childhood.

545
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:36,247
I had tried
to remove it.

546
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:41,264
I did reconsider and
draw good memories.

547
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,227
Reminders of innocence.

548
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:46,639
So I made tatuare
the symbol of 'K Records' ...

549
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,466
... to remember
childcare.

550
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,770
To remember
remain child.

551
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:35,341
It was become a
utopian place ...

552
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:38,307
... where all
scopavano you ...

553
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:41,538
... and there were events
improvised ...

554
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,920
... where groups played
stranissimi in places ...

555
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:48,712
... come on the scales of
corridor of a building ...

556
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,520
... or somehow
alley.

557
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,858
Everything was oriented
towards the 'community'.

558
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:58,004
Everybody gave a
hand with each other ...

559
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:01,298
... and played with everyone
groups of the other.

560
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:21,761
Their goal is not
was the success ...

561
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:23,801
... or do disks ...

562
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,303
... or go to
tour.

563
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:30,362
They were satisfied if
played between them.

564
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:32,440
Inventavano groups ...

565
00:43:32,802 --> 00:43:34,342
... which were not
real groups.

566
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:37,314
They were jam
with friends.

567
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,420
But I'm not there integravo
well with them ...

568
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:45,023
because ...?
tuttosommato ...

569
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,009
... were boring.

570
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,599
One of the things fiche ...

571
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,719
... type bohemienne
Olympia ...

572
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,454
... was that there were festivals ...

573
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:56,634
... where none
drank or drogava ...

574
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,464
but took ...
the coffee? ..

575
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,841
... and a rose
and esibiva.

576
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:04,094
Andavo to
these festivities ...

577
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:06,340
... and not happening
nothing.

578
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,308
All l? Seating ...

579
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:09,824
... hear the music ...

580
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:13,899
... while I optavo for
ascoltarmela alone.

581
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:19,264
I lived in my world
art imaginary ...

582
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:20,609
... in Aberdeen ...

583
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,248
... and I did the same
to Olympia.

584
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:26,130
Not? That a
aimed at Olympia ...

585
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:29,607
... I was blossomed and had begun
to attend the rounds ...

586
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:33,632
... and to participate in
cultural life ...

587
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:35,869
... but traevo benificio ...

588
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,870
standomene anyway ...
on the sidelines.

589
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,713
Restai a Monaco.

590
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:41,510
I have always
cos been?

591
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:43,583
Still Closed
at home.

592
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:46,623
Passavo week
without leaving home.

593
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,080
-- "What do you
Tracy thought ...

594
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,298
... this your
closure from the world ...

595
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:55,884
... without doing anything? "

596
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:59,377
There has never
been conflicts between us ...

597
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,693
because ...? knew that I would be
was equally happy ...

598
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:06,480
... a car or live in
in a sub-step.

599
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:10,678
The few times that propose
I cercassi a job ...

600
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,317
... rispondevo:
'Now I go ...

601
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:15,306
... and I'm going
in the car. '

602
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:20,486
And then replied: 'No, it should be
well. It is well at home. '

603
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:25,866
He had just one
maternal character.

604
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:28,700
He had to take
care of things and people.

605
00:45:29,242 --> 00:45:31,070
It was in four ...

606
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:33,034
... to spend
on me.

607
00:45:33,035 --> 00:45:34,503
Andavamo shops ...

608
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:36,358
... and if there was something
I wanted ...

609
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:38,085
... and I did not have the money ...

610
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:40,128
... I would have preferred
not take it ...

611
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,834
... but she took and the
then taking me out to dinner.

612
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,019
It was thick.

613
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,933
This me
feel guilty ...

614
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:48,508
because ...? ate
often outside.

615
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:51,467
I was always looking for
someone who was' artistic '...

616
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,418
... with whom I can share
things' artistic '...

617
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,464
... and with you
was impossible.

618
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,633
So, together,
did ...

619
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:01,410
... things to
husband and wife.

620
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,013
Activities? Typical of torque
American Media ...

621
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,203
... as shopping,

622
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:06,604
... and eat.

623
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:13,856
I had a strange ... attraction ...
Magnetic ... for flies.

624
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:16,849
The flies attracted me.

625
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,458
I svegliavo the morning ...

626
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,493
... and these flies me
kept awake for hours.

627
00:46:21,494 --> 00:46:24,095
Ronzavano and I
rimbalzavano on the face.

628
00:46:24,096 --> 00:46:25,176
I attacked ...

629
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,131
... continuously and
? always been so?

630
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,674
In summer, once,
while living with Tracy ...

631
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:33,123
every morning ...
I bombardavano ...

632
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,851
... and decided to attack
moschicida paper ...

633
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:38,189
... but it bought $ 20 ...

634
00:46:38,644 --> 00:46:40,342
... and are $ .50 each.

635
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:43,538
So I had, type,
40 hung above the bed.

636
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:44,854
Anywhere.

637
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:47,767
And the apartment
was great.

638
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:48,901
Charter moschicida everywhere.

639
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:51,935
He is very Death-rock ...

640
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:54,480
... have all these
flies death hung.

641
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,176
I have always furnished
my house with gusto.

642
00:47:01,177 --> 00:47:04,876
I was not the type to be put
20 crucifixes on the wall.

643
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:09,043
It was always a
pair, but those beautiful.

644
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,095
I did a lot of artistic stuff
at that time ...

645
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,179
how to take ...
models of skeletons ...

646
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:18,864
... and ricoprirli
clay ...

647
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:20,788
... making them become
small dolls.

648
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:22,145
Then the vestivo.

649
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,961
Scioglievo candles and we
I did scenes of nativit?

650
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,376
Roba ridiculous.

651
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:33,212
Copiai a lot
cassette ...

652
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,658
... and the spedii to all labels
I would think ...

653
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:39,091
... with small gifts inside ...

654
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:40,636
... or letters.

655
00:47:40,637 --> 00:47:42,610
Condoms used ...

656
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:45,877
... with ants inside.

657
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:48,217
Formichine plastic.

658
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:50,561
Coriandoli.

659
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:53,118
-- "This was for
find a label ... "

660
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,199
Th?

661
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,068
I have sent to
'Touch and Go' ...

662
00:48:07,903 --> 00:48:09,638
... a 'SST' ...

663
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:11,824
... to 'Alternative
Tentacles'.

664
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:13,787
At all.

665
00:48:15,255 --> 00:48:17,463
A 'Touch and Go' will
avr? send 20.

666
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:19,624
It was the label that
I wanted most of all ...

667
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,531
because ...? were the
my favorite groups.

668
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:23,637
I thought that
we were like ...

669
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:25,437
... groups as
'Scratch Acid' ...

670
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:27,059
... and 'Big Black' ...

671
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,423
... and the 'Butthole
Surfers'.

672
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:30,789
Three of my
Favourite groups.

673
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,257
At that time the Hardcore
had died ...

674
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:15,103
... was quite the
Speed-metal.

675
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:16,449
Odiavo that shit.

676
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:18,212
And the only solution ...

677
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:21,861
... was to do stuff cheerful or new-wave
as did at the beginning.

678
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:24,920
The 'Scratch Acid' I
cos liked? time ...

679
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:30,673
... was perch? their songs were
a pop and very simple ...

680
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:33,104
... you took us ...

681
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:36,806
... as a piece of 'Aerosmith',
scombussolato but ...

682
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,299
and ...? why did.

683
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,722
What I wanted to do.

684
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:33,222
I had developed Krist
a hatred for Seattle ...

685
00:50:33,653 --> 00:50:35,365
... and for the people of Seattle ...

686
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:41,614
... simply ... for our
need ... of 'not belonging'.

687
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:44,620
There were never
felt part of something ...

688
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:47,646
... and suddenly be accepted
in a 'scene' ...

689
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:51,619
... or one company? would not be
normal state, for us.

690
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,214
So we in costruivamo
head these things ...

691
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:56,363
... and we talked always
evil in Seattle.

692
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:58,736
It was cos? Degrading
be seen ...

693
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,393
... as a guy Aberdeen
that played rock ...

694
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,715
... and that he did not know
even the 'wipers'.

695
00:51:05,587 --> 00:51:08,940
Then they listened
7 years alone!

696
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,420
The 'scene'? Was not intense
as we expected ...

697
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:13,557
... or we wanted it to be.

698
00:51:13,558 --> 00:51:16,184
They are not grown in Seattle
and not the 'High-bourgeois'.

699
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:19,439
I fought against this
thing at all times.

700
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:21,865
People were
good with us ...

701
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:24,510
... but not ammettevamo.

702
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:32,295
We have known Jonathan
[ndt --> Poneman] of 'Sub Pop' in a bar ...

703
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:34,612
... and Krist was drunk
by morning.

704
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:40,143
We met at 23:00 and
Krist was drinking by 8:00.

705
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:43,509
It was sbronzo and fradicio
cos? aggressive ...

706
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:46,371
... which was impossible to speak
business with Jonathan ...

707
00:51:46,372 --> 00:51:50,625
because ...? Krist it was aimed
and pull rutti ...

708
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:54,983
... and ran shooting to scream
something to customers in the bar.

709
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:57,206
"What you have to look cock!"

710
00:51:58,803 --> 00:52:01,335
With his vociona.

711
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:04,078
He realised ridiculous.

712
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,846
It was buffissimo.

713
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:07,577
One of the things most funny
that I have ever seen.

714
00:52:08,384 --> 00:52:10,978
Jonathan was ready
to get up and leave.

715
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:14,395
I do not recall even if
we found an agreement, that day.

716
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:17,879
Krist was too
disruptive.

717
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,264
Do not made anything.

718
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:57,784
I believe that the influence of 'Sub Pop'
and what we tried to do ...

719
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:00,398
... we did think about
what to do ourselves.

720
00:53:00,399 --> 00:53:02,993
Acoltavo the individual
of 'Mudhoney' ...

721
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:04,285
... and stuff of that kind.

722
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:07,943
I think we influenz? In
'strip' our style ...

723
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:09,824
... and write a pop song.

724
00:53:09,825 --> 00:53:11,421
We had pop songs.

725
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,465
There were many things
we wanted to do ...

726
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:24,459
... we wanted to experiment
and vary ...

727
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,914
... with the hard 'Bleach' ...

728
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:28,138
... but there was cos? so
pressure from Sub Pop ...

729
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,858
... which was not fig ...

730
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:32,743
... do if you were a pop
Punk-rock group ...

731
00:53:32,744 --> 00:53:35,068
... and I wanted to mix
the two things.

732
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:38,221
But I was intimidated ...

733
00:53:38,222 --> 00:53:40,518
by the possible ...
reaction of the public ...

734
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:42,592
... if I had done
the stuff a little 'pop.

735
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,326
I had done so? Load ...

736
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:48,650
... philosophy bohemienne
musical revolution ...

737
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:50,782
... Having lived in Olympia ...

738
00:53:51,424 --> 00:53:54,192
... that I started to
prove resentment.

739
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:57,241
I wanted that people do not
cos take? cock seriously.

740
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:00,452
All seem in
dell'Utopia search ...

741
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,274
in the scene ...
Underground ...

742
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,914
... but there are so?
many factions ...

743
00:54:05,262 --> 00:54:07,767
... that if we do not
can unirne ...

744
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:08,768
... even a couple ...

745
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:13,236
... and to make them stop
bisticciare on each smallness ...

746
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:15,156
on which no
I disagree ...

747
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:18,909
... then as cock claim
to have an effect on the masses?

748
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:21,622
Well, my group was
in a situation ...

749
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:25,530
... in which we expected that combattesse
in a revolutionary ...

750
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:28,379
... against the machine
of corporate.

751
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:30,383
And I thought:

752
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,403
"How dare cock a dispute
cos under pressure? "

753
00:54:32,604 --> 00:54:33,865
E 'stupid.

754
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:01,172
-- "Tell more about that when sapesti
gave 'Love Buzz' on the radio ...

755
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:05,892
... and that while expecting guidavi
that the mandassero ...

756
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:07,986
... and finally you have approached ...

757
00:55:08,644 --> 00:55:10,681
... and you have called the station,
you requested the song ...

758
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,856
... and you had to wait in
machine that mandassero ...

759
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,190
because ...? were for
losing the signal. "

760
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:19,188
S? I remember.

761
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,605
-- "As was to hear
Your piece on the radio? "

762
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,539
Fantastic.

763
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,143
I did not believe that would be
never arrived at that point.

764
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:32,471
I thought I had a group
and that would have done a demo.

765
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:33,990
But my feeling
piece on the radio ...

766
00:55:34,942 --> 00:55:36,702
... was more than what was wondering.

767
00:55:38,428 --> 00:55:39,376
Great.

768
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,591
It was like having success
immediate and fame ...

769
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:44,565
... well beyond my hopes ...

770
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:45,951
... or my voluntary?

771
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:48,073
But at that level ...

772
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:51,446
... once had a taste,
I thought it was ganzo ...

773
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,507
... and that I wanted to hear ...

774
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,970
... My other recordings on the radio.

775
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:58,928
Managing to pay the rent ...

776
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:01,460
... with this group
would have been wonderful.

777
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:03,716
We were poor.

778
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:05,279
Prendevamo $ 30 a night ...

779
00:56:06,272 --> 00:56:07,278
... if played.

780
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:10,537
But we saw for
the first time the U.S. ...

781
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:13,259
... and we were a group ...

782
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,198
... and guadagnavamo enough
to survive.

783
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,464
It was fantastic.
Great.

784
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:18,979
Libert? Total.

785
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:23,950
I did not believe that there would be
could go better than what?

786
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:28,996
The rest of my life
would have been playing ...

787
00:56:28,997 --> 00:56:30,708
... and turn for the premises ...

788
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:33,874
... and interview any time
my pieces on the radio ...

789
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,039
... and live in a
apartment.

790
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:44,257
-- "After a short called by
all these corporate brands ...

791
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:46,114
... and you were served and
revered by all. "

792
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:47,581
We were pretty good ...

793
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:50,282
... with the labels and we
brought to dinner ...

794
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:51,728
... two, three times.

795
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,798
It was that
we wanted.

796
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:57,958
I remember
went to Capital ...

797
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,913
because ...? was
cos? disgusting ...

00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:03,048
... who finished for

... met? meeting.

00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,045
There was enough of a taste
their radio programmer.

801
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,906
A type Texan.

802
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:14,459
It seemed ready to
stonfare someone.

803
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:16,013
God, that fear.

804
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,320
He asked me:

805
00:57:17,556 --> 00:57:18,656
"Well. That
Song 'Polly' ...

806
00:57:18,657 --> 00:57:20,431
... you're beating,
the stronza? "

807
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:24,257
I replied:
"Absolutely."

808
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:30,498
Then came two other big
radio programmers ...

809
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:33,527
... and said: "We
Tickets for the Lakers! "

810
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:36,139
It lifted all in
feet to rejoice.

811
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,092
Capimmo that was not
the tag for us.

812
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:13,769
"Friend ... let us not kid ourselves.
We want to become the star! "

813
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,333
To tell the truth? That
we wanted to hear ...

814
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:21,122
because ...? not at that point
believed to have opportunity?

815
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:24,578
A band almost Alternatively,
shit from anybody.

816
00:58:25,032 --> 00:58:28,789
Pensammo the idea of
'have an impact' ...

817
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,862
... from commercial ...

818
00:58:30,863 --> 00:58:31,848

As unreal ...

All that quell'inverno

... in that small apartment ...

823
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:12,284
... was the period pi?
depressing of those years.

It was cos? Fottutamente
small and dirty ...

825
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:17,604
... and cold and gray.

826

Every cock

00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:21,196
I almost ...
the madness.

... and cos? poor.

831
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,988
There were months that we had
signed with 'Geffen' ...

832
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:29,223
... and we did not have a penny.

833
00:59:29,224 --> 00:59:32,251
We had to commit
the amplifier and TV ...

834
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,978
... just to have the money to
buy the Corn Dogs.

835

and be ...
completely green.

838
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:45,527
I was tired of
live in Olympia ...

839
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,262
... without anything
to be done.

840
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:50,318
The place had not
pi? nothing to offer me.

841
00:59:51,143 --> 00:59:52,670
I need to relocate.

842
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,299
Of go to Seattle.

01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,868
... begin the pain.

864
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:55,887
Why? Food us
is laying above.

865
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,481
Burn.

866
01:00:57,482 --> 01:01:01,197
I managed to ...
go forward.

867
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:04,955
It happens often
while I eat ...

868
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:08,853
... that I suffer a lot
but no one notices ...

869
01:01:08,854 --> 01:01:11,352
because ...? I
broke to complain.

870
01:01:11,353 --> 01:01:13,215
In tour happens
cos? often ...

871
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:16,970
because ...? I have no choice
not me my facts ...

872
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,040
... while others have no idea that
I am suffering like a dog.

873
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:23,665
Towards Met? ..

874
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,265
... the European tour ...

875
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:27,645
... remember ...

876
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:31,314
... having said that I would not have pi? toured
until? not risolvevo this thing.

877
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:34,139
I wanted to kill,
spararmi head ...

878
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,306
... from what
I had stew.

879
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:37,236
I can not
cos live?

880
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:41,058
I was
become ...

881
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:43,242
... a schizzato
neurotic.

882
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,170
I was destroyed
psychologically ...

883
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:47,355
... and I
mental problems ...

884
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:50,192
because ...? had pain
Chronic daily.

885
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:51,942
-- "When he was,
this? "

886
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:53,796
For the last
5 years.

887
01:01:55,749 --> 01:01:57,449
I arrived
in point ...

888
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,450
... in recent
two tour ...

889
01:01:58,451 --> 01:02:02,128
... I did not know how I would have
never done so to make others.

890
01:02:02,872 --> 01:02:08,666
But ... since I started
drogarmi I had the most pain.

891
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:11,329
-- "How did you know
Courtney? "

892
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:15,988
I have known both
time ago in Portland ...

893
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:18,224
... at one of our concerts.

894
01:03:18,624 --> 01:03:20,924
It was a quick meeting.
The said a sticker ...

895
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:22,412
parlammo ... and a little '.

896
01:03:23,793 --> 01:03:26,787
I seemed, type,
Nancy Spungen.

897
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:30,779
The resembling.

898
01:03:33,002 --> 01:03:35,451
It seemed a classic
pupa Punk-rock.

899
01:03:36,568 --> 01:03:39,288
I felt a little '
attracted to you ...

900
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:40,660
... I wanted to sweep
that night ...

901
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,133
but ... and? forth.

902
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,861
I wanted only ...

903
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,391
... a little 'more than emotion
in my life.

904
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,393
I had never
no known ...

905
01:03:49,899 --> 01:03:52,762
... what? jerk
and charismatic.

906
01:03:54,305 --> 01:03:57,430
She is a magnet for
exciting events.

907
01:03:57,431 --> 01:03:59,765
Although passeggiavamo
in the street together ...

908
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:02,836
spuntava someone who ...
assaliva us with a knife.

909
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:03,774
Without reason ...

910
01:04:03,775 --> 01:04:05,608
... just because? seems
that type of person ...

911
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,374
... that attracts these things.

912
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:09,623
I felt a rebel ...

913
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:12,735
because ...? there
went around ...

914
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:15,103
... to buy drugs ...

915
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:17,089
... a sweep against a wall ...

916
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,882
... and stuff of that kind.

917
01:04:19,787 --> 01:04:22,281
Facevamo rows in public,
both for the sake of it.

918
01:04:22,712 --> 01:04:25,734
Both perch? Entire people of a
table if it was mogia to eat.

919
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:27,812
It was so
I divertivo ...

920
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,263
... and it was fantastic interpret
this role ...

921
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:31,971
... with a person who suddenly
rose up ...

922
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:33,747
... and destroyed a
glass on the table ...

923
01:04:33,748 --> 01:04:34,939
... and I urlava against ...

924
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,179
... and I buttava on earth.

925
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:38,688
Really fun.

926
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:12,396
Krist is the kind that makes things
but in return wants the glory.

927
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,131
It must take the reins.

928
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:17,166
It must receive
all the attention.

929
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:20,272
I do not? Permit
be nice ...

930
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,676
... at his own level.

931
01:05:22,677 --> 01:05:24,944
I do not ever see
my humor ...

932
01:05:25,423 --> 01:05:26,468
... when I'm with him.

933
01:05:26,953 --> 01:05:31,210
This perch? Do everything
not to react if it happens.

934
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,841
I do not think I have ever
did laugh out loud ...

935
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:38,153
... and I know that it is capable
to make people laugh.

936
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:40,363
Courtney do the
always laughing ...

937
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:43,696
... and I feel comfortable
in being sympathetic with you ...

938
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:47,998
... and with Dave and other friends.

939
01:05:48,525 --> 01:05:52,977
But with Krist c '? Some
strange barrier that separates us.

940
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:57,941
We have always had
enough respect ...

941
01:05:57,942 --> 01:05:59,945
... to understand ...

942
01:05:59,946 --> 01:06:02,522
... what the ferisca
feelings of others ...

943
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:05,628
... and what are the defects
personalit? both ...

944
01:06:06,408 --> 01:06:12,815
... that give us discomfort in
so that we do not quarrel.

945
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:16,155
We have not ever
offended one another ...

946
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:18,859
... not perch? us
cos we want? well ...

947
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,782
... but both see
the other as hypocritical ...

948
01:06:21,783 --> 01:06:25,508
... with elements
that disprezziamo.

949
01:06:26,063 --> 01:06:28,820
For the good of the group,
does not make sense.

950
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:30,429
Once you are
the money arrived ...

951
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,803
... I understand what I was pi?
under pressure from the other ...

952
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:34,934
... and I accruing
Various' of pi?

953
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:39,193
I am the singer and
Articles are on me.

954
01:06:39,194 --> 01:06:40,775
I have to suffer
all the pressure.

955
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:44,096
And then I must also deal
composition of the pieces ...

956
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:47,189
... and I am also good if the
others are recognized ...

957
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:50,680
... but I expect at least one
Financial greater recognition.

958
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:54,186
This was a big
... problem with him and Dave.

959
01:06:54,187 --> 01:06:56,041
Credevano honestly
to earn ...

960
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,361
... a credit equal to mine.

961
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:00,548
I stronzate.

962
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,877
Stronzate totals.

963
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:05,077
I was ready to dissolve the group for
this thing ... we do not believe.

964
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:11,252
Often it is a
nihilistic idiot ...

965
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:13,962
fottutamente sarcastic ...

966
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,216
... and others are
very vulnerable ...

967
01:07:16,217 --> 01:07:17,701
... and sincere.

968
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,728
And? Cos? I
are the songs.

969
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:23,115
It 'a mixture of these things.

970
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:26,540
And? Cos? That are many
people of my et?

971
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,498
A minute
sarcastici are ...

972
01:07:29,315 --> 01:07:31,001
... and another
are apprensivi.

973
01:07:31,036 --> 01:07:34,710
They are still with the Monitor
things that I gave annoyance years ago.

974
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:36,886
-- "I'm not necessarily
personal things ...

975
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:38,287
... but also rapes,
violence ... "

976
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:42,711
S? I am posted
everything.

977
01:07:42,712 --> 01:07:44,312
So all
these songs ...

978
01:07:45,084 --> 01:07:49,114
... speak of my battles against
things that make me posted.

979
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:51,461
And is the theme of the album.

980
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:52,567
Of all my albums.

981
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,949
They say all the
same thing.

982
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,386
What I have this
conflict ...

983
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:58,184
... between good and evil ...

984
01:07:58,185 --> 01:07:59,286
... man and woman ...

985
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,141
... people who do things cruel
to other people without reason.

986
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,174
And I want them
beat blooded.

987
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:11,368
Here's the point.

988
01:08:13,196 --> 01:08:16,343
The only thing I can do, instead,
? scream into a microphone.

989
01:08:20,307 --> 01:08:23,320
Once I read
an article about me:

990
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:24,922
"Cazzo, qu? Seem ...

991
01:08:24,923 --> 01:08:27,380
... a depressed person ...

992
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:30,392
... and emotional,
sudden changes in mood. "

993
01:08:30,818 --> 01:08:34,003
And the author said to me:
"But the six."

994
01:08:34,592 --> 01:08:36,258
And I:
"No. I do not have!

995
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:38,241
I like fun,
every so often. "

996
01:08:39,454 --> 01:08:42,794
And 'all that I see as
an emotional disaster.

997
01:08:42,795 --> 01:08:45,413
Like a dark star.
A negative.

998
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,355
People I
always accuse ...

999
01:08:48,356 --> 01:08:50,009
... to be
bad mood ...

1000
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,334
and ask me:
"What?"

1001
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,601
And I have
absolutely nothing.

1002
01:08:54,286 --> 01:08:55,258
I'm not GI?

1003
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:58,264
I arrived
to the point that ...

1004
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:00,181
dovermi look ...
in the mirror ...

1005
01:09:00,715 --> 01:09:03,060
... and try to understand
cos'? that sees people.

1006
01:09:03,061 --> 01:09:05,485
I thought, "Maybe I should
shave the eyebrows.

1007
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:06,758
It might help. "

1008
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:08,808
Me asking
continuously.

1009
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:10,959
I went
in a room ...

1010
01:09:11,464 --> 01:09:12,739
... a couple of
months ago ...

1011
01:09:12,874 --> 01:09:14,747
... and a boy, cos?
asked me:

1012
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:18,619
"Christ, Kurt, but perch? Seems
you are always angry? "

1013
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,017
"I'm not
angry!

1014
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:22,952
I am happy now.

1015
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:24,580
Piece of shit! "

1016
01:09:51,372 --> 01:09:53,477
'C'? Something wrong?
Are you sad? '

1017
01:09:53,478 --> 01:09:56,994
Many people believe that
if the watch and not sorrido ...

1018
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:58,947
... I mean
run balls.

1019
01:09:58,948 --> 01:10:02,840
I effort to show
I'm enjoying.

1020
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:08,763
Generally I always fun, and
are almost never depressed.

1021
01:10:09,695 --> 01:10:11,692
And 'most easy cos?

1022
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,077
Opiates me
always procured ...

1023
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,860
that security ...
bramavo that ...

1024
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:23,947
... in which no hated
cos? both people.

1025
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:26,671
I could try
of affection for them ...

1026
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,037
... or at least look
beyond the superficialit? ..

1027
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:33,948
... of their personalit? ..

1028
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:36,183
... and think about them
as real people.

1029
01:10:36,184 --> 01:10:38,245
Maybe had
problems of childhood ...

1030
01:10:38,246 --> 01:10:41,040
or ...? their environment
that makes them so?

1031
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:44,645
In short, in order to appease the animosit?
that nutrivo towards the people.

1032
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:47,516
I needed
to do so ...

1033
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,313
because ...? I was tired of
cos hate? both the people ...

1034
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:54,358
... and to be always so?
Critical against them.

1035
01:10:56,112 --> 01:10:59,992
I know it seems that I defend
my use of drugs.

1036
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:01,989
Sounds like
an excuse.

1037
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:06,803
I must make a
drug-free period ...

1038
01:11:07,294 --> 01:11:10,141
... if only to see things
from a point of view better.

1039
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,787
In recent months I was
doing stuff for $ 400 per day ...

1040
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:17,824
... and I was notice of
odd in my memory ...

1041
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,701
... and that sooner or later it
would have affected my health.

1042
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:28,355
But the truth? That I was pi?
in flesh and healthy then ...

1043
01:11:28,714 --> 01:11:29,785
... that now.

1044
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:34,069
I said immediately that
I do not pentivo.

1045
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,051
I do not repent.

1046
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,272
This perch? Used the
as a means ...

1047
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,522
... as an anti-dolorifico.

1048
01:11:43,523 --> 01:11:45,303
To rid the pain.

1049
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:47,806
And 'reason
main.

1050
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:51,857
And in that sense
I do not repent.

1051
01:11:51,858 --> 01:11:54,761
But, any person who
becomes dependent on drugs ...

1052
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:57,882
... finir? for
fottersi life.

1053
01:11:57,883 --> 01:12:00,081
Unless it takes a year,
we want two.

1054
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:02,549
And 'cos? Obvious.

1055
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,398
I have seen succeed
all those who we fall.

1056
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:08,002
It 'a classic.

1057
01:12:08,003 --> 01:12:10,725
'The drugs are
evil and you fotteranno. '

1058
01:12:12,192 --> 01:12:15,336
I knew that I would have
stopped sooner or later ...

1059
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,267
... and marry and
have a daughter ...

1060
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:19,496
... is a very good
incentive.

1061
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:20,834
But many do not
ce have.

1062
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:23,669
Then a rich
Rock-star milionaria ...

1063
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,828
... and I both
be considered.

1064
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:28,782
I have a lot of reasons
for not drogarmi ...

1065
01:12:29,905 --> 01:12:32,952
... but many people who will
influenced by my drogarmi ...

1066
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:37,143
... will be people with a job
normal that already? make fatigue.

1067
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:41,125
-- "It seems you should say that goes
well if you droghi you ... "

1068
01:12:41,126 --> 01:12:42,683
I know, in fact.

1069
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,683
And 'why
I have to move forward.

1070
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,750
I say that sooner or later ...

1071
01:12:50,222 --> 01:12:51,826
... if I had continued
drogarmi to ...

1072
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:53,475
... I would have lost everything.

1073
01:13:13,163 --> 01:13:16,224
-- "What attracts you to these
models' transparent '? "

1074
01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:19,779
I do not like puzzles, but
I like the idea that unmount them.

1075
01:13:20,426 --> 01:13:23,949
I fascinate the
casings and bodies.

1076
01:13:24,427 --> 01:13:25,672
How it works.

1077
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,793
Often spoiling.

1078
01:13:28,382 --> 01:13:31,282
But? Difficult to think
that a person ...

1079
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:34,952
... can enter stuff harmful
as drugs and alcohol in his system ...

1080
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:37,050
... and that the body
the bear.

1081
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:38,228
For a while '.

1082
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,383
But that little '?
astounding.

1083
01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:00,360
God, it has been incredible.

1084
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,292
One of the things
most amazing.

1085
01:14:02,293 --> 01:14:03,822
Especially perch? ..

1086
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,437
... was not a photo,
was a video ...

1087
01:14:06,438 --> 01:14:08,140
... and we saw
move.

1088
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:12,645
It was the first time that we heard
it was a living creature.

1089
01:14:14,686 --> 01:14:16,996
Incredible. We saw
the heart beating.

1090
01:14:16,997 --> 01:14:20,213
And the first thing that has
done with your hands ...

1091
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:23,202
...? been the greeting
metal with horns ...

1092
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:25,921
... waving his arm.

1093
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:30,853
If n '? Also noticed
the pediatrician ...

1094
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:35,539
... and us: "What? sign
of the devil, Doctor. "

1095
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:44,876
Some days I feel
most paranoid than usual ...

1096
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:52,183
... but now what? born
Frances are not pi?

1097
01:14:54,499 --> 01:14:56,498
Yes? Simplified everything ...

1098
01:14:57,733 --> 01:14:59,012
... in recent years ...

1099
01:14:59,013 --> 01:15:01,577
... since I real
relations of friendship ...

1100
01:15:01,578 --> 01:15:03,897
... with real friends ...

1101
01:15:03,898 --> 01:15:06,063
... with the group ever
most famous ...

1102
01:15:06,064 --> 01:15:09,859
... and then find a person
I love has solved many problems.

1103
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:14,959
It 'very exciting, perch?
what I always wanted.

1104
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:17,856
E '... ideal.

1105
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:20,504
It is better to me,
probably ...

1106
01:15:22,194 --> 01:15:27,020
because ...? I find myself in a situation
most stable than Courtney.

1107
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:32,622
Find many difficulties in
find confidence in herself ...

1108
01:15:32,623 --> 01:15:37,012
because ...? his character?
been very targeted.

1109
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:42,750
She and her group are
cos? under examination.

1110
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:46,073
It should bring out
a disc incredible ...

1111
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,610
... only to be
considered decent.

1112
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:52,147
I believe that his songs
are really good ...

1113
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,487
but ...? very difficult
convince you of this.

1114
01:15:59,468 --> 01:16:01,030
-- "I think a little '
people ask ...

1115
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:04,041
... why deals
affairs of her husband. "

1116
01:16:04,109 --> 01:16:06,689
Why? I am too
lazy to occuparmene.

1117
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:10,426
Both would bend and
put me in culo, from them.

1118
01:16:11,854 --> 01:16:14,041
And 'I forget
always things ...

1119
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:16,099
... and c '? people
we campaign ...

1120

... and I exploits.

1121
01:16:17,943 --> 01:16:21,820
For me to do something
from management ...

1122
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:23,619
... must? ask
20 times.

1123
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,245
And we bring,
type, 4 months.

1124
01:16:26,738 --> 01:16:28,921
At the end Courntey them
calls and cries in the face.

1125
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:31,307
Her cries the
remain in the head.

1126
01:16:32,635 --> 01:16:34,856
Riattaccano and
think 'What whore'.

1127
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,590
But the thing
is done.

1128
01:16:37,365 --> 01:16:39,086
E 'for the good
of our children ...

1129
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:41,306
... make sure that

1130
01:16:41,307 --> 01:16:42,634
... for the next
10 years.

1131
01:16:44,096 --> 01:16:45,778
But we do
progress.

1132
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:47,411
I'm learning from her.

1133
01:16:49,456 --> 01:16:52,896
But often jumps
suffered the conclusions ...

1134
01:16:53,531 --> 01:16:55,169
and ...? his
weakness.

1135
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,376
I do not like not come
taken quite seriously.

1136
01:17:01,113 --> 01:17:05,367
And 'the type of person
seems selfish and bad ...

1137
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:08,222
... but with these things?
very most loving me.

1138
01:17:08,643 --> 01:17:11,122
If we think or me
is recalled ...

1139
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:12,676
... then do it.

1140
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:18,865
But you? Always to do things for
others, to buy gifts.

1141
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:21,639
And? Always
me compliments.

1142
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:23,140
It 'something
fantastic.

1143

... but nobody thinks effect on
persons to whom is happening. "

1145
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:38,719
Of course. We are cock of
characters in the comics.

1146
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,708
Mica we have
fottuti sentiments us.

1147
01:17:40,844 --> 01:17:43,014
And the people who

... can the succhiarmi
cock and give me $ 10 ...

Li willingly take,
their money.

1151
01:17:53,307 --> 01:17:54,329
One thing ...

1152
01:17:55,573 --> 01:17:56,858
... I did not
never understood ...

1153
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,900
...? that the classic response ...

1154
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,727
... a celebrit?
who complains?

1155
01:18:04,242 --> 01:18:06,534
"Have you wanted a bicycle?
Now pedal. "

1156
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:07,915
And 'us? That
expect.

... and everyone has the right to
know everything about you.

01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:16,534
No journalist has a cock of
right to ask me if I drogo.

1160
01:18:16,796 --> 01:18:18,680
I am not their cocks.

1161
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:21,083
If they want to ask the
music and of how I write ...

1162
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:22,787
... we will.

1163
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,736
Obviously also the
? related to staff ...

1164
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:27,974
... but not as
people believe.

1165
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:30,248
I have always
After harassed ...

1166
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:32,821
... and I disagree
with those who say:

1167
01:18:33,664 --> 01:18:35,289
"Everyone has a right to know."

1168
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:39,346
I have the right to change
that perception.

1169
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:43,861
I have the right to change the way in
where people think to celebrit?

1170
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:46,628
It should be changed.

1171
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,427
Should be treated as human beings
and respected in matters private.

1172
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:47,410
As believe that we can take
if we are ever attacked cos?

1173
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:51,581
They believe that we always scioglieremo
fault of our actions.

1174
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:55,641
But it would be only a 'reaction' to that
that we are cock of the press.

1175
01:19:58,515 --> 01:20:00,542
-- "Have you ever thought
to sciogliervi for this? "

1176
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,238
In continuation.

1177
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:05,516
This year I left
the group 10 times.

1178
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:08,337
Officially.

1179
01:20:09,324 --> 01:20:12,279
E 'which are to the point that not
I cos? both the group ...

1180

... to be affected most
these consequences.

1181
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:19,351
Moreover, the attacks are
all against Courtney and me.

1182
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:21,696
Krist and Dave should not
letting a cock to do.

1183
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:24,740
The other day he Krist

1184
01:20:24,775 --> 01:20:28,712
... that would be involved
a reading of poems ...

1185
01:20:29,644 --> 01:20:31,783
... in England.
And? Monitor.

1186
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:33,689
"How dare!"

1187
01:20:34,024 --> 01:20:35,441
And I: "God, Krist ...

1191
01:20:43,061 --> 01:20:44,987
People there smerdano
continuously.

1192
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:47,452
They want dirt and
telling lies about us.

1193
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:49,273
I do not understand.

1194
01:20:49,274 --> 01:20:52,892
I never tried throughout my
life to do something scandalous.

1195
01:20:53,213 --> 01:20:54,954
I do peace.

1196
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:57,794
I want picchiarli ...
to death.

1197
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,196
I am a firm supporter
revenge.

1198
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:02,866
C 'is a time and a
place for violence ...

1199
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:04,634
... in every situation.

1200
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:07,005
Obviously I very much
to lose, now ...

1201
01:21:07,006 --> 01:21:08,599
... therefore not potr? do so.

1202
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:11,561
But I have everything else
of my life.

1203
01:21:12,213 --> 01:21:15,079
I do not want to gain influence over
in my family.

1204
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,602
If ever I trover? Into misery
and avr? lost my family ...

1205
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:22,571
... if I find myself in front
the cleft face.

1206
01:21:23,206 --> 01:21:27,653
I have always been able to
vendicarmi against those who break me.

1207
01:21:28,241 --> 01:21:31,347
They are the life form pi?
that there is ruthless.

1208
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:32,434
Journalists.

1209
01:21:32,435 --> 01:21:35,239
Think of heads cock
menefreghiste and evil.

1210
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,800
The people most cruel that
I have ever known.

1211
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:39,946
They are disgusting.

1212
01:21:40,998 --> 01:21:42,951
I have no respect
for journalists.

1213
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:48,664
Shit.
-- "Forgive me."

1214
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:51,258
But you also do
other things in life.

1215
01:21:51,903 --> 01:21:55,889
Try to find
the story inside ...

1216
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,030
... without inventarci
round of lies.

1217
01:21:58,068 --> 01:21:59,600
They are the ones
persons referred talking about.

1218
01:21:59,601 --> 01:22:01,950
Guardacaso,
are 99%.

1219
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:08,751
Anything we do ...

1220
01:22:08,752 --> 01:22:10,533
... as
live clean ...

1221
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:11,915
not overcome ...
live this thing.

1222
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,689
Why? There are
too many cock of enemies ...

1223
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,654
... and we threaten
too many people.

1224
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:18,159
We have offended
too many people.

1225
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:20,626
Everyone wants
see us die.

1226
01:22:23,454 --> 01:22:28,246
And maybe andr? Forward, to face them,
of those pieces of shit.

1227
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:31,072
They GI? Valicato ...

1228
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:35,499
... the limit most offensive, which
? attack my family.

1229
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:37,755
And I could go
forward for years ...

1230
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:42,977
... but there will be? a time when
riuscir not the most to manage it.

1231
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:47,305
When my daughter will? Enough
great to understand what's happening.

1232
01:22:47,306 --> 01:22:48,776
Th? Now ...

1233
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:52,342
... maybe in 12 years legger?
old magazines ...

1234
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:56,115
... and ask? "It 'true that there
drogavate when I was a newborn? "

1235
01:22:56,548 --> 01:22:58,896
Sar? Lasts convince ...

1236
01:22:58,897 --> 01:23:00,836
... with all things
that are not true.

1237
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:06,037
I can not see me between 10 years ...

1238
01:23:06,072 --> 01:23:09,249
... to fight still in
this stupid battle.

1239
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:13,162
At that hour vorr? Stand
produce disks alone ...

1240
01:23:13,163 --> 01:23:15,468
... under different names.

1241
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:18,788
Why? Not potr most common to find
pleasure, at that point.

1242
01:23:22,274 --> 01:23:27,394
The moment the most beautiful of a band? Stage
the first to become really famous.

1243
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:31,261
I would like to be a band
that does this every two years.

1244
01:23:31,262 --> 01:23:34,696
-- "Take a step back
whenever explodes? "

1245
01:23:34,697 --> 01:23:35,937
Yes, cock.

1246
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:40,429
The best memories I have of this
are before the group of 'Nevermind'.

1247
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:41,516
It was a fun.

1248
01:23:44,627 --> 01:23:47,677
Without that I want
? become a job.

1249
01:23:47,678 --> 01:23:49,163
What I like it or not.

1250
01:23:49,164 --> 01:23:52,268
It 'something that I love
and would always do ...

1251
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:54,059
... but honestly ...

1252
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,534
... I do not like pi?
As once ...

1253
01:23:56,535 --> 01:23:58,247
when tried ...
every night ...

1254
01:23:58,248 --> 01:24:00,114
Imagine ...
as it was.

1255
01:24:00,115 --> 01:24:03,619
Not the most as
in the first two years.

1256
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,258
Playing before a
handful of people.

1257
01:24:06,764 --> 01:24:10,374
Load a van and
go to a concert Rock.

1258
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:11,545
Playing.

1259
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:16,282
That privilege can not?
play after 10 years.

1260
01:24:18,797 --> 01:24:22,232
Sometimes,
I fall asleep ...

1261
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,101
... when I'm tired of
persons or bored ...

1262
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:28,487
... if they are immersed in a group
of people and I do not want to be ...

1263
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:30,076
... type in the back-stage ...

1264
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:33,668
... or during the tour,
in general.

1265
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:37,000
I sleep all day.
Prefer to be in a coma.

1266
01:24:37,938 --> 01:24:41,011
I would like to wake up
on stage and playing ...

1267
01:24:41,012 --> 01:24:43,448
... and then tornarmene
in my own little world.

1268
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:49,125
-- "Based on the assumption that
everything on stage is working ...

1269
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:53,098
... and you're playing by God and
everything is going to 100% ...

1270
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:56,787
... what you pass
for the head?

1271
01:24:57,848 --> 01:24:59,350
Are you happy? "

1272
01:24:59,351 --> 01:25:03,270
It 'a mixture of all
emotions that I have ever tried.

1273
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:05,736
And 'everything. Rabies ...

1274
01:25:05,737 --> 01:25:10,236
Death ... and
bliss absolute.

1275
01:25:10,596 --> 01:25:14,941
Happy as when I was a
child without concerns ...

1276
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:16,482
that pull the stones
the cops.

1277
01:25:17,607 --> 01:25:19,113
And 'everything.

1278
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,377
Every song ...

1279
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:22,114
... I feel differently.

1280
01:25:22,936 --> 01:25:26,526
And the energy that I
transmit the public.

1281
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:29,853
Often I'm playing
thinking to another ...

1282
01:25:29,854 --> 01:25:32,288
... and, lifting her gaze
Public

1283
01:25:32,289 --> 01:25:34,573
... I notice that are
really enjoying.

1284
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:37,119
And I
makes happy.

1285
01:25:40,984 --> 01:25:46,285
-- "Do you believe that this group durer?
until the next decade? "

1286
01:25:47,538 --> 01:25:49,304
I do not ...

1287
01:25:49,305 --> 01:25:51,094
... but it could.

1288
01:25:51,289 --> 01:25:52,727
It depends
everything ...

1289
01:25:53,342 --> 01:25:55,568
... because they are
good songs.

1290
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,026
I was surprised ...

1291
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:01,852
to find ...
lately ...

1292
01:26:01,853 --> 01:26:05,599
... to work as
a real unit?

1293
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,432
We even
wrote a piece 'together' ...

1294
01:26:07,433 --> 01:26:08,912
and ...? coming
not bad.

1295
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:11,767
Typically me
occupavo it myself.

1296
01:26:13,028 --> 01:26:15,981
But I do not know how much I
can still do ...

1297
01:26:16,396 --> 01:26:19,619
... with Dave, Krist and sounds
of my voice and guitar.

1298
01:26:19,858 --> 01:26:21,400
I would like time ...

1299
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:23,419
... play with
other people.

1300
01:26:25,338 --> 01:26:28,429
But? Almost impossible to find
people with whom go in favour ...

1301
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:29,453
... and people ...

1302
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:33,411
the musically ...
think like me.

1303
01:26:33,876 --> 01:26:36,672
And 'why? Cos?
easy to play with Courtney.

1304
01:26:36,673 --> 01:26:39,409
Whenever
improvvisiamo ...

1305
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:41,635
... write a
great song.

1306
01:26:41,636 --> 01:26:42,695
E 'incredible ...

1307
01:26:43,808 --> 01:26:46,192
because ...? she is a person
which takes the command ...

1308
01:26:46,193 --> 01:26:47,619
... and is not afraid of ...

1309
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,770
... be the boss.

1310
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:52,843
And when you have two
leaders together ...

1311
01:26:53,843 --> 01:26:55,531
... everything worked well.

1312
01:26:55,532 --> 01:26:58,258
How I wish I could play
with other people ...

1313
01:26:58,259 --> 01:26:59,921
... and create something new.

1314
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:02,491
I'd prefer that to
remain in Nirvana.

1315
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:11,561
It 'sad to think what will?
the state of Rock 'n' Roll ...

1316
01:27:11,562 --> 01:27:13,403
... between 20 years.

1317
01:27:15,082 --> 01:27:18,777
I feel that when the Rock will?
esploder dead? the whole world.

1318
01:27:20,185 --> 01:27:24,106
And? Gi? Cos?
Fried and re-fried ...

1319
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:26,627
... copied ...

1320
01:27:27,526 --> 01:27:30,971
... what? barely alive
GI? now.

1321
01:27:31,764 --> 01:27:32,961
E 'disgusting.

1322
01:27:32,962 --> 01:27:36,584
For the children of today are not interested in
pi? because once, the Rock.

1323
01:27:37,146 --> 01:27:38,839
As the latest
generations.

1324
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,787
Now? Become only a
declaration of fashion and identity? ..

1325
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,229
... that children use to sweep
and have a social life.

1326
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:52,246
And at this point, I do not see really
as the music could most ..

1327
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:54,579
... have a
for a teenager.

1328
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,237
Useranno
sounds and tones ...

1329
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,853
... in their machines
in reality? virtual ...

1330
01:28:01,978 --> 01:28:05,095
... in order to receive
the same emotions.

1331
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:07,740
And then go to a party.

1332
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:09,995
There Sar? Machinery
in reality? virtual ...

1333
01:28:09,996 --> 01:28:11,465
... with a lot of headphones.

1334
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:15,638
And potr? Talk to the people
while listening to this machine ...

1335
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:18,131
... and then go to room
and fuck and drink ...

1336
01:28:19,473 --> 01:28:22,414
... but I believe above all that
reality? virtual sar? a drug.

1337
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:24,320
The technology we arriver?

1338
01:28:26,019 --> 01:28:28,638
And there are toxic-dependent
from reality? virtual.

1339
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:30,513
Li will find
dead on the sofa ...

1340
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,384
... for 'overdose'.

1341
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:40,788
Death in general or
death by overdose?

1342
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:42,091
-- "In general."

1343
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:45,513
E 'whole life
I expect to death ...

1344
01:28:45,514 --> 01:28:47,132
... as any
normal person.

1345
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,359
I thought
cos? often ...

1346
01:28:52,324 --> 01:28:55,679
... to kill for
stomach pain ...

1347
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,722
... that I do not fregava
a cock to die.

1348
01:28:57,723 --> 01:29:00,064
I would be fired
in the head.

1349
01:29:00,065 --> 01:29:03,162
Both true risk
die for the drugs.

1350
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:07,821
-- "E 'sad your story?"

1351
01:29:08,662 --> 01:29:10,583
No.

1352
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:12,862
Not really.

1353
01:29:14,781 --> 01:29:18,258
There '? Nothing
incredible ...

1354
01:29:18,259 --> 01:29:20,761
... or new,
if for that.

1355
01:29:24,483 --> 01:29:25,901
No. I do not?

1356
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,253
They are the product of
un'America flawed.

1357
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:35,083
Think about what could have been
be worse my life ...

1358
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:38,511
... if I had grown up in another place,
perhaps in economic crisis.

1359
01:29:39,325 --> 01:29:42,777
There are endless things worse than a
Divorce can happen to you.

1360
01:29:43,965 --> 01:29:45,100
I only ...

1361
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:49,458
bramato and suffered for a
something that I could not have:

1362
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:51,018
a family.

1363
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,054
A solid
Unit? family.

1364
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,350
After a long time,
I am well.

1365
01:29:56,768 --> 01:30:01,694
I'm happy to share
this with similar cases.

1366
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,479
All in all,? Sad that
two people can not ...

1367
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,095
... if they decide to
marry and make children ...

1368
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,777
... at least get along.

1369
01:30:14,088 --> 01:30:15,162
I wonder ...

1370
01:30:16,137 --> 01:30:18,524
... that persons
think they love ...

1371
01:30:18,525 --> 01:30:20,057
... can not
Nor ...

1372
01:30:21,518 --> 01:30:25,222
... do pretend, or at least have
enough respect for the children ...

1373
