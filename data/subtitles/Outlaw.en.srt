00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,000
I must point out the room has never
been used as an office by Manning.

173
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
But instead as a storage space

174
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,800
to house our client's extensive collection
of vintage model racing cars

175
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,760
numbering in excess to 1,400.

176
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,920
You getting in?

177
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,880
I've seen inside your room, sir.

178
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,920
Yeah? What did you see?

179
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
Would you like a cup of tea?

180
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,880
AK-47 s, Remingtons, Glocks, Sigs.

181
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm guessing you were in the army.
You can't get that on the street

182
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,720
unless you're friendly with the Taliban.

183
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,200
I wanted to be in the army. They
wouldn't let me. Got a criminal record.

184
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,640
In the TA for a while.
Got kicked out of there.

185
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,360
Got a bit heavy with one of the NCOs.

186
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Fucking Black thought he was Rambo.

187
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Came unstuck with me, though.

188
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,480
Here, talking about Blacks, guess what's
happened to an old barrister of mine.

189
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
No?

190
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,240
Someone's only gone and stabbed his
pregnant missus in the stomach.

191
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
Killed their baby. How sick's that?

192
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,720
People like us...
We wouldn't stand for it, would we?

193
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,640
I'd kill them with my bare hands.

194
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,480
What did you do?

195
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
Didn't do nothing. He was my barrister
years ago. Something about football.

196
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,760
- I just heard about it.
- No, I mean, what do you do?

197
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,240
Here?

198
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
Head of security. Good job. I like it.

199
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Here, look, I wanna show you
something. You're a soldier.

200
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,360
You'll like this.

201
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,560
Rigged it all up myself.
No one else knows about it.

202
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,840
Both got a secret, you and me.

203
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
It's a dirty fucking world.

204
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,480
I've seen things happen in these rooms
you wouldn't have seen as a soldier.

205
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,040
Trust me.

206
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You could stay here if you wanted.

207
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm married.

208
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm not a queer if that's what you think.
I just meant you could stay here.

209
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Use the camp bed
whilst you sort yourself out.

210
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,480
It's up to you.

211
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,400
What's the matter, mate?
You look really upset.

212
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
I pissed you off?

213
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
- No.
- Is it me? Have I pissed you off?

214
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,520
It's all right. I'll be fine. I just need
to get my head down, all right?

215
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,800
Maybe I'll see you soon, eh?

216
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,560
I could call your missus for you,
if you want.

217
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Let her know where you are.

218
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,080
- 'Hello, Mardell speaking. '
- Sir. It's Bryant.

219
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
'Bryant. How are you? '

220
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I need to see you, sir.

221
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,680
'OK, well, come over in the morning. '

222
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,640
Yes, sir.

223
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,040
Goodnight, soldier.

224
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,560
It's beautiful, sir.

225
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,080
Beats Kandahar.

226
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Now, what's on your mind, Bryant?

227
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,400
Is everything OK at home?

228
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Yeah.

229
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Then why did you come here?

230
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,480
It's just... I don't know.
I don't see the point, sir.

231
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,520
You know? Being over there
and then coming home.

232
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,600
It's almost worse here.

233
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,800
You're a soldier. It's your job.
What do you want, sympathy?

234
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,960
No, but I wanna do something,
you know?

235
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,120
I don't wanna be
just another face in the crowd,

236
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
otherwise what was I doing out there?

237
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,720
I wanna... I wanna be remembered.

238
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,920
That'll be Sandy.

239
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
How is he, sir?

240
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,680
He never even
made it back to Cambridge.

241
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Talk to him, Bryant.

242
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,480
He liked you.

243
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,120
What would you do to them
if you could find them, Sandy?

244
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,720
They go around wrecking lives.

245
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
And when they get caught, they get
a slap on the wrist. If it were me, I'd...

246
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,880
Help me.

247
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
Thanks, Sarge.

248
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,200
There was a man, Walter.

249
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,920
He followed me into the toilet and he
threatened me. Told me to walk away.

250
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,320
I can't prove it.

251
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,680
So it will never come to light.

252
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,560
And Manning was in the same room as
me when this happened to Marcia.

253
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,360
So how are we going to pin it on them?

254
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
We can't.

255
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,080
I mean, I should know. It's my job.

256
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,040
It was my wife.

257
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,640
They tried to kill my wife.

258
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
And they killed my baby.

259
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,960
Oh, God...

260
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,760
She's gonna pull through, Cedric.
She's gonna be all right.

261
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah.

262
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,360
Can I help you?

263
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
My name's Hillier.
You represented me a while back.

264
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,200
- How did you know where I live?
- I work in security, remember?

265
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,560
These are for your loss.

266
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Thank you very much, Hillier.
That is... very kind of you.

267
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,280
Listen carefully. I know a man who can
help you with what's just happened.

268
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,160
You call us on this number if you want
to do something. It's up to you.

269
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
City boy.
Yeah, it is a long time no speak.

270
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
Really?

271
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,280
Come to the hotel tomorrow at 5:00.
Don't knock on the door.

272
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,360
OK.

273
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,560
That was the geezer
I went to school with. Complete nutter.

274
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,920
- He knows people.
- You're gonna get them done?

275
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,040
I'm gonna do something.

276
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Oi, Dekker.
Have you thought about our little deal?

277
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Dan, please. Look at the state of me.

278
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,080
You've got a week.
Otherwise you'll get ironed out again.

279
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,520
Right.

280
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,280
He'd be on the list as well.
You watch, Frank.

281
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
He'll get served.

282
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,520
They didn't fuck about with you,
did they?

283
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
That's why I'm here, Simon.

284
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,600
What do you need?

285
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,840
I dunno.

286
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah.

287
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,800
You know me, Gene.
I'll get whatever you want.

288
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,320
How much?

289
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,240
What are you doing?
Put it away. Don't work like that.

290
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,560
Put it away.

291
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,840
If you're gonna do anything,
don't do it on your own.

292
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,080
I know people.

293
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,960
Mate of mine.

294
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,680
Fucking hurt there.

295
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,120
Can I meet him?

296
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
Yeah.

297
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,880
But if I set it up,
I don't want you fucking about.

298
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,600
Hmm? Me and my mate,
we go to work properly, understand?

299
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,680
So what now?

300
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
- 'Hello? '
- How can you help me?

301
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,000
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '
- Where is that?

302
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,040
- 'Look in your files. Under Hillier. '
- I'll be there.

303
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,280
Good. And don't knock on the door.

304
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
- 'How can you help me? '
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '

305
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,560
'Where is that? '

306
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,560
What am I doing here?

307
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm a barrister, for Chrissakes.

308
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,720
You've got nowhere else to go.

309
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,240
I am really sorry.

310
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,960
I have to go. I can't do this.

311
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,840
- I am supposed to uphold the law.
- But the law's failed you.

312
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,520
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Bryant.

313
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,040
You know where I am now.

314
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,720
- When did you get down here?
- Day before yesterday.

315
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,720
Took Dad's car.

316
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,160
It's good you came.
You should be proud of yourself.

317
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,640
Proud I can drive? Look at me.

318
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,280
Think I'm having
a get-together this week.

319
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,240
Just a few like-minded people,
you know?

320
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,240
Should er... Should come along.

321
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,440
To do what?

322
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,480
Nothing special. Maybe a bit of keep fit.

323
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Good for you.

324
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,640
Even if you just say hello.

325
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,120
- I'm gonna go.
- No, stay, it's OK.

326
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,240
I don't wanna be like this all my life.

327
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm so sorry, Mr Monroe.

328
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,520
There's nothing more we could do.

329
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,160
Come in.

330
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,680
What are you doing here?

331
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Eh?

332
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,800
I said what the fuck are you doing here?
Why have you come here?

333
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,200
To learn how to fight.

334
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Says who?

335
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,080
- Hillier said you'd teach us how to fight.
- I can't teach you how to fight.

336
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,120
Because you already can.

337
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,640
It's already in you.

338
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,600
- Where are you going, Monroe?
- I can't do this.

339
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I...

340
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,560
Sorry to hear about your wife.

341
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,680
For fuck's sake, Monroe.

342
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Think you wandered in here by mistake?

343
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,760
Deep down, you wanna stay,

344
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,640
because you've been abandoned
by the powers that be.

345
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,840
There's nowhere else to turn. Get
your shoes off and fall back in line.

346
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
Get AIDS,

347
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
or jump on a bus
with a rucksack full of explosives,

348
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
the government will dish you out
a free car,

349
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,040
but keep your head down,
be good and walk without a limp,

350
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
and you get zip.

351
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
That's why you're all here.

352
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,320
You count for nothing.

353
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,480
And your cries fall on deaf ears.
Same as me.

354
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,800
The only difference between us is
I've got the confidence to fight back.

355
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
So how do we fight back?

356
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't know yet.

357
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,760
But if you want to spend your life getting
bullied and raped by cunts like Blair,

358
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,520
and having paedophiles
wander the fucking playgrounds

359
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,560
while you smile mutely
and pay your fucking taxes...

360
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,240
...then get out the door.

361
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
I wanna learn how to fight back.

362
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,480
So do I.

363
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,160
Me too.

364
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,160
Good.

365
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,040
No, you're wrong. You use
the inside of your hand, not your fist.

366
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,240
Smack 'em on the nose, sends the
nose bone straight up into the brain.

367
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,320
That will kill 'em instantly.
Reckon you could do it?

368
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,280
I'd rather let Bryant do it for me.

369
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,680
And that will save you
getting a 23 rec in prison.

370
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,200
How do you prefer to kill people, yeah?
Up close and personal, bare hands,

371
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,880
or sniper rifle, 300 yards, bingo?

372
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,360
I'd rather get you to do it for me.

373
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,800
I'd be happy to.

374
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,520
I'm going to the toilet.
Try not to kill anybody while I'm away.

375
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,040
What did I tell you, eh?
Fucking out-there.

376
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,560
- He's completely insane.
- Maybe. But he speaks sense.

377
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,440
Same again for everyone?

378
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
He's a fucking mug, huh?

379
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,640
If someone killed my family and I found
'em, I'd send 'em a fucking nail bomb.

380
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,440
No, it's a letter bomb.
That's what you'd send.

381
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
Excuse me.

382
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
Why don't you look where you're going,
you black cunt?

383
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Do yourself a favour and fuck off before
you get opened up like a tin of beans.

384
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,920
- What kind of fucking nutter are you?
- Fuck off.

385
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,960
- What happened?
- Nothing. Can we leave?

386
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,400
- What happened?
- I spilt the drinks. I'd like to leave.

387
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,160
- Who started on you?
- It was just some lads.

388
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
They called me a black 'C' and...
Could we just leave?

389
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,520
- Who was it?
- Doesn't matter.

390
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,400
Who is it? Eh?

391
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
It's the one with the dark hair
and blue T-shirt.

392
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,240
- You call my mate a black cunt?
- Who are you, you fucking mug?

393
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
- Wanna make one?
- I'll fucking make one!

394
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,800
- I'll fucking make one.
- Outside, all of you. Five minutes.

395
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,440
We'll fucking be there.
He's gonna go, this cunt.

396
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,520
We're gonna fight 'em.

397
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,920
- Excuse me?
- Come on, this is it.

398
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,120
For fuck's sake, Bryant. No way.

399
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,640
Come on, stand with me.
We can do this. Don't fall away.

400
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,040
This is it. We can do it!

401
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,880
I'm with you, boss.

402
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,360
Right, come on.

403
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,600
Come on.

404
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,880
Now we're talking bollocks.
Watch these smudges up here.

405
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Come here.

406
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,480
- I'm going right through him.
- Come and stand over here.

407
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
Eh? Fucking stand with me.
Fucking stand with me.

408
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,200
You come here cos of them smudges.

409
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,160
Don't you fucking wanna...

410
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,600
Let's go. We're gonna get nicked.

411
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,640
Fucking saucy cunts.
Come on. Let's go.

412
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,400
What?

413
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,400
You fucking know what.

414
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,760
- I was shitting myself.
- So was I.

415
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,320
But at least I stood.

416
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,680
And Lord hold Marcia
underneath your wing.

417
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,040
Guide her with your loving hands

418
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,520
through the passages of heaven.

419
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,520
Amen.

420
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,160
Come here.

421
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,040
Are you religious?

422
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,280
I stopped believing
when I realised no one was listening.

423
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,280
Your lip's swollen.

424
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
I fell.

425
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,360
I've been listening to everything that's
happened over the past few days.

426
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,720
- That's illegal.
- So's what you've been doing.

427
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,400
- Where's Danny Bryant?
- How the hell should I know?

428
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,600
Well, find him and tell him
I wanna meet with him.

429
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,200
Otherwise I'll have you all nicked
for assault.

430
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,760
I thought you were different.

431
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,800
Do you mind if we talk alone?

432
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,720
Para?

433
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,760
I was Engineers. Where did you serve?

434
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,600
Falklands, Afghanistan, Iraq.
What the fuck does it matter?

435
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,480
If you wanna arrest me, get on with it.

436
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,720
Do you mind?

437
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,640
You know, two weeks ago,

438
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
some kids from our street...

439
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,960
They set fire to a 79-year-old woman

440
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,720
because she called the police.

441
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,440
After they tried to rob her, three times.

442
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,280
And do you know what the police said?

443
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,000
Paperwork.

444
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,840
I'm here to help you.

445
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,680
I heard what you said in the sports hall.

446
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,640
I wanna help ya.

447
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,480
I can get you sleeves on all Manning's
people, the ones that hurt Monroe.

448
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,440
The ones that killed his family.

449
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,880
The law failed him.

450
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,520
We won't.

451
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,600
You get that right and I'll
feed you paedophiles, dealers,

452
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,280
bullies, junkies, scum,
cunts, dogs... the lot.

453
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,000
And on top of that,

454
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,400
I'll try and keep you
one step ahead of the law.

455
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
Yeah?

456
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:16,000
This is my job. This is what they gave
me after serving 25 years on the force.

457
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:22,240
I get to drive high-risk
prosecution and collect CCTVs.

458
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,880
You wanna know why?

459
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,840
Because I play it by the fucking book.

460
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,880
You wanna hurt people like Manning,
get the people around him.

461
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,200
What about the people
that attacked Mardell?

462
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,320
You're on.

463
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,640
'Fuck you! You fucking fuck! '

464
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
We're one short tonight, gents.

465
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,400
Not everybody's got the appetite for it.
Glad to see you do.

466
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,080
Now.

467
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,720
I'm gonna walk out that door in a minute.
There is no training tonight.

468
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:26,280
The next time you see me, it'll only be if
you're serious about doing this properly.

469
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,560
About putting something of substance
together. Legitimate targets.

470
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,080
I'm talking about people that hurt you.
I'm talking about fucking violence.

471
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,880
So go home and make a decision.

472
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,640
You're either with me or you're not.

473
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,600
If you are,
I'll be at the hotel at midday tomorrow.

474
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,120
If you're not, forget you ever met me.

475
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,680
That's them.

476
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,320
Two IC1 s heading towards you.
Intercept and wait for me.

477
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,800
How are you, man?

478
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,080
Go on.

479
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,760
Go on.

480
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,480
Enough, Bryant.

481
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,440
Enough!

482
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,160
- Apple bag, please.
- Give me the money and then pick it up.

483
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,680
You work for Terry Manning, don't you?

484
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,360
So what if I fucking do?

485
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,360
- I have a message for him.
- What's that, then?

486
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,040
OK, go! Go! Come on, go!

487
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
Do you live round here?

488
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,360
Two drug dealers left for dead.

489
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,960
This is gang related. We've yet
to study the CCTV footage but...

490
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,080
Move along, just move along.

491
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,440
The investigation's ongoing
so I'd rather not comment further.

492
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,080
Sir, the caretaker called me up.
The monitors are on the blink.

493
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,760
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

494
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,760
And you'd know about that, would you?

495
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,480
You'll find that I did serve five years
in the Royal Engineers.

496
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,480
Indeed you did.

497
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,960
Shall I have another go, sir?

498
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,280
You do what you want, Lewis.

499
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,560
As long as you find out
who did this, huh?

500
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,160
Before you smile, watch this.

501
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,760
Camera 2 picked you all up
making your getaway.

502
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,640
Be careful. I may not be there next time.

503
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,640
Four cameras were watching.
We got two of 'em.

504
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,640
Fortunately, only one of them
matters this time. Now...

505
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,760
These are two more faces
on the Manning payroll.

506
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,560
Tomorrow, they transport laundered
drug money to a safe house.

507
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,160
Cos they had the police in their pocket,
there's no reason for 'em to suspect.

508
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,160
But be careful. Faces like this
don't go down like junkies.

509
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,880
- Isn't it robbery?
- Hit 'em quick and hard. They'll fold.

510
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,560
- What about police traffic?
- I can only do so much.

511
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,960
Give me your fucking keys, now.
Get down on the floor!

512
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,840
Down on the floor. You stay there.

513
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,760
You stay there. Come on!

514
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,880
Get down. Don't you move!

515
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,760
Get on the fucking corner!

516
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,680
- Stay there!
- Get down, you cunt!

517
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,240
Come on!

518
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,360
Keep down! Don't move!

519
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Go, go! Get in! Fucking idiot!

520
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,960
Get in, you fucking idiot!

521
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
Fucking idiot! What did you do?

522
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,280
Me? That black bastard
pushed me out the way.

523
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,760
- Who you calling a black 'B'?
- You, you mug.

524
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,560
You pushed me out of the way.
You fucking mug!

525
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,880
Leave it! Leave it!

526
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,840
- We got something, didn't we?
- Not the point.

527
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,560
You're fucking useless, all of you.

528
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,160
Couldn't take money
when it's sitting on a plate.

529
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,760
I didn't know the police
were gonna be driving by.

530
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,360
Shut up. You're as bad as him.
Like fucking kids.

531
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,560
Extraordinary events
in a London suburb this morning.

532
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,480
What appeared to be a robbery

533
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,240
ended in thieves emptying sacks of cash
over the streets for the public.

534
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,360
'Extraordinary scenes indeed.

535
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,160
'Lt seems that the gang took the money
from known drug dealers

536
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,240
'slit open the bag and then let it go
from the back of their getaway van.

537
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,360
'Eyewitnesses reported that
the masked raiders waved at police

539
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,760
We're famous.

540
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,360
Someone's taking the piss, someone
under our roof. I've got too much to lose.

541
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,560
- Yes, sir. Clearly.
- Talk to the ghosts, see what they have.

542
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,560
Who are these fucking people?

543
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,040
Good afternoon.
We believe we have evidence

544
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,840
linking the robbery to the attempted
murders of the drug dealers this week.

545
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,840
We believe the same gang
is responsible for both crimes.

546
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,880
And we are treating this
as a priority case.

547
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:15,480
We also believe the gang have made
connections within the police force.

548
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,760
We will leave no stone unturned

549
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,760
in our attempts to bring police corruption
to justice.

550
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,960
'These gang members are nothing more
than mindless outlaws.

551
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,760
'And while certain members of the media

552
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,880

you know?

I hate 'em.

There's a few that are gonna get served
one day.

570
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,160
Why stop there?
We can do what we want.

571
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,880
- Know where to draw the line.
- What line?

572
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,480
What are you gonna do? Punch every
traffic warden you come across?

573
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:56,560
No. I'm talking about your nonces and
that. Your Gary Glitters, your grasses.

574
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,680
Sickos, Muslims.
Hang the fucking lot of them.

He'll be the first to fucking go.

I'm a Muslim, Hillier.
Do you want to kill me?

577
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,960
You ain't a Muslim. You're black.

578
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,560
So I'm not allowed to be a Muslim
because I'm black?

579
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,280
Here, boss. What was that thing
you said about suicide bombers?

580
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,160
You don't have to be a Muslim to blow
yourself up. I'm talking individuals.

581
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,160
- You gonna kill the Irish cos of the IRA?
- Yeah, I would.

582
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,760
You're such a Philistine
sometimes, Hillier.

583
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,160
No, I'm British 100%, me.

584
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,160
Listen. I'm here
because my wife and child are dead.

585
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,760
That has nothing to do with race
or religion.

586
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,360
OK?

587
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Get to a landline and call me back
on 02074960209.

588
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,680
- What's wrong?
- I think Greaves is on me.

589
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,560
Don't worry. This is swept.
Listen. I've found the CCTV

590
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,560
from the court toilets with Monroe.

591
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,760
'Your man's called Furlong. Lan Furlong.

Text me his address to Dekker's phone.
Why's he on bail?

594
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,360
Shoplifting crayons, apparently.

595
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,760
CPS document said he was originally
charged with sexually assaulting a minor.

596
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,360
But they buried it, down to his
cooperation with certain police officers.

597
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,240
The geezer's a fucking nonce.
Put him down.

598
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,680
You're a good man, Walter.
Thanks for everything.

599
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,760
Yeah. You too, son.

600
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,560
So where are you from?

601
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,360
You married?

602
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,560
I'm supposed to be getting married soon.

603
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I don't even know if I want to.

604
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,760
Stop talking.

605
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,440
There's the target. Bring the car round
and meet me on that corner.

606
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,360
Oi, Furlong.

607
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,960
Is it not true
that you work for Terry Manning?

608
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,880
And in a bid to bend a jury,

609
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,240
you murdered
the prosecution counsel's wife.

610
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,160
But you did threaten the counsel's
unborn child with murder

611
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,160
if he didn't walk away from the case,
did you not?

612
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,640
And lastly,
were you or were you not cleared

613
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,280
of sexually assaulting a minor

614
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,240
on the grounds of your special
relationships with certain police officers?

615
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,760
Guilty. Kick the barrel away
and let's get the fuck out of here.

616
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,960
For Christ's sake...

617
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,680
You have to stop this. This is murder.

618
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
What about your wife and kid?

619
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,080
- They're not the point.
- What is the point, then, Barrister?

620
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,280
If we do this, we become murderers.

621
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,280
And I don't want any part of that.
How do we know if he really did it?

622
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,560
Cos that's what we think?
Is that proof? Is it?

623
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,160
I do this for a living.

624
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,560
We need real proof.

625
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,440
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

626
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,480
This ain't murder. It's punishment.

627
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,360
Don't you do this.

628
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,760
Do it? That's what we're about.

629
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,640
This is who we are, now.

630
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,680
No!

631
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
Christ, you...

632
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,760
What did you fucking do that for? Eh?

633
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,080
You ain't seen the last of him.

634
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,760
I'm the boss, Hillier.
Don't you ever forget that.

635
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,160
Listen, it's worse than I thought.
Manning's got Greaves in his pocket.

636
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,240
They're doing all sorts together.
Manning will get bailed this week.

637
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,480
The case will collapse. Find him.
He's the one to go for next.

638
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,040
- What about Furlong?
- Fuck Furlong. He's already gone.

639
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,240
It wasn't that easy.

640
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,880
You let him go. For fuck's sake,
you don't know what you've done.

641
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,640
Hang up now.
Yeah, don't call this number again.

642
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,240
I'll contact you.

644
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,760
What you gonna do now... boss?

645
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,360
Fuck off.

646
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,480

647
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,880
Better off without me, is that it?

648
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,960
Yeah, you carry on walking away
when things get tough.

649
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,680
Leave all the real work to me.

650
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,960

started fucking about.

01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,240
Dekker, Monroe. Get out of the car.

677
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,240
- What for?
- Just get out.

678
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,480
They've killed Lewis
and put me in the frame.

679
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,360
They don't know who you are.
You can still walk away.

680
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,160
- What if we don't wanna?
- You should want to.

681
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,240
If they kill their own, you don't stand
a fucking chance. Now walk away.

682
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,560
Dump your phones and start again.

683
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,960
Forget we ever met. Don't make contact
with each other, whatever you do.

684
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,280
Now, go.

685
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,160
- I said walk!
- Where?

686
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,760
You fucking walk away now!

687
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,640
- Now go!
- Why?

688
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,040
I said go! Go on, fuck off!

689
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,080
For your own good. Go on.

690
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,360
This is where you were beaten up.
What do you wanna come here for?

691
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,240
Don't matter.

692
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,480
'My client Terrence Manning
has fought tirelessly to clear his name.

693
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,680
'And can return to being an
upstanding member of his community.

694
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,280
'Mr Manning would like to thank his family
and friends for support throughout,

695
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,160
'in particular his wife Joanna,
who has been his rock.

696
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,840
'Mr Manning would like to thank members
of the press who respected his privacy

697
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,360
'around and about the family home.

698
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,160
'Finally, my client
would like to thank the judge

699
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,560
'for the fairness and justness
of his ruling today. '

700
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,440
We're in the papers again.

701
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,480
Says they nearly had him.
Pinned him down somewhere in Essex

702
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,560
and he slipped the net again.

703
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,280
Do you think they'll catch him?

704
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,880
Did he kill anyone apart from Lewis?

705
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,240
He didn't kill Lewis.
Greaves and Manning did.

706
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,760
You know where Bryant is, don't ya?

707
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,160
Frank? Drop it.

708
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,840
You can make a lot of money with that
information. He's on the wanted list.

709
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,760
- Have you spoke to him?
- Stop fucking driving me mad.

710
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,840
- I'm only asking.
- Where you been, shithead?

711
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,160
Therapy?

712
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,640
It's a shame you lot
never got round to him.

713
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,280
Bryant would have loved
to have dealt with him.

714
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,560
I would have come with you, but it would
have looked weird if we'd both gone.

715
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,360
Hey.

716
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,960
To the groom.

717
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:26,160
- What a fucking way to go out, eh?
- I can think of worse ways.

718
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,040
You know what you were saying
in the office about Manning?

719
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,440
You know my brother Andy?

720
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,560
He knows someone
who does a bit of running about for him.

721
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,760
- Said Manning's lying low in the country.
- Who the fuck have you been talked to?

722
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,760
- I told you earlier, friend. Drop it.
- I haven't spoken to anyone, I swear.

723
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,240
- It's just my brother.
- Where in the countryside?

724
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,160
Dunno. I can find out.

725
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,160
Leave me alone.

726
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,440
# Sometimes it's faded

727
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,760
# Assassinated

728
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,760
# For fear of growing old

729
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,080
# We hang on

730
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,960
# Though we try

731
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,640
# It's gone #

732
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,480
- Manning made bail. Where is he?
- Kill me and you won't fucking know.

733
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,360
Somebody'll talk. They always do.

734
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,080
'He said Manning's lying low
in the country... '

735
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,360
I will.

736
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,760
'The only difference between us is

737
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,280
'I've got the confidence
to fight back. '

738
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,280
Be faithful to her
until death do you part?

739
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
No.

740
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,960
Yes? Yes?

741
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,040
There's a phone call for you, Cedric.

742
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,680
Who is it, Lucy?

743
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,480
He didn't give his name.
He said you'd know who it is.

744
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,360
How are you getting on?

745
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,680
I've been better.

746
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,680
You?

747
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,040
Do you wanna do something?

748
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,360
I know how to get to Manning.

749
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,880
Come on! Get him! Get him!

750
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,880
Come on, get back! Back!

751
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,880
What did I tell you?

752
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,640
- Put the gun down, please.
- What... did I tell you?

753
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,560
- You told us not to make contact.
- For your own good.

754
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,680
What were you talking about
at the restaurant with Monroe?

755
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,480
Somebody say something about
Manning? I heard you say Manning.

756
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,160
Tell me what you know, Dekker.

757
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:35,080
He's in the countryside. I know where.

758
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,960
- How do you know?
- I just do.

759
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,160
What were you planning?

760
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,160
We don't know what else to do
any more.

761
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,680
We'll dump the vehicle and go on foot.
A tree line runs into the garden.

762
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,840
The file says
he drives a black BMW 735i.

763
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,160
And that's our entry sign.

764
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,160
And once we're inside?

765
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Any other questions?

766
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,040
It won't work. What do you think,
he's gonna be waiting for you alone?

767
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,040
Even if you do kill him, they'll find you.

768
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,560
You know where we'll be
if you change your mind.

769
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,880
What about you two?
You've still got lives to go back to.

770
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,040
You could slip under the radar,
forget we ever met.

771
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,960
He's probably right.

772
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,960
Chances are, we won't make it.

773
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,680
Come on.

774
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,040
Something's wrong.

775
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,760
Upstairs.

776
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,640
'Or spend the rest of your lives
getting raped by cunts like Blair?

777
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,560
'Or having paedophiles
wandering the fucking playgrounds

778
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,960
'while you smile mute
and pay your fucking taxes?

779
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,040
'Neither do I.

780
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,360
'I wanna learn how to... '

781
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,160
- Get down on the floor.
- Drop the weapons.

782
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,560
Go! Go!

783
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,640
Come on. Come on.

784
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
Over there. Come on.

785
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,760
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just a surface wound.

786
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,760
I'll live.

787
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,960
- What?
- What were you doing with that gun?

788
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,960
You were closer to hitting me than them.

789
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,960
What? I was the one
who shot the marksman, wasn't I?

790
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,960
Bollocks.
You didn't have your safety catch off.

791
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,960
- Rubbish.
- Rubbish, he says. Eh? Rubbish!

792
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,160
You know, Monroe? You know
something? I've never heard you swear.

793
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,760
Takes a lot of doing
for a man in your shoes.

794
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,480
If we go up that way, we're dead.

795
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,440
Make your targets!

796
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,840
Keep it sharp, lads!

797
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,360
Armed police! Stand still!

798
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,360
Get the murdering little fucker! Stop him!

799
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,560
Do it! Kill him!

800
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,480
Shit.

801
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,280
Thanks, Mr Manning.

802
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,640
You ain't got the bollocks, son.
