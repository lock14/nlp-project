1
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,414
Dora!

2
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:06,927
Fagle!

3
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,256
Fagle!

4
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:11,328
Huh?

5
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:55,087
All right.
Hold still now.

6
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,856
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

7
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,596
Well...
Oh, sorry.

8
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,841
No, thanks.

9
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:48,278
Well, you're in good health.

10
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:50,893
So how's Judith and the kids?

11
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,520
Good.
Everyone's good, you know.

12
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,241
Danny must be, what?
About to be bar mitzvahed?

13
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,489
Two weeks.

14
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,470
Well, mazel tov!

15
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,812
They grow up fast, don't they?

16
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,432
Hmm...

17
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,415
Hmm...

18
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,158
Yeah, you put the...

19
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,239
That's right, you put the...

20
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,260
You following this?

21
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,078
Okay?

22
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:42,477
So...

23
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:45,548
This part is exciting.

24
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,966
So, am I right?

25
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,442
So, okay. So...

26
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,325
So, if that's that,
then we can do this.

27
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,357
And that's SchrÃ¶dinger's Paradox, right?

28
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:58,989
Is the cat dead?

29
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,938
Or is the cat not dead?

30
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,149
Messages, Professor Gopnik.

31
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,596
Thank you, Natalie.

32
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,837
Oh, Clive, come in.

33
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,868
So, what can I do for you?

34
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,297
Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

35
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,374
of the physics midterm were unjust.

36
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,995
Uh-huh? How so?

37
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,240
I received unsatisfactory grade.

38
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,480
In fact, F, the failing grade.

39
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:30,096
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

40
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,692
Yes, but that is not just.

41
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:34,773
I was unaware to be examined
on the mathematics.

42
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:37,871
Well, you can't do physics
without mathematics, really, can you?

43
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,290
If I receive the failing grade,
I lose my scholarship,

44
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,610
and I feel shame.

45
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:46,193
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

46
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,709
But you can't really understand
the physics

47
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,471
without understanding the math.

48
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:55,153
The math tells how it really works.
That's the real thing.

49
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,668
The stories I give you in class
are just illustrative.

50
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,451
They're like fables, say,
to help give you a picture.

51
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,761
I mean...

52
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:07,283
Even I don't understand the dead cat.

53
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:09,171
The math is how it really works.

54
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,514
Very difficult.

55
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:11,998
Very difficult.

56
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,962
Well, I'm sorry, but I...

57
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,085
What do you propose?

58
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,238
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

59
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,447
Or perhaps I can take the midterm again.

60
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,207
I know now it cover the mathematics.

61
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,894
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

62
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,347
If one student gets to retake the test
until he gets a grade he likes?

63
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:28,980
- Secret test.
- No...

64
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,610
- Hush-hush.
- No.

65
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:32,172
That's just not workable.

66
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,148
I'm afraid we'll just have to bite
the bullet on this thing, Clive...

67
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:36,562
Very troubling.

68
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,446
Very troubling.

69
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:53,937
<i>Sy Ableman.</i>

70
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,013
Hello, Sy.
Larry Gopnik.

71
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,803
<i>Larry.
How are you, my friend?</i>

72
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,490
Good.
How you been, Sy?

73
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:03,282
<i>Fine.
Can we talk, Larry?</i>

74
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,974
What? You...
Uh...

75
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,219
<i>Hello? Larry?</i>

76
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,494
Call back!

77
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,677
Clive!

78
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,246
That was Sy Ableman.

79
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,658
He said he got disconnected.

80
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:28,732
<i>Out in a minute.</i>

81
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,894
I gotta wash my hair.
I'm going out tonight.

82
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:31,965
<i>I'll be out in a minute.</i>

83
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,460
Jesus Christ!

84
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,067
Why is Uncle Arthur
always in the bathroom?

85
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,312
He has to drain his sebaceous cyst.
You know that.

86
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:40,413
Will you set the table?

87
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,639
Why can't he do it in the basement
or out in the garage?

88
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,850
I had 20 bucks in it, too.
Inside the case.

89
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,346
Twenty bucks?
How come?

90
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,482
Bought a lid from Mike Fagle
a couple of weeks ago.

91
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:54,604
Still owed him 20.

92
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,269
He already gave you the pot?

93
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,566
Yeah. But a couple of weeks ago,
my funding got cut off.

94
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,291
Fagle said he'd pound the crap out of me
if I didn't pay up.

95
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,528
What funding got cut off?
Where do you get your money?

96
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:05,596
What happened?

97
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,409
Rabbi Turchik took his radio.
Had money in it.

98
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:08,686
That fucker!

99
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,479
Yeah. I think he said
he was confiscating it.

100
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,336
He's a fucker.
Where do you get your money?

101
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:13,865
Mike Fagle's gonna kick his ass.

102
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,338
Last week he pounded the crap out
of Seth Seddlemeyer.

103
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,615
He's a fucker!

104
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,757
- Fagle or Seth Seddlemeyer?
- They're both fuckers!

105
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:21,661
<i>Out in a minute!</i>

106
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:22,763
Are you still in there?

107
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,593
<i>Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!</i>

108
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:49,564
Arthur!

109
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,080
<i>- Yeah?
- Dinner!</i>

110
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:53,134
<i>Okay, out in a minute!</i>

111
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,317
We should wait.

112
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,597
Are you kidding?

113
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:05,296
Mr. Brandt keeps mowing
part of our lawn.

114
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:06,768
Does that matter?

115
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,106
What?

116
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:09,651
Is it important?

117
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:12,368
It's just odd.

118
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:15,086
Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur
staying with us?

119
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,650
Ask your father.

120
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:04,491
Honey.

121
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,490
Honey.

122
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,756
Did you talk to Sy?

123
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,388
Sy?

124
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,195
Sy Ableman.
That's right, he called, but I...

125
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:14,759
- You didn't talk to him?
- No.

126
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,121
You know the problems
that you and I have been having?

127
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,219
Mmm-hmm.

128
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,795
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

129
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:29,036
In short, I think it's time
that we start talking about a divorce.

130
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:35,563
Sy Ableman?

131
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,009
This is not about Sy.

132
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,602
You mentioned Sy!

133
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,682
Don't twist my words, Larry.

134
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:43,210
A divorce? What have I done?
I haven't done anything.

135
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,070
Larry, don't be a child.

136
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:47,788
You haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

137
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,923
Yes! Yes, we haven't done anything.

138
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,864
And I'm probably about to get tenure.

139
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,232
Nevertheless, there have been problems,
as you know...

140
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,567
- Well...
- and things have changed.

141
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,390
And then, Sy Ableman.

142
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:03,086
Sy has come into my life, and I...

143
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:07,083
Come into your... What does that mean?
You barely know him.

144
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,194
Oh, please.
We've known the Ablemans for 15 years, Larry!

145
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,746
Yes, but you said
we hadn't done anything.

146
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,431
I haven't done anything.

147
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:18,347
This is not some flashy fling, Larry.

148
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,134
This is not about woopsy-doopsy.

149
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,556
Sy Ableman?

150
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,441
<i>I'll be out in a minute!</i>

151
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,040
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Look, I didn't know any other way

152
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:30,798
of breaking it to you except to just
tell you and treat you like an adult.

153
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,327
Is that so wrong?

154
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,346
Where do I sleep?

155
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,489
- What?
- Arthur's on the couch.

156
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,121
Look, Sy feels that we should...

157
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,528
Esther is barely cold!

158
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,449
Esther died three years ago,

159
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,848
and it was a loveless marriage.

160
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:47,888
Sy wants a get.

161
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,391
- A what?
- A ritual divorce.

162
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,025
He says it's very important.

163
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,031
Without a gett, I'm an aguna.

164
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,184
A what?

165
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,785
What are you talking about?

166
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,192
You always act so surprised.

167
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,678
I have begged you to see the Rabbi.

168
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,375
Messages, Professor Gopnik.

169
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,826
Yes, thanks for coming, Clive.
Have a seat.

170
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:01,871
We had, I think,
a good talk the other day,

171
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:04,871
- but you left something...
- I didn't leave it.

172
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:09,483
Well, you don't even know
what I was going to say.

173
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:10,926
I didn't leave anything.

174
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:12,367
I'm not missing anything.

175
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,155
I know where everything is.

176
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:18,188
Well then, Clive...

177
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:20,549
Where did this come from?

178
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,183
This is here, isn't it?

179
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,046
Yes, sir.
That is there.

180
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,160
This is not nothing.

181
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:30,509
This is something.

182
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,230
Yes. That is something.

183
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,520
- What is it?
- You know what it is, I believe.

184
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,041
- And you know I can't keep it, Clive.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:41,934
I'll have to pass it on
to Professor Finkle,

186
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:44,683
along with my suspicions
about where it came from.

187
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,476
Actions have consequences.

188
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:47,576
Yes. Often.

189
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,967
No, always!
Actions always have consequences!

190
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,815
In this office,
actions have consequences.

191
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,507
- Yes, sir.
- Not just physics,

192
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,786
- morally.
- Yes.

193
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,547
And we both know
about your actions.

194
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,536
No, sir.
I know about my actions.

195
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:03,080
I can interpret, Clive.
I know what you meant me to understand.

196
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:04,712
Meer sir my sir.

197
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,935
"Meer sir my sir"?

198
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,230
Mere surmise, sir.

199
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,622
Very uncertain.

200
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:48,682
You little brat fucker!

201
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,791
You snuck 20 bucks
out of my drawer!

202
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,875
Studying Torah, asshole.

203
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:54,830
You little brat!
I'm telling Dad!

204
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,192
You gonna tell him you've been
sneaking it out of his wallet?

205
00:23:57,296 --> 00:24:00,362
You know what I'm gonna do, you little brat,
if you don't give it back?

206
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,281
Dad?

207
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,843
Dad, you've gotta fix the aerial.

208
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,820
Hello, Larry.
Have you thought about a lawyer?

209
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,172
- Dad!
- Honey, please!

210
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,287
We're not getting
channel four at all.

211
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,604
Can we discuss it later?

212
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:11,784
I can't get F Troop.

213
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,163
Larry, the children know.

214
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:14,573
Do you think this is some secret?

215
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:16,101
Do you think this is something
we're going to keep quiet?

216
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,701
Dad, Uncle Arthur
is in the bathroom again,

217
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:18,920
and I'm going to the Hole at 8:00.

218
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,201
<i>- Out in a minute!
- Ow! Stop!</i>

219
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:22,181
- She keeps doing that!
- What's going on?

220
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:50,888
Arthur?

221
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:52,278
Yes?

222
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,958
What are you doing?

223
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:59,365
Working on the Mentaculus.

224
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,886
Any luck, um,

225
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,884
looking for an apartment?

226
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,095
No.

227
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:29,386
- Sy.
- Good to see you, Larry.

228
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,151
I'll get Judith.

229
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:35,949
No, listen, actually,
I'm here to see you, if I might.

230
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:39,369
Such a thing.
Such a thing.

231
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,439
Shall we go in the kitchen?

232
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:45,066
You know, Larry, the way
we handle ourselves in this situation,

233
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,242
so important.

234
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:48,969
- Uh-huh?
- Absolutely.

235
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:50,500
Judith told me that
she broke the news to you,

236
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:53,509
and she said that
you were very adult.

237
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,405
- Did she?
- Absolutely.

238
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:57,767
The respect she has for you...

239
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,265
- Yes?
- Do you drink wine?

240
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:01,799
Because this is
an incredible bottle.

241
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,080
This is not Mogen David, Larry.

242
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:05,769
This is a wine. A Bordeaux.

243
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,398
- You know, Sy...
- Open it.

244
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,958
Let it breathe.
Ten minutes.

245
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,397
Letting it breathe, so important.

246
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:14,184
Thanks, Sy, but I'm not...

247
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,674
Listen, I insist, Larry.
There's no cause for discomfort.

248
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,724
I'd be uncomfortable
if you didn't take it.

249
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,837
Larry, listen.
These are signs.

250
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,119
Tokens, Larry.

251
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,531
I'm just...
I'm not ungrateful.

252
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:24,808
I just don't know
a lot about wine,

253
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,339
- and given our...
- It's okay.

254
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:28,999
- respective...
- It's okay.

255
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:34,467
Larry, we're going to be fine.

256
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,307
Want some of this, fucker?

257
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:15,779
Fuck.

258
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,001
Would you read this?
Tell me what you think?

259
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:24,898
Okay.

260
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:29,125
Boy! You should have worn a hat.

261
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:53,481
Let's see some hustle, Mitch.

262
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:38,626
Larry?

263
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,032
Hi, Arlen.

264
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:46,596
Larry, I feel that as head of
the tenure committee, I should tell you this.

265
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:52,170
Though it should be no cause for concern,
and you should not at all be worried.

266
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:53,522
Okay.

267
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:56,031
But I feel I should mention it,

268
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:59,903
even though it will carry
no weight in our decision

269
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,505
on whether or not
to grant you tenure.

270
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,163
So again, no cause for concern.

271
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,568
Okay, Arlen.
Give what any weight?

272
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,064
Well...

273
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,136
We've received a number of letters

274
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,036
denigrating you
and urging us not to...

275
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,699
Not to grant you tenure.

276
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:21,426
From who?

277
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,832
Well, they're anonymous,
so we dismiss them completely.

278
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:27,209
Well, what do they say?

279
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:29,699
Well, they make allegations...

280
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,743
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

281
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,559
And though we give them
no credence at all, Larry.

282
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:37,790
Well, I'm not really at liberty

283
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:40,354
to discuss the specifics
of the committee's deliberations.

284
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:44,003
But I think you're saying these won't play
any part in your deliberations?

285
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:45,317
None whatsoever.

286
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:46,385
So what are they?

287
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,125
Moral turpitude, you could say.

288
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,123
Uh-huh. Can I ask?
Are they...

289
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,096
- Are they idiomatic?
- Hmm?

290
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:59,846
The reason I ask, I have
a Korean student. South Korean.

291
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,623
A disgruntled South Korean,
and I meant to talk to you about this...

292
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:08,674
Oh, no, no. They're competently,
even eloquently written.

293
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:12,192
A native English speaker.
There's no question about that.

294
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,567
- Uh-huh.
- Let me reiterate.

295
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,040
No cause for concern.

296
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:20,742
I only speak because
I would feel odd concealing it.

297
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,402
- Yes.
- Yeah.

298
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,375
Best to Judith.

299
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,182
I gotta get my radio back.

300
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,386
Maybe the fucker lodged it
up his fucking asshole.

301
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,685
I gotta get it back, or Mike Fagle's
gonna pound the crap out of me.

302
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,160
Way up his asshole.

303
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:55,936
Good afternoon.

304
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:00,848
Go scrub up, Mitch.

305
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:03,872
Been hunting?

306
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:11,559
Is that a...

307
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,998
It's gonna be a boat shed.

308
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:14,307
Uh-huh.

309
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,409
That's great.

310
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:19,239
- Mr. Brandt...
- I said scrub up, Mitch!

311
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,318
Isn't this a school day?

312
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:27,360
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

313
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,260
Uh, Mr. Brandt,

314
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,248
that's just about
at the property line there.

315
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:35,621
I don't think we're supposed to get

316
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,280
- within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

317
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:40,643
- The...
- Poplar.

318
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,842
- Well, even if it is, you're just about over it.
- Measure.

319
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:46,791
- I don't have to measure, you can tell it's...
- Line's the poplar.

320
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,184
What's going on?

321
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:50,608
Nothing.

322
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,916
- Larry?
- Yeah?

323
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:56,512
Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz?

324
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,632
No, I...
Not yet.

325
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:58,719
Larry.

326
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,001
Appointment Monday.

327
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:01,315
Where are you going?

328
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,594
I'm going to the Hole.

329
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:04,190
What? At 5:00?

330
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:06,652
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house
so I can wash my hair.

331
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,239
Hi, Mr. Gopnik.

332
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:10,657
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

333
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,255
<i>I'll be out in a minute!</i>

334
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,375
- Are you ready?
- Huh?

335
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,909
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

336
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:17,221
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

337
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,322
Larry.

338
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,534
How are you?

339
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,271
Sy.

340
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,728
Hello, Judith.

341
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:32,784
Hello, Sy.

342
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:37,987
Larry, I want to thank you for coming.

343
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,663
It's so important that we be able
to discuss these things.

344
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,393
I'm happy to come to Embers, Sy.

345
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,853
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

346
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,237
these discussions to the lawyers.

347
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:50,021
Of course. Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

348
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,030
You don't mix apples and oranges.

349
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:53,478
I have begged you to see the lawyer.

350
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:54,753
I told you, I'm going Monday.

351
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,376
Monday is timely.
This is not...

352
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,992
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities. You're so right.

353
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:05,532
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

354
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,677
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

355
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:12,675
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

356
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:13,856
Living arrangements?

357
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:18,081
I think we all agree
that the children

358
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:21,119
not being contaminated
with the tension,

359
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:22,271
the most important.

360
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,253
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

361
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
The kids aren't...

362
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,268
I'm saying "we".
I'm not pointing fingers.

363
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,952
No one is playing the blame game, Larry.

364
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,070
I didn't say anyone was.

365
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:33,030
Well, let's not play
"He said. She Said," either.

366
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,068
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

367
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:38,755
Let's just take a step back
and we can diffuse the situation.

368
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,222
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

369
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,920
if I count to 10...

370
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:48,797
One,

371
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,023
two,

372
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:53,436
three,

373
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,001
four...

374
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,179
Or silently.

375
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,871
Really, to keep things
on an even keel

376
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:09,764
leading up to Danny's bar mitzvah...

377
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,554
A child's bar mitzvah, Larry.

378
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:15,201
Sy and I think it's best
if you move out of the house.

379
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:17,487
Move out?

380
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:19,876
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

381
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:21,349
Move out?
Where would I go?

382
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,382
Well, for instance,
the Jolly Roger is quite livable.

383
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:25,697
It's not expensive.

384
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:28,253
The rooms are eminently habitable.

385
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:29,788
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

386
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:31,869
There's convenience in its favor.
They've got a pool.

387
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:34,496
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

388
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:37,438
Larry.

389
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,831
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

390
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:44,514
I think, really, the Jolly Roger

391
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,516
is the appropriate course of action.

392
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:53,789
Listen here,

393
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:55,454
you little fucker,
I want my money!

394
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,800
Stop it!
I'm gonna get it!

395
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:57,806
Give it back!

396
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,422
You owe me 20 bucks,
you little shit!

397
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:01,380
- Don't worry about it!
- Give it, brat fucker!

398
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,876
- I'm gonna get it! I'm gonna get it!
- Brat! Fucker!

399
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:05,534
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

400
00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,757
- What was that?
- Nothing.

401
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,378
How's the Torah portion coming?

402
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:14,755
Can you maybe use the hi-fi?

403
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:16,032
- What?
- Can I borrow this?

404
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:19,844
I'm taking some stuff to,
you know, the Jolly Roger.

405
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:20,989
- Dad!
- Sure, Dad.

406
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:22,972
Dad! Chinese guy!

407
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:24,476
Culture clash.

408
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:28,222
Culture clash.

409
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:32,166
With all respect, Mr. Park,
I don't think it's that.

410
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,474
- Yes.
- No,

411
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,989
it would be a culture clash
if it were the custom in your land

412
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,436
to bribe people for grades.

413
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,581
Yes.

414
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,134
So, you're saying it is the custom?

415
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,402
No, this is defamation.
Ground for lawsuit.

416
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:48,028
Let me get this straight.

417
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,590
You're threatening to sue me
for defaming your son?

418
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,742
Yes.

419
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:54,496
- But it would...
- Is this man bothering you?

420
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:58,304
Is he bothering me?
No.

421
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:01,376
I, uh...

422
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:08,737
See, look...

423
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:10,431
If it were defamation,
there would have to be

424
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:12,509
someone I was defaming him to, or I...

425
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,556
All right, let's keep it simple.

426
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,925
I could pretend the money never appeared.
That's not defaming anyone.

427
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,257
Yes. And passing grade.

428
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,461
- Passing grade?
- Yes.

429
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,956
Or you'll sue me?

430
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,108
For taking money.

431
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,871
So he did leave the money?

432
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,150
This is defamation!

433
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:33,309
It doesn't make sense.
Either he left the money or he didn't.

434
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:35,617
Please.
Accept the mystery.

435
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,576
Give me that, fucker.

436
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,800
He's very good with numbers.

437
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,097
I think his social skills
have held him back.

438
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:54,106
Such a sweet man, though.

439
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:55,425
Arthur has a good heart.

440
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:58,786
And he never complains, unlike me.

441
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,635
Sometimes I don't give him
enough credit.

442
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:05,313
He tried to tell me about this thing
he's working on, this...

443
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,137
The Mentaculus.

444
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,210
He says it's a probability map
of the universe.

445
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:16,416
Does he go out socially at all?

446
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:20,344
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

447
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,704
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

448
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,231
How is Judith?

449
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:31,869
Fine. She's fine.

450
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:36,516
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

451
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,322
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

452
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,657
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

453
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,824
It was a bolt from the blue.

454
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:47,070
What does that mean?

455
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,751
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

456
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:56,222
Then, it's an opportunity to learn
how things really are.

457
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,882
I don't mean to sound glib.

458
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:04,733
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

459
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:08,318
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

460
00:41:09,764 --> 00:41:10,974
We're Jews.

461
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,202
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

462
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,429
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

463
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,077
that have been handed down
from people who had the same problems.

464
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,945
Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner?

465
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,539
Why not see him?

466
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:32,157
What's the Rabbi gonna tell me?

467
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:34,172
If I knew, I'd be the Rabbi.

468
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,079
The air out here is magnificent.

469
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,452
I'm telling you,
if someone could bottle this air,

470
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:45,278
they'd make a million dollars.

471
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,202
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

472
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:04,577
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

473
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,900
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

474
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,010
He was called away
on an etz monim.

475
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:13,661
Ruth Brynn's mother is in the hospital
and she isn't doing well.

476
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:16,893
Rabbi Nachtner asked me
to cover for him. Come on in.

477
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,360
And she wants a gett.

478
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,210
A what?

479
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,503
- She wants a...
- Oh, a gett.

480
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,097
Uh-huh. Sure.

481
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:46,429
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

482
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,670
I don't know which end is up.

483
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,461
I'm not even sure how to react.

484
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:51,840
I'm too confused.

485
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,773
What reasons did she give
for the rupture?

486
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,329
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

487
00:42:58,434 --> 00:43:00,572
you know,
things haven't been going well.

488
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:01,690
And is that true?

489
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,768
I guess.
I don't know.

490
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,947
She's usually right
about these things.

491
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,385
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

492
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,809
That he would...
He would... Yes?

493
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:13,052
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

494
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:14,907
No offense.

495
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:18,012
No, of course not.
I am the junior rabbi.

496
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:22,271
And it's true, the point of view
of somebody who's older

497
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:26,594
and perhaps had similar problems
might be more valid.

498
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:29,594
And you should see the senior rabbi
as well, by all means.

499
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:30,811
Or even Marshak,

500
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:32,989
if you can get in.

501
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:35,545
He's quite busy, but maybe...

502
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:41,175
Can I share something with you?

503
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:44,320
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

504
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,070
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

505
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:50,269
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

506
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,313
and when that happens, you think,

507
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:56,215
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone".

508
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,009
But that's not the case.

509
00:43:58,498 --> 00:44:01,367
You just need to remember
how to see him.

510
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,679
Am I right? I mean...

511
00:44:04,737 --> 00:44:06,648
The parking lot here.

512
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:10,913
Not much to see.

513
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,108
But if you imagine yourself
a visitor,

514
00:44:14,914 --> 00:44:18,657
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

515
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,210
somebody still
with the capacity for wonder.

516
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:24,347
Someone with a fresh perspective.

517
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:26,141
That's what it is, Larry.

518
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:28,184
Because with the right perspective,

519
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:31,574
you can see Hashem, you know,
reaching into the world.

520
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,300
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

521
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:39,681
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

522
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:41,601
through tired eyes.

523
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:45,690
It sounds like she's become
a sort of thing...

524
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,862
A problem.

525
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,465
A thing.

526
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:51,577
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

527
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,949
- Oh.
- They're planning...

528
00:44:58,018 --> 00:44:59,425
That's why they want the gett.

529
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:01,661
Oh, I'm sorry.

530
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,222
It was his idea.

531
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:08,512
Well, they do need a gett
to remarry in the faith.

532
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,567
But...
This is life.

533
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,213
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

534
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,135
You don't have to like it,
of course.

535
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,789
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

536
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:23,581
That's right!

537
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:25,338
Things aren't so bad.

538
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:27,612
Look at the parking lot, Larry.

539
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:31,356
Just look at that parking lot.

540
00:45:46,753 --> 00:45:47,931
Are we eating already?

541
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,375
Sarah's going out.

542
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:51,260
Ow! Cut it out!

543
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,539
What's going on?

544
00:45:58,592 --> 00:45:59,592
Isn't Dad eating?

545
00:45:59,617 --> 00:46:00,893
He's at the Jolly Roger.

546
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,099
Oh, yeah.

547
00:46:08,257 --> 00:46:09,304
How are you, Larry?

548
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:11,766
Jesus, I am so sorry

549
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,293
- to be seeing you under these circumstances.
- Oh, well...

550
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,856
I always thought you and Judy
were rock solid.

551
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,059
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

552
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,469
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

553
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:24,952
it's an opportunity for me
to really sit down and figure things out

554
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:29,115
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

555
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:32,958
settling for the routine,
tired old way of looking at things.

556
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:35,737
Really?

557
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:38,400
I don't know, maybe not.

558
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:43,197
Well, legally, I have to warn you,

559
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:45,632
it's never easy for the husband.

560
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:48,413
Unless, of course,
there's some question

561
00:46:48,512 --> 00:46:52,570
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

562
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:54,614
Oh, no, no.
Nothing like that.

563
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:57,175
Although she is planning to marry
Sy Ableman, but they...

564
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,588
Sy Ableman!

565
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:02,583
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

566
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,637
She passed three years ago.

567
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:08,730
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

568
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:10,494
Sy Ableman.

569
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:13,275
Not in the sense that...
There hasn't been hanky-panky.

570
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:14,391
To my knowledge.

571
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:17,626
- Oh?
- No I'm fairly certain this is not an issue.

572
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:20,730
And in fact, Judith wants a gett.

573
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,246
A what?

574
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,804
A ritual divorce.

575
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,952
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

576
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,195
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

577
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:33,206
Well, not really a legal issue.

578
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:36,251
Okay, um...

579
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,068
Good. Good.

580
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,465
Well...

581
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:44,831
On the other thing,
the neighbor's property line,

582
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:47,416
I've asked Solomon Schlutz
to take a look.

583
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,748
There's very little to do
with real estate that'll get by Sol.

584
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:52,507
Okay. Good.
How do you...

585
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,005
I guess I'm a little worried.

586
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:56,184
How do you...
I have money pressures...

587
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:58,262
Our fee structure?
We bill by the hour.

588
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:01,467
Dave Sieglestein and
Solomon Schlutz bill at 110.

589
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:04,251
The associates, me,
for instance, bill at...

590
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,719
Call for Mr. Gopnik.
Danny at home.

591
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,726
You can take it here.

592
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:11,896
0809.

593
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:14,759
Danny?

594
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:16,344
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Are you all right?</i>

595
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:17,416
Are you all...

596
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:18,780
<i>F Troop is fuzzy.</i>

597
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:21,786
What?

598
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,545
<i>F Troop is still fuzzy.</i>

599
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:28,092
<i>- Dad?
- Is everything okay?</i>

600
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,293
Clive?

601
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:56,389
Clive!

602
00:49:58,143 --> 00:50:00,826
You little bastard!
You gonna send your mother next?

603
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:04,570
Little bastard!
I want to see you!

604
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,054
Hold on.

605
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:16,373
Professor Gopnik,
it's Dick Dutton again.

606
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,164
Dick Dutton.

607
00:50:20,157 --> 00:50:21,157
Hello?

608
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:22,708
<i>Hello, Mr. Gopnik?</i>

609
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:25,367
<i>This is Dick Dutton
from the Columbia Record Club.</i>

610
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,371
<i>I'm calling because
it's now four months,</i>

611
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:30,746
<i>and we have yet to receive
your first payment.</i>

612
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,579
There's some mistake.

613
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:36,891
I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

614
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:40,536
<i>Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?</i>

615
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,262
No, I live at the Jolly Roger.

616
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,380
<i>Excuse me?</i>

617
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,273
No, I...

618
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:48,215
Well, yes, okay.

619
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:50,139
<i>- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.</i>

620
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:51,827
<i>"Okay" means...</i>

621
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:54,074
Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

622
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:56,989
<i>Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,</i>

623
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,469
<i>and you've been receiving the monthly
main selection for four months now...</i>

624
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,103
The monthly main selection?
Is that a record?

625
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,864
I didn't ask for any records.

626
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:06,967
<i>To receive the monthly main selection,
you do nothing. You...</i>

627
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:08,579
That's right.
I haven't done anything.

628
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:11,237
<i>Yes, that's why you received
the monthly main selection.</i>

629
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:15,878
<i>- But...
- The last one was Santana Abraxas. You...</i>

630
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:19,264
I didn't ask for Santana Abraxas.

631
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,380
<i>You request the main selection</i>

632
00:51:21,485 --> 00:51:23,873
<i>at the retail price by doing nothing.</i>

633
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,804
<i>It's automatically mailed to you,</i>

634
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,297
<i>plus shipping and handling.</i>

635
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:30,121
<i>- You're about to receive...
- I can't afford a new record every month!</i>

636
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:31,530
I haven't asked...

637
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:34,443
<i>You're about to get Cosmo's Factory, sir.</i>

638
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,036
<i>The June main selection.</i>

639
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,476
Look, look,
something is very wrong!

640
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:40,677
I don't want Santana Abraxas.

641
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,820
I've just been in a
terrible auto accident.

642
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:47,940
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

643
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:53,001
Well, thank you.
But I...

644
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:54,867
<i>Are you okay?</i>

645
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:59,724
Yes, yes.
No one was hurt.

646
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:03,297
<i>Okay. Good.</i>

647
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:08,516
<i>Well, you had 14 days
to listen to Santana Abraxas.</i>

648
00:52:08,588 --> 00:52:09,603
- Sir?
- Look...

649
00:52:09,677 --> 00:52:12,262
I didn't ask for Santana Abraxas,

650
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:15,713
I didn't listen to Santana Abraxas,

651
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:17,643
I didn't do anything!

652
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,563
<i>- Sir! Your son.
- Mr. Gopnik...</i>

653
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:21,003
He says it's urgent.

654
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:22,311
<i>We can't make you listen
to the record...</i>

655
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:24,005
<i>- Okay, okay, okay...
- We provide...</i>

656
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:25,483
Okay, I have to call you back.

657
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:27,239
<i>- This is... I'm sorry.
- No, no, Mr. Gopnik, please...</i>

658
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:28,802
<i>- Danny?
- Yeah. Listen, Dad...</i>

659
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,501
Did you join the Columbia Record Club?

660
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,021
<i>- Danny?
- Um...</i>

661
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:37,222
Danny, this is completely unacceptable.
I can't afford to...

662
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:38,949
<i>Okay, Dad, but you gotta come home.</i>

663
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:41,606
Is it F Troop?

664
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,530
<i>No, Mom's real upset.</i>

665
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:57,155
- Dad?
- Yes?

666
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,114
Does this mean I can't go
to the Hole tonight?

667
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,034
Does... what mean?
What happened?

668
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:03,367
Oh, Sy Ableman,
he died in a car crash.

669
00:53:03,436 --> 00:53:04,436
Hey, Dad.

670
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:05,844
What?

671
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,273
So you're coming back home?

672
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:09,315
Can you fix the aerial?

673
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:10,402
What?

674
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:12,514
It's still, you know...

675
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,588
She seems to be asking an awful lot.

676
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:51,210
But then... I don't know.

677
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:53,699
Somebody has to pay for Sy's funeral.

678
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:55,617
Uh-huh.

679
00:53:55,628 --> 00:53:57,001
His own estate is in probate,

680
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,822
but why does it have to be me?

681
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:00,963
Or is it wrong to complain?

682
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:02,664
Judy says it is.

683
00:54:03,275 --> 00:54:05,161
But I'm so strapped for cash right now,

684
00:54:05,226 --> 00:54:08,041
carrying the mortgage,
and paying for the Jolly Roger,

685
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:11,402
and I wrecked the car,
and Danny's bar mitzvah coming up, I...

686
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:14,184
Something like this,
there's never a good time.

687
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:17,478
I don't know where it all leaves me.

688
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:18,626
Sy's death.

689
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:22,945
Obviously, it's not going
to go back like it was.

690
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,050
Mmm.

691
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:25,929
- Would you even want that, Larry?
- No, I...

692
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:29,289
Well, yeah.
Sometimes.

693
00:54:29,963 --> 00:54:30,963
Or...

694
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:33,510
I don't know.
I guess

695
00:54:34,123 --> 00:54:36,489
the honest answer is,
I don't know.

696
00:54:36,554 --> 00:54:39,849
What was my life before?
Not what I thought it was.

697
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:41,956
So what does it all mean?

698
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:44,262
What is Hashem trying to tell me,

699
00:54:44,362 --> 00:54:46,599
making me pay for Sy Ableman's funeral?

700
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:47,876
- Mmm.
- And did I tell you

701
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:50,760
I had a car accident
the same time Sy had his?

702
00:54:50,826 --> 00:54:53,030
- The same instant, for all I know.
- Mmm.

703
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,708
Is Hashem trying to tell me
that Sy Ableman is me?

704
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:59,583
Or that we are all one or something?

705
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:02,563
How does God speak to us?

706
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,737
It's a good question.

707
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:06,786
You know Lee Sussman.

708
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,472
Dr Sussman?
I think I... Yeah.

709
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,425
Did he ever tell you
about the goy's teeth?

710
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:14,976
No Uh, what goy?

711
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:18,081
So, Lee is at work one day.

712
00:55:18,505 --> 00:55:21,505
<i>You know, he has the orthodontic practice
there at Great Bear.</i>

713
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,518
<i>He's making a plaster mold.</i>

714
00:55:24,585 --> 00:55:28,034
<i>It's for corrective bridgework
in the mouth of one of his patents,</i>

715
00:55:28,106 --> 00:55:29,534
Russell Krauss.

716
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:43,045
<i>The mold dries,
and Lee is examining it one day</i>

717
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,382
<i>before fabricating an appliance.</i>

718
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,106
<i>He notices something unusual.</i>

719
00:55:50,282 --> 00:55:52,965
<i>There appears to be
something engraved</i>

720
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:55,782
<i>on the inside of the
patentÂs lower incisors.</i>

721
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:06,782
<i>Hey vav shin yud ayin nun yud.</i>

722
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:10,280
<i>Ho-she-ay-ni.</i>

723
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,581
<i>"Help me. Save me".</i>

724
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,978
This, in a goy's mouth, Larry.

725
00:56:21,768 --> 00:56:23,362
<i>He calls the goy back</i>

726
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:26,597
<i>on the pretense of needling
additional measurements for the appliance.</i>

727
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:28,099
<i>"How are you?</i>

728
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:31,081
<i>"Noticed any other problems
with your teeth?"</i>

729
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:34,161
<i>"No".</i>

730
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:42,722
<i>There it is.</i>

731
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:44,800
<i>Ho-she-ay-ni.</i>

732
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:45,873
<i>"Help me".</i>

733
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:47,793
<i>Son of a gun.</i>

734
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:52,262
<i>Sussman goes home.</i>

735
00:56:53,128 --> 00:56:54,818
<i>Can Sussman eat?
Sussman can't eat.</i>

736
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:58,023
<i>Can Sussman sleep?
Sussman can't sleep.</i>

737
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:06,311
<i>Sussman looks at the molds
of his other patents,</i>

738
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:07,619
<i>goy and Jew alike,</i>

739
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:09,695
<i>seeking other messages.
He finds none.</i>

740
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,193
<i>He looks In his own mouth.</i>

741
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:13,809
<i>Nothing.</i>

742
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,487
<i>He looks in his wife's mouth.</i>

743
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,880
<i>Nothing.</i>

744
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:25,793
But Sussman is an educated man.

745
00:57:26,184 --> 00:57:27,777
Not the world's greatest sage, maybe.

746
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,059
No Rabbi Marshak.

747
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:32,253
<i>But he knows a thing or two
about the Zohar and the Kabbalah.</i>

748
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,590
<i>He knows that every Hebrew letter
has its numeric equivalent.</i>

749
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:38,438
<i>8-4-5-4-4-7-3</i>

750
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:40,740
<i>Seven digits.
A phone number, maybe?</i>

751
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,240
<i>"Hello? Do you know a goy
named Krauss, Russell Krauss?"</i>

752
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:47,313
<i>"Who?"</i>

753
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,545
<i>"Where have I called?</i>

754
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:52,094
<i>"The Red Owl in Bloomington?
Thanks so much".</i>

755
00:57:56,585 --> 00:57:57,697
<i>He goes.</i>

756
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:03,197
<i>It's a Red Owl.
Groceries, what have you.</i>

757
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,967
<i>Sussman goes home.
What does it mean?</i>

758
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:12,231
<i>He has to find out
if he is ever to sleep again.</i>

759
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:14,181
<i>He goes to see...</i>

760
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,831
the Rabbi Nachtner.

761
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:19,686
<i>He comes In, he sits right
where you're sitting, right now.</i>

762
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,668
<i>"What does it mean, Rabbi?</i>

763
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:25,190
<i>"Is it a sign from Hashem?
Help me.</i>

764
00:58:25,288 --> 00:58:27,742
<i>"I, Sussman, should be doing something
to help this goy.</i>

765
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:29,856
<i>"Doing what?
The teeth don't say.</i>

766
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,440
<i>"Or maybe I'm supposed to help people
generally lead a more righteous life?</i>

767
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:36,989
<i>"Is the answer in Kabbalah?
In Torah?</i>

768
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:39,619
<i>"Or is there even a question?</i>

769
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,932
<i>"Tell me, Rabbi, what can such a sign</i>

770
00:58:44,264 --> 00:58:45,442
"mean?"

771
00:58:53,192 --> 00:58:54,467
So? What did you tell him?

772
00:58:55,943 --> 00:58:56,943
Sussman?

773
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,338
Yes.

774
00:58:58,438 --> 00:59:00,512
Is it relevant?

775
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,012
Well, isn't that why you're telling me?

776
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,934
Okay.

777
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:06,590
Nachtner says, "Look.

778
00:59:06,664 --> 00:59:08,355
<i>"The teeth, we don't know.</i>

779
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:10,594
"A sign from Hashem?
Don't know.

780
00:59:10,983 --> 00:59:11,983
"Helping others?

781
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:14,335
"Couldn't hurt".

782
00:59:18,023 --> 00:59:20,577
No, no, but who put it there?

783
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:24,639
Was it for him, Sussman? Or for whoever
found it? Or for just... For, for...

784
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,920
We can't know everything.

785
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,681
It sounds like you don't know anything!

786
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:29,059
Why even tell me the story?

787
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:31,771
First I should tell you,
then I shouldn't.

788
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:35,844
What happened to Sussman?

789
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,139
What would happen?
Not much.

790
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:39,293
<i>He went back to work.</i>

791
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:42,498
<i>For a while, he checked every
patentÂs teeth for new messages.</i>

792
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:43,710
<i>He didnÂt find any.</i>

793
00:59:43,782 --> 00:59:45,693
<i>In time, he found he stopped checking.</i>

794
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:48,827
<i>He returned to life.</i>

795
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,940
These questions that are
bothering you, Larry,

796
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:58,492
maybe they're like a toothache.

797
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:02,139
Feel them for a while,
then they go away.

798
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,119
I don't want it to just go away!
I want an answer!

799
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,978
Sure. We all want the answer.

800
01:00:07,943 --> 01:00:09,699
Hashem doesn't owe us the answer, Larry.

801
01:00:10,182 --> 01:00:11,873
Hashem doesn't owe us anything.

802
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:13,853
The obligation runs the other way.

803
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,675
Why does he make us feel the questions

804
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,045
if he's not going
to give us any answers?

805
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:22,432
He hasn't told me.

806
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,492
And what happened to the goy?

807
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:31,918
The goy?

808
01:00:33,702 --> 01:00:34,702
Who cares?

809
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,445
<i>Sy Ableman was a serious man.</i>

810
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:43,295
Sy Ableman was a man
devoted to his community.

811
01:00:43,942 --> 01:00:47,259
To Torah study.
To his beloved wife, Esther,

812
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:50,465
until three years ago she passed,

813
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:53,021
and to his duty, as he saw it.

814
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,384
Where does such a man go?

815
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:01,541
A tzadik. Who knows,
maybe even a lamed vavnik.

816
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:03,548
A man beloved by all.

817
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:05,923
A man who despised the frivolous.

818
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:09,186
Could such a serious man simply

819
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:11,342
disappear?

820
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:15,612
We speak of olam ha-ba,
the world to come.

821
01:01:16,197 --> 01:01:17,197
Not heaven.

822
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,992
Not what the gentiles think of
as afterlife.

823
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:24,358
"Olam ha-ba".
What is olam ha-ba?

824
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:28,829
Where is olam ha-ba?

825
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:34,402
Well, it is not
a geographic place, certainly.

826
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:36,958
Like Canada.

827
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,485
Nor is it the
Eretz zavat chalav udvash,

828
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,143
the land flowing with milk and honey.

829
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:45,213
For we are not promised
a personal reward.

830
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:47,300
A gold star.

831
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:51,773
A first-class VIP lounge where we
get milk and cookies to eternity.

832
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:56,994
Olam ha-ba is
in the bosom of Abraham.

833
01:02:01,925 --> 01:02:03,038
Arthur Gopnik?

834
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:06,106
Are you Arthur Gopnik?

835
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,371
I'm Lawrence Gopnik.

836
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,298
Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik?

837
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:12,804
No.

838
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,112
Is that Arthur Gopnik?

839
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:20,639
Can you tell me what's going on?
We're sitting shiva here.

840
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,757
You're what?

841
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:24,193
A religious observance.

842
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,268
We're bereaved.

843
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:27,550
Who died?

844
01:02:27,621 --> 01:02:29,050
My wife's, uh...

845
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,829
It's a long story.

846
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:36,545
Look, you tell Gopnik, Arthur Gopnik,
he's breaking the law.

847
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:38,914
We're not arresting him now,
but next time we will.

848
01:02:38,981 --> 01:02:41,795
Gambling's against the law in this state.
That's just the way it is.

849
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,577
All right.
Go back to your thing.

850
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:46,753
Sorry, sir.

851
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:52,574
Dad, we get channel four now,
but not channel seven.

852
01:02:52,677 --> 01:02:54,945
Arthur, how could you do that
to this family?

853
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,461
- On Sy's...
- It's hardly a crime, I mean, nobody got hurt.

854
01:02:58,565 --> 01:02:59,940
That doesn't make it right!

855
01:03:00,036 --> 01:03:01,663
He won a lot of money, Dad.

856
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:03,422
The Mentaculus really works!

857
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:05,858
You knew about it?

858
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:08,699
- Well...
- They must have finked me out.

859
01:03:09,637 --> 01:03:10,978
They knew I could just go on winning,

860
01:03:11,077 --> 01:03:12,505
so they blackballed me and now...

861
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:13,987
What did you do with the money you won?

862
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,262
What's going on?

863
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:21,152
Well, I didn't want it,
and Danny said that he could use it...

864
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:22,333
That is so unfair!

865
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:23,713
- What are you...
- I'll tell you what's unfair.

866
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,668
What's unfair is them
not letting me play in their card game.

867
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:27,706
Why give him the money?
You know what he spends it on?

868
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,795
I know about the records.

869
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:30,811
Records? Do you think
he buys records from Mike Fagle?

870
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,346
At least I'm not saving up
for a nose job.

871
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,664
- What a brat!
- What?

872
01:03:33,764 --> 01:03:36,514
Nobody in this house is getting a nose job!
You got that?

873
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:39,771
Danny!
You're not excused!

874
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:40,956
We're still talking!

875
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:42,751
What was this card game, Arthur?

876
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,730
Some goys put together a private game.

877
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:45,981
I think that they're Italian.

878
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,458
Danny!
What's going on?

879
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,922
Danny?
We're sitting shiva here.

880
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:04,353
Well, she has retained
Barney Silver at Tuchman, Marsh.

881
01:04:05,476 --> 01:04:07,070
This is a...

882
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:11,385
- This is an aggressive firm, Larry.
- Mmm-hmm.

883
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,275
These are not pleasant people.

884
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,340
Judith is free to retain whoever she...

885
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:20,635
I take it you don't talk?

886
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,242
It's hard.
I think she emptied our bank account.

887
01:04:26,307 --> 01:04:27,289
Mmm.

888
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,228
I tried to ask her about it, very civilly. She...
- Yeah.

889
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,416
Yeah, you need to open a new account
in your name only.

890
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:38,784
Put your paychecks in there
from here on out.

891
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:40,541
- Can I?
- Oh, absolutely.

892
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,105
It's not dishonest?

893
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,838
Oh, absolutely.

894
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:45,434
- You...
- I hate to say this,

895
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:49,119
but I think she's also been
sneaking cash out of my wallet.

896
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:51,128
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

897
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:56,893
Yeah, well, this is
definitely adversarial.

898
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,777
Larry? Are you all right?
Larry!

899
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:06,429
Hey, come on now! Larry!
There's no need for that.

900
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,190
Larry, Larry, we...

901
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,813
We're going to get through this.

902
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:17,751
Have you talked to the Rabbi?

903
01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:24,733
I talked to Nachtner.

904
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:27,938
Was he helpful at all?

905
01:05:30,786 --> 01:05:32,860
What, did he tell you
about the goy's teeth?

906
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:36,731
You should try to talk to Marshak.

907
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:40,028
They told me he doesn't do
pastoral work anymore.

908
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:41,146
He just...

909
01:05:42,498 --> 01:05:45,150
congratulates the bar mitzvah boy
every week.

910
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:46,494
Well, that's too bad.

911
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,143
He's a very wise man, Marshak.

912
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:51,998
Getting old.

913
01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:54,010
Very old.

914
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:56,894
No, me.

915
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:01,210
- Uh, Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.
- Not now.

916
01:06:01,315 --> 01:06:02,972
Does he ever come to the phone?

917
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:08,737
If I came in, could...

918
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,496
Well, how about
at Rabbi Marshak's convenience?

919
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:17,275
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

920
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:20,545
Well, could I give you my number
at the Jolly Roger?

921
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:23,228
X squared, so that delta X equals

922
01:06:23,298 --> 01:06:26,266
the square root of .077 A
squared minus zero,

923
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,438
from which we derive the square root
of .077 A squared.

924
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:30,967
And also, the uncertainty

925
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:34,239
in P is equal to the square root
of bracket P squared

926
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:36,673
minus bracket P squared,

927
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,128
which also equals the square root
of H over A squared.

928
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:41,851
Which lets us delta X, delta P

929
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:45,697
equals the square root of .077 A squared,

930
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:50,945
H over A squared, and 1.74 H bar.

931
01:06:51,043 --> 01:06:52,351
Okay?

932
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,911
The Uncertainty Principle.

933
01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:57,465
It proves we can't ever really know

934
01:06:57,538 --> 01:06:59,032
what's going on.

935
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:06,907
But even though you can't figure
anything out,

936
01:07:06,978 --> 01:07:09,695
you will be responsible for it
on the mid-term.

937
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:15,612
- Did you follow that?
- Of course.

938
01:07:16,226 --> 01:07:18,746
Except that I know what's going on.

939
01:07:19,394 --> 01:07:20,824
How do you explain?

940
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:24,672
Well, it might be that in,
you know, in olam ha-ba...

941
01:07:24,737 --> 01:07:27,706
Excuse me, not the point.
In this world, Larry.

942
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:32,315
Now I'll concede that
it's subtle, it's clever.

943
01:07:32,994 --> 01:07:35,612
But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

944
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:37,985
Well, yes, it's convincing.

945
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:40,023
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

946
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:44,255
No, excuse me.
Mathematics is the art of the possible.

947
01:07:45,025 --> 01:07:46,880
I don't think so.

948
01:07:46,945 --> 01:07:49,793
The art of the possible, that's...

949
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,451
I can't remember.
Something else.

950
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:52,829
I'm a serious man, Larry.

951
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:55,570
I know that So, if I've got it wrong,
what do I...

952
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,726
So simple.

953
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,382
See Marshak.

954
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:02,458
I know! I want to see Marshak!
I want to see Marshak!

955
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:05,150
I fucked your wife, Larry!

956
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:08,480
I seriously fucked her!
That's what's going on!

957
01:08:08,545 --> 01:08:09,545
See Marshak!

958
01:08:42,176 --> 01:08:43,519
Mr. Gopnik.

959
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:46,104
Hello, Mrs. Samsky.

960
01:08:46,176 --> 01:08:49,341
I was going to knock,
and then I thought you weren't here.

961
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,707
I thought I heard something.

962
01:08:51,777 --> 01:08:53,599
Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?

963
01:08:53,664 --> 01:08:55,868
- No, I...
- It's cooler.

964
01:08:55,936 --> 01:08:57,365
Oh. Okay.

965
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,184
I've noticed that Mr. Samsky
isn't around, and I, uh...

966
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,759
- He travels.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

967
01:09:09,824 --> 01:09:12,507
So I thought I should let you know,
since you're somewhat new here,

968
01:09:12,576 --> 01:09:17,465
if you ever have, whatever,
chores that you'd, um...

969
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:22,009
Or just help with something I've decided
to help others, in a neighborly way.

970
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,173
- How thoughtful.
- Oh, it's nothing.

971
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:29,654
It's just good to know
your neighbors, and to help.

972
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,135
Help others.

973
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:35,734
Although I don't care much for my neighbors
on the other side, I must say.

974
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:39,519
- Goys, aren't they?
- Mmm. Very much so.

975
01:09:39,585 --> 01:09:42,487
Although maybe it's not fair to judge.
I have to admit...

976
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,900
Won't you sit down?

977
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,269
Oh, um...
Okay. Thank you.

978
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:48,408
- Iced tea? I have some.
- Okay.

979
01:09:53,984 --> 01:09:55,545
I don't see you much around either.

980
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,511
Yes, actually I haven't been home
a lot recently. I, uh...

981
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:03,770
My wife and I are...

982
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:09,372
Well, she's got me staying at the Jolly Roger,
the little motel there on...

983
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,930
You're in the doghouse, huh?

984
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:17,046
Yes. That's an understatement,
I guess. Thank you.

985
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,094
I guess I...

986
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,101
Do you take advantage
of the new freedoms?

987
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,533
What do you mean?

988
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:40,027
It's something I do.

989
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:43,033
For recreation.

990
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:46,007
That's...

991
01:10:47,614 --> 01:10:49,371
- marijuana?
- Mmm-hmm.

992
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:53,847
You'll find you'll need
the iced tea.

993
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,386
Is it...

994
01:11:02,463 --> 01:11:03,893
Well, okay.

995
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,197
Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.

996
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,853
Who's Rabbi Scott?

997
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:34,875
The junior rabbi.

998
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:37,430
The junior rabbi.

999
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,408
What did he say?

1000
01:11:53,344 --> 01:11:54,771
He spoke of...

1001
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,132
perception.

1002
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,166
All my problems are just...

1003
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,430
Just a...

1004
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,792
A mere...

1005
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:13,364
Is that a siren?

1006
01:12:14,783 --> 01:12:15,783
No.

1007
01:12:17,694 --> 01:12:19,101
Sometimes people get paranoid...

1008
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,692
Holy cow, that is a siren.

1009
01:12:26,335 --> 01:12:27,335
Hey!

1010
01:12:29,215 --> 01:12:30,215
Hey!

1011
01:12:32,318 --> 01:12:33,318
Hey!

1012
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:34,488
Does this man live here?

1013
01:12:34,494 --> 01:12:37,145
- Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.
- This is crazy!

1014
01:12:37,213 --> 01:12:39,069
I didn't know what to tell them.
They asked me for my address.

1015
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:41,337
It's just mathematics.
You can't arrest a man for mathematics.

1016
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,675
I didn't know whether to tell them here,
or at the Jolly Roger.

1017
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:44,822
Do you know this man?

1018
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:46,551
I just figured that this would
sound better. I don't know.

1019
01:12:46,622 --> 01:12:49,143
Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?

1020
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:51,582
It's all a mistake. I mean,
not a mistake, a miscarriage...

1021
01:12:51,677 --> 01:12:53,434
- Hello, Mrs. Samsky.
- Hello, Arthur.

1022
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:55,389
- Does this man live here?
- He sleeps on the couch.

1023
01:12:55,453 --> 01:12:56,663
Look. What did he do?

1024
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:59,069
- Nothing! I didn't do anything!
- Dad sleeps on a cot.

1025
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:01,337
Sir, we picked this man up
at the North Dakota.

1026
01:13:01,438 --> 01:13:04,505
- But I didn't do anything! I didn't...
- The North Dakota?

1027
01:13:04,574 --> 01:13:06,396
Solicitation. Sodomy.
Very serious.

1028
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:07,542
But I didn't do anything.

1029
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:08,662
"Sodomy"?

1030
01:13:09,597 --> 01:13:11,256
What's sodomy, Dad?

1031
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:15,930
What does Arthur say?

1032
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,375
He says he didn't do anything.

1033
01:13:20,478 --> 01:13:21,655
Uh-huh.

1034
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:26,578
He says he just
went in for a drink.

1035
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:27,832
Uh-huh.

1036
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,527
- Does Arthur drink?
- No.

1037
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:34,710
Uh-huh.

1038
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:37,844
The North Dakota.

1039
01:13:39,134 --> 01:13:40,180
Well...

1040
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:43,922
You'll need a criminal attorney.

1041
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:47,444
- Okay. Who's...
- Ron Meshbesher.

1042
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,917
- Is he good?
- Ron is very good.

1043
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:53,208
I don't understand.

1044
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,828
- He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.
- Mmm.

1045
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:02,487
- I would call Ron Meshbesher.
- Is he expensive?

1046
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:05,143
Ron is not cheap.

1047
01:14:06,462 --> 01:14:07,509
Yeah.

1048
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:10,643
Oh, Sol, come in,
we could use some good news.

1049
01:14:12,029 --> 01:14:14,582
Sol's been going over
the property line issue

1050
01:14:14,654 --> 01:14:16,541
and he wouldn't go into details,
but he seems to think

1051
01:14:16,636 --> 01:14:19,125
there's a nifty way out of this.

1052
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:21,333
Says it was pure luck
that he caught something.

1053
01:14:21,436 --> 01:14:23,925
I guess that's why
you're full partner, eh, Sol?

1054
01:14:43,037 --> 01:14:45,971
- Danny's bar mitzvah is...
- This week.

1055
01:14:46,077 --> 01:14:49,011
This Shabbas?
Great, great.

1056
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:09,271
Professor Gopnik, Dick Dutton.

1057
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:11,194
Heart attack.
Call back.

1058
01:15:20,893 --> 01:15:22,070
Larry?

1059
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:28,470
As you know, the tenure committee
meets on... What?

1060
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:31,770
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1061
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,716
I'm sorry.
I know you've hit a rough patch.

1062
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,503
Someone just...

1063
01:15:36,572 --> 01:15:38,328
But I'm fine.

1064
01:15:40,572 --> 01:15:44,216
Well, as you know,
the tenure committee meets on Wednesday

1065
01:15:44,315 --> 01:15:46,770
- to make its final determinations, so if...
- Arlen,

1066
01:15:48,573 --> 01:15:50,164
I am not an evil man.

1067
01:15:50,748 --> 01:15:53,782
- No, no, Larry, no, of course not.
- I am not!

1068
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:55,673
No, we don't make moral judgments.

1069
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:58,423
I went to the Aster Art once.

1070
01:15:58,493 --> 01:16:00,248
I saw Swedish Reverie.

1071
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,289
No, it's okay.
We don't need to know.

1072
01:16:02,395 --> 01:16:04,087
It wasn't even erotic.

1073
01:16:04,188 --> 01:16:07,036
Although it was, in a way.

1074
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,619
It's all right, really, Larry.
Believe me.

1075
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:12,627
Yeah, okay.

1076
01:16:12,988 --> 01:16:15,541
Okay. Okay.

1077
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:19,707
So, we decide on Wednesday.

1078
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:22,259
So, if there's anything
that you want to

1079
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:24,698
submit in support
of your tenure application,

1080
01:16:24,796 --> 01:16:27,349
we would need it by Wednesday.

1081
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,176
Submit?
What do you...

1082
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:31,664
Well, anything.
Any published work.

1083
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:35,220
Anything you've done
outside the institution.

1084
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:38,073
Anything at all
that we should be aware of.

1085
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:41,305
- I haven't done anything.
- Uh-huh.

1086
01:16:41,372 --> 01:16:43,346
- I haven't published.
- Uh-huh.

1087
01:16:43,418 --> 01:16:45,841
- You're still getting those...
- Uh-huh.

1088
01:16:46,587 --> 01:16:50,483
- Those anonymous...
- No, no, I know. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1089
01:16:50,587 --> 01:16:52,693
- Okay. Okay. Wednesday?
- Uh-huh.

1090
01:16:52,796 --> 01:16:56,243
Um... Okay Uh...
Don't worry.

1091
01:16:56,954 --> 01:17:00,216
Doing nothing is not bad.
Ipso facto.

1092
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:03,256
Just relax.

1093
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,684
Try to relax.

1094
01:17:07,131 --> 01:17:11,222
Oh, my God, Mrs. Samsky!

1095
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:12,568
So good.

1096
01:17:25,051 --> 01:17:27,439
Nailing it down.
So important.

1097
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,631
Please. I need help. I've already talked
to the other rabbis. Please.

1098
01:17:53,338 --> 01:17:55,412
It's not about Danny's bar mitzvah.

1099
01:17:55,515 --> 01:17:57,751
My boy, Danny.
This coming Shabbas.

1100
01:17:57,819 --> 01:17:59,673
Very joyous event.
That's all fine.

1101
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:04,823
It's more about myself.
I've had quite a bit of tsuris lately.

1102
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:07,193
Marital problems, professional,
you name it.

1103
01:18:07,259 --> 01:18:08,981
This is not a frivolous request.

1104
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,644
This is a...

1105
01:18:10,747 --> 01:18:12,404
I'm a...

1106
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:15,735
I've tried to be a serious man,
you know?

1107
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:19,216
Tried to do right, be a member
of the community, raise the...

1108
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:23,283
Danny, Sarah, they both
go to school, Hebrew school.

1109
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,847
A good breakfast...

1110
01:18:24,954 --> 01:18:28,369
Well, Danny goes to Hebrew school,
Sarah doesn't have time.

1111
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:31,060
She mostly washes her hair.

1112
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,159
Apparently there are
several steps involved,

1113
01:18:34,266 --> 01:18:37,048
but you don't have to tell Marshak that,
just tell him I need help.

1114
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,122
Please. I need help.

1115
01:19:31,194 --> 01:19:32,819
The Rabbi is busy.

1116
01:19:35,546 --> 01:19:37,270
He didn't look busy.

1117
01:19:39,448 --> 01:19:40,877
He's thinking.

1118
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:58,804
Arthur?

1119
01:20:06,457 --> 01:20:07,603
Arthur?

1120
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:09,997
What's wrong?

1121
01:20:10,618 --> 01:20:13,814
It'll be okay.
Arthur, we'll...

1122
01:20:13,912 --> 01:20:16,662
Don't worry, we'll get Ron Meshbesher.
It'll be okay...

1123
01:20:22,168 --> 01:20:23,380
Arthur!

1124
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:26,100
Arthur!

1125
01:20:37,016 --> 01:20:40,213
Arthur! You've got
to pull yourself together!

1126
01:20:40,313 --> 01:20:43,510
It's all shit, Larry!
It's all shit!

1127
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:44,984
Arthur, don't use that word.

1128
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:47,088
It's just fucking shit!

1129
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:48,193
Arthur.

1130
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:50,421
Look at all that Hashem
has given you!

1131
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:53,521
What has he given me?
He hasn't given me shit!

1132
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:57,421
Arthur. What do I have?
I live at the Jolly Roger.

1133
01:20:57,497 --> 01:21:00,944
You have a family!
You have a job!

1134
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:04,180
Hashem hasn't given me shit.
He hasn't given me bupkes!

1135
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:07,095
It's not fair to blame Hashem,
Arthur. Please.

1136
01:21:07,193 --> 01:21:09,135
Sometimes...
Please calm down.

1137
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:11,280
Sometimes you have to help yourself.

1138
01:21:13,528 --> 01:21:15,600
Hashem hasn't given me shit.

1139
01:21:16,953 --> 01:21:19,670
Now I can't even play cards.

1140
01:21:26,457 --> 01:21:29,010
It's okay, it's okay.

1141
01:21:29,144 --> 01:21:31,761
It's okay, it's okay.

1142
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:57,365
Is this it?

1143
01:21:57,944 --> 01:22:00,694
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, there.

1144
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:14,444
Look, this should help you
get back on your feet.

1145
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,814
Oh, my God.
Where did you get this?

1146
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:22,317
- It doesn't matter.
- This is a lot of money.

1147
01:22:22,712 --> 01:22:25,132
- It should get you started.
- I know, but this is a lot of money.

1148
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,896
- You sure you don't need it?
- Arthur, I'm fine.

1149
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:28,528
Come on, get in.
When you're settled,

1150
01:22:28,631 --> 01:22:30,257
let me know how to get in touch.

1151
01:22:30,328 --> 01:22:32,149
You're sure?

1152
01:22:32,216 --> 01:22:33,524
It's fine.

1153
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,783
Larry. I'm sorry.

1154
01:22:53,847 --> 01:22:55,189
What I said last night.

1155
01:22:55,256 --> 01:22:56,881
I know.

1156
01:22:56,984 --> 01:22:58,292
It's okay.

1157
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:04,337
Goodbye!

1158
01:23:13,463 --> 01:23:15,405
There's another Jew, son!

1159
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:35,380
Were we out at the pool last night?

1160
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:39,023
Yeah.

1161
01:23:41,175 --> 01:23:42,451
I'm sorry.

1162
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:52,011
It's Shabbas.

1163
01:23:55,766 --> 01:23:57,359
Give me that fucker.

1164
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:53,521
I'm sorry that...
That things have been so hard for us.

1165
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,466
It's okay.

1166
01:26:57,524 --> 01:27:00,045
Sy had so much respect for you, Larry.

1167
01:27:01,685 --> 01:27:04,336
He wrote letters to
the tenure committee.

1168
01:27:15,988 --> 01:27:17,844
Jesus Christ.

1169
01:27:19,604 --> 01:27:22,255
Taking your place
as a member of our tribe.

1170
01:27:22,323 --> 01:27:24,363
Now, you will go
and see Rabbi Marshak.

1171
01:27:24,469 --> 01:27:28,081
Afterwards, you will celebrate
in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall.

1172
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:32,206
And then, you will be a member of
B'Nai Avraham and the Nation of Israel.

1173
01:27:32,309 --> 01:27:36,335
Danny Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes
a gift to you of this Kiddush cup,

1174
01:27:36,404 --> 01:27:40,496
so that you will remember this blessed day
on the next Shabbas and the next,

1175
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:43,019
and on every Shabbas
of a long and fruitful life.

1176
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:48,012
And until that wonderful day when you stand
under the chuppah, we say amen.

1177
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:26,121
When the truth

1178
01:29:27,443 --> 01:29:28,970
is found

1179
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,233
to be lies...

1180
01:29:40,851 --> 01:29:43,600
and all the hope

1181
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,600
within you dies...

1182
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:57,840
Then what?

1183
01:30:00,305 --> 01:30:02,859
Grace Slick.

1184
01:30:04,243 --> 01:30:06,414
Marty Balin.

1185
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:09,840
Paul Kantner.

1186
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:13,038
Jorma...

1187
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,115
Kaukonen.

1188
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,872
something.

1189
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:21,104
These are the members

1190
01:30:22,259 --> 01:30:24,494
of the Airplane.

1191
01:30:24,561 --> 01:30:26,471
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

1192
01:30:57,265 --> 01:30:58,728
Be a good boy.

1193
01:31:04,402 --> 01:31:06,256
Danny was magnificent.

1194
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:08,442
Oh.

1195
01:31:08,978 --> 01:31:10,636
Thank you, Arlen.

1196
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:13,194
Mazel tov.
It was wonderful.

1197
01:31:13,778 --> 01:31:16,233
Yes, it was.
Thank you.

1198
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:18,760
Such a time of nachas.

1199
01:31:18,865 --> 01:31:21,516
He's your youngest,
you have to savor it.

1200
01:31:22,002 --> 01:31:23,114
I do.

1201
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,323
I will.

1202
01:31:26,257 --> 01:31:29,159
- Well, see you at the staff caf.
- Yes.

1203
01:31:29,265 --> 01:31:30,475
I, uh...

1204
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,559
Just, um...

1205
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:37,296
I shouldn't tell you this,
I'm not telling you officially.

1206
01:31:37,362 --> 01:31:40,875
The tenure candidates
aren't notified till Thursday.

1207
01:31:43,345 --> 01:31:44,393
Yes?

1208
01:31:45,265 --> 01:31:47,021
You'll be very pleased.

1209
01:31:49,521 --> 01:31:53,166
- Thank you, Arlen.
- I didn't say anything. Mazel tov.

1210
01:32:45,617 --> 01:32:46,761
Fagle.

1211
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,051
There's a tornado warning
from the weather service.

1212
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:31,528
Mr. Turchik has decided to move us
into the basement of the synagogue.

1213
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,432
We will form two lines.

1214
01:34:28,975 --> 01:34:32,171
That fucking flag's gonna rip
right off the flagpole!

1215
01:34:46,287 --> 01:34:47,287
