<i>Number 4...</i>

3
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,240
<i>I do solemnly swear...</i>

4
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,210
<i>that I will
support and defend...</i>

5
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,083
<i>the Constitution
of the United States...</i>

6
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:08,086
<i>against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.</i>

7
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>You call yourselves soldiers?</i>

8
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:13,623
<i>You ain't no soldier!
You ain't no soldier!</i>

9
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,939
<i>Aim! Shoot!</i>

10
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:31,386
<i>Hell no, we won't go!</i>

11
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:51,558
<i>The allied offensive
In northern Iran</i>

12
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,497
<i>could be the turning point
in the war.</i>

13
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:56,380
<i>That, according to the Pentagon
where a spokesman says...</i>

14
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,438
Can you make these changes for me?

15
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,460
<i>Sure.</i>

16
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,595
Twelfth and Broadway.
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:02,265
<i>'This is worse
than Vietnam.'</i>

18
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,831
<i>Those words from Joey Silver,
draft eligible,</i>

19
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,704
<i>34-year old,
currently working on Wall Street.</i>

20
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,574
<i>Polls in the U.S.
show seven out of ten Americans</i>

21
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:14,276
<i>oppose any move to dig
deeper into the draft ranks.</i>

22
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:18,311
<i>The decision last month to up
the acceptable draft age to 35,</i>

23
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:21,016
<i>has triggered a tidal wave
of protest.</i>

24
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,955
<i>Opposition now spreading
from college co-eds</i>

25
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:27,770
<i>to corporate offices.
Opponents are...</i>

26
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:35,295
<i>- Earlier this week Officers scoffed
in Baghdad, killed more than 120.</i>

27
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,033
<i>Caldwell acknowledged
things have not gone to plan.</i>

28
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,702
<i>If you look throughout
what's occurring in the city,</i>

29
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:44,281
<i>I know the question asked is,
'Are these efforts enough?'</i>

00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:56,088
Dixon.

31
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,252
I'm home, Ma.

32
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,056
So when are you
moving into the office?

33
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,622
And be stuck in
this hole with you?

34
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,293
It's not for me, Gussie.

35
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,197
But thank you,
I'm flattered.

36
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,734
Don't be flattered.
You're the only other person

37
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,752
that speaks English around here.

38
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:43,930
<i>Yeah, I think something on the
order of 25,000 more troops</i>

39
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,938
<i>probably would be necessary
to do what I think we need to do</i>

40
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,571
<i>in the country
to establish security.</i>

41
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:53,173
<i>Security is really
the essential element here.</i>

42
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:56,527
<i>It is very hard for Americans
to think about this...</i>

43
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,306
So now you just leave?

44
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:59,474
<i>Just leave.
That's it. You just go.</i>

45
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,290
It says I got 30 days.

46
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,580
I can't believe this.

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,250
It's got nothing to do with me.

48
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,122
<i>I mean,
listen to this.</i>

49
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:15,593
'Our nation has embarked upon
a great quest.

50
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,460
'It's up to us to light the path ahead

51
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,094
and make the world a freer and safer
place for all.'

52
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:21,444
Is that what we're doing?!

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,278
Babe, is that what we're doing?

54
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:34,379
Is it? I mean...

55
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,627
God, I had a very specific plan for us!

56
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,421
Thanks for your call.

57
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:09,294
<i>I haven't decided.</i>

58
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,463
Hey, pal.

59
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,186
How are you?

60
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,900
Alright, yourself?

61
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:24,068
Thanks.

62
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,676
I'm right in the middle of my book.

63
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm not gonna be done in time.

64
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,597
It's our turn, guys.

65
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,260
Hey.

66
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,118
It's only fair.

67
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,022
You wanna go?

68
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:54,188
I gotta tell ya,

69
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,790
after 9/11

70
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,595
doing the goddamn
building, for chrissake,

71
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:03,765
In LA?
Yeah,

72
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:06,412
Yeah! You're goddamn right I do.

73
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,885
The fucked up thing is we
don't have a choice anyways.

74
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:15,587
Right.

75
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:19,856
To freedom.

76
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:23,819
A toast?

77
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,824
That's right.
Get your fucking glass.

78
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,342
Come on, boys.

79
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:33,593
To freedom.

80
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,944
Tequila.

81
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,085
<i>Oh boy.</i>

82
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,340
<i>Hey, I know you.</i>

83
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,213
From the street.
Yesterday.

84
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,313
Yeah. I'm sorry.
James.

85
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,914
<i>Hi, James.
Patricia.</i>

86
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,550
Very nice to meet you.

87
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,468
<i>And you.</i>

88
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,957
What brings you down here?

89
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:04,394
Just here with a couple
of girlfriends,

90
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:05,194
having a drink.

91
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:08,397
Okay.

92
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:12,167
Well, you guys have a good time.

93
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,801
<i>Thanks.
You too.</i>

94
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,773
<i>Have a
great time.</i>

95
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,640
Nice to meet you.

96
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,784
<i>Yeah, nice
to meet you.</i>

97
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:23,745
What the fuck was that?

98
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:26,948
I see her sometimes
after the shift.

99
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:28,486
You blew that!

100
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,453
I'll see her again.

101
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:30,387
Have a good time?

102
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,857
That was so lame.

103
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:35,157
I mean, the weakest attempt ever.

104
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,526
She came up to you.

105
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,326
Did you see that?

106
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:38,762
Unbelievable.

107
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:42,044
You're buying a second round
too now, jarhead.

108
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:49,037
<i>Horribly, horribly wrong.</i>

109
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:53,775
<i>To this day, it's the only
fight I ever had.</i>

110
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,113
My glasses broke.
I was swinging everywhere.

111
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,415
Just swinging.

112
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,385
I couldn't see a thing.

113
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,085
I'm not much of a fighter
to begin with.

114
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,854
Shocker.

115
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:08,421
<i>I just don't think
I could pull the trigger.</i>

116
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,394
<i>Not if I could see
the person.</i>

117
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:13,003
<i>Not if I could look into
their eyes.</i>

118
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:22,105
<i>Well, warfare today
isn't really so much</i>

119
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,670
about hand to hand combat.

120
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,113
I'm just saying.
I've got a lot of things to do.

121
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:32,482
I gotta notify people...
a lot of stuff.

122
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,046
A lot of stuff.

123
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,020
Hm. Well.

124
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,255
My publisher is waiting for my book.

125
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,991
They paid me a hell of a lot
of money,

126
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,793
I mean.

127
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,495
<i>I'm sure
they'll understand.</i>

128
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,832
Well, what if they don't?
Huh?

129
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,202
<i>What about that?</i>

130
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,745
You'll be fine, Aaron.

131
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,222
Really?

132
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,420
Have you seen Mara?

133
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,995
Just gettin' in.

134
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,292
She ain't at your place
again, is she?

135
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,891
Said I'm just comin' in.

136
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,662
<i>If she's up there,
send her home.</i>

137
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,013
<i>She's not your kid.</i>

138
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>Don't you get Cosmo ,
or Vogue , or anything? </i>

139
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,797
Trouble in River City?

140
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,926
Same poop.
Different day.

141
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,462
Wanna go eat something?

142
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,093
<i>Sure.</i>

143
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:55,330
<i>Here.</i>

144
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,269
Want a hot dog, hot dog?

145
00:11:58,369 --> 00:11:59,069
Yup.

146
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:10,480
What do you think
about this war?

147
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,079
Mom says we're killing
innocent people.

148
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,586
When she's lucid.

149
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:20,220
Dad says,
'Nuke them all.'

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,660
<i>Well, what do
you think?</i>

151
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,494
I don't know.

152
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,466
What do you mean
you don't know?

153
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:32,436
Isn't it time you
had opinions of your own?

154
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,534
I think this hot dog sucks.

155
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:35,803
That's a start.

156
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:38,039
You don't have to go
if you're deemed

157
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,477
unacceptable for
military service.

158
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:41,946
Hey, Molly?

159
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,577
<i>What's unacceptable?</i>

160
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,583
<i>If you're declared
medically unfit</i>

161
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,214
<i>or impaired in
some way.</i>

162
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,282
<i>Or if you're gay you don't
have to go either,</i>

163
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,917
<i>did you know that?</i>

164
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,687
<i>All I gotta do is fabricate
a gay background.</i>

165
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:53,522
<i>I could be gay.</i>

166
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,155
You're not gay.

167
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,722
<i>No, but they don't know that.</i>

168
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,494
<i>You make a good case,
you win.</i>

169
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:00,931
That's how everything works.

170
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,365
You could also go to jail for lying.

171
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,940
Only if they catch me.

172
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,036
<i>Honey,</i>

173
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:11,875
<i>I could be blind.
That'd probably do the trick.</i>

174
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:16,443
<i>There's nothing there.
It's completely arbitrary.</i>

175
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:21,452
It's a lottery.
There's no due process there.

176
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,988
I have worked way too hard
for what we have.

177
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:27,803
<i>And I will not let them
take that away.</i>

178
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:35,161
<i>Helicopters probe the
skies of Washington DC,</i>

179

<i>and have increased
scrutiny of dams, ports,</i>

180
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,107
<i>borders, power plants.</i>

181
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:46,059
<i>New York City
has its own massive effort</i>

182
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,809
<i>called Operation Atlas,</i>

183
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,965
<i>which includes monitoring

184
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,133
<i>or nuclear agents.</i>

185
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,349
<i>Restricted airspace
above the city...</i>

186
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:56,517
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>

187
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:59,664
Hey, Dixon.
I need your help.

188
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,329
I am fucked!

189
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,527
I am fucking fucked!

190
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:08,594
<i>So fucked!</i>

191
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:12,935
Look! I'm like fat and skinny
at the same time.

192
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,569
That's barely possible.

193
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:18,239
I knew I should've been working
out all these years.

194
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,611
Thigh Master. Soloflex.
That Abdominizer.

195
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,581
That fucking skiing machine thing.

196
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,633
<i>Bowflex.</i>

197
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,627
How do these people live?

198
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:38,995
<i>Take that off.</i>

199
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,397
Huh?

200
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,972
<i>The 25 at the end,
take it off.</i>

201
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:48,505
<i>You alright?</i>

202
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:49,805
Yeah, it's fine.

203
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,621
<i>You sit down
over there, relax.</i>

204
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,390
Oh, Dixon,
please help me.

205
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,574
Here you go, Dad.

206
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:24,152
<i>My Dad. One of the youngest
pilots in the Air Force. Ever.</i>

207
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:31,378
Your grandmother always said he
couldn't wait to go.

208
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:34,081
His 18th birthday he went down
and signed up.

209
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:39,686
<i>Everybody knew it was the right
thing to do, but...</i>

210
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:43,141
<i>that was a different time.
A different war.</i>

211
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,596
<i>This is a decision you're
gonna have to live with...</i>

212
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:52,035
<i>the rest of your life.</i>

213
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:55,005
This goes to the core of a man

214
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:59,639
and nobody,
not a father, nobody,

215
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,319
can tell him what to do.

216
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,060
Can you get me out of it?

217
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:19,936
I'll try.

218
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,701
I'll talk to Senator Boone.

219
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,903
It's a strange political
climate right now.

220
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,375
I know, Dad.

221
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,858
I'll... I'll try.

222
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,089
<i>Aw, get outta here.</i>

223
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,027
Excuse me!

224
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,226
Excuse me, young lady!

225
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,361
You know how to get to Broadway?

226
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,401
I can't find my way.

227
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,868
You again.

228
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,302
Broadway is that way.

229
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,637
Yeah? Hey, let me take you
where you're going.

230
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,871
That's alright.
I'm okay. Thank you.

231
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:07,744
No, I got a special deal today
for girls with backpacks.

232
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,781
It's half off anywhere
you wanna go.

233
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:13,284
Really? Thank you,
I'm okay, though.

234
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:15,753
We got a small problem, you know.

235
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,255
I ain't gonna move till
you get in the car.

236
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:19,723
<i>Come on,
what do you say?</i>

237
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:21,287
<i>Move
You kidding</i>

238
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:24,295
<i>Buddy, move it</i>

239
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:25,695
Now you're talking.

240
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,996
Alright, but only because
of that deal.

241
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,968
I promise you you got the deal.

242
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:34,005
And you know you're gonna ride
in style, comfort and grace.

243
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:35,405
In the front?

244
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:36,874
Ever been in the front seat?

245
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,139
<i>Can't say that I have.</i>

246
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,739
Where you headed?

247
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,144
My parole hearing.

248
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:45,583
Parole hearing, huh? You're funny.

249
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:50,284
About halfway down the street,
by the school.

250
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,169
Oh, you like kids.

251
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,822
So, thanks for the ride.

252
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:57,775
Yeah.

253
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:03,900
Alright.

254
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,937
Hey, good luck with those kids.

255
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,837
Thanks.
They're easy.

256
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,739
Yeah?
Okay.

257
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,141
<i>Thanks for picking me up.</i>

258
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,109
You're welcome.

259
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,173
You have a good one.

260
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,276
Take care.
Bye.

261
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:17,331
<i>Bye.</i>

262
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:22,118
I'll tell you what.

263
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:27,971
'Insert C7 into D7
and assembly is complete.'

264
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,539
Hey.

265
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:24,231
I love you.

266
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,501
I know.

267
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:35,701
I'm not going.

268
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,226
What the fuck you talkin' about?

269
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,528
Seriously.

270
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:41,931
How?

271
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:45,835
I just made partner.
It's not a good time.

272
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,805
I'm just a cab driver, so...

273
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:48,969
It's not about you.

274
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,873
Bullshit it's not about me.

275
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,709
You guys go if you want. Okay?
That's your decision.

276
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,145
How do you not go?

277
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,810
<i>You live in that big apartment,</i>

278
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,115
you enjoy all this but when
it comes time to fight...

279
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,781
I earned all this.

280
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,320
When it comes time to be a man,

281
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,052
you feel you shouldn't have to go.

282
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,788
I'd be the first one out there
if we were defending ourselves.

283
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,326
Exactly what we're doing.

284
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:11,958
We're invading other countries!
Don't you get that?

285
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:15,641
Don't you all get it?
What?

286
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:24,106
Look, I don't want to die, man.
Not for this.

287
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:25,508
You think we'll die?

288
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:26,909
Maybe you'll die. So what?

289
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,209
<i>The draft is for a reason.</i>

290
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,876
Nobody wants to go.

291
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,917
They'd be there already.
That's the whole point.

292
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,817
Thinking for yourself, for once.

293
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,151
That what you did?

294
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,919
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

295
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,530
Molly asked you not to go?

296
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,391
Don't go there.

297
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,572
You really think
we'll die over there?

298
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:56,815
You're goin'.

299
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:05,790
Guys.

300
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:22,583
<i>Hey.</i>

301
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,085
It's okay.

302
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:39,348
Hey, look at me.

303
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,231
Stop it, please.

304
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,016
It's okay.

305
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,712
Molly.

306
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,341
Congratulations.
Five years.

307
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,678
<i>The survival rate
for this type of cancer</i>

308
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,716
<i>goes up to over 98%
from this point on.</i>

309
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:47,184
<i>I'm sure you're relieved.</i>

310
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,185
Thank you.

311
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,748
<i>Take care, dear.</i>

312
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,031
You too.

313
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:11,440
Excuse me,
didn't you write a book?

314
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,808
Uh, yeah.

315
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:13,791
I thought so.

316
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,695
Hey.

317
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:27,020
What? No wine, flowers,
anything for the host?

318
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,688
A book.

319
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:31,194
Now I thought maybe you could
learn something.

320
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,094
Fuck you.

321
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:32,995
Yeah.

322
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,329
Hi.

323
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:35,928
How are you?

324
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:37,563
I'm good.
Thank you for coming.

325
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,835
Aaron's already here.
Just grab a snack.

326
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,503
I'll grab you a drink.

327
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,525
So, anyway we thought...

328
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,884
<i>Do you really think you can</i>

329
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:56,217
<i>expect peace from people</i>

330
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:57,687
who don't know the
meaning of the word?

331
00:23:57,787 --> 00:23:58,689
That's the point.

332
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,252
We have to teach them.

333
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,489
<i>All they see is our tanks
and our bombs.</i>

334
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,090
Let's talk about the war on terror.

335
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,064
Yeah, let's.
Come on,

336
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,263
let's look at the war on terror
with these folks.

337
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,932
The entire so-called
preemption doctrine,

338
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,701
come on, that's a
complete failure.

339
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:16,222
Planting the seeds of democracy,
that's a failure to you?

340
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,120
<i>If I got drafted,
I just wouldn't go.</i>

341
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,779
Really?

342
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,714
Killing is wrong,
no matter who does it.

343
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:29,051
So is it wrong 1400 people died
in LA last year?

344
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:33,220
<i>How about the 3,000 that
died In 9/11?</i>

345
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,786
I say it is, but that...

346
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:36,490
<i>You were In
a fucking pedicure.</i>

347
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,394
<i>How can you really
be expected...</i>

348
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:41,398
Calm down.
Slow down.

349
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:42,899
Dixon!

350
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,599
I'm sorry, but you think
fighting is wrong 'cause

351
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,835
you never had to fight for
anything in your life.

352
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:50,340
What do you do? You suck
his dick once a month?

353
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,808
We're leaving.

354
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,175
No, no.

355
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,442
<i>Good, get the fuck out.</i>

356
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:59,416
Stay.

357
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:00,558
Dixon, get out.

358
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:05,165
Now.

359
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,105
I'll get out.

360
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,395
She says
'Fighting's wrong so we shouldn't go.'

361
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,131
Yeah, maybe that's
her point of view.

362
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,102
They live in a fucking ivory tower!

363
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:20,334
Hey!
Now that's enough!

364
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:22,787
I said get out!

365
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,387
I'm okay.

366
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:34,396
<i>It's okay.</i>

367
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,019
Get out of my house.

368
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,469
Get out of my house!

369
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,901
<i>Will you just stop for a second.</i>

370
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,167
What?

371
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:54,902
We were best friends at Stuyvesant.

372
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,373
<i>Yeah, you were best friends.</i>

373
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,875
And I know he was
kicked out for fighting.

374
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,108
There's something you don't know.

375
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,647
I'm listening.

376
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:06,414
Well,

377
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:10,921
in junior year I was having a problem
with this group of kids bullying me.

378
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:16,427
One day, they took my money...

379
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:21,094
and after school,
Dixon followed them.

380
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:24,832
Into an alley. And he beat
the shit out of them.

381
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,236
He put two in the hospital.
It was ugly.

382
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,951
And he was sent to a juvenile
center for two years.

383
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:40,445
Molly, he did that for me.

384
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:43,332
<i>He was defending me.</i>

385
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,092
<i>Hey, uh, Patricia,</i>

386
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,193
<i>It's, uh, It's me,
Dixon, from the cab.</i>

387
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,132
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

388
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:59,102
<i>I was wondering if you had any
plans for dinner tomorrow night.</i>

389
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,802
<i>Maybe, what did
you have in mind?</i>

390
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:06,310
<i>I know a kind of
a secret spot in Brooklyn.</i>

391
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,143
<i>Are you game?</i>

392
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:11,981
<i>You not gonna chop me up and
put me in a freezer?</i>

393
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:16,453
No, no.
Watch your step.

394
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,822
Did you find this place in the
guide to New York fine dining?

395
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:23,001
That's the one.
It's one of my favorites.

396
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,875
Watch your head.

397
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:38,286
<i>Wow.
It's beautiful.</i>

398
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:53,620
<i>So what do you do with a
Master's in Sociology anyway?</i>

399
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,690
<i>Teach. Work with kids.
Or research.</i>

400
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,827
That's really great.

401
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,895
I like it.

402
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,666
You have any brothers and sisters?

403
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:08,003
Two brothers.

404
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,372
Folks?

405
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,706
<i>They live in Minnesota.</i>

406
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,851
He still pinches her butt.

407
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,013
And you?

408
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,915
My mom died when I was 17.

409
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:22,419
I don't even know where my dad is.

410
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,455
I'm sorry...

411
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:25,854
<i>Don't be.
No.</i>

412
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,705
You don't have to be sorry for me.

413
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,583
<i>What are you doing?</i>

414
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,431
I'm gonna kiss you.

415
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,836
<i>The blasts were caused by a volley</i>

416
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:18,572
<i>of mortar rounds and one car bomb,
all detonating</i>

417
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:21,275
<i>within minutes of each other,
in Baghdad.</i>

418
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:24,782
<i>The mortars destroyed a bank and
collapsed one apartment building.</i>

419
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:28,617
<i>Iraqi emergency forces
found some survivors in the blast,</i>

420
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,351
<i>working for hours to find anyone
still alive in the rubble,</i>

421
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:35,623
<i>and to remove the bodies. The car
bomb destroyed a nearby gas station,</i>

422
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:39,461
<i>spraying burning gasoline onto
nearby houses, restaurants and stores.</i>

423
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,763
<i>Kurrawa is a religiously
mixed neighborhood.</i>

424
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,166
<i>Relatively safe
by Baghdad standards</i>

425
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,034
<i>and a home to a
number of leaders</i>

426
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:48,350
<i>in Iraq's largest
Shiite political party.</i>

427
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:52,908
<i>Dr. Elle's office.
Can I help you?</i>

428
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,961
<i>Yeah, It's Aaron.</i>

429
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,812
You should try to wrap...
up your affairs,

430
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:03,787
before you go.
I know that's important to you.

431
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:08,157
I don't know what to do next.

432
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:09,856
That's my problem now.

433
00:30:09,956 --> 00:30:13,560
I don't know where to start.

434
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,066
I think it's important
for you to keep

435
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:19,834
doing these things you
feel you need to do.

436
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:23,368
Being mentally prepared will help
you get through this, Aaron.

437
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:27,405
<i>What Is a six-letter word
for a Latin dance?</i>

438
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:29,277
Mentally prepared?

439
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:33,548
<i>Perhaps you should make a
list of all the important</i>

440
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:37,352
<i>things you need to accomplish.
And then just do them.</i>

441
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,355
A top ten.

442
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:41,521
That's it.
A top ten.

443
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,657
Salsa.
No, it's five.

444
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:46,542
Cha-cha.

445
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,678
Didn't know you were coming.

446
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,560
That makes two of us.

447
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,450
I made a list of all the things

448
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,366
I need to do in the next two weeks.

449
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,758
My top ten.
Before we go.

450
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,595
What are you talking about?

451
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:21,997
'Do ten shots of whiskey?'

452
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,561
What are you, in junior high?

453
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:26,299
I have 'fuck a prostitute' on
this, number five.

454
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,535
What's wrong with you?

455
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:32,149
Just things I gotta do before we go.

456
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,015
I'm still not going.

457
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:41,383
That's cause you're still a pussy.

458
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,717
Alright.

459
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,153
Fuck you, okay?

460
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:46,218
I'm outta here.

461
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,690
<i>Wait.</i>

462
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,298
I'll see you later.

463
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:54,706
Let him go.

464
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,019
You think I should do them in order?

465
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,740
'Cause I didn't really think
about the order.

466
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,625
I just sort of wrote them down.

467
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:52,088
<i>May I?</i>

468
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:53,537
Sure.

469
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:17,320
Wanna get out of here?

470
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,303
We're not here to talk.

471
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:40,717
Alright?

472
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:47,506
<i>I could fire a tank or launch
a bomb or something, but</i>

473
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:49,979
<i>I just don't think I could
shoot someone.</i>

474
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,499
<i>Not If could, like,
look into their eyes.</i>

475
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:58,727
That's very personal.
You know?

476
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,423
Like being in a tank,
or in a plane.

477
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,524
It's like the push of a button.

478
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:08,329
Down the barrel of a gun.

479
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,565
I don't know.

480
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:12,812
You tired?

481
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,185
I'll call you.

482
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:21,457
Uh-huh.

483
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:37,358
Dixon, let me talk to you.

484
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,592
What's up, Gus?

485
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:40,063
I want to take you off the schedule.

486
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,328
What are you talking about?

487
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,143
You need a break.

488
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,584
See some family. Go to Hawaii.
Do some things.

489
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:50,071
You worried about me, huh?

490
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,339
I like that. It's cute, Gus.

491
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,791
It really is.

492
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,252
<i>You wanna hear something crazy?</i>

493
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,254
I met a girl.

494
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,221
<i>Really?</i>

495
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,521
I did.

496
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:10,926
Yeah. I think I like her.
I really do.

497
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,492
I don't want to screw it up
like I do every single time.

498
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:16,865
<i>She's smart.
She's cool.</i>

499
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:19,633
She doesn't take any of my crap.

500
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,335
She's, uh, I don't
wanna push anything,

501
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:23,840
<i>I don't wanna screw things up.</i>

502
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,539
I really want to take it slow.

503
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,977
Slow is good.

504
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,311
<i>You think?</i>

505
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,489
Definitely.

506
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,877
Thanks for everything, Mom.
It's really great.

507
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:01,493
I drew this for you,
Uncle George.

508
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,273
Peepshow?

509
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:11,814
Twenty dollar, strip show.
Thirty dollar, masturbation.

510
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:17,686
It costs more if I, you know...?

511
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,655
Not you, you moron.
The girl.

512
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:23,175
Oh, right.

513
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,500
<i>Do you want to pull your cock out?</i>

514
00:37:58,178 --> 00:37:59,440
Maybe later.

515
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:03,228
I need you to promise me something.

516
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:06,033
You have to promise not to laugh.

517
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,300
Absolutely not.

518
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,173
No, I'm serious. You have to promise.

519
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:14,644
I promise you that I will not laugh.

520
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:15,741
Fine. Um...

521
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,612
Fine.

522
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,115
I'm so embarr...

523
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,550
You're laughing already!
I haven't even started!

524
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,717
I'm with you. I promise.
No laughing.

525
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:25,985
I'm here.

526
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,390
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

527
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,259
When I was 17,
I was a junior in high school.

528
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,561
There was this talent show competition.

529
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:36,763
And I was going to sing.

530
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:39,432
Geez, why am I telling you this?

531
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,769
Self-sabotage.

532
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,740
<i>I was going to sing
The Greatest Love of All</i>

533
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,871
by Whitney Houston.

534
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:46,876
Yeesh.

535
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,378
And I go out on stage,

536
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:51,442
and the spotlight comes up,

537
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,180
and the music starts.

538
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,482
And I forgot the words.

539
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,886
Nothing was retained.

540
00:38:57,986 --> 00:39:01,452
<i>Not even
The Greatest Love of All.</i>

541
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:03,492
The name of the song.

542
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,894
So...

543
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:07,931
I started to dance.
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:09,162
I couldn't sing.

545
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,499
Brilliant idea,
I'm gonna dance.

546
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,599
For a full three and a half minutes,

547
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,041
I sashayed around the stage.

548
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:21,606
Finally, the music stops,

549
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:23,444
and the crowd is just silent...

550
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:28,547
stunned by what has just come
before them.

551
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:32,583
And, um, the curtain
just sort of slowly

552
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:35,957
closes in front of me
and I went backstage

553
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:37,623
I went into a bathroom stall

554
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:40,703
and I cried for three hours.

555
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:50,072
Should I leave?
Should I go?

556
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:51,838
I should go, right?

557
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:54,018
Absolutely not.

558
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,520
Welcome to my humble abode.

559
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,038
This is it, huh? Yeah.

560
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,832
Want a beer or something?

561
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:18,710
Yeah.

562
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:32,771
<i>You say the troops are
moving to seal off the border.</i>

563
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:36,943
<i>We won't cut and run. The White
House says it's confident</i>

564
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:40,950
<i>our troops have the means necessary
to combat worsening violence.</i>

565
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,719
<i>In Iran, officials say Islamic militia
forces operating in Azerbaijan,</i>

566
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:50,322
<i>were responsible for storming a school
and executing 30 women and children.</i>

567
00:41:50,422 --> 00:41:53,026
<i>Most of the victims were beheaded
and burnt to death.</i>

568
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:56,763
<i>In Egypt, more than 20,000
people are now reported killed.</i>

569
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:59,201
<i>One million have been forced
from their homes,</i>

570
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:02,767
<i>all since rebels rose up against the
government three months ago.</i>

571
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:07,507
<i>Allied leaders say current troops
are sufficient to maintain peace.</i>

572
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:11,346
<i>This, despite the wave of
coordinated suicide bombings</i>

573
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:14,195
<i>this weekend stretching
from Onkura to Cairo.</i>

574
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:24,025
Hey, what's up, kid?

575
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,226
<i>Patricia, this is Mara.</i>

576
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:30,862
Oh, hi.
So nice to meet you finally.

577
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:32,699
You didn't tell me she was so pretty.

578
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,765
<i>Yeah, she is.</i>

579
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:39,708
Well, we should head out.

580
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,872
Let's go.

581
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,687
Okay, so let's do that.

582
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:43,786
Which one?

583
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:46,056
The, uh, motion to dismiss.

584
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:47,960
You mean, summary in judgment.

585
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,829
<i>George, your dad's on line one.</i>

586
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:52,995
Listen, guys, we're gonna
need to pick up later.

587
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:54,129
It's due tomorrow.

588
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:56,276
Later.

589
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:00,737
Hey, Dad.

590
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:02,506
<i>George, sorry it's taken me</i>

591
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:03,841
<i>so long to get back to you.</i>

592
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:05,142
No, it's okay.

593
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,011
<i>Look, I talked to Senator Boone.</i>

594
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:10,328
<i>I'm sorry, son.
You better get ready to go.</i>

595
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:28,500
Your agreement was very specific

596
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,767
on the exclusive nature
of your arrangement.

597
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:32,902
But he's selling our
competitors' equipment.

598
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,908
I know that but all we have to do

599
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:37,309
is look at the contract
that's in effect now and...

600
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,610
He told me I waived any
claim I might have had

601
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,378
because he's already
selling the stuff.

602
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:42,545
I told it doesn't matter.

603
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:43,550
But how do you know?

604
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,680
Because I'm the lawyer.

605
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,315
George.

606
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,551
<i>Put you boy on a leash here.</i>

607
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,022
I pay you guys a lot of money.

608
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:51,524
You do. So shut the fuck up
and let me do my job.

609
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:52,457
That's it.

610
00:43:52,557 --> 00:43:54,359
Mac!
Wait, please!

611
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:57,572
<i>George. Outside.
Now.</i>

612
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:03,499
That guy's an idiot.

613
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,701
So?

614
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:06,172
I don't have time for his nonsense.

615
00:44:06,272 --> 00:44:08,304
You have time for whatever the
hell he pays you

616
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,709
to have time for.
You understand me? Go home.

617
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,376
I know you're going through a lot.

618
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:15,680
I know it is tough, George.

619
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,051
But go.
Get your head straight.

620
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:21,352
And listen to me.

621
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:24,756
When you come back,
this will all be here.

622
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:26,570
So don't worry about that.

623
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,132
My brother's coming next week.

624
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:36,446
I want you to meet him.

625
00:44:40,557 --> 00:44:42,320
I think you'll really like him.

626
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:45,725
Next week, huh?

627
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,774
<i>Where were you?</i>

628
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,999
Fucking perfect.

629
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,166
Hey. Where were you?

630
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:12,970
I was out for a drink,
is that alright?

631
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,339
Well, what's wrong?

632
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:15,403
<i>Nothing.</i>

633
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:16,618
Something's wrong.

634
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:19,112
Everything.

635
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:22,711
Go to bed. Come on.

636
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,779
Wanna watch some TV.

637
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:25,948
You need to go to bed.

638
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:27,060
Uh-huh.

639
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:47,563
One time.

640
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:49,209
One fucking time.

641
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,841
Do it!

642
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,940
Fuckin' do it, George!

643
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,926
Honey?

644
00:47:19,983 --> 00:47:21,935
This is the place.

645
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:23,869
Dixon coming?

646
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:25,251
I didn't call that prick.

647
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:43,957
Two beers!

648
00:47:44,057 --> 00:47:46,155
<i>Alright.</i>

649
00:47:46,255 --> 00:47:48,026
<i>Here you go, gorgeous.</i>

650
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,293
Is this a gay bar?

651
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:55,301
Come on, broaden your horizons, buddy!

652
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:57,303
What are you doing?

653
00:47:57,403 --> 00:47:58,979
One beer.

654
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,068
Hey.

655
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,489
Come here often?

656
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:21,893
That the best you can do?

657
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:24,897
First time.

658
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:27,745
I forgive you.

659
00:48:29,786 --> 00:48:30,878
Thanks.

660
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:37,307
Well, I don't forgive you.

661
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:40,909
What?

662
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:43,714
You like sucking dick. Right?

663
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:47,383
You two riding the Hershey highway.

664
00:48:47,483 --> 00:48:48,517
Excuse me?

665
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:50,686
Huh? The sausage pony?

666
00:48:50,786 --> 00:48:52,754
Fuck you, buddy!

667
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:55,491
You like that shit, don't you?

668
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:58,762
Pretty convenient,
don't you think? Huh?

669
00:48:58,862 --> 00:49:01,863
You just drink a little cum and
you get to stay here.

670
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:04,668
While I go off and die! Huh?

671
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:07,803
<i>I think all of you pussy-ass
cock sucking motherfuckers...</i>

672
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,708
Alright, buddy, come on down.

673
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:12,307
Fuck yourselves all the way to Iraq!

674
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,644
Fuck you!

675
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:14,613
<i>Oh my God I</i>

676
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:17,814
No! No!

677
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,665
Get the fuck off me!
You faggot mother...

678
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:30,026
Here you go, man.

679
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:31,102
Thanks.

680
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:37,148
<i>What'd you have to go
and call him for?</i>

681
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,221
How come you don't have a
scratch on you?

682
00:49:57,321 --> 00:49:59,157
I had like ten guys on me.

683
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:03,663
Sorry for getting you involved.
It was my fault.

684
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:05,794
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

685
00:50:05,894 --> 00:50:08,942
Call your wife yet?

686
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:13,004
No.

687
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:15,080
No, man.
I can't let her see me like this.

688
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,176
Let's go.

689
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:19,728
Fuck you.

690
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,044
What's the sausage pony?

691
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:44,470
Yeah, dude.
Motherfucker, you.

692
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,614
<i>What the fuck
Is this guy doing?</i>

693
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:55,177
I went skydiving.

694
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:57,847
What's that?
Number eight?

695
00:50:57,947 --> 00:51:00,869
<i>Number six.</i>

696
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:03,117
It was awesome.

697
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:05,923
I can't see you doing it.

698
00:51:06,023 --> 00:51:08,157
I think I'd pay fucking money
to see you do it.

699
00:51:08,257 --> 00:51:10,426
We should totally do it!

700
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,431
<i>Before we go.</i>

701
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:13,966
Right.

702
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,002
<i>You guys remember the girl
from the bar?</i>

703
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:20,203
When I was a mumblin'
stumblin' idiot?

704
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:22,053
Loser.

705
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,908
After all that shit we did.

706
00:51:26,008 --> 00:51:28,144
She think this is going somewhere?

707
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:33,051
You know, I'll fuck it up somehow.

708
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:34,852
Oh, I thought you already did.

709
00:51:34,952 --> 00:51:37,188
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>

710
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:40,436
She know you're leaving?

711
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:50,646
Yoo hoo!

712
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:55,103
<i>Walt, we're getting on the boat?</i>

713
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:56,238
Let's go.

714
00:51:56,338 --> 00:51:57,725
Make the jump.

715
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:02,711
That's it.

716
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:04,250
You said this was gonna be fun.

717
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,097
<i>We're gonna have
a blast, let's go.</i>

718
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,269
It's been a while, huh?

719
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:28,836
So how's work, buddy?

720
00:52:28,936 --> 00:52:32,417
<i>Well, I told some
client to fuck off.</i>

721
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:35,614
I've done worse.

722
00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:36,460
<i>Like?</i>

723
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:40,981
What do you mean, like?

724
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:43,151
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

725
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:46,490
Come on.

726
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,089
<i>Yeah, come on.</i>

727
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:50,669
<i>I'm kinda curious
about that myself.</i>

728
00:52:53,483 --> 00:52:56,368
Look at you, fuck.
Are you serious?

729
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:57,403
<i>Yeah.</i>

730
00:52:57,503 --> 00:52:59,067
Alright.

731
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,771
I'll go if you guys go.

732
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:02,847
Fine.

733
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,579
The worse thing I ever did...

734
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,317
was I threatened to kill my father.

735
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,221
<i>In high school, he was drinking</i>

736
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,556
<i>and I'm coming home
with all that shit.</i>

737
00:53:18,656 --> 00:53:20,390
<i>My mom worked these
shitty fucking jobs</i>

738
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,928
sometimes two at a time.

739
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:25,060
She worked all night,

740
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,129
<i>and this guy would just blow
all our fucking money</i>

741
00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:31,868
<i>on liquor, hookers.
One time I was 16,</i>

742
00:53:31,968 --> 00:53:35,003
I hear him coming up the steps.

743
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:39,011
He's drunk. He fucking stinks.

744
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:43,381
He comes through the door.

745
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,385
I just snapped.

746
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:50,119
I said that 'If you ever come back,

747
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:53,626
'if you ever try to
talk to my mother again,

748
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:55,337
I'll kill you.'

749
00:53:56,946 --> 00:54:01,063
<i>And the thing was,
is that, I meant it.</i>

750
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:03,602
I did.
I wanted to kill him.

751
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,483
Right then.

752
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:11,508
<i>That was it. Haven't heard
from the guy since.</i>

753
00:54:11,608 --> 00:54:14,222
I'd be proud if I did that.

754
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,597
Come on.

755
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:25,787
I'm a fraud.

756
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,761
<i>Sorry, you're what?</i>

757
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:32,698
<i>You're a frog?</i>

758
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:35,046
<i>I plagiarized my book.</i>

759
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:41,639
<i>I was traveling around Malaysia</i>

760
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:42,872
<i>after I got my Masters.</i>

761
00:54:42,972 --> 00:54:46,474
I was working at this farm place,

762
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,178
hanging out with these guys.

763
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:53,118
Every night, these guys would
sit around the fire

764
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:57,089
and tell these stories.
It was like the Dark Ages.

765
00:54:57,189 --> 00:55:00,891
Really, like all these amazing stories.

766
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:04,695
Well, one night the
guy I was working for,

767
00:55:04,795 --> 00:55:06,699
told this story about a young boy

768
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:11,001
who went into this volcano
to save his sister.

769
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,250
It was the most amazing thing
I'd ever heard in my life.

770
00:55:17,493 --> 00:55:22,077
<i>So, I kinda took it.</i>

771
00:55:22,177 --> 00:55:26,884
I mean, I tweaked it and
set it in Alaska, but...

772
00:55:26,984 --> 00:55:29,388
That's where I got the idea.

773
00:55:29,488 --> 00:55:31,133
You are a fraud.

774
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,725
Fuck you guys!
I still have to write it!

775
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:39,895
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

776
00:55:39,995 --> 00:55:42,041
Did the old man get residuals?

777
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,186
Unbelievable.

778
00:55:47,657 --> 00:55:50,137
Alright, you now what?
It's your turn.

779
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:51,908
<i>Yeah, come on, lawyer boy,
cough it up.</i>

780
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:52,709
<i>No.</i>

781
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:53,875
Cough it up.

782
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,545
I've never really done anything.

783
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,881
<i>Bullshit.</i>

784
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,853
Tonight was a new low,
don't you think?

785
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:03,221
<i>I'd be lying If I said
I didn't agree.</i>

786
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:06,225
Something tells me there's a
skeleton in the closet there

787
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,424
that's a little bit worse.

788
00:56:08,524 --> 00:56:10,429
<i>Alright.</i>

789
00:56:10,529 --> 00:56:12,931
Alright.

790
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:15,563
When we leave this boat,

791
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:19,268
this conversation never happened.
Okay?

792
00:56:19,368 --> 00:56:21,619
Okay.

793
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:26,812
You guys remember Jessica Hendrix?

794
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:29,376
<i>Yeah, Tommy's
little sister.</i>

795
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:30,714
She was cute.

796
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:32,814
I don't know if you
guys remember, but...

797
00:56:32,914 --> 00:56:37,120
she was really advanced
for her age.

798
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,856
<i>She always seemed
a bit older, right?</i>

799
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:43,160
<i>Well, one day I'm hanging out
at Tommy's house.</i>

800
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,532
It was me and, uh, four other guys.

801
00:56:47,632 --> 00:56:49,968
<i>We wanted to drink
some beer and stuff.</i>

802
00:56:50,068 --> 00:56:53,472
<i>So we flipped for it and Tommy
loses so he's gotta get it</i>

803
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:58,674
but the only place we know where
to get it is really far away.

804
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:02,197
So we all pitch in and Tommy leaves.

805
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:06,383
And while we're there,

806
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:08,483
Jessica comes home.

807
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,991
<i>And one of the guys
starts playing with her,</i>

808
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:14,926
you know, tickling her,
and saying stuff,

809
00:57:15,026 --> 00:57:19,060
like, 'Show us your tits' and 'I'll
show you mine if you show me yours.'

810
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,367
Playing. Little stuff like that.
Flirting. And she played back.

811
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:26,670
And then he lifts up her shirt.

812
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:30,089
<i>Then he lifts up her bra.</i>

813
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:35,346
And then one of the other guys...

814
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:37,316
got on the floor with them.

815
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,913
And took her pants off.

816
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:43,186
<i>And she was kicking him,
and she's yelling,</i>

817
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:46,922
<i>but they're holding her mouth
so she can't scream.</i>

818
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:50,294
They start yelling to me,
'Fuck her, come on,

819
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:52,629
Do it, get down here! Do it!
Fuck her!'

820
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:55,797
Don't fuckin' tell me
you fuckin' did that.

821
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,443
<i>I didn't.</i>

822
00:57:59,255 --> 00:58:01,904
I didn't. I swear to God,
I didn't.

823
00:58:02,004 --> 00:58:05,439
I got up out of there and I ran!

824
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:07,723
I ran away, and...

825
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,393
and I left her there.

826
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,475
I left her there with
those fuckin' guys.

827
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:40,684
Listen, I'm really sorry.

828
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:51,458
But I feel like I don't have
any other choices.

829
00:59:53,235 --> 00:59:54,951
My father hasn't come through.

830
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:56,868
I don't know what else to do.

831
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:01,426
They might die over there.

832
01:00:01,526 --> 01:00:02,557
I might die over there.

833
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:03,961
Well, we need a little realism.

834
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:05,104
I know.

835
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:14,138
<i>Meantime,
officials here in New York,</i>

836
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:17,305
<i>say they are prepared to handle
the Influx of protesters</i>

837
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,942
<i>coming to attend next weekend's
anti-war march.</i>

838
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:25,648
<i>NYPD plans to deploy twice the normal
amount of officers to watch over the event.</i>

839
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:30,718
<i>Planners say they expect well more
than a million people to attend.</i>

840
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:34,024
<i>The war remains the hotspot
area for voters.</i>

841
01:00:34,124 --> 01:00:37,192
<i>New poll numbers show that the war
was ranked the most Important Issue</i>

842
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:41,065
<i>by a four to one margin.
The economy was a distant second,</i>

843
01:00:41,165 --> 01:00:44,119
<i>followed by the cost of education.</i>

844
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:55,757
I got drafted.

845
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:13,013
I got drafted.

846
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:28,654
Okay.

847
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:34,799
When do you leave?

848
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,747
I leave on...
I leave on Saturday.

849
01:01:57,026 --> 01:01:59,153
That's when I leave.
I leave on Saturday.

850
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,631
Wait. What?

851
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:09,400
How long have you known about this?

852
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,121
Since I met you.

853
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:15,493
Jesus.

854
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:16,806
Oh.

855
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:26,985
How could you not tell me?!

856
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:46,903
What if they don't like me?

857
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:50,824
I bet the first ones to die

858
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:52,493
are the ones that nobody likes.

859
01:02:52,593 --> 01:02:57,109
And I feel like I'm one of those guys.

860
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,873
How long have you been coming to me?

861
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:05,675
I don't know.

862
01:03:05,775 --> 01:03:07,524
<i>Seven years.</i>

863
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:10,715
I guess.

864
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:14,292
<i>After seven years, I think it's
time we tried something new.</i>

865
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:23,295
<i>These will help you sleep.</i>

866
01:03:23,395 --> 01:03:27,509
<i>You don't need a psychiatrist
and just be yourself.</i>

867
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:38,385
Look at me.

868
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:51,955
Hey, baby.

869
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:54,805
Does Alice make you feel all right?

870
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,664
<i>What do you want, motherfucker?</i>

871
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:04,669
<i>Uh...</i>

872
01:04:04,769 --> 01:04:05,766
Speak, bitch.

873
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,604
Dallas, she said.

874
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:10,007
<i>Fifty bucks,
fifteen minutes.</i>

875
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,491
Alright.

876
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,413
<i>Fifteen.</i>

877
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:21,953
One motherfucking second more,

878
01:04:22,053 --> 01:04:23,488
you in another fifty.

879
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:25,422
Come on!

880
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:28,305
Come on.

881
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,235
Relax, baby.

882
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,689
Alice is gonna make you feel good.

883
01:05:12,154 --> 01:05:13,382
Oh, sugar.

884
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,567
Thanks.

885
01:05:34,176 --> 01:05:35,459
Night, baby.

886
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:36,511
Night.

887
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:44,067
<i>Where you goin', bitch?</i>

888
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,267
What?

889
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:47,401
Another fifty, motherfucker.

890
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:49,957
I was only in there for,
like, two minutes!

891
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:53,794
Hey!

892
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:01,029
Fucker!

893
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,896
Are you okay? Huh? You hurt?

894
01:06:13,996 --> 01:06:17,166
<i>Relax, I want you to tell me
exactly what happened.</i>

895
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,636
Don't lie, don't embellish.

896
01:06:18,736 --> 01:06:20,211
Tell me exactly what happened.

897
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:24,174
<i>That's the guy?</i>

898
01:06:24,274 --> 01:06:25,851
I don't know.

899
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,180
Alright.

900
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,244
You ready?

901
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:32,346
<i>What?</i>

902
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:33,413
Just walk by me.

903
01:06:33,513 --> 01:06:36,787
Oh! No.

904
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:39,257
No, I'm staying here.

905
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:42,322
Jesus Christ.

906
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:44,228
You wanna wait here?

907
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:45,746
<i>Please.</i>

908
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:48,342
Wait over there.

909
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:03,880
You got a problem, mother...?

910
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,730
Let's get something straight.

911
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,931
You like that?

912
01:07:20,031 --> 01:07:22,882
A deal's a fuckin' deal, asshole.

913
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:27,672
That was so cool!

914
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:29,140
I don't fuckin' need this shit.

915
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,541
But you wrecked that guy.

916
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:31,874
I don't fuckin' need this shit.

917
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:33,440
You wrecked that guy! That was...

918
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,879
Listen, man!

919
01:07:34,979 --> 01:07:36,977
You fuckin' think I like
doin' shit like this?

920
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:39,046
Fuckin' answer me, you think
I like this shit?

921
01:07:39,146 --> 01:07:40,484
I don't know.

922
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:43,617
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck are you doin', man?

923
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:45,753
What the fuck are you doin'
with this guy?

924
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,922
Man, we are fuckin' leavin' soon.

925
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,124
This is what you're doin'?

926
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:50,595
You don't understand.

927
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:52,529
I don't fuckin' understand?
Tell me.

928
01:07:52,629 --> 01:07:54,566
Man, you take a fuckin' walk.

929
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:56,697
<i>You can't leave me here</i>

930
01:07:56,797 --> 01:07:58,866
You put me in this fuckin' position!

931
01:07:58,966 --> 01:08:01,035
Come on! Dixon!

932
01:08:01,135 --> 01:08:04,456
Dixon, I'm sorr...
Dixon!

933
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:15,742
Guys, come on, I wanna go home.

934
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:18,994
Hey, buddy. It's us. We're here.
Where are you?

935
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:23,086
We're worried. Give us a call.

936
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:24,605
Alright?

937
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:28,634
<i>Probably working
on number 10.</i>

938
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:33,294
Yeah, he's a little out of control.

939
01:09:33,394 --> 01:09:34,474
<i>A little?</i>

940
01:09:37,252 --> 01:09:39,152
Where you at right now?

941
01:09:41,423 --> 01:09:42,773
You still not gonna go?

942
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:48,077
It's just this whole thing
is so wrong.

943
01:09:48,177 --> 01:09:49,446
I just know it.

944
01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:52,816
We're making new enemies every day.

945
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:54,915
And it's a war we can't win.

946
01:09:55,015 --> 01:09:57,455
Whoa, you don't know that.

947
01:09:57,555 --> 01:09:59,404
I don't know it?

948
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:01,900
I believe it.

949
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,330
I believe you. I do.

950
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,801
I absolutely believe you.

951
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,269
But you need to know

952
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:13,704
that I believe it's
the right thing to do.

953
01:10:13,804 --> 01:10:17,006
I do, man. I think that if we
don't do this now,

954
01:10:17,106 --> 01:10:18,672
it's gonna be too late.

955
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:20,273
Nothing left to fight for.

956
01:10:20,373 --> 01:10:22,944
'Cause as soon as they
can kill us, they will.

957
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,450
As soon as they get nukes,
that's it, it's over, man.

958
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,149
I'm gonna tell you something else.

959
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:30,603
New York City, right here,
we're gonna be first.

960
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:34,321
<i>Look, I...</i>

961
01:10:34,421 --> 01:10:36,923
I'm basically a fuck-up.

962
01:10:37,023 --> 01:10:38,862
I know that. I do.

963
01:10:38,962 --> 01:10:41,664
But I believe...

964
01:10:41,764 --> 01:10:44,967
I believe in this
place and all of it.

965
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:49,373
And the thing is, is that,
I choose to drive that cab.

966
01:10:49,473 --> 01:10:53,176
I... I choose to be your friend.

967
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:55,714
I choose, right now,
I am choosing to be in this bar.

968
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:57,215
And that's the point, man.

969
01:10:57,315 --> 01:10:59,717
That's... that's what's
at stake, that's...

970
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:01,618
it's choice, it's freedom.

971
01:11:01,718 --> 01:11:04,217
It's freedom to be
whatever the fuck you wanna be,

972
01:11:04,317 --> 01:11:05,555
even if it is a fuck-up.

973
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:07,525
I mean, we're...

974
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:11,659
we're in a fight,
for a way of life.

975
01:11:11,759 --> 01:11:13,874
And that's what I believe.

976
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,767
Aaron Feller,
reporting for duty, sir.

977
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:43,769
You stand up.
You stand up and you fight.

978
01:11:46,548 --> 01:11:48,027
<i>You fight.</i>

979
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:51,097
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

980
01:11:51,197 --> 01:11:52,469
Are you with me?

981
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:56,873
Good.
Let's take 'em down.

982
01:11:56,973 --> 01:11:59,483
Let's take 'em down!

983
01:12:02,397 --> 01:12:04,058
I would die for you.

984
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:08,566
I would die for you, sir.

985
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,819
I would die for you.

986
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:15,240
Would I die for you?

987
01:12:39,468 --> 01:12:41,948
<i>If you're watching thls,</i>

988
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:44,051
<i>then I didn't make it.</i>

989
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,957
<i>Either that or I did make it</i>

990
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:51,672
<i>to the five-year mark and we can
have a good laugh together.</i>

991
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,481
<i>I tried, but...</i>

992
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,141
<i>It just wasn't meant to be.</i>

993
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:08,045
<i>I'm okay with that,
'cause I got to know you.</i>

994
01:13:08,145 --> 01:13:10,880
<i>You were a part of my life.</i>

995
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:14,549
<i>Baby, I don't know
many people in this world</i>

996
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:17,218
<i>who would've stood beside
someone the way you did.</i>

997
01:13:17,318 --> 01:13:19,786
<i>You had your whole
life ahead of you,</i>

998
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:23,694
<i>and... you didn't leave
me for a second.</i>

999
01:13:23,794 --> 01:13:27,030
<i>And I know
that we'll never get to do...</i>

1000
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,297
<i>all the things...</i>

1001
01:13:29,397 --> 01:13:30,964
<i>all the things
that we talked about,</i>

1002
01:13:31,064 --> 01:13:36,002
<i>but, I love you
so much.</i>

1003
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:37,407
<i>No matter where I am</i>

1004
01:13:37,507 --> 01:13:40,290
<i>I will always be with you.</i>

1005
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:15,621
I am not supposed to leave you.

1006
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:25,931
Fuck!

1007
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:40,471
So... when do you go?

1008
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:45,477
Tomorrow.

1009
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:48,147
Wow.

1010
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,329
Will you do something for me?

1011
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,697
Come here.

1012
01:16:13,648 --> 01:16:16,549
See this?
These are my Dad's.

1013
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:24,073
He fought in something
called the Korean War.

1014
01:16:24,173 --> 01:16:25,057
Know what that is?

1015
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,898
It's kinda like what we're doing now.

1016
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:36,393
Now listen.

1017
01:16:38,273 --> 01:16:40,241
I want you to hang on
to these for me, okay?

1018
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:46,676
Hey, I'm gonna come back.

1019
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,597
I'm gonna get those from you.

1020
01:16:50,697 --> 01:16:53,936
Okay? So you don't lose them.

1021
01:16:54,036 --> 01:16:55,372
No?

1022
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:56,908
No.

1023
01:16:57,008 --> 01:16:59,586
You know if you do,
I'm gonna kick your ass, right?

1024
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:04,692
Come on. Be strong.

1025
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,998
Shhh. Be strong.

1026
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:18,776
Be strong.

1027
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,468
<i>First state your name and your rank.</i>

1028
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:30,806
<i>First lieutenant Kevin Tilder.</i>

1029
01:17:30,906 --> 01:17:32,540
<i>You've had command of what?</i>

1030
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,480
<i>Bradley Platoon
consisting of 39 soldiers.</i>

1031
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,265
<i>39 soldiers,
M2A2's Bradley fighting vehicles</i>

1032
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,619
<i>The other night you and
your crew were Involved</i>

1033
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,421
<i>In some pretty heavy action.
Do you want to explain that?</i>

1034
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:49,090
<i>We were on our way back
from a five-hour mission.</i>

1035
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,531
<i>Drop clearance on what we do</i>

1036
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,563
<i>particularly roadside bombs,
improvised explosive devices.</i>

1037
01:17:57,663 --> 01:18:04,070
<i>IED's, enemy ambushes. We were on
our way back as... it was 3:30 AM,</i>

1038
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:07,140
<i>and my vehicle got hit
by an IED,</i>

1039
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,177
<i>and destroyed tires,
windshield,</i>

1040
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:14,167
<i>the engine, radio station.
After that...</i>

1041
01:18:22,143 --> 01:18:24,325
<i>The Iraqi police that
were on patrol with us,</i>

1042
01:18:24,425 --> 01:18:25,830
<i>they were stuck
In the kill zone.</i>

1043
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,461
<i>What do we want?</i>

1044
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:28,832
<i>Peace</i>

1045
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:30,633
'What do you want?'

1046
01:18:30,733 --> 01:18:33,210
'Peace!'

1047
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,956
You know what it is.

1048
01:18:57,056 --> 01:19:00,763
It's the first generation
not to grow up with the draft.

1049
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,044
You don't know war,
no draft, nothing.

1050
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,089
Yeah, we had it pretty easy.

1051
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:11,742
It had to end sometime.

1052
01:19:11,842 --> 01:19:13,339
Hey, guys.

1053
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:14,609
What's up, man?

1054
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,878
Holy shit.

1055
01:19:16,978 --> 01:19:18,146
How you doin', Aaron?

1056
01:19:18,246 --> 01:19:19,211
Huh?

1057
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,585
Are you okay?

1058
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:24,285
I'm fine.

1059
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,791
<i>You sure?</i>

1060
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:28,158
Yeah.

1061
01:19:28,258 --> 01:19:31,128
<i>I gotta tell ya, man,</i>

1062
01:19:31,228 --> 01:19:33,962
it seems like...

1063
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:37,266
you're going off the deep end
a little bit.

1064
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:39,934
You do your thing, I'll do mine.

1065
01:19:40,034 --> 01:19:41,337
<i>Why you saying that?</i>

1066
01:19:41,437 --> 01:19:43,706
We're in this together,
you know that.

1067
01:19:43,806 --> 01:19:45,338
I don't need any help.

1068
01:19:45,438 --> 01:19:47,075
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1069
01:19:47,175 --> 01:19:49,412
We're asking.

1070
01:19:49,512 --> 01:19:51,044
Fuck you guys, alright?

1071
01:19:51,144 --> 01:19:52,347
Hey!

1072
01:19:52,447 --> 01:19:54,901
Whoa!

1073
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:57,952
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1074
01:19:58,052 --> 01:19:59,457
<i>Whoa!</i>

1075
01:19:59,557 --> 01:20:01,532
<i>Aaron. What are you doin', man?</i>

1076
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:05,041
You gonna be there?

1077
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:15,071
7 A.M. Penn Station.
Peace.

1078
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,305
Come on, let's go.

1079
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,562
I gotta tell you something.

1080
01:20:42,662 --> 01:20:44,000
What's up?

1081
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,904
I need you to know,
no matter what you decide,

1082
01:20:48,004 --> 01:20:52,449
I get it, man.
I'm cool. I get it.

1083
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:56,060
I'm with you no matter what.

1084
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:59,456
Yeah?

1085
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:03,301
Thank you, man.
Thank you.

1086
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:09,592
Thank you.

1087
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:11,190
Yeah.

1088
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,259
You sleep well tonight, alright?

1089
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:14,962
You too, buddy.

1090
01:21:15,062 --> 01:21:16,264
I will.

1091
01:21:16,364 --> 01:21:17,579
Alright.

1092
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:01,678
<i>Hello.</i>

1093
01:22:01,778 --> 01:22:05,880
<i>Hello?
Is someone there?</i>

1094
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:08,435
It's A... it's Aaron.

1095
01:22:10,405 --> 01:22:11,394
It's me.

1096
01:22:14,342 --> 01:22:18,438
<i>Wow. Where are you these days?</i>

1097
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:21,994
<i>Huh?</i>

1098
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:23,948
I'm in New York City.

1099
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:27,435
<i>Yeah.</i>

1100
01:22:27,535 --> 01:22:30,908
How are you?

1101
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:33,444
How's Mom and Dad?

1102
01:22:33,544 --> 01:22:37,280
<i>Dad had a heart attack last year.</i>

1103
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:43,653
<i>He's okay now.
But he had a rough time.</i>

1104
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:45,433
I got drafted.

1105
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:48,933
<i>Really?</i>

1106
01:22:51,546 --> 01:22:53,480
<i>Well, good luck with that.</i>

1107
01:23:11,866 --> 01:23:14,515
<i>You've reached Molly and George.</i>

1108
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,628
<i>Please leave a message
and we'll call you back.</i>

1109
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,291
<i>George?</i>

1110
01:23:21,391 --> 01:23:23,558
<i>Great news!</i>

1111
01:23:23,658 --> 01:23:25,826
<i>Senator Boone came through.</i>

1112
01:23:25,926 --> 01:23:28,332
<i>He's gonna help
you get out of it.</i>

1113
01:23:28,432 --> 01:23:30,632
<i>You don't have
to report tomorrow.</i>

1114
01:23:30,732 --> 01:23:33,800
<i>Will you call me
when you get a chance, son?</i>

1115
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:36,914
<i>Love you.
Call me.</i>

1116
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:36,711
<i>I'll stay for you
If you ask me to.</i>

1117
01:24:39,687 --> 01:24:41,621
No, you wouldn't.

1118
01:25:00,108 --> 01:25:01,803
I will wait for you.

1119
01:25:04,812 --> 01:25:05,904
I'll wait.

1120
01:25:20,661 --> 01:25:22,959
What else am I supposed to do?

1121
01:25:24,298 --> 01:25:25,925
I love you.

1122
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:33,807
I love you too.

1123
01:25:45,453 --> 01:25:47,978
If you decide to go then,

1124
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:52,158
I don't know what I'll do.

1125
01:25:53,594 --> 01:25:55,323
But I'll be okay.

1126
01:26:01,569 --> 01:26:03,285
We can't plan everything.

1127
01:26:03,385 --> 01:26:05,464
Some things just happen.

1128
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:15,743
You think I'm a good person?

1129
01:29:13,028 --> 01:29:18,078
THE END
