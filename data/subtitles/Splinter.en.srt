1
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,460
Go on. I ain't got nothin'. Psst!

2
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,002
Sweet Jesus!

3
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,304
Oh, God! No! No! No!

4
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:39,947
<i>Yeah,
this is definitely our campsite.</i>

5
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:47,332
- So...
- So we're here. Come on.

6
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,492
Can you help me with this?

7
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:56,548
Here. Over there, by the fire pit.

8
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:59,718
- Oh, here, here, here, here.
- Oh, yeah. You need that.

9
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,880
Need the hatchet.

10
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:17,103
- Thank you for doing this.
- I was made for camping.

11
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,237
- This is, like, my thing.
- Hm-hm.

12
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,028
- What? Oh, really?
- Hm-hm.

13
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:25,242
- You know what?
- What?

14
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,867
- I think I'm gonna like camping.
- Yeah?

15
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:30,033
- Hm-hm.
- I told you.

16
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,747
Ow! Wait a minute.

17
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:40,843
- Did you get the bug stuff?
- Come on. Let's get this tent up.

18
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,004
Come on.

19
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,553
Shit, shit, shit.

20
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:58,019
- The engine's fucking destroyed.
- This ain't how you talked it, D.

21
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:02,110
Mexico is just around the corner,
sweetheart. Come on.

22
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:03,944
It's not.

23
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:08,115
Well, this truck ain't getting us
any closer, alright? Let's go.

24
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,622
- Mine's in.
- It can't be. I... Hold on.

25
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:18,382
- Well, just hold that. Just trust me.
- OK.

26
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,302
- Hey, got it.
- OK, mine's in.

27
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:23,959
Ow! Well, now mine's not.

28
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:25,798
- Are you OK?
- This is...

29
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:29,425
- Are you sure you got the right hole?
- OK, is this the right pole?

30
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,387
- Look how short that pole is.
- Yeah, it's... Yeah.

31
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:36,187
I'm starting to think
we're not wilderness people.

32
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:39,858
Of course we are.
We can't let this tent beat us, OK?

33
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:43,646
You always say we have to be smarter
than what we're working against.

34
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:46,447
You know what I'm definitely
smarter than? A motel.

35
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,906
No. You can't see the stars
from a motel. And that wasn't the deal.

36
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:53,781
The deal was anniversary sex
under the stars.

37
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,504
OK, that part sounds kind of familiar.

38
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,040
Alright, hold your end.
I'll get this in.

39
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,922
- OK.
- You ready? You got it?

40
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,259
OK.

41
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,552
Oh!

42
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,807
Are you kidding me?

43
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,141
Tell me you remembered the spare tent.

44
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>No.</i>

45
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,119
Come here. Come here.

46
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,571
Motel. Motel. Motel.

47
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:34,033
Come on. Come on!

48
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,002
OK.

49
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,970
What are you doing?

50
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:56,009
Hey, D. That's all our stuff.

51
00:07:56,105 --> 00:08:00,601
We're getting all new stuff, baby.
All new stuff.

52
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,612
Hey, who's the cowgirl, huh?

53
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,269
I fucking hate it when you call me that.

54
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:12,535
Hey, there's my cowgirl. There she is.

55
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,081
Let's go.

56
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:20,545
Just gotta hang on a little while
longer. We're almost fucking there.

57
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:25,963
Who's my lady Lacey, huh?

58
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:31,723
There you are, baby. Just gotta hang on
a little while fucking longer, alright?

59
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:41,105
- Do you realise how old this forest is?
- No. Please tell me.

60
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:47,148
The whole area mostly sucks for logging,
so these trees are completely untouched.

61
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,731
Some of them are 400 years old,
maybe more.

62
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:53,195
- Really?
- They just grow older and older.

63
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:57,701
You know, if you spent half as much time
in nature as you do reading about it,

64
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:01,043
we'd be cuddling
under the stars tonight.

65
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,205
Cuddling.

66
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,208
Hey, come on.

67
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:14,256
Now we get to spend our anniversary
basking in the glow of free cable TV.

68
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,767
Next year we're camping.

69
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:19,432
- Alright.
- OK.

70
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:52,424
See that tree right there? That's a post
oak, a 300-year-old tree at least.

71
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:55,432
Baby, could we please
just have a moment of silence,

72
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:58,269
you know, to mourn the loss of our tent?

73
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:01,602
OK. Look at the positives here
for two seconds. Just go with me.

74
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,145
- OK.
- We get to stay at a ghetto-ass motel.

75
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:07,686
There's gonna be bugs everywhere.
The AC will probably be broken.

76
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:11,562
It's gonna be every bit as uncomfortable
as sleeping in the wilderness.

77
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:15,277
- So why are you complaining?
- Will there be holes in the sheets?

78
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,039
We won't stop
until we find a place that does.

79
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:21,907
- Or I'll poke holes in them myself.
- I love you.

80
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:26,203
Oh! Look at that tree. That's gotta be
at least 400 years old, right?

81
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,918
- Look how big that one is.
- That's an old tree.

82
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:33,302
I'd say closer to 100 or 200.
See it has stumps halfway up?

83
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:36,591
You're gonna laugh at me?
You're gonna laugh at me when I'm...

84
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:39,886
I think you're cute.
It's adorable when you talk about trees.

85
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:42,682
I'm not gonna talk about 'em any more.

86
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:48,062
<i>What the?</i>

87
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:54,993
Did you?

88
00:10:55,661 --> 00:11:00,072
- What's she doing out here by herself?
- She looks... not right.

89
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:02,495
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Hm.

90
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,000
- She's coming up here.
- I don't know. I think it's weird.

91
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,418
<i>- It's OK. Go.
- Maybe he's with her.</i>

92
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:11,216
- No, thank you.
- I don't know.

93
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,713
- Oh, my God, Seth.
- Are you fucking deaf?

94
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,558
- Whoa, whoa!
- Out of the fucking car now. Out.

95
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:24,100
- Baby, no!
- We're good, baby. We're good.

96
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,308
<i>Turn it off. Get out of the car.</i>

97
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,402
Nice and easy, alright?
Get out of the car.

98
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:34,567
- Just... Just...
- Get out of the fucking car now!

99
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:36,696
- Oh, God!
- OK, OK.

100
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,741
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

101
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,366
Clear the back seat.
Make room for two more.

102
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:44,326
No, D, you can't change the plan.
You said no hostages.

103
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,288
I know what I said, baby.
I know what I said. Listen to me.

104
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,917
Plat's 40 miles up the road.

105
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:53,457
The bank's closed. It don't open
till 8am. Listen to me. Trust me.

106
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,672
We're gonna do this right.
Come here. Come here.

107
00:11:56,763 --> 00:12:00,096
Listen to me. You gotta trust me, OK?
You trust me? You trust me?

108
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,756
OK, give me a kiss.

109
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:13,230
OK, go get in the front seat.
Let's go, kid.

110
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,524
That's twice.

111
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:19,693
OK.

112
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,741
- Up.
- Oh, God. God.

113
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:27,370
- You, around the front. Drive.
- I can drive.

114
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,830
- I wasn't talking to you. Drive.
- What? I can't...

115
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:34,006
- Drive the fucking car!
- I can't drive stick, OK?

116
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:39,168
Fuck! Get in the fucking car.

117
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:42,597
Hands on the wheel,
off the fucking locks.

118
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:45,519
You, in back, over here.
Lacey's up front.

119
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:48,059
Go on. Step in there, Lacey.

120
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,850
Get in the fucking car.

121
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,611
Everybody nice and fucking comfy now?

122
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:04,076
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah. I'm cold.

123
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:08,162
OK, OK. Just relax, just relax.
Let's go.

124
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,964
- OK, OK.
- What's the problem? Yeah? OK?

125
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,125
OK. Uh-uh.

126
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,390
Wallets and cellphone, give 'em up.

127
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:42,951
- Same page, friend?
- Seth, just give him the damn thing.

128
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,740
Yeah, just give it to me, Seth.

129
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,508
Jesus. Five bucks?
Don't anybody carry cash any more?

130
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:10,018
Here, baby. Take that. See if you can
find anything for you in there.

131
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,735
Seth Turner. Polly Watt.

132
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:22,275
Same address, different names.
Hm. Not married?

133
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:26,118
- Living together in sin?
- Come on, Dennis.

134
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,493
That ain't your business, now.

135
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,118
Student ID. A little old, ain't you?

136
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,538
- It's a PhD.
- Oh.

137
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,419
- You a doctor?
- Not yet, no.

138
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,888
- But you can do script, huh?
- What?

139
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:50,808
- Can you write prescriptions?
- No. No, it's a biology PhD.

140
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,812
- Lacey.
- OK. Then you ain't a fucking doctor.

141
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:56,350
Great.

142
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,067
Not yet.

143
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:01,520
Where are we going?

144
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:06,407
Just drive till I say different.
This is a dictatorship from here on out.

145
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,902
If you wanna make life easy,
don't talk no more.

146
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:14,168
<i>Shit, what was that?</i>

147
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:15,913
- We hit something.
- What?

148
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,495
Ginger. Ginger.

149
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,591
- Ginger? Ginger's dead, baby.
- We've got a flat tyre.

150
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:25,294
- What the fuck are you trying to do?
- Relax, Lacey. It's gonna be fine.

151
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,006
- Get the spare. You.
- Er...

152
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,849
- Get the spare!
- I'll get it. It's not his car.

153
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,808
It's not my car.

154
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:41,687
You know, you suffer from
a severe case of CDS. Can't do shit.

155
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,575
You think Ginger's OK?
She's just a puppy. Huh?

156
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,745
Hurry up.

157
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,881
Here. Hey, if he moves, shoot him.

158
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,649
Hey, let's go.

159
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,394
OK.

160
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,985
Go.

161
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:45,427
Ginger.

162
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,932
Ginger.

163
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:03,109
OK. It's OK.

164
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:06,065
Momma's here now.
It's gonna be OK, Ginger.

165
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:09,074
OK. You... You gotta help her.

166
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,534
- Please.
- You...

167
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:14,284
- Come on, Biology. Ginger needs you.
- OK. I'm...

168
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,414
I'm pretty sure it's dead.

169
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,760
Here, make this quick. Fit this tyre.

170
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,424
Grab that.

171
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:44,145
Ah! Damn.

172
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,063
What the?

173
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,294
You're gonna help her.

174
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,458
- Come on.
- OK. OK.

175
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,173
OK.

176
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:24,306
It's OK. No, it's OK, lovely.
He's a doctor.

177
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,605
I don't care what Dennis says, OK, baby?

178
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:31,194
We're gonna take you home, OK?
We're gonna save you.

179
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:35,576
What is wrong with her?

180
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,080
- I don't know what...
- Hey, fix it.

181
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:47,038
Alright. Alright.

182
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:59,391
See these? I don't...

183
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:02,721
What is that?

184
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:07,400
Holy shit! Holy motherfucker!

185
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:14,817
- Seth!
- Get that thing on the ground. Lacey!

186
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:19,616
- Baby.
- What happened? You OK? Talk to me.

187
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:23,621
- Shut up!
- Talk to me. Talk to me, Lacey.

188
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,703
<i>- Lacey.
- Get in. Get in!</i>

189
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:29,369
- Did he mess with you?
- Get in! D, get in.

190
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,836
- Get in the car.
- Seth! Seth!

191
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,592
Ah, fuck!

192
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,884
- What happened?
- We gotta get out of here.

193
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,268
- Drive this fucking car!
- What happened?

194
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,563
- I'm not leaving him.
- Oh, fuck! Drive!

195
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,984
- I'm not leaving him.
- Fuck! Come on. Go!

196
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,320
Go, go. OK. Go, go! Drive!

197
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,244
Speed up.

198
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,423
I will blow a hole in you
big enough to watch TV through.

199
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:15,675
- Fucking stop!
- Tell me what's happened, Lace.

200
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:18,336
What happened back there, hm?

201
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,182
She tried to get me.

202
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:23,344
- Who?
- Ginger.

203
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:28,020
- She attacked me with her tail.
- It wasn't Ginger, baby.

204
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:31,606
- Yeah.
- It was some critter from the woods.

205
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,645
Ginger's dead, sweetheart.

206
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,900
You gotta let her go.

207
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,365
God.

208
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:51,962
Did you see anything back there?

209
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,718
When was the last time
you took a hit, Lace? Huh?

210
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,388
- It's not that, D.
- Tell me.

211
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,800
D, I swear to God, it's not that.

212
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:09,223
Hey, I saw some crazy shit.
First two days, I saw shit coming...

213
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:11,936
Baby, it's not that.

214
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:18,819
OK? I ain't had a hit
since day before yesterday.

215
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,317
I ain't seeing a goddamn thing.

216
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,744
She tried to get you with her tail, huh?

217
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,871
Fine. I'm gonna straighten you out.

218
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:31,002
I promise you, if that's the last thing
I do, I'm gonna straighten you out.

219
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:36,541
I'm gonna get you to Mexico, get you
drinks with fucking umbrellas in 'em.

220
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:44,140
Motherfuckin' radiator. Fuck!

221
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:58,811
One sure thing about luck is,
it will change.

222
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,690
Pull over.

223
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:20,632
- Hey, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

224
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,390
Just hold it.
It's only 30 miles to Platt.

225
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,932
I need to go.

226
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:29,640
You told me
you were gonna lay off the stuff.

227
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,102
And you told me fuckin' Mexico.

228
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:36,104
I just don't want you
getting cockeyed on me.

229
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:40,654
This whole fucking world is cockeyed.
I'm not gonna make a fuckin' difference.

230
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,817
Leave it.

231
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:01,548
<i>Turn it off.</i>

232
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:09,008
Tell me you can pump gas.

233
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:15,971
Let's go. Polly Watt,
we're going to buy coolant and crackers.

234
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,700
Keep a cool hand, Luke.

235
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:47,381
Hello?

236
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:00,853
Come on, come on. Fucking... Come on.

237
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,404
Come on.

238
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,863
OK. Come on, you fucking door!

239
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,825
Fuck!

240
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,364
Hello?

241
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:31,056
Fuck!

242
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:52,944
Hello?

243
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,039
They're making this easy, huh?

244
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,682
Fuck!

245
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:31,161
- Sorry. I didn't...
- Kill me.

246
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:42,412
Baby? Baby! Baby!

247
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:45,838
- What's going on?
- There's a man with spikes.

248
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,508
- Spikes?
- No, no, no, no, baby, please.

249
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:52,218
- Just listen!
- Do you even hear yourself talking?

250
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:56,554
Baby, in the bathroom, there's a man!
He's fucking...

251
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,720
What the fuck?

252
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:02,104
Lacey, get back. Lacey, get back!

253
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,019
Lacey!

254
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:08,696
Run!

255
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:11,031
Fuck!

256
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,746
Seth! Seth! Seth!

257
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:19,285
Run! Run! Hurry! Seth!

258
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,578
Get inside!

259
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:30,711
- Lacey!
- Are you OK? What was that?

260
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,806
- It just tore right through her.
- Oh, shit! Lacey!

261
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,637
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

262
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:45,065
No, no, no, no! What are you doing?

263
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:48,983
Don't think what's happening out there
changes who we are in here.

264
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:54,114
- You going to prison bothers me?
- I coulďve killed you. I didn't.

265
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:57,987
Yeah. We see how well
that worked out for you, don't we?

266
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,373
Stupid fuckin' idiot.
Plans don't change.

267
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:09,375
Hey, man.

268
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,625
You ain't no hero, kid.
We both know that.

269
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,845
<i>- Let me see.
- I'm OK.</i>

270
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,480
Are you OK?

271
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,618
Fuck!

272
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:55,721
Are you OK? Let me see.

273
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,442
What are you doing? Hey. Stop it.

274
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,851
She's alive.

275
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:54,519
Are you nuts?
You can't open that door, OK?

276
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:57,865
She's alive. Look.
I can't leave her out there.

277
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,161
No. She's...

278
00:29:10,463 --> 00:29:13,037
Alright.

279
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:20,547
We'll watch the monitor, make sure
that thing on the car doesn't move.

280
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:23,428
You wanna tell me the rest?

281
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:30,516
Well, if...
if it goes to get you or whatever,

282
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:35,021
we're gonna shut that door, we're gonna
lock it and it's gonna stay shut.

283
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:45,659
You're OK.

284
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:19,026
- We can lock him out.
- He's got a gun.

285
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:22,567
- He can shoot through glass.
- Yeah, but he's out of bullets.

286
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,827
- It takes six, right?
- I don't know.

287
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,035
The girl shot two.
How many did he shoot?

288
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,670
What if he has more bullets? No.

289
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:55,441
Baby? Are you alright here, baby?

290
00:30:56,528 --> 00:31:00,359
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

291
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,153
There you go. There you go.

292
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:07,454
- Seth, he's gonna kill us.
- Look, OK.

293
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,448
Just statistically speaking,

294
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,826
most people survive hostage situations
if you just stay calm.

295
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,125
Stay calm!

296
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:19,461
I'm just gonna take you inside,
alright? OK?

297
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,467
Just stay still. Stay still.

298
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,676
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

299
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:30,135
Jesus. She's dead.
He's completely insane.

300
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,432
OK, alright, I'm just gonna
drag you inside. Here we go.

301
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,353
Oh, my God.

302
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:51,748
- Come on.
- Polly, here he comes, OK?

303
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:55,499
Polly, open the door. We're gonna
get through this. Just be calm.

304
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,912
- You don't know that.
- Polly.

305
00:32:00,675 --> 00:32:03,380
- Seth...
- Open the door.

306
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,636
- Open the door!
- Let him in. Polly, let him in.

307
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:09,213
- She's alive! Open the door!
- It's OK.

308
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:12,928
Open the door. He's right there!
Open the fucking door.

309
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,726
One!

310
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:18,935
- Two.
- It's OK. It's OK. No, no, no.

311
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:21,482
<i>Three.</i>

312
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:24,738
Don't! It's attacking him!
Don't open it!

313
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:36,076
<i>No! What is?
Seth, what is? What is that?</i>

314
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:41,671
Get away from it.

315
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:45,044
Seth, come on, man.

316
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:50,384
It's moving.
It's actually moving itself.

317
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,679
It's going for the blood.

318
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,316
- Don't. Come on. Don't.
- Wait.

319
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:26,462
You see this? It's following me.

320
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,675
It's actually following me.

321
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,634
Look at this.

322
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:40,558
Do you see that? It's... It's...

323
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:45,316
It's f...

324
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:50,363
It's metabolising.

325
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:51,945
<i>What?</i>

326
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,076
I can't believe this. I think
it's feeding. It's digesting the blood.

327
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:01,164
See the black stuff right there?
I think that's the waste.

328
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,294
- It was eating her?
- No.

329
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:09,175
It's absorbing...
the nutrients on a cellular...

330
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:11,800
It's more like a mould, I think.

331
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,179
What are you saying?
It feeds on people?

332
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,103
No. It probably feeds on any animal.

333
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:20,105
This is new. I've never seen
anything like this before.

334
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,061
<i>What is it?</i>

335
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:27,110
<i>I think... I think it's stopping.</i>

336
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:34,864
<i>What was that?</i>

337
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:37,030
What was that?

338
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,373
What the fuck?

339
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,519
Er, it's OK.

340
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,815
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't.

341
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:16,909
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't. Come on. Don't.

342
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:20,331
I have to, OK? I have to. Just trust me.
Hey. Hey, man.

343
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,255
Look, you can't help her, OK?
It's not her any more.

344
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,630
Look, come on, man. Please.

345
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:33,967
You should come with us, OK?
Come with us.

346
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:40,016
You gotta come with me now, OK?
It's not her any more, alright?

347
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,976
Go, baby. It's OK.

348
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:46,018
<i>- Seth, come on!
- It's not her. We're coming.</i>

349
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:49,228
It's not her, OK? It's OK. Go. Go.

350
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:57,110
Help me get this open.

351
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,206
OK. Alright.

352
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,077
Shit! We need keys.

353
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:07,704
<i>Go. Go.</i>

354
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:19,009
Jesus.

355
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,902
Where?

356
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,481
Back door key.

357
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:41,706
Door key. Where's that door key?
Door key. Door key.

358
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,675
<i>Back door key.</i>

359
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,333
Where's the fucking key,
the back door key?

360
00:36:57,722 --> 00:36:59,715
Shh. OK.

361
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,391
- Gotta pop the hinges.
- What?

362
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,231
- Screwdriver.
- What?

363
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,233
Seth! Seth, get me a screwdriver.

364
00:37:13,322 --> 00:37:15,563
- Screwdriver?
- Give me a screwdriver!

365
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:21,614
<i>OK. Where would I be
if I were a screwdriver?</i>

366
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:24,371
Where...

367
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,416
<i>OK.</i>

368
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,210
The plan was to get her to Mexico,
get her clean.

369
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:45,173
We both wanted a baby.

370
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,768
We got a name in our minds.

371
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:51,942
It was definitely gonna be a baby girl.

372
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:54,983
We gotta get out of this gas station.

373
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:02,442
- I can't get it.
- Let me get it.

374
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,539
Hurry, baby. Hurry.

375
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:12,670
Are you ready? On three.
One, two, three. Stand back.

376
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,998
<i>- OK. OK.
- Over there.</i>

377
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,168
<i>OK.</i>

378
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:21,677
<i>- OK.
- What?</i>

379
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:25,429
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

380
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:36,527
It's gone.

381
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,530
<i>It's on the roof.</i>

382
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:44,994
We gotta go. Go, go, go, go.

383
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,210
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

384
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:55,380
It's stopped.

385
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:58,333
Let's go.

386
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:01,000
- No, no, no.
- Don't move! Stay there.

387
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:02,259
OK.

388
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,097
<i>- Shit.
- Look, you gotta help us.</i>

389
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:09,139
- There's something out there.
- You're under arrest.

390
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:11,684
Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

391
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:15,141
Look, you're not listening.
There's something out there!

392
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,809
Got every state trooper
looking for you, Farell.

393
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:21,023
None of them would mind
taking you out of here feet first.

394
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:23,820
Ma'am, you really have to
get in your car, OK?

395
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,452
- Go! Go, please!
- Right now.

396
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:29,701
It's OK. I'm here now. You two are safe.
He's not gonna try anything stupid.

397
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:32,661
- It's not safe. Get in your car.
- I'll be alright.

398
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:34,791
Get in your car!

399
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,958
Jesus!

400
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:41,041
- Jesus! What did you do?
- Just get in your car.

401
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:46,427
Listen to me. You're gonna get
in your car right now and call this in.

402
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:49,885
Wake the whole goddamn state
if you have to.

403
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:53,679
Tell them you've got
a hostage situation on your hands.

404
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,016
- I'm calling it in.
- Yeah.

405
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:59,858
But I'm not going anywhere.
5-14, come in.

406
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:03,030
- Please get in your car. Please!
- 5-14, come in.

407
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:06,699
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
We're gonna get you out of there.

408
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:09,159
5-14, come in.

409
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,702
- Boyd!
- It's too late.

410
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:19,045
Boyd! Are you there?

411
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:26,255
Run! Run! Get out of there right now!

412
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:49,447
Get away!

413
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:05,050
It... It took half of her.

414
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:13,175
It killed her. It killed her!

415
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:15,476
- Seth!
- It's OK. It's OK.

416
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:18,184
It killed her. It killed the other girl.

417
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,599
It killed everything.

418
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:24,063
And it's gonna get in here.
It's gonna kill us.

419
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:26,860
- No, it's not.
- It's gonna kill us!

420
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,652
It's gonna kill us.

421
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:38,771
Her car's just right there.
We should make a run for it.

422
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,804
Shit. That thing's way faster
than we are.

423
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,644
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

424
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:46,978
But we got a gun and we got a bat.

425
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:50,358
A gun and a bat ain't gonna do shit.

426
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:53,911
You got a firecracker
on your hands here.

427
00:42:55,163 --> 00:42:57,155
Lacey was like that.

428
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,126
I'm nothing like your white-trash,
drugged-out girlfriend.

429
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:05,461
- Firecracker.
- How is this helping exactly?

430
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:09,083
- Easy, lady. Help can't even help us.
- We have to do something.

431
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:12,795
OK. Let's, er... Let's just start
with what we know, OK?

432
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:16,423
We don't know shit, Seth.
We know it attacks you and you die.

433
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:20,764
No, we know that that thing infected his
girlfriend, so it's a parasite, right?

434
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:24,271
It... It uses its host for mobility.
It consumes you.

435
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,601
- It's... It's like a fungus or a mould.
- OK, so what are you saying?

436
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:34,362
I don't know.

437
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:37,572
So what you're saying is,
it attacks you and you die.

438
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:45,083
She called it in, right?
So someone's gonna come.

439
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,831
She called it in.

440
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:52,425
- Nobody's coming.
- How do you know that?

441
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:55,548
She said they were looking for you.
There's a manhunt on.

442
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:59,175
Not here, there ain't.
Down south there will be.

443
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:02,518
- They think I'm headed to Mexico.
- You are going to Mexico.

444
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,230
<i>Yeah.</i>

445
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:06,936
I'm going north. Platt first.

446
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:14,400
Great.

447
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:17,402
Wonderful.

448
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,998
<i>It's perfect.</i>

449
00:44:30,759 --> 00:44:34,423
- Perfect.
- What? What's perfect?

450
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:38,177
We're in state forest,
a national treasure, right?

451
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,346
<i>Yeah.</i>

452
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:42,554
There's ten feet
between the building and the trees.

453
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:47,023
Oil runs down the steps,
across the dirt, into the trees.

454
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,061
You wanna set the forest on fire?

455
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:57,074
- Light it up and wait for the sirens.
- It won't work. Motor oil won't burn.

456
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,536
But there is lighter fluid
by the barbecue supplies.

457
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:03,949
- You...
- Firecracker.

458
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:08,585
Wait. This is insane. You realise
the fire's gonna come right back at us?

459
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,423
- It won't.
- What?

460
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:13,465
Here.

461
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:17,090
Give me one more. Thanks.

462
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:30,641
Just wait. Just wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What if it's outside the door right now?

463
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:34,021
Can we just stop
and think this through for a second?

464
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,190
This'll work.

465
00:45:38,284 --> 00:45:41,320
Look, any way you slice it,
we're gonna be leaving a trail

466
00:45:41,413 --> 00:45:44,117
of flammable liquid
back into this building.

467
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,577
This is a gas station. We're sitting on
a giant tank of gasoline.

468
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:51,333
I know. But if we get fire trucks
out here, someone'll kill that thing.

469
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:54,672
<i>Being trapped in
a burning building, I don't like that.</i>

470
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,963
Your parasitic mould theory
isn't really working right now.

471
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:01,554
So if you've got another idea,
go ahead.

472
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:07,768
It's working!

473
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:24,659
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

474
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,396
All we have to do is grab it.
Take no more than three seconds.

475
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,065
Yeah, three seconds is all it needs.

476
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,117
OK.

477
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,956
OK.

478
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:24,467
What are you thinking?

479
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:35,527
Here's what we're gonna do.
Tape these together,

480
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,943
snake it outside, hook the receiver,
bring it up, make the call.

481
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,778
No open doors,
no being outside, no fires, OK?

482
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:45,403
OK.

483
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,420
Right there. Hm-hm.

484
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:02,833
OK.

485
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:42,545
<i>I don't think it's long enough.</i>

486
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,489
You OK?

487
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,612
Yeah.

488
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,280
I just cut myself.

489
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:43,396
<i>- Think he's got it.
- There you go.</i>

490
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:45,112
<i>You got it.</i>

491
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:55,532
<i>Fuck.</i>

492
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:00,954
Hm-hm.

493
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:04,338
<i>You got it right there.</i>

494
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:06,668
<i>- OK, you got it.
- Grab it. Hold it.</i>

495
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:12,974
<i>You got it. You got it.</i>

496
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:16,226
<i>There you go, man.
Keep pulling. There you go.</i>

497
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:21,893
Pull it up slowly.

498
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,655
There you go.

499
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:48,047
There you go. Nice and easy.

500
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:56,514
<i>Come on.</i>

501
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,527
<i>- There you go.
- You got it. Be careful.</i>

502
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:12,782
Holy fuck! Holy fuck.

503
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,539
You got it. You got it. Hold onto it.

504
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:25,248
<i>You gotta hold on. Hold on.</i>

505
00:51:41,523 --> 00:51:43,315
<i>Polly!</i>

506
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:46,735
Polly! Stop! Polly!

507
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:49,735
Let's go! Come on!

508
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,199
It's breaking in.
It's breaking in. It's breaking in.

509
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:18,351
It's gone.

510
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,063
It took her legs.

511
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:35,367
- Jesus Christ.
- Why would it do that?

512
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:40,445
Where'd he go?

513
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:51,708
- My God, do you think it got to him?
- I don't see how it would have.

514
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>- Hey.
- Seth, I think he made a run for it.</i>

515
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,590
The front door's still locked.
Maybe he's in back.

516
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:12,320
Seth. Seth.

517
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:17,492
- He's not back there.
- What is it?

518
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:22,405
<i>Don't move.</i>

519
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,036
What is it doing?

520
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,619
Run. Run!

521
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:31,914
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

522
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,762
Seth!

523
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:07,536
Watch the splinters.
Don't let it stick you.

524
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:10,581
<i>- Go, Polly.
- Come on.</i>

525
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:12,998
Go! Go!

526
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:25,469
Fuck off!

527
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:44,076
Move away from the glass.

528
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,074
It'll forget.

529
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:18,525
- How did you know that?
- There's nothing smart about it.

530
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:21,735
- I think he's right.
- Yeah, but it chased us in here.

531
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:27,034
It tracks us somehow,
but it ain't thinking.

532
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:35,748
I think it moves on instinct.
It's like at a cellular level,

533
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,302
it's like a plant root
trying to find water.

534
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:43,173
Yeah, but why can't it track us in here?

535
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,724
I don't know.

536
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:02,070
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

537
00:56:06,914 --> 00:56:08,371
- It's OK.
- Are you OK?

538
00:56:08,456 --> 00:56:12,407
<i>- It's alright.
- What is it? Did it get you?</i>

539
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,878
<i>Goddamn!</i>

540
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:24,762
Alright, don't let it touch you.

541
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:30,347
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch it!

542
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:32,679
- Here, let me just see.
- Don't touch it!

543
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:35,478
- Get away from it!
- Listen...

544
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:41,813
- You gotta...
- Stay away from it!

545
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:52,666
Oh, God!

546
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:54,992
Oh, my God!

547
00:56:56,505 --> 00:57:00,088
- Give me the knife.
- Fuck me.

548
00:57:00,175 --> 00:57:03,378
It's spreading.
I'm gonna have to cut it.

549
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:05,922
Knife.

550
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:09,217
<i>- Get the knife, OK?
- OK.</i>

551
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,219
- Give me the knife!
- OK.

552
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:20,311
- Oh, God.
- OK.

553
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:31,409
- What do we do?
- We have to cut it.

554
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:33,822
- What?
- Get something to hold his arm with.

555
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,407
Grab that thing right there. Get it.

556
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:41,547
Try to cover his arm.
Don't let any of those touch you, OK?

557
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:45,001
<i>OK. OK. OK.</i>

558
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,891
<i>- I'm just gonna tie this off.
- Don't let it touch you.</i>

559
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:56,557
Hurry.

560
00:57:56,648 --> 00:57:58,806
- This is it?
- Yeah.

561
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:02,476
- Hurry!
- OK.

562
00:58:06,532 --> 00:58:09,699
It's OK. It's OK.
We're cutting your arm off.

563
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,541
- OK.
- Cut faster.

564
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:23,081
- Fuck!
- Go!

565
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:28,378
I can't get through the bone
with this knife.

566
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:29,550
What?

567
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,143
What are we gonna do?

568
00:58:35,353 --> 00:58:39,221
Seth? What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

569
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:45,605
<i>- Alright, on three. One.
- Do it.</i>

570
00:58:45,697 --> 00:58:47,985
Two.

571
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,532
Three.

572
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:12,389
It started with that splinter
I got from the flat tyre.

573
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:16,721
What we ran over was just the same
as that thing out there.

574
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:18,887
That's all it took.

575
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:26,317
Looks like I underestimated you.

576
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:30,864
He can't change a tyre,
but fuck if he can't chop off an arm.

577
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:33,489
Yeah, he's a keeper.

578
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:39,583
This one, she locks me out
and leaves me for dead.

579
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:46,081
Hell, I never dreamed this thing
would turn into a ménage ř trois.

580
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:49,293
I'd just as soon die with you two
as anybody else.

581
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,844
I'll drink to that.

582
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:55,505
I wish we'd have made it to Mexico, man.

583
00:59:55,601 --> 01:00:00,427
- I wish we'd never gone camping.
- Shut up. We're not dying in here.

584
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:03,938
This is not over.
We just gotta get him to a hospital.

585
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:07,358
- There's one in Platt, right?
- Don't know. Never been there.

586
01:00:07,445 --> 01:00:11,110
That's just the place
Lacey was stashing my nest egg.

587
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,068
You two never read about me?

588
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:17,027
- You shot a cop?
- No.

589
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,990
They shot me.

590
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,958
I was stealing big rigs.

591
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:32,083
Then this last time, I was working
on a five-day straight mid-high.

592
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:36,804
I asked this guy to give up his keys.
He didn't and I shot him.

593
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,306
Didn't kill him straight away,
just shattered his spine.

594
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:47,644
He died about a year later, and by then,
him and his old lady had gone bankrupt

595
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:52,112
from all the medical bills
and I was sitting in the penitentiary.

596
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,454
I know how it sounds.

597
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:02,998
I just figured if I ever got out,
I'd do two things.

598
01:01:03,085 --> 01:01:06,536
I'd get my ass
across the border with Lacey

599
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,750
and make sure his wife
was taken care of.

600
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,885
You were gonna give your nest egg
to that trucker's wife?

601
01:01:19,268 --> 01:01:21,556
I know it sounds foolish, but...

602
01:01:24,606 --> 01:01:28,224
I figured if I ever got
a second chance, she should too.

603
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:38,692
Isn't he the strangest one-armed convict
you've ever met?

604
01:01:40,956 --> 01:01:45,001
- Baby?
- Temperature.

605
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,047
- I have to check something.
- What?

606
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,927
<i>We gotta chance it.</i>

607
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,603
Seth.

608
01:02:20,661 --> 01:02:23,367
- I don't see it.
- Stay ready.

609
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,824
Maybe it rejoined the big one.

610
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:52,902
<i>Do you see it?</i>

611
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,070
Seth.

612
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:05,746
Do you see it?

613
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:34,603
Now, watch this.
Now, this has been stuck in my head.

614
01:03:34,695 --> 01:03:36,771
<i>Watch out!</i>

615
01:03:37,905 --> 01:03:42,235
Why does it give up on me
and go straight for the car?

616
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:49,123
<i>- Watch out!
- See, it just hits the car.</i>

617
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,708
It doesn't turn after me.
I don't think it was ever going for me.

618
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:57,375
It was going for the car cos the car
was hotter. I think it tracks with heat.

619
01:03:59,677 --> 01:04:02,596
It's a simple organism
and it's just looking for food.

620
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:04,887
It goes for the warmest thing
and kills it.

621
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,309
The engine was overheated, right?
So it was way hotter than me.

622
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:10,684
It can't track us in the refrigerator.

623
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:14,306
Exactly. It's too cold.
We're invisible to it.

624
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:22,648
All I have to do is walk to the
sheriff's car and bring it to the door.

625
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:27,487
No. That thing would be on you
in three seconds. You said so yourself.

626
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:31,280
Yeah, but not if my temperature
was below the ambient temperature.

627
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:33,831
The human body can drop
to 32 degrees Celsius

628
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,914
before medical emergency occurs,
so that's 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

629
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:41,048
Thank God for global warming in July.

630
01:04:41,135 --> 01:04:44,422
All we have to do is keep
my body temperature below 93 degrees.

631
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,219
I'll be like a fucking ghost
to that thing.

632
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:55,474
What about the medical emergency?

633
01:05:06,954 --> 01:05:08,862
<i>95.</i>

634
01:05:22,427 --> 01:05:24,715
Seth, you're gonna kill yourself.

635
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:28,090
Not if you keep me above 89.6.

636
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:30,804
Here, gotta get this hand cold.

637
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:41,601
You don't have to prove anything to me.

638
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:45,777
I know.

639
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:49,652
But if we don't get out of here,
I'm never gonna...

640
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:52,284
We'll never get to show that tent
who's boss.

641
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:03,041
Try it again.

642
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,427
94.

643
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:31,992
You don't wanna do too much of that.
You're gonna warm up my lips.

644
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:35,949
Shut up.

645
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,663
You're gonna be OK.

646
01:06:41,757 --> 01:06:44,461
<i>Just a couple more degrees.</i>

647
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,463
Almost ready.

648
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:59,096
We're gonna use these fireworks
to keep that thing off you, OK?

649
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,681
- Got enough?
- Yeah.

650
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:08,443
Hey, make sure she's ready
when I bring the car around, OK?

651
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:10,905
She usually takes forever with that.

652
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:14,327
No, no, no, don't touch me.
You're gonna warm me up.

653
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,708
Come back.

654
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,911
You know I will.

655
01:07:24,632 --> 01:07:26,590
I love you.

656
01:07:26,677 --> 01:07:28,753
I love you, too.

657
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:32,224
Next year's gonna be better, I promise.

658
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:37,094
Next year Hawaii.

659
01:08:08,635 --> 01:08:11,422
Alright, go! Go! Go!

660
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:51,752
Damn it.

661
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:16,481
Come on, buddy. You gotta go faster.

662
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:33,172
He's gonna need more time.

663
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:43,725
- He's almost there.
- There you go.

664
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,608
Hey, fireworks.

665
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:07,993
I don't see it!

666
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:37,360
Where'd it go?

667
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,155
Hello.

668
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:46,990
Hello.

669
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:07,761
<i>Polly! I don't see it.</i>

670
01:11:07,855 --> 01:11:09,398
Oh, God. Oh, God.

671
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:13,810
- Seth!
- Polly!

672
01:11:17,157 --> 01:11:18,319
Seth!

673
01:12:09,126 --> 01:12:11,202
<i>Dennis!</i>

674
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,667
Come on! Get up! Get up!

675
01:12:39,448 --> 01:12:41,939
Polly? Come on.

676
01:13:01,802 --> 01:13:05,219
Where'd it go? Do you see it?

677
01:13:05,306 --> 01:13:06,551
No.

678
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,469
Hold it.

679
01:14:01,488 --> 01:14:03,610
What? Hey!

680
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:13,703
Hey!

681
01:14:22,259 --> 01:14:23,301
Shit!

682
01:14:29,182 --> 01:14:31,507
Seth! Seth!

683
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:39,971
The fire.

684
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:42,226
We gotta get it in the fire!

685
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,313
Fuck. Polly!

686
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:49,484
Polly!

687
01:14:57,211 --> 01:14:59,250
Here!

688
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,586
- Are you sure?
- Here!

689
01:15:05,636 --> 01:15:08,042
Go.

690
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:10,213
Go!

691
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:21,899
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Keep going.

692
01:15:28,074 --> 01:15:30,317
Keep running.

693
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,055
<i>Fuck it.</i>

694
01:16:37,269 --> 01:16:39,557
Dennis.

695
01:16:39,645 --> 01:16:41,721
Go. Go.

696
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,564
Let me see him.

697
01:16:50,364 --> 01:16:53,069
- Oh, no.
- What you gonna cut off now, Doc?

698
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:04,293
Here. Take this.

699
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:07,296
Take it to the bank in Platt.

700
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:11,716
Give it all to her.

701
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:19,765
<i>- Now, you two, make it count.
- OK.</i>

702
01:17:32,365 --> 01:17:35,117
<i>Now, get the fuck out of here.</i>

703
01:17:35,202 --> 01:17:37,278
Come on.

704
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:40,952
<i>- Let's go.
- Go on.</i>

705
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:43,958
<i>- Get out of here.
- Come on, Polly.</i>

706
01:17:44,545 --> 01:17:46,832
Polly, come on.

707
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:00,088
I love you.

708
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:02,550
Fuck it.

709
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,525
Fuck it.

710
01:18:16,784 --> 01:18:19,952
Here I come, baby.

711
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:41,097
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

712
01:18:41,185 --> 01:18:43,854
Now, we're gonna get you warmed up.

713
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:47,056
<i>Just tell me
if you see any fire trucks.</i>

714
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:51,774
<i>Yeah, OK.
Well, I see a post oak.</i>

715
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:54,898
<i>- It's gotta be 300 years old.
- It's not a post oak.</i>

716
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:57,528
<i>- No?
- It's just a tree. Keep walking.</i>

717
01:18:57,618 --> 01:18:59,490
<i>OK.</i>
