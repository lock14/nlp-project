1
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,876
One, two, three, four, five, six

2
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,533
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve

3
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,101
Okay.

4
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,824
Auditions for Miss Jackson
step rehearsals.

5
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:47,632
Step rehearsals will meet
in room 326 after school today.

6
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,155
Aww.

7
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,855
What is history?

8
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,163
Opposites.

9
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,598
You can read the board.

10
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,601
I'm so happy to hear that.

11
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,601
No, what is it?

12
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,670
What does it mean? Stace?

13
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,605
Change?

14
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,867
Thank you, Stacey.

15
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,395
I'm glad to hear
someone's paying attention.

16
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,613
History is the study
Of change over time.

17
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,875
And what's change?

18
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,617
It's this. It's opposites.

19
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,882
It's two things that push against
each other in opposite directions.

20
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,884
So the civil rights movement,
okay, it's essentially,

21
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,626
It's two opposing mentalities.

22
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,663
In the south, the majority believes

23
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,891
All men are not created equal,
and there's a minority

24
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,894
Who believes that they are,
so that minority struggles

25
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,637
and it fights and it pushes
till eventually

26
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,900
It becomes the majority.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
Am I boring you? Huh?

28
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,647
Let's give you some examples,
okay, of opposing forces,

29
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,910
Like I'm going to go night and day.

30
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,650
What else?

31
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,651
Big and little.

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,654
Good. Anything else?

33
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,654
Left and right.

34
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,657
You and I.

35
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,660
You and I.

36
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,008
Teacher, student. Anything else?

37
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,924
Yeah.

38
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,926
Just wondering if you could count me and
Gina's bald-headed sister as opposites.

39
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,668
Oh, insult.

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,934
Gina come on, tell me you're not
going to take that?

41
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,677
You got a bald sister?
Is your sister bald?

42
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,712
Give me something.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,940
May 17, 1954.

44
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,683
Oh.

45
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,156
And I expect some thought from you.

46
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,692
I don't want just dates and facts.

47
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,694
I want to know why.
I want to know consequences.

48
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,697
I want to know what it means. All right.

49
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,699
Now, back to the bald sister.

50
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,701
What's going on with that?

51
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,964
Right.

52
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,705
Left. Back.

53
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,711
I'm shooting.

54
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,713
You got your girl open over here.

55
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,421
She's sending out smoke signals
over here.

56
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,717
She's got the fire.

57
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,984
She's going I got it over here
and you're like-

58
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,760
Come on, get open. Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,989
Drey?

60
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,731
You going to put that down
and come play or what?

61
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,997
I ain't done yet, Coach.

62
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,844
All right, top of the key,
three passes, here we go.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,763
Thursday, 11:16 a. m.

64
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,026
Hello, this is Taylor calling
from Consolidated Credit.

65
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,766
This is an urgent message
For Mr. Daniel Dunn

66
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,235
Regarding your outstanding balance.

67
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,774
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

68
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:14,779
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.
I'm in town for a while.

69
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:20,046
You know, my Mom, anyway,
I know it's been forever,

70
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,788
But I'd really like to see you.

71
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,790
I don't know.

72
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,053
I'll be at my parents
so give me a call, okay?

73
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,055
Bye.

74
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,061
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

75
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,062
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.

76
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,871
I like Oprah.

77
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,135
I love Oprah.

78
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,584
But the thing is I was just fucking
things up just to fuck them up.

79
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,880
Right, right. No.

80
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:56,878
Right.

81
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,142
Yeah.

82
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,887
Right, because everything that is worth-

83
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,887
Right, just forget it.
So you're a teacher?

84
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,942
I'm a teacher.

85
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,286
And what am I supposed To teach
them, you know what I mean?

86
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,903
Right.

87
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,903
That's the point, you know what I mean?

88
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,904
Yeah.

89
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,906
Yeah.

90
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,170
If you can change one person-

91
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,172
Then you can change them all.

92
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,911
I want to dance.

93
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,915
I want to dance.

94
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:40,221
Let's dance.

95
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:02,981
What's going on, bro?

96
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,210
What's the word?

97
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,952
What's that?

98
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,954
What, this right here? Mm-hmm.

99
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,217
Some new street shit.

100
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:21,025
Go ahead, man, check it out.

101
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,970
You got to feel that shit.

102
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,229
Yeah, it's not bad.

103
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,238
That's the street shit.

104
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,979
So what you need, teach, another eighth?

105
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,242
I only got 30.

106
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,244
Word.

107
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,986
It's been a long week.

108
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:48,254
You want that other thing?

109
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,997
On may 17, 1954, The supreme court ruled

110
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,260
On the case of Brown
versus Board of Education,

111
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,003
Making it illegal for states
to segregate public schools.

112
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,865
This was a major step forward
in the struggle

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
For racial justice and helped begin

114
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,010
A flurry of bold and heroic actions

115
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:14,078
Known as the Civil Rights Movement.

116
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,034
Get on her. Sally, get on her.

117
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:38,102
It's all right, Sally. Come on.

118
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,333
Come on.

119
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Ballgame, ladies. Ballgame.

120
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:41,165
Okay. Good job.

121
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,372
I like our chances Against Saint Joseph.

122
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,111
The thing is if we could just
Figure out a way to put the ball

123
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,375
In the hoop it would be fine.

124
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,118
Stace, good job tonight.

125
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,380
Thank you.

126
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,188
You did a great job.
Is there anyone else in there?

127
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,124
No, that's it.

128
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,124
Thanks for tonight.

129
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:06,995
All right. Bye, Mr. Dunn.

130
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,403
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,148
I heard this was the place.

132
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,152
We need a little work,
But we're having fun so, yeah.

133
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,159
How are you?

134
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,423
Same old, same old.

135
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,164
I'm happy to see you.

136
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:45,431
It's good to see you too. You look good.

137
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,173
Come on, I got fat.

138
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:57,241
Oh, I know, but it looks great.
You look healthy.

139
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,445
Do you want to go get some-

140
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,448
I can't. I got to-

141
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,450
To get some coffee?

142
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,452
Yeah.

143
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,457
I can't tonight.

144
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,459
Do you want to do it Another night?

145
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:15,767
Okay.

146
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:33,277
Hey, how's your Mom?

147
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:44,322
Did you get my messages?

148
00:12:54,306 --> 00:13:02,306
Hello? I'm coming in.

149
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:04,816
Anyone?

150
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:04,428
Somebody in there?

151
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,386
Oh, sorry.

152
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,270
That's okay.

153
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:36,401
It's okay. I'm fine.

154
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:41,667
I'm sorry.

155
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,672
Are you okay?

156
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:55,479
Can you help me up?

157
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,699
Are you okay?

158
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,440
Yeah.

159
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:21,445
Okay, good.

160
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:29,513
It's gonna be fine.

161
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,270
Some water?

162
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:47,531
I'm sorry, but I'm fine.

163
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,758
Just don't go, okay, Just for a minute?

164
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,762
Just for a minute?

165
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:47,591
See you tomorrow?

166
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:43,708
Hey, kiddo.

167
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,970
How's Darrel's leg healing?

168
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:47,972
I don't know.

169
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,975
You didn't go to the hospital?

170
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,980
No.

171
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,721
Did your father pick you up
from practice last night, Drey?

172
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,724
No.

173
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,987
Fucking shit. How did you get home?

174
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,731
Coach.

175
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,734
I'm tired of this.
Something has got to change.

176
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,996
I don't know what.

177
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:17,002
You don't got to worry about me.

178
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,003
Oh, look at you, Miss 12.

179
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,005
Thirteen, I'm 13 now.

180
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,748
Oh, so you grown, huh?

181
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,750
Going to take care of yourself,
Is that it?

182
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,013
Pretty much.

183
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,810
Well, that's a relief.

184
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:38,889
I guess I ain't got to cook up
these burgers then, huh?

185
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,072
Hey, Mom, you know this dude
Cesar Chavez on Spanish Six?

186
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,028
Cesar who?

187
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,772
Cesar Chavez.
He once fasted for 35 days.

188
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,775
That means he didn't eat For 35 days,

189
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,038
Mm-hmm.

190
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,806
Think you could do that?

191
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,054
Hi, honey, it's Mom.

192
00:22:53,939 --> 00:23:01,846
Hello? Hi, um, is Rachel there?

193
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,869
Well, I feel good today.

194
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,134
Anyone else feel good? Hmm?

195
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:35,140
I need a volunteer, and I need
somebody who feels strong.

196
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,882
So what we've got here
Is two opposing forces,

197
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,885
Terrence and myself, and we're
pushing against each other.

198
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,228
And as long as one is stronger-
and it looks like it's t-

199
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,892
The change is slow and consistent.

200
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,690
But once the other side
becomes stronger,

201
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,162
There's a turning point.

202
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,164
Thank you, T. Make sense?

203
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,166
Okay.

204
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,909
Now, turning points
can happen like that.

205
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:12,976
They can be physical, or they
can happen on a greater scale,

206
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,181
Like a war or something.

207
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,186
So why don't you do me a favor and write

208
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,927
Three examples
Of historical turning points

209
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:31,995
That we've talked about in class, okay?

210
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,199
What's up?

211
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:44,007
Have you even opened the
Civil Rights binder I gave you?

212
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:54,948
The Civil Rights binder I have opened,

213
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,961
and it's got some great stuff in it.

214
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,964
I think it's great. Yeah.

215
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,752
I'm just providing
a little general content-

216
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:07,232
I need you on the civil rights
Section by next week.

217
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:08,971
Nice seeing you.

218
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Is that gum in your mouth?

219
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,257
He was a Gemini. He was so cocky.

220
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,999
Every day I saw him he used to
go like, oh, you happy you got me.

221
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,507
You happy you got me, and I be like,

222
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,270
Please you the one that's got
me, so y'all like Geminis?

223
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,006
Oh, what's his name?

224
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,269
Mr. Easton and Mrs. Wright
In the movie theater.

225
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,517
I'm pretty sure they're married. No.

226
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,273
I don't, they can't.

227
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,013
You don't know what you're
talking about, so don't talk.

228
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,014
No, but they look weird together.

229
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,397
Y'all think Mr. Dunn is married?

230
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,020
Would you want to marry him?

231
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,020
Come in the room,
swirling his finger around,

232
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,021
Telling us to move the desk.

233
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,024
Why can't he move the desk?

234
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,026
I'm getting tired of that every morning.

235
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,334
Don't forget about his glasses.

236
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,290
And he... bifocals.

237
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,295
He start Throwing them
around, throwing the chalk.

238
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,069
Like he all cool and fly
and everything, but-

239
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:12,716
Ridley?

240
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:13,295
Quiet.

241
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,041
Would you marry your father? Oh.

242
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,043
"A man who was curious to know
If a knife could penetrate

243
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,751
"his bulletproof vest
Was killed yesterday

244
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,045
"by a stab wound to the chest.

245
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,309
"Witnesses say the man, Jeff Turner, 32,

246
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:32,056
"urged his brother,
Scott Turner, 35, to stab him

247
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,321
"as hard as he could, believing
The vest would stop the knife.

248
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:37,876
It didn't."

249
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,332
So how's Your opposite somethings?

250
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,074
Pretty good.

251
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,337
Where'd you come up with that stuff?

252
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,339
It's just a little something
I picked up in college.

253
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,748
A little thick for the eighth grade, no?

254
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,029
Yeah, yeah, well, you'd think,
but I don't know.

255
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,348
I think they're getting it.

256
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,092
You know, Drey is so textbook.

257
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,355
How's your book?

258
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,358
Don't ask.

259
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,100
There's always the summer.

260
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,100
Do you want to go?

261
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,693
You want to have dinner with me again?

262
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,372
Okay. Mm-hmm?

263
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,113
Did you guys hear that they found

264
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,461
A crack vial in the locker room?

265
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,378
Jesus.

266
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,380
Hmm.

267
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,124
Whose it is? Oh, I don't know.

268
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,387
Hey, you know what? That's a good idea.

269
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,389
We can put it in the lost and
found to see if anybody claims it.

270
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:54,197
Better yet, why don't we put up
flyers with a picture?

271
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,149
What's new?

272
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,413
I don't know.

273
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:16,160
I can't hear you. Come over here.

274
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,195
That's a nice cap.

275
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,423
Thanks. It's Mike's.

276
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:25,168
Yeah, I know. Talk to him lately?

277
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,431
He writes sometimes.

278
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,173
How's he doing in there?

279
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,175
All right, I guess.

280
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,177
Well, if he needs something,
Let me know, all right?

281
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,485
I mean, I know people in there.

282
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,183
Okay.

283
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,185
Okay?

284
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,185
Yeah.

285
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:51,254
All right then.

286
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:57,200
What, you thirsty, huh?
You want something to drink?

287
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,462
My bike.

288
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:07,270
Ain't nobody going
to fuck with that bike.

289
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,215
Yo Harvey, this is Drey. Hey, Tina?

290
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,124
You remember Mike's
little sister, Drey, right?

291
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,252
Oh, hey, sweetie.

292
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,483
Come and sit down.
Let me get that juice for you.

293
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,485
Help yourself. Come on and sit.

294
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:30,293
I'll be right back.

295
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,535
Yo, pick a hand.

296
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:17,280
Ha, you lose.

297
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,282
Come on. What's up with that juice?

298
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,545
I'm not thirsty.

299
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,287
Well, don't be a stranger, kid.

300
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,835
You could stop through and say hello.

301
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:26,857
Yeah.

302
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,567
You saw Frank today?

303
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:52,375
Just ran into him.

304
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,601
On September 13, 1971,
1200 Attica state prison inmates

305
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,209
Seized control of the prison
and took hostages

306
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,608
To negotiate changes
to their inhumane conditions.

307
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,610
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
ordered a military assault

308
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,354
On the prison which killed
29 inmates and 10 hostages,

309
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,617
Every one caused from police gunshots.

310
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,360
An official commission later
Stated, with the exception

311
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,623
Of indian massacres
In the late 19th century,

312
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,366
The police assault was
the bloodiest one-day encounter

313
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,369
Between Americans Since the civil war.

314
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:42,425
Unbelievable. What are you doing?

315
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:50,423
Go sit in the desk. Ten points off.

316
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,436
Second chances are rare, man.

317
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,440
You ought to take
better advantage of them.

318
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,706
Don't let go.
Grab the t-shirt if you need to.

319
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,448
You know, a little elbow here
and there never killed anybody,

320
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,709
You know what I mean?

321
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,715
As long as the ref isn't looking.

322
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,490
Not in my house.

323
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,919
It's a nice surprise. Where's Mom?

324
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,754
Working.

325
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,757
Darrel's uncle came to visit
so I came along with him.

326
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,759
How's Darrel's leg?

327
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,762
It's all right.

328
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,767
It's nice to see you.

329
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,771
Those for me?

330
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,510
Frank's for sending me
some of them nasty peppermints

331
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,511
He always eating.

332
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,774
What is that?

333
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:17,521
I threw them shits out.

334
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,555
So how's the team?

335
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,784
We suck.

336
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,527
And Ma, still working too hard?

337
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,789
Yeah.

338
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,532
But she all right for money though.

339
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,535
Frank still looking out?

340
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,799
Good.

341
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:41,806
He owes us.

342
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,808
So how come you never told on him?

343
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,552
For what?

344
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,060
Would've made shit more complicated.

345
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:57,822
And shit was already fucked up
as it is, you know?

346
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,824
That's all in the past, though.

347
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,829
I'm going to get out of here.
You'll see.

348
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,571
I mean, you got Russell Simmons
On the case.

349
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,839
Russell Simmons?

350
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,583
Look, we'll be all right.

351
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,299
I have to write
an essay about growing up.

352
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,856
I'm going to fail the course.

353
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,859
Well, that's your problem, Charles.

354
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,599
My problem is making sure
that you keep an eye on things

355
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,862
While I'm gone.

356
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,865
Actually that's also your problem.

357
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,605
You've got a lot Of problems, Charles.

358
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:49,874
Don't let them get
in the way of your work.

359
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,616
There's a time when
the operation of the machine

360
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,653
Becomes so odious,
makes you so sick at heart

361
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,881
That you can't take part.

362
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,624
You can't even passively
take part, and you've got

363
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,887
To put your bodies upon
the gears and upon the wheels,

364
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,890
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus

365
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,633
and you've got to make it stop,
and you've got to indicate

366
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,661
to the people who run it,
to the people who own it

367
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,897
that unless you're free,
the machine will be prevented

368
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,640
from working at all.

369
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,303
What is this machine
that he's talking about?

370
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,567
It's keeping us down. What is it?

371
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,649
Like robots and stuff, right?

372
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,912
It could be robots.

373
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,655
It could be robots,
but let's say it's a metaphor.

374
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,443
He's saying this machine
is keeping me down.

375
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,920
Now, what is that?
What keeps us from being free?

376
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,662
Ms. Drey?

377
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,925
Prisons.

378
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,669
Absolutely, absolutely. Prisons, okay?

379
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,177
Prisons are definitely a part of it.

380
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,674
White.

381
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,677
The man.

382
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,713
The school, exactly.

383
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,940
The whole education system
is part of the machine.

384
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,943
What else?

385
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,945
Aren't you the machine then?

386
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,120
Oh, no, you didn't. What'd you say?

387
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,949
Aren't you the machine?

388
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,957
You're saying I'm the machine?

389
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,954
Yeah, you're white.
You're part of the school.

390
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,123
Oh, yeah, I guess you got a point.

391
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,284
All right, so I'm part of the machine,

392
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,700
But if I'm part of it so are you.

393
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,702
You are, too. We all are.

394
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,966
Everything is made with opposing force.

395
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,708
We may be opposed to the machine,

396
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,971
But we're still very much
a part of it, right?

397
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,714
I work for the government,
the school, but I'm also

398
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,462
very much opposed
to a lot of its policies.

399
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,719
Yes.

400
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,727
Sometimes, exactly.

401
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,734
Where you headed?

402
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,397
You look like you're in a rush. Hungry?

403
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,739
I'm starving.

404
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,742
Come on. Burger's on me.

405
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,004
So how's school?

406
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,746
It's hard.

407
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,747
I got a game tomorrow.

408
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,316
Word.

409
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,015
Want to come?

410
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,756
Working.

411
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,020
Pops?

412
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,760
Fuck it. I'll come through.

413
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:25,029
Somebody got to represent.

414
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:30,773
Tina packed some sweets
For Mike last night.

415
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:35,039
Your brother was a good friend,
still is.

416
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,041
That dude was funny.

417
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,783
I mean, he ever showed you
the chicken walk?

418
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,045
The what?

419
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,791
I mean, I can't do it, But it's like-

420
00:38:53,864 --> 00:39:01,794
- shit was bananas.

421
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:06,070
You know, we used
to work together, right?

422
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:14,877
You ever think about working?

423
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,080
Shit. I used to work here.

424
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,083
For real?

425
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:25,828
$150 a week. Hey, Keesha?

426
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:26,828
What's up, hon?

427
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,161
We need two milkshakes, baby.

428
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,857
I know I don't sound sincere,
but I mean it.

429
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,856
Thank you.

430
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,859
I think I-

431
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,123
Why can't I say that sincerely?

432
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,126
Oh, you can. I went back to school.

433
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,128
Mm-hmm.

434
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,925
Environmental Policy.

435
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,868
No, I know, but I think
you're really going to be great.

436
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,873
I believed you the first time.

437
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,877
I'm just nervous that's all.

438
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,139
How are you?

439
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,882
I don't know.

440
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,148
You still rocking out?

441
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:31,884
When the occasion calls.

442
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:32,462
Yeah.

443
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,911
Who's the lucky guy?

444
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:55,179
I met him in the program.

445
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:59,183
I don't know, Dan.

446
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,924
Some people change.
Some people actually change.

447
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,927
I know.

448
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,191
No way. I'm still an asshole.

449
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:14,198
You're not an asshole.
You're just a big baby.

450
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:21,205
I'm a big asshole baby.

451
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,963
Let's go, rebels.

452
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,967
Pass it in.

453
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,969
All right, there you go.

454
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,231
Blue ball.

455
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,319
What is that? You're killing us.

456
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:51,973
You need to watch yourself.
Another bad call, hear?

457
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,236
Blue ball.

458
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,978
Walk it off, baby, Walk it
off. Come on, shake it off.

459
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,983
Hustle back.

460
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:09,051
That was a bad call, man.

461
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,997
You okay?

462
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:15,565
Yeah.

463
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,271
You want a ride home tonight
after the game?

464
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:28,758
All right.

465
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,288
Foul, foul, call the foul.

466
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,255
Coach, go back to your bench.

467
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,029
Go back to your bench.

468
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,030
All the foul. All it.

469
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,032
All the foul.

470
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,702
This is fucking bullshit
and you know it.

471
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,035
You're gone, coach.

472
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,299
I won't tolerate that language
on my court.

473
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,039
Oh, it's the language
you don't tolerate,

474
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,040
Fucking language, excuse me.

475
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:06,049
I didn't know it was the language.

476
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:14,116
All right. Good luck, girls.

477
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,324
I think your hand is changing
colors get more ice on it.

478
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,066
You should've seen the wall.

479
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,328
I'm telling you, Dunn, you
should've knocked that nigga out.

480
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,333
You can't go around
knocking people out, you know,

481
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,075
Or throwing balls at them
just because you're upset.

482
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,075
It would've felt good, though, right,

483
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,339
Felt good to just get it out.

484
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,627
There's other ways of getting it out.

485
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:44,348
Right. Like you do?

486
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:50,092
Look, just because you know
that one thing about me,

487
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:58,160
One thing doesn't make a man.

488
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,106
What?

489
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:08,372
One thing doesn't make a man?

490
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,139
You know I was just talking
about your hand right?

491
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,115
Yeah.

492
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:20,112
Yeah, I knew that.

493
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,127
Hey, who was that guy
that was cheering for you?

494
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,389
Do you know him?

495
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:31,395
Not really. Do you?

496
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:32,702
No.

497
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,139
So we can just keep the whole
punching the wall thing

498
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,402
A secret, right?

499
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:48,210
You don't have to tell anybody, right?

500
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:15,237
What's up, Santa Claus? Where you going?

501
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:57,279
I had a good day.

502
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,222
Even after the dolphin report, right?

503
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,485
Even after it says there are no weapons.

504
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,228
There are no WMD programs.
There is nothing.

505
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,228
They do that, The Pippa study,

506
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,658
That University Of Maryland thing,

507
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,494
and turns out 72 percent
Of his supporters

508
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,499
Still believe there's WMDs.

509
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,242
Seventy-five percent
still believe they're supporting

510
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,508
Al Qaeda and so what
the fuck do we do you know?

511
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,509
What do you do?

512
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,252
What does one, I'm one man,
what I do, you know?

513
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,515
I used to be so fucked up.

514
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,257
I used to be so fucked up
I was just out there, you know,

515
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,260
But I fucking cleaned up.

516
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,212
I cleaned up-

517
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,269
For the most part.

518
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,272
I do it now to get by,
but I can handle it.

519
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,275
You know what I mean?

520
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,277
I tried the rehab thing. I tried it.

521
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,280
It didn't work. It didn't work.

522
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:02,546
You know, it works for some people.

523
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:11,353
My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

524
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,560
So it works for some people, right?

525
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,302
It didn't work for me.

526
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:27,572
The kids keep me focused, and I-

527
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:20,056
Number three: Change moves
in spirals, not circles.

528
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:27,368
For example, the sun goes up
and then it comes down,

529
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:32,374
But every time that happens
what do you get?

530
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:40,442
You get a new day. You get a new one.

531
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:47,651
When you breathe, you inhale
and then you exhale,

532
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:52,394
But every single time that you do that

533
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:57,399
You're a little bit different
than the one before.

534
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:02,404
We're always changing,
and it's important to know

535
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,667
That there are some changes
you can't control

536
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,410
But that there are others you can.

537
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,420

00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,436
Hi.

542
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,699
How come you're not eating
with the teachers?

543
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,442
Just...

544
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,446
I felt like being alone.

545
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,708
I know what you mean.

546
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,451
You do?

547
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,019
Mm-hmm.

548
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,495
All right, Mr. Dunn, I'll see you later.

Oh, yeah, do you think
I could get a ride home later?

552
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,040
Okay?

553
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,484
Okay.

554
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,758

555
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,502
Thanks for the ride.

556
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,764
Okay. Have a good weekend.

557
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,073
Bye.

558
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,096
Yo.

559
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,795
I lost my key.

560
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,538
What do we do?

561
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,574
I don't know.

562
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,803
She's an E.M.T.

563
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:26,548
I could page her, but I don't know.

564
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,811
All right, get in.

565
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:44,556
What's up, y'all? You want some candy?

566
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,566
That's all you got?

567
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,832
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
So where your bike at?

568
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,833
They stole it.

569
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,835
They who?

570
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,579
I don't know.
I'm going to find out though.

571
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,842
So what, man. Y'all just chilling?

572
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,849
She lost my key-her key.

573
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,590
So what, Drey, what?

574
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,593
No, man, we're cool.

575
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,593
Are you cool, Drey?

576
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,162
Mm-hmm.

577
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,601
All right.

578
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,874
What, you don't know him, huh?

579
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,873
Who, Frank?

580
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,875
Frank?

581
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,617
I thought you said you didn't know him.

582
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,006
Just a guy from the neighborhood.

583
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:42,624
You know what he does?

584
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,889
Look, I know that I'm the last person

585
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:51,895
That should be saying this.

586
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:59,904
You don't have to worry about me.

587
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:08,710
Okay, let me-Just give me a sec.

588
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,220
Wait.

589
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,230
Okay.

590
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,674
Have a seat.

591
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,941
You can watch tv if you want.

592
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:44,948
Make yourself at home.

593
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,691
You got them old things?

594
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,693
Records?

595
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:52,955
Yeah.

596
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:57,699
Yeah, little Miss mp3, I got records.

597
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:05,767
You should check them out.
You might learn something.

598
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,752
Who's this?

599
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,980
My parents and my brother.

600
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,722
Do they still live together?

601
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,290
Yeah.

602
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,730
Why you got so many books
about black people?

603
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,993
I got books about all kinds of people.

604
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:38,001
Can I borrow one?

605
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,743
Yeah.

606
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,748
Who's she?

607
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,010
Just an old friend.

608
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,753
What happened to her?

609
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,756
Oh, well, you should mind your business.

610
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:59,022
You put it up there.

611
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,763
I've seen her before.

612
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:07,030
She was at the game that night, right?

613
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,337
Yeah.

614
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:20,043
You need help in here?

615
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,784
Do you like to cook?

616
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:29,052
Yeah, sometimes, mostly just
for special occasions.

617
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,054
You got a lady
coming over tonight or what?

618
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,796
Yeah.

619
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,058
You must like her a lot.

620
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,060
Yeah, she's all right.

621
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,802
She like you?

622
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,065
I don't know.
I'm hard to like sometimes.

623
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,805
That's true.

624
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,374
Oh.

625
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,639
Oh, yeah, you just got to,
you mash those up.

626
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:52,813
You mash them up with your hands.

627
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,077
Get in there and squeeze them.

628
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,820
See, what you need is some
jokes. Women love jokes.

629
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,085
Okay. You got any?

630
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,493
What do you call cheese
that's not yours?

631
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:09,829
Nacho cheese.

632
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,095
Absolutely not.

633
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:21,903
That's a funny joke. Thank you.

634
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,845
Yeah.

635
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:25,874
Can I ask you something?

636
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:26,415
Mm-hmm.

637
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:43,925
What's it like
when you smoke that stuff?

638
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,868
Sorry.

639
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:54,970
No, don't be. It's all right.

640
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:16,159
Mash them up.

641
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:23,895
Hope you have a nice date, Mr. Dunn.

642
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:30,902
Hey, thanks for the joke.

643
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,175
So my buddy gets in the car
and the cab driver's like,

644
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,177
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

645
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,920
I had to kill somebody
On the way here, you know.

646
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:39,955
And he's like, what?

647
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,186
He's like, oh, yeah
I kill him, I kill him.

648
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,928
And he's like, what do you,
You, you killed him?

649
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,192
I'm killing people, you know, anybody

650
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,194
Who really kind of mouth off
to me, I fucking kill them, man.

651
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:56,199
Turns out he thinks "kill" is
the word for "punch," right?

652
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,943
My friend thinks that he's killing them.

653
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,692
He's terrified and he thinks that
the word for "cement" is "semen."

654
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,135
So he's like well, basically

655
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,210
stepping on semen.

656
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,213
There's semen everywhere.
There's semen buildings.

657
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,218
It's lot of people, you know, so
everything is made of semen, you know.

658
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:23,227
I didn't say every day.
You're her father.

659
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,433
Today she got locked out the house.

660
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:20,343
Are you a communist?

661
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:21,650
What?

662
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,091
"Ohe in Africa"?

663
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,093
So?

664
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:40,161
"The Communist Manifesto?"

665
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:46,107
If I had a copy of "Mein Kampf"
Would that make me a Nazi?

666
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:51,374
You know, this is really good,
very tasty.

667
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:59,383
You should try it warm.

668
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,178
Well, you don't have
a copy of of "Mein Kampf"

669
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,386
But if you did, then yes,
I'd ask you if you were a Nazi.

670
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,389
Maybe I'm hiding it.

671
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,132
Why would you hide it?

672
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:19,200
'Cause it's just not cool
To be a Nazi anymore, baby.

673
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,411
So what are you doing today?

674
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:34,155
Oh, I got to-

675
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,417
It's great you're writing.

676
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:42,164
Yeah, we'll see.

677
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,511
I should let you get to it then.

678
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,794
Yeah, thanks though. I had a good time.

679
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,119
Yeah, me too.

680
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,445
On November 1, 1977,
Harvey Milk was elected

681
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,186
To the San Francisco City Council.

682
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,615
He was the first Openly gay person

683
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,451
To ever be elected To public office.

684
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,219
A year later he was
assassinated by another member

685
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,456
Of the City Council Called Dan White.

686
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,264
Reports that Harvey Milk
have been shot and killed.

687
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,200
Dan White claimed he shot Milk
because he ate

688
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,463
too much junk food that day.

689
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,468
This would later be known
As the twinkie defense.

690
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,209
Is that for real?

691
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,561
Drey, Drey, come here.
Where are you going?

692
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,562
Home.

693
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,304
I'll give you a ride home.

694
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,566
That's cool. I got a ride.

695
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,308
I don't really think you should
be riding with him, do you think?

696
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,311
Drey, is everything cool?

697
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,311
Everything's okay.
I'm going to take her home.

698
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,312
Is that right?

699
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,315
Yeah.

700
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,317
Is that right, D, huh,
you getting a ride with teach?

701
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,352
No, man.

702
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,583
Drey, Drey, Drey, come here.
Everything's fine.

703
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,324
Have a nice night.

704
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,326
I'm going to take her home, Okay?

705
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,588
Hey, look, man, you know what,
let me introduce myself, huh?

706
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,591
I'm Frank.

707
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,333
Come here now, okay?

708
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,595
Come here. Come here.

709
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,339
Come on.

710
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,340
Did I hurt you?

711
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,607
We'll see you later, Teach. Come on.

712
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:04,627
Dunn, right? Lloyd Dixon.

713
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,629
My daughter Paula went
To Jefferson, Paula Dixon.

714
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,632
You taught history, right?

715
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,635
Paula Dixon?

716
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,378
She's in her first semester
At Georgetown, history major.

717
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,262
Paula Dixon.

718
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:29,652
You have a good night.

719
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:30,959
Dave?

720
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:41,970
Dave?

721
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:09,420
In asia the idea that things
are made of opposites,

722
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,018
Ying and Yang, dates back 3,000 years.

723
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,697
That was them saying change
is the only constant,

724
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,438
But that just died in the west.

725
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,441
It just couldn't be both,
couldn't be black and white.

726
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:23,706
It would be right and wrong.
It had to be one or the other.

727
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,447
Who am I to say
that aristotle is wrong, right,

728
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,710
but that doesn't make any sense.

729
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,712
These things need each other.

730
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,719
The idea that all
God's creations are "perfect"-

731
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:44,728
So just to suggest that a tree,
it's crooked and it's straight,

732
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,729
It's strong and it's weak, is to suggest

733
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,472
That god created something imperfect.

734
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,735
They do however
acknowledge it in people.

735
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:58,479
We are sinners, but we can
strive to be good,

736
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:06,477
Just not in nature itself, I guess.

737
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,752
Oh, I've got to go.

738
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:18,559
You guys write down what's on the board.

739
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,503
"Broward County Florida
Middle schools mistakenly

740
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,768
"failed over 6500 students
In June due to what

741
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,770
"later called a computer error.

742
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:34,777
"A school official called the
total count of students affected.

743
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:43,584
An insignificant sum."

744
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:53,535
What goes, Danny boy? How's history?

745
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,570
I can't do it anymore.

746
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,539
Oh, I know the feeling.

747
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,127
Hang in there. Things will get better.

748
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:08,609
And if not, There's always summer.

749
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:18,619
Don't you have class right now?

750
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,564
Look, look, look, that's him over there.

751
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,566
That ain't even your bike, though.

752
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,566
That's my bike.

753
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,864
There he go right there.

754
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,572
He a little round one too.

755
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,572
This my bike, nigger.

756
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,043
What the fuck you doing on my bike?

757
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,578
You ain't know it was mines?

758
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:39,579
What you mean
you ain't know it was mines?

759
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,582
You always see me on this bike.

760
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,582
Sorry.

761
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:46,587
I just didn't know it was your bike.

762
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,852
You hella sorry, nigger.
I should fuck you up.

763
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:56,859
Get off my bike.

764
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,108
I thought you Was going fuck him up?

765
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,864
Didn't have to.

766
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,607
Oh, shit, okay, you didn't have to.

767
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,239
Hey.

768
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,916
Hey.

769
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,918
It's back.

770
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,226
Yeah.

771
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:04,926
Did you know my brother?

772
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,694
I knew of him, but I didn't, you know.

773
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:18,680
He wasn't in any of my classes
or anything.

774
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:24,947
You think I could end up like him?

775
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:26,254
Do you?

776
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,984
He's got a 7-Up in his Mother fucking-.

777
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:09,720
Hey, what's up, teach?
How's the Dianetics going?

778
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,993
It's Dialectics. Can I talk to you?

779
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:13,995
What's up?

780
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,738
Okay, look, I hate to be this
guy right now, right?

781
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:21,742
Mm-hmm.

782
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,005
Excuse me?

783
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,573
You heard me, okay,
so just do me this solid.

784
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,747
All right, man, please?

785
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,010
Do you a solid?

786
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,013
You know what I'm saying.
You understand me.

787
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:34,754
She's too precious kind of shit?

788
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:35,755
I'm not kidding.

789
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:36,756
Oh, I know.

790
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,760
So you understand?

791
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,023
Look, man, Drey is my family.
She's my friend, man.

792
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,026
All these cats, these are my friends.

793
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,435
And would you like to be my friend, man?

794
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,768
What the fuck is this,

795
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:51,772
What the fuck is a romper room?

796
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,120
Are you fucking listening to me?

797
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,203
Why are you so fucking angry, man?

798
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,207
Tell me what you're talking about.

799
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,045
Are you capable of that?

800
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:08,050
So now we back to the point of
what is white is right, right?

801
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,051
So-

802
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,791
Fuck, this has nothing to do
with that and you know it.

803
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,654
No, no, it's good for Drey
to have somebody.

804
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:17,821
Like you looking out for her
Mr. Model A1 fucking citizen.

805
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:25,900
I don't know, I don't know.

806
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,079
Fuck.

807
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:41,083
Because I'm supposed
to do something, right?

808
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:49,890
But what am I supposed to do?

809
01:12:52,901 --> 01:13:00,103
Look, man, you want a drink?

810
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,877
What?

811
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,306
Motherfucker, do you want a drink?

812
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,113
I mean, are you thirsty? How that sound?

813
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,114
Okay.

814
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:20,122
You want some candy?

815
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:23,124
Man, don't touch that cat.

816
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,866
Hey, y'all this is teach Dan, man.

817
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,128
These are my boys.

818
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,936
That's Mike's little sister
Drey, that's her teach.

819
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,133
What's happening?

820
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,875
You ain't bringing
that shit in my house, man.

821
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:40,882
Put that cat down.
Get your ass out here.

822
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:31,992
Dunn, what's going on?

823
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:42,002
I am not now nor have
I ever been a communist.

824
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,954
What's happening?

825
01:14:54,022 --> 01:15:02,022
Just in the neighborhood,
thought maybe I'd surprise you.

826
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:11,962
Yeah, it's a surprise. That's true.

827
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,235
You okay?

828
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:15,975
Yeah, I'm good.

829
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,238
How about you? How are you?

830
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:24,246
I'm good, a little tired, but I'm good.

831
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,988
Oh, is it late?

832
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:33,255
Well, you know, what time is it?
2:30, yeah.

833
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:34,994
Oh.

834
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:35,995
Yeah.

835
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,584
Well, you know, we got class tomorrow.

836
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:44,995
Oh, I forgot about class.
I'm sorry about last time.

837
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:50,272
Okay. It's okay.

838
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:58,281
Dunn, not right now, okay? No.

839
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,282
Dunn-Okay, you're drunk.

840
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:10,090
What are you doing? Stop it.

841
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:44,064
Well, that was weird.

842
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:49,069
What the fuck was that?

843
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:55,076
I don't know.

844
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,078
Listen, feel free To whatever, you know?

845
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,340
Whatever. No hard feelings.

846
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:08,148
I completely understand, okay?

847
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,094
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?

848
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,356
Or not, I don't know.

849
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:25,165
I'm so fucked up right now.

850
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:32,374
I hope you know I really liked you.

851
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:38,118
I had fun.

852
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,383
Not tonight I didn't have fun,
but other nights I had-

853
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:50,190
We had fun, right?

854
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:57,399
Look, I'm bleeding a bit so I'm
using your couch arm thing.

855
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:06,206
I'm gonna wash it, okay?

856
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:09,717
Sorry.

857
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,497
What.

858
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,239
How's things.

859
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:45,507
Well, how's it look?

860
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,249
What do you want?

861
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:49,861
Nothing.

862
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,258
Look, you know,
you don't really see other kids

863
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:03,525
Coming up to my car, Drey,
to talk to me.

864
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:08,530
It's, you know, I'm your teacher.

865
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,534
I'm not your friend.

866
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,536
Why don't you go play
with other kids your own age?

867
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:20,280
I'm just trying to be alone.

868
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:27,277
Then be alone then, asshole.

869
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:27,855
Bitch.

870
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:20,400
Hey, I think Henderson
was looking for you.

871
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,369
Must be about the new curriculum, huh?

872
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:33,354
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's it,
but, hey, Dan,

873
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,355
If there's anything else
going on, you know,

874
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:42,625
If you need any help,
you know, anything,

875
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:51,431
You know we're here for you, pal.

876
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:58,397
Lose the door.

877
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:19,459
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

878
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:29,432
On September 11, 1973,
The CIA helped overthrow

879
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:33,413
and murder democratically
Elected Chilean president Salvador Allende.

880
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,241
The military coup led
To mass disappearances,

881
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,678
assassinations and tortures Of thousands

882
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,420
Of Chilean civilians
under the leadership

883
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,423
Of U.S. backed dictator
Augusto Pinochet.

884
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,686
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger

885
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,691
Said of Allende's 1970
Election, "these issues are much"

886
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:58,498
Too important for the Chilean
voters to decide for themselves."

887
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,440
Danny?

888
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,705
What happened to your lip?

889
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,360
That's plenty, thanks.

890
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:09,448
That's good.

891
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,713
You're writing a novel?

892
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,241
It's a kids book
that I haven't started yet.

893
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,457
I love children's books.
What's it about?

894
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,719
Dialectics.

895
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,724
Dialectics. What is that?

896
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:29,731
It's a theory that attempts
to explain how change works.

897
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,474
How does change work, Dan?

898
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,476
Let's save it for dessert, Dad.

899
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:38,739
Yeah, it was really great.

900
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:41,027
There were like 400,000 people there.

901
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,517
Oh, that's fantastic.

902
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,386
What did they report it
in the press, 200,000?

903
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,487
Danny Glover was there.

904
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,487
Danny Glover, oh, I like him.

905
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,490
Mm-hmm.

906
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:52,491
What was that-

907
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:54,755
Hey, what was his name?

908
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:56,757
Charles.

909
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:58,532
Charles, get your fat ass off my bike,

910
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,498
That's what she said,
before I fuck your fat ass up.

911
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,502
You said that?

912
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,765
You know she did,
then my man started stressing.

913
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,901
He start apologizing. "I'm sorry."

914
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:09,136
I didn't know it was yours. I'm sorry."

915
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,512
Tell her.

916
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,512
Didn't have to.

917
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,776
Ah, didn't have to.

918
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,785
That's my girl right there,
poking people on the street.

919
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,526
Oh, Danny, you won't believe
what I found this week.

920
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:29,529
You guys really live it up around here.

921
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:33,795
You hear that, the rock star
approved, Cindy Lou Who.

922
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:35,963
Come on, Jeff, didn't you tell her

923
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,801
Around here we always party
like it's 1999.

924
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,803
Oh, my god, can you be
any more embarrassing.

925
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,547
No. Check out this scar?

926
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,549
Remember?

927
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,812
Remember this one?

928
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,120
Jesus.

929
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,855
Why you got these scary things?

930
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:39,599
Got them off the internet,
Some dude in Texas.

931
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,862
I wouldn't want these things
in my house.

932
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,606
Well, they in my house
and my house is your house.

933
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:54,674
So deal with it.

934
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,623
You ever sell to Coach?

935
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:04,885
Why?

936
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,890
Just wondering.

937
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:10,629
Look, don't you think
you and Teach's relationship

938
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,630
Is a little-

939
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,635
Inappropriate?

940
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,639
He your teacher, Drey.

941
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,900
He's my friend.

942
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:27,909
Look, he's a basehead, all right,
and baseheads don't have friends.

943
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:33,653
I mean, this motherfucker
was outside my house yesterday

944
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,656
Telling me that we shouldn't
be associated with each other.

945
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,694
I'm gonna take a freight train,

946
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,957
Down at the station, Lord

947
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:22,964
I don't care where it goes

948
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:29,710
Gonna climb me a mountain,
the highest mountain, Lord

949
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,972
Gonna jump off, nobody gonna know

950
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,716
Hey, teach me something, Dan.

951
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:42,984
Teach me some ebonics.

952
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:48,990
Is that what they got
you teaching in that zoo?

953
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:50,729
Hey, tell me something.

954
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:58,798
How do you say asshole In ebonics?

955
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:10,740
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry I'm an asshole.

956
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:15,755
I love you. You know that, right?

957
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:20,021
Yeah, I know.

958
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:24,764
All right. Good, good.

959
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:32,832
241, apartment three.

960
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,842
Hello? What's up?

961
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:51,791
I bet you are so good
with those kids, Daniel Dunn.

962
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,794
Thanks, Mom.

963
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:59,799
Sometimes I think we're the
only thing keeping them sane.

964
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:00,799
It's a good thing, you know, to teach.

965
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:03,803
Your father and I thought we were going

966
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,803
To change the world
when we were young, you know.

967
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,066
What did we know?

968
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,068
Well, you stopped a war so-

969
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,070
You think so?

970
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:11,810
Yeah.

971
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:15,076
That's nice, honey.

972
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,819
Than anything we did, you know?

973
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:24,085
One man alone means nothing.

974
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:28,828
I guess not.
Do you hear from Rachel anymore?

975
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,090
Not really.

976
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,832
I saw her at the pharmacy the other day,

977
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,836
Maybe it's her Mom.

978
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,838
You know, she looked great.

979
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:43,843
You should give her a call, but,
you know, clean up a little first.

980
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,106
You're killing me with the tie, okay.

981
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:51,851
Stop, I'm fine.

982
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,114
You happy?

983
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:57,117
I'm so happy.

984
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,860
That's so great, sweetie.
You're happy, I'm happy.

985
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:08,858
Watch the basketballs, Okay, honey?

986
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:09,548
Hey, Mom.

987
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,157
How was it? Easy, right?

988
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,899
I saw you shaking all across
the street and shit.

989
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,808
It sure beats the hell
out of flipping burgers.

990
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:42,649
Thank you.

991
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:10,931
Your Mom said there's
more wine out here.

992
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:14,195
I found it.

993
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,197
Do you like my brother?

994
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,200
Yeah.

995
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:24,205
Why?

996
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:31,941
He's nice. He's funny.

997
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,215
Sometimes.

998
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,957
Like what?

999
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:44,954
Like knock, knock.

1000
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,226
Who's there?

1001
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:50,231
The interrupting cow.

1002
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:58,240
The interrupting-Moo.

1003
01:31:59,046 --> 01:31:59,546
Yeah?

1004
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:57,036
Where you going? Come inside, sweetie.

1005
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:05,034
Ain't nobody going to bite you.

1006
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:52,211
Everything cool?

1007
01:34:53,220 --> 01:35:00,422
I guess we should get you home then.

1008
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,215
I don't think It's a good idea

1009
01:35:56,283 --> 01:36:00,219
You falling asleep in front
of the tv every night.

1010
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,482
What's up, Drey? You in a funk today?

1011
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:08,227
Want to tell me why?

1012
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:11,230
Just thinking about Mike, I guess.

1013
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,493
I miss your brother, too.

1014
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:20,240
We'll go see him as soon
As I get some time off.

1015
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:22,582
I can't believe they hit me
with another double tomorrow.

1016
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:31,240
Can you believe that?
I can't get a goddamn break.

1017
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:35,254
So what else is happening?

1018
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,254
I heard something about
a civil rights thing

1019
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:40,521
With Oprah or something.

1020
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:41,828
Drey?

1021
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:57,276
Hi, honey, just calling to let you know

1022
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,279
How much fun it was for us last night,

1023
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:02,542
and we should do it more often.

1024
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:11,350
I love you, sweetie. Call us soon, okay?

1025
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:35,621
Hello, everyone. I'm Mr. Light.

1026
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:39,579
I really don't know.

1027
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:43,322
When's he coming back?

1028
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:44,584
They're not really telling me
Too much in the office.

1029
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:53,392
Why don't you guys tell me
What you've been learning?

1030
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:07,345
I don't know.

1031
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,348
What's good with you?

1032
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:10,610
Chilling. Need a ride?

1033
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:12,612
No, I got my bike.

1034
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,352
Well, throw it in the back.

1035
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:16,355
I got to get home.

1036
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:17,617
Well, I'll take you.

1037
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:23,362
Drey?

1038
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:31,430
Look, I'll see you around, huh?

1039
01:39:16,483 --> 01:39:18,417
What happened to your friends?

1040
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:19,369
They're gone.

1041
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:29,689
You missed a hell of a party.

1042
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:31,449
Looks like it.

1043
01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:56,202
Thank you.

1044
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:09,035
Ouch.

1045
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:24,882
You ready to go?

1046
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:57,576
You missed a spot.

1047
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,795
Knock knock.

1048
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:17,797
Who's there?

1049
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:20,539
The interrupting cow.

1050
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:27,547
The interrupting cow who?

1051
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:28,114
Moo.

1052
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,814
That was horrible.

1053
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:36,122
Yeah.

1054
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:11,650
