1
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,615
<i>This is Julian.
Leave a message.</i>

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,183
<i>Hey, Julian, it's Ricky.</i>

3
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,024
<i>I got your message
about working tonight.</i>

4
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,429
<i>I guess I can probably work,
but I'm telling you one thing,</i>

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,525
<i>I'm need to get drunk as fuck.</i>

6
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,695
<i>And I need some good
fuckin' dope, Julian,</i>

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>if I'm working for you tonight.
Not that shitty fuckin' mall dope</i>

8
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,071
<i>you usually show up here with.
Let's get high,</i>

9
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,634
<i>let's get drunk,
and we'll do this fuckin' job.</i>

10
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,496
Did I tell him to meet us

11
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,402
- 15 minutes ago?
- Yes.

12
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,839
It's Ricky.

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,740
- Where the hell are ya?!
- Where is he?

14
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,642
Listen, I told you to be ready

15
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,508
<i>15 minutes ago!</i>

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,140
I gotta do some family stuff.
Lucy's freakin'...

17
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,914
Hey, Rick. Are you talking
on the phone to Julian?

18
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:27,918
Just a second.

19
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,182
No, I'm just in here
using the bathroom.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,020
Why do have to lie to her?
Why can't you just tell her,

21
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,529
"I need to make some money
to support the family." Huh?

22
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,655
Look, if you're masturbating,
it's cool.

23
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,722
<i>Just say, "Hey,
I'm masturbating." No big deal!</i>

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,825
Yeah, I'm masturbating
big-time, Lucy.

25
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,462
Should you be on the phone
with him if he's masturbating?

26
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,630
...stuff cooked? Stuff...

27
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,970
Jesus Christ! I'm trying
to talk to Tony here!

28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,236
The only reason
Lucy's pissed off

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,403
is because we don't have
a lot of money right now.

30
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,004
I'm not growing dope and I spent
our grocery money. I was wrong.

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,343
I want him close to me.

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,316
I want him
to be Trinity's father.

33
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,578
He is a good parent.

34
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,449
But until he stops working
with Julian,

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,045
he can forget
about being inside.

36
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,784
Lucy says
I can't come in the trailer.

37
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,723
No big deal.
I'm used to living in cars.

38
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,658
I've been living in cars
most of my life.

39
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,059
And people
kinda make fun of me,

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,360
<i>throw bottles at me, say,
"How can you live in a car?"</i>

41
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,491
<i>But they just don't understand.
It's not that bad.</i>

42
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,463
<i>The way I look at it,</i>

43
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,006
<i>my car is kinda like
our family's cottage.</i>

44
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:21,870
<i>Trin comes out.</i>

45
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,136
<i>She helps me cook and stuff.
We have a good time.</i>

46
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,041
<i>Lucy comes out to the car
once in awhile,</i>

47
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,579
we smoke some dope,
get drunk.

48
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,115
I'll bang Ricky.
I'll go visit him in his car.

49
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,275
I don't give a shit,

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,410
but he is not having sex
with me in my bed.

51
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,681
<i>I've got everything
I need out here.</i>

52
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,723
<i>Enough make my own food
and take care of myself.</i>

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,553
<i>I don't owe anybody anything
in this park.</i>

54
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,060
<i>I don't pay lot fees,
'cause I live in my car.</i>

55
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,359
<i>It's awesome.
And basically my attitude is,</i>

56
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,796
<i>I don't cause problems in this park.</i>

57
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,528
<i>You don't fuck with me,
I'm not gonna fuck with you.</i>

58
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,899
But don't fuck with me,

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,200
'cause I'm gonna start
fuckin' with you big-time.

60
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,047
Oh, fuckin' look who it is.

61
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,811
I don't know
what he's doing here.

62
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,580
Julian, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

63
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,645
We don't have time
for this, Ricky. Let's go!

64
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,350
Yeah,
you're getting drunk tonight, -

65
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,791
- but you're also working.
- I'm gonna call into work

66
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,192
for a couple of hours.
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,422
They couldn't find
Cory and Trevor;

68
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,987
if I don't work,
I'm getting fired.

69
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:19,895
And we need the money,

70
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,900
you know that.

71
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,095
Lucy, come here.

72
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,365
Look, I'll only gonna be
working for a couple hours.

73
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,270
I'll stop and get
a big bucket of chicken,

74
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,002
go to the liquor store,
get some great hash.

75
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,338
We'll get drunk,
smoke some dope,

76
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,106
and we'll bang tonight,
listening to April Wine.

77
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,080
Getting chicken
and banging, that's nice.

78
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,175
Fine.

79
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,345
- Be careful.
- I will.

80
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,956
Here's the clearing stick, Ricky.

81
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,685
All right, Bubbs,
black it out.

82
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,093
These fuckin' shitty tools.

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,754
Move it, move it.

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,424
All right, it's clear.

85
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,966
All right, Jules.

86
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,002
What the fuck is that?!

87
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,042
What's up, dudes?!

88
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,941
Where's the bank machine
we're gonna rob?!

89
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,003
Turn that shit off!

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,274
Sorry, Ricky.

91
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,713
What are you guys thinking?

92
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,580
What are you guys doing?
This is the big show.

93
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,854
You show up late,
you blow our cover?

94
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,360
Eh, boys?

95
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,058
We are never, ever,
working with you idiots again.

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,033
And...

97
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,331
I'm really considering
not hanging out

98
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,338
with you guys anymore.
What?

99
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,703
You don't have to do that, Ricky.

100
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,369
Ricky, you really hurt Cory
and Trevor's feelings there.

101
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,504
Bubbles, they're the stupidest
fuck giraffes

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,413
in the dumb-dumb salad.

103
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,542
Fuck giraffes.

104
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,419
Look, Ricky, I know,
but you made them cry.

105
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,320
We're a little sick

106
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,949
of messing up, Julian,
every time.

107
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,927
That's not right.
They're our friends.

108
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,759
Now apologize.

109
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,458
I didn't mean
to make them cry.

110
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,728
Ricky, get over here
and apologize to these guys.

111
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:36,626
Jesus Christ.

112
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,900
You don't have
to bother apologizing, Ricky.

113
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,064
Come on.

114
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,868
Cory, Trevor,

115
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,843
I'm sorry I made you guys cry,
all right?

116
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,311
I'm not crying.

117
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,644
Now get the fuck out of here.
You gotta go.

118
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,778
Fuck!

119
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,257
Ricky, don't electra-cocksuck
yourself now.

120
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,262
Delicate, Ricky, delicate!

121
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,826
That's blue dye under pressure.

122
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,390
That whore blows
and we all look

123
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,664
like those blue, bald-headed dicks
that beat the drums.

124
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,898
Got it!

125
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,775
I'm surprised.

126
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,644
This is going really well, boys.

127
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,390
Holy fuck! My car!
I don't have fuckin' insurance!

128
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,483
Let's get the hell out of here, now!

129
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,152
Wait, Julian.

130
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,924
- Ricky, come on!
- Two seconds.

131
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,487
Ricky, I'm leaving without ya!

132
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,726
Julian, I'm taking a couple
of cartons of cigarettes.

133
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,768
Big deal!

134
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,137
Just a couple of cartons
of smokes, eh, Ricky?

135
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,642
Bubbles, they were free.
I couldn't leave them there.

136
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,611
I think we're okay, boys.

137
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,818
Boys, there's something flying
behind us right now

138
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,118
that looks just like
a police hell-a-cocksucker.

139
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,988
There's a fuckin'
hell-a-cocksucker behind us!

140
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,157
What do we do?!

141
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,670
Get rid of the evidence!

142
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,804
This fucker gonna
get to us, Julian?

143
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,716
<i>I've got visual contact
heading due east Highway 7.</i>

144
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,116
Julian, you gotta pull over,
man. I gotta piss!

145
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,950
Ricky, we're being pursued
by the cops!

146
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,421
No! Not gonna happen!

147
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,014
I can't hold it! I can't!

148
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,183
Sorry, Julian,

149
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,591
but I am not gonna piss myself,
man!

150
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,924
Out of the car, Bubbs.

151
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,725
I'm not going anywhere
without you guys!

152
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,857
We're gonna get busted,
Bubbles. Come on!

153
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,377
<i>This guy's stopped. «/i»</i>

154
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,714
<i>He's urinating.
He just pissed on himself here.</i>

155
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,883
You better not put this
on the fuckin' news!

156
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,189
God, that was a good piss!

157
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,120
Fuck. Fuck.

158
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,689
- I told you not to stop!
- No big deal.

159
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,203
- We can talk our way out of this.
- I'm gonna freeze up. I can't do this.

160
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,932
Don't move!
Hands where I can see them!

161
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,600
- Stop right there!
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

162
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,040
Where are you coming from?

163
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,340
- Just back at the mall.
- We're not asking you.

164
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,471
We're asking the guy
with the mixed drink,

165
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,106
driving the car.

166
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,379
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

167
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,148
Oh, real nice.

168
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,190
Making fun of a guy
who can't speak. He's mute.

169
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,749
He's deaf, too.
You got some jokes for that?

170
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,919
Maybe you can make him cry.

171
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,590
Anyway, guys,

172
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,133
I'm Trevor.

173
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,133
This is Cory.

174
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,727
Just put the guns away, guys.

175
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:02,240
You don't need your guns out.
We don't got fuckin' guns.

176
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,570
Put the guns down, seriously.

177
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,702
We don't need guns.
Put 'em away.

178
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,370
Talk it out.

179
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,038
I know
why you're pulling us over.

180
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,846
We set the alarms off at the
mall again, which is no big deal,

181
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,319
because we're
the window cleaners.

182
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,481
Terry,
a guy that works with us, idiot,

183
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,253
backs his truck in
and slams into the smoke shop,

184
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,726
set the alarm off.
Friend of mine,

185
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,490
so I took the cigarettes.

186
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,929
Didn't want anyone
to steal them.

187
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,192
Anyway, we're gonna go back,

188
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,063
fix it up, no problem at all.

189
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,626
Guys, you gotta understand here.

190
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,002
I could lose my job over this
and I've got four kids.

191
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,236
What you doing running
a police chopper, Trevor,

192
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,777
with four kids?

193
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,041
We wasn't. I knew some shit
was obviously fucked up

194
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,345
and we saw the big,
stupid chopper in the sky

195
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,715
and pulled right over.

196
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,447
Seriously,
we're just gonna get goin'.

197
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,113
We got a lot of work to do,

198
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,213
fixing that window
and everything.

199
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,382
All right, Frank.

200
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,449
Listen, this is what
you're gonna do.

201
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,155
You're gonna go back,
clean up, get the alarms off,

202
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,161
call the security company,

203
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,425
so we don't have
to deal with it.

204
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,466
- All right?
- No problem.

205
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,899
Once you're done with that,

206
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,995
you gotta get this car legal
as soon as you can, okay?

207
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,165
- You got lucky tonight.
- You guys are really good cops.

208
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,867
You guys did... it was great.

209
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,773
- The way you had the chopper...
- Yeah, yeah...

210
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,641
You were right on us.
It was good.

211
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,374
- Thanks, Officer.
- All right, take off.

212
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,244
Appreciate it.

213
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,805
What about you, Cory?

214
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,646
You got kids?

215
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,880
No.

216
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,819
Out of the vehicle.

217
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,517
I fuckin' had these dummies,
Julian! They're stupid!

218
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,320
Out of the car!

219
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,554
You had to take a piss,
didn't you? You fuckhead!

220
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,824
You were supposed to be deaf!
That door doesn't work!

221
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,330
Take him out this side,
please!

222
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,061
Oh, nice sign language, Rick!
What the fuck was that?

223
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,069
I'm trying here, Julian!

224
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,193
He's not a bad goalie,

225
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,736
but he's dumb.

226
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,704
Ya suck, Ricky!

227
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,071
Get off the court!

228
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,702
I told you guys,
your time is up!

229
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,576
Suck it, Donny.

230
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,208
You suck it... more!

231
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,946
What kind of a comeback
was that?

232
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,250
I said suck it and you
just added "more" to it.

233
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,257
Because it's more.
You suck it more.

234
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,691
Fuckin' cocky chop, fuck-linker.

235
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,729
- Let's go, boys.
- That didn't make any sense.

236
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,027
Watch when you talk to me.
You're spittin' all over.

237
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,327
You guys fuckin' suck.

238
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,664
Donny is a fuckin' prick.
He's a senior guard,

239
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,533
and he's jealous,
'cause I came up

240
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,969
with the ball-hockey-league
idea.

241
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,939
I'm having a good time.
I've got 26 days left.

242
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,306
I plan on playing ball hockey
every day

243
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,675
and beating the guards
in the hockey tournament.

244
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,303
And Julian,

245
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,711
Julian's not having a good time.

246
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,305
He just drinks potato vodka
and lifts weights.

247
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,681
And I've seen a lot of guys
go down that road.

248
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,481
It's not a good road
to go down.

249
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,954
He's not happy in here,
and he should be playing hockey.

250
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,581
If he was playing hockey
and smoking dope,

251
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,818
Julian would be so much happier

252
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,257
than lifting weights
and drinking potato vodka.

253
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,124
That's what he chooses
to do, I guess.

254
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,564
Tell me something,

255
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,428
how did you get the name
Cadillac, anyway?

256
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,593
Because I'm smooth,

257
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,762
I drive straight,

258
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,135
and I got power-

259
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,503
personal power.

260
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,337
Took old Cadillac 29 years

261
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,001
to figure it out.
A lot of times,

262
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,476
the cons get out of jail, right?

263
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,013
And they want to do the
big dirty, that one big job -

264
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,673
you know,
make a lot of money, retire.

265
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,183
They end up retiring
back in here.

266
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,242
I did the big dirty.
You see where I am?

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,788
Forget the big dirty
when you get out. Don't do that.

268
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,586
Lots of guys here say
the big dirty's the way to go.

269
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,717
You find one big job,
do it right - no witnesses.

270
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,421
'Cause witnesses give up
prescriptions to the police;

271
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,396
once the police has your prescription,
you're fucked.

272
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,523
It's all about change, boy.

273
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,999
Change and nothing else.

274
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm a criminal, Cadillac.
I can't change now, man.

275
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,535
I ain't talking
about that kind of change.

276
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,204
That's brilliant, man.

277
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,771
So if I do the big dirty,
then I can retire from crime,

278
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,340
have all the time in the world
to spend time with my family;

279
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,909
get my family life going again.
So that's what I'm doing.

280
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,479
Soon as I get out of here,
I'm doing the big dirty.

281
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,319
It's fuckin' perfect.

282
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,483
All right!

283
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,061
News flash!

284
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,061
Line up!

285
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,461
Hurry up.

286
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,329
Fuck off, Donny, you dick!

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,731
Who said that?!

288
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,771
Look what I got.

289
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,567
You're not gonna like this.

290
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,006
Well, ladies,
I got some news for ya!

291
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,565
Donny, what are you doing?

292
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,407
I'll tell ya what I'm doing, Ricky.

293
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,538
This prison's overcrowded

294
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,582
with dicks
and muscle dummies!

295
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,017
So I put in a word
with the warden

296
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,113
to let Ricky and Julian
out 26 days early!

297
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,487
Don't forget change, man, change.

298
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,156
- I won't. I won't.
- Don't forget my box of shit,

299
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,664
all right?
My box of shit, baby.

300
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,859
What are you doing?

301
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,926
Fuckin' prick.

302
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,870
Do you not see the red line, Cadill-ass?

303
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,103
Movie night is done
because of Cadill-ass!

304
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,734
Fuckin' asshole!

305
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,279
I can see what you're
fuckin' doing here, Donny.

306
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,814
You're fixing
the hockey tournament,

307
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,409
'cause you know you can't win
if I'm playing on the nets.

308
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,009
Let it go, Ricky.

309
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,056
Let it go, Ricky.

310
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,681
You and your pretty hair

311
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,625
and your blue eyes
shining like the sky, huh?

312
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,492
Shut up.

313
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,428
I'm not leaving.
I got 30 days left.

314
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,931
I'm serving every one of them,

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,093
then we're gonna fuckin'
kick your ass in hockey.

316
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,136
You're in jail

317
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,966
and I'm gonna let you
out of jail

318
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,233
and you want to stay for a
stupid ball-hockey tournament?

319
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,104
'Cause we're gonna win
and you know it.

320
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,770
- You're not gonna to win Ricky.
- And you're attracted to Julian.

321
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,608
I'm not attracted to Julian.
I'm attracted...

322
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,045
Ahem.
I'm not attracted to Julian.

323
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,673
You keep going on
about his blue eyes, -

324
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,945
- his nice hair and everything.
- 'Cause that's what you do.

325
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,647
- Sounds a little weird to me.
- No, it's not weird. Shut up.

326
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,553
- I'm not fuckin' leaving.
- You're leaving.

327
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,149
No, I'm not fuckin'
going anywhere.

328
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,659
- Wanna prove it?
- Sure.

329
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,161
Prove it.
Leonard, Duncan...

330
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,789
- Aw, you got to be kiddin'.
- Get this prick out of my jail.

331
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,231
This is such bullshit, Donny.
Gonna throw me out of jail, huh?

332
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,531
I've got every right
to be in this fuckin' jail,

333
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,865
serve my sentence!

334
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,200
Darren, you gotta play nets!

335
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,207
Wayne, don't get drunk
before the games!

336
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,902
Steve, move up to left wing!

337
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,410
Fuck sakes, you fuckers!

338
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,208
If I fuckin' see you
on the outside, Donny,

339
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,646
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass!

340
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,876
Ricky,
I'll fight you anyplace,

341
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,816
anytime, anywhere.

342
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,914
Donny, it's Ricky.

343
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,983
Look, man,
I'm sorry I freaked out.

344
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,052
You gotta please
let me back in jail.

345
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,155
Please let me play
in the hockey tournament.

346
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,257
Donny, come on. I'm sorry.

347
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,766
<i>No chance, Ricky.</i>

348
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,963
<i>You suck it!</i>

349
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,406
No matter how many times
those guys go to jail,

350
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,102
it just never gets easier.

351
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,509
I mean,
me and Ricky and Julian,

352
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,910
we grew up together

353
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,040
and we're closer
than brothers, so...

354
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,711
I mean, when they go to jail,
everything just stops for me.

355
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,312
I just end up, you know,

356
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,584
working on dirty
old shopping carts.

357
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,292
Fixing them up, selling
them back to the grocery stores.

358
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,660
I only make
about 80 bucks a month.

359
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,996
You know, just enough
for cat food and lot fees.

360
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,832
Who's a good boy?

361
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,634
Half the time, all I can do
is just mark off days

362
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,766
on the calendar,
waiting for them to get out.

363
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,010
Dad! Bubbles!

364
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,417
I'm really proud
of my boy, Rick,

365
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,577
'cause as soon
as he gets out of jail,

366
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,052
he goes right back to work.

367
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,851
I, unfortunately,
haven't been able to work

368
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,360
since the accident, so...
stuck in this thing. It sucks.

369
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,394
But, you know,

370
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,898
at least I get a government
disability check every month

371
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,025
and, you know, I...
keep getting one, you know,

372
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,536
as long as I'm careful, so...

373
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,303
Hey, Ray.

374
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,240
- Boys. Hey, Ricky.
- Hey, Dad.

375
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,039
Aw, man,
is it ever good to see you.

376
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,977
- I missed you, buddy.
- I missed you too, bud.

377
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,605
No way.

378
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,876
You got me
some dope plants?

379
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,417
- Check it out.
- Old man came through!

380
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,543
Ah, yeah.

381
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,246
Check it out, boys!

382
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,621
- Hey, Bubbles.
- Ricky!

383
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,820
Dad, let me tell ya, thinked
over a lot of stuff in jail.

384
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,056
It's just gonna come
about my family now.

385
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,065
I gotta be a better dad
for Trin,

386
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,657
and I want Lucy back.

387
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,334
Yeah, dude, what's up?!

388
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,999
All right!

389
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,975
<i>Okay, we'll followyou!</i>

390
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,585
What do the fuck do these
dicks here think they're doin'?

391
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,959
Don't start any shit
with them, Rick.

392
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,657
Exit the vehicle, please,
gentlemen.

393
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,633
Heard you boys
were getting out today.

394
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,794
Welcome back to Sunnyvale,
Julian.

395
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,497
- Jim.
- Ricky.

396
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,268
We need to go over
some new park laws, boys.

397
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,569
What?

398
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,907
You're not a cop anymore,
remember? You got fired.

399
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,912
You're just a drunk
trailer-park supervisor now.

400
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,446
Capeek?

401
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,314
Actually, I resigned
from the force, Ricky.

402
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,511
Resigned?

403
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,555
Yeah, I make, uh, $16,500 here,

404
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,613
at Sunnyvale, as supervisor.

405
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,353
Randy makes $4,600.
That's pretty good money.

406
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,885
First 10 years I ran this park,
things were simply perfection.

407
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,297
Trailers were well-kept,
people respected each other.

408
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,857
Then things changed.

409
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,497
Things changed with Julian,
Bubbles and...

410
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,063
mostly Ricky.

411
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,974
Better watch the way you speak
to Mr. Lahey, Rick!

412
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,342
You better watch the way
you go fuck yourself, Randy.

413
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,744
Ricky! Ricky!

414
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,180
It's all right!
It's all right!

415
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,377
Come on, look,
we got catching up to do.

416
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,010
Let's just go.

417
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,214
I'll tell you right now,
leave us alone!

418
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,154
Go get drunk,
supervise the park.

419
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,023
Mr. Lahey hasn't had a drink
in almost two months!

420
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:49,719
Come on, Ricky,

421
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,025
let's start things off
on the right foot here.

422
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,324
All right, Randy.

423
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,890
I've been a bit
stressed out lately.

424
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,561
Shouldn't be takin' it
out on you guys.

425
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,003
Sorry, Jim. Didn't realize
you quit drinking.

426
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,665
Rick.

427
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,175
We don't want any trouble here, guys.

428
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,211
Okay?

429
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,410
Julian.

430
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,315
This is great, boys.

431
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,976
Listen,
we all want the same thing.

432
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,612
For Sunnyvale Trailer Park
to be a nice place to live,

433
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,087
just like it used to be.

434
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,921
No problem, Mr. Lahey.
We're just happy to be home.

435
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,757
So, we good here?
Can we go through the gate now?

436
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,229
Sure, Rick.
Keep your nose clean.

437
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,392
Randy, open the gate.

438
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,026
Won't be necessary, Randy.

439
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,095
You guys can both fuck off.

440
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,783
Randy, don't let me start
drinking again, bud.

441
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,632
- Whazzup?!
- Whazzup?!

442
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,639
Whazzup? I told you to stop
saying that three years ago.

443
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,905
Now get the fuck away from me.
Come up with somethin' better.

444
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,071
Cory and Trevor
are so fuckin' stupid.

445
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,047
They run around
saying they got their grade six,

446
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,582
but nobody remembers them
in grade six.

447
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,947
I remember them in grade five.

448
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,111
But one thing I do know
about Cory and Trevor,

449
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,087
their brains work
on the same level as horses.

450
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,714
I mean,
they look around like horses.

451
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,351
They hear a loud noise
they get scared like a horse.

452
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,294
They're unpredictable.
Just so fuckin' dumb.

453
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,660
See you guys later, all right?

454
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,596
Stay for a couple drinks
with the boys.

455
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,099
Come on, you just got out.

456
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,635
I'm spending the night
with Lucy tonight.

457
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,295
I'm getting drunk
with my family.

458
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,134
What are Bubbles, Julian
and the old man,

459
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,104
if not your family?

460
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,039
Come to Lucy's.
We'll get stoned,

461
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,475
get drunk as fuck.
It'll be a great night.

462
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,206
I gotta go, though.
Ricky? Rick!

463
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,307
God, Ray,
should we have told him -

464
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,012
- what's going on with Lucy?
- No, man, he's...

465
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,783
he's gotta figure this one out
for himself, buddy.

466
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,574
You're a month early.

467
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,509
What the fuck
are you doing here?

468
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,604
I live here, Ricky.

469
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,706
You think Lucy can pay
the rent by herself?

470
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,479
I'm out of jail now,
so I'll be taking care of the fees,

471
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,349
'cause I'm gonna be making
a shitload of money.

472
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,116
I want you to stay
the fuck away

473
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,713
from Lucy and Trinity.
I'm serious.

474
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,055
I want to talk to Lucy
and Trinity right now.

475
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,654
- I'm fuck-offious.
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

476
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,254
Lucy's not gay anymore,
Sarah.

477
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,664
She hasn't done gay shit
since high school.

478
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,396
Lucy never graduated
from high school, Ricky.

479
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,233
I never graduated either
and I'm not gay.

480
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,796
That's not what I heard.

481
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,432
What, were you talking to Julian?

482
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,409
I knew Lucy
was only an eighth gay.

483
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,412
She banged a lot of chicks back
in high school, including Sarah.

484
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,573
I banged a lot of chicks
back in high school,

485
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,116
including Sarah,
so it kinda cancels out.

486
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,084
One night, me and Lucy got drunk,
started talking,

487
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,713
realized both of us were banging
a lot of the same chicks.

488
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,450
One thing led to another,
kinda got together,

489
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,014
and we're just going
from there.

490
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,220
Oh, you haven't heard
about Lucy's new job yet, have you?

491
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,762
Lucy's working?

492
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,559
She's got an awesome new job.

493
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,896
What new job? She working
down at Horton's again?

494
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,901
She doesn't need you
anymore for anything.

495
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,300
Nice flowers.

496
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,566
What're you talking about, Sarah?

497
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,799
Where is she, Sarah?!

498
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,709
She's in "fuck-off land," Ricky!

499
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,278
Ricky worries me sometimes.
I got a great plan here

500
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,015
and I need him.
He's my wingman.

501
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,182
Don't need him gettin'
all screwed up over Lucy.

502
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,122
We don't have time for chicks
right now.

503
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,161
We gotta steal change.

504
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,662
How many hotdogs do you want, Julian?

505
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,824
- Four.
- Four?!

506
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,966
Well, I guess
I don't get any, then.

507
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,129
'Cause Ray's gonna have
half o' them!

508
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,797
- Give me two, then.
- No, no!

509
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,564
Oh, yeah, so you...

510
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,940
you just get out of jail
and now you're telling me

511
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,979
you're gonna be robbing
change out of parking meters.

512
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,174
That's fuckin' just great,
Julian.

513
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,514
Bubbs, it's way safer.
You can't go to jail.

514
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,987
We just got to talk Ricky
out of doing the big dirty.

515
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,148
It's stupid.
Hey.

516
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,582
Hey, Ricky.

517
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,285
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey, buddy.

518
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,588
Listen, Dad, Bubbs,

519
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,186
is there something you guys
aren't telling me about Lucy?

520
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,993
Bubbs, why don't you, uh...?

521
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,533
Ray, you...

522
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,327
Why do you always stick me
with the horseshit?!

523
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,340
Lucy got new boobs, Ricky.

524
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,569
Lucy got new boobs?

525
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,270
Why?
Lucy's body's perfect.

526
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,313
You oughta see it now, buddy.

527
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,574
Dad.

528
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,115
You saw Lucy naked?

529
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,447
Down at the Gentleman's Club, Rick.

530
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,749
They're not too big
and they're not too small.

531
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,119
Trevor, how the fuck
did you see Lucy naked?

532
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,782
At the Gentleman's Club.

533
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,621
She works
at the Gentleman's Club, Ricky.

534
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,058
That's what we're saying.

535
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,891
The strip club?

536
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,555
Gentleman's Club.

537
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,147
<i>It's been a hard day</i>

538
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,744
<i>In the city</i>

539
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,757
<i>And it affects you
in the most peculiar way</i>

540
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,917
Straights!

541
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,025
<i>We've said all that
there is to say</i>

542
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,828
<i>And if you were
to ask me questions</i>

543
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,234
<i>You don't really want to know</i>

544
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,206
<i>Your concern is just for show</i>

545
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,712
<i>Just for show-oh-oh-oh</i>

546
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,672
<i>Your name's a number</i>

547
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,046
<i>Just press a button</i>

548
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,678
<i>Your memories lost
but they've not forgotten</i>

549
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,951
<i>They tried to break our...
our lust for passion</i>

550
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:57,461
<i>They tried to tell us
that it's not in fashion</i>

551
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,965
<i>And if you were
to ask me questions</i>

552
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,398
<i>What are we fighting for...</i>

553
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

554
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,601
Lucy, I just came here
to see you.

555
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,335
Can I have a hug?
I really missed you, in jail.

556
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,433
Okay, close enough.

557
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,376
There you go.
Nice big hug.

558
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,141
Oh, that was a nice hug.
- Mmm-hmm.

559
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,749
So how's Trinity doing?

560
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,082
Off the rails is how she's doing.
She's stealing barbecues again.

561
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,083
Yeah, things are really
different now, Rick.

562
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,784
Really different.

563
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,885
Why, are you bangin'
somebody or somethin'?

564
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,557
Hey, Sonny, this is Ricky.

565
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,999
Ricky, good to meet you, buddy!

566
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,899
How are ya?
I've heard a lot about you.

567
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,063
Rick, this is Sonny, my boss.

568
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,074
I own the joint.
What can I tell you?

569
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,077
So is everything good?
You gettin' everything you need?

570
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,444
- Yeah, we're fine.
- Great. It's a $10 cover.

571
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,785
Oh, you know what?
He's my guest.

572
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,548
Here's 10 bucks.

573
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,860
Stop digging in the ashtray,
will you, buddy?

574
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,027
This is a gentleman's club.

575
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,399
Look, I'm properly gentlemanly.

576
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,199
I just came here
to talk to Lucy.

577
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,603
You got a problem with that?

578
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,869
Can you just give us a minute?
Can we talk?

579
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,638
Yeah, hey, no problem.

580
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,144
What do you need?

581
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,077
You know,
it's a two-drink minimum,

582
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,776
and no touching the ladies,
Ricky, especially her.

583
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,545
You got two minutes.

584
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,087
Attaboy.

585
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,747
I'm gonna need you
in the VIP room.

586
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,847
Okay.

587
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,482
Fuckin' dick!

588
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,260
You know how much it is

589
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,029
to get into that room?
Twenty bucks!

590
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,071
You know how much cat food
I'd get for that?!

591
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,201
Good job, boys.

592
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,799
Go find some more.

593
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,004
Try to get me a vodka o. j.

594
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,383
I'm drinking gin and Seven, please.

595
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,010
I'm drinking rum and Coke.

596
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,281
Oh.

597
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,384
Okay.

598
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,992
You're good.

599
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,051
You're good. Okay.

600
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,097
Are you fucked?!

601
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,463
She's just trying to hustle me
for lap dances and drinks.

602
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,025
- It's part of her job. Chill out.
- So?!

603
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,505
Listen. We have no time
for women right now.

604
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,201
We gotta concentrate
on the job tomorrow

605
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,207
and stay focused, okay?

606
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,846
I'm focused, Julian.

607
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,813
She's looking over here.

608
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,906
Is she?

609
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,420
Julian, she's on fire!

610
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,357
God, this place makes me frisky!

611
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,699
Lucy, it's not just about
horny stuff this time.

612
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,897
There's love stuff, too.

613
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,837
Listen, we could have a couple drinks,

614
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,637
take care of the horny stuff,
but that's it.

615
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,042
Any chance I can get
a couple of cigarettes off ya?

616
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,273
Look, I gotta go.

617
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,009
No matter what happens
between you and me,

618
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,415
you gotta start growing dope,
and you gotta get some money.

619
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,782
You gotta get your life together.

620
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,619
Look... I didn't mean to be
so forward... earlier, you know?

621
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,886
I don't know anybody
around here.

622
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,893
Hmm.

623
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,930
So I'm just looking
for somebody to hang out with.

624
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,058
I didn't mean any harm.
You just seem like a good guy.

625
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,931
How about we go see
a movie sometime?

626
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,231
- Okay!
- Yeah?

627
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,566
Okay. Okay.

628
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,107
Julian, can we please
get the fuck out of here?!

629
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,407
You're friends
with the ashtray miner?

630
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,311
And you're stealing drinks too?

631
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,373
What did you just say to me, huh?

632
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,884
You see this drink?
It's my drink!

633
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,648
I brought it from home.
I don't steal fuckin' drinks, bud!

634
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,191
- Yeah, Tony, pool room, please.
- What kind of accusations?

635
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,352
We don't steal drinks,
thank you very much.

636
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,955
Bubbles, what the fuck is going on?

637
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,023
I got caught stealing drinks.

638
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,001
Listen, you tell
your little door pansies

639
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,766
to let go of my friends
and we'll leave like gentlemen.

640
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,467
Yeah. Okay, let 'em go.

641
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,101
You heard me, let 'em go.

642
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,476
Thanks, Sonny. Good times.

643
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,548
We need to make some money.

644
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,217
I know.

645
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,194
I promised Lucy
I can't work for you.

646
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,890
Ricky, if you want Lucy back,

647
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,728
you gotta start
growing dope again,

648
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,065
and you're gonna need lights,
tables, fertilizer.

649
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,071
Yup. That's why I'm doing
the big dirty.

650
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,472
No, you'll start stealing
change with me tomorrow, Rick.

651
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,065
Ricky.

652
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,943
Listen, I don't really want
to do this either, but, I mean,

653
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,675
I gotta get money
for cat food!

654
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,309
You know,
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

655
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,444
if you were in on that
with us, Ricky.

656
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,749
You know.

657
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,983
Rick, I don't want to do this
without you, okay?

658
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,753
We got a great team here.

659
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,953
Come on.

660
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,191
Please?
Please?

661
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,758
All right, I'll do it.

662
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:09,034
But the cock-muffin twins
better be on their game. No fuckups.

663
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,836
We start training
them tomorrow.

664
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,019
What the fuck?

665
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,698
What the fuck are you guys...?
Get the fuck out of my car!

666
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,031
<i>When you're looking
for something new</i>

667
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,366
<i>We've got a special friend
for you</i>

668
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,198
<i>Gives you more...
- Bubbs!</i>

669
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,676
<i>Our service...</i>

670
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,074
Bubbles, what the hell's
going on with your cats?

671
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,447
I thought they were trained.

672
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,645
They're in my car.
They pissed on my cigarettes.

673
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,415
- They're pooping in my dope.
- Well, Ricky,

674
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,615
did you notice how damp
it is in here?

675
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,057
Yeah, this shed is fucked.

676
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,889
They're not digging it in here,
right now.

677
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:04,724
They like your car,

678
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,229
'cause it's dry.

679
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,822
And, I mean,
these are free-range kitties,

680
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,460
you know that.
They do as they please.

681
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,163
I'm sorry, Bubbs.
I'm just grumpy.

682
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,103
I mean, the cats
kept me up all night,

683
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,800
and thinking about Julian
wanting to steal change

684
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,137
from parking meters.
It's embarrassing.

685
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,439
Well, Ricky, it's theft under a thousand,

686
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,445
you know, and...

687
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,947
it'll keep you
from going to jail on me.

688
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,176
I know.
You're right.

689
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,151
And don't worry
about the shed, man.

690
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,119
We'll get it fixed up one day.

691
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,349
Smell him!

692
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,186
He smells like cigarettes.

693
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,193
He does smell like cigarettes
a bit, I guess.

694
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,320
Kitties aren't supposed
to smell like cigarettes.

695
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,591
They're supposed
to smell like kitties.

696
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,030
Aren't ya?

697
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,764
Sorry, Bubbs.
I'm just grumpy, man.

698
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,864
They kept me up all night
fuckin' with me.

699
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,876
You should put a new shirt
on maybe, Ricky.

700
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,444
Excuse me.

701
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,951
Please tell me
that's not Trinity's breakfast.

702
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,454
- That's pathetic.
- Trevor made it. It's fine.

703
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,683
Whatever. You're lucky
Lucy's still asleep.

704
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,454
Don't start shit
with me and Lucy again, please.

705
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,961
I'm not starting shit
with you and Lucy.

706
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,295
- I told you to leave her alone.
- That's not gonna happen.

707
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,390
- Whatever. Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

708
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,798
Remember you are grounded, okay?

709
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,303
So don't leave the park,
all right?

710
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,532
So, Trin, does Mom talk about me at all?

711
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,201
Do you think I got a chance
of getting back with her?

712
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,471
Yeah, if you stop working with Julian.

713
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,410
Are you gonna stop
stealing barbecues

714
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,675
and selling them
at the flea market?

715
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,683
No way!
That gets me money!

716
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,516
Okay, Trin,
what we're doing here is wrong.

717
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,988
The only reason we're doing it
is 'cause you're hungry,

718
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,026
Dad's got no money
and I'm late for work.

719
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,685
<i>Welcome to Danny and Terry's.</i>

720
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,353
<i>- What's popping?
- Yeah, how's it going?</i>

721
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,829
I came through here
two hours ago.

722
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,765
I had a huge order for
a picnic and it's all messed up.

723
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,267
I'm missing, uh,
two cheeseburgers and...

724
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,031
Orange pop and onion rings.

725
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,732
Three or four orange pops,
some onion rings.

726
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,331
I got kids crying
back at this picnic.

727
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,535
Mothers are pissed off at me
and it's your fault.

728
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,168
I gotta get this food fast.
So, please.

729
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,373
I don't want to get the manager
involved, but I will.

730
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,542
<i>I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Please drive through.</i>

731
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,085
Trin.

732
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,820
You gotta quit smoking,
I'm serious.

733
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,486
I was reading
these word papers in jail

734
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,996
and it's really bad for ya.

735
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,862
Come on, we'll both go on
the patch again together.

736
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:23,923
You can do it.

737
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,698
I guess if you'll do it with
me again, I guess I could try.

738
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,500
Hey, that's all I'm asking.

739
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,131
Hand over the cigarettes.

740
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,803
I'm gonna need your lighter
from you, too.

741
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,043
And a couple of bucks for gas,
if you got it.

742
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,813
Awesome.
Thanks, sweetie.

743
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,925
You guys really gotta get
your shit together in there.

744
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,596
Fuck!

745
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,080
Hey, Jim.

746
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,776
Barb.

747
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,340
I have a little question for you.

748
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,387
You wouldn't know
why the lot fees

749
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,514
have been dwindling over
the last two months, would you?

750
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,353
<i>Barb likes to power trip on me</i>

751
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,620
all the time.

752
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,024
We were married once.

753
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,189
She actually, uh, made me
supervisor here at Sunnyvale.

754
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,029
She doesn't like when the lot fees
don't come in on time.

755
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:33,127
She doesn't like that I have
a little problem with alcohol.

756
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,695
And she sure doesn't like Randy.

757
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,401
Can you and Randy handle
taking care of this park,

758
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,341
or should I get somebody
who can?

759
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,639
Barb!

760
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,272
I want the lot fees collected, deposited,

761
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,781
and if somebody
is three months behind

762
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,182
and doesn't pay,
I want them out!

763
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:48,809
Good? Good!

764
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,751
Look, I'm working on it.

765
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,848
Sunnyvale is the most important
thing in my life. You know that.

766
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,359
You sure it's not getting drunk

767
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,225
and walking around the park
with the Hamburglar?

768
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,288
For God's sake, Jim,
get it together!

769
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,156
What time is it, Bubbs?

770
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,250
He's a couple minutes late, Julian.

771
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,887
- He'll be here, though.
- He'll show up.

772
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,591
All right, Cory and Trevor,
do not attract attention.

773
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,192
Hey, Julian.

774
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,405
Well, I can't believe
I fuckin' agreed to this,

775
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,272
but let's go steal
your little bits of change.

776
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,237
No talking!
Get over there!

777
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,145
Julian, you waiting
for more people

778
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,486
to put money in these things
or what? Come on!

779
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,718
Let's do it.

780
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,722
Let's do it.

781
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,120
Julian!
These are the wrong size.

782
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,099
You even check the screwdrivers?
They don't fit!

783
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,831
Would you stop trying
to ruin this for everyone

784
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,099
and concentrate, please?

785
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,939
Completely different mechanism
than what we trained on.

786
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,773
Fuckin' tools are greasy.

787
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,245
Great! Cory, give me
you're fuckin' shirt.

788
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,508
Let's go.

789
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,482
It's a bit of a fuckup here, Julian.

790
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,079
What are we gonna do?

791
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,616
Shut it down.

792
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,427
- Shut it down.
- Shut it down?

793
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,930
Shut it down.

794
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,260
Julian, that's probably a good idea.

795
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,665
We should rethink this,
get some better tools.

796
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,100
All right, we'll get better tools,

797
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,330
come back tomorrow.
No big deal.

798
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,863
I'll show you better tools.
Hold these, Bubbs.

799
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,672
- I'm taking over this job.
- Ricky.

800
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,473
What's he mean,

801
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,014
better tools?

802
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,640
Listen, I said shut it down.

803
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,617
I'm finishing
what you started, Julian -

804
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,483
- stealing change.

805
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,452
Boys, look out!

806
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,295
Everybody, calm down!
Nothing to see here!

807
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,559
Just doing some accident testing
for the city!

808
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,863
Cory, Trevor,
meters in the trunk. Come on!

809
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:18,924
You got it!

810
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,197
Basically, we're just testing

811
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,102
to see the strength
of the metal against cars,

812
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,437
and these two guys are just
gonna load them up now.

813
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,497
Everything went great.

814
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,544
Oh-my-fuck!

815
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,977
Cory, cover your package up!

816
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,447
People are eating
and your bird's out!

817
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,882
If this what you want to do -
steal change with fuck-biscuit

818
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,183
and the naked dummy - go ahead.
I got better things to do.

819
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,555
I'm gonna find the big dirty.
I'm doing it by myself.

820
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,253
Thanks for the shirt, dude.

821
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,056
Any time, man.

822
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,188
Cory, get your ass off my car!

823
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,697
Randy, I want to talk to you
in the office for a minute, boy.

824
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,899
<i>Mr. Lahey, you're breaking up, over.</i>

825
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,434
Randy, I want to talk to you
in the office for a bit, over!

826
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,877
Mr. Lahey, -

827
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,006
- what's up with the abrupt Randy?
- Randy.

828
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,208
- Mr. Lahey!
- Randy.

829
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,751
- Mr. Lahey!
- Randy!

830
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,342
- Fuck...
- Randy!

831
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,920
All we need
is a new receipt logbook

832
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,389
that says Ricky, Julian,

833
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,926
and Bubbles's lot fees
are unpaid.

834
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,461
What are you talking about,
Mr. Lahey?

835
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,996
The guys have paid
their lot fees.

836
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,588
- Randy!
- Where'd all the money go?

837
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,066
Where did your George Foreman
grill come from, Ran?

838
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,070
All I'm saying
is if they want to engage

839
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,766
in a little shit-war,
we're gonna win.

840
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,240
This little technicality
is our secret shit-weapon.

841
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,039
It'll be like a...

842
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,913
...like an intermediate-range
surface-to-air

843
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,008
nuclear-shit-missile.

844
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,278
Hey, Wanda.

845
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,886
Whoa, nice!
Can I drive it?

846
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:48,947
Sure.

847
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,498
Cory and Trevor were supposed
to fix this for me.

848
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,625
Who's Cory and Trevor?

849
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,863
They're my assistants.

850
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,132
- You have assistants?
- Yeah.

851
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,703
Two for "The Dark Canuck."

852
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,715
I have bills.

853
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,914
I've gotta get rid
of this change anyway.

854
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,494
Sorry.

855
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,529
Don't be sorry.

856
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,839
So I hear
you done a little time.

857
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,005
- Who told you that?
- Lucy told me.

858
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,275
Don't listen to her.

859
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,749
I have a little confession to make.

860
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,513
- What?
- I've been in jail, too.

861
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,748
Usually, guys,
I tell them I've been in jail -

862
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,346
- and they get all weird.
- No way.

863
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,723
So now I only date guys
that have been in jail,

864
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,194
'cause those are only ones
who can relate.

865
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,753
Well, I don't wanna brag
or anything,

866
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,799
but I've been in jail
a few times.

867
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,926
Jail's a part of life.
What's the big deal?

868
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,027
- It's not a big deal.
- It's kind of fun.

869
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,036
I think it's fun.

870
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:11,097
Want to see the new bra
I got yesterday?

871
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,204
- That's... Where'd you get that?
- I stole it.

872
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,308
- That's nice fabric.
- Why are you nervous?

873
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,716
I'm not nervous.

874
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,948
- Yeah, you're all boob nervous.
- I'm not boob nervous.

875
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,216
I'm just...

876
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,121
I know there's a man in there.

877
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,319
I'm calling mall security.
You better come out now!

878
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,453
All right, you got us.

879
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,521
What's up?

880
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,825
You guys can't be doing
that in here.

881
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,529
Finish it off, bud.

882
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,038
Do you want popcorn?

883
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,474
I'm gonna get, um,
oh, I'm gettin' nachos,

884
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,138
with cheese and a hotdog,

885
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,307
some chocolate-covered raisins.
Do you like raisins?

886
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,541
Julian?

887
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,483
Hmm? What?

888
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,783
Are you okay?

889
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,915
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about work and stuff.

890
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,752
Ow!

891
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,763
I almost got it, Ricky!
Help me!

892
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,529
Hold it there for a second.
I'll get it.

893
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,967
Not like that!
Jesus Murphy!

894
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,232
Oh, my God!

895
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,402
See?

896
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,908
Ricky!

897
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,138
Julian, we got one open!

898
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,738
Guess what, boys?

899
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,215
I've got some good news.

900
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,809
Ricky, I've been thinking
about the big dirty lately.

901
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,878
You've been thinking
about the big dirty?

902
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,255
And I think I've found it.
I was at the movie theater,

903
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,590
and they've got
this kick-ass coin machine

904
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,322
filled with twonies and loonies.

905
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,227
And check this out:
two hours of the day,

906
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,697
there's only
one person working.

907
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,257
- This is perfect, boys!
- So you stole my idea.

908
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm Mr. Big Dirty,
Julian, not you.

909
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,400
Ricky, it's a combination
of both ideas.

910
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,373
It's still about change
and still untraceable.

911
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,103
What do you say, Bubbs?
You in?

912
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,201
I don't know, Julian.

913
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,644
I mean, would I make enough
to fix up my shed

914
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,477
and get a bit
of cat food going?

915
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,517
You'll have enough cat food
for 10 years.

916
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,881
This is the big-time, boys.

917
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,184
Oh, my God!

918
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,626
Jesus Murphy!

919
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,154
Cocksucker!

920
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,003
Mr. Lahey, not the liquor!

921
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,105
Chill, Randy,
I know what I'm doing.

922
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,171
Bubbles,

923
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,444
what's the plastic for?

924
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,986
I'm trying to fix my roof.
It's leaking.

925
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,282
What's all this, uh,

926
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,118
paraphernalia here?

927
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,748
It's for the "Supercats" cat show.

928
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,690
I do that every year.
You know that.

929
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,422
Where's Ricky and Julian?

930
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,966
None of your business, actually.

931
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,161
When are you expecting
your baby, Randy?

932
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,101
Bubbles,

933
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,139
when your little shit-pals
get back,

934
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,174
here's something
you can tell 'em:

935
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,210
tell them you received
official notice today

936
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,710
that this shit-shack...

937
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,205
...has been
officially condemned...

938
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,478
by the power and authority
invested in me

939
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,247
by the Trailer Park
Supervisors Act.

940
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,881
I am officially condemning
this shed.

941
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,357
What?!
You can't do that, Mr. Lahey!

942
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,792
That's all I have
for me and my kitties!

943
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,295
Shit-clock's ticking, Bubbs,
for you, your shit-rats,

944
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,298
and your shit-turd friends!

945
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,031
Crazy drunk bastard.

946
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,900
What?

947
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,800
Nothin'.

948
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,069
What did you say, Bubbles?

949
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,804
I didn't say anything.

950
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,505
Hope they don't shit on you, Bubbles.

951
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,483
Shit on me? Who?

952
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,452
Shit-hawks.

953
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,818
Big, dirty shit-hawks.

954
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,884
They're coming, Bubbles.

955
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,950
They're flying in low.

956
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,655
They're swooping down,

957
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,027
shitting on people,

958
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,362
and dragging them off
to the big shit-nest.

959
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,091
I'm worried about Lahey, boys.

960
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,996
He's threatened me
and he's back on the liquor

961
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,899
and he's got that crazy look
in his eye again.

962
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,267
He's gonna do something,
I'm telling ya!

963
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,431
Bubbles, Lahey is a drunk
trailer-park supervisor

964
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,338
and Randy's a drunk
cheeseburger eater.

965
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,138
Fuck them!
Just tell them to fuck off!

966
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,074
Well, I do, Ricky,

967
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,443
but it doesn't work
like when you do it.

968
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,540
I just need you to help me
with my shed. Now, come on.

969
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,142
We can't tonight.
We're going to the strip club.

970
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,154
Ricky, maybe I'd like to go
to a strip club too, you know,

971
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,349
and get my drink on
and look at fly hos,

972
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,325
but I can't.
I gotta work on this shit!

973
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,621
Bubbles,
we're not staying there.

974
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,559
We're coming back here.

975
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,494
There's a huge party
at J-Roc's tonight!

976
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,632
I've known J-Roc and Tyrone

977
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,167
since probably
grade six or seven;

978
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,464
we used to be in
the chess club together.

979
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,097
Then they got into like,
heavy-metal music, grunge music,

980
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,141
then they both became MCs.

981
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,800
- Check one, two.
- Three, four, check.

982
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,003
Check, check, T.
J-Roc and T.

983
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,639
And he also makes movies.
I don't know if you knew that,

984
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,307
but he makes grease movies
that he sells

985
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,647
at convenience stores
and gas stations.

986
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,483
Dirty, greasy stuff.

987
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,786
Like you can imagine
what's going on in them.

988
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,291
Dirty stuff.

989
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,864
<i>I can make you scared</i>

990
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,803
<i>If you want me to</i>

991
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,172
<i>I'm not prepared</i>

992
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,112
<i>But if I have to</i>

993
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,444
<i>I said I could make you scared</i>

994
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,848
<i>It's kind of what I do</i>

995
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,487
<i>If you're prepared</i>

996
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,388
<i>- Here's what I propose to do...
- Lucy...</i>

997
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,618
...may I please
have this lap dance?

998
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,993
Phil, honey, can you go get me a drink

999
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,829
and I'll owe you
half a lap dance?

1000
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,664
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1001
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,372
Ricky,
what are you doing here?

1002
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,503
I told you not to come
visit me at work.

1003
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,070
Just wait for me outside,
I'll be out in a second.

1004
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,709
I don't want you to see
this shit. I'm working.

1005
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,218
Lucy, I don't care
about lap dancing.

1006
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,753
It's cool.
You're good at it.

1007
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,255
Remember how it used to be?
When I was growing dope,

1008
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,814
you had your hair salon going.

1009
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:38,123
You used to cook for me
and Trin all the time.

1010
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,184
Remember how perfect that was?

1011
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,594
Well, yeah,

1012
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,393
those were the good old days.

1013
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,559
I needed to come visit you,
'cause...

1014
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,865
I want to talk to you about
something very important later.

1015
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,140
VIP pass right now.
This is the fuckin'

1016
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,336
"Very Important Personnel room."

1017
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:58,006
It's not the "unemployed,
just-got-out-of-jail dumb room."

1018
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,946
Very funny.

1019
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,281
Take it easy.
I got lots of money tonight.

1020
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,650
Yeah? Well, my girlfriend
doesn't give lap dances

1021
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,588
to dirty trailer-park trash.
We clear on that, dick-chops?

1022
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,683
Girlfriend?

1023
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,954
You banged Lucy?

1024
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,053
28 times.

1025
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,395
Lucy, you bang this dick?

1026
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,338
Well, yeah, but, you know,

1027
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,240
you were gone
for, like, 18 months.

1028
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,711
What do you want me to do?
I mean...

1029
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,270
Lucy, I know I was in jail

1030
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,906
and you have needs,
but this idiot?

1031
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,417
I thought about you nonstop
when I was in jail -

1032
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,975
you and Trin.

1033
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,623
I can't believe this.

1034
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,725
I'm sorry.

1035
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,423
Like, I really fucked us up
by going to jail, didn't I?

1036
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,897
Good luck, I guess.

1037
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,435
Get the fuck out of my club!

1038
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,610
What do you need?

1039
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,948
You're lucky I don't want
to go back to jail.

1040
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,348
Ricky's really trying
hard here, Lucy.

1041
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,079
Yeah, he's clearly trying.

1042
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,780
Listen, he was throwing
a party tonight!

1043
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,255
That's what he was
going on about, a party?

1044
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,622
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, I gotta go find him.

1045
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,753
I can't believe you banged
that Sonny guy 28 times!

1046
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,060
- It was 10 or 15 times max!
- Pfft!

1047
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,565
Don't pfft me.

1048
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,603
Fuckin' I gotta go.
I gotta get a cab.

1049
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,904
Do you wanna come
to a party tonight?

1050
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,340
Yes!

1051
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,075
- I have to go change first.
- Okay.

1052
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,780
You can drive my car!

1053
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,649
I just picked it up.

1054
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,514
Hey, man, what's up, dude?

1055
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,082
Yeah!

1056
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,685
Bubbles, what's up, man?

1057
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,061
<i>Yeah how many times
have you sat out the deck</i>

1058
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,963
<i>Gettin' wrecked
and when you collect a check</i>

1059
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,559
<i>Knowin' that's as good as life
is ever gonna get</i>

1060
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,730
<i>Know when you fuck a park
It's in your blood your sweat</i>

1061
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,036
<i>Dat's some doubts and dat's
some bouts of insanity...</i>

1062
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,283
<i>...Stole a diamond ring
to make my girl my wife</i>

1063
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,450
<i>You're a wife wife...</i>

1064
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,585
<i>That's trailer park life</i>

1065
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,165
- So this is where you grew up?
- Yeah, this is home.

1066
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,801
- What do you think?
- It's gorgeous!

1067
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:42,810
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

1068
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,506
For fuck sakes!

1069
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,208
Fuck off with the fireworks!

1070
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,535
<i>This empty space
I've held so long...</i>

1071
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,368
<i>"Ricky,
you're the best captain we ever had.</i>

1072
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,431
<i>Can't wait till you get
arrested again.</i>

1073
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,272
<i>Darren.
Hard as fuck."</i>

1074
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,472
<i>And now I see
the way it's done</i>

1075
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,483
<i>I thought we'd led a life before</i>

1076
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,520
<i>Who we were well I'm not sure</i>

1077
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,386
<i>But one thing I know is right</i>

1078
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,754
<i>I loved you then</i>

1079
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,986
<i>I'm going to love you tonight</i>

1080
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,256
<i>I'm on fire for you baby</i>

1081
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,726
<i>Fire for you woman</i>

1082
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,395
<i>All night</i>

1083
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,304
<i>I'm on fire for you baby</i>

1084
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,740
<i>Fire for you woman</i>

1085
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,210
<i>All night</i>

1086
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:57,019
<i>So don't take your time
it's getting late</i>

1087
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,885
<i>We might lose if we hesitate</i>

1088
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,789
<i>'Cause being free is lots of fun...</i>

1089
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,327
Ricky, I don't love Sonny.

1090
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,887
I don't love him either.
I think he's a fuckin' dick!

1091
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,227
No, I mean...

1092
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,767
<i>I love you.</i>

1093
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,062
Really?

1094
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,400
Yeah.

1095
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,338
Lucy, I know I fucked us up.

1096
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,605
I mean, what kind of boyfriend
can I be in jail?

1097
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,704
I'm sorry. I mean,
it's cool you're banging Sonny.

1098
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,614
I mean, it's no big deal.
It was my fault.

1099
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,881
And it was like
five times, right? Max.

1100
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:33,616
It doesn't matter.
It's totally done.

1101
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,851
It's so good to hear
you say that.

1102
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,621
I really thought
it was 28 times.

1103
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,855
I knew the fucker was lying.

1104
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,958
You want some pizza?
I got some cookin'.

1105
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,900
<i>With all the time spent on trying</i>

1106
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:56,241
<i>Then to lose your loving...</i>

1107
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,151
Smooth.
That's Moroccan Blond hash.

1108
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,350
It's pretty mild, but it's good.

1109
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,051
Do you want to get drunk
with me tonight?

1110
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,825
Hang out here for a bit
and head over to the party?

1111
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,094
Sure.

1112
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,329
How many cigarettes you got, Luce?

1113
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,667
I got a deck.

1114
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,038
Fuck. We're gonna have to get
some cigarettes tonight.

1115
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,771
<i>So come on girl
we'll raise the sky</i>

1116
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,609
<i>We'll break on through
we'll get so high</i>

1117
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,445
<i>And don't worry
about tomorrow's world...</i>

1118
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,231
- Just a sec. Hold on.
- What?

1119
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,638
I'm into something serious
right now, something real heavy.

1120
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,573
There's a chance
I could be going to jail.

1121
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,306
Just thought I'd tell ya
so you don't fall for me, okay?

1122
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,473
Well, what makes you think
I wouldn't wait for you

1123
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:08,074
if you went back to jail, huh?
Jail's no big deal, remember?

1124
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,054
Look at that, Ran.

1125
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,424
Check that out.

1126
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,197
He's got a broken rear window.

1127
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,295
Probably hot.

1128
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,637
Get the license number
and we'll call it in, buddy.

1129
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,236
Right now, it gives me great
pleasure to introduce all y'all

1130
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,178
to the two stars of "Fire Hoes"!

1131
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,648
Give it up, y'all,
for Galaxy and Dazzle.

1132
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,854
And I'm pleased
to announce tonight

1133
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,015
that we in development
on my new film,

1134
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,321
"Spaghetti Hoes."
We also working on "Ida-hoes."

1135
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,020
Know what I'm saying?
And "Cheeri-hoes."

1136
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,359
So look out for all those.
You know what I'm saying?

1137
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,126
You know what I'm saying,
saying, s-saying?

1138
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,168
Hey. T, can I borrow
the microphone for a second?

1139
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,434
How's everybody doin'?

1140
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,701
Whoo!

1141
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,407
Things are finally starting
to come together for me

1142
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,447
and it's all
because of one woman.

1143
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,314
A woman that's been really cool
with me being in and out of jail

1144
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,546
since I was nine years old;
cool with me

1145
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,714
growing dope when
I was in grade seven until now.

1146
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,019
Cool with me smoking dope,

1147
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,684
getting drunk with my friends,

1148
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,352
playing video games
with my friends.

1149
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,362
I mean, I live in a car.

1150
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,297
That's why I want you all here
to see me proposal her.

1151
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,064
Lucy?

1152
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:35,866
I want to ask for your hand
in about marriage.

1153
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,004
What do you say, Lucy?

1154
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,075
Will you marry me?

1155
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,683
Well, there's you know,

1156
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,152
there's a condition, right?
Like...

1157
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,189
you've gotta promise

1158
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,383
you don't go back to jail.
And if...

1159
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,426
you promise that, then...

1160
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,520
all right, then, yeah,
fuck it, I'll marry you.

1161
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,893
I promise that I don't think
I'm ever going back to jail.

1162
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,937
Cheers to Ricky and Lucy.

1163
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:08,993
Show us your tits!

1164
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,664
Show us the tits, Lucy!

1165
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,867
Come on, feature dancer!
You can do it!

1166
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,500
You want to see my tits?!

1167
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:18,013
- Oh, Lucy, what are you doing?
- Uh-oh, don't do it, Lucy.

1168
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,379
Yeah, fuck it, here you go!

1169
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,055
You look great, honey!

1170
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:32,094
- Those are big, Mr. Lahey.
- Unbelievable, Ran.

1171
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,962
What a greasy whore show.

1172
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,624
Hope you're fuckin' happy
with yourself.

1173
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,532
You know, everybody saw
Lucy's tits tonight.

1174
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,194
A couple of people saw 'em, Sarah,

1175
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,364
and everybody loves tits.
What's the big deal?

1176
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,533
That's not the point, Ricky.
It's embarrassing.

1177
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,940
Lucy, I had a great night, okay?
Drink some water.

1178
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,071
I'm gonna sleep in the car
so I don't wake you.

1179
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,808
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to get married.

1180
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,110
Sarah, you got any
rolling papers?

1181
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,049
I think your shirt's
looking good tonight, Ricky.

1182
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,552
Lucy, I'm getting fucked up tonight.

1183
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,747
I'll see you tomorrow around
12:00, 1:00?

1184
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,727
All the kitties are out, Mr. Lahey.

1185
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,160
- Boy, they're cute!
- Randy.

1186
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,357
Mr. Lahey, you're in reverse!

1187
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,663
Gna, gna, gna, gna, gna, gna.

1188
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:22,274
These shit-buckets
will follow my rules, Randy.

1189
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,614
I'd like to order
some orange juice, please.

1190
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,182
Oh, apple juice
would be wonderful.

1191
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,415
What's your friend doing?

1192
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,951
Bubbs, don't you move!

1193
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,863
I've lived in that fucking shed
since I was six years old and...

1194
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,263
and it didn't just fall down
on its own!

1195
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,064
It got smashed down
by a fuckin' drunk shit-hustler!

1196
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,104
Fuckin' shit-twister

1197
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,867
and that big, dirty,
onion-ring bastard, Randy!

1198
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,171
Bubbles!

1199
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,406
- Hand over the nunchucks!
- No way, Julian!

1200
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,277
This is not the way
to deal with this!

1201
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,146
Cory, Trevor, get over here
and give me a hand!

1202
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,448
- Grab his legs!
- Don't grab my legs.

1203
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,578
All right, calm down.

1204
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,418
Calm down, count to 10.
Everything's gonna be cool.

1205
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,755
Trevor?
Let go of my leg!

1206
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,928
Good afternoon, gentleman.

1207
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,160
It is my pleasure
to inform you

1208
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,328
that you have 30 days
to quit the environs

1209
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,961
of Sunnyvale Trailer Park

1210
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,974
for just cause of non-payment
of lot fees.

1211
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,100
- Adios, amigos.
- Give me that.

1212
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,701
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1213
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:38,246
We paid our money.
I live in a fuckin' car, Lahey!

1214
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,906
- Oh, yeah?
- We're not goin' anywhere.

1215
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,109
Keep your hands to yourself.

1216
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,015
No, and the only thing you're evicting

1217
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,213
is the fuckin' cheeseburgers
that are Randy's gut!

1218
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,779
Frig you, Rick.
Yeah? Frig me, Randy?

1219
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,449
- Don't push me!
- You want to fuckin' go?

1220
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,517
'Cause I've been waitin'
to fight you

1221
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,357
for a long fuckin' time!

1222
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,630
Aw! Fuck!
The smell of cheeseburgers!

1223
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,098
Why did you knock
my shed down?!

1224
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,294
Bubbles, that is a dangerous...

1225
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,065
dangerous weapon!

1226
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,800
- You fight dirty, Ricky!
- You like that?

1227
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,808
I'll fucking unload one on ya!

1228
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,640
Fucker. Hey, Lahey!
Guess what?

1229
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,180
<i>Randy's leaking cheeseburger!</i>

1230
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,476
<i>Listen!</i>

1231
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,314
- You fuckin' like that?!
- I don't like it at all, Rick!

1232
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,286
- Bubbles...
- Let's go, Lahey!

1233
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,288
Boys, cops!

1234
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,519
It's a dangerous weapon!

1235
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:28,924
Oh, my fuck!

1236
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,125
That's enough!
Break it up!

1237
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,531
Jim?

1238
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,933
Barb, will you tell
Officer Pineapple-Cock

1239
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,163
and fucky-the-drunk-clown here -

1240
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,729
- we're all paid up!
- Well, I wish I could, Rick,

1241
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,638
but according to Randy's
neatly kept records,

1242
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,176
you're all three months over.

1243
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,644
We paid our lot fees, Barb!
This is bullshit!

1244
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,943
No, it's not.
Look!

1245
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,243
You guys are gone.
Evicted, all of you.

1246
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,254
Well, what about what that
drunk bastard did to my shed?

1247
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,415
Let's talk about drunk
trailer-park supervisors

1248
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,355
getting drunk as fuck,
ruining peoples' lives!

1249
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,984
Maybe I should look into

1250
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,188
how your daughter's
stealing barbecues

1251
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,754
and selling them
at the flea market.

1252
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,959
Eh, Rick?
Would you like that?

1253
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,663
Don't mess with me, Rick.

1254
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,535
Come on, Bubbs.

1255
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,475
Thirty days, boys.

1256
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,569
Thirty sexy days, Julian.

1257
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,439
Sexy.

1258
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,541
- You're gonna pay for this.
- Hey, Rick, knock-knock.

1259
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,211
Who's there?

1260
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,879
A loser, Rick.

1261
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,788
Guess what losers do, Ricky?

1262
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,325
They lose.

1263
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,593
There's no mustard.

1264
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,138
No bologna sandwiches either, Julian.

1265
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,902
Like, what are we going
to do here?

1266
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,374
I mean,

1267
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,502
we paid our lot fees.

1268
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,343
Lahey and Randy told a fib
to Barb and...

1269
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,814
I mean, that's it.

1270
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,511
We're done here, Julian.
There's no hope.

1271
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,350
Wait, wait, wait.
I've got an idea, Bubbs.

1272
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,946
- Bubbs, look at me.
- No.

1273
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,219
- Bubbles, look at me.
- No!

1274
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,021
Look at me, please!

1275
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,892
All we've gotta do

1276
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,024
is the big dirty, today.

1277
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,967
Do you think
that's a good idea, Julian,

1278
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,299
doin' another massive robbery?

1279
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,238
Bubbs, if we do this,
we'll be able to pay the lot fees

1280
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,640
directly to Barb this time.
It's gonna be easy, man!

1281
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,746
All right, Julian.

1282
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,782
Let's do it, then.

1283
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,818
- Let's do the big dirty.
- Hey, Bubbs,

1284
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,617
don't be throwing sandwiches
around the trailer again, man.

1285
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,157
- Come on.
- Sorry, Julian.

1286
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,809
Lahey's right.

1287
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,973
I'm a loser.

1288
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,641
No.

1289
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,152
We're gonna deal with this
Lahey bullshit later, I promise.

1290
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,653
But the big dirty's
happening now

1291
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,485
and we need you, Rick.

1292
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,923
It's a five-man job.

1293
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,859
Come on, you're my wingman.

1294
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,261
A lot of planning
went into this, Ricky.

1295
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,162
I lost my credulence, boys.

1296
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,133
I don't think
I got what it takes.

1297
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,669
I can't do it.

1298
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,194
No offense, guys, but...

1299
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,866
I think I'm as stupid
as you guys are.

1300
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:26,806
No way, Ricky.

1301
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:30,243
You're the coolest guy in the park,
and the smartest.

1302
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,111
Me and Cory have always
looked up to you.

1303
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,742
And if you lose your... credulence,
where does that leave us?

1304
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,616
'Cause without you
it's like we don't have a dad

1305
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,053
or a big brother or somethin'.

1306
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,625
- We love you, Ricky!
- For real, dude.

1307
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,026
Sometimes me and Trevor
pretend we're you.

1308
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,859
Don't go tellin' 'em that.

1309
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,956
Boys...

1310
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,501
you guys pretend you're Ricky?

1311
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,730
Yeah, it's the only time

1312
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,033
we feel cool.

1313
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,571
You guys really pretend
that you're me?

1314
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,874
Yeah.

1315
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,481
Come on, Ricky.

1316
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,249
Come on, Ricky.

1317
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,772
Two for "Freak Turbulence."

1318
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,535
Come on, Bubbles, keep it together.

1319
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,041
This is the big dirty!

1320
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,928
- Ricky's on line.
- Bubble's on line.

1321
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,190
Julian on line.

1322
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,027
- Cory on line.
- Trevor on line.

1323
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,430
Let's do the big dirty!

1324
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,471
All right, you fuckin' idiots!
Clear the fuck out!

1325
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,166
Don't nobody get stupid!

1326
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,300
- What do you want, man?
- No talking!

1327
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,802
Cory, Trevor, confidence check.

1328
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,814
Confidence 100 percent.

1329
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,543
At about 70 percent, Julian.

1330
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,744
Seventy percent?
Trevor, bring it back up to 100!

1331
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,150
Stop fuckin' around here!

1332
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,088
Julian, don't be too hard on 'em.
Cory and Trevor, you guys rock.

1333
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,715
Thanks a lot, Ricky.
I'm at 100 percent.

1334
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,089
Still at 100 percent.

1335
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,929
Bubbles at position two!

1336
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,960
Go time!

1337
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,232
<i>Cory, Trevor, you're doing good.</i>

1338
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,402
<i>You're doing a great job.
Nice work, boys.</i>

1339
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,276
Come on, boys, scoop!

1340
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,819
Scoop like the wind!

1341
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,287
Scoop! Scoop!
Scoop! Scoop! Scoop!

1342
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,119
Ricky, let me help you!

1343
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
Fuck!

1344
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,961
Come on, Trevor,
scoop the fuckin' change!

1345
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,825
Get the fuck off me, Trevor!

1346
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,831
Aah!

1347
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,294
You stupid cock-tractors!

1348
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,462
Oh, no, boys.

1349
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,631
There's people coming out
of the theaters!

1350
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,308
Boys, what are we gonna do?

1351
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,379
No big deal. Just a fire drill.
There's nothing to see here!

1352
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,439
They're real criminals, Dad!

1353
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,178
They're robbing the change.

1354
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,616
What the fuck
happened in there?!

1355
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,020
Come on,
we kind of messed up here.

1356
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,456
It's not the first time,
fuckin' Cory!

1357
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:34,018
- What the fuck was...?
- Get the popcorn bags!

1358
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,394
What the fuck you looking at,

1359
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,490
fuckies?

1360
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,298
- Ricky, we're blocked in!
- The fuck we are!

1361
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,032
- Fuck!
- Darryl!

1362
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,904
Boys, do you guys
think that it might be

1363
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,841
a big deal that 10,000 people

1364
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,709
just saw us doing that
and took pictures of us?

1365
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,180
Maybe?

1366
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:58,710
That is a lot of change
to be in possession of.

1367
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,517
What about all the witnesses,
Ricky?

1368
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,614
Bubbles, the only ones
they saw are Cory and Trevor.

1369
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:03,716
It's no big deal.

1370
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,887
I can't believe it.
We pulled it off.

1371
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,295
We pulled off the big dirty!

1372
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,058
Where are we gonna
hide it all, Julian?

1373
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,898
We'll just leave it
right in the trunk.

1374
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,563
No one's gonna
think to look there.

1375
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,698
Yeah, this seems to be
the safest place.

1376
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,867
You know what you should
do now, Rick?

1377
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,571
You should go spend some time
with your family, buddy.

1378
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,635
You deserve it, man.

1379
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,841
You should make some time
for Trinity, Ricky.

1380
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,884
People are complaining
about her stealing barbecues.

1381
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,579
She's got a new one every day.
That's greasy!

1382
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,019
It's not that greasy.

1383
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:34,681
Boys, come on,
give me a hug here.

1384
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,349
We did it, guys.
We fuckin' did it!

1385
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,086
What did I tell ya?
You steal change,

1386
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,821
you don't go to jail, boys.

1387
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,591
I can't believe it, Julian,
but you were right, man.

1388
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,758
I'll catch you guys later, okay?

1389
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,165
Ricky,

1390
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,703
tell me you're not drinking
liquor out of my cat dish.

1391
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,266
Better fuck off, Bobby!

1392
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,971
You better tell your dad
to pay me for my dope!

1393
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,604
- Hey, Trin.
- Hey.

1394
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,444
- You got your patch on?
- Yup.

1395
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,313
Awesome.
I got some good news.

1396
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,649
- What?
- Me and mom,

1397
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,688
we're getting married.

1398
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:07,814
Wow!

1399
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,448
- Isn't that awesome?
- Yeah.

1400
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,153
We gotta have a little talk,
though, about you stealing barbecues

1401
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,855
and selling them
at that flea market.

1402
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,590
- It's gotta stop.
- No way, Dad.

1403
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,894
It's my money, my living.
It's not gonna happen.

1404
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,959
It has to stop. I'm serious.
I know it's easy and I'm the one

1405
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,006
that taught you to do it,
but you can't need do it anymore.

1406
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,236
'Cause I'm gonna be giving you money
from now on. Look!

1407
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,675
I'll give you this whole thing
if you promise me

1408
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,179
no more stealing barbecues
and you'll stay on that patch.

1409
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,140
Okay,

1410
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,741
but can I at least sell these?

1411
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,116
Oh, yeah, you can sell these, -

1412
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,711
- but don't steal any more.
- Okay.

1413
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,485
And don't tell Mom I gave you
this money, all right?

1414
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,026
- I love you, sweetie.
- Bye.

1415
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,085
I'm gonna spend my big dirty money
on my wedding.

1416
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,688
I'm gonna get a nice ring,
I don't care what it costs.

1417
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:50,993
This is gonna be
the awesomest wedding

1418
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,125
this trailer park
has ever seen.

1419
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,463
The awesomest!
It's all for Lucy.

1420
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,367
Aw, Ricky,
I don't want this wedding

1421
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,702
to get all fucked up.
I want it to be awesome!

1422
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,206
I want lots of music,
awesome food...

1423
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,469
<i>I remember the first night</i>

1424
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,636
<i>me and Lucy made love
just like it was yesterday.</i>

1425
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,372
<i>We were down
at Kentucky Fried Chicken,</i>

1426
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,347
<i>right after those
new chicken strips came out,</i>

1427
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,815
<i>we had a bunch of those,
big bucket of chicken.</i>

1428
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,580
She asked me to come in
the bathroom with her, so I did.

1429
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:14,350
She had booze in her purse;
I had a bunch of good dope

1430
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,856
'cause I was growing dope
back then.

1431
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,520
We just sat there,
smoking dope, drinking.

1432
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,584
<i>We made love all night.</i>

1433
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,688
<i>It was just so beautiful,
I'll never forget it.</i>

1434
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,959
<i>We slept right on the floor,</i>

1435
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,694
<i>till the cleaners came in
the next morning.</i>

1436
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,328
And in the morning,
when we kinda came to,

1437
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:31,567
we just sorta looked at each other
and we knew, like...

1438
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,369
we're gonna be together forever.

1439
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,138
<i>I can't believe
we're getting married.</i>

1440
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,146
Look at that cubic zarcarbium!

1441
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:40,546
And Trin,

1442
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,345
it's because of you
that this all happening.

1443
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,147
I want you to give this
to your mom

1444
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,983
when the guy asks for it
at the wedding.

1445
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,181
Okay.

1446
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,254
Just eat it!
Stop complaining! Mom?!

1447
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,260
Trin, go get the car,
bring it out front.

1448
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,095
I'll be there in a minute.

1449
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,191
What's the matter?

1450
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,860
Check the oil.

1451
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,366
Well, look who -

1452
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,669
- it fuckin' is!
- Who's that?

1453
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,606
Aw, just a jail dummy.

1454
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:08,973
How's the tournament going,
Donny?

1455
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,568
Actually, Rick, uh,
I'm with my family.

1456
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,409
And I don't really want

1457
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,813
to talk to you.
But if you must know,

1458
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,613
your friends are gonna
lose again next week

1459
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,209
and you're not gonna be playing.

1460
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,017
- I'll talk to you later.
- Talk to me later?

1461
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,251
What happened
to "Fight me anytime, anyplace,"

1462
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,121
ya scaredy-cheater?

1463
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,660
Rick, I'm having Chinese food

1464
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,753
with my family, okay?
My wife, my kids,

1465
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,025
my grandmother.
Show a little respect, Ricky.

1466
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,260
Please.

1467
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,097
Okay?
I tell ya what,

1468
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,730
I'm gonna let you
come back to jail.

1469
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,670
You can play
in the tournament, -

1470
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,301
- but this has gotta stop.
- Are you serious?

1471
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,607
- I'm serious.
- You're gonna let me come back?

1472
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,613
I'm getting tired of this.
This is embarrassing.

1473
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,978
You can come back and play.

1474
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,778
This is dumb.
This is getting too much.

1475
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,752
Well, all right, Donny.
That's pretty good of you.

1476
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,913
I know.

1477
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:56,321
You're not playing
in the ball-hockey tournament,

1478
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,518
Ricky.

1479
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:59,959
You're not coming back
just yet to my jail.

1480
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,929
I'll tell you
when you come back.

1481
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,261
Oh, I got you, buddy.
Come on.

1482
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,823
- Come on.
- Dad, great sucker punch.

1483
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,768
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout,
right there. Thanks, kiddo.

1484
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,896
Come on, let's go
before the cops come.

1485
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,804
Let's go,
grab your purse, okay?

1486
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,275
Aw, he got you
pretty good, man.

1487
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:16,311
Fuck.

1488
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,118
God, you were suckered.
Man, he suckered ya!

1489
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,525
Did he ever.

1490
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,965
- Clear!
- Thanks, sweetie.

1491
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,933
Dad, are you all right?

1492
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,027
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just fell off my chair, Trin.

1493
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,664
- Are you drunk, Dad?
- No, I had two drinks today.

1494
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,994
<i>Change, change, change, change.</i>

1495
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,759
I'm so goddamn sick of it.
Parking meters,

1496
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:11,993
vending machines,
laundromats, arcades,

1497
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,534
payphones, pool tables,
carwash.

1498
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,002
People think we give
a shit about change?

1499
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,471
- News flash: we don't.
- George, calm down.

1500
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,337
Mr. Lahey, Randy.

1501
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,403
Hi, I made some sandwiches
here, guys.

1502
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,506
- Got some tuna, egg salad...
- Randy. Ted.

1503
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,847
Jim, you promised me
you'd stop drinking.

1504
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,251
Let's cut to the chase here.
Either of you sexy officers

1505
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,756
interested in grand theft auto?

1506
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,622
- Mr. Lahey, Ted said...
- Randy. Two counts, Ted.

1507
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,128
I got license plates,
serial numbers.

1508
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,528
They're stolen, guaranteed.

1509
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,157
- Jim, we really don't care.
- George.

1510
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,464
- Leave us alone.
- Stop fuckin' calling us!

1511
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,026
George! Enough.

1512
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,436
George, what do you mean
you don't care?

1513
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,975
Mr. Lahey, despite the fact
that you're drunk right now,

1514
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,635
here's what I'm gonna do:

1515
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:57,372
we'll come over
and check out the cars,

1516
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,505
but if they come back clean,
which won't surprise

1517
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:03,381
anybody here, you're not
to contact us in any way

1518
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,182
for at least two months.
No phone calls, no faxes, nothing!

1519
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,553
- We clear?
- Crystal clear, Ted.

1520
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,712
J-Roc, check, check one, two.

1521
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,216
J-Roc, check.
Hey, guys, get drunk!

1522
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,584
This is gonna be awesome!
Everybody, drink up!

1523
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,928
God, Julian looks sexy and nice.

1524
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,062
What are you doing, Jim?

1525
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,902
You promised me
grand theft auto.

1526
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,272
Right here.
Run that!

1527
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,103
Bet you that friggin' car's stolen!

1528
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,081
Get a picture, Randy.

1529
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:05,396
We are gathered here today
to witness the holy matrimony

1530
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,704
of two people,
Richard and Lucy,

1531
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,506
who have chosen to prepare
their own vows.

1532
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:12,342
Thank you, Your Honor.

1533
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,678
Okay, everybody,
here we go!

1534
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,548
I, Richard,

1535
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,611
am gonna cut back on my
drinking to 3 or 4 days a week

1536
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,384
and smokin' dope
to probably 5 or 6.

1537
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,858
And I'm hopefully
promising you this,

1538
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,327
that I'm not gonna hopefully
go back to jail.

1539
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,658
Never.

1540
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,664
I'm gonna try to love you

1541
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,098
as much as I'm capable
for to love, forever and ever.

1542
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,430
And Lucy,

1543
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:37,768
I promise you, I'm gonna start
growing dope again

1544
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,205
and get my life back on track.

1545
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,332
Amen.

1546
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,473
Um, can you hold this for a sec?

1547
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,342
Sweet. Thanks.

1548
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,711
I, Lucy,

1549
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:56,281
promise to stop stripping
so I can open up a hair salon,

1550
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,952
uh, to not get any more

1551
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,517
plastic surgery or tattoos,

1552
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,724
to be a good mother and wife,

1553
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,391
whenever possible,

1554
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,096
and, uh, to help out
with house stuff.

1555
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:13,540
And to help keep Ricky
happy and healthy

1556
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,077
and well...

1557
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,736
taken care of,

1558
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,041
um...

1559
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:22,311
for as long as he stays
out of prison, forever.

1560
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,452
- Do you have the ring?
- Trin?

1561
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,458
Can you just hold that
for a sec?

1562
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,960
I love you, Lucy.

1563
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,295
Oh, my God.

1564
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:43,395
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1565
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,497
You may kiss the bride.

1566
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,413
We did it, Lucy.
We did it!

1567
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,947
Lucy!

1568
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,325
I need to talk to you,
sweetheart.

1569
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,793
What the hell are you doing here?

1570
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:07,851
It's our wedding day!

1571
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,891
I'm not talking to you, smart guy.

1572
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:11,990
I got this Lucy, relax.

1573
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,262
- Let's go home, okay?
- Okay.

1574
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,133
What are you doin'
comin' up here

1575
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,536
on my wedding day
with a big fancy gun?

1576
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,507
I'll tell you
what you're doing:

1577
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,170
- You're showin' off.
- I'm not showin' off.

1578
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,270
Sure, you're showin' off.
Here's showin', here's off,

1579
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,712
there's you.
Look in the word directory -

1580
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,012
- big picture of you showin' off.
- I'm...

1581
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,286
That's showin' off!
That's showin' off!

1582
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,759
Gunfire.
All right, now we gotta move.

1583
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,385
Randy and I'll go 'round back.

1584
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,327
We'll meet you
down at the wedding.

1585
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,865
Lucy, get the fuck over here!
I want my six grand!

1586
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,230
I want the fuckin' money
for the tits, Lucy!

1587
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,966
Six grand for tits?

1588
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,407
Well, I'm not paying

1589
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:55,568
six grand for used tits!

1590
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:59,205
Ricky, they're "in-use" tits.
they're not "used" tits.

1591
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,306
Number one, I found out
you only banged her five times.

1592
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,214
So you were lying about that,
which is showin' off.

1593
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,547
And since you banged her
five times,

1594
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,247
you've used those tits
more than I have.

1595
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,551
I've only banged her twice
since I got out of jail.

1596
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,319
I'm not paying six grand for tits.

1597
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:11,290
I mean, those are nice,

1598
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,385
but I'm not even
a big fan of fake tits.

1599
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,089
So I'm not paying
for used fake tits.

1600
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,393
I liked Lucy just the way she was,
thank you very much.

1601
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,024
Sonny,

1602
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,661
can I talk to you for a second?
Come here.

1603
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,035
- Just give me a second.
- Let me handle this.

1604
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,131
Ricky, we need to talk.
Now! Come on.

1605
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,698
Listen, okay,
I'm really sorry

1606
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,074
that you found out about it
like this, okay?

1607
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,773
We banged a couple of times,
now I'm married.

1608
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,908
Boys, we should get this car
out of here, like now.

1609
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,111
I was gonna make you
a feature dancer.

1610
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:39,744
You could've had it all.

1611
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,221
I don't want to be
a feature dancer.

1612
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,882
- Okay.
- This is what I want.

1613
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,086
So...
can you live with that?

1614
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,595
- We're cool. We're good.
- We're cool? We're good?

1615
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,154
We're good.

1616
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:51,790
Okay, thanks.

1617
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,861
Those are club boots.
I need 'em back, Luce.

1618
01:17:57,806 --> 01:17:59,467
Cops! Cops!

1619
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,047
Ricky, the cops are here...

1620
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,878
I'm starting to lose it maybe.

1621
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,479
Everybody stay
right where they are.

1622
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:17,491
- Jim.
- In cooperation with...

1623
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,049
- Jim.
- ... local police department...

1624
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,391
Mr. Lahey, please!

1625
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,294
Ted, Mr. Lahey's
just trying to help...

1626
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,333
- Randy.
- We'll handle this.

1627
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,470
All right, who fired shots?

1628
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,470
Nobody, huh?

1629
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,214
Cherry Heranjek, right?
Wanted in two states?

1630
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:47,221
There's a Canada-wide warrant
for your arrest?

1631
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,620
- Sound about right?
- What?

1632
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,454
No, I'm Wanda.
I'm a feature dancer.

1633
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,221
- Of course you are.
- I am.

1634
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,059
- You're under arrest.
- No, excuse me.

1635
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,497
- Yes, here's your rights.
- No.

1636
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,695
I'm sorry, Julian.
I guess it's over for a little while.

1637
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,432
I guess I'll see you around
in a couple of years, maybe?

1638
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,269
Jail's no big deal, right?

1639
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,138
- Jail's no big deal.
- Aw.

1640
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,542
I love you, Julian!
Call me!

1641
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,310
Oh, um, Officers,
before we go,

1642
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,044
you might want to check
this guy's pockets

1643
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,882
for, I don't know, a handgun!

1644
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,320
Ha! Ha! Ha! Fucker.

1645
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,556
All right, open it up.

1646
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,528
And that's not yours, right?

1647
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:29,928
It's not mine.

1648
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,489
But we can work this out.
I got all my papers.

1649
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,398
And these aren't my cuffs.
Turn around.

1650
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,061
You're busted.

1651
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,435
Ah, you know what, guys...

1652
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:40,304
- Yeah, yeah.
- We can talk about it downtown.

1653
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,147
Change?

1654
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,813
Oh, he's gonna tell on us!

1655
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,086
We gotta get this car
out of here!

1656
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,527
Okay, hurry.
get the car out of here, okay?

1657
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,461
George! George,
George, George!

1658
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:07,332
They're the ones stealing
the change, George!

1659
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:09,199
They're...

1660
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,739
We'll take the shortcut
and we'll head 'em off.

1661
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,502
Don't you shit-worms move!

1662
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,839
Fuck you, Lahey!
Oh, my God!

1663
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,640
Drunk bastard.
It's okay, boys!

1664
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,179
Come on, Ricky!

1665
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,114
What the hell is he doing?!

1666
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,850
Just go
to the back entrance.

1667
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,585
Ricky,
get us out of here!

1668
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:34,254
You ready for a little game
of shit-chicken, scooter Randy?

1669
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,591
Ricky, the cops are behind us!

1670
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,766
What are we gonna do?!

1671
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,705
Just give me a second
to think about this.

1672
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:49,368
Ricky!

1673
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,178
Do you want to take it
to fucktown, Lahey?

1674
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,514
'Cause that's where this is
headed - downtown fucktown!

1675
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,044
No, Mr. Lahey, please!
We don't want to go to fucktown!

1676
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,432
Guess you lose, fuckhead!

1677
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,629
Ricky!

1678
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,402
Ah, fuck!
Fuck sakes, Rick!

1679
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,351
You okay, Randy?

1680
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,822
Mr. Lahey, we're upside down.
We flipped the car.

1681
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,656
Yeah, that was really something,
wasn't it?

1682
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,987
<i>And so with the able assistance</i>

1683
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,963
<i>of Officers Green and Johnson,</i>

1684
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,933
we solved the crime
and made the arrest.

1685
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,594
Well, thank you, Mr. Lahey.

1686
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,696
You and Randy
may step down now.

1687
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,070
Mrs. Brown.

1688
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,736
Mrs. Brown?!

1689
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,176
Oh, me? Ahem.

1690
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,306
Your Honor,
we ask for leniency

1691
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,680
in the court's decision.

1692
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,151
These boys have no education.

1693
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,211
They're addicted
to drugs and alcohol

1694
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,849
and they live in a trailer park.

1695
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,517
Why the fuck would you say that?

1696
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,458
What the fuck does that
supposed to mean?

1697
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:14,995
I'm warning you,
one more outburst

1698
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,997
and I'll find you
in contempt of court.

1699
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,590
Your Majesty, I'm sorry,
but obviously Miss Brown here

1700
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,727
is a little bit fucked
in the head.

1701
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,998
I mean, she's looking
at these coupons for...

1702
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,505
"Danny and Terry's
Buffalo Heaven"

1703
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,768
trying to figure out
what she wants for lunch.

1704
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,036
What the hell is that?

1705
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,577
She doesn't care about us.

1706
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,340
If this suit-dummy here
doesn't mind,

1707
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,974
I'd like to have two minutes
of the court's time

1708
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,984
to say a couple things.
Just two minutes. Please.

1709
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:39,486
Your Honor, we can't waste
the court's time with this.

1710
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,317
- Two minutes, that's it!
- Your Honor!

1711
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,856
I'm... I'm gonna grant it.

1712
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,824
I mean, what harm can it do,
Mr. Stevenson?

1713
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,417
You've got this thing sewn up,

1714
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:47,984
right?

1715
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,554
- You go ahead, Ricky.
- Thanks, bud.

1716
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:55,460
The first thing is this -
this stupid picture.

1717
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,506
If I could get Cory and Trevor
to rise there for a second.

1718
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,444
I mean, obviously,
well, you can see

1719
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,479
that that's Cory
and this is Trevor.

1720
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,777
I don't know who that guy is,
you can't see him,

1721
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,248
and you can't see
that person either.

1722
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,875
So there's only two people
in the picture.

1723
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,385
It looks like maybe
they are stealing change,

1724
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,512
which I don't agree with,

1725
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,021
but I had nothing
to do with this.

1726
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,921
This is not the change
they recovered from my car.

1727
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,687
Totally different.
That's the change I was saving

1728
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,193
for my daughter's education.

1729
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,523
So the second thing...

1730
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,564
is this:

1731
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,099
really, the only evidence against us

1732
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,727
is Mr. Lahey's testimony.

1733
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,430
And if his testimony
is so goddamn important,

1734
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,564
then I want to hook him up
to a breathalyzer.

1735
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,200
He should clearly show
he's not drunk as fuck,

1736
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,538
'cause I think he is.

1737
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:39,409
And if he is, shouldn't
his testimony mean fuck all?

1738
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,813
Shouldn't this case
be thrown out of court?

1739
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,282
Shouldn't I be given
my change back?

1740
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,648
I'm in deservement
of the change.

1741
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,085
I want the change back!

1742
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,554
It's not my fault

1743
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:51,421
Officers Cock-Knuckles and
Dick-Lock here work with a drunk

1744
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,984
trailer-park supervisor.
He's not a cop, he's a drunk!

1745
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,394
They are not Officers
Cock-Knuckles and Dick-Lock.

1746
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,988
They are Officers
Green and Johnson.

1747
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,398
Now I warned you
about this kind of thing!

1748
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,333
He used to be a cop, actually,

1749
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:03,962
and he got fired.
Guess what for?

1750
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,405
Drinking!
Who does he work with?

1751
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,840
Randy, who used to be
a male prostitute.

1752
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,275
You got no problem with being

1753
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,575
hooked up with a breathalyzer,
do you, Lahey?

1754
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,979
I mean, you shouldn't be drunk.
You drove here today.

1755
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,109
Oh, smart, Ricky, smart.

1756
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,312
Bailiff, do we have
a breathalyzer machine -

1757
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,820
- in the building?
- Yes.

1758
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,117
Well, let's get it in here

1759
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,987
and find out who's drunk
and who's not!

1760
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,603
Come on, come on.

1761
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,535
Come on, liquor!
Come on, liquor!

1762
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,766
Come on, you're drunk.

1763
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,275
You gotta be drunk.
You're always drunk, you drunk.

1764
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:45,039
Come on, you're drunk.
You've got to be drunk.

1765
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:49,047
The witness is intoxicated,
Your Honor.

1766
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,017
I knew he was wasted!

1767
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,020
I knew it.
He's loaded!

1768
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,953
Well, in light
of this new evidence,

1769
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,514
I have no choice
but to drop the charges

1770
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,719
against Ricky, Julian

1771
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,557
and Bubbles.

1772
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:05,292
Order, please!
And because there's no proof

1773
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:08,028
that the money came
from an illegal source,

1774
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,470
I order that their change
be given back to them.

1775
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,133
Thank you.
It is my change. Thank you.

1776
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,803
Cory and Trevor, please rise.

1777
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:19,745
I sentence you
to 30 days in jail

1778
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:21,645
and 750 hours

1779
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:22,978
of community service.

1780
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,485
That's not that bad, guys.
That's pretty good.

1781
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,247
Hear that, Lahey?

1782
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,380
You never stopped
fuckin' with me, huh?

1783
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,981
You couldn't let it go
and look what happened?

1784
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:33,220
You look like a dick.
Rick, get it together.

1785
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,990
Do you want to spend a week
in jail effective immediately?

1786
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,057
Did you say a week?

1787
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,533
Would you rather have two?

1788
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,162
No, no, a week's good.
Just...

1789
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:47,431
Lucy, Trin, can I please
go to jail for a week,

1790
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:50,569
play in the hockey game?
Please? It's only a week.

1791
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:52,135
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

1792
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,680
Really?

1793
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,443
Cover your ears, sweetie.

1794
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,008
Fuck this court.
Fuck Jim Lahey. Fuck Randy.

1795
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,917
Fuck those two idiot cops.
Fuck suit-dummies.

1796
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,751
As a matter of fact,
fuck legal aid!

1797
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,949
Fuck Dan and Terry's

1798
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,288
Buffalo chicken wings!
Fuck all the old wood in here,

1799
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,554
the moon,
corn on the cob,

1800
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:09,597
squirrels.
Fuck me, you, everything!

1801
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,797
Give it off to Darren!
Come on, Darren!

1802
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,461
It was just so great
to come back

1803
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:18,335
to play in the final game
of the tournament.

1804
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,874
I missed lots of games,
but I played in the big one.

1805
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:24,343
If you see 'em, feed 'em, boys.
We gotta score the winning goal.

1806
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,471
Hard as fuck, boys.
Hard as fuck!

1807
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,880
Don't take any shit
off these dicks.

1808
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,781
It wasn't looking good
for them...

1809
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,753
And we're huge Ricky fans
and he's an incredible goalie,

1810
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,982
and, you know, he can stop
just about anything,

1811
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,958
but the team wasn't playing
as a team.

1812
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,619
They weren't playing good.

1813
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,925
The turning point, for me,
was when Donny came down

1814
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:46,455
on a breakaway and I was sure
they were gonna win.

1815
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:47,967
And Ricky just threw the glove up

1816
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,231
and stopped it.
And then, somehow, it started

1817
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:51,932
going the other way,
and Darren,

1818
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,496
on a breakaway,
faked a slapshot,

1819
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,600
just went around him,
deeked it right in,

1820
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:58,237
and they won!

1821
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:02,776
It was insane, dude.
And in all the hoopla, we were,

1822
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,081
like, this is our big chance
to make something of ourselves.

1823
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:08,122
But the best part
was Cory and Trevor.

1824
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,555
They snuck up behind Donny -
he wasn't looking -

1825
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,321
and they pantsed him
in front of the whole prison.

1826
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,861
Rolling around on the ground

1827
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:16,920
in puddles.
Oh, my God, it was funny.

1828
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,488
Those guys finally came out
of their shell

1829
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,056
and they're cool,

1830
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,864
like everybody in here
loves them now.

1831
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,734
So I get to leave here
a married man.

1832
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:27,001
And I'm retired,
so all I have to do now

1833
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,872
is spend time with my family
and grow dope.

1834
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:30,376
My life couldn't be any better.

1835
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,008
<i>I left your house this morning</i>

1836
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:39,017
<i>About a quarter after nine</i>

1837
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,916
<i>Coulda been the Willie Nelson</i>

1838
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:50,492
<i>Coulda been the wine</i>

1839
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:57,371
<i>When I left your house
this morning</i>

1840
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:01,841
<i>It was a little after nine</i>

1841
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:05,140
<i>It was in Bobcaygeon</i>

1842
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,078
<i>I saw the constellations</i>

1843
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:09,378
<i>Reveal themselves</i>

1844
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,078
<i>One star at a time</i>

1845
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:30,331
<i>Drove back to town this morning</i>

1846
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,998
<i>With working on my mind</i>

1847
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:42,379
<i>I thought of maybe quitting</i>

1848
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:48,182
<i>Thought of leaving it behind</i>

1849
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,251
<i>Went back to bed this morning</i>

1850
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,456
<i>And as I'm pulling down the blind</i>

1851
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,967
<i>Yeah the sky was dull</i>

1852
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,737
<i>And hypothetical</i>

1853
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:09,539
<i>And falling one cloud at a time</i>

1854
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:12,443
<i>That night in Toronto</i>

1855
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:16,210
<i>With its checkerboard floors</i>

1856
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,377
<i>Riding on horseback</i>

1857
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:20,785
<i>And keeping order restored</i>

1858
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,755
<i>Till the men they couldn't hang</i>

1859
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:26,225
<i>Stepped to the mic and sang</i>

1860
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:28,592
<i>And their voices rang</i>

1861
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:32,759
<i>With that Aryan twang</i>

1862
01:29:56,691 --> 01:30:00,627
<i>I got to your house this morning</i>

1863
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:05,457
<i>Just a little after nine</i>

1864
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:11,797
<i>In the middle of that riot</i>

1865
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,136
<i>Couldn't get you off my mind</i>

1866
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:24,482
<i>So I'm at your house this morning</i>

1867
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:27,646
<i>Just a little after nine</i>

1868
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:30,816
<i>'Cause it was in Bobcaygeon</i>

1869
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,986
<i>Where I saw the constellations</i>

1870
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,790
<i>Reveal themselves</i>

1871
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:40,323
<i>One star at a time</i>
