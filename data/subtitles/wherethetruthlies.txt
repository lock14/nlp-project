1
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,136
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>...from the beautiful
Carlou Theater...</i>

3
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,171
<i>...in the heart of sunny
Miami Beach, Florida...</i>

4
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,312
<i>...it's the Veterans Day
Polio Telethon!</i>

5
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,039
<i>And now, please
welcome your hosts...</i>

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,413
<i>...the beautiful, the talented,
Lanny Morris...</i>

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,555
<i>...and Vince Collins!</i>

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,877
Do you realize
we have to present ourselves...

9
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,638
...in front of these lovely
people for the next three days?

10
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,145
Hello, lovely people
for the next three days.

11
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,214
-Look at you. You're a disgrace.
-What?

12
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,047
Look, your hair's a mess, your shoes
aren't shined, your shirt's not pressed.

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,282
-Look at your tie. It's not even straight.
-Look at yours. It doesn't even clip on.

14
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,959
Now...

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,888
...I'm upset.

16
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,791
You know what
happens when I get upset.

17
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,595
No, no, no. Please.
Please don't hurt me, Vince.

18
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,001
I've had a terrible day already.
All sorts of bad things have happened.

19
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,436
I don't wanna be hurt again.

20
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,167
-You've been hurt already, have you?
-Been hurt real bad.

21
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,572
And what happened,
pray tell?

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,613
-Want me to pray or want me to tell?
-I think you better pray.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,510
<i>-I saw this stranger
-I don't know whether you're...</i>

24
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,914
<i>-... singing or speaking.
-Leave my pad</i>

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,649
<i>-One thing I do know...
-And I said, "Baby...</i>

26
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,885
<i>-... what explanation do you have?"
-There's always a woman involved.</i>

27
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,461
<i>And she said:</i>

28
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,461
<i>-Next time?
-Next time</i>

29
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,930
<i>And I said, "There will be
No next time"</i>

30
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,230
That's what you said last time,
Lanny, and the time before that.

31
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,700
You have to make sure there's no first
time, then there can't be a next time.

32
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,309
Or a last time.

33
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,245
<i>-That was the last time for me
-Let's hope so, Lanny.</i>

34
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,316
Lanny Morris,
ladies and gentlemen.

35
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,256
My manager sent me over
some of your work.

36
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,758
It's funny how you're
really in them a lot.

37
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,753
Whenever I read these
interviews where the writer says:

38
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,956
"This is how I felt the morning
I woke up to meet the pope"...

39
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,965
..."how I felt when the pope greeted
me, how he reminded me...

40
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,569
...so much of my friend Mike"...

41
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,433
...I always think,
"Who the fuck is Mike?"

42
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,903
So who are you?

43
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,975
<i>I was a young journalist...</i>

44
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,614
<i>...with a few awards...</i>

45
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,943
<i>...a couple of cover stories...</i>

46
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,121
<i>...and a desperate need
to prove myself.</i>

47
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,293
If you look through my work,
you'll see I try to present...

48
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,258
...a balanced view of my subjects.

49
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,398
I leave the conclusions
to the reader.

50
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,896
I'm not sure we like balance.

51
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,898
Or leaving
the conclusions to the reader.

52
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,968
I'm used to being publicized,
not analyzed.

53
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,604
It would be your words.

54
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,138
We'd publish it as a transcript:

55
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,936
My questions, your answers.

56
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,804
If you say it, I can use it.

57
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,347
If you don't, I can't.

58
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,450
And they're gonna pay me
a million for this?

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,019
An excerpt will be published
in a magazine as a way...

60
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,589
...of amortizing the investment
they'll be making in the book.

61
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,487
They're looking for some...

62
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,629
...provocative stories
for the first issue.

63
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:04,098
Any thoughts on what these
provocative stories might be about?

64
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,799
The breakup.
Why Lanny and you split.

65
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,004
And the girl.

66
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,042
Maureen.

67
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,549
What happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.

68
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,221
<i>No one had ever been able
to pin Lanny Morris...</i>

69
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,827
<i>...or Vince Collins
to the girl's death.</i>

70
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,724
<i>All that was clear...</i>

71
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,560
<i>...was that Maureen was
found dead in their hotel suite.</i>

72
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,702
<i>It was unthinkable to me
that Lanny and Vince...</i>

73
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,773
<i>...could have had
anything to do with it.</i>

74
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,909
<i>They were my heroes.</i>

75
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,544
"The reason I consider
myself to be a miracle girl...

76
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,579
...is because
I had the good fortune...

77
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,377
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick.

78
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,250
Their love of life
is what gave me hope...

79
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,949
...and it's hope
that gives us the power to live. "

80
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,795
Thank you, Lanny.

81
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,930
Thank you, Vince.

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,512
Come on, let's hear it for her.

83
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,049
<i>Denise handled publicity
for the polio foundation.</i>

84
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,620
<i>And it was her idea to plug
the girl's story on the telethon.</i>

85
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:35,851
<i>The day before, it was my idea to plug
Denise at the Miami Versailles Hotel.</i>

86
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,362
Don't stop! Don't stop!

87
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,732
Don't stop!

88
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,342
<i>You can tell a lot about a woman
by the way she acts...</i>

89
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,147
<i>...when you're having sex
and room service comes in.</i>

90
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,415
<i>Some girls will sit up
and light a cigarette...</i>

91
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,493
<i>...like there's nothing funny
in the world about her being naked.</i>

92
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,027
<i>"It's obvious we were
in the process of screwing...</i>

93
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,165
<i>...so why not let
a stranger into the room?"</i>

94
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,629
Come on in.

95
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,303
<i>Then there's the kind that will
pull the sheets up...</i>

96
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,062
<i>...and act like they're asleep.</i>

97
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,264
Where would you like it, sir?

98
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,238
Sweetheart, wherever you'd like it.

99
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,072
<i>Then, of course, there's
the ones who scrunch real flat...</i>

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,181
<i>...thinking that the bed
will look empty.</i>

101
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,944
<i>With Denise, it was kind of hard
to tell which way she'd go.</i>

102
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,456
Can I have your autograph,
Mr. Morris?

103
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,328
Sure.

104
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,558
Should I make it out to Maureen?

105
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,931
I mean, your autograph on the bill.

106
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,076
Okay.

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,043
I mean, I'd love
to have your autograph.

108
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,880
And maybe a few minutes
of your time.

109
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,917
I'm a huge fan and...

110
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,349
...well, I was thinking about...

111
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,619
...writing an article on you
for my campus paper.

112
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,262
I'm the editor.

113
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,661
Any interview requests
go through me, honey.

114
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,799
You know, it's just a college paper.

115
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,009
Thank you.

116
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,512
No, thank you.

117
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,285
Thank you, Maureen.

118
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,222
<i>I say goodbye to Maureen,
knowing I'd see her again...</i>

119
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,692
<i>...close the door and
then turn to look at Denise...</i>

120
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,857
<i>...thinking, "I know this girl from every
college town we have ever played. "</i>

121
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,467
<i>They're called career girls.</i>

122
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,934
<i>The absolute easiest lays...</i>

123
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,903
<i>...in this great nation of ours.</i>

124
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,936
<i>Since you're reading this,
you'd be interested to know...</i>

125
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,412
<i>...that my favorite catches
were the intellectuals.</i>

126
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,747
<i>They'd be the ones in the straight
black dresses, severe black hair.</i>

127
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,187
<i>Your basic neurotic,
eyeglasses, cool jazz, liberal...</i>

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,055
<i>..."I'll fuck any black guy as
part of my personal apology...</i>

129
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,526
<i>...for racism in America" type.</i>

130
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,127
<i>Anyhow, on this particular night,
we're in a club in New Jersey...</i>

131
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,863
<i>...it's the '50s, and I'm mingling
with the crowd.</i>

132
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,398
<i>Now, when I say "mingling, "
what I mean is...</i>

133
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,634
<i>...I was scouting
for who I would sleep with.</i>

134
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,937
<i>Didn't matter if the girls
came with dates.</i>

135
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,412
<i>That was Reuben's job.
Reuben is my valet.</i>

136
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,415
<i>I never figured out how he
helped them get rid of their dates...</i>

137
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,986
<i>...but they were always gone
by the second show.</i>

138
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,282
<i>Reuben could clean up
any situation.</i>

139
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,391
Excuse me, miss.
May I say that I think...

140
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,757
...you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

141
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,422
Notice I say, "I think you've got the
most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. "

142
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,296
I haven't seen them yet.
I've been staring at your cans.

143
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,765
Now, Lanny.

144
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,741
-I can't believe he just said that.
-That is completely unacceptable.

145
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,376
Madam, I apologize.
I apologize, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,308
...for my friend. You cannot
speak that way to a stranger.

147
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,840
Look, her husband's not offended.

148
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,984
-He's not?
-No, her husband's not offended.

149
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,711
Her husband's not here.
This lucky guy is her boyfriend.

150
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,322
And even he's not offended,
and do you know why?

151
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,355
Well, I can certainly hazard a guess.

152
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,427
What the hell is that? For chrissake,
Vince, this is America.

153
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,191
We don't say, "hazard a guess. "
We say "yes" or we say "no. "

154
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,061
Well, I say "no" to you, Morris.

155
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,758
Excuse me?
Could you repeat that?

156
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,200
I don't think
the entire audience heard you.

157
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,874
Go back to where
you came from, bastard!

158
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,908
<i>I get hecklers all the time,
but this schmuck came off personal.</i>

159
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,443
<i>Where did he think I came from?</i>

160
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,774
Bastard! Bastard!
He called me a bastard.

161
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,882
Now, it doesn't show
from the front, Lanny.

162
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,611
Now, please, would you kindly not
mount me? It's very disagreeable.

163
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,085
<i>Vince plunges straight into
quoting lines I wrote...</i>

164
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,281
<i>...from a song
from our first motion picture.</i>

165
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,394
<i>I happen to be honored
to work with this jerk</i>

166
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,563
Is that a compliment?

167
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,322
<i>I never frown with this clown</i>

168
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,499
Never, never, never.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,962
<i>I get a kick from this...</i>

170
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,196
<i>...friend of mine</i>

171
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,864
Fine, but don't give
the mike to this kike.

172
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,408
-Well...
-Just relax.

173
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,714
It's not often we get topped by
a member of our audience, but...

174
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,751
...this gentleman has
done the impossible.

175
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,684
What is your name?

176
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,315
-It's Joe.
-Joe...

177
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,758
...we were just wondering
if you'd be a great sport...

178
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,227
...and help us out on stage.
What do you say, folks?

179
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,063
Go on.

180
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,331
Joe here is going to play
a crazy high school professor...

181
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,944
...who's about to give Lanny
and I our final high school exam.

182
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:57,013
So if you'll just excuse us while
we help Joe change into his...

183
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,478
...crazy-professor outfit.

184
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,777
Lanny, a little
costume-changing music...

185
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,920
...if you please.

186
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,594
Step this way.

187
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,800
I'll have a word with him...

188
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,800
...about the way
he spoke to your wife.

189
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,563
Completely unnecessary.

190
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,435
Just this way.

191
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,691
You call any Jew on this planet
anything you like.

192
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:48,560
But nobody calls my partner a kike.
Do you understand?

193
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,917
<i>Boffing ladies and
bashing gentlemen.</i>

194
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,714
<i>I tell you, there was
nothing under the sun...</i>

195
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,653
<i>...Vince and I wouldn't do
for each other.</i>

196
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,754
Are you finished?

197
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,706
Thank you, Mamie.

198
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,841
I'm sorry about that, Miss O'Connor.

199
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,242
We just needed to be sure
you didn't take any notes.

200
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,576
Lanny gave me very specific
instructions on that point.

201
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,186
I don't understand why
he'd want me to read this.

202
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,289
Why would he ever want
anyone to see this side of him?

203
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,154
When you contacted us about
meeting Lanny for your book...

204
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,161
...it wasn't simply about letting you
know he didn't want to speak with you.

205
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,827
I believe my client wanted you
to understand that he, in fact...

206
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,504
...was completing a book
of his own which would serve...

207
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,570
...not only as his autobiography...

208
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,710
...but also as the definitive account of
the joint careers of Morris and Collins.

209
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,847
You've had, at first hand,
a sample of Lanny's writing voice.

210
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,215
Yes, I have.

211
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,181
Such a book, Miss O'Connor...

212
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,877
...this raw, this honest...

213
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,216
...would make your own efforts look-

214
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,790
There's been some very nice...

215
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,484
...translations of the Bible
over the centuries...

216
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,597
...but they would run
a very poor second in popularity...

217
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,565
...to the discovery
of the actual Ten Commandments.

218
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,233
Single best part about teaching
grade two is the difference...

219
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,204
...between the bright ones and
the dumb ones isn't so obvious.

220
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,809
-What's so great about that?
-The results of my work...

221
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,570
...as a teacher
aren't so depressing.

222
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,443
Also, there's no homework
to correct in the evenings and...

223
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,211
...well, none of the kids
know how to use drugs.

224
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,426
<i>Bonnie had come from New York
to visit me that summer.</i>

225
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,190
<i>We'd been best friends
since kindergarten.</i>

226
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,301
<i>At school we started the
Lanny and Vince Fan Club...</i>

227
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:07,734
<i>...raising almost $200
for that year's telethon.</i>

228
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,805
All of you send in
a bit of your allowance.

229
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,137
Just a little bit.
A dime, a nickel, a penny.

230
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,870
Every bit helps.

231
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,943
<i>The goal of the telethon that year...</i>

232
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,451
<i>...was $3.9 million, which was
a lot of dough at that time.</i>

233
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,422
Thank you, Tom.
You're a prince among men.

234
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,117
Whoa, Lanny. There are
children watching!

235
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,819
Where does he get his energy?

236
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,798
<i>To remind viewers of the goal...</i>

237
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,095
<i>...we agreed the telethon
could run 39 hours nonstop.</i>

238
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,267
<i>The show would begin at 9 p. m. on
Friday and finish at noon on Sunday.</i>

239
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,807
<i>We paced it so that
Vince and I were together...</i>

240
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,104
<i>...for the kickoff,
most of the day Saturday...</i>

241
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,806
<i>...then the big finale
on Sunday with us bleary-eyed...</i>

242
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,952
<i>...and weeping as America
got ready to go to church.</i>

243
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,521
Lanny, Lanny. What are you doing?

244
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,090
I'm ordering a pizza. I'm starving.

245
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,024
No anchovies on mine, Lanny.
Hey, so who are you talking to?

246
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,393
I'm talking to little Suzie
from Whittier, California...

247
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,092
...and she is going to donate
three weeks of allowance.

248
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,467
-How about that, folks?
-Suzie from Whittier, thank you.

249
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,164
Three weeks of allowance.

250
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,775
That's a challenge for all you-

251
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,208
<i>What you have to understand
is that Vince and me...</i>

252
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,574
<i>...were essentially a boy-girl act.</i>

253
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,342
<i>I was the tramp,
ready for any sort of action...</i>

254
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,143
<i>...and Vince was the gentleman...</i>

255
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,481
<i>...always trying to make me
behave myself.</i>

256
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,180
<i>I was pleasure, and he was control.</i>

257
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,585
<i>I was rock 'n' roll,
and he was class.</i>

258
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:41,129
<i>His presence gave America
permission to like me.</i>

259
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,595
<i>My deal with the publisher
gave me first-class travel...</i>

260
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,329
<i>...a luxury I'd never enjoyed.</i>

261
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,940
Is there any chance of switching
to a window seat?

262
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,407
Sorry, we're completely booked
in first.

263
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,581
But these center seats
are really wonderful. See...

264
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,909
...if you push here-
Can I show you?

265
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,847
Sure.

266
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,182
The chair swivels
to the left and the right.

267
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,689
And this converts
to a full-sized dining table...

268
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,656
...during our
Pan Am platinum service...

269
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,422
...with damask linen
and silverware by Fornari...

270
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,861
...so you don't have to eat off a tray.

271
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,729
Again, that's only
for these center seats.

272
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,001
How does that sound?

273
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,000
<i>At that time, when you
traveled first class...</i>

274
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,304
<i>...people would always ask you if you
met someone famous on the flight.</i>

275
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,447
-Mr. Morris.
-Thank you.

276
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,808
You're welcome.

277
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,726
<i>Though he would later accuse me
of engineering this, I didn't.</i>

278
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,295
<i>It just...</i>

279
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,193
<i>...happened.</i>

280
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,566
Reuben. So they-
They record these songs...

281
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,505
...in a studio that I am paying for.

282
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,542
Songs that are recorded for me...

283
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,442
...that they are
contracted to provide.

284
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,617
-Are you with me here?
-Yes, it's just that-

285
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,015
No, it's just that nothing, Irv.
Please, let me finish. They record...

286
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,657
<i>I read an interview where Lanny was
given credit for insisting his butler...</i>

287
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,726
<i>...travel in the same class and stay
at the same hotels as his boss.</i>

288
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,730
<i>The valet's attentiveness
was impressive.</i>

289
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,033
Looks like you'll be having
dinner with Lanny Morris.

290
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,837
-Hello.
-Hi.

291
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,951
We should get a waiter to slide
a matchbook under the airplane.

292
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,682
There we go.

293
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,587
That should hold.

294
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,323
This is my friend Reuben.

295
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,758
-Hi.
-Hi.

296
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,525
And this is also my friend,
technically speaking...

297
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,702
-... and business manager, Irv.
-Hi.

298
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,202
My name is Lanny.

299
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,502
And what's your name?

300
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,142
Bonnie. Bonnie Trout.

301
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,681
What do you do, Bonnie?

302
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,452
I teach.

303
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,280
And what do you teach?

304
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,718
-Second grade.
-Well, we have a lot in common.

305
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,415
You teach second grade,
I went to second grade.

306
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,790
-Irv, you went to second grade too?
-Many times.

307
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,464
Tell me, Miss Trout-

308
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,098
I don't mean to be impolite...

309
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,858
...but I was wondering...

310
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,629
...how a second-grade schoolteacher
affords to fly first class.

311
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,969
Well, I have a pass...

312
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,635
...that allows me free use
of the subway on weekends...

313
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,010
...and the hot lunches
at school are only 50 cents.

314
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,852
And I'm the mistress...

315
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,521
...of a wealthy married man...

316
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,350
...and when he and his wife
go on vacation, he treats me...

317
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,722
...to a first-class trip
in the opposite direction.

318
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:02,000
But look at me, talking only about
myself. What do you do for a living?

319
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,859
I'm a French impressionist
painter out of Tahiti, mainly.

320
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,505
I'm doing that to pay the bills.
My ambition is to be...

321
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,766
...a stockbroker in Paris.

322
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,703
-I don't get it.
-Paul Gauguin.

323
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,879
He gave up being
a successful stockbroker...

324
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,514
...to become a painter
in the South Seas.

325
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,382
You think the average
person knows that?

326
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,953
Well, we're not talking about
the average person, Irv.

327
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,559
<i>In some ways...</i>

328
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,957
<i>...he had never stopped
being a hero to me.</i>

329
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,928
<i>That's why it was impossible
to think he might also be a killer.</i>

330
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,200
Well, this has been great.

331
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,537
I'm gonna see you
inside your apartment.

332
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,214
-There's really no need.
-Don't be silly.

333
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,246
I'm not gonna try to come in.

334
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,975
Promise.

335
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,347
You've been away from your
apartment for how long now?

336
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,217
-Ages.
-You never know if somebody's...

337
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,016
...broken in while you were gone.

338
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,888
I'll just see you inside your door.

339
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,463
Believe me, I'm-
I'm not trying to seduce you.

340
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,634
<i>I have to do the Today show
at 7 a. m.</i>

341
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,235
They want me in Makeup at 6:15.

342
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,701
<i>Bonnie had moved to New York
for the teaching job...</i>

343
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,874
<i>...a little over a year ago.</i>

344
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:21,102
<i>I had never visited her and had
no idea if this was the right place.</i>

345
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,814
Which floor?

346
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,281
Why...

347
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,647
-Four-D.
-Forty?

348
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,052
It only goes up to six.

349
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,116
Four-D-

350
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,557
Four-D, the fourth floor.

351
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,883
Which way?

352
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,685
-Guess.
-Why?

353
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,152
It's a test.

354
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,882
A test?

355
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,253
Okay.

356
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,862
This way.

357
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,731
So why didn't we take this elevator?

358
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,564
Doesn't work.

359
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,242
Well...

360
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,476
...good night.

361
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,647
No, I'm going to see you
into your apartment.

362
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,373
And then I'm gonna leave you
alone until tomorrow.

363
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,499
I never get which key goes in
which lock the first time.

364
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,338
Hey, looks like they fixed it.

365
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,187
You okay?

366
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,789
Maybe we should turn on a light.

367
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,869
Well...

368
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,598
I'm going to leave you now.

369
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,142
I have Reuben and Irv waiting
in the limousine downstairs...

370
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,548
<i>...and I should get some sleep
for the Today show.</i>

371
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,218
So...

372
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,221
It was lovely to meet you, Bonnie.

373
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,944
<i>By the end of the telethon,
we had no voices.</i>

374
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,743
<i>Thirty-nine hours
of nonstop entertainment.</i>

375
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,785
<i>A telethon was a superhuman feat.</i>

376
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,446
<i>We weren't just heroes,
we were gods.</i>

377
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,059
<i>A couple of the boys were there
to make sure we got out alive...</i>

378
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,596
<i>...to make the flight to New York.</i>

379
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,406
Everyone. Listen. Listen.

380
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,700
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.

381
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,135
Gentlemen, if I could just
have your attention.

382
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,344
Everyone, Mr. Collins
and Mr. Morris...

383
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,812
...will answer questions
at the press conference...

384
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,712
...at the Palace Del Sol.

385
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,887
Gentlemen, there will be
plenty of time...

386
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:53,546
...to answer your questions
at the Palace Del Sol.

387
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,818
Thank you, we will answer your
questions at the press conference.

388
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,996
Thank you for coming.

389
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,995
<i>We had a full police escort, along
with bodyguards who were there...</i>

390
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,107
<i>...to protect us from any thoughts
we might have of going AWOL...</i>

391
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,072
<i>...prior to this press conference.</i>

392
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,406
<i>A pair of New Jersey's finest
walked on either side of us...</i>

393
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,175
<i>...as we entered
the lobby of the hotel.</i>

394
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,114
<i>It was an indication of how
legitimate the Mob had gone...</i>

395
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,515
<i>...that they could
bring in the local police...</i>

396
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,191
<i>...to guard the facade of their racket.</i>

397
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,889
<i>The local chief was a man
named Jack Scaglia.</i>

398
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,998
And of course, the two
gentlemen on my right...

399
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,499
...who need no introduction,
have come here directly...

400
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,366
...from their record-breaking
polio telethon in Miami, Florida.

401
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,899
So the first thing I'd like to announce
is that Mr. Sanmarco...

402
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,641
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

403
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,407
<i>...that Sally Sanmarco
was a slim, 6-foot-6 guy...</i>

404
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,608
<i>...who looked like a prince
and spoke with an English accent.</i>

405
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,185
<i>Then I wouldn't be
falling back on the stereotype.</i>

406
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:01,050
<i>The trouble was, Sally was
straight out of central casting.</i>

407
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,918
<i>A gangster
who looked and talked...</i>

408
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,757
<i>...just like you would expect
from the movies.</i>

409
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,559
How did it feel to raise
all that money for polio?

410
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,296
It felt great. It felt really great.

411
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,371
<i>From a publicity angle, and in
terms of giving him legitimacy...</i>

412
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,804
<i>...this was a huge coup for Sally.</i>

413
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,477
<i>Like I said, we were gods.</i>

414
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,375
<i>We'd only been in the New York area
for an hour or so, during which time...</i>

415
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,348
<i>...we were constantly watched
by police and reporters...</i>

416
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,283
<i>...which ended up being
a good thing for us.</i>

417
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,923
We got you our best bridal suite.

418
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,417
Fucking nice, huh?

419
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,258
People talk about having fancy
apartments and hotel rooms...

420
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,558
...on the West Side of Manhattan.
What do they see?

421
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,930
Fucking New Jersey.
Here, you see New York City.

422
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,612
<i>Unfortunately,
Vince and I were acquainted...</i>

423
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,114
<i>...with the dead girl in the bathroom
of our hotel suite in New Jersey.</i>

424
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,883
<i>Her last name was O'Flaherty.</i>

425
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,450
<i>Her first name was Maureen.</i>

426
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,355
<i>Karen, we decided to trade
apartments, not identities.</i>

427
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,087
<i>Why didn't you make up a name?</i>

428
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,823
Bonnie, I was looking
at a five-hour flight.

429
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,162
I didn't wanna make up a life story
that wasn't attached to anything.

430
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,863
Well, I returned the offense.
I got to pretend I was you.

431
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,632
<i>-What?
-You received a package.</i>

432
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,141
Messenger service.
I signed your name.

433
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,973
-Who's it from?
-No address. Want me to open it?

434
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,705
-Sure.
-That's good. I already did.

435
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,178
It's a manuscript.

436
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,819
"Excerpt From the Memoirs of...

437
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,784
...Lanny Morris. "

438
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,982
Hey, all your dreams are coming true.
He's writing you love letters already.

439
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,161
Bonnie, I need
to know what he's written.

440
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:48,321
-Well, I'll send it to you.
-Now. Before he calls me tomorrow.

441
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,503
-Please?
-All right.

442
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,737
All right.

443
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,374
Here we go.

444
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,681
"Let me explain to you why two
very famous guys just finishing...

445
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:09,013
...a nationally broadcast telethon
ended up in New Jersey. "

446
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:18,857
<i>For years, the Palace Del Sol was
one of the centers of Mob prosperity.</i>

447
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,056
<i>Needless to say, a major
headliner in the showroom...</i>

448
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,430
<i>...helped legitimize
the entire operation.</i>

449
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,366
Give her a kiss. Yeah, beautiful.

450
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,598
One more, guys. That's it.
That's great. Thank you.

451
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,243
<i>Vince and I needed help
in keeping us up all the time...</i>

452
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,640
<i>...and in the way of thinking
in the '50s...</i>

453
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,077
<i>...anything you didn't take
with a needle was okay.</i>

454
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,946
<i>It wasn't "serious" serious.
It was like running a red light.</i>

455
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:47,022
<i>Everyone used bennies. Vince added
them to his morning coffee like sugar.</i>

456
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,055
<i>Not that you could tell.</i>

457
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,858
<i>When we did finally
decide to flatten out...</i>

458
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:02,028
<i>...we'd take two or three Tuinals,
or three or four "Threeinals. "</i>

459
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,537
<i>They were really good.</i>

460
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,040
<i>Between the moment you took them
and passing out...</i>

461
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,407
<i>...it felt really sexy.</i>

462
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,177
Sure.

463
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,511
-Enjoyed the show.
-Thank you.

464
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,882
<i>The walls of the Blue Grotto...</i>

465
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,755
<i>...were made of a mixture
of plaster and Styrofoam.</i>

466
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,829
<i>Flammable as all hell. But the boys
had learned it was cheaper...</i>

467
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,490
<i>...to give the inspector 200 bucks
and a ringside table to our show...</i>

468
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,933
<i>...than to spend thousands
of dollars on fireproofing.</i>

469
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,370
<i>Besides, it was always vital in
a business enterprise of this sort...</i>

470
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,273
<i>...to have the option to torch the place
at a moment's notice...</i>

471
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,846
<i>...should the need present itself.</i>

472
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,044
<i>One night, after our show,
we were taken to Sally's office.</i>

473
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,812
<i>We wondered
what we had done wrong...</i>

474
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,650
<i>...but what we had done
was done good.</i>

475
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,122
<i>Sally started going on about
how much he liked us...</i>

476
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,091
<i>...how he thought we were
a good fit with his crowd...</i>

477
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,027
<i>...meaning that we brought in
an audience of heavy drinkers...</i>

478
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,098
<i>...adulterers and gamblers.</i>

479
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,793
So, what we want is for you boys
to come back here...

480
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,802
...three months from now
and open our new showroom for us.

481
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,774
A two-week,
exclusive limited engagement...

482
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,879
...that we want you to do for us
for six weeks.

483
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,010
<i>God help you when a killer
takes a shining to you.</i>

484
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:58,155
<i>I looked at Vince and scratched my
nose, which meant our strongest "no. "</i>

485
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,085
That's a very great honor, Sally.

486
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,759
-You're damn fucking right it is.
-The thing is...

487
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,021
...we're just trying to cut down on
the nightclub work at the moment.

488
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,825
We turned down the Sands
so we could do a TV special...

489
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,060
...and the only reason we still work the
Versailles is out of friendship for you.

490
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,110
-What dates were you thinking of?
-We open November 15th.

491
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,939
Sally, any other day
we would be here in a flash...

492
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,173
...but, you know, that's the day
right after the next polio telethon.

493
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,444
I mean, we always take two weeks off
right after that to recover.

494
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,848
-Right, Vince?
-At least.

495
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,148
-I mean, we're tired.
-That's the way I want you.

496
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,987
After the fucking telethon,
we fly you up from Miami...

497
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,891
...hold a press conference,
all fucking exhausted...

498
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,089
...so people know
what heroes you are.

499
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,602
I'll keep a suite for you
with the best hookers I got.

500
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,896
Your own personal cathouse.

501
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,573
And I'll have them send you up...

502
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,708
...a shipment of lobsters
and stone crabs.

503
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,344
-You like lobsters?
-Love them.

504
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,240
And a case of these...

505
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,075
...special grapefruits...

506
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,117
...that I get special down there.

507
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,454
The most delicious thing
you ever tasted in your life.

508
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,921
Juicy, thin skin.

509
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,489
<i>Months later, on the night
before the telethon in Miami...</i>

510
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,063
<i>...we got back to our room
and found that Sally...</i>

511
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,463
<i>...had been more than good
to his word.</i>

512
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,967
<i>Laid out around the room
were various crates...</i>

513
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,665
<i>...bearing the addresses
of their destination:</i>

514
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,244
<i>Our suite at the Palace Del Sol
hotel in New Jersey.</i>

515
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,441
"You like lobsters?
See you in New Jersey. "

516
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,685
"Thin skin, fucking most delicious
fucking thing...

517
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,551
...you ever had in your fucking life. "

518
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,556
"What I thought was a box
of beach balls turned out to be...

519
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,025
...the thinnest-skinned,
dripping-wet grapefruits...

520
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,822
...I'd ever tasted in my life.

521
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,626
The 6-foot crate was filled
with fruits of the sea...

522
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,668
...slowly shifting over a bed of ice. "

523
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,466
Yeah, this is Lanny Morris.
Send up three steaks, all right?

524
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,006
Yeah. Make them rare this time.

525
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,541
-Yeah, rare.
-Like bloody.

526
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,010
Bloody. And a couple of bottles
of that champagne.

527
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,183
-Make that three.
-Three bottles of champagne.

528
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,785
And can you make sure
that Maureen delivers them?

529
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,615
Yeah, Maureen.

530
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,613
<i>We called down for Maureen...</i>

531
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,656
<i>...the room-service girl
I'd met earlier...</i>

532
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,351
<i>...who wanted the interview
for her school paper.</i>

533
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,157
<i>She brought up three steaks,
one for her...</i>

534
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,199
<i>...as her last official delivery
of the day.</i>

535
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,960
<i>As much as I love lobster...</i>

536
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,230
<i>...seeing all that shellfish
nestled on ice in the crate...</i>

537
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,399
<i>...put me in the mood
for hooves, not claws.</i>

538
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,864
<i>The interview for Maureen's campus
paper went better than expected.</i>

539
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,297
<i>Vince and I popped some Tuinals...</i>

540
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,801
<i>...to insure that
we would sleep like babes...</i>

541
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:05,874
<i>...after we wore off the general
horniness that the pills first give you.</i>

542
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:11,942
<i>Vince bought insurance on his bet
by having a few babes on hand.</i>

543
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,313
<i>Well, not exactly on his hand.</i>

544
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,885
<i>That wasn't his preference.</i>

545
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,489
"Not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference. "

546
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:25,822
"Not exactly on his hand"?
"That wasn't his preference"?

547
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,458
"The Tuinals, coupled with
a nice amount of booze...

548
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,192
...guaranteed us
the sleep of the dead.

549
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,871
Late the next morning,
Maureen was sent packing...

550
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:41,012
...and Vince and I prepared ourselves
for that night's broadcast. "

551
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,571
Well, I guess this is one story my kids
won't have to give a book report on.

552
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,217
Thanks.

553
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,615
Must be weird to find out...

554
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,554
...that the object of all your
adolescent fantasies is a pig.

555
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,590
He's not like that.

556
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,460
Oh, so it's just the way
he describes himself.

557
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,065
<i>She was right.</i>

558
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,795
<i>Which was the real Lanny?</i>

559
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,400
<i>I'd find out later that the story
of the hookers in the hotel suite...</i>

560
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,078
<i>...was a complete fabrication.</i>

561
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,009
<i>That night, Maureen was alone.</i>

562
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,468
<i>-Hello?
-So how did you like the show?</i>

563
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,203
<i>Lanny?</i>

564
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,047
<i>The Today show.</i>

565
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,617
You did watch, didn't you?

566
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,854
<i>-The show.
-You didn't watch.</i>

567
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,217
<i>Wow, that's scary.</i>

568
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,991
You see, when you're a star...

569
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,223
...you live in terror,
wondering if it's all over yet.

570
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,264
You keep looking for the signs.

571
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,529
You're shooting a scene from a movie
on a New York street...

572
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,933
...and a crowd doesn't form.

573
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,937
You meet a girl on a plane
and tell her...

574
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,804
<i>...that you're gonna be on the
Today show the next morning...</i>

575
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,776
...and she doesn't
wake up early to watch.

576
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,744
It's very scary.

577
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,585
Hey, you know,
I mentioned you on the air.

578
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,656
<i>-You did?
-Yes, I proposed to you on the air.</i>

579
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,725
Your building is probably
surrounded with photographers...

580
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,624
<i>-... at this very moment.
-You're kidding.</i>

581
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,731
Yes, I'm kidding.

582
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,659
So...

583
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,035
...what time would you like to meet?

584
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,064
Stanley, this is Bonnie.
Bonnie, Stanley.

585
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,757
Nice to meet you.

586
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,334
Is the food almost ready, Stan?

587
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,438
Yeah. I'll bring it right out,
Mr. Lanny.

588
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,536
I was very hungry, so I asked Stanley
to prepare us something special.

589
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,735
That sounds great.

590
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,138
Tell me, what kind of a meeting...

591
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,217
...does a schoolteacher have to go to
during the summer vacation?

592
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,513
I'm exploring the possibility
of another job.

593
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,352
-Something in publishing.
-How did it go?

594
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,027
Okay.

595
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,156
Have you ever thought
about writing a book?

596
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,892
-About what?
-Your life.

597
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,899
Sure. When I'm dead.

598
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,935
No, seriously.

599
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,266
It would have to be published
after I died...

600
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,376
...when I wouldn't care what
anybody thought about me.

601
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,248
So, what would you write about,
if you were going to tell the truth?

602
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,144
In my book?

603
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,976
Well, the truth is,
I've met four presidents.

604
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,951
They all seemed like
they were out of it.

605
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,091
Like they had no idea
what was going on.

606
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,592
Even J.F.k. left me unimpressed.
I felt like I was with the boss' son.

607
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,354
You don't think you could say that?

608
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,624
Not if I was planning
on living in this country. No, no.

609
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,769
I don't think that Judy Garland
was such a great singer...

610
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,370
...after she turned 16.

611
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,939
That quiver, you know,
it was like she had no control over it.

612
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,111
I would get killed for saying that.

613
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,577
Or that Marilyn Monroe
was no better an actress...

614
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,274
...after she studied with
Lee Strasberg than before.

615
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,421
I'm saying what really happened.

616
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,387
Having to be a nice guy...

617
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,894
...is the toughest job in the world
when you're not.

618
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,163
This is a lamb in tea sauce.

619
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,173
This is twice-cooked pork
with shredded, pickled cabbage.

620
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,046
kung Pao chicken.

621
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,809
And this is kung Ping Loh Haa...

622
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,613
...lobster in tangerine peel
for you and your lovely lady friend.

623
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,990
You shouldn't have
done that, Stanley.

624
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,092
I don't eat lobster. I'm Jewish.

625
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,522
But you eat pork.

626
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,353
-Do you have a problem with that?
-No, I just thought-

627
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:31,433
No shrimp, no lobster.
They're disgusting. Take it away.

628
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,331
I will pay for the dish,
but take it away, please.

629
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,433
I'll change it.

630
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,906
I'm sorry, I...

631
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,443
I should have asked.
Maybe you love lobster.

632
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,375
I'm fine.

633
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,778
Have you ever had
Szechwan cuisine before?

634
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,510
It's from the northern part of China.

635
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,087
It must be strange for you.

636
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:58,860
If you complain to a waiter,
you're not just some jerk at table five...

637
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,257
...you're Lanny Morris.

638
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,923
I know that everyone
dreams about being famous...

639
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,898
...but it would be interesting
to know...

640
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,071
...what it's like
to relinquish all anonymity.

641
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,405
-Gets me a date.
-Does that bother you?

642
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,447
That people only wanna be with you
because of who you are?

643
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,744
-As opposed to?
-Well...

644
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,818
...the real you.

645
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,918
The real me.

646
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:35,158
The real me was brought up
as a nice middle-class kid...

647
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,993
...which is not the easiest thing...

648
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,637
...when you are extremely poor
and living in a slum.

649
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:46,073
The real me spent most of his time
getting the shit kicked out of him...

650
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,802
...and dreaming about
something better.

651
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,414
Like being here
with someone like you.

652
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:58,712
<i>Fifteen years ago, he had,
for one brief moment...</i>

653
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,790
<i>...made me feel like
the most special person in the world.</i>

654
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:06,395
"The miracle in my life
is not that I survived polio...

655
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,497
...and am standing here today.

656
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,726
No. The reason I consider myself
to be a miracle girl...

657
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,598
...is because I had
the good fortune...

658
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,932
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick. "

659
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,203
<i>It was a moment
seen by millions of people...</i>

660
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:25,075
<i>...but felt only by me.</i>

661
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:33,020
<i>That moment had changed my life.</i>

662
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:40,161
<i>I was about to find my own way
into Lanny's book...</i>

663
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,064
<i>...after he had found
such a powerful way into mine.</i>

664
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,909
Checking out today?

665
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,957
Is there a message
for Bonnie Trout?

666
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,564
-From one of our guests?
-Yes, Lanny Morris.

667
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,064
I'm afraid not.

668
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:31,434
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yes, I'm sure.

669
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,777
Do you need a cab?

670
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,882
I still don't understand
why Vince Collins is willing...

671
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,548
<i>...to be involved in such
an expos of himself.</i>

672
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,557
Vince is a realist.

673
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,458
The days of his box-office
power are drawing to a close.

674
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,662
Given the amount of money
we're offering-

675
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,496
And it's because the investment
in Mr. Collins is so large...

676
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:06,643
...I've compiled a list of questions
we'd like the miracle girl to ask.

677
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:17,209
I don't wanna look at your questions.
I have my own approach.

678
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,481
Ms. O'Connor, we're not paying
a million dollars for your approach...

679
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,852
...we're paying for what
Vince Collins has to say.

680
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,223
To me. What he has to say to me.

681
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,828
Greg, this is not as easy as it looks.

682
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,165
If you go to Vince Collins
and ask him a series of questions...

683
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,634
<i>...you'll come back here
with a 300-page press book.</i>

684
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,933
Well, as I've always understood
this company's policy...

685
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,168
...while the book is being written...

686
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:45,815
...the relationship between the author
and editor is sacrosanct.

687
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,977
This isn't your typical book deal.

688
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:53,345
We've really just leased
an oil well called Vince Collins...

689
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,890
...and granted Ms. O'Connor
the right to tap.

690
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,585
I think we have a responsibility to...

691
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,363
...monitor the drilling.

692
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,081
-Hello.
-Mrs. O'Flaherty?

693
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,183
Yes.

694
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,057
My name's O'Connor.
I'm the one writing the book.

695
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,375
The book will be
centered around Vince Collins.

696
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,415
I'll be asking him a lot of questions.

697
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:59,646
I wanted to know if there were any
you'd like to have answered yourself.

698
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,088
Maureen and I planted this tree
on her fifth birthday.

699
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,002
Father did most of the digging,
of course.

700
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,232
<i>She'd be 38.</i>

701
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,133
<i>I'm 59 myself.</i>

702
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,006
If she were alive now...

703
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,977
...we'd be talking about things,
back and forth...

704
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,984
...like two women.

705
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,988
Like you and I are doing.

706
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,826
And Maureen's father?

707
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,359
Frank died six years ago.

708
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,131
He took his own life.

709
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,800
One night, just before he died...

710
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,138
...he dug up the earth
around this tree...

711
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,445
...he took the urn
with Maureen's ashes in it...

712
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,380
...and spread them around its roots.

713
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:08,054
So this is my daughter.

714
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,287
This is what I have of her.

715
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,999
<i>-Are you Catholic?
-My-My mother was.</i>

716
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,298
<i>Then you will understand
my dilemma.</i>

717
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,206
<i>Our faith offers an afterlife.</i>

718
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,746
A daughter needs her mother.

719
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:39,847
So I have to live out this life
as far from sin as I can manage.

720
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,421
<i>I'll never see my husband again.</i>

721
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,363
<i>He's consigned himself to hell.</i>

722
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,259
<i>But what if Maureen
killed herself too?</i>

723
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,603
She's in hell, with my husband.

724
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,941
The life I'm trying to lead
will bring me to heaven's grace...

725
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,383
...only to hear
their screams of torment.

726
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,151
<i>Chief Scaglia,
you were in the hotel room...</i>

727
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,520
<i>...when they found
Maureen's body in the tub.</i>

728
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,862
So was Sally, so was Lanny,
so was Vince.

729
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:26,496
And there was also
a PR lady there from the hotel.

730
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,462
How do you think she died?

731
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,199
She died in an auto accident
two weeks later. It was terrible.

732
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,873
No, Maureen.

733
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,742
-How did Maureen die?
-She drowned.

734
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,747
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

735
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,477
You and I take baths all the time.
We don't drown in them.

736
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,714
You and I do not mix
sleeping pills with booze.

737
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,860
-She committed suicide?
-Overdose is the official story.

738
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,895
What's the official story on the fact
that the staff of the hotel in Miami...

739
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,158
<i>...all seemed to know she delivered
room service to the boys' suite...</i>

740
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,201
...three days before
and was never seen alive again?

741
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,736
What happened to her?

742
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,408
How did she end up
in a hotel room in New Jersey?

743
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,477
Sally never had any problem
moving girls around. Okay?

744
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,874
He had two hotels.

745
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,072
-So Sally arranged it?
-No, I don't think so.

746
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,150
You see, she was brought up there
as a reward for the boys...

747
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,015
...and I think she started
to party just a little too early.

748
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,713
She was a student.
This was a summer job.

749
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,187
Listen to me...

750
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:29,566
...the Palace Del Sol was very
important to Sally, okay?

751
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,929
He launched his new wing...

752
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,435
...with a push
from Lanny and Vince...

753
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,272
...and this stupid girl
shows up dead.

754
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,107
She's not gonna come back.
We do the best thing for all of us.

755
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,777
We speed up the investigation
and we cremate her. Okay?

756
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,184
End of story.

757
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,589
-Here you are.
-Here's your lobster.

758
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,732
-Enjoy.
-Looks great.

759
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,934
"Sally said, 'I'll have them send you
up your own shipment of lobsters.

760
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,164
<i>You like lobster?"'</i>

761
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,041
<i>We said we did
because we really did.</i>

762
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,713
<i>You shouldn't have done that,
Stanley. I don't eat lobster.</i>

763
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,051
<i>Were there any signs of violence
on her body?</i>

764
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:28,554
No, no. There were some
small scratches on the torso.

765
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,830
<i>Why did my daughter die?
Did she kill herself?</i>

766
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:40,294
<i>What had they done to her
that would make her do that?</i>

767
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,136
<i>What had they done?</i>

768
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,344
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

769
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,212
<i>...when terrible things
happened to people...</i>

770
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,980
<i>...they were left as a mystery.</i>

771
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:04,389
<i>Even the tabloids kept a distance.</i>

772
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:15,568
<i>Some things were allowed
to be left just the way they were.</i>

773
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,212
Any trouble with the directions
I gave you?

774
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,852
-Only the parts where I had to turn.
-Sorry.

775
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,154
It's the price of seclusion.

776
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,219
You haven't switched over
to cassette?

777
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,298
-Actually, it's my dad's.
-And what does he do?

778
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,796
He was a journalist too.

779
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,204
He did a big story on you once.

780
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,070
Followed a little girl who had polio.

781
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,675
You took her under your wing...

782
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,146
...and now she's interviewing you.

783
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,951
He must be proud that his daughter's
making such a name for herself.

784
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,584
I'd like to think so.

785
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,389
-He died last year.
-Sorry to hear that.

786
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:19,661
-Would you like some coffee?
-Sure.

787
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,608
Are you alone here?

788
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,839
Yes. The thought of having live-in help
is a little poisonous to me.

789
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,448
Why's that?

790
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,551
Well, I'd have to talk to them...

791
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,187
...ask them how
their family was doing...

792
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,017
...hear about this and that,
introduce them to the guests...

793
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,887
...and tell them
how their family was doing.

794
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,792
All so that I would
seem to be a nice guy...

795
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,591
...which is an awful lot of work...

796
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,234
...considering what I cherish
most in life these days...

797
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,495
...is not to have to be Vince Collins.

798
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,138
No Reuben in your life?

799
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,432
How do you know about Reuben?

800
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,337
He was in a lot of the material
I've been looking at.

801
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,015
No, I never had a Reuben.

802
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,582
Lanny always paid him directly.
He was Lanny's man.

803
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,252
Right.

804
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,715
You know, what I like is to...

805
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,517
...read...

806
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,026
...think.

807
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,424
It's to have the freedom...

808
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,122
...to get up and leave
without telling anyone about it...

809
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,234
...any time of day.

810
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,570
Or even having to say goodbye.

811
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:36,735
To be backstage, surrounded
by acrobats, actors, magicians...

812
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,812
...it was intoxicating.

813
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,846
You know, I was only 12 years old.

814
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,678
That's a...

815
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,410
That's a pretty impressionable age.

816
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,681
<i>-To hear all these stories of touring...
-My father always told me...</i>

817
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,383
<i>...that nothing had meaning
unless it could be put on the record.</i>

818
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,887
<i>Yet things had changed.</i>

819
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,125
<i>As Vince had pointed out
at our first meeting...</i>

820
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:02,635
<i>...it had become fashionable
to put yourself into the story.</i>

821
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,639
<i>The question became
how far you were prepared to go.</i>

822
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:34,267
-Excuse me. That's not mine.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

823
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,402
Aren't you Miss Trout?

824
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,237
We've met,
on the plane to New York.

825
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,639
-Reuben.
-Excuse me, sir.

826
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,611
Can I leave you
for just a second, please?

827
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,117
I'm so deeply sorry, Miss Trout,
the way you were treated.

828
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:57,350
-He could have left a note.
-Of course.

829
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,189
Miss Trout, I would like you
to understand something.

830
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,766
I have a great loyalty to Mr. Morris.
He's treated me very well.

831
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,666
I'm very grateful.

832
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:14,100
He has done wonderful things
for many people...

833
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:19,271
...and I have been privileged
to work for him.

834
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,148
But I do have certain principles...

835
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:27,585
...especially about how women
are to be treated and respected.

836
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:33,395
Mr. Morris can be very attentive,
but once he has a woman...

837
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,362
Oh, God, I think
it's almost a sickness.

838
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,200
When he left you that morning...

839
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:44,032
...you may have felt bad,
but believe me, Miss Trout...

840
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,071
...to have him out of your life...

841
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,972
...is the best thing that
could have happened to you.

842
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,709
At that point, you may have felt
your life was wounded.

843
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,082
It wasn't.

844
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,216
It was saved.

845
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,697
<i>Vince, I was very clear about this
from the beginning.</i>

846
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,492
<i>I'm not out to play games with you.</i>

847
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,068
<i>This is why you're being paid
a huge amount of money.</i>

848
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,903
<i>This isn't entirely about money,
you know.</i>

849
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,668
A million dollars is more than
the gross of your last film.

850
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,242
I was somehow
under the impression that my life...

851
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,416
...might have been of more than
passing interest.

852
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,609
But if my fleeting encounter with
a girl named Maureen O'Flaherty...

853
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,755
...is all you really want to talk about,
then that's what we'll do.

854
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,556
I have to make an appearance
at the clinic tomorrow.

855
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,888
We can come back
and talk after that.

856
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,659
It's Wonderland.

857
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,458
I imagine you might remember that.

858
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,778
<i>He was right.
I did remember Wonderland.</i>

859
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,382
-You ready?
-Ready.

860
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:10,855
<i>When I was a girl, the entire hospital
was devoted to children with polio.</i>

861
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,726
<i>Since that time,
it had become a clinic for kids...</i>

862
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,163
<i>...with a variety of different
physical handicaps.</i>

863
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,139
<i>Once a year, the children
would put on a pageant...</i>

864
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,675
<i>...playing different characters
from Alice in Wonderland.</i>

865
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,114
<i>Vince, in his continuing support
of the hospital...</i>

866
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,807
<i>...had hired a band and a singer.</i>

867
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,988
Who is that?

868
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:49,029
I don't know.
She's good, whoever she is.

869
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,708
karen, do you mind if we start
this conversation tomorrow?

870
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,542
I'm just...
I'm not feeling all that well.

871
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,708
-Vince-
-In fact, it won't make...

872
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,183
...any difference over there.
The office is closed.

873
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,582
They've been working late.

874
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,781
Then they've been working
much too hard.

875
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,754
First thing tomorrow. First thing.

876
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,136
I hope your editors were reasonable.

877
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,308
Reasonable? No, they weren't.

878
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,568
We can go as late as you like.

879
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,039
That's good.

880
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,679
It might take us
into the evening.

881
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,849
I had a feeling
that might be the case.

882
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,012
So I've ordered a hot and cold
smorgasbord to be brought in.

883
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,686
We can work through dinner.

884
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,083
-We'll be having company?
-Yes.

885
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,082
I have...

886
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,988
...a surprise for you.

887
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,693
Actually, this is a fairly big deal
for me as well.

888
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,300
I've asked Lanny to join us today.

889
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,627
Lanny?

890
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,133
Well, this is something.

891
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,035
Neuman and Newberry will certainly
be getting their money's worth.

892
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,910
I thought that if I was
going to discuss something...

893
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,912
...that had such an impact
on our lives...

894
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,711
...it would be fair for Lanny
to hear what I had to say.

895
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,115
Given that we've
never talked about it.

896
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,984
I'm sure I'll have lots to ask him.
When is he coming?

897
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,125
He should be here any minute now.

898
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,525
This is very exciting.

899
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,893
Shit.

900
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,776
<i>-Yes?
-Bonnie, I have to talk fast.</i>

901
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:49,042
I need you to do exactly as I tell you
and I can't tell you why, okay?

902
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,480
<i>Sure.</i>

903
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,586
Excuse me, that might actually
be him now.

904
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,319
Yes, hello?

905
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,263
Yes, thank you.

906
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,339
That was my office.

907
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,011
There's a woman-
A friend, a relative of yours?

908
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,612
She said she called
on a number you gave her.

909
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,182
She's gonna call back.

910
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,784
<i>-Yes?
-Hi, kiddo.</i>

911
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,121
<i>Listen, your brother Clifford
has just been rushed to the hospital.</i>

912
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,092
<i>He was doing construction
when a thing-</i>

913
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,095
<i>-A steel girder?
-That's it.</i>

914
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,791
<i>You better come to the city
and make your peace with him.</i>

915
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,164
<i>You're booked on the next
flight to San Francisco.</i>

916
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,533
<i>I'm waiting here for you
in front of the terminal.</i>

917
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,441
They reserved me a seat
on the next flight to San Francisco.

918
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,941
-I'll drive you there.
-No, no.

919
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,205
Sharon is waiting at the airport for me.
You can't stand Lanny up.

920
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,849
Please give him
my deepest apologies.

921
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:07,090
-Hey.
-Please, I can explain.

922
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,194
You've broken the law,
Bonnie-fucking-Trout.

923
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,231
You've assumed
another person's identity...

924
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,801
...to get information
from a business competitor.

925
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,666
Obviously I lied about who I was.
I'm sorry.

926
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,069
It was a huge untruth.
It wasn't planned.

927
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:24,804
I was just freaked out about
suddenly being on the plane with-

928
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,213
With you...

929
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,715
How did you get the seat
behind me on the plane?

930
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,546
-It was pure coincidence.
-Bullshit!

931
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,187
It's true.

932
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,957
How could you-? How could you have
just left me at the hotel like that?

933
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,558
You were asleep.

934
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,962
Reuben woke me to say
I had to be a substitute performer...

935
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:50,401
...at a charity concert at the Hollywood
Bowl. I had to get the first flight out.

936
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,164
You could have left a note
or called.

937
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,434
-I did leave you a note.
-Where?

938
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,874
I don't know why we're even talking
about this. I don't like you.

939
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,018
All right? I wish we had never met.

940
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,085
Hello, Vince.

941
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,555
What the fuck's going on?

942
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,159
Vince, a few days after we first met...

943
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,199
...I found myself next to Lanny
on a flight to New York.

944
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,030
It was a complete coincidence.

945
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,899
-He asked my name-
-And she lied.

946
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,372
I had just finished reading the first
chapter of Lanny's own biography.

947
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,978
His lawyers had let me see it in the
hope of discouraging our own project.

948
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,705
As a reflex, since I knew he
would view me as the enemy...

949
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,543
...I gave him the name of a friend...

950
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,845
...whose apartment I was
staying at in Manhattan.

951
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:41,353
I thought I just had to get through
the awkwardness of the flight itself...

952
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,548
-... but the trouble is-
-You slept with him.

953
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,795
-Vince-
-You slept with my ex-partner.

954
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,494
Technically.

955
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,097
Doesn't sound like things were
particularly technical.

956
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,918
Now, you listen to me, sweetheart.

957
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,632
Vince doesn't always do
what's best for Vince.

958
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,428
That's why he needed me
here today.

959
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:32,096
The story of this girl is the
most painful thing in his life.

960
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,469
What happened to her, Lanny?

961
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,545
Well, you're not gonna find out.

962
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,039
Not now.

963
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,944
Not after what you've done to him.

964
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,955
Vince.

965
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,460
Oh, shit.

966
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,459
Vince...

967
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,637
...I made a terrible mistake
in New York.

968
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,205
I apologize to you
more than I know how to say.

969
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,638
I'm so sorry.

970
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,752
Vince, the realization
of your life story...

971
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,585
...shouldn't be threatened
because of my failings.

972
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,525
Please let me continue
to work with you again.

973
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,064
I'll help you tell your story right.

974
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,604
Come back tonight.

975
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,335
Let me think about it.

976
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,857
-How do you like the wine?
-It's magnificent. What is it?

977
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,550
<i>1961 Haut-Brion.</i>

978
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,491
<i>People make a big deal of 1959...</i>

979
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:05,030
<i>...but I don't think there'll be
a year as special as 1961.</i>

980
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:08,432
It was a great year for French wines.

981
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,708
Will you join me?

982
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,135
What are they?

983
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,843
They're like very mild-mannered
Quaaludes.

984
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,176
Must've done a few of those
in your time, right?

985
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,383
Are you sure they're okay
with alcohol?

986
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,116
Oh, they're even better with alcohol.
Believe me, I'd know.

987
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,425
Come on in, honey. The water's fine.

988
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:44,337
<i>All my life, I've had this idea
that I could always be in control.</i>

989
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,875
<i>Ever since I was sick,
I had this sense...</i>

990
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:50,239
<i>...that I could make my body
do anything I wanted.</i>

991
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,107
<i>If I could will my polio away...</i>

992
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,773
<i>...I'd certainly be able to will away
the effect of any drug.</i>

993
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:13,195
Do you mind if I close the drapes?
The sun's in my eyes.

994
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,836
It's moonlight.

995
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,798
Go ahead.

996
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,796
I remember you.

997
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,136
You're Alice.

998
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,937
In Wonderland.

999
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,840
Oh, I don't know.

1000
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,448
I'm really stoned
out of my head already.

1001
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,309
Is it good?

1002
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,954
Jesus, Vince. It's like monster grass.

1003
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,427
Do you get this stuff all the time?

1004
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,623
All the time.

1005
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,410
You're Alice.

1006
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,909
You're so beautiful.

1007
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,846
She's ours.

1008
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,539
Isn't that so, Alice?

1009
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,917
I'm yours.

1010
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,051
I like you.

1011
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,966
<i>I had always been fascinated by how
some women could cross the line...</i>

1012
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:40,802
<i>...between who they were and who
they would let themselves become.</i>

1013
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,205
<i>Maureen...</i>

1014
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,777
<i>...Alice...</i>

1015
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,006
<i>...and now...</i>

1016
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:49,775
<i>...me.</i>

1017
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,623
Morning.

1018
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:01,125
That was not a Quaalude you
gave me. I've had Quaaludes.

1019
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:03,762
I said it was like a Quaalude.

1020
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,332
And you didn't take one yourself.
You palmed the pill.

1021
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,526
Somebody had to drive.

1022
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,302
Don't worry, you won't get pregnant.

1023
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,338
Not from Alice,
and certainly not from me.

1024
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,102
I never took off my pants,
as you may or may not remember.

1025
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,973
There are laws against
drugging people.

1026
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,173
Oh, please. You took it voluntarily.
Nobody slipped it into your drink.

1027
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:27,153
And you chased it with one of the most
expensive wines in the world.

1028
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:30,757
You're just in a dither because you've
discovered you can swing both ways.

1029
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,893
You see...

1030
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,830
...I needed to get something on you.

1031
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:41,298
Of course, your behavior with Lanny
might have been even better than this.

1032
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,266
But I'd already set the wheels
in motion.

1033
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:47,465
And as I was dying to see
you and Alice get it on...

1034
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,070
Well, these are just a sample.

1035
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,519
Why would she agree to do this?
Doesn't she want a career?

1036
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,987
Well, it's your career
I'm worried about.

1037
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,891
You're a journalist
playing loose with the rules.

1038
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,820
She's just a vulnerable young singer
you seduced.

1039
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:12,057
A promising-Oh, good heavens.

1040
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,164
Promising artist
that I happen to manage.

1041
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,168
You met her through me...

1042
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,273
...and had your way with her.

1043
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,606
What do you want from me?

1044
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,916
You're going to continue
writing the book.

1045
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,022
I'm going to continue telling you
juicy stories, funny stories...

1046
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,317
...heart-tugging stories.

1047
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,789
And you're not going to ask me
a single question...

1048
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,225
...about what happened
to the girl in New Jersey.

1049
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,358
You're going to go to your publisher,
say you tried every angle...

1050
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,503
...but you could find nothing odd
or suspicious in what I told you.

1051
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,213
I'll even try to spice it up a little,
talk about how...

1052
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,384
...the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe...

1053
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,848
...so to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1054
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,379
Well, not exactly on my hand...

1055
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,956
...and that's not my preference,
as you might have gathered by now.

1056
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:24,438
So you get your bestseller,
I get my million.

1057
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,902
Everyone goes home happy.

1058
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:29,339
You've dreaded talking about
Maureen O'Flaherty since we met.

1059
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,706
If it's something you're so
desperate to avoid...

1060
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,905
...why would you ever agree
to do this book?

1061
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,277
I need the money.

1062
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,886
Vince, anything you say
in my presence is mine to use.

1063
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,790
Everything you said last night
and everything you've just told me.

1064
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,722
And since I'm also allowed to include
contextual background...

1065
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,954
...I can write about
how you set me up...

1066
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:52,531
...how you tried to blackmail me.
I'll even include those Polaroids.

1067
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,068
It's your word against mine. We have
a contract. Everything's in my words.

1068
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,570
We've agreed to your answers,
but there's nothing to stop me...

1069
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:04,474
...from putting any information I want
into a question I ask.

1070
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,516
Information that I'd like to be
public knowledge...

1071
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,919
...or that the police
might wanna look into.

1072
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,892
Would you like me to fire one of my
loaded questions, on the record?

1073
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,527
Sure.

1074
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,597
Vince...

1075
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,544
...in your suite
at the Versailles Hotel in Miami...

1076
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,578
...was it your or Lanny's idea...

1077
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,115
...to put Maureen's body into the case
containing shellfish and ice...

1078
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,979
...and have it shipped
to New Jersey?

1079
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,725
No answer, Mr. Collins?
So noted.

1080
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,229
Oh, and incidentally,
by not answering...

1081
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,026
...you're in violation of your contract.

1082
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,832
What a shame.
I understood you needed that money.

1083
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,714
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1084
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,619
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God!

1085
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:34,164
Was that how
you murdered Maureen?

1086
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,447
Ask Lanny.

1087
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,246
He's the one who knows.

1088
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:16,438
<i>It wasn't that hard for him
to get the suite he wanted.</i>

1089
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:20,638
<i>The Versailles was still one of the
fanciest of the hotels along the beach.</i>

1090
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,511
<i>But by then, its era had passed.</i>

1091
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,512
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,296
<i>All the furniture was new.</i>

1093
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,866
<i>It had been 15 years...</i>

1094
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,561
<i>...but the floor plan...</i>

1095
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,933
<i>...was still the same.</i>

1096
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,972
<i>In that spot...</i>

1097
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,212
<i>...that was where the truth
had come out.</i>

1098
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,046
<i>That was why she had to die.</i>

1099
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,455
Are you Japanese or Chinese?

1100
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,394
Vietnamese.

1101
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:16,133
The kitchen tell me
you famous person.

1102
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,272
Why you famous?

1103
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,767
They didn't tell you my name?

1104
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,170
No.

1105
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,072
What is it?

1106
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,210
Lanny Morris.

1107
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,612
It's a Jewish name...

1108
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,286
...but I'm a nebbish.

1109
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,989
You ordered three bottle
of champagne.

1110
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,453
You want me to open one now?

1111
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,185
Or wait until friend come?

1112
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,820
Open all three.

1113
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,764
Are you really famous, Mr. Morris?

1114
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,630
In my day.

1115
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,131
Before your time, I suppose.

1116
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,701
I come from the north of Vietnam.

1117
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,243
In my town, there is no television.

1118
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:02,747
<i>She explained that American movies
had been banned where she grew up.</i>

1119
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,652
<i>She got better tips pretending
she was Madame Butterfly...</i>

1120
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,919
<i>...than by telling people
where she was really from.</i>

1121
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:17,156
What did you do, Mr. Morris?

1122
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,758
I made Vince Collins' life...

1123
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,296
...very difficult.

1124
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:26,702
<i>She didn't understand, but her policy
was not to linger in the rooms...</i>

1125
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,842
<i>...of solitary gentlemen.</i>

1126
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:34,545
<i>He signed the room-service check
under Lanny's name.</i>

1127
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,309
Thank you.

1128
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,640
<i>There was no ice or water
left in the buckets...</i>

1129
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,643
<i>...when his body was discovered
the next morning.</i>

1130
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,647
<i>He had dumped the ice into
the bathtub and died in it.</i>

1131
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,982
<i>He must have felt
there was some poetry in it.</i>

1132
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,760
<i>His plan was to drink
enough champagne...</i>

1133
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,362
<i>...with enough sleeping pills...</i>

1134
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:27,467
<i>...so that ending things would
become an acceptable idea.</i>

1135
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,103
<i>He could manage that.</i>

1136
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:34,239
<i>He knew for certain
he couldn't manage anything else.</i>

1137
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,371
Hi.

1138
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,346
I thought you were
gonna be out all afternoon.

1139
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,854
I'm sorry.

1140
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,158
It's okay.

1141
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:56,154
This was under the door.

1142
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,001
What is it?

1143
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,768
Chapter three.

1144
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:14,845
<i>John, as my lawyer, I want you
to know that this next chapter...</i>

1145
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,019
<i>...is to be read
after Vince and my death...</i>

1146
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:22,884
<i>...and is only to be used under
the most extreme of circumstances.</i>

1147
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,686
<i>We knew we wanted to make
an early night of it...</i>

1148
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:30,331
<i>...with the telethon starting the next
day, so Vince suggested we dine in...</i>

1149
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,524
<i>...so Maureen could do
the interview for her campus paper.</i>

1150
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:38,729
This is a gift for us
from the audience...

1151
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:43,310
...from the people,
the people that are out there.

1152
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:48,411
Sooner or later you gotta say,
"We wanna give something back. "

1153
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,275
I think that's really important.

1154
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:54,785
Not many people would take
the time out to do that. Thank you.

1155
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,720
<i>She actually hid her tape recorder
in the room-service cart...</i>

1156
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,690
<i>...because she didn't want
the hotel to find out.</i>

1157
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,734
<i>We finished the interview
and then asked her to stay.</i>

1158
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:18,871
<i>To help us get into the mood,
I did a Tuinal...</i>

1159
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,707
<i>...then she did one...</i>

1160
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:25,046
<i>...and Vince, he did two,
because he was always doing two.</i>

1161
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:29,880
<i>We got into the second of the
three bottles of Mot we'd ordered.</i>

1162
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:35,256
<i>We thought it would be better to keep
the action to neutral territory.</i>

1163
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,132
<i>God...</i>

1164
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:42,130
<i>...she was beautiful.</i>

1165
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,036
<i>I chain-locked the front door
to the living room...</i>

1166
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:50,769
<i>...to make sure that housekeeping,
eager to turn down our beds...</i>

1167
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,539
<i>...didn't walk in on an employee
having a mnage 'a trois...</i>

1168
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,841
<i>...with the hotel's headliners.</i>

1169
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,884
<i>Then I went to chain-lock
the door to Vince's room.</i>

1170
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,420
<i>I took a quick shower,
I put on my robe...</i>

1171
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:06,856
<i>...and brought a robe for Maureen,
in case she felt a little bashful.</i>

1172
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,763
<i>So much for bashful.</i>

1173
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,596
<i>I threw the robe on the bed
and moved into the room...</i>

1174
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,797
<i>...half-worried that they would
finish without me.</i>

1175
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,711
<i>I've always preferred
the missionary position.</i>

1176
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,581
<i>I have to see their faces,
look into their eyes.</i>

1177
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:37,986
<i>Unless they're acting, and I'd like
to think I can tell the difference...</i>

1178
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,252
<i>...there comes that moment...</i>

1179
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,487
<i>...when, if you're looking...</i>

1180
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:45,165
<i>...if you're really looking...</i>

1181
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,700
<i>...you'll see exactly who she is.</i>

1182
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,768
<i>This was different.</i>

1183
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:55,739
<i>It was like
she saw exactly who I was.</i>

1184
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,528
<i>Watch it there, compadre.</i>

1185
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:20,096
It's a little hard to tell who's who,
under the circumstances.

1186
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,703
I'm the one that's more than
a little hard, you dumb fucking limey.

1187
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,938
Well, I'm-I'm the one with a foreskin.
Don't you forget that.

1188
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,413
Watch it. You got the end zone
there, Vince.

1189
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,607
-Come on, come on. Fuck.
-You're gonna like it.

1190
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,911
It's like from another planet
when you come.

1191
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,917
-Get the fuck off me.
-I'd never hurt you.

1192
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,953
-I'd never hurt you.
-Get the fuck off me!

1193
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,389
-No, trust me. It's like double the sex-
-Get the fuck off me!

1194
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:49,085
We don't fuck, Vince!

1195
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:52,826
We're buddies, we're pals,
we're partners, we're a duo.

1196
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:56,265
We love each other,
but we don't fuck!

1197
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,335
We're fucking stars!

1198
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,940
-We can travel together.
-Okay.

1199
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:05,943
We can hang out together, we can live
together, but we can't be queers!

1200
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,139
It's not funny!

1201
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,134
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1202
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,809
About?

1203
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,038
About your nose.

1204
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,418
It's not broken, is it?

1205
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,545
It's how I am.

1206
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:52,488
Guess the question is,
who's gonna pay me?

1207
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,821
<i>This surprised me.</i>

1208
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,430
<i>The girl was not a hooker.</i>

1209
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,606
<i>My wallet was on top of my robe.</i>

1210
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,070
<i>I took out some money.</i>

1211
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,642
<i>I don't remember how much.</i>

1212
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,700
I don't think so.

1213
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,631
That's more than you would
make in a month of tips.

1214
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,137
I'm not looking for a tip.

1215
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,836
What the hell are you saying?

1216
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:45,410
Honey, I'm in my last year
of college.

1217
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,309
This is a summer job.

1218
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,421
I wanna write.

1219
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,181
I wanna be a journalist.

1220
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,722
So I could either
use this information...

1221
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,457
...or I could use a lot of money.

1222
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,635
I promise you
this will only cost you once.

1223
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:18,142
I'm so tired, I don't even think
I'm going home.

1224
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:20,808
I think it's the Tuinals.

1225
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:26,381
Hey, Lanny, don't take it personally.

1226
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,954
You were a great lover.

1227
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:32,593
You have got the cutest little butt.

1228
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,861
I guess Vince thinks so too.

1229
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,738
Night, Lanny.

1230
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,268
<i>I would never see her alive again.</i>

1231
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:57,081
<i>I put a "Do Not Disturb" sign
on my door...</i>

1232
01:25:57,285 --> 01:26:00,482
<i>...fastened the chain lock,
in case the maid didn't read.</i>

1233
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,622
<i>I left a wake-up call for 8...</i>

1234
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,258
<i>...and went to sleep
knowing that a telethon...</i>

1235
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,453
<i>...was the least of the ordeals I was
going to have to face in the morning.</i>

1236
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,299
<i>The Tuinals had really
conked me out...</i>

1237
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,632
<i>...and I slept through
my wake-up call that morning.</i>

1238
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,968
<i>The operator had called Reuben
down the hall...</i>

1239
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,872
<i>...to see if he could wake me...</i>

1240
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:27,275
<i>...but he couldn't get in because
we had chain-locked all the doors.</i>

1241
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,179
Reuben!

1242
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,252
<i>I yelled for Reuben to wake up Vince
while I worked on Maureen...</i>

1243
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:37,254
<i>...trying to make myself believe
that she was still sleeping.</i>

1244
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,361
Fuck.

1245
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:43,423
No, no. Fuck.

1246
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,123
<i>The autopsy revealed the drugs
and alcohol in her body...</i>

1247
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:50,031
<i>...but I knew
it wasn't enough to kill her.</i>

1248
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,005
<i>All three doors to the suite...</i>

1249
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,772
<i>...were chain-locked from the inside
when I found her.</i>

1250
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,645
<i>I hadn't touched her.</i>

1251
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:07,947
<i>That's how I know that my former
partner and friend, Vince Collins...</i>

1252
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:11,387
<i>...murdered Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1253
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,593
<i>You must have guessed by now
that Vince and I had found a way...</i>

1254
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,792
<i>...to relocate Maureen's body
to New Jersey.</i>

1255
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:25,530
<i>This is the one criminal act
the both of us committed...</i>

1256
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:30,302
<i>...but we were in a panic and
needed to create an ironclad alibi.</i>

1257
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:33,002
<i>The crates were delivered
to our room.</i>

1258
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,910
<i>The publicist had opened the crates
for a photo op.</i>

1259
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,641
<i>But the official story became...</i>

1260
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:40,514
<i>...that she found Maureen's
overdosed body in the tub.</i>

1261
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:44,715
<i>A police officer called Scaglia
was there to witness the whole thing.</i>

1262
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,951
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

1263
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,526
<i>During the telethon...</i>

1264
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:52,757
<i>...I kept telling myself that I could
forgive Vince for two reasons.</i>

1265
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,868
<i>First of all, I don't think he could
have known what he was doing.</i>

1266
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:59,403
<i>He was completely out of it,
even more than usual.</i>

1267
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,472
<i>The second is that he was terrified...</i>

1268
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,804
<i>...that this incident would become
public knowledge.</i>

1269
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:08,676
<i>In those days, the slightest hint
that he could swing both ways...</i>

1270
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:12,444
<i>...would destroy his
show-business career in an instant.</i>

1271
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,222
<i>As it was, it was only to destroy us.</i>

1272
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:18,883
<i>We completed the telethon...</i>

1273
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:21,687
<i>...but we both knew
we were finished.</i>

1274
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,896
<i>The marriage...</i>

1275
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,094
<i>...was over.</i>

1276
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:30,298
<i>There was a moment
in the middle of the telethon...</i>

1277
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,099
<i>...where I actually broke down.</i>

1278
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,471
<i>I just couldn't control myself.</i>

1279
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:39,169
<i>I remember I mumbled something...</i>

1280
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,874
<i>...to a little girl who was recounting
her experiences with the disease.</i>

1281
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,919
<i>I don't remember what I said...</i>

1282
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:50,221
<i>...but I do remember
feeling worthless.</i>

1283
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:54,657
<i>Everyone thought that my tears
were for her.</i>

1284
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:58,362
<i>It made for a great picture
in the papers the next day.</i>

1285
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,567
Mr. Morris will see you now.

1286
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:30,157
I expected to see you
at Vince's funeral.

1287
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:35,832
kind of heartless of you not to
show up, don't you think, karen?

1288
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:39,399
Considering you're probably
the one that...

1289
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,840
...drove him to it.

1290
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,004
I won't answer that.

1291
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,378
So don't.

1292
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,549
So get the fuck out of my office.

1293
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:57,987
Lanny, I have interview material with
Vince up until the moment he met you.

1294
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,353
It would be great if this...

1295
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,255
...warm, funny side of Vince
could reach the public.

1296
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:07,025
And what the fuck do you know
about Vince's warm and funny side?

1297
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,929
What about the warm and funny fact
that he killed himself?

1298
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,604
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

1299
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,475
That's the answer I'm giving you...

1300
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,773
...and anyone else that asks.

1301
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,043
-"I don't know. "
-But you do know, don't you, Lanny?

1302
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,312
Whatever I know, sweetheart...

1303
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:28,819
...I'm writing in my book.

1304
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:33,257
Except you're never
going to finish your book.

1305
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,286
You don't have to.

1306
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,332
The person who needed
your book is dead.

1307
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:41,969
You always wrote the material
for your shows.

1308
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,001
Every single word was rehearsed.

1309
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,673
The book was a manual,
a set of notes...

1310
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,707
...so Vince would get
every detail of the official story.

1311
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:53,506
"A couple of extra babes for him
to sleep with that night.

1312
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:55,682
A few of them on hand.

1313
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:58,647
Well, not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference. "

1314
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:03,381
-So, what's your point?
-He quoted that very line to me.

1315
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:07,789
Quoted it from your manuscript as if
he were saying it for the first time.

1316
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,363
You wrote it because you loved him.

1317
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,397
And feared for him.

1318
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:22,834
And feared for yourself.

1319
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:29,682
And then you wrote this:

1320
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,723
Where the fuck did you get that?

1321
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,449
-Delivered to my room.
-Bullshit. You stole it.

1322
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:43,960
Maureen O'Flaherty was killed
in the Versailles Hotel, in your room...

1323
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,725
...the night before the telethon.

1324
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,502
The night before we met.

1325
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:00,072
Get out of my office.

1326
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,360
Miss Trout?

1327
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:54,559
<i>We walked through the deserted
backlot of the studio...</i>

1328
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:59,035
<i>...and I confessed
that I wasn't Bonnie Trout.</i>

1329
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,333
<i>That I was writing a book
about Vince Collins.</i>

1330
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,669
<i>And that I was trying
to uncover the secret...</i>

1331
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,210
<i>...behind what happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1332
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:09,172
<i>I told him what I found out.</i>

1333
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:11,010
<i>He prayed that he would
be forgiven...</i>

1334
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,516
<i>...for having been there
as the murder was concealed.</i>

1335
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,416
Miss O'Connor...

1336
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:19,682
...I have a tape recording of
the night Miss O'Flaherty was killed.

1337
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:23,491
She had brought a machine.

1338
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,624
-For the interview.
-Yes.

1339
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:30,929
I found it as I was
getting rid of her things.

1340
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:35,335
She kept it on?

1341
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:40,136
Could you use this tape
for your book?

1342
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:45,945
Of course.

1343
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:48,248
Miss O'Connor...

1344
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:51,021
...is it something...?

1345
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:53,725
Oh, my.

1346
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,953
Is it something I could sell?

1347
01:33:56,998 --> 01:34:00,092
Reuben, I can't speak
on behalf of my publishers...

1348
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,861
...but I'm sure that we can
settle on a price.

1349
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,436
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Connor.

1350
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,770
<i>I'll even spice it up a little,
talk about how...</i>

1351
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:15,005
<i>...the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe.</i>

1352
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:17,946
So to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1353
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:20,350
Well, not exactly on my hand.

1354
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:23,853
That's not my preference,
as you may have gathered by now.

1355
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,722
I need the money.

1356
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,326
Did you have a figure in mind?

1357
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:37,563
Would you think a million dollars
would be too much?

1358
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:42,374
Vince was being paid
a million dollars for his life.

1359
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:43,873
This is one night.

1360
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:46,870
The most important night.

1361
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:50,306
<i>You could have left me a note
or called me.</i>

1362
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,214
<i>-I did leave you a note.
-Where?</i>

1363
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:05,227
Lanny left this for me
at my apartment.

1364
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,995
It's his version
of what happened that night.

1365
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:14,068
On its own,
it's absolutely useless to me.

1366
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:16,641
I could have typed it myself.

1367
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:24,575
But if it matched
what's recorded on your tape...

1368
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,117
...it would make it priceless.

1369
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:35,961
Which is why you sent it to me.

1370
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:42,027
You just said
Mr. Morris left it at your apartment.

1371
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,670
He was surprised I had it.

1372
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:50,368
Like he was surprised I hadn't found
the note he left for me at the hotel.

1373
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,308
The note you must've disposed of
as you were tidying the room.

1374
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:55,641
I told you how he deals with women.
I was afraid.

1375
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,613
<i>Really afraid of what
he might do to you.</i>

1376
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,945
<i>Maybe you were afraid of what I'd-</i>

1377
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,645
I'd do to him. And to you.

1378
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:06,759
Why would I be afraid of
a schoolteacher called Bonnie Trout?

1379
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:09,521
Because you knew I was
karen O'Connor.

1380
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,460
When I woke up,
you folded my clothes...

1381
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:14,566
...and placed my pocketbook
on the bed.

1382
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,762
The pocketbook that had my name
and the letter from my publisher.

1383
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,773
I was writing about the one thing
you wanted to have total control over:

1384
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:25,969
Collins and Morris.

1385
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:31,577
You made me abandon any thought
of trying to contact Lanny.

1386
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,586
You made me feel like I was
less than nothing to him...

1387
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,950
...because you were playing
your own complex game.

1388
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:42,858
And what exactly was this complex
game I was playing, Miss O'Connor?

1389
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,143
You were in the room.

1390
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,214
That night.

1391
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:09,650
Lanny had a robe.
He dropped it on the bed.

1392
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:12,451
After Maureen asked for money...

1393
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,628
...the wallet was on top.
It had been folded.

1394
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:18,321
Well, I always, always arranged
Mr. Morris' things.

1395
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:21,797
After he went to bed.
You were there before.

1396
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:25,199
How would I get out?
All three doors were chain-locked.

1397
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,719
Through Vince's room.

1398
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,719
Then, the next morning...

1399
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,228
<i>...you must have chain-locked the
door before you went to wake him up.</i>

1400
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:58,464
Fuck!

1401
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,942
Lanny let me read the first chapter.

1402
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,476
Vince sent me the second.

1403
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,948
And you stole this.

1404
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:12,550
To whet my appetite.

1405
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:38,806
<i>I wanna write.</i>

1406
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:40,913
<i>I wanna be a journalist.</i>

1407
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:44,608
<i>So I could either
use this information...</i>

1408
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:47,443
<i>...or I could use a lot of money.</i>

1409
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:50,021
Is that why you killed her?

1410
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:52,554
To protect them?

1411
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,768
<i>For 15 years...</i>

1412
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:07,031
<i>...he tormented Vince and Lanny.</i>

1413
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:14,308
<i>He could never blackmail Vince
while Sally Sanmarco was alive...</i>

1414
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:19,584
<i>...so he waited until Sally died
to activate his retirement plan:</i>

1415
01:39:22,189 --> 01:39:25,249
<i>A million dollars from Vince.</i>

1416
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:30,360
<i>A million dollars for the same tape
he offered to me.</i>

1417
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:39,137
<i>He would never get his money,
and I would never see him again.</i>

1418
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,807
<i>He had taken her life...</i>

1419
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:50,779
<i>...and with it her mother's heart...</i>

1420
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:53,750
<i>...and her father's mind.</i>

1421
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:56,879
<i>And now...</i>

1422
01:39:57,091 --> 01:40:00,322
<i>...all that remained
of Maureen O'Flaherty...</i>

1423
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:04,554
<i>...was a tree
in her mother's garden.</i>

1424
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:22,544
Your daughter learned something
about Vince Collins...

1425
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,378
...that he didn't want anyone to know.

1426
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:27,347
Because of that...

1427
01:40:27,554 --> 01:40:29,112
...she was killed.

1428
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:32,486
If it's of any small comfort,
she probably didn't suffer.

1429
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:36,688
I want people
to know about this man.

1430
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:40,095
I want them to know
why he killed her.

1431
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:47,600
There is someone in all this...

1432
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:49,901
...who is totally innocent
of any involvement...

1433
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:52,010
...in the events of that night...

1434
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:57,047
...but whose life will be made infinitely
worse if I tell the truth at this time.

1435
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:01,612
I wanna protect this person
from any further pain.

1436
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:06,626
I promise you-

1437
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:10,686
I promise you I will write down
the truth that I've learned...

1438
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:13,890
...but I have to let matters lie
until this person has died...

1439
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:16,296
...and the truth
can no longer touch them.

1440
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:24,602
<i>I saw no indication on her face...</i>

1441
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:27,372
<i>...that she knew
I was talking about her.</i>

1442
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:03,742
You're a very special girl.

1443
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:14,360
Forgive me.
