1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,460
He's definitely got the inside track.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,220
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,940
<i>Really? Are they looking into...</i>

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,460
<i>...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,980
<i>Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.</i>

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,020
<i>They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,820
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,340
<i>Who do you like?</i>

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,060
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,860
<i>And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,460
<i>...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...</i>

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>- ...possible Los Angeles.
- Could be a dark horse.</i>

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,340
<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,620
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.</i>

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,660
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,460
<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.</i>

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,060
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,860
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:07,140
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,140
Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,140
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,020
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,580
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,020
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,820
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,820
In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,140
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,620
Um, I'm not... l find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,260
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,340
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,980
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,500
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,980
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,780
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,660
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,980
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,820
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,580
What you see? What you see?

42
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,860
Damn.

43
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,020
Let's go, Sam.

44
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,420
Come on.

45
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,740
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

46
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,300
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

47
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,820
<i>...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

48
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>...to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

49
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,780
<i>Here you go. Just the way you like it.</i>

50
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,020
Disgusting.

51
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,420
Excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,540
All right. Come on, relax.

53
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,980
Planes, trains and automobiles.

54
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,420
<i>There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.</i>

55
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,380
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

56
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
There you go.

57
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,100
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.</i>

58
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,780
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

59
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,820
<i>In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

60
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,420
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

61
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,980
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

62
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,020
<i>- And then it turns brown.
COURIC: If that.</i>

63
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,740
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

64
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,380
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

65
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,660
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

66
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,300
<i>Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...</i>

67
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,340
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

68
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,380
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

69
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,820
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

70
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,820
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

71
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,740
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

72
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Deal? Deal?

73
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,260
Come on.

74
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,260
<i>♪ Don't worry about a thing ♪</i>

75
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,500
<i>♪ 'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right ♪</i>

76
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,860
I know that feels good.

77
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,580
<i>♪ Smiled with the rising sun

78
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,980
Ah, Sam.

79
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,980
<i>♪ Singin' sweet songs
Of melody... ♪</i>

80
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,980
I'm all right.

81
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm all right, it's all right.

82
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,220
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

83
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,180
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

84
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,900
- Can't get used to the new regs.
- Going to Aunt Sara's.

85
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,820
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

86
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,980
- We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

87
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,900
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

88
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,980
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

89
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,980
- Did you bring all the money?
- Yeah.

90
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,500
- How much?
- Six hundred.

91
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,940
Why did you say, "You're going"?

92
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,460
- That's not enough.
- Robert.

93
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,580
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."

94
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,660
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

95
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,580
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

96
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,860
Bring enough food for two weeks.

97
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,540
<i>Jesus, Robert, did it jump?</i>

98
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,420
Is it airborne?

99
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,540
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

100
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,540
- It may be.
- Oh, my God.

101
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,420
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

102
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,980
Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...

103
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,060
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

104
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Hush now, Mar.

105
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,180
<i>Threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation...</i>

106
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,620
- Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
- Marley, enough!

107
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,300
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

108
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,300
<i>...that tonight I have signed
an executive order...</i>

109
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,700
<i>...initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.</i>

110
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,860
<i>God be with us.</i>

111
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>This has been a special...</i>

112
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,780
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

113
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,460
...we can reverse the spread.

114
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,860
I can still fix this.

115
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,820
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

116
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,780
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

117
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,620
What are you doing?

118
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,980
What am I doing?

119
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,340
I'm not gonna let this happen.

120
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,380
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control...

121
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,420
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

122
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,980
How'd you sleep?

123
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,260
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

124
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,940
Uh-uh.

125
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,700
I'll be back.

126
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,620
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

127
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,820
Animal trials. Streaming video.

128
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,380
GA series results appear typical.

129
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,860
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

130
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,380
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

131
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,460
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

132
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,860
...12, 13, 15, 17...

133
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,460
...all killed the host.

134
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,300
Hold on a second.

135
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,980
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

136
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,300
Partial pigmentation return.

137
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Slight pupil constriction.

138
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,900
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

139
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
...next candidate for human trials.

140
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,820
You hang in there, number six.

141
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,940
Yeah, that's what you want.

142
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,700
Hey!

143
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,740
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

144
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,500
What are you guys doing here so early?

145
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,260
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

146
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,420
I'll see you guys inside.

147
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,980
What's happening, buddy?

148
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,740
Yes.

149
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,940
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.

150
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,980
Hey, who's the girl in...?

151
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,540
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

152
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,100
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

153
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,460
"Hello.

154
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,180
Wanna see some infected rats?"

155
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,180
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

156
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,100
Psst.

157
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,260
Come here. Hey. Hey.

158
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,500
Good job. You did so good.

159
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Yes. Yes.

160
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,860
Ah.

161
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,180
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

162
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,580
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

163
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,740
You'll get some of that later.

164
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's go.

165
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,820
Wait.

166
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,620
My name is Robert Neville.

167
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,460
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

169
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,820
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

170
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,060

171
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,020
<i>If you are out there...</i>

172
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,860
<i>If anyone is out there...</i>

173
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,300
<i>I can provide food.</i>

174
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,180
<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

175
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,180

176
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,780
<i>If there's anybody out there...</i>

177
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,700
<i>...anybody...</i>

178
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,020
<i>Please.</i>

179
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,940
<i>You are not alone.</i>

180
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,300
Fore!

181
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,860
Yeah.

182
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,380
Keep your eye on this one for me.

183
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
Ooh.

184
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,500
I'm getting good.

185
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,540
Ss-ss.

186
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,940
Sam! No, no, no!

187
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,460
No! No! Sam!

188
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,380
No! No!

189
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,900
Sam? Sam? Sam?

190
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,660
Sam? Sam?

191
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,020
Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Hello, Sam?

193
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,020
Sam?

194
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,980
Sam?

195
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,820
Come on. Sam.

196
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,260
I gotta go, Sam.

197
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,580
I gotta go. I gotta go.

198
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,140
Sam?

199
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,700
Sam? Sam?

200
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,380
Sam? Sam?

201
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,460
Sam. Sam.

202
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,260
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

203
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,820
What are you doing?

204
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,180
Sam, we gotta go!

205
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,940
Sam, go! Go!

206
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,420
Sam, get out! Get out!

207
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,260
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

208
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,060
Listen, uh...

209
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,140
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

210
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,300
Because you can still get infected.

211
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,900
And I can't.

212
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,900
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

213
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,980
...just go.

214
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:38,540
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

215
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,020
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

216
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,060
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

217
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,380
Respiration elevated.

218
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,420
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

219
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,220
Pupils fully dilated.

220
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,700
Nonreactive to light.

221
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,100
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

222
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,940
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

223
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,940
Vaccine test.

224
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,380
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

225
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,700
Commencing human trials.

226
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,620
Respiration slowing.

227
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,820
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

228
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,540
...105...

229
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,180
...104 and decreasing.

230
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,260
We may have something here.

231
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,900
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

232
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,220
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

233
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Still no cure.

234
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,780
<i>Day 1001.</i>

235
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,100
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

236
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,020
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

237
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,940
...and contact strains.

238
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,980
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

239
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,340
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

240
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,140
Vaccine trials continue.

241
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,340
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

242
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,820
The Krippin Virus is...

243
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
...elegant.

244
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,140
<i>Just fishing in the dark, son.</i>

245
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,020
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

246
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,500
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

247
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,500
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

248
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,780
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

249
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,860
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

250
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,260
Social de-evolution appears complete.

251
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,700
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

252
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,060
Why are we stopping?

253
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,580
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

254
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,020
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

255
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,620
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
- Daddy!

256
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,100
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

257
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,940
MIKE: Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

258
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,500
Mommy, they have guns!

259
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,660
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

260
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,940
Unless you have clearance...

261
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,540
<i>...you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

262
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,100
MIKE: Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

263
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,740
Coming through!

264
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,740
<i>Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.</i>

265
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,980
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

266
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,020
You're clear. Move ahead.

267
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
You're clear.

268
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,220
All right, that's it, move up.

269
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,780
All right, step up.

270
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,540
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

271
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,180
No good.

272
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,380
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

273
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,500
Come on, step back.

274
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,500
<i>- Military quarantine is about to begin.
- Look, look, look.</i>

275
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,620
- I'm not infected.
- Clear. Good, go on.

276
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,900
I'm not infected.

277
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,500
Please! Please!

278
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,420
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
- You're gonna have to move back.

279
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,940
- No good.
- Follow me, ma'am.

280
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,460
What? No! Robert! Robert!

281
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,820
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

282
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,340
- Mommy!
MIKE: Stand down.

283
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,540
Lieutenant...

284
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,380
- Mommy!
- Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

285
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,020
Get your hands off of my wife.

286
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,540
MIKE: Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!

287
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,300
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

288
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,060
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

289
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,940
Scan her again!

290
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,540
All right, scan her again.

291
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,340
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.

292
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,900
Who's next? Come on.

293
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,940
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

294
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,340
- Mommy!
- Please take my baby. Please!

295
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,540
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

296
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,260
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

297
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,100
How long?

298
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,540
Five minutes. We'll make it.

299
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,860
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

300
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,620
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

301
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,700
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

302
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,180
Give me a kiss.

303
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,340
I love you. I love you.

304
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,940
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

305
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,420
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

306
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,620
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

307
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,620
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

308
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,100
Sam, you protect Daddy.

309
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,220
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
- Sir, we gotta go!

310
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,340
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

311
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,260
It's a butterfly.

312
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,820
All right, come on, let's go!

313
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,700
How'd you sleep?

314
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,020
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

315
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,100
<i>...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

316
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,380
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

317
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,380
<i>...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

318
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,380
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

319
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,740
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

320
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,860
<i>...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

321
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,580
It's my birthday.

322
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,100
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these...</i>

323
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,980
You gonna sing?

324
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,340
My name is Robert Neville.

325
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,100

<i>You are not alone.</i>

Listen, uh...

336
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,180
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

337
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,220
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.

338
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,020
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

339
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,780
Hey! Hey!

340
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,980
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

341
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,700
What the...? What the hell are you...?
No!

342
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,580
No! No!

343
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,100
No.

344
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,140
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

345
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,780
How did you get out here?!

346
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,020
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

347
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,660
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

348
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,740
Damn it, Fred!

349
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Damn it!

350
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,180
I'm all right.
I'm all right, I'm all right.

351
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,860
I'm all right.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

352
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,860
Baby. I'm okay.

353
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,980
I'm okay. I'm okay.

354
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,340
Let's go.

355
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,460
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

356
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,020
Let's go! Sam!

357
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,060
No! No! Let's go!

358
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,940
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

359
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,180
Sam!

360
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,460
No!

361
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,540
Sam? Sam?

362
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,700
It's okay.

363
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,940
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

364
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,580
You're all right. You're all right.

365
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,740
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

366
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,140
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

367
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,460
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.

368
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,220
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

369
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,860
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,300
Come on. Come here. Come here.

371
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,900
I got you. I got you.

372
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,660
It's okay.

373
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,300
You're okay.

I promised my friend...

382
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:07,020
...that I would say hello to you today.

383
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,460
Hello.

384
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,900
Hello.

385
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,180
Please say hello to me.

386
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,820
Please say hello to me.

387
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,860
Die!

388
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,260
Die!

389
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,020
Die!

390
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:08,420
Come on! Stay with me!

391
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,500
Where do you live?

392
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,220
Hey.

393
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,220
Hey!

394
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,500
Stay with me.

395
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,700
Where do you live?

396
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,180
Where do you live?

397
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,180
Uh...

398
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,580
11 Washington Square.

399
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,860
They don't know where I live.

400
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,220
Don't... Don't let them track us.

401
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,180
You gotta stay out till dawn.

402
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,060
No!

403
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,540
Donkey?

404
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:56,620
<i>What are you doing?</i>

405
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,140
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

406
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,060
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

407
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,220
<i>It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

408
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,940
<i>- Oh, your half? Hm.
- Yes, my half.</i>

409
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,740
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

410
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,260
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

411
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,580
<i>- Back off!
- No, you back off.</i>

412
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,820
<i>- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.</i>

413
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,460
<i>- Smelly ogre.
- Fine!</i>

414
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,900
<i>Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

415
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,540
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

416
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,820
<i>You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me. "</i>

417
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:42,060
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

418
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,420
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

419
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,980
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

420
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,500
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

421
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,860
<i>Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

422
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,900
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

423
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,420
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

424
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,060
<i>...for stabbing me in the back!</i>

425
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,900
<i>You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

426
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,260
<i>- Go away.
- See?</i>

427
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,540
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

428
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,940
<i>...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

429
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,580
<i>Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

430
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,380
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

431
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,380
<i>She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

432
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,900
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

433
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,100
Obviously you know that.

434
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,140
They're yours.

435
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:48,340
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

436
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:52,300
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

437
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,820
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

438
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:59,220
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

439
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,300
Who are you?

440
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,340
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

441
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,540
Don't let it get cold.

442
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,260
It's okay. Go on.

443
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,500
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

444
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,260
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

445
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,700
We're going to Vermont.

446
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,060
To the survivors' colony.

447
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,220
What?

448
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,780
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

449
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,420
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

450
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,460
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

451
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,700
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

452
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:30,460
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

453
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,180
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony...

454
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,580
Shut up! Shut up!

455
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,180
Everybody's dead.

456
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,460
Everybody is dead.

457
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,500
I just need...
l need a minute. Okay?

458
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,660
<i>Just...</i>

459
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,460
I just... l was saving that bacon.

460
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,340
I was saving it.

461
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,660
<i>I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just...</i>

462
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,820
I'm gonna go.

463
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,580
Ethan, put the knife down.

464
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,540
Aye.

465
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,860
<i>By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

466
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,420
<i>...I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

467
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:21,420
<i>...and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

468
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:25,940
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

469
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,900
Can I say something to you?

470
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,060
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

471
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,420
Are you talking to...

472
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,580
...me?

473
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,260
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

474
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,660
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

475
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,100
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

476
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,300
That really made me
feel good to see that.

477
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,700
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

478
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,980
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

479
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,660
Hm?

480
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,260
But, uh...

481
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,060
...I don't have any friends.

482
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,700
And I'm not going out there by myself.

483
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,500
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

484
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,420
<i>You a mean, green fighting machine.</i>

485
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,700
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

486
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,220
<i>I like Shrek.</i>

487
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,820
<i>That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

488
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,700
<i>...if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

489
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,820
<i>...because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

490
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,460
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

491
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,540
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

492
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,540
Thank you for my leg.

493
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,820
Okay.

494
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,420
Where have you been?

495
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,220
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Säo Paulo.

496
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,500
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

497
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,220
No, they weren't.

498
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,380
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

499
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,340
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

500
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,140
You said five?

501
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,220
The Darkseekers got them.

502
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,220
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

503
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,420
It's too late today.

504
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,700
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

505
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,340
- So if you had...
- I'm not leaving.

506
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,540
This is ground zero.

507
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,140
This is my site.

508
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,300
I'm not gonna let this happen.

509
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,780
I can still fix this.

510
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,540
What happened to your leg?

511
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,140
That's my snare.
These are my materials.

512
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,340
The infected didn't do this. They can't.

513
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,180
- How do you know?
- They have no higher brain function.

514
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,620
They don't plan or hate.
They don't love. They can't.

515
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,820
Could they be evolving?

516
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,100
Ethan.

517
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,820
Hey, Ethan.

518
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,340
It's cold.

519
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,180
We gotta go.

520
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,860
- I've been cooking the compounds.
- What?

521
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,460
Ice. I need ice.

522
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,620
- Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.

523
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,140
I called down twice.

524
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,940
Oh. Oh, thank you.

525
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,220
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

526
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,140
I've never seen one so still.

527
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,420
They're always biting.

528
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,780
You think that can cure her?

529
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,900
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

530
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,300
...but it's possible by drastically
reducing the body temperature...

531
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,460
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

532
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,020
Did all of them die?

533
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,820
Yes.

534
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,900
My God.

535
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:25,500
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

536
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,140
Where can Ethan sleep?

537
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,700
He's heavy.

538
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,020
Can you get that?

539
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,100
She's beautiful.

540
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,500
What's her name?

541
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,100
Marley.

542
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,940
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

543
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,860
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

544
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,380
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.

545
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,140
Damian?

546
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,420
Uh, his father.

547
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,980
His father.

548
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,180
Nope.

549
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,460
<i>♪ I shot the sheriff ♪</i>

550
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,740
<i>♪ But I didn't shoot the deputy ♪</i>

551
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:31,260
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

552
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,420
Best album ever made.

553
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,820
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

554
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,380
Wow.

555
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:01,100
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

556
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,900
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

557
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:12,220
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

558
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:16,940
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

559
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,060
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

560
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,220
Two days later...

561
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,500
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

562
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,700
Somebody asked him why.

563
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,980
He said, "The people...

564
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:42,220
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

565
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,380
How can I?"

566
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,300
Light up the darkness.

567
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,540
Come with us, Neville.

568
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,140
To the colony.

569
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,300
There's no colony, Anna.

570
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,140
Everything just fell apart.

571
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,980
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.

572
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,580
I know, okay?

573
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,260
How do you know, Anna?

574
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,860
I just know.

575
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:57,260
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

576
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,300
God told me.

577
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,780
He has a plan.

578
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,140
- God told you?
- Yes.

579
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,020
- The God?
- Yes.

580
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:14,020
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

581
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,020
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

582
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,820
Something told me to come here.

583
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,780
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

584
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,980
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

585
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Anna.

586
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,500
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

587
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,300
<i>- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.</i>

588
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,500
Neville, the world is quieter now.

589
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,740
You just have to listen.

590
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,060
If we listen...

591
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,700
...we can hear God's plan.

592
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,940
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

593
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,660
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

594
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,740
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

595
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:57,500
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

596
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,140
...people dead.

597
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,140
Crashed and bled out, dead.

598
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,180
Less than 1 percent immunity.

599
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,140
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

600
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:13,460
The other 588 million...

601
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,620
...turned into your Darkseekers.

602
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,500
And then they got hungry.

603
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:22,060
And they killed and fed on everybody.

604
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,340
Everybody!

605
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:31,020
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

606
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,100
...is dead!

607
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,340
Dead!

608
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,420
There is no God. There is no God.

609
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,580
What is that?

610
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,220
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

611
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,500
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

612
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,820
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

613
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,540
They followed us home.

614
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,340
Ethan.

615
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,180
Shit.

616
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,540
Anna.

617
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,900
Anna.

618
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,300
Anna!

619
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,860
Anna!

620
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,860
Anna!

621
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,900
Anna?

622
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,620
Anna.

623
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,700
Come on. Come on.

624
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,700
- Are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

625
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,380
Are you all right?

626
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,420
- You okay?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

627
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,420
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

628
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,460
Get to the lab! To the lab!

629
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,860
Get behind the Plexi.

630
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,340
Oh, my God. Come on.

631
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,700
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

632
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,260
Oh, my God.

633
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:49,740
It's working.

634
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,460
Neville...

635
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,580
...it's working.

636
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,660
No! Stop! Stop!

637
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:09,260
Look, look, look, I can save you.

638
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:12,900
I can sa... I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

639
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,980
I can... I can fix this!

640
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,700
I can save everybody!

641
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:23,100
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

642
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,780
Stop! Stop!

643
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:37,340
Let me save you! Let me save you!

644
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,500
No, no!

645
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,660
No, no!

646
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,860
<i>Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.</i>

647
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,860
Robert.

648
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,980
What are you doing?

649
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,340
Open the door, please.

650
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,820
What are you doing?

651
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,500
I'm listening.

652
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,140
Shh, shh, shh...

653
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,180
Don't look.

654
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,740
I need to get a syringe.

655
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,700
I'm sorry.

656
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,060
Shh, shh, shh...

657
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,700
My name is Anna Montez.

658
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,220
<i>There are other survivors.</i>

659
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:51,620
<i>I am traveling with Dr. Robert Neville
and a boy named Ethan.</i>

660
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:56,700
<i>We're heading north on Route 17
to Bethel, Vermont.</i>

661
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:01,900
<i>Keep your radio on.
Listen for our broadcasts.</i>

662
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:04,940
<i>You are not alone.</i>

663
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,180
<i>There is hope.</i>

664
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,540
<i>Keep listening.</i>

665
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,700
<i>You are not alone.</i>
