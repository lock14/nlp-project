The only wonder of the world
seen from outer space...
...is the Great Wall of China.
The sole purpose of building the wall
was to protect the land.
The enemy kept coming.
He fought on bravely.
The greatest warrior of China:
Liu Sheng.
Today the wall is for tourists.
The spirit of warriors
lies frozen in statues.
But the enemy returns.
Hojo.
The evil Hojo has the village Zhange
in his grip.
He knows riches worth millions
are hidden here.
He sells their treasures to foreigners.
Sure. I'll talk to Dad about the shipment.
You Lazy dog.
Go. Or your son dies!
Hojo 's treacherous games
brought ruin to the villagers...
...and death too.
They were helpless.
In times of trouble,
even the blind look to God.
But help only comes
to the drowning man...
...if he reaches out for it.
The villagers sought a guiding light
to brighten their dark days.
The key to their survival lay in their past.
Their centuries-old protector
had returned.
He was born again: Liu Sheng.
Born in another form and country...
... their protector awaits them.
You smile?.
You're done for.
Where to?. You're Lunch.
I spent 100 rupees on five Lottery tickets.
Only one. Let me win.
Can't you help me?.
You do nothing all day!
Oh, God.
My winning Lottery ticket is burning.
Keep it then!
You insult me.
You tell people they were royalty
in a previous lifetime.
And me?. A mosquito?.
Shut up. You burping toad.
Do you know who I am?.
Chopstick.
The only Fung Shastra master in the world.
Get it?.
A Master of Feng Shui and Vastu Shastra.
I get it. Indian noodles. Chinese curry.
Put it down.
I'm the only mosquito I know
who works like a dog.
Shut up.
Here. See this lucky amulet?.
It'll change your fate.
It has the mighty power of Fung Shastra.
It's yours. How much have you got?.
How much?.
I'll check.
Two rupees.
-Damn. Give it to me.
-Will my luck turn?.
Fool. Wear it and see.
You'll be flying like a king.
Dada, if I were a big shot,
you'd have no food on your menu.
Thanks to you,
my restaurant survives. Right?.
Or I'd be begging at Jama Mosque.
I know.
You know nothing. If I had worn the amulet,
who knows what I'd be today.
Sidhu, you're naive.
Don't get conned by those work-shy fools.
Destiny isn't in your palm.
It's in hard work.
Hard work makes sweat. Not money.
I need to get lucky to have money.
Hard work will bring luck.
Don't take it out on him.
Stand on your own feet.
Stop cooking dreams.
No miracles will strike.
How can a miracle strike?.
I never wore the amulet.
Dada. Lord Ganesh has appeared
in a potato. A miracle.
Long live Lord Ganesh
Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva
The charity box is there.
It's not Sidhu's. It's Chopstick's cash box.
Long live bank notes.
Why did Lord Ganesh choose to appear
in a potato?.
Mysterious are the ways of God.
Pay your respects and move on.
Four hundred and ten, 420 rupees.
Pay protection money. Out with it.
Don't pull his hand away
or he'll rip my cheek.
Easy.
Cool air, please.
Dada.
I knew Lord Ganesh
would send you in good time.
Long live Lord Ganesh.
No, Dada.
Easy. You can't make an omelet
without eggs.
Bring the bride here.
He shows up here too. The moron.
Dada.
Remember, Dada.
You won't find another vegetable cutter
like me in Chandni Chowk.
I make the best curry. Mughalai....
Where is he?.
Chinese?.
He's Chinese too?.
He needs to know
he's Liu Sheng. Reborn.
Tell him he's the warrior Liu Sheng.
He must destroy Hojo. Destroy Hojo.
Only Liu Sheng can kill him.
Hojo has taken control of our village.
Hojo decapitates our men.
We have found you at last.
You must destroy Hojo.
How do I explain to them?.
They mistake a toothpick for an arrow.
Chopstick. Good fortune comes from China
and you show it a "Do Not Disturb" sign?.
If you tell Sidhu they want him to kill
an evil enemy, he'll never go to China.
Don't lie, Chopstick. He may amount
to nothing, but spare his life.
Give him a break. He'll love you for it.
What if Hojo drinks his blood?.
Your Chinese ancestors are calling you.
Go to China with him. And get rich.
No.
Don't listen.
Walk the path of truth.
Truth?. It will mislead you.
Why look from left to right?.
Are they speaking Sindhi?.
What's "Dado Hojo"?.
Your plans will go kaput if you tell him
it means "Kill Hojo." Wing it.
Dado Hojo means "the cool one."
You're cool too.
But they said a lot more.
What did they say?.
They said Lord Ganesh has blessed you.
His blessings have changed your future.
And your past.
You were no fish, fly or flea
in a previous birth.
You were a great and fearless
Chinese king.
-Liu Sheng.
-Liu Sheng.
Dado Hojo.
I'm going from Chandni Chowk to China!
Hello, boys.
She has the curves
She has heart
A chance for romance
Come, baby, let's dance
But Baby can 't dance
The new baby in the town
Dreams of dating the DJ
But Baby can 't dance
But Baby can 't dance
But Baby can 't dance
I will never dance well.
I don't want to live anymore.
Give me poison.
Don 't despair.
You don 't need poison.
You need Dance Master G9.
Dance Master G9?.
Yes! Dance Master G9.
A new Chinese gadget.
Tie it to your ankles.
Press a button and dance.
Bhangra to Beyonce. Dance!
Keep your husbands from bar girls.
Do the dancing yourself!
Buy Dance Master G9.
I am Miss TSM.
Cool, sexy, confident, glam.
That's me.
Thanks to Dance Master G9.
You want to shine like me?.
Order Dance Master G9.
Master!
Can I find a girl like her in China?.
Join the line for a Chinese visa.
Who cares if you're Miss TSM?.
Tell your sob story to someone else.
I can't help you. Try asking around.
Go on. Go through, sir.
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Madam, do you have a token?.
Go through.
Long live Lord Ganesh
Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva
O dear lord, master of all.
You have answered my prayers.
All I need now is Miss TSM.
My forehead has become dented from
bowing at Shiva's temple.
I'll cook the finest delicacies for you.
Your father, Lord Shiva,
never heeded me.
Please, Lord Ganesh.
My God!
I didn't order a dish but here it is.
A woman as lovely as cake
can only be a gift from Lord Ganesh.
You are no ordinary dish!
Lord Ganesh seasoned you himself.
My number's been called. I'll be back.
Rascal.
What's happening to me?.
A fellow is dancing like a loony,
I'll just check, sir.
The token will be mine.
Thanks to Dance Master G9.
Give me back my token! Wicked girl.
You bad girl!
A bomb!
Miss TSM!
Sidhu!
I'll give you a tight slap.
Off to China! If you please.
Okay. I won't go.
I'm furious. Take your bags inside!
No one can stop a hurricane.
Not by cursing or kicking.
Let him go to China.
You crook! My shoe will land on
your head and knock sense into you.
Move it. You always trust the wrong people.
You will never change.
Let me go to China
and fulfill my dream.
Stop dreaming! You'll wake up
and find you have nothing.
What do I have now?.
No car, no house, no servant.
Not even a mother on my side.
I started life in a dustbin.
I might end up on a rubbish heap.
Well done, brother. Well spoken.
You were so high when I took you in.
I became your family.
I raised you.
And you talk of ending up
on a rubbish heap.
You trust that crook.
You think a potato is a god.
You don't have a grain of self-belief.
I yell at you. I hit you.
I'm nobody to you, right?.
So you talk of ending up on a rubbish heap.
Very well. Be on your way.
I don't want anything from you.
Dada. For my sake, wait.
I know...
...you taught me everything.
You brought me up.
My destiny won't be made here.
It will be made in China.
I know you will save me if I get into trouble.
Dada, don't be angry with me. Let me go.
Dada, if everything goes well,
promise you'll come to China.
Me?. To China?. No.
Of course. If you don't come,
who will kick me in the backside?.
How will I fly through the air?.
Tell me the truth.
You won't let me go
because you'll miss me, right?. Don't lie.
Be careful, brother.
Danger lurks in the strangest places.
And so with Dada's blessings,
Sidhu set off to China.
Let me close the bin.
Our things will fall out.
Are you stupid?.
The little touches that count.
Jet Airways.
Master! She's a wicked girl.
Don't trust her! She's bad.
Lower your voice.
No woman can be trusted.
From Chandni Chowk to China
I haven 't figured out who I am
Look at my face
Plain and simple
Everyone tells me I'm a king
Not a pauper
Who threw a banana peel here?.
Chinese comrades! Ready?.
Have you seen your face in the mirror?
You look a right clown
Zero brains
Push you and you'll topple over
Silly oaf
It's a sham, all a scam
She walks away, stirring his heart
See how he abandons his dreams
And goes after her
Have you seen your face in the mirror?
Girl! Get my drift?
Stop showing me attitude
I'm as hot as they get
Stop teasing me
I claw like a cat
Uniforms fear me
My braid is a blade
You big hulk, get lost
Like tamarind, I'm tangy and sweet
Like lightning, I'll burn you to eternity
Silly oaf
It's a sham, all a scam
Her mischief has made mincemeat of you
Where did she come from?
Who does she think she is?
Grabbing everything in sight
This doll or that doll will do
As long as she's made in China
Let them burn with envy
Here I go
Chandni Chowk behind me
China up ahead
Chinatown
Let's go down
Chinatown
Silly oaf
It's no sham, it's no scam
Have no fear
The lord above
Will make this clown a king
From Chandni Chowk to China
I haven't figured out who I am.
-Are you--?.
-Stupid. Stupid, stupid.
Go to sleep.
Are you both stupid?.
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!
Lord Ganesh! I am in China.
See that, Chopstick?.
Now he has the disciples,
and you're left holding the bags.
Flies love caviar as much as garbage.
Look at him! He isn't even a flea.
That's her!
Get out of the way. Move.
Stop her. She's a cheat.
Where are you heading?.
Are you nice as sugar and spice?.
Or bitter as lemon?.
How did you turn Chinese?. Or is it
"do in Rome as the Romans do?."
Indian arts are now martial arts, eh?.
What's this?. How did this bun appear?.
-Who baked it?.
-Stop it.
You said "tit."
Sidhu, have you gone nuts?.
Why are you harassing the lady?.
That's no lady. Miss TSM is a cheat.
I won't spare her.
Wait for me!
Who baked your bun?.
Get your paws off the women!
Diamonds seized.
Liu Sheng?. An Indian.
Go to India
and find out who this man is.
Hojo sends his henchman, Joey,
to uncover the truth about Sidhu.
Meow Meow wondered
why Sidhu chased her at the airport.
And why he thought he knew her.
I'm Miss TSM. I'm Sakhi.
How will I explain in Chinese?.
Miss Sakhi, welcome to the TSM factory
in China.
I'm a Chinese guy
Hello to you
Multi Language Translator
Now watch the magic
How come they speak Hindi?.
I speak every lingo of the world
Press the button
You can speak too
Like a necklace
Wear it close to your heart
Wow, you're a genius.
A magic umbrella
It comes in handy, rain or shine
A shield against bullets.
Wow, James Bond.
You'll say it's a parachute too?.
Lands like a feather
This pepper spray stings
A girl's perfect bodyguard
Now, isn 't that smart?
I'm Miss TSM from China.
Thank you.
Put the products in her car.
This way, please.
You're such a big star in India.
All this way for the samples?.
From India to China.
So far?.
Far?. China is very close to my heart.
My parents met here.
My dad. Inspector Chiang Kohung.
You're under arrest, Hojo!
My twin, Suzy...
...and I were born in China.
Suzy. Suzy. Sakhi.
Suzy?.
Suzy. Sakhi.
My family met their ruin in China.
Smile.
Okay, thank you.
-Go. I'll join you. Take Sakhi.
-And you?.
Suzy. Suzy.
Run!
My husband!
My daughter! Suzy!
Chiang Kohung!
No! Suzy!
We never found Suzy's or Dad's body.
Mother couldn't bear her loss
and she too....
She always said they were still alive.
I came all the way to China
to lay them to rest...
...and find peace.
Dad, Suzy...
...I could never meet you.
Suzy?.
I, Sakhi Kohung Chiang, promise...
...I'll never forget you.
Sakhi?.
Suzy?
No!
Subtitle?.
They say Liu Sheng died here.
No, he didn't die. He was martyred.
Take it easy.
Pay your respects.
-Liu Sheng!
-Liu Sheng!
We're after Meow Meow.
Hello!
Have I so many fans in China?.
-There she is!
-Stop!
The police?. Fans of mine?. Autograph?.
-No autograph?.
-You're under arrest!
Arrest?.
No!
Catch me!
Where is Lord Ganesh?.
Where is he?.
I fell. I didn't even realize it.
No! She's a dangerous woman.
She's violent.
Liu Sheng doesn't hurt women.
The Indian hero.
Meow Meow.
Not here. Over there.
What did I blurt out?.
Liu Sheng!
Master! I am in your country!
A poor boy from Chandni Chowk.
I'm here!
All the way from Chandni Chowk!
Your king has come!
Hello to each and everyone.
He's here. Liu Sheng has arrived. Hurry.
Costume. Makeup. Disguise.
No one will recognize me.
Meow Meow returned defeated.
Liu Sheng?. As if!
Meow Meow was sure Hojo
would end her days...
...but he had another thought in mind:
To kill Sidhu.
How sweet is the taste of money
Survival is tough
But never forget what I tell you
You can never escape your destiny
I raise a toast to you, my friend
The world is at your feet
Now stand up
And claim what is rightfully yours
Be the master of your destiny
Master, this is an Indian song.
O broad-shouldered, big-hearted
Iron-chested one
There 's nothing to fear, now you 're here
From Chandni Chowk to China
A friend of yours has come from India
Say hello
Make merry at night
Take it easy all day
Everyone dance and sing
It's a holiday, time for fun
Attack!
There is no rich or poor, no high or low
Everyone dance together, friend or foe
No black-marketeering
Clean dealings today
Make merry at night
Take it easy all day
Say hello to your friend
A friend of yours has come from India
Say hello!
Make merry at night
And now to sleep in China
God. Why do I itch all over?.
I got it all wrong.
Try and understand. I'm innocent.
I don't know why the police want me.
Master. Tomorrow's papers will have
a photo of me.
-I hit her and your photo is printed?.
-No. Your photo too.
-Go. Go to sleep.
-Master, I want to sleep next to you.
Shut it tight, master.
-Get to bed. You'll be fine.
-Listen to me, master.
I'll check it again.
Get to bed, Sidhu.
She's changed again.
My lips are sealed, alas
It's a secret, come near
How did you get here?.
Touch me, touch me, touch me
I said, I said, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I said, I said, hold me, hold me, hold me
Save me, master.
She stole my heart
And walked away
That's my signature tune.
I lost my mind, I'm half-crazed
What's this thing called love?
I'm terrified, master.
I must sleep next to you.
-What's wrong, master?.
-Nothing. I'm closing the door.
Make sure it's locked.
She's a slippery customer.
Suzy!
Suzy! Suzy!
Suzy!
Suzy!
Suzy!
Suzy!
What a girl.
No need to put on the light.
You dazzle like lightning.
So beautiful.
Like these ignorant folk...
...you also believe Sidhu is Liu Sheng.
You mistake the monkey for the master.
He's a loser. A vegetable cutter
from Chandni Chowk.
He dances to my tune.
He's no Liu Sheng.
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng.
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng?.
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng?.
That's what I said. He's a loser.
He's nothing.
He's a fool. I am everything.
I am everything.
This time Meow Meow
has the perfect gift for Hojo:
A way to kill Sidhu.
Chopstick.
Suzy.
Suzy?. Wanted?.
Sidhu?.
Wait.
Don't tell her anything.
Tell them what you told me...
...about Liu Sheng.
Sidhu is nothing.
He is a loser. A fraud.
A vegetable cutter.
A vegetable cutter.
Daddy, I tricked him.
He doesn't know.
He was brought here to kill Hojo.
Greetings from India. I have proof, Hojo.
Hojo?.
Master.
She's always giving me the slip.
Where's the girl?.
Liu Sheng, how are you?.
Liu Sheng, how are you?.
Liu Sheng?.
Sidhu?. Sidhu?.
Liu Sheng?.
-We caught Meow Meow.
-No! I'm not her.
-Meow Meow!
-Liu Sheng?.
Hojo!
Hojo is here!
Hojo is here!
Run for your life!
Run for your life!
-Liu Sheng!
-Liu Sheng!
These kids are real naughty.
-Come. Kill Hojo!
-You want to take a photo?.
What's the hurry?.
Where were you all night?.
See how they respect me?.
It's all thanks to you.
They want to take our picture.
You come too.
The photographer?.
Hojo!
Hey. Not the statue. Take a picture of me.
Come on. Take the picture.
Indians and Chinese.
Brothers all the way.
Where's your camera?. Where is it?.
-Liu Sheng.
-That's right. I'm Liu Sheng.
Liu Sheng! Liu Sheng! Liu Sheng!
Hojo! Hojo! Hojo!
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!
Hojo! Hojo! Who will take my photo?.
Tell your friend about me.
And tell him what I'm going to do to him.
Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo!
Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo!
Dado Hojo! Dado--
Sidhu, I lied to you.
Run from here, Sidhu.
Let go of me!
Sidhu!
Dada?.
I made a terrible mistake.
I was no Liu Sheng in a previous life.
I was a mosquito. And still am.
Sir, I'm an ordinary man
from Chandni Chowk.
Dada's foolish boy.
Don't beg!
No, it isn't his fault. I'm to blame.
Punish me.
Let him go, sir. It isn't his fault.
It isn't his fault.
Sidhu, get up!
I'll be disgraced forever.
Sidhu, get up!
This is the man you call your Liu Sheng?.
Liu Sheng?.
You think you can destroy me?.
You want this man to save your village?.
First let's see...
...if he can save one man.
If you can't use your hands to defend me,
then don't fold them to beg.
Destroy them! Remember you are
from Chandni Chowk.
You bastard!
You have 20 hired hands and think
you're a strong man.
If you're so brave, then fight me.
I'll chop you into bits and scatter them.
You are naive.
Don't trust these work-shy bastards.
Danger lurks in the strangest places.
I know you'll save me
if I get into trouble.
Liu Sheng?.
Throw this Chandni Chowk man
out of China!
You want to be Liu Sheng?.
Then die like him.
Sidhu!
The man whose hand I clasped
As I walked
He changed life's colors for me
My life turned upside down in a minute
Filled with grief
My God is slumbering
My protector has gone away from me
Having shown me the path to tread
Your destiny is not
in the lines of your palm...
...but in hard work.
His name is Sidhu
Dada.
Now what do you want?.
My sister.
I belong nowhere.
I have no one to turn to.
I can't go back to Chandni Chowk.
Give me some work. I'll do anything.
I'll shine your shoes.
To unite Meow Meow and Sakhi,
Chopstick joined Hojo 's gang.
Three months later.
You blessed me with one hand...
...and took Dada away with the other.
Why, Lord Ganesh?. Why?.
What can I do here in China?.
Where to go?.
Oh, Lord. No one speaks Hindi here.
What shall I do?. Show me the way, Lord.
Have you lost your mind?.
Talking to a potato.
Make french fries and eat them.
You've lost weight.
It isn't a potato.
This is my god.
Don't talk nonsense, old beggar.
And people say I'm mad.
What did you say?.
I said, people say I'm mad.
You speak Hindi.
I was just repeating what I hear.
But you're speaking Hindi.
No, it's Chinese.
No. You were speaking Hindi.
How can I?. I'm Chinese. You're mad.
Sure. You're Chinese.
But you can speak Hindi.
Be quiet. I can't remember.
I know nothing.
Lord, I asked for the way
and you send the whole map.
Stay away from me.
Lord Ganesh has sent you.
Lord Ganesh has sent you.
People here think I'm Liu Sheng. Listen.
Old beggar, listen to me.
My God has sent you.
Do you understand who Lord Ganesh is?.
Old beggar, listen to me.
Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng.
Hojo?.
Your future and your past have changed,
Sidhu.
You're the great warrior Liu Sheng.
Dada, I will avenge your death.
I will become Liu Sheng.
I will become Liu Sheng.
That's good. Look at my friend.
Go on. Laugh.
When I become Liu Sheng,
I'll be laughing at you.
Go on. Laugh.
The great beggar of China's Great Wall.
I'm not a beggar. I'm Liu Sheng.
Sure. They'll laugh themselves silly.
But don't stop your brick-smashing act.
When I have some chicken soup
and my muscles are toned...
...I'll become Liu Sheng.
What do you want?.
My friend needs food.
We have nothing cooked.
Can't you see?. We're redecorating.
Get out.
What did he say?.
He said the restaurant is closed now.
No food here.
What do you mean?. I can cook.
Well! So Liu Sheng is a chef?.
Yes, he is.
You're no better than me.
You've no family and remember nothing.
Look at your face. You look like a beggar.
White Bull!
What are you doing?. Get out!
Police! Police!
Police!
Sorry.
Liu Sheng has stirred.
Liu Sheng has stirred in me.
Liu Sheng has stirred.
Greetings.
Liu Sheng has stirred.
You fool. It's me. The old beggar.
-Is Liu Sheng alive?. Then fight him.
-He's dead now.
My eyes!
Easy. My legs aren't made of steel. Fool!
What are you doing?.
Liu Sheng has saved me.
Not Liu Sheng. I saved you.
Why didn't you save me again?.
Save you?. I'll show you saving.
He's back.
Give me your hand.
Chiang Kohung.
Old beggar. Are you Chiang Kohung?.
Chiang Kohung. You're still alive.
You killed Dada. My Dada.
You killed Dada. My Dada.
Dead at last.
Lord Ganesh has sent you to me.
Make me your disciple, o learned one.
-You're under arrest.
-I want to be under you.
Get off.
The murder weapon. The corpse.
The evidence.
You're the killer. Straight to prison.
Case solved.
-What case?.
-This case.
You stay right here.
I'm calling the police.
Don't move.
Odd fellow.
He imagines he's a police officer.
Opera?.
Hello.
I'm waiting behind the Opera.
I'm on my way.
Any word from Joey?.
Go. Call him.
The boss wants his specs.
Sidhu.
Give me my hat.
Hurry up, idiot.
Run, Sidhu, run.
-What's going on?.
-Sidhu is alive.
Hojo has gone after him.
Stop right here.
-Sidhu.
-Sidhu.
Get in the car.
You handle them. I'll follow Sidhu.
Go, go.
I'm trying to enjoy...
...playing this game with you...
...my friend.
But the game is over. The winner is....
Meow Meow?.
Come with me. Come on.
Let go of me.
Where are you dragging me,
Meow Meow?.
I'm Miss TSM. Your Sakhi.
Miss TSM?.
The Chinese Consulate girl?.
He's here. Come on!
-Only one way to escape.
-That's suicide.
Your eyes smiled at me
Overwhelming my heart
Now I have found you, don 't go away
Stay in my eyes
Sleep in my embrace
These are the ways of love
Some magical encounters
We meet, our hearts smile
The season changes
Your smiling eyes
This is me and my twin, Suzy.
No wonder! I was so confused.
A dark cloud hung over me
every time I saw your sister.
But when I....
When I see you....
Look at me.
When I see you, my heart floats.
I feel like gliding away like a butterfly.
Off to prison.
Why are you hitting me?.
No prison for me. I have lots to do.
You should be thanking me.
Your memory is back.
Stop hitting me. You're not an inspector.
You're Chiang Kohung.
Chiang?.
Nothing but punches
since I arrived in China.
Who's Chiang Kohung?.
Chiang Kohung! Enough is enough. Stop!
Where do you think you're going?.
Why are you hitting me?.
Sakhi. Sakhi. Sakhi.
Sakhi.
Hey. Hey.
Dad?.
Whose dad?.
My daughter.
Whose daughter?.
Dad.
Believe me. I've told you everything.
I know nothing else.
I'm a poor teahouse owner.
They came and wrecked my place.
The enemy is back.
Sir, Hojo knows you're alive.
He knows Sidhu--
Let him go.
Sidhu...
...forgive me.
Please?.
I want to learn kung fu and karate.
Be a master like you...
...and avenge Dada's murder.
You want to learn kung fu?.
Take revenge, eh?. Against Hojo?.
Hojo has erased 20 years of my life.
Leave the avenging to me.
-You relax.
-Should I go back to India?.
Yes.
Then I'll go back.
When people ask, "Where's Dada?."
what do I say?.
"Well, Dada's dead."
"How come?."
"Because of me."
"What did you do?."
"I sat by and watched."
You relax, sir.
You have found your family...
...but I will never find my Dada again.
He has gone forever.
He died a dog's death
at the hands of Hojo.
He came from Chandni Chowk
to show me he cared.
And Hojo slit his throat.
I will have my revenge on Hojo.
Hojo will kill him too.
It's my fault, pinning my hopes on you.
Dada always said,
"Don't count on anyone.
Believe in yourself, Sidhu."
And that's what I'll do from now.
You watch. The world will watch.
I'll kill Hojo.
I'll do it alone.
Dada.
Why are you here?.
Your training starts tomorrow.
What's this?.
What's wrong?.
FIying to the moon?. You clown.
Don't teach me any old rubbish.
I want to learn kung fu.
Be the best, not second best. Get it?.
I want to learn kung fu, not tickling.
Cosmos Thumb. My special move.
Untouched outside. Pieces within.
I want to learn Cosmos Kung Fu.
There's an old Shaolin saying:
"Fear not
the 1 0,000 moves practiced once.
Fear the single move
practiced 1 0,000 times."
Look within you, Sidhu.
Have you such a move?.
A move you've known since childhood...
...that no one can match.
Everyone has such a move.
A move that's second nature to you.
Your own kung fu will help you
the day you challenge Hojo.
Tell me.
I eat and drink every day.
I chop vegetables.
I bathe, I wash. That's it.
Training you
will probably drive me crazy again.
Masterji.
No arrows, no swords
No weapons, no bullets
You are your own army
You are your own force
Is this kung fu?.
If it is, then every Indian woman
who rolls bread is better than Bruce Lee.
I rolled bread in India. Now here too.
Tell me, daughter.
What was life like when you were 4?.
Four?. How can I remember, Dad?.
Take your time.
We have nothing but time on our hands.
Let me fill you in.
She drank milk when she was 4.
I'm over 27, and still making bread.
Wow, delicious.
-Can I have another bread?.
-Another?. I'm breaking my back here.
Enough is enough.
Wait, I'll do it. Okay, enjoy the bread.
Now for the next move.
The next move?.
If you weren't Sakhi's father,
I'd shove this you know where.
I've chopped vegetables all my life.
Now you teach me to roll bread.
I want to learn kung fu.
Will you teach me or not?.
Here's some kung fu for you.
Why are you hitting me?.
This is called Iron Forearm Kung Fu.
I smashed it. Like the star Dara Singh.
I'm a kung fu master.
Put everything behind you
And forge ahead
The enemy will run for cover
If you use your might
Higher.
I've mastered Iron Forearm.
Soon I'll master Iron Legs, Iron Chest...
...Iron Stomach and Iron--
Enough.
Don't stop me.
My body has turned to iron.
My iron man.
Let's go for an iron kiss.
A ticket for India?.
Rusty iron is of little use to anyone.
Hojo isn't my enemy. You are.
I know. Stay away from her.
Enough?. Can I get down?.
Higher.
Okay?.
Do you want me to call on God?.
Dad, he'll fall.
-No more training then.
-Never mind, Sakhi. Your father is a tyrant.
-I see a bird's nest. Okay?.
-Jump.
What?. Did you say "thump?."
-I said, jump.
-Impossible. Stop joking.
Joking?.
Wow!
You're a clown. Hojo will die of laughter
when he watches your moves.
Fall from any height
without breaking a limb.
Land like a feather.
Jump.
I'm jumping.
You're hopeless.
Go back to Chandni Chowk.
Just make your way home.
-Sakhi, pack his bags.
-No, I'll jump.
Sakhi. Sakhi. Sakhi.
Forging metal turns it to gold
Turn your body to steel
Be brave and even God will bet on you
Let embers smolder
Let diamonds dazzle
Do it!
Today's the day
It's beyond you.
Your growl echoes like the roar of a lion
You are no less than a tall mountain
Wrestle the fiercest waves
Stop the raging storm
Do it!
Today's the day
In the face of danger, show your might
The might of force
Your goal is nearing you
Show your might
Do it!
Today's the day
If you so desire
You can conquer the world
Just believe in yourself
Dada!
Sidhu was trained and ready.
Hojo got his diamonds back...
...and Chopstick
was still spying for Sakhi.
Frankie.
Ship out the diamonds.
Chopstick has sent news.
See you at the harbor.
Make sure no outsiders here.
-Good morning, sir.
-What?.
Hello.
Not his shoulder. Hit his chest. Like this.
-What move was that?.
-The Wild Bull.
You keep at it.
I'll sit and watch.
No good. Six out of 1 0.
I'm busting a gut here...
...and you're unimpressed.
From Chandni Chowk to China
Look at my face
Plain and simple
They say I'm a king, not a pauper
Don't use your hand to stop traffic.
Stop the enemy's heart.
-Get it?. You lazy fool!
-Lazy fool?.
-Sidhu!
-What?.
Don't move, or he dies.
The same old dialogue.
"Don't move, or he dies,"
et cetera, et cetera.
Sidhu, my day of reckoning has come.
Master, you have great powers,
and are all-knowing.
-Your predictions come true.
-Stop.
Kill him. Don't worry about me.
You worry me the least.
Stop, or he dies.
You stopped.
I knew you cared for me deep down.
No way. A question for you.
Must I immerse your ashes in the Ganges...
...or in a Chinese river?. Well?.
Let's split your remains.
Ashes here, urn there.
Finish him off.
Sidhu, forgive me. I touch your feet.
Cosmic Thumb.
Touch my feet, then.
In the face of danger, show your might
Your goal is nearing you
Show your might
Let your breath be your guide
Let your feelings show
Do it!
Today's the day
If you so desire
You can conquer the world
Just believe in yourself
That's new.
Cosmic Kick.
Thank you.
Nine and a half.
Thank you, thank you.
Only nine and a half?. You old man!
Hojo heard a familiar voice on the phone.
A voice he had not heard for 20 years.
Hojo was promised the return of his son
in exchange of--
Meow Meow.
Time you know the truth
about your father.
Hojo' s men are everywhere.
Suzy. I want you to know I'm your--
This is for my father.
You killed my father.
You destroyed my family.
Sidhu!
Attack!
Why did Suzy stab you?.
No, it's all Hojo's ruthless scheming.
Suzy believes I murdered her father.
Sidhu, where to?.
To where it all began.
-He's my father, isn't he?.
-He's a foe.
It was now clear to Meow Meow.
Hojo had kept the truth from her.
We made a big mistake.
You're not a reincarnation of Liu Sheng.
You don't owe us anything.
You had better go.
Tell him to leave.
We know he isn't Liu Sheng.
Sidhu, they say they made a big mistake.
You aren't Liu Sheng.
The village is their problem, not yours.
They say, "Return to Chandni Chowk."
I may not be Liu Sheng...
...but now they are my own people.
So what if I was a mosquito
or Liu Sheng in a previous birth?.
My purpose in this lifetime...
...is to destroy Hojo.
Lord Ganesh.
Today I'll fight alone.
Just me.
Lord, you've always been on my side,
and always will be.
-Where are you going?.
-Hojo is here. I'm all right.
I have both your daughters now.
Stop right there.
Who will stop me?.
I will.
You traitor!
One of my daughters goes after me.
Papa.
Suzy...
...Sidhu will fight alone.
Liu Sheng. Ready for your next rebirth?.
Sidhu.
Dada?.
The time of promises is over
Seize the day
Learn the wisdom of action
Take what belongs to you
Never beg for what is rightfully yours
So you still believe God is in the potato?.
God only helps those
who help themselves.
Believe in yourself, Sidhu.
Your destiny isn't in your palm lines.
It's in your might.
Know your true self.
Chop them down like corn and carrots.
Destroy them!
Get up, Sidhu.
Please.
Sidhu.
Sidhu.
Fear not 1 0,000 moves practiced once.
Fear a single move
practiced 1 0,000 times.
Look within yourself, Sidhu.
Your destiny is not in your palm lines.
It's in your might.
Do you have a unique move
that none can match?.
Know your true self.
That move is within you, Sidhu.
Chop them like corn and carrots.
That move is within you, Sidhu.
Destroy them!
Sidhu, look within.
Do you know such a move?.
Do you have such a move, Sidhu?.
A potato?.
You're laughing?. You're done for.
The man with hesitant steps
Is now steady
Making the impossible possible
He is a new man
-Liu Sheng.
-Sidhu.
Sidhu! Sidhu! Sidhu!
Now watch my Indian kung fu.
The kung fu that I learned
in Chandni Chowk's lanes.
That kung fu that all Indian women practice
as they chop vegetables.
That kung fu--
His name is Sidhu
Bread. All shapes and sizes,
with cheese or radishes?.
Shall I repeat the menu for you?.
Bread. All shapes and sizes,
with cheese or radishes?.
Will I serve you up as a potato dumpling?.
Sidhu!
Why so quiet?. Cheer me on!
Sidhu! Sidhu! Sidhu!
He sees big dreams
He does great deeds
The Delhi dreamer
Is now China 's champ
The potato of the day...
...is cut to size.
And that's how Sidhu--
Liu Sheng ended Hojo 's days.
How long could the great Liu Sheng
tolerate tyranny?
His spirit can rest in peace now.
Happy days have returned
to Zhange village.
With Dada 's blessings...
...Sidhu champions a charming cheer
from Chandni Chowk to China.
Inspector Chiang was at last reunited
with his daughters.
Chopstick was delighted to discover
his Chinese roots.
But Sidhu warned him:
No more conning!
What's this?
What's wrong?.
Sidhu.
Sidhu?.
They say they have a big problem
in their village.
I'm no troubleshooter.
How come you understand them?.
-Sidhu, I lied to you.
-About what?.
-My mother wasn't from China.
-Africa?.
From Chandni Chowk to Africa
