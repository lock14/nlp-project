{2599}{2640}This country
{2643}{2730}is at war with Germany.
{3419}{3443}Many are bombed
{3446}{3491}out of their homes...
{3494}{3583}Today of the evacuation|of London's schoolchildren.
{3586}{3663}Aircraft were launched|in two attacks against London
{3666}{3687}and South East England.
{3690}{3729}A good hundred feet|below ground,
{3732}{3774}but they feel safe.
{4672}{4698}You're not a coward.
{4701}{4751}I don't want to die.
{4754}{4776}And why should I?
{4779}{4817}And if I don't,|why should anyone else?
{4820}{4887}Yet still you wouldn't|make peace now.
{4890}{4941}Not now.
{4944}{4983}You wouldn't support that.|You couldn't.
{4986}{5061}We've only got the one life,|Anita, just the one.
{5064}{5086}Dylan?
{5089}{5150}Is it?
{5153}{5207}Dylan Thomas.
{5210}{5273}It is, isn't it?
{5306}{5347}You might at least|have lifted my veil.
{5350}{5375}My God, still love me?
{5378}{5407}Did I ever?
{5410}{5461}Lift the veil, Vera,|lift the bloody veil.
{5525}{5588}Look at you.
{5591}{5620}Look at you.
{5623}{5645}Not been called up?
{5648}{5695}Just because I haven't got|a uniform.
{5698}{5743}It's me that puts the heart|in the nation.
{5746}{5795}Ammo factories, I sing in.
{5798}{5857}- Down the tubes right now.|- I always loved your voice.
{5860}{5883}Always.
{5886}{5921}Amongst other things|I loved about you.
{5924}{5959}Don't you come it,|Dylan Thomas!
{5962}{6000}- You haven't changed.|- 'Course I have, thank God.
{6003}{6059}You can't.|And don't, not ever.
{6062}{6120}If you do,|I won't let you.
{6123}{6202}I heard you on the radio.
{6205}{6256}Like going home, it was,|your poems.
{6259}{6288}Like going back.
{6291}{6356}Where's the posh accent from?
{6359}{6387}You should've looked me up.
{6390}{6478}Should I?
{6481}{6543}If I can get all my friends|to donate five bob each...
{6546}{6581}this is the plan, see.
{6584}{6611}If I get them all to do that,
{6614}{6640}then I don't have|to sell my soul
{6643}{6683}writing bloody propaganda films.
{6686}{6717}I can write my bloody poetry.
{6720}{6773}You'd have|to join the army.
{6776}{6839}Grade Three sitting here|before you, Vera.
{6842}{6903}Lungs raddled|like a Sunday whore.
{6986}{7063}So... lend us five bob.
{7066}{7120}I'll give you a snout,|Dylan Thomas,
{7123}{7148}that's all you'll get from me.
{7151}{7212}Give us, then.
{7215}{7280}Silver's for the lonely,|Vera Bera.
{7289}{7311}Who says I'm lonely?
{7314}{7372}Well, where's the man|who'll give you gold?
{7375}{7398}That an offer, is it?
{7401}{7444}It's always been shares|with you and me.
{7447}{7475}You never had anything to share.
{7478}{7500}Yes, but if I did,
{7503}{7584}if ever I did,|you'd be the first.
{7587}{7631}There's no folks|like home folks.
{7634}{7695}And folks you've|grown up with...
{7738}{7830}they're the best of all.
{7833}{7855}You win.
{7858}{7918}Goody.
{8025}{8087}Forever and always.
{8142}{8168}You won't, will you?
{8171}{8194}Won't what, lovely?
{8197}{8256}You won't get lost again?
{8540}{8600}Ta, mate.
{9080}{9142}Hello, love!
{9343}{9395}I have longed to move away
{9398}{9479}from the hissing|of the spent lie
{9482}{9562}and the old terrors'|continual cry,
{9565}{9596}growing more terrible
{9599}{9716}as the day goes over the hill|into the deep sea.
{9719}{9777}I have longed to move away
{9780}{9849}from the repetition of salutes.
{9852}{9911}For there are ghosts in the air
{9914}{9997}and ghostly echoes on paper.
{10000}{10118}This is Dylan Thomas|for the BBC Home Service.
{10279}{10336}- Hello, darling!|- Where you going?
{10339}{10377}Tension, four hundredweight.
{10380}{10403}The commentary
{10406}{10454}has to persuade women|to join the balloon defenses.
{10457}{10502}"Shaft a Jerry,
{10505}{10551}and maybe one of our|boys in blue will shaft you."
{10554}{10576}That do you?
{10579}{10638}Your talents really|are wasted here, Dylan.
{10641}{10697}We could have a drink|if you like.
{10700}{10739}After.
{10742}{10821}- 'Course we could.|- I'm not a bloody dog, Dylan.
{10824}{10887}It's the brunette,|isn't it?
{10926}{10994}I had a golden childhood,|Anita.
{10997}{11041}And here it is turning up|all unexpected.
{11044}{11120}Now I can't look a golden|childhood in the mouth, can I?
{11123}{11195}The commentary, please, Dylan.
{11305}{11349}Myselves,
{11352}{11402}the grievers grieve|among the street,
{11405}{11477}burned to tireless death.
{11480}{11551}A child of a few hours|with its kneading mouth
{11554}{11649}charred on the black breast|of the grave the mother dug
{11652}{11694}and its arms full of fires.
{11697}{11719}Oh, please,
{11722}{11757}spare us|the bloody tragedy, man.
{11760}{11808}I need something hopeful here.
{11870}{11943}The lion once known|as Jehovah...
{11951}{11996}Rose up and cocked|its leg over.
{11999}{12048}The lioness roared,|Jehovah had scored
{12051}{12089}all over|the living room sofa.
{12092}{12141}Dylan, I require|a commentary.
{12144}{12175}Dylan!
{12178}{12256}Dylan!
{12699}{12720}Caitlin?
{12723}{12773}I thought you told me|you couldn't live without me.
{12776}{12803}Where's our son?
{12806}{12864}Chopped up|in little bits
{12867}{12906}and packed with my knickers|in the suitcase.
{12909}{12950}Oh, dear,|the police'll be chasing you.
{12953}{12992}Don't pretend|you want him here.
{12995}{13026}Well, there's bombs,|isn't there?
{13029}{13068}It's nothing|to do with bombs.
{13071}{13143}You don't want him,|so I didn't bring him.
{13181}{13216}I've never been|a father before, Cat.
{13219}{13240}That's the thing.
{13243}{13304}It's not straightforward.
{13307}{13342}Still the light of your life,|am I?
{13345}{13367}In the New Forest, is he?
{13370}{13420}What are you asking for,|Dullun?
{13423}{13465}You know damn well|our son's with my mother.
{13468}{13519}I love you, Cat.
{13522}{13575}Give us a fag, then.
{13578}{13611}I'm out of bleeding fags.
{13614}{13724}Give my head a good scratch,|please?
{13727}{13783}Lovely.
{13786}{13829}- Where are we living?|- Nowhere.
{13832}{13865}Velvet your|bloody claws!
{13868}{13905}Scratch your own|bloody head!
{13908}{13929}- Come here.|- No.
{13932}{13954}- Yes.|- No.
{13957}{14008}Kiss me.
{14279}{14343}Excuse me,|you dropped your handkerchief.
{14346}{14407}No, I didn't.
{14410}{14466}Yes, you did, right there.
{14498}{14519}It's not mine, sorry.
{14522}{14580}You're supposed|to take the hankie,
{14583}{14614}I'm supposed|to introduce myself,
{14617}{14647}buy you a drink.
{14650}{14696}I don't want a drink.
{14745}{14790}Nice try, though.
{14793}{14828}I've actually|never done this before.
{14831}{14946}No, you've just never|been caught out before.
{15047}{15114}Hello, darling.
{15142}{15210}Sod you, then.
{15248}{15271}Oh, dear, picky,|picky, picky.
{15274}{15316}You're late.
{15319}{15365}I know.|It's all her fault.
{15469}{15513}Who's your friend?
{15516}{15538}Queen of Ireland,
{15541}{15614}love of my life,|mother of my child,
{15617}{15674}Caitlin Thomas.
{15682}{15749}Your wife, Dylan?
{15770}{15844}The one and only.
{15857}{15890}He didn't mention.
{15893}{15932}Well, he wouldn't...
{15935}{16007}would he?
{16088}{16202}You made that,|didn't you?
{16205}{16226}I might like you.
{16229}{16342}Then again, I might not.
{16345}{16422}I'll await your decision,|shall I?
{16425}{16518}I won't hold my breath, mind.
{16521}{16565}Got a mansion|we could share with you?
{16568}{16609}Yes, two little homeless orphans|you're looking at here.
{16612}{16652}I've only got a room.
{16655}{16714}Bugger.|Condemned to her sister's, then.
{16745}{16782}I'll be having that,|sailor boy.
{16785}{16878}- Needn't let...|- Small matter of a wife?
{16924}{16991}Nothing should ever|come between us.
{17004}{17029}Oh, God, Dylan.
{17032}{17090}Soul mates, we are, Vera,|always were.
{17093}{17125}Don't.
{17128}{17227}Stop talking about me.
{17246}{17354}There's a phone in the hall|where I stay, you know.
{17366}{17443}If you want me,|he's got my number.
{17548}{17620}What does it mean|when she smiles?
{17643}{17731}I don't know, never did.
{17837}{17859}God help us.
{17862}{17935}It's the Visigoths from Wales.
{17938}{17983}Your sister's here.
{17986}{18034}Back from strangling Germans,
{18037}{18083}then, are you?
{18086}{18111}Left all the other little boys
{18114}{18147}playing with|their little pistols,
{18150}{18232}all ging-gang-gooley|and yo-ho-ho.
{18235}{18296}That what you call|poetry, is it?
{18299}{18397}Look, give us a bed and we'll stay|out from under your feet.
{20347}{20427}Sometimes I can nurse|a single pint all night.
{20430}{20483}But that's sometimes.
{20486}{20534}Thank you.
{20537}{20568}Oh, yeah!
{20571}{20635}I thought it was hilarious.
{20638}{20676}I'll get them in.
{20679}{20702}You pay, though, Vera?
{20705}{20727}Fair dos.
{20730}{20778}Support the starving poet.
{20781}{20808}You are not a bloody poet,|Dylan.
{20811}{20863}You write films|about barrage sodding balloons
{20866}{20891}for your living.
{20894}{20929}There is a war on.
{20932}{20984}You know,|you're not the man I married.
{21005}{21032}I did cartwheels|in a rubber corset
{21035}{21093}in Peter Robinson's window|one time I was hungry.
{21096}{21118}You were never hungry.
{21121}{21165}You've always had a man|to feed you.
{21168}{21207}Demonstration purposes it was.
{21210}{21232}Bet you can't beat that.
{21235}{21307}Bet I can't.
{21370}{21436}He's following me.
{21474}{21517}Don't you have|all the luck.
{21520}{21571}Watch this.
{21842}{21875}Causing chaos, my lovely?
{21878}{21923}What do you need knickers for?|You've only got to wash them.
{21926}{21956}Looking for a good time
{21959}{22022}with a couple of showgirls,|are you?
{22081}{22103}Three more, please.
{22106}{22131}Your drinks are here, chaps.
{22134}{22202}Chief stag's beaten off|the main competition.
{22223}{22278}William Killick.
{22357}{22432}Vera Phillips.|She's very pleased to meet you.
{22435}{22459}Rums all round?
{22462}{22487}Goody.
{22490}{22550}Four rums, please.
{22622}{22662}Do you do cartwheels?
{22665}{22691}On the seashore I might.
{22694}{22767}I'll take you there.
{22770}{22829}You're busy,|by the looks of you.
{22832}{22881}I could do|with a bit of sea air.
{22888}{22943}I'd like to sit|on the beach with you.
{22962}{22991}Don't you know a brush-off|when you get one?
{22994}{23043}Got any smokes?
{23046}{23107}I enjoyed your show.
{23110}{23203}- Did you?|- Yes.
{23206}{23260}- Hey?|- Hay's for horses.
{23263}{23327}Come for a gallop.
{23366}{23418}Used to call it busking,|singing in the tube stations.
{23421}{23493}Coppers used to move you on.
{23496}{23585}I'll come again,|if I may.
{23595}{23646}Free world.
{24113}{24195}Keeping those rums to yourself?
{24198}{24235}We're in danger|of breaking a thirst.
{24238}{24263}I don't melt
{24266}{24307}at the sight of a uniform,|that's all.
{24310}{24371}Sod it.|I don't like nosy parkers.
{24374}{24418}It was a civil question.
{24421}{24461}I could have said,|"Are you after my husband?"
{24464}{24557}But I didn't.
{24560}{24627}Heartache, that's what I see|in a uniform.
{24643}{24704}I'm not gonna love someone|just to have them die off on me.
{24707}{24736}Who's talking about love?
{24739}{24783}Don't you ever get lonely?
{24795}{24830}My work's all I need.
{24833}{24864}I used to think|I'd be a dancer.
{24867}{24939}Danced night and day.
{24984}{25035}I know, you're one of those.
{25047}{25074}No.
{25077}{25128}No! God!
{25131}{25164}Not one of those,|for God's sake!
{25167}{25191}Not that I'm averse.
{25194}{25286}One of the ones that never|got over her first love.
{25289}{25386}'Course I am.
{25472}{25514}Didn't your mother|teach you any manners?
{25517}{25540}All I said...
{25543}{25586}You can walk on your own,|I know.
{25589}{25629}Keep your hand|on your ha'penny,
{25632}{25666}that's what|my mother taught me.
{25669}{25710}I'm not touching you.
{25713}{25765}Well, don't look at me either.
{25768}{25812}Fine.
{25815}{25902}No, don't do that!
{25905}{25996}What have you got against me,|Vera Phillips?
{25999}{26045}You might be dead tomorrow.
{26048}{26169}Live while you can,|live all you can.
{26172}{26210}I won't see you again.
{26213}{26338}Of course not.
{26341}{26416}I'd like my torch back.
{26515}{26591}Please.
{26819}{26876}Don't let the light out!
{26879}{26976}Light of your life.
{26979}{27076}Has to wipe its feet|before it comes back in again.
{27159}{27235}No!
{27238}{27334}Cat. Cat.
{27381}{27448}Little dog needs the toilet.
{27451}{27525}Go bark somewhere else.
{27775}{27887}Come on, Catty.
{27890}{27949}Have you got a poem for me?
{27952}{28013}You still owe me|for the last one.
{28067}{28204}I am not a sodding|deposit box, Dylan.
{28378}{28454}What do you think this is?
{28508}{28567}- Well, it could be a scribble.|- Could be.
{28570}{28624}It could be|a bloody limerick, Dullun.
{28627}{28674}Could be.
{28711}{28836}Among Those Killed in the Dawn Raid|Was a Man Aged a Hundred.
{28839}{28866}Happy piece, is it?
{28869}{28945}Do you want to hear it?
{28948}{28992}Do you?
{28995}{29103}Do you want to hear it?
{29106}{29184}Heavy.
{29338}{29416}"When the morning|was waking over the war,
{29419}{29559}he put on his clothes|and stepped out, and he died.
{29566}{29672}The locks yawned loose|as a blast blew them wide.
{29675}{29737}He dropped where he loved|on the burst pavement..."
{29740}{29791}- Lived.|- What?
{29794}{29854}Lived.
{29857}{29910}Oh, no, it's...|it's loved.
{29913}{29949}You can't read|your own bloody writing.
{29952}{29977}Lived. Lived.
{29980}{30002}Loved.
{30005}{30038}He's a hundred|sodding years old!
{30041}{30063}He can't remember love.
{30066}{30087}For Christ's sake,
{30090}{30135}the bloody word's only there|because I bloody wrote it!
{30138}{30175}"Dropped where he loved
{30178}{30231}on the burst pavement."
{30338}{30423}It's mine, isn't it?
{30426}{30500}What you write.
{30503}{30563}All my words
{30566}{30619}and every heartbeat,
{30622}{30685}they're all for you.
{30688}{30780}Really?
{30783}{30870}Come here, then.
{30873}{30939}Come on, you.
{31049}{31079}Get out of bed
{31082}{31184}and come and see|what he's done this time!
{31271}{31358}Oh, dear, naughty doggy Dylan.
{31361}{31411}Do you know what that is?
{31414}{31514}That's animal behavior,|that's what it is.
{31517}{31569}Nicolette, I'm...
{31572}{31635}I'm...
{31719}{31741}Hello,
{31744}{31767}is Vera Phillips there, please?
{31770}{31856}- Just a moment.|- Thank you.
{31925}{31949}Hello?
{31952}{31973}Hello, darling.
{31976}{32001}Dylan?
{32004}{32049}'Course it is.
{32078}{32145}There was a young hero|called Killick
{32148}{32181}who marched|to the top of a...
{32184}{32245}hillick.
{32249}{32306}He stood legs astride|and whipped out his pride
{32309}{32369}and spread Brylcreem|all over his fillick.
{32372}{32421}What's a fillick?
{32424}{32453}Oh, dear,
{32456}{32484}showing your ignorance now, Cat.
{32487}{32512}William will have a nice one,|whatever it is.
{32515}{32543}Not that you're
{32546}{32571}seeing him again.
{32574}{32598}He'll still have a nice one.
{32601}{32690}Come here, Vera Bera.
{32732}{32789}Come on,|come and have a cuddle.
{32821}{32861}Go on, you're welcome to it.
{32864}{32928}I don't want him.
{33098}{33194}Don't change, Vera Bera.
{33197}{33274}You're the star|in my dark sky.
{33277}{33302}Don't you ever change.
{33305}{33371}What am I in your sky?
{33374}{33412}You're on my earth, Caitlin,
{33415}{33437}just where I want you to be.
{33440}{33462}Come on.
{33465}{33541}Come and have a cuddle.
{33764}{33786}What are you laughing at?
{33789}{33823}What?
{33826}{33859}What?
{33862}{33886}What is it?
{33889}{33957}What?
{33960}{34011}What?
{34108}{34189}Oh, no, no.
{34261}{34342}It's like living with children.
{34439}{34525}- Oh, God!|- I'm going to the pub.
{34665}{34714}What's it like having a son?
{34717}{34808}Oh, exhausting.
{34811}{34887}I can't imagine it.
{34890}{34953}He's a whole world|away from here...
{34990}{35082}safe and sound.
{35208}{35246}You could die in an air raid.
{35249}{35276}I'm not going to.
{35279}{35307}You might.
{35310}{35370}This is not how I would choose|to seduce someone.
{35373}{35450}My firm intention|is to live forever.
{35453}{35484}Is that a promise?
{35487}{35549}Cross my heart.
{35812}{35850}You only think|you're in love with the poet.
{35853}{35914}You know that,|don't you?
{35917}{35938}His name's Dylan.
{35941}{35977}You can say Dylan,|can't you?
{35980}{36015}So, you admit|you're in love with him?
{36018}{36054}What are you,|a bloody lawyer, are you?
{36057}{36093}I'm not saying|I'm the better man,
{36096}{36173}but I'm not married,|Vera.
{36176}{36256}And you'll admit|that gives me an advantage.
{36259}{36300}I'll admit nothing.
{36303}{36366}On the grounds|that it may incriminate you?
{36369}{36453}You're trying to provoke me,|aren't you?
{36499}{36581}First love's all right|as far as it goes.
{36584}{36684}Last love, that's what|I'm interested in.
{36687}{36793}You think you're|so damn wise.
{37247}{37293}What do you want, Vera?
{37296}{37357}Oh, the moon|from out of the skies,
{37360}{37390}the stars in all their glitter.
{37393}{37451}What else?
{37454}{37522}It makes you know you're alive,|wanting.
{37525}{37555}That's what I think.
{37558}{37659}I'm alive all right,|every last bit of me.
{37727}{37800}Stay there.
{37880}{37902}Right, stay still.
{37905}{37987}All right.
{37990}{38070}Still.
{38177}{38211}I'm as good as he is.
{38214}{38242}Good as who is?
{38245}{38326}Dylan, the bugger.
{38331}{38389}He thinks that|I am put on this earth
{38392}{38458}to nurture his talent,
{38461}{38534}cook for him,|have his children,
{38537}{38559}clean for him.
{38562}{38615}That's all I'm here for.
{38618}{38722}Who's nurturing my bloody|talent?
{38725}{38748}What about your talent?
{38751}{38781}Will William nurture that?
{38784}{38834}I'll nurture my own.
{38858}{38923}Cut off his trigger finger,|that's what I'd do.
{38952}{38974}I would.
{38977}{39001}I'd come up|quietly in the night,
{39004}{39070}and I'd tie him down,|and I'd...
{39073}{39125}maim him.
{39341}{39375}Look at us.
{39378}{39426}How do they live up to us?
{39429}{39530}They don't, dirty tarts!
{39831}{39853}My brother died|for the likes of you!
{39856}{39897}I didn't bloody ask him to,|did I?
{39900}{39937}Bleeding conchie,|lick my boot.
{39940}{39978}Lick my bleeding boot!
{39981}{40077}Welsh seamen,|you can smell them a mile off.
{40080}{40107}I ain't got no quarrel with you.
{40110}{40143}Damn right, you don't.
{40146}{40176}What are you protecting him for,|scum, he is?
{40179}{40246}Get back to your drinking.|Now.
{40249}{40365}Go on.
{40380}{40411}He's right, you know.
{40414}{40466}Contamination,|that's what I am.
{40469}{40518}I'd stay well clear.
{40522}{40571}No, no, no, I'm just gonna|stay down here a moment.
{40574}{40642}Just...|just a little moment.
{40645}{40693}You're lying in piss, Dylan.
{40696}{40798}I've had worse beds.
{40842}{40887}I wouldn't like to get|on the wrong side of you.
{40890}{40936}Well, see you don't, then.
{40989}{41041}You bloody warriors.
{41044}{41075}You're a bunch|of buggering yes men.
{41078}{41129}You don't even know|what you're fighting for.
{41141}{41203}To live without fear,|me and mine.
{41206}{41250}Ta.
{41408}{41492}Oh, God.
{41495}{41602}Terrified, I am, of not...
{41605}{41648}not doing.
{41651}{41678}War, see, it's useful.
{41681}{41755}It gives the terror a focus.
{41758}{41786}Is she in there?
{41789}{41859}Vera?
{41862}{41917}All you heroes,
{41920}{41953}you think the women|just fall at your feet
{41956}{42003}at the sight of you, don't you?
{42006}{42058}You think they don't?
{42099}{42123}Of course,|if I could be born again,
{42126}{42161}I'd have a word with God.
{42164}{42207}"Make me a hero," I'd say.
{42210}{42271}This way is far too much|bloody hard work.
{42274}{42296}Come on.
{42299}{42362}What, go on living?
{42365}{42421}I've a cure for funk.
{42424}{42480}Death, that's the only cure.
{42483}{42528}- Double?|- You offering?
{43162}{43267}"Possessed by the skies
{43270}{43343}and taken by light|in her arms
{43346}{43407}at long and dear last,
{43410}{43475}I may without fail
{43478}{43608}suffer the first vision|that set fire to the stars."
{43699}{43751}Touch her,|and I'll kill you.
{43754}{43873}Caitlin's territory,|is she?
{43930}{44010}Caitlin's friend.
{45734}{45758}Here.
{45761}{45783}I can buy my own drink.
{45786}{45849}Just take the bloody thing.
{45941}{46030}- Care to dance?|- I'd love to, thank you.
{46069}{46127}Don't worry, they won't get us|down here.
{46479}{46524}- My round.|- Don't be childish.
{46527}{46568}Gin drinkers, are they,|the children you know?
{46571}{46628}Dance, come on.
{46631}{46663}I'm an independent woman.
{46666}{46705}I can buy a round if I want to.
{46708}{46733}And a fight?
{46736}{46775}You can have that too|if that's what you want.
{46778}{46821}All right, then.
{46824}{46891}After a dance.
{47178}{47211}I won't always|do as you say.
{47214}{47256}Thank you|for the warning.
{47259}{47307}I won't.
{47310}{47369}Just dance.
{48663}{48699}Come on, this way.
{48702}{48773}I need some help over here, now.
{48950}{48977}Vera!
{48980}{49002}Vera.
{49005}{49079}Vera, you can leave her now.
{49082}{49107}No, the pavement's wet.
{49110}{49182}No, she won't feel it.
{49198}{49286}Leave her now.
{49335}{49359}Come on.
{49362}{49390}It's all right.
{49393}{49423}It's all right.
{49426}{49515}It's all right.
{49518}{49550}It's all right.
{49553}{49630}All right.
{50618}{50712}I bet you lay this|on the ground.
{50715}{50758}Why would I do that?
{50761}{50829}For all the girls.
{50832}{50911}You won't get me on...
{51027}{51140}Those people, William.
{51148}{51235}All those people.
{51413}{51537}You've got a raindrop|running down down your cheek,
{51540}{51620}just like a tear.
{51800}{51891}Make love to me.
{53261}{53335}No harm will ever|come to you.
{53338}{53430}Not from me.|Not from anyone else.
{53433}{53516}Not while I'm here.
{53519}{53624}No word of mine|will ever hurt you.
{53627}{53712}That sounds like a vow.
{54645}{54697}"A stranger has come
{54700}{54811}to share my room in the house.
{55487}{55528}A stranger has come
{55531}{55588}to share my room in the house.
{55591}{55657}Not right in the head.
{55660}{55729}A girl mad as birds,
{55732}{55776}she has come possessed,
{55779}{55852}who admits the delusive light|through the bouncing wall
{55855}{55991}possessed by the skies.
{55994}{56096}And taken by light in her arms,|at long and dear last,
{56099}{56164}I may, without fail
{56167}{56302}suffer the first vision|that set fire to the stars."
{56353}{56483}I don't like it, Dylan.
{56514}{56559}I've another couple of lines|in my head
{56562}{56603}I'm not sure where to put.
{56606}{56651}It's not finished, then?
{56654}{56717}No, strictly speaking.
{56720}{56813}Don't write poems|for me anymore?
{56816}{56890}It's just a phase.
{56948}{56992}Come here.
{57059}{57168}Bring that body back to me.
{58587}{58640}Now.
{58932}{58969}It's a marriage license.
{58972}{59008}Special one.
{59011}{59037}No.
{59040}{59065}What?
{59068}{59094}You can't make me.
{59097}{59137}What if I can't love you?
{59140}{59193}I've been posted, Vera.
{59196}{59254}Well, that's a hell|of a proposal.
{59257}{59303}I... love...
{59306}{59329}you.
{59332}{59383}I am not marrying you.
{59386}{59484}No, you don't make|the decisions any more.
{59487}{59509}No.
{59512}{59564}- Now, say yes. Say yes.|- No.
{59567}{59593}- Say, "I'll marry you."|- No.
{59596}{59618}Say it. Say yes.
{59621}{59677}Say yes. Yes!
{59680}{59707}Yes!
{59710}{59741}Say yes!
{59744}{59765}Yes!
{59768}{59876}- Say yes!|- For God's sake, say yes!
{59944}{60016}My first was Augustus John.
{60019}{60084}Seduced me when I was 15,|the old goat.
{60087}{60150}It doesn't mean anything,|fucking.
{60153}{60195}It's not love.
{60198}{60247}I get an itch,|it's got to be scratched.
{60250}{60287}I'd do it myself,|only I'm too lazy.
{60290}{60339}Why bother, when you can get|someone else
{60342}{60376}to do it for you?
{60379}{60435}Nothing to do with love,|fucking?
{60438}{60503}Nothing.
{60523}{60604}Who was your first?
{60616}{60647}What?
{60650}{60683}You don't need to tell me.
{60686}{60750}I know it was Dylan.
{60785}{60823}We were kids.
{60826}{60877}Tents piled|in a beach hut.
{60880}{60904}Nice and comfy, then.
{60907}{60944}We were children,|still innocent.
{60947}{61042}We are still innocent,|me and Dylan.
{61045}{61074}I only want it as a memory.
{61077}{61107}I don't want it back.
{61110}{61148}Does William know?
{61151}{61211}Don't ever tell him.
{61214}{61288}I can forgive the past.|He won't.
{61365}{61451}The past I can forgive.
{61499}{61559}You warning me?
{61911}{61933}You love William,
{61936}{61958}don't you?
{61961}{61983}Well, you have to love someone.
{61986}{62008}These days you do.
{62011}{62093}You sure|you want to marry him?
{62166}{62204}I've never had|a best friend before.
{62207}{62248}Here.
{62251}{62319}See if I look like|a mermaid.
{62553}{62587}We've a couple|of cleaners
{62590}{62623}who'd be pleased|to act as witnesses.
{62626}{62726}They'll be here,|they will.
{62729}{62754}I'm sorry,
{62757}{62820}we've got|couples queuing up.
{62845}{62867}Sorry!
{62870}{62904}About bloody time.
{62907}{63017}See?
{63027}{63074}Look.|Bend down, can't you?
{63077}{63120}Three guineas|that cost me.
{63123}{63145}How many words is that
{63148}{63178}for a couple of feathers|and a piece of cloth?
{63181}{63203}Where did you get|three guineas?
{63206}{63228}He wrote a check.
{63231}{63284}It'll bounce, of course.
{63287}{63311}Oh, you look beautiful.
{63314}{63345}Tell her she looks beautiful.
{63348}{63370}She is beautiful.
{63373}{63402}Come on,|let's get married.
{63405}{63442}Actually it was Dylan's idea.|He chose it.
{63445}{63489}You always did have hats.
{63753}{63831}Would you mind awfully?
{63834}{63894}I'm terribly sorry.
{63897}{63978}Purely for old times' sake.
{64215}{64237}Sorry, old chap.
{64240}{64313}Call of duty.
{64316}{64361}Carry on, Sergeant.
{64458}{64506}Oh, treat me right,|can't you?
{64524}{64565}Oh, no, no!
{64568}{64590}I want to give a toast.
{64593}{64653}I'm going to squeeze|the life out of you.
{64656}{64686}- Yes, after the toast.|- Go on!
{64689}{64711}You're killing me.
{64714}{64736}Oh, go on,
{64739}{64828}you great Welsh bastard,|or I'll break you in two!
{64885}{64954}To all the things|that really matter.
{64957}{64979}And bugger the ones that don't.
{64982}{65011}Hear, hear.
{65014}{65036}Can you please get down?
{65039}{65061}Sing, and I might.
{65064}{65124}- Oh, God.|- Sing, Dullun, sing.
{65907}{65999}It's that old heiryth,
{66002}{66072}that old Welsh thing|they're always banging on about.
{66096}{66170}He hates the bloody place,|doesn't he?
{66176}{66268}Who doesn't?
{66296}{66388}But all he wants, see,|he wants back there.
{66391}{66489}She's no different.
{66492}{66527}Nope, you'll never|come between them,
{66530}{66585}not with them|being Welsh together.
{66588}{66642}Why should I|come between them?
{66645}{66732}'Course, you've always got me.
{66804}{66848}Perfect.
{66887}{66929}"For old times' sake,"
{66932}{66966}that's what he said.
{66969}{67009}No harm will ever come to you.
{67012}{67036}He'll always be my friend.
{67039}{67061}No word of mine
{67064}{67086}will ever hurt you.
{67089}{67159}I can still have friends.
{67303}{67385}You're crying.
{67388}{67425}Dreaming, that's all.
{67428}{67471}You're shaking.
{67474}{67538}It'll pass.
{67541}{67599}You'll come back to me.
{67602}{67696}I know you will.
{67699}{67768}Tell me the truth.
{67771}{67848}You're hurting me.
{67851}{67961}I want everything|to be open between us...
{67964}{68005}and fresh and clean.
{68008}{68040}Stop it.
{68043}{68106}You and your friend.
{68109}{68199}Tell me.
{68202}{68265}We were kids, William.
{68268}{68336}We were on a beach,|and it happened once.
{68339}{68441}That's all.
{68444}{68507}William.
{68510}{68611}Tell me you love me.
{68614}{68705}Come back alive|and I'll say it.
{68708}{68800}Come back to me,|I'll say anything you want.
{68803}{68879}And mean it?
{68882}{68984}Come back and see.
{71109}{71160}Sergeant, get these men|off the aircraft now!
{71163}{71210}Everybody off the plane!
{71213}{71237}"Of course you told me
{71240}{71277}because I asked.
{71280}{71358}I should have bitten out|my tongue.
{71361}{71415}You're all I love.
{71418}{71461}You're all my need.
{71464}{71525}You're what I see|in front of me.
{71528}{71612}And if I look over|my shoulder, there...
{71615}{71679}there, I can see your smile.
{71682}{71776}All honor I would give up|for you.
{71779}{71878}I could accept defeat|if you were by my side."
{72209}{72255}Vera.
{72670}{72708}Do you want me to come|and hold your head?
{72711}{72779}Christ, no!
{72946}{73022}Now you'll get fat
{73025}{73074}and Dylan won't love you|anymore.
{73111}{73158}You're a bitch.
{73161}{73248}It's the past|Dylan loves.
{73251}{73325}And you.
{73328}{73350}Doesn't love me at all.
{73353}{73452}When's William get back?
{73455}{73524}I keep writing.|No word.
{73527}{73624}Think he's dead?
{73627}{73705}We're still getting his pay.
{73708}{73824}Army wouldn't pay|a dead man.
{73827}{73875}You'll have|to stop singing.
{73878}{73939}I'll sing if I want.
{73942}{73966}They won't let you.
{73969}{74055}Not pregnant,|they won't.
{74058}{74104}I can't do this.
{74107}{74150}I can't.
{74153}{74184}A mother, me?|Look at me.
{74187}{74280}Well, get rid of it, then.
{74294}{74345}It's William's.
{74364}{74444}You love him.
{74447}{74476}I hate him.
{74479}{74557}Oh, God,|I hate him so much.
{74560}{74599}Look what he's done to me.
{74602}{74663}Don't laugh.
{74666}{74747}Don't damn well laugh!
{74750}{74785}I can't do this alone.|I can't.
{74788}{74874}I'm here, aren't I?
{74877}{74912}Let's go home, Caitlin.
{74915}{74937}I don't have a home.
{74940}{74974}Wales, Caitlin.
{74977}{75035}Are you insane, woman?
{75038}{75060}I've got money.
{75063}{75107}What, William's pay?
{75198}{75229}I've savings.
{75232}{75314}Of course I have.
{75345}{75367}Hold him!
{75370}{75423}Bloody hold him!
{75485}{75528}You'll have|the whole town hearing you!
{75531}{75609}Shut your damn mouth!
{75644}{75673}You see this here?
{75676}{75734}Yes.
{75917}{75961}Give it here.
{76140}{76171}Don't let go!
{76174}{76200}It's only a baby.
{76203}{76280}You scream if you want to, Vera.|You hear me?
{76511}{76612}"Please write to me.
{76622}{76662}They tell us what to write|to our boys,
{76665}{76706}so we keep your morale up.
{76709}{76745}It's our duty.
{76748}{76795}Damn duty, I say.
{76798}{76829}I'm no heroine, you see.
{76832}{76886}I'm fed up to the back teeth|of being on my own.
{76889}{76964}It's not|what I married you for.
{76967}{77019}Come home.
{77022}{77098}I've got something|I might want to say to you.
{77101}{77156}Remember?
{77159}{77227}You do remember, don't you?
{77230}{77252}Come home.
{77255}{77357}I want to touch you where|the rain fell on your skin.
{77360}{77432}Damn you for making me|feel this way.
{77435}{77527}Damn you to hell and back.
{77530}{77583}And back, William.
{77586}{77666}And back."
{77888}{77923}Down.
{77926}{77990}Down!
{77993}{78028}Man down!
{78031}{78107}Open fire!
{78307}{78361}No, sir.
{78532}{78573}"Forgive us your death
{78576}{78628}that myselves the believers
{78631}{78691}may hold it in a great flood
{78694}{78748}till the blood shall spurt
{78751}{78825}and the dust shall sing|like a bird.
{78828}{78920}As the grains blow,|as your death grows,
{78923}{78976}through our heart,
{78979}{79016}crying, your dying.
{79019}{79048}Cry.
{79051}{79177}Child beyond cockcrow|by the fire-dwarfed street
{79180}{79253}we chant the flying sea
{79256}{79335}in the body bereft."
{79649}{79742}Come on.
{79745}{79823}Sleep tight.
{79888}{79937}I'm hungry.
{79940}{80006}Baby is sleeping.
{80233}{80296}It's bloody freezing.
{80299}{80372}Bloody Wales.
{80435}{80509}When I was little, my da always|used to warm me like this.
{80512}{80552}You loved him?
{80555}{80592}Adored him.
{80595}{80622}I hated mine.
{80625}{80663}You didn't hate him,|not hate.
{80666}{80731}He was loathsome.
{80734}{80787}Pity you're not a man.
{80790}{80847}If you were a man,|I'd fancy you.
{80919}{80972}Don't think I didn't|know you were there.
{80975}{80997}I didn't.
{81000}{81032}I could smell him.
{81035}{81064}Come here, Dylan.
{81067}{81108}Let Vera smell you,
{81111}{81132}smell the woman on you.
{81135}{81157}Stop it.
{81160}{81196}She thinks I should twiddle|my thumbs while she...
{81199}{81254}What?
{81257}{81279}What?
{81282}{81305}Don't wake the kids, Dylan.
{81308}{81348}So where are they, Caitlin?
{81351}{81377}Where are|your little friends?
{81380}{81414}Come on, boys,|out you come.
{81417}{81507}Feeding time.
{81515}{81552}She's killing me, Vera!
{81555}{81600}I will kill you!|I will!
{81603}{81645}If I catch you at it again,|I will!
{81648}{81683}Why don't you see to the kids,|Caitlin?
{81686}{81728}Go on.
{81767}{81813}Why do you do it?
{81816}{81909}I don't do anything.
{81912}{82001}I do it,|sleep with other women...
{82004}{82063}- Hello.|- Morning.
{82066}{82157}Because I'm a poet,|and a poet feeds off life.
{82184}{82206}What?
{82209}{82267}Pompous sod, aren't you?
{82270}{82341}I do it because she does it.
{82344}{82385}She always has.
{82388}{82414}She can't help herself.
{82417}{82490}It doesn't mean anything to her.
{82493}{82545}You don't need William.
{82548}{82608}You've got me.
{82611}{82663}Nothing but you and me|with time on our hands
{82666}{82741}and each other|to spend it with.
{82928}{82972}Hello, Daisy.
{83120}{83159}Come back with me.
{83162}{83226}Come on.
{83229}{83333}I'll take you back|to a time when we were safe,
{83336}{83383}where no bombs fell|from the sky,
{83386}{83453}and no one died,|ever.
{83456}{83587}You can't go back.
{83590}{83656}We can.
{83659}{83723}You and me.
{83726}{83790}It's not real.
{83793}{83868}It is if we want it to be.
{84239}{84291}Pity about|the poor bloody husband.
{84294}{84332}Off bleeding|for his country
{84335}{84388}and paying for the fun|back home.
{84453}{84519}Don't mind if I join you,|do you?
{85139}{85259}Room for a small one?
{85262}{85363}Wartime luxury.
{85745}{85824}You can drop me here.
{85958}{86048}- Cat?|- That looks nasty.
{86051}{86114}Catty, Catty.|Cat, Cat, Cat.
{86117}{86193}Cat, Catty.
{86225}{86294}God, you're drunk|in charge of a bike.
{86297}{86365}And what are you|drunk in charge of?
{86436}{86458}Am I hurting you?
{86461}{86486}You can't hurt her.
{86489}{86538}She's got skin like|a rhinoceros hide.
{86678}{86714}We're only friends,|Dylan and me,
{86717}{86794}you know that,|don't you?
{86797}{86866}Don't ever lie to me.
{86869}{86929}I won't. Not ever.
{86932}{86986}Friends don't lie|to each other.
{86989}{87033}Still as you can now.
{87287}{87374}Tell him to come back, Rowatt.
{87470}{87561}Tell your daddy|to come back to me.
{87564}{87622}Think he sees it, lovely?
{87625}{87693}Your daddy?
{87696}{87818}You think he sees the rain?
{87830}{87878}Mama, Dada.
{87881}{87919}Caitlin, shut it up!
{87922}{87978}You're its father!|Play with him!
{87981}{88003}That's what he wants.
{88006}{88037}I'm writing!
{88040}{88071}Damn it, Dylan.
{88074}{88141}Daddy! Mummy!
{88144}{88188}That's my only...
{88191}{88236}Dada.
{88239}{88263}That's my only draft!
{88266}{88315}You'll find it|in the cesspit, then,
{88318}{88342}along with my only life!
{88345}{88402}Cat! Cat!
{88425}{88469}Cat!
{89321}{89398}When I was a windy boy and a bit
{89401}{89485}and the black spit|of the chapel fold,
{89488}{89606}sighed the old ram rod|dying of women,
{89661}{89744}I tiptoed shy|in the gooseberry wood.
{89747}{89844}The rude owl cried|like a telltale tit.
{89847}{89923}I skipped in a blush|as the big girls rolled
{89926}{90017}ninepin down|on the donkeys' common.
{90020}{90102}And on seesaw Sunday nights|I wooed
{90105}{90182}whoever I would|with my wicked eyes.
{90185}{90245}The whole of the moon|I could love and leave...
{90248}{90281}For God's sake,
{90284}{90318}don't wake Rowatt.
{90321}{90353}All the green-leaved
{90356}{90394}little weddings' wives
{90397}{90541}in the coal black bush|and let them grieve.
{90603}{90647}Wash my back for me?
{90856}{90954}There is nothing|like a proper sponge.
{91049}{91075}Give us a kiss,|Vera Phillips.
{91078}{91118}Give us a penny, then.
{91121}{91173}I haven't got a penny.
{91201}{91276}Like we used to be.
{91279}{91362}Little dog says,|"Play with me."
{91365}{91464}That's all you'll get.
{91467}{91515}And don't you wet|my jumper.
{91518}{91550}We've had baths together before.
{91553}{91602}We were children then.
{91605}{91633}I made love to you|on a beach.
{91636}{91719}Once, and it was cold.
{91722}{91744}So lonely.
{91747}{91784}Not for you.
{91787}{91815}Aching with it, you are.
{91818}{91840}No, Dylan.
{91843}{91871}No what?
{91874}{91917}Don't make mischief.
{91920}{91986}There's no harm in it.
{91989}{92071}You're getting me wet.
{92097}{92181}Walk away, then.
{92184}{92245}Go on, Vera Phillips.
{92248}{92341}Walk away.
{92367}{92402}You want us all to love you.
{92405}{92477}So I can love you back.
{92615}{92702}All right, then.
{92705}{92800}Love me.
{93549}{93598}Look at me. I'm soaking!
{95468}{95544}Vera!
{96843}{96911}Hello.
{97175}{97266}Where have you been?
{97274}{97335}Nowhere.
{97460}{97499}I'm going to make laver bread.
{97502}{97587}Look.
{97590}{97686}No, don't.
{97689}{97813}Have you been crying?
{97816}{97903}They're sending William home.
{98073}{98105}I've never seen a man|love anyone
{98108}{98149}the way I saw|that man love you.
{98152}{98237}I'm not that me anymore.
{98309}{98414}I've got Rowatt.
{98417}{98498}Just tell him|you love him, Vera.
{98508}{98574}What if it's too late?
{98620}{98699}It's never too late.
{98847}{98902}It's cold! It's cold!
{98905}{98946}Of course it's bloody cold!
{98949}{99033}Catty!
{99161}{99261}I'm pregnant, you know.
{99264}{99346}Oh, God, Cat.
{99349}{99405}Whose is it?
{99408}{99486}Don't know.
{99489}{99510}Can't have it, of course.
{99513}{99572}I won't have it.
{99628}{99655}I need money, Vera.
{99658}{99718}Do you know someone?
{99753}{99775}He costs.
{99778}{99799}Is he safe?
{99802}{99841}Just say if you can't help.
{99844}{99919}I'll do it myself.
{99922}{99959}Maybe Wilfred knows how,|he's a vet.
{99962}{99999}What did you bother|with him for?
{100002}{100105}He's no bother.
{100108}{100182}Come on,|we'll go to the bank.
{100475}{100556}I'd tell you you'd get it back,|but you wouldn't believe me.
{100559}{100654}Treats. Come on.
{101127}{101205}It's like I only|half remember him.
{101208}{101240}Dark.
{101243}{101335}Good-looking.|Dangerous.
{101338}{101373}Can't live on memories,|though, can you?
{101376}{101430}There's only|so many of them.
{101433}{101526}Use yourself up|living on memories.
{101529}{101595}It'd be a better place,|a world without men.
{101598}{101623}Possibly.
{101626}{101748}Dylan, see,|sex for him's a giggle.
{101751}{101894}He makes a joke of it,|whoever it's with.
{101990}{102050}Bet William's romantic.
{102111}{102246}I can't remember.
{103034}{103150}I think Daddy is very lucky.
{103314}{103407}Oh, God, look, Rowatt.
{103410}{103439}Who's that funny woman?
{103442}{103516}Who is she?
{103758}{103814}William.
{103874}{103955}It's me.
{104012}{104085}I know.
{104184}{104242}Well, then.
{105346}{105418}Can't you put him down?
{105421}{105499}He'll only cry.
{105784}{105833}What's that?
{105887}{105931}It's a collage...
{105937}{105995}for you.
{106348}{106424}Hold me, William.
{106457}{106487}I should deal with the post.
{106490}{106581}Let them wait.
{107217}{107303}In my craft or sullen art
{107306}{107390}exercised in the still night
{107393}{107438}when only the moon rages
{107441}{107467}and the lovers lie abed...
{107470}{107497}William?
{107500}{107528}With all their griefs
{107531}{107591}in their arms,
{107594}{107676}I labor by singing light,
{107679}{107732}not for ambition nor bread
{107735}{107869}or the strut and trade of charms|on the ivory stages,
{107872}{108015}but for the common wages|of their most secret heart.
{108676}{108742}You all right?
{108745}{108789}Are you?
{108792}{108842}I will be.
{108845}{108926}Will you?
{108929}{108972}I don't know where he is.
{108975}{109022}Give him time.
{109025}{109078}He's changed.
{109081}{109126}So have you.
{109129}{109188}He doesn't love me anymore.
{109191}{109265}Everybody loves you.
{109268}{109322}And Dylan,|everybody loves him.
{109416}{109460}Oh, God!
{109474}{109573}Oh, Catty.
{109611}{109692}Does it hurt?
{109695}{109798}I didn't think|it would mean anything.
{109801}{109890}'Course, it's a relief.
{109953}{110063}I'll stop.
{110066}{110162}In a minute, I will.
{110257}{110308}There, see?
{110311}{110407}Happy Caitlin.
{111081}{111138}Let's throw that.
{111377}{111421}Sorry, I...
{111652}{111717}I'm sorry.
{111720}{111791}I can't remember when I last...
{112008}{112079}Shall we have some tea?
{112898}{112928}All you heroes,
{112931}{112992}you think the women|just fall at your feet.
{113034}{113108}He'll always be my friend,|Dylan.
{113217}{113246}It's a fox.
{113249}{113325}It's a fox, that's all.
{113491}{113546}What's wrong, William?
{113549}{113610}Talk to me.
{113613}{113654}Please.
{115573}{115626}What did you want me for?
{115629}{115690}Was it the money?
{115693}{115748}Was that it?|Was that all?
{115751}{115803}Don't... don't wake Rowatt.
{115806}{115911}My money to keep your tame poet.
{115914}{115999}Oh, I had better offers,|richer offers.
{116002}{116048}You?
{116051}{116122}Have you looked at yourself?
{116181}{116225}They're my friends.
{116261}{116283}I bought them food.
{116286}{116347}- You have to feed people.|- I've nothing left.
{116401}{116422}You've got Rowatt!
{116425}{116462}At least look at him, William!
{116465}{116526}Why can't you hold him?
{116529}{116588}Is he Dylan's?
{116591}{116630}That's what they're saying|out there, Vera.
{116633}{116698}"He's Dylan's child."
{116764}{116802}I love you.
{116805}{116842}When did that happen?
{116845}{116898}I said come back|and I'd say it.
{116901}{117001}I said!
{117004}{117053}You've been with him.
{117097}{117170}Haven't you?
{117550}{117589}What do they want, blood?
{117592}{117630}A finished script.
{117633}{117672}For God's sake, man,|you've been paid for it!
{117675}{117699}Yes, but not enough.
{117702}{117724}Be that as it may...
{117727}{117754}It's like doing|my homework.
{117757}{117805}It's not even broken down|into scenes yet, Dylan.
{117808}{117855}That's because I'm not|a secretary, Anita!
{117858}{117915}Well, I'm not|a bloody writer!
{118993}{119018}I'm looking for Dylan Thomas.
{119021}{119077}On the house,|Captain Killick.
{119099}{119166}Ah, yes, the returning hero.
{119169}{119218}There'll be another|when you've finished.
{119225}{119269}The least we can do.
{119344}{119388}Where is he?
{119391}{119418}There it is.
{119421}{119465}Waiting for you, see?
{119468}{119528}It's the specter of communism.
{119531}{119588}That's what frightens them,|the Allies.
{119591}{119628}Two pints of bitter
{119631}{119653}and a gin and tonic.
{119656}{119693}Make mine brains.
{119696}{119728}Greece. Now, Greece.
{119731}{119812}It's the communist partisans|that risk their lives
{119815}{119866}to fight the Germans,|not the British Tommy.
{119869}{119916}What they're aiming for,
{119919}{119986}secretly, the Allies,
{119989}{120041}is for the Germans|to wipe out the partisans,
{120044}{120093}wipe out the communists,
{120096}{120153}so they won't have|to deal with them
{120156}{120235}after the war.
{120266}{120310}You listen to me.
{120323}{120448}I held a boy while my sergeant|hacked his arm off.
{120461}{120488}Later I held him|while he died.
{120491}{120553}British boy, he was.
{120556}{120598}That was in Greece.
{120601}{120641}I beg your pardon?
{120644}{120686}We fight...
{120689}{120771}out there...
{120774}{120821}so you and your friends can...
{120824}{120884}can sit around in Hampstead|and theorize.
{120887}{120920}You do that
{120923}{120998}while we bleed|our lives away.
{121001}{121103}What do you know about war?
{121125}{121215}You people,|what do you know about war?
{121313}{121387}Drink up, boys and girls,|drink up.
{121390}{121453}Introduce me to your|knowledgeable friends, Dylan.
{121456}{121520}Please, introduce me.|I'd be charmed to meet them.
{121523}{121566}I'll introduce you|just as soon as you calm down.
{121569}{121628}You can take my money.
{121652}{121678}You can take my bloody money,
{121681}{121746}but you can't even introduce me|to your friends?
{121756}{121829}I'm just a bloody Tommy.
{121842}{121864}Time, gentlemen!
{121867}{121924}Gentlemen, please.|It's time.
{121927}{121968}- Whisky, double.|- Time's called.
{121971}{122023}Are you refusing to serve me?
{122026}{122067}- I said time's called.|- What do you mean, time?
{122070}{122136}Go home, Captain Killick.
{122163}{122225}No, don't you laugh at me.
{122228}{122309}Oh, play the big man.
{122312}{122352}Come on.
{122355}{122400}Easy in front of a woman,|isn't it?
{122403}{122443}We only have|your word for it
{122446}{122510}that you weren't|skulking at the back
{122513}{122623}with urine|running down your leg.
{122712}{122751}William, come on.
{122754}{122842}Don't bother with them,|Captain Killick.
{122851}{122903}Best off home.
{123484}{123519}William?|What in heaven's name?
{123522}{123544}Take your hands off me.
{123547}{123622}- Put it down!|- Please, take your hands off.
{123625}{123653}Put the damn thing down!
{123656}{123726}Vera!
{123729}{123776}Vera?
{123779}{123871}Vera?
{124132}{124214}Give me words,|and I'm a giant.
{124221}{124249}Above all women.
{124252}{124318}Words.
{124321}{124346}Beyond the bottle.
{124349}{124426}More than love.|Better than sex.
{124444}{124472}Words...
{124475}{124522}for me.
{124640}{124665}Shall I tell you about
{124668}{124736}our first night together|at the Wheatsheaf?
{124739}{124822}She offered her honor,|so I honored her offer.
{124825}{124877}All that long,|I've got her on offer.
{124898}{124937}Very easily entertained,|this one.
{124940}{124973}Thinks a pint of Guinness|with a potato in it
{124976}{125006}is a cocktail.
{125009}{125089}Don't you, my darling?
{125261}{125297}William, no!
{125300}{125342}No! No!
{125578}{125600}No!
{125603}{125650}No! No! No!
{125660}{125693}William, no, stop, please.
{125696}{125753}Please stop!
{125806}{125830}No one here means you any harm.
{125833}{125899}Please.
{125922}{125968}Don't you care?
{126011}{126085}Your husband and my wife.
{126330}{126374}My son.
{126679}{126750}You've got a bruise.
{126753}{126804}Take me home.
{126807}{126881}Did I do that?
{126925}{126979}Take her home, William.
{127035}{127094}Not without my gun.
{127141}{127178}Give me the gun...
{127181}{127240}or I'll pull the pin on this
{127243}{127308}and kill the lot of us.
{127311}{127398}My son.
{127503}{127562}What'd you give it to her for,|you daft sod?
{127645}{127667}There isn't a pin in it,
{127670}{127715}William.
{127758}{127804}Either it's faulty or...
{127807}{127832}it's just gone off,
{127835}{127918}and we're standing here dead,|looking at it.
{127974}{128069}Mommy!
{128164}{128223}Look, the boy's screaming.
{128417}{128479}Come home, William.
{128482}{128535}William.
{129211}{129279}All they care about is
{129282}{129332}keeping the lid on it, but...
{129335}{129395}that's Wales for you.
{129398}{129444}Doesn't want the world|knowing its business.
{129447}{129517}I mean,|we could have been killed.
{129525}{129572}Cat.
{129575}{129649}I haven't got any more money.
{129728}{129860}I've nothing left, Dylan.
{130985}{131040}Got your toe.
{131043}{131124}Got your toe.
{131641}{131685}Can I...
{131688}{131780}Hold him, then.
{131942}{132052}See?
{132055}{132129}You won't hurt him.
{132293}{132376}Thank you.
{132456}{132500}Shall we take him out?
{132571}{132639}Now.
{132982}{133051}You're an expert.
{133120}{133180}Eyelashes like feathers,
{133183}{133235}like yours.
{133271}{133318}Captain Killick,|it's the police.
{133321}{133343}Open up.
{133346}{133411}Oh, God.
{133414}{133467}One way to get rid of me?
{133470}{133521}William.
{133524}{133595}I love you.
{133649}{133713}Come here.
{134743}{134804}Don't think I don't understand.
{134812}{134878}His kind of violence, I mean.
{134883}{134922}I do.
{134925}{135014}It's just I've never had|a Sten gun handy.
{135049}{135114}Tea's got scum on it.
{135153}{135221}He's a beauty.
{135276}{135350}Does William think he's Dylan's?
{135405}{135466}Is he Dylan's?
{135469}{135537}No.
{135606}{135658}I've used up all the sugar.
{135749}{135811}Were you sleeping with him?
{135852}{135934}I love my husband.
{136054}{136129}I should kill you.
{136142}{136219}You're my friend.
{136222}{136246}For lying...
{136249}{136356}I mean.
{136418}{136548}For lying to me, Vera.
{137144}{137173}You look smart.
{137176}{137228}Quite your old self.
{137375}{137419}I recovered
{137422}{137479}five empty bullet cases from the gravel.
{137482}{137548}The walls being made|of wood and asbestos,
{137551}{137595}the bullets had penetrated|through to the living room,
{137598}{137632}where I also found
{137635}{137688}five more|empty bullet cases.
{137691}{137783}All with him,|aren't they?
{137786}{137816}The whole bloody village.
{137819}{137861}I'm the bard, aren't I?
{137864}{137906}They've only just met him.
{137914}{137964}A revolver, a grenade,
{137967}{138058}and 100 rounds|of 9-millimeter ammunition.
{138110}{138136}Used to lay minefields,
{138139}{138204}Captain Killick.
{138211}{138262}When he left an area, though,
{138265}{138362}he used to dig up|the mines he'd laid.
{138365}{138389}Why don't you take
{138392}{138415}the witness box
{138418}{138467}and sing Killick's praises|to his judgeship?
{138470}{138503}Why don't you do that?
{138506}{138528}Everybody loves a hero.
{138531}{138554}Are you telling me
{138557}{138589}Captain Killick didn't know
{138592}{138631}he had to hand in|his weapons?
{138634}{138683}Captain William Killick|is an expert marksman.
{138686}{138718}If he'd been intent on murder,
{138721}{138752}he couldn't possibly|have failed.
{138755}{138778}I'd be obliged|if you confine yourself
{138781}{138820}to answering|the questions I ask,
{138823}{138879}Lieutenant Colonel.
{138882}{138913}Scratch my head, Cat.
{138916}{138994}Can't.
{139200}{139234}Is there any reason
{139237}{139282}why a man of your rank
{139285}{139358}should strike a woman|in the face?
{139361}{139395}No, sir.
{139398}{139460}Why did you go to the Thomas|bungalow so late at night?
{139482}{139531}I have no idea why.
{139534}{139578}They cut me dead.
{139601}{139630}I suppose|they didn't want to see
{139633}{139671}the goose that lay|the golden egg.
{139674}{139774}I thought I'd show them|that war is real.
{139777}{139855}I could see there was|no one in my line of fire,
{139858}{139906}so I fired at a partition.
{139909}{139973}I never imagined the bullets|would penetrate the wall.
{139976}{140011}The walls were asbestos,|Captain Killick.
{140014}{140059}I didn't know that.
{140062}{140118}I wanted to frighten them, that's all.
{140121}{140192}There was a child present.
{140241}{140354}Is... is that a question, sir?
{140582}{140692}I can't live without him.
{140695}{140742}Did you know|the entire unit were killed
{140745}{140820}when they|went back out there?
{140823}{140871}Wiped out.
{140874}{140941}That would have been him.
{140944}{141004}I'm begging you|to help him.
{141007}{141083}It saved his life,|this trial.
{141086}{141153}Did him a favor.
{141202}{141262}Dylan...
{141265}{141314}please.
{141640}{141692}You were the star in my sky.
{141755}{141811}You can't stay the same|all your life.
{141825}{141913}I can.
{141955}{142035}You'll help him, won't you?
{142061}{142123}It means that much to you?
{142126}{142223}William's my world,
{142226}{142299}him and Rowatt.
{142302}{142350}I've no room|for anyone else.
{142353}{142512}I don't want anyone else.
{142624}{142708}I see.
{142711}{142801}I do, I see.
{142970}{143050}Mr. Thomas?
{143326}{143453}Captain Killick and I|were no more than acquaintances.
{143493}{143544}We would occasionally stand|next to each other at the bar.
{143547}{143620}Captain Killick|was stone-cold sober
{143623}{143646}on the night of the shooting,
{143649}{143750}and it is my firm belief|that he tried to kill me,
{143753}{143805}that he tried to kill my wife,
{143808}{143903}and that he tried|to kill my son.
{144033}{144059}Why?
{144062}{144175}You.
{144178}{144242}Leave Caitlin.
{144245}{144302}Go on.
{144305}{144375}Leave Caitlin.
{144378}{144407}You've got rid|of the opposition.
{144410}{144482}Now you come on.
{144485}{144598}Leave your wife|and live with me.
{144701}{144829}Do you see?
{144832}{144950}You want a 15-year-old girl|back on the beach,
{144953}{145050}not me.
{145053}{145176}You don't even see me,|do you, Dylan?
{145252}{145390}All you've got|is stories in your head, words.
{145393}{145496}And I have to be real.
{145499}{145622}William makes me real.
{145780}{145922}If you have sent|my beloved husband to jail...
{145929}{146018}I will never forgive you.
{146494}{146556}It is my opinion
{146559}{146604}that it is not|an innocent hand
{146607}{146683}that wields a gun|against a civilian household.
{146717}{146752}It is, however,|your peers who judge you,
{146755}{146780}Captain Killick,
{146783}{146842}and not I.
{146845}{146880}They have found|that there is no evidence
{146883}{146968}to support the charge|of attempted murder.
{146971}{147008}I have, therefore,|no choice
{147011}{147150}but to pronounce you free to go.
{150377}{150449}There's that smile.
{150452}{150557}I never meant to hurt you.
{150560}{150648}Might as well, I suppose.
{150651}{150737}Smile, I mean.
{150740}{150784}Write, Catty.
{150803}{150849}I'll leave that to Dylan.
{150852}{150917}Write to me.
{151214}{151287}Don't be lonely.
{151383}{151456}Don't you, Catty.
{151530}{151594}Don't you.
{151964}{152031}Not for the proud man apart
{152034}{152089}from the raging moon I write
{152092}{152150}on these spindrift pages,
{152153}{152204}nor for the towering dead
{152207}{152315}with their nightingales|and psalms,
{152318}{152385}but for the lovers,
{152388}{152492}their arms round|the griefs of the ages.
