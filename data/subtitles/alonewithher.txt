Oh, my God, this is so cold!



What?



Get over here.



Go get it!



Come here, <i>perro</i>.
You wanna play some more?



Shit.



<i>Southland traffic, crash downtown L.A...</i>



- Good morning.
- <i>...east 101 at Coldwater...</i>



<i>I had to call,</i>
<i>because I'm experiencing the same thing,</i>



<i>and I could use your advice, bro...</i>



- <i>Can you blame her?</i>
- <i>No, I guess not.</i>



<i>You have to change the way you think.</i>
<i>If a woman sees that you're...</i>



Can I help you?



Yeah, my wife and I
would like to, you know,



keep an eye on our nanny
while we're away from the house.



Right, right.



We have all kinds of household objects
with built-in cameras.



Or you could do it yourself.



You can hide this one in anything--



you know, TV, clock-radio, VCR,
whatever.



How much is this?



This one goes for sixty-nine bucks,
and it comes with the receiver.



Hmm. Do-- do I--
do I need a license or something?



No, you're good to go.
It's totally legal.



<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It's hard. I mean--</i>



<i>Dan, you have to find out</i>
<i>what's important to her, okay?</i>



<i>I mean, you have to pay close attention</i>



<i>and really listen to what she says</i>
<i>with an open mind,</i>



<i>...some guys that actually</i>
<i>keep a small notebook handy,</i>



<i>and whenever they notice something</i>
<i>important to the girl...</i>



Beautiful.



Testing... testing.



Ahh.



No! Bad boy!



Bad boy! Ohh!



<i>¡Perro feo, eso no se hace!</i>



<i>Sólo que hay un tráfico terrible.</i>



Eso es Los Ángeles, ¿eh?



<i>Bueno.</i>



¿Ya trancaste las puertas?



- <i>Sí, mamá.</i>
- ¿Las dos?



<i>So, any sex with the ex?</i>



Shut up.



- <i>Did you see him?</i>
- No, thank God.



<i>Good. No drunk dialing either,</i>
<i>right?</i>



Yeah, Jen,



I got hammered with my parents
and snuck up to my room.



<i>I wouldn't put it past you.</i>



- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- <i>No, no, don't.</i>



Mmm.



Me too. It was very, very powerful.



Yes, me too. Very powerful.



How did you like the wedding speech?



How did you like the wedding--



That's a great movie you have there.



I just saw it last night.



- Oh, me too.
- Really?



Yeah. It was very powerful.



God, tell me about it.



My eyes were so puffy by the end
that I looked like a boxer.



Cafe latte for Terrence.



How did you like
the wedding speech?



Oh, that was my favorite part.



- Big surprise.
- Totally.



Doug, double cappuccino.



- Well, uh, have a great day.
- You too.



Thanks.



- What do you think?
- I think you look really hot.



I don't like this, either.



Ohh, I just don't feel good.



Whatever. Guys love sad girls.
You're nice and vulnerable.



Where's my boy?
Where is my boy?



Where's my boy?
Where's my boy...



Mmm...



Ohh... ohh...



Hey. How's it going?



Hi. Good. How are you?



Not too bad.



Seen any good movies lately?



Uh, well, I-- I saw <i>Shampoo Village</i>
during the weekend.



That's so funny. Me too.



Oh. What did you think?



Oh...



- You?
- Same.



I felt like they were trying too hard.



That's exactly what I said.



And that whole road trip thing
just really didn't work for me.



It didn't work. I know.



Next customer!



- Hello.
- Hi. Yes, can I please have



- a double tall cappuccino, please?
- Okay.



- And your name?
- Doug.



- Amy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Amy.



So, what kind of music
are you into?



Oh, uh, all kinds.



Basically whatever's on the radio,
whatever's popular.



Yeah.



- You?
- Same.



- Yeah?
- Yeah. A bit of everything. Totally.



There's this band that
I just discovered a few weeks ago,



they're really good.



They're kind of obscure.
They're called Skinny.



- Shut <i>up</i>!
- What?



- I love them!
- You do?



Yeah! I have every one of their CDs.



- Huh. Really. Me too.
- That's so funny!



Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I bought all mine
on the same day.



Holy shit!



Yeah, when I find a band
and they've got a lot of CDs



but I'm just finding out about 'em,



I just go and buy all the CDs
in one fell swoop, 'cause--



Doug, double cappuccino.



- That's you.
- Yeah.



- Uh-huh.
- Well, um, it was nice talking to you.



Yeah. I guess I'll see you around,
huh?



Yes. I can't wait to hear about
your taste in books.



Yeah.



- Bye.
- Take care.



So I met a guy
in the coffee shop today.



- <i>Was he cute?</i>
- I don't know. He's okay, I guess.



It's not like that. We just
had a lot in common,



like movies and music--
the exact same taste.



- <i>That's awesome.</i>
- And he loves that band Skinny.



<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Nobody knows about them.</i>



- Yeah.
- <i>So, do you like him?</i>



I hardly know him, Jen.



Seriously, I mean, I've talked to him
for like five minutes, total.



<i>Amy, swear to God. If you don't</i>
<i>give this a chance</i>



<i>I'm gonna kick your ass.</i>



Oh, shit.



- Hello?
- <i>What up, girl?</i>



- What?
- <i>I asked you first.</i>



- Who is this?
- <i>Ouch. That hurts.</i>



- Matt?
- <i>How's it goin', dude?</i>



Who are you calling "dude"?



<i>So listen, unless you got a policy</i>
<i>against dating coworkers,</i>



<i>what do you say we go out</i>
<i>tomorrow night?</i>



<i>You know, a little dinner, movie,</i>
<i>candlelight...</i>



Well, I gotta say it's kinda short notice,
you know?



<i>Man, you're gonna make me squirm,</i>
<i>aren't ya?</i>



<i>Well, that's cool.</i>
<i>I'll just go stick my head in the oven.</i>



Well, I suppose I can
juggle a few things.



<i>No pressure.</i>



<i>So, what time does this</i>
<i>night of magic begin?</i>



<i>Let's see... pick you up at eight?</i>



<i>Sure.</i>



Hey.



What's up, dude?



So I'm a dude now, huh?



- No, I was just--
- What's up, dude? Ha ha!



- It's just an expression.
- I know. I'm sorry.



I'm just kidding. How's it going?



Good. Good.
Thank God it's Friday, huh?



Yeah, thank God.
What are you doing this weekend?



Well, tonight I thought we'd catch
our favorite band at Red Bar.



- What?
- Yeah, Skinny.



I just happen to have
an extra ticket to their show,



so, uh... you wanna come?



- Are you serious?
- Yes.



Yes, I was gonna go with my friend,
but he's sick,



and I know what a big fan you are,
so I thought you might like to go...



with me.



Oh, my God, Doug,
that's so sweet of you.



The show starts at ten,
so maybe we can grab some dinner first



or some drinks, or...



What?



I'm sorry, Doug, I can't go.



I made plans and there's
just no way I can break them.



Not even for Skinny?



It sucks, I know.



Well, they're only playing in town
for one night, so it--



It's a family thing.



They don't live here, and if I cancel,
they'd just kill me, you know?



I'm sorry.



It's okay.



- Any other night would be great.
- Yeah. Another night.



I know it's short notice,
I just thought, uh...



Well, I know someone else who would--
who would love to go, so...



don't worry about it.



- Really?
- Yeah. It's...



- You mean it?
- Yes. It's no big deal.



Don't-- look, I-- I better get goin'.
I have a meeting across town.



Okay. I'm sorry. I won't keep you.



No, no. It's okay.



Okay.



- Have a great weekend.
- Yeah, you too.



Bye.



Augghh! Fuck!



Fuck! Fuck!



- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Matt.



- <i>Yeah?</i>
- It's Amy.



<i>Hey! You ready to rock?</i>



Oh, God--



<i>Jesus Christ.</i>



I had to do it, Amy.



I'll make it better, I promise.



That's--



That's very nice of you. Thank you.



Thank you very much.



No, no, I-- I--
I can't ask you to do that.



No. Thank you. But--



Hey, stranger.



Hi, Amy. How are you?



Great. You?



- Well, I'm a bit nervous, actually.
- Why?



I called a cab twenty minutes ago,
but, uh...



What happened to your car?



I-- I don't know.



Oh-- be careful.



I don't know. I think the starter's broken.



I have a meeting in ten minutes
I can't miss, so I'm sorta...



Oh, geez.



Yeah.



You want a ride?



Oh-- no. No.
I-- I can't ask you to do that.



Well, you didn't ask. I offered.



Huh. Hmm.



- Where ya goin'?
- UCLA.



Well, that's right on my way.
Perfect. Seriously.



- Come on.
- Yeah?



- You're gonna be late.
- Okay, okay.



What are you studying?



Oh, no, I'm not a student.



I'm a sales rep for
a small publishing house.



I go to colleges and push our textbooks.



- Cool.
- Well, I don't know about "cool."



It pays the bills
and the hours are good,



so it lets me do what I love
on the side.



- What's that?
- Photography.



Oh, cool. I mean it this time.
What kind of photography?



Mostly black and white landscapes.



Really. Would I have seen
any of your work?



No, no, I--



Fuck.



I'm so sorry. Are you all right?



- Yeah.
- You sure you still want a ride?



Yeah-- yes, of course.
I think you're a great driver.



You know, I just put up a web site,
if you want to take a look.



Oh. I've been talking about
getting my own site for months.



- No, really?
- Yeah.



- For what?
- Painting.



- I paint on the side.
- Oh, wow.



I would be happy to do yours for you.
I'd only charge you a million bucks.



Nah.



No, I mean, it's the least I can do
after you saved my butt this morning.



All you need to do is
put your artwork on CD for me.



Well, actually,
I've already done that.



Well, great. Then just give me the CD
and let me do the rest.



God, I mean, he's such a nice guy.



I just hope I'm not giving him
the wrong idea, you know?



<i>What does that mean?</i>



I can't put my finger on it.



There's just something
a bit off about him.



<i>Well, look,</i>
<i>nobody's saying</i> marry <i>the guy.</i>



<i>Just have some fun, you know?</i>



<i>I mean, don't burn the bridge.</i>



<i>You don't know where</i>
<i>this thing with Matt is gonna go.</i>



<i>He could end up being, like...</i>
<i>really annoying.</i>



Oh, and thanks for
your message on Friday.



I really appreciate it, you know.



<i>Well, I think you're</i>
<i>an amazing artist.</i>



- Oh, stop it.
- <i>As a matter of fact,</i>



<i>I've got something I want to show you.</i>



- Hey.
- Hi.



Come on in.



Oh, hey. Oh! Hi!



What a-- wow, what a cool place.



- Thanks.
- Yeah.



- Whoa.
- Oh, sorry about that.



- Rocky, go to your bed.
- No, it's okay, I love dogs.



- Hey.
- Can I take your jacket?



No, I'm fine, thank you. I'm okay.



- You look nice.
- Thank you.



- So do you.
- Yeah, right.



Can I get you a drink?



Oh, uh, yeah, sure.
Just whatever you're having.



- It's like he knows you.
- Yeah.



Are you hiding a steak
in your pocket, or what?



Ha. No, no, nothin' like that.



Oh, my God.



I wanted to try and use
the same sort of tone as your paintings,



the same conceptual design,
and your color scheme...



It's just perfect, you know?
Absolutely perfect.



You see this little flash animation thing?



I don't know what to say.
I mean...



thank you.



- Thank you so much.
- No, it's my pleasure.



Um...



there's no way I'm paying you
fifty bucks for <i>this</i>. I mean...



Well, yeah, that's right, you're--
you're not gonna pay me anything.



- Doug.
- What?



Seriously.



I-- I'm serious. I really enjoyed doing it.



Good, I'm glad. But no way.
You're taking at least two hundred.



- No. No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.



I would have paid ten times more
anywhere else.



I don't wanna take advantage.



You're not taking advantage.



Look, if-- if you wanna
take me out to dinner,



we can call it even.



- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.



- Have you been waiting long?
- No, no.



My best friend that I grew up with
was already living here, so...



- Made it easier.
- Of course. Much easier.



Yeah. How about you?
Did you move here with friends, or...?



No. Actually it was work
that brought me down here.



My family and friends
are all still in Seattle.



Hmm.



It took a lot of courage
to do that, huh?



The truth is, I kind of wanted
to make a fresh start for myself.



I just got out of a serious relationship,
so



Oh.



Um...



...me too.



Really?



Yeah, it was right after college.
It was like...



Let's not go there.



I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- to--



No, no, it's fine.
Uh, I just wanted a sip, you know.



- It's just-- I was just trying to--
- It's totally fine.



It's funny, huh? I mean, scary.



- What?
- How much we have in common.



- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.



I know.



We're sitting in a restaurant
and the whole Mike thing came up, and...



What? Why would you bring that up?



- I didn't. He did.
- He brought up Mike?



He was talking about
why he moved here



and how he had just
got out of a relationship,



and I just said I did, too.



See, Ames,
there's so no reason to go there.



Can you help me find my fucking shoe?



The point is that he reached over
and he held my hand,



but it was all sweaty and <i>gross</i>.



- Fine. Then just blow him off.
- No, I don't want to hurt him.



It's just, things are good
with Matt right now.



Here's your shoe.



I'm just gonna slow it down.



Tell him I'm busy
whenever he wants to do something.



<i>...high of 84, winds northwest</i>
<i>at 5 to 10 miles per hour.</i>



<i>Tonight, generally clear skies</i>
<i>with a few...</i>



My fuckin' laptop was stolen
along with all my work stuff.



<i>You're kidding me! How?</i>



Well, I left it in the car,
I went to get a coffee,



and when I came out it was gone.



<i>Oh, my God. Ames.</i>



Twelve loan applications
with social security numbers,



- home addresses...
- <i>You didn't lock your car?</i>



I did. I <i>thought</i> I did.



So fucking stupid.



<i>Oh, shit, Ames, I wish I could</i>
<i>leave right now. I'm sorry I can't.</i>



God, it was so humiliating.



They had the security guard walk me out
in front of the whole company.



- Hey.
- Hey, how's it goin'?



Good. Come on in.



Come here, Rocky.



- Oh! Oh!
- Poor guy.



- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.



I'm fine.



Seriously, I'm okay.



- You sure?
- Yeah.



- You want a drink?
- Uh, yeah, sure.



You ever thought about
doing your art full-time?



Yeah, but, um,
I don't think I can.



Not yet, anyway.



Amy, trust me.
You can make a living at it.



You think so?



No.



Uh!



I mean it. I'm serious.



Mm-hm. You're bad.



I know.



I'm sorry...



I can't.



I'm so sorry. I just--



I can't right now.
It's just too fast.



That's okay.



My bad.



What did he say?



Nothing, but...



he was practically limping
out the door.



What, with his big blue balls
rollin' behind him?



Come on, let's go.



Cocktails await the cock tease.



I'm kidding.



Come <i>on</i>. let's go.
Don't make me kick you.



Ohh...



Ow.



Ohh...



Ay, fuck!



<i>No sé. Yo creo que fue algo</i>
<i>que me dio alergia.</i>



- Dios mío.
- <i>Es que me arde mucho la piel.</i>



Mija, quiero que vayas al doctor
ahora mismo.



<i>Espérame. Espérame.</i>



Fuck.



<i>I don't think you want to be seen</i>



in public with me right now.



<i>Shit.</i>
<i>We can't catch a break, huh?</i>



Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's been
one thing after another.



<i>Hey, don't worry about it.</i>
<i>It's not your fault.</i>



Maybe you want to come over
and we can watch a movie or something?



I promise I'll sit across the room.



<i>You know, I-- I think I'm gonna</i>
<i>catch up on some work tonight.</i>



<i>Yeah, you know, I've been</i>
<i>dragging my ass on it for too long,</i>



<i>got a shitload of stuff.</i>



Um, okay.



Maybe next week or something, huh?



<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.</i>



Okay.



<i>Yeah. Feel better.</i>



- Bye-bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>



<i>Ay!</i>



Fuck!



<i>¿Por qué me pasa a mí esto,</i>
<i>carajo?</i>



Oh, no.



Oh, my God.



Oh, my-- I'm sorry.



No, I'm sorry.



I think it's pretty much over.



Don't say that.



Can't blame him, really.



He must think
I'm a total pain in the ass.



God, Ames...



It's a friggin' patch of bad luck.



If he can't see that, then...
to hell with him. Seriously.



He's not worth it.



Have you heard from Doug at all?



I just hope he's not mad at me.



I'm sure he's fine.
Why would he be mad?



You should call him, you know?



Just to touch base.



- Hello.
- <i>Hi. Amy Ruis, please.</i>



Speaking.



<i>Amy, it's Todd Siegel calling</i>
<i>from Griffin Cafe in Brentwood.</i>



<i>I'm calling about your artwork.</i>
<i>Do you have a few moments?</i>



<i>Well, in short,</i>
<i>we're a five-star restaurant,</i>



<i>and for décor we display the work</i>
<i>of promising local artists.</i>



<i>What do you think about dropping by</i>
<i>this afternoon so we can talk?</i>



I think-- yeah. I mean, thank you.
This is great.



<i>No, no, thank</i> you<i>. And please</i>
<i>give our thanks to your friend again.</i>



Sorry?



Hi, Rocky.



I thought you said you had
a bag over your head.



Well, this is the best I could do.



Well, uh...



you don't look so bad.



Because you can't see it.



No, no, I'm serious.
Here, I got you something.



Oh, you're <i>good</i>.



No, honestly, total fluke.



I had a lunch meeting there today,



and I took a look at
the pieces they had on the wall,



and I thought of you.



Because the pieces were good,



but they weren't anywhere
as good as yours.



- Oh, stop it.
- So anyways,



I thought that there would be
no harm in asking what it would take



- to get your work up there.
- No, none at all.



And the manager said, "Just talent,"
so I pointed him to your web site



and here we are.



Unbelievable.



Listen, my friend Jen's coming over
tonight with some Thai food,



just a little celebration dinner.



You want to join us?



Oh. Uh, I'd love to,
but I have to take a rain check.



Oh.



I'm sorry, but I promised this girl Kathy
I'd meet her in Long Beach tonight.



Hmm. Who's Kathy?



Girlfriend?



Well, I mean,
I don't know about "girlfriend."



They just started seeing each other.



Really.



Yeah. Kind of a blow to the ego.



Why? What do you care?
You guys are just friends, right?



You are so busted.



Yeah, Jen, I'm burning with jealousy.



Admit it, you want a poke
from that big butt worm.



Fuck off.



Seriously, though,
I need your help tomorrow.



He's coming here for lunch
and I want you to be here.



Why?



Just to be safe.



I mean, it's great
that he's moved on,



I just don't want to
encourage him again.



It's just, he's got no confidence,
you know?



Ohh! Ohh!



Fuck!



Fuck.



Fuck. Fuck.



<i>Hey, it's Doug.</i>



<i>I'm sorry, did I call too late?</i>



Shit.



It's open.



Hey, it's me.



Oh, God, are you okay?



I think I'm gonna need
a few stitches.



Oh, geez, okay. Um...



Can you let Rocky outside?
I don't want him to get hurt.



Yeah. Yeah. Come on.



Okay. Um... okay. Wow.



Uh, well, let's get you a rag. Let's--



Let me just tie it.



- There. Okay?
- Uh-huh.



Let's get you to the hospital.
Can you stand?



Yeah.



- Oh, shit. No, no, no, no.
- Okay. Okay.



Here. Tell you what. Here.



I'm sorry about this.



It's okay. I'm stronger than I look.



I'll let him in.



The shelf in the kitchen fell
when I was out.



The one with all the glasses on it.



I stepped right into
a pile of broken glass.



I couldn't see anything.
The damn light was off.



He stayed with me
through the whole thing.



Even the stitches.
He's such a sweetheart.



Thank you so much.



I know I keep saying that, but...



Are you gonna be okay for tomorrow?
I mean, with Rocky...



Yeah. Jen's coming over
before work, so...



You've done enough. Seriously.



Uh--



At least somebody's
having a good night, huh?



Yeah.



Oh. Yeah.



So, are we still on for lunch tomorrow?



Yeah. Yeah.



Yeah, absolutely.



- Well, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.



- All right. See you tomorrow.
- See ya.



When I think about
everything he's done for me,



it just blows my mind.



No shit.



I'm starting to feel like
a second fiddle around here.



Well, you can tell him
who's the boss at lunch.



- Oh, crap.
- What?



I can't do it today.
I have this fucking meeting.



I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.



That's okay. No worries.



Well, I mean, do you want to
call him and reschedule?



No. I can handle it.



What?



Nothing.



He's got a girlfriend.



Yeah, we'll see how long that lasts.



Shit.



Be a good boy.



- Hey, come on in.
- Hi.



- Did you hear?
- No.



They sold my paintings!
All three of them!



You're kidding! Congratulations!
That is great!



- I know!
- When did this happen?



Today. And they want three more.



- So, do you know who bought them?
- No, they didn't say.



Well, not that it matters.



I don't think they tell you anyway,
do they?



I don't know. I mean, I guess not.
It's probably a privacy thing.



But whoever it was,
they got good taste, huh?



God, I am so happy for you. God.



Listen, get ready,



'cause I have a feeling that this is
probably gonna be your new job.



Imagine. What a dream, huh?



- Champagne, anyone?
- Hey!



- Hi! Don't get up. Don't get up.
- You made it.



Oh...



- I thought you had a meeting.
- Do you think I would miss this?



- No.
- Congratulations, sweetie.



- I got you a little something.
- Thank you. It's all him.



What'd you get her?



I'm just kidding. Hi, I'm Jen.



Hi, I'm Doug. It's nice to meet you.



Yeah. I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.



- No, not at all. Why--
- She's kidding, Doug.



Yeah, I'm just kidding, honey.



- Chill.
- Oh. Ha ha.



- Who wants to get wasted?
- I do.



- I do too!
- Uh, I'll have a glass.



I have been telling her for ages
to get out there and sell her work,



- but does she listen to <i>me</i>? No.
- Would you give it a rest?



I'm just saying, you know?



Well, don't listen to her.
I've done a few shows.



I'm not talking about
a few little shows.



I'm talking about really getting out there
and selling the shit out of yourself.



Well, some people aren't
natural assholes like you.



Do you want a little more champagne?



- No! Doug, help me!
- Oh, fuck!



Shit, dude, um, sorry.



- Here. Here.
- Thank you.



No, it'll-- it'll be fine.



- Jen.
- No, it's okay, really.



- It shouldn't stain.
- It's okay.



It's okay. It's all right.



Do you want some more champagne?



You're not from San Diego,
though, right?



- He's from Seattle. I told you.
- Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.



I forgot. What part?



Uh, Beacon Hill.



Oh, very cool.



I mean, I don't really know Seattle,
but my cousin Mark is from there.



You, um, you have family still there?



Uh, yeah, uh, well, my parents,



but my dad's recently retired



and so him and my mother
are, uh, traveling through Europe.



- Hmm. Where?
- Retired from what?



Uh, medicine. He's an eye doctor.



Very cool.



I'll see if my cousin Mark knows him.



I don't know, but...



You know, the last time I was there
he took me to



this really great fashion district
called Ridgewood.



- Have you ever been there?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.



- Do you mind if I use your restroom?
- No, not at all.



- Thank you.
- Go ahead.



There's no Ridgewood in Seattle.
I completely made that up.



- Don't say anything right now, okay?
- Why not?



Because I don't want to
put him on the spot like that.



We don't know what's going on.
I'm sure there's a good reason for it.



- You could just ask him.
- I will, but not with you here.



Fuck. Fuck.



Hello?



This is him.



What? No, I-- I faxed that to him
on Monday.



Okay, well, you're gonna have to
give me an extra twenty minutes



because I'm on the West Side.



Okay, yes. Yes. Tell him
he will have it by two o'clock.



Okay. Yes. Thank you, Beth.
Good-bye.



- You have to go?
- Yes, I'm so sorry.



- So soon?
- Yeah, there's a mix-up at work,



- so I gotta go now. Sorry.
- Thanks for coming.



It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.



- Thank you for everything.
- I'm so happy for you.



- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, likewise.



<i>I really liked her. I can see</i>
<i>why you guys are best friends.</i>



Yeah, she's great. I mean, um,
she really liked you too, you know?



<i>She likes to ask a lot of questions,</i>
<i>doesn't she?</i>



She doesn't mean anything by it,
I swear.



<i>No, no-- I'm sure she doesn't, but--</i>



<i>by the way, she mentioned something</i>
<i>about Seattle,</i>



<i>like a, uh, shopping district</i>
<i>or something...</i>



- Yeah.
- <i>I can't remember.</i>



<i>I think it was called Bridgewood</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>



Yeah, I think so.



<i>Anyways, um, I may have said</i>
<i>that I've heard of it,</i>



<i>and I-- I know that this is wrong,</i>
<i>but to be honest,</i>



<i>I-- I've never heard of it.</i>



<i>It's just that she was</i>
<i>asking so many questions</i>



<i>and I had to go to the bathroom,</i>
<i>and I didn't want to be rude, but--</i>



Don't worry about it.
Sometimes she's a real jerk, you know?



And you buy that?



Why wouldn't I?
You were totally grilling him.



Oh, God.



Just put this to bed, all right?



Seriously. It's so stupid.



Well, whatever.



You push me to go out with the guy
and give him a chance and--



Amy, I'm just saying, you know,
you're kind of fucked up right now



and you're not seeing clearly.



I mean, yeah, he's doing
all these nice--



What, Ames? Come on,
I'm just trying to watch your back.



You're trying to watch <i>your</i> back.



- You should just do whatever you want.
- I will.



- Okay, good.
- I'm not a fucking child, you know?



When did I ever say
you were a fucking child?



While you've been working, he's been saving my
ass every fucking day.



You know what? Forget it.
Forget it.



Just give him a fucking chance.
Please.



Seattle, please.



Mark Fowles on Baxter Drive.



Hey, hey, Mark, it's Jen.
What do you say, cuz?



Um, listen, can you call me
at home tonight?



I need you to track down this doctor
that used to work in Beacon Hill.



He's gone. Rocky's gone.
He's not on the patio.



- Was the gate open?
- I mean, <i>obviously</i>.



Fuck, Jen, did you check
outside the gate?



Yeah, <i>Amy</i>, he's not there.



He's probably next door
or down the street at the park.



All right, I'll go look.
Just stay there. Just stay there.



Rocky!



Rocky!



Come on, Rocky!



Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.



What are you doing here?



I just spoke with Amy. I thought
I'd come out here and help you look.



No luck so far, huh?



No, but I'll be fine, thanks, okay?



Hey, look, maybe we should
just split up, okay?



You don't like me very much,
do you?



I don't even know you.



I mean, I know you're not
from Seattle, but...



- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Just forget it.



Hey, how are you?



Oh. I can't talk right now.



What's wrong?



Amy, what--



Amy, what happened?
Talk to me.



What happened?



Jen's dead.



She fell down the stairs.
It was so dark.



What stairs?



At the park.



She was looking for Rocky,
and...



it was so wet and dark...



She must have slipped.



I couldn't go with her.



I couldn't go. I couldn't walk.



<i>I'm gonna stay at my parents</i>
<i>for a few more days.</i>



<i>Okay, I understand.</i>
<i>Come back when you feel ready.</i>



<i>Look, I want you to know that</i>
<i>I'm still looking for Rocky.</i>



<i>Thank you, Doug.</i>



Do you want some more?



I think I'm gonna go home now, okay?



How's Kathy?



Better, I'm sure, since this morning.



What do you mean?



She ended it.



Oh. I'm sorry.



It's for the best.



I haven't exactly been giving her
a lot of attention lately.



I know. I'm sorry.



No-- hey, no. Don't say that, all right?
It wasn't working out.



Hey. I mean that, Amy.
Okay?



Now, you're gonna call me
if you need anything, right?



I'll see you tomorrow.



You're the best friend I have.



- Look who's home.
- Oh, my God!



Oh, my God! Rocky!



Oh, my baby! Ooh, look at you!



Mmm...



So every night I've been
pretty much going around



the same sections of the neighborhood
callin' out his name, tryin' to find him.



And I'm sorta finishing my round,



and I figure that I should
check out that alley one last time.



So I go up to the alley
and I yell out Rocky's name,



- and then I hear this bark.
- Oh, my God.



So I run down the alley,
and there he is.



- That's-- that's it.
- Holy shit.



Okay, okay, hold on already.



- I'm just gonna get a water.
- Yeah, sure.



You're not running away
this time, boy.



Hey.



Is something the matter?



It's okay, Doug.



Fuck!



It's all right.



I shouldn't have done this.



- No, Doug.
- I can do it. I can do it.



- No.
- I can do it!



It's not that.



Please. Don't!



Get <i>off</i>!



I'm sorry.



I can't do this. It's just not right.



We made a big mistake.



- I'm sorry.
- How can you say that?



It's not a mistake.
How can you say that?



I don't want to hurt you.
I care about you a lot.



Why? What do you have
to go back to?



I know that you're alone,
and I-- I know that.



And I know that you're hurting.



We don't <i>have</i> to be alone. I--



- I think you should go home.
- No.



No, let's just-- let's just talk about this.



- I need you to leave.
- I have done <i>everything</i> for you.



When you-- when you lost your job,
when you hurt yourself,



when you had <i>nothing</i>,
I took care of you.



- I know you did.
- But you want to go back. To what?



Huh? To being alone?
To this empty room? To that brush?



Don't you get it?
I am here for you! I'm--



What the fuck are you talking about?



I love you!



You said "brush." My <i>brush</i>.



What the fuck did you mean by that?



How did you know that?



There's no way you could--



Oh, my God.



Fuck!



Fuck.



Let me out.



No, no, no, no, no.
I need to explain--



- Get out of my fucking way!
- I need to ex--



No! No! No! No!



Amy! Amy!



- Fuck!
- Let me in!



Amy!



Let me in!



Amy!



I don't want to--
I don't want to hurt you!



Just listen. I want you to listen.



I just wanted you to listen.



Please, Doug.
You have to let me out of here.



- I can't breathe.
- Shh. Just listen.



Just listen to me.



No...



When I saw you...



at that park, the first time...



you looked so much like--



--you looked so much like
someone I knew.



But-- but-- but different.



She was so cruel to me, Amy.



And I love her.
And-- and when she--



--when she didn't, I...



...I wanted to die.



I wanted to die. You see?



Oh, God.



But not anymore.
Not anymore.



Because of you.



When I first saw you
you looked exactly how I felt.



And I couldn't stop thinking about you.



And I wanted to talk to you,
but...



I just wanted you to give me a chance.



I just wanted you to look at me
and know that we are the same.



Look...



I'll take 'em down.



I'll take them all down,
Amy, I promise,



just please don't push me away.



I'm not gonna push you away, Doug.



I mean it.



- You really scared me, you know?
- I know. I know.



And I'm-- I'm so sorry.



I know you are.



And I know how hard it is.



When I moved here...



sometimes I felt like... I was dying,



like... I'd give anything
to not feel so alone.



I understand. I do.



I mean... I don't like what you did,
but...



but I understand.



In a way, I'm glad.



I feel like I'm really seeing you
for the first time.



Can you do something for me?



I want to know <i>you</i> more.



I want to know as much about you
as you know about me.



So come on.



I'm gonna get us some tea
and we're gonna talk, all right?



Hmm?



Come on.



Don't.



Hey, what's the matter, Doug?



We're just going to the kitchen.



I'm not gonna do anything.



We're just gonna talk, all right?



Let me out of here, all right?



Let me out!



<i>¡Te odio! ¡Púdrete en el infierno!</i>



Fucking cunt!



Ohh! Ohh!



Oh, my God.
