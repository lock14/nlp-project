00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:02,407
Tony Fingleton: In australia in the 1950s,












5
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:12,117
 

6
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:14,219
Water changed that.

7
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,289
It kept you alive and safe...

8
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,824
At least for a little while.

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,328
I was about to swim the whole length underwater!


10
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:25,230
Why'd you do that?

11
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,099
We have to go and meet dad.

12
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,034
John: We don't have to if we don't want to.


13
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,536
I'm the oldest, and I said we go!


14
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:40,345
That's me--tony Fingleton.

15
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,159
 

16
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,854
I was the next-oldest after harold, jr.


17
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:25,791
Then came john, ronald, and diane.


18
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,492
Hi, mr. O'brien!

19
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,095
Our world was the pool, the wharves,


20
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,930
Our mother and our father.

21
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:33,732
Look! There's dad! Come on!


22
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:38,904
Dad!

23
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,573
Dad! Dad!


24
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:44,609
I was always a little afraid of my father.


25
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,978
From my earliest memory

26
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,647
There was nothing I could do that pleased him.


27
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,349
I just never connected with him.


28
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,952
So I fell between the cracks.

29
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,354
Hey, dad!

30
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,923
Look at you mob of rat bags.


31
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,124
How are ya?

32
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,193
Hello, dad. Hi, sweetheart.


33
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,928
Hey, dad! Dad!

34
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,930
Dad! Dad!

35
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,631
Throw it to me, dad! Dad, come on!


36
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:08,734
Okay, give me some distance. Kick it to me!



37
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:10,936
Dad! Dad!

38
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,308
 

39
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,878
Harold, jr: How's that, dad?


40
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,848
How'd I do, dad?

41
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,282
You're good.

42
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,985
Am I as good as you?

43
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,921
Oh, you'll catch up.

44
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,256
Diane: I'm tired.

45
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,627
Oh! You all right? Yeah.


46
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,069
Billie: Dora? Oh, there you are.


47
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,571
I thought you were gonna stop by


48
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,140
And have a cuppa with me.


49
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:24,143
Oh, I am, I'm just finishing the last load.


50
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:27,112
Uh-uh. You've chosen a great day to do this job.


51
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,047
I'll hand-deliver it.

52
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:30,849
Aren't you hot in that dress?


53
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,585
Kids: Hi, billie! Hi.


54
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,990
I brought you round a little something.


55
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,491
Oh, it's lovely.

56
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,426
There was an overrun at the factory.


57
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:42,627
Oh, thank you.

58
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:44,329
Diane, look at this.

59
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,165
That'd make a nice dress for you, eh?


60
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,901
I don't suppose I could convince you


61
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,702
To make a frock for yourself.


62
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,004
  yes.


63
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:53,505
How about that cuppa?

64
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,841
Diane: No, billie, dad's coming.



65
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,443
Oh, well, I'm on my way.


66
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:01,313
Heaven forbid your mum should have a friend to talk to.



67
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,115
Billie.

68
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,717
The materials... You know.


69
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,052
Oh. It's okay.

70
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,122
Stop by and have that tea when you can sneak out.


71
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:11,990
Hi, billie. Hey.


72
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:14,026
Hi, billie. Hey there.


73
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,694
Tony: Where's the football?

74
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,765
See ya, harold.

75
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:25,037
 

76
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,906
Harold, jr: Hurry up. Come on!


77
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:40,018
Did you manage to see the grocer?


78
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,155
Because, uh, it was a bit unpleasant yesterday.


79
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,824
It's okay. I paid him every penny.


80
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,961
Oh...That's good.

81
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,764
There was nothing left over,


82
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:55,334
So I couldn't get you anything...Special.


83
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:58,871
Harold, jr: Get out of the way. You're short.



84
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,605
Diane: I'm gonna get a bucket!



85
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,479
What's going on? It's their anniversary.


86
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,149
 

87
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,820
 

88
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,259
What's got into you?

89
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,960
I know you didn't get me a present.


90
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,729
Why don't you sing me a song instead?


91
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,367
Do you remember the one I sang


92
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,402
On the night we first went out?


93
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,604
No, I don't.

94
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,439
Well, I was drunk.

95
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
Uh-huh.

96
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,876
¶ when irish eyes ¶

97
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,744
¶ are smiling ¶

98
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:43,248
¶ sure it's like a moon-- ¶ hello.



99
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,617
I'm not gonna make a mug of myself in front of the kids.



100
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,885
It wouldn't be for the first time.


101
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,921
Diane: What are you doing?


102
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,156
He's singin' me a song.

103
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,524
Well, go on, dad, sing it.


104
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,492
  want some water?


105
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:00,899
¶ in the lilt of irish laughter ¶


106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,970
¶ you can hear the angels sing ¶


107
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,604
 

108
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:12,777
¶ when irish hearts are happy ¶


109
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:17,349
¶ all the world seems bright and gay ¶


110
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,085
Come on, sweetheart.

111
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:24,522
¶ and when irish eyes are smiling ¶


112
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,959
You stood on my toes, you can sit down.


113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,161
¶ sure they steal ¶

114
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,330
¶ your heart ¶

115
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,198
¶ away ¶

116
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:35,267
That's good.

117
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,269
That's lovely.

118
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,637
That's all. I'm gonna have a cup of tea.



119
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,644
Harold: I just don't understand what you're on about!



120
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:49,181
Tony: Dad's moods could swing wildly.


121
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,984
And those moods dominated our lives.


122
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,885
Don't go around telling people we can't pay our bills!


123
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,820
Dora: I just thought we could use some extra money.


124
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,690
You want more money, you go paint the bloody house!



125
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:00,959
Peace didn't last long.

126
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,394
Nope.

127
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,697
  ron.


128
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:22,680
We've got the pool all to ourselves.


129
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,183
I'm gonna break the water.

130
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:28,520
[all shouting excitedly]


131
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,156
Come on, ronald, get out of the way!


132
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,790
Whoa-ho!

133
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:02,487
 

134
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,257
  dora: I love that.


135
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,791
I love the minute waltz.

136
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,930
Come on, you poofter.

137
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:13,498
I'm playing this for mum.

138
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,633
Oh, goody. Saint tony.


139
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,935
Ahh-ohh!

140
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,372
 

141
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,475
You do what I want, or else.


142
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:32,117
Tony: Dad.


143
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,785
Dad!

144
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,754
Dad.

145
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:40,892
Dad.

146
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,395
Harold slammed my fingers in the piano.


147
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,730
Then he punched me right in the stomach.


148
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,632
Did you punch him back?

149
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,701
Well, give him a smack in the mouth.


150
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,736
But I can't.

151
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,440
Right, come on.

152
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,875
 

153
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,078
All right, touch gloves.

154
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,880
Now, keep 'em up in front of your face.


155
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:05,484
That's good. Now circle round each other.


156
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,385
Now move in. Left to the head.

157
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,588
Another one.

158
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,589
Good.

159
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,623
Keep your gloves up.

160
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:13,024
What are you doing? Hit him.


161
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,295
What are you crying for?

162
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,297
Ha! You are. You're crying.


163
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:20,698
I'm not.

164
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:22,334
You are now.

165
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,603
Don't worry about it. Get in there.


166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,273
Oh, for christ's sake.

167
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,541
 

168
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,176
Get up!

169
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,777
I think he's better at football.


170
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,513
Mum! Come on, you little poofter,



171
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,114
Get up and fight! Don't be such a sissy.


172
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:38,049
I'm not a sissy. You are.


173
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,819
Come on, you little piano player. Huh? Saint tony?



174
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,656
Harold: Good duck. Yeah, into the kidneys!


175
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,491
Yeah! Good, harold. Ha ha ha ha!


176
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,626
Good! Good! That's it!


177
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,494
Give him a right. That's it!


178
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:53,298
Stop it! Harold, stop it, leave him alone!



179
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,767
Harold, leave him alone! Leave him alone!


180
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,669
Harold!

181
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,237
Are you mad?!

182
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,773
You want him to grow up to be a fairy? Oh, shut up, harold.



183
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,841
He's got to learn to defend himself.


184
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:06,110
You're always sticking up for him. Bastard.



185
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,013
You're far too overprotective. That's your trouble.



186
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:09,981
Get inside.

187
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,350
Come on.

188
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,053
Okay, drop me.

189
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,154
Duck.

190
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,158
  you're a champ.


191
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,561
If harold, jr. Felt like

192
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,829
The worst brother you could have,


193
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,532
John was the best.

194
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,368
Harold was a real bastard to do that to you.


195
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,237
And so was dad.

196
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:37,375
I wish I could be good at something. Anything.



197
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:40,378
At least better than harold at something. Maybe then.


198
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,181
Yeah, I'd like to see harold win book prize for best student.


199
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:46,050
Dad could care less about that, anyway.


200
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,240
I've made your breakfast, harold.


201
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,447
I've made your breakfast.

202
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,857
Is dad okay?

203
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:26,924
Hmm.

204
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:34,866
It's not your fault he's got no work, mum.


205
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,882
If you want to be alone, I've brought your breakfast in here.



206
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,050
You know what you can do with your breakfast.


207
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,119
That'd be a great waste of good food.


208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,054
Get out and leave me alone. No. No.


209
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,391
I've gone to the trouble to make your breakfast for you,


210
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,793
You may as well have it!

211
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,261
Christ!

212
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,397
 

213
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,165
Jesus christ!

214
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,166
Ohh!

215
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,534
You cow!

216
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,906
Come here!

217
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,609
Dora! Dad, leave her alone!


218
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,677
Dad!

219
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,146
Come back in here, you cow!


220
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,549
Get off me, you little bastards!


221
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,583
Get off!

222
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,385
Diane: Dad! Dad!


223
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,886
Dad!

224
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,121
Dad.

225
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,122
What?

226
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,157
You got egg in your hair.


227
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,393
Have I?

228
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:37,429
Yes.

229
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,030
A-ha ha!

230
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,268
 

231
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,672
Okay. All right.

232
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,274
You got me.

233
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,076
You look gorgeous.

234
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,044
I know.

235
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,781
There's three new boats in the wharves, harold.


236
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,951
Looks like there's plenty of work for next month or so.



237
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,520
Well, thank christ.

238
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,255
Morning, mrs. Gilroy.

239
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,927
Well, I might have a bath, maybe a bit of breakfast.


240
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,797
Eggs and beans'd be nice. Want some, tommy?


241
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,232
Yeah, all right.

242
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,569
But if it's all the same to you, could I have mine on a plate?


243
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:19,871
Hey!

244
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,681
Come on in the house.


245
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,884
The way to dad's heart was to be good at sports.


246
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:37,622
I was no better at football than I was at boxing.


247
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:40,892
Hey, score any points in the game?


248
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:43,160
For the other team, maybe.


249
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,342
Harold: Bloody hopeless.

250
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:00,478
He did his best, harold.

251
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,748
Too much piano, I'd say, dora.


252
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,318
 

253
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,090
Dad, come swimming with us.

254
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,126
You never come swimming with us.


255
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,695
No, you kids are all right by yourself.


256
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,964
I hate the smell of chlorine.

257
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:23,034
Go swim with them. Come on, dad.


258
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,002
You fancy yourself as esther williams now,


259
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,337
Do you? Harold.


260
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:40,518
Got it!

261
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,854
I didn't bring a coin. Give me yours.



262
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,121
No, why should I?

263
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,457
'cause I said so.

264
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,459
Get your own!

265
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,794
What are ya? Huh? You little poofter!


266
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,764
[harold, jr. And tony arguing]


267
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:58,903
Poofter.

268
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,038
I'm not a poofter. Don't call me that, all right?



269
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,894
Do you always swim as well as that?


270
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,328
As well as what?

271
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:25,730
That.

272
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh. Yeah, I guess.

273
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,434
It's good.

274
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,170
Oh, thanks. Well, we're here all day long.



275
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,072
We play around, you know.


276
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:38,309
Have you seen john? He's faster than me at free-style.



277
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,410
John.

278
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,747
Swim over here.

279
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,724
Harold: Get out.

280
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:56,160
Line up on the blocks.

281
00:16:56,161 --> 00:17:00,097
Swim to the other end when is say"go."


282
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,766
I'm not swimmin' anywhere.

283
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,735
Who asked you?

284
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:06,871
Get on your marks...

285
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,439
Get set...

286
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,741
Go!

287
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,229
That's not too bad.

288
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,566
You should watch tony do the backstroke, dad.


289
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,668
Okay, show me.

290
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,636
You go with him, free-style.


291
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,383
Bloody hell.

292
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:55,053
I want both of you back here at five.


293
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,254
We're gonna do some training.


294
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:59,156
But I've got a piano lesson.


295
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,593
Not anymore, you don't. That's enough poofter stuff.


296
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,327
We're doing something serious.


297
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,573
All right, come on. Wake up.


298
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,174
Rise and shine. What time is it?


299
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,376
Twenty to 6:00. Time to get up.

300
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:22,313
The pool opens at 6:00, we're gonna be there to open it.



301
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,183
Ohh!

302
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,661
Good. Three seconds off yesterday.



303
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:40,564
Backstroke's definitely your stroke.


304
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,367
And nobody's gonna take that away from you.


305
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,910
Man: On your blocks!


306
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,148
Now we'll see what he's made of.


307
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,683
You watch john.

308
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:04,088
Take your marks...

309
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,456
 

310
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,439
A good turn.

311
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,275
He's good, isn't he?

312
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:29,981
Come on, boy.

313
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,349
Yes. He's gonna do it, dad.


314
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,152
Come on, boy!

315
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,287
Come on!

316
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,322
Come on! Go, john!


317
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:39,256
Come on!

318
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,193
Go, john!

319
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:50,501
We've done it! We've done it!


320
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:52,503
You little beauty!

321
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:54,405
You bloody little ripper!

322
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,207
Harold, that's enough.

323
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,142
What? Everybody's lookin' at you.


324
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,544
John! Good on ya, boy!

325
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:04,048
Harold. You bloody little ripper!


326
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,183
Sit down.

327
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:07,218
Oh, for christ's sake.

328
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,754
You made a fool of yourself.


329
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:11,522
 

330
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,562
Here. Come on, come on.

331
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,364
Photographer: That's it, son.


332
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,833
What's it say?

333
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,369
I hope I can win too, mum.

334
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:29,941
 

335
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,475
Hey!

336
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,678
Well done.

337
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,619
Come on, tony!

338
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,960
Oh, he won! Just.


339
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,662
It was clear that dad lived through john's early success.


340
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,197
I may have won my race,

341
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:56,234
But it was john's picture that went up on the wall.


342
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,902
Is that straight?

343
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:00,171
Do you think it's big enough?


344
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,339
I feel like I ought to be lighting candles


345
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,142
In front of it or something.

346
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,116
Oh.

347
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:17,255
[mass being said in latin]


348
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,796
I'm sorry we're late. The tram got stuck.


349
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,231
That's all right, but, uh...

350
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:28,666
Shh.

351
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,811
 

352
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,250
You wanted to talk to me?


353
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,386
About my boys, brother.


354
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,790
I know who they are.


355
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,295
I want them to come to your school.


356
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,363
It's the best school in brisbane.


357
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:00,798
I see.

358
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,234
But I can't afford to send 'em here.


359
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,703
In nomeni patris et filii


360
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,972
Spiritus sancti.

361
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:16,714
Do you want to win the interschool swimming championships this year?



362
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:20,651
And the year after that?

363
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,654
Take my boys.

364
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,289
John's the best swimmer his age in australia.


365
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,894
I know. Tony's the state champion.


366
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:36,300
Et cum spiritu tuo.

367
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,575
Oh, harold,

368
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:48,379
Father dillon is hearing confession right after mass.



369
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,547
Is he? That's nice.


370
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:52,583
Probably been a while?


371
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,253
I'll pop along... Next week.


372
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,454
Since you're here--

373
00:22:57,455 --> 00:23:00,657
And since your boys will be coming here...


374
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:03,527
With no tuition fees, though?

375
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,329
No fees.

376
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,433
Pax vobiscum.

377
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,208
Father dillon is right this way.


378
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:20,211
Hot in here, isn't it?


379
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:22,213
Not for us protestants.

380
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:30,187
Hope father dillon's got plenty of time.


381
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,361
Come on. Come on.


382
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,996
Faster!

383
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:41,598
Faster!

384
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,205
How'd we do, dad?

385
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:49,974
Well, don't stop. Go back.


386
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,377
We kept training...

387
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,645
And winning.

388
00:23:56,748 --> 00:23:59,550
And training...

389
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:00,818
And winning.

390
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:28,179
Not a lot changed over the next five years.


391
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,815
We trained, we swam,


392
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:32,916
We won.

393
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,154
Okay. Hop out.

394
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,190
That's all you need to do today.


395
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,960
I want you to stay sharp.


396
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,295
Feels good, dad.

397
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,796
That's 'cause you're number one, john.


398
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:49,033
You're the one that's gonna kill 'em all.



399
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,134
Come on.

400
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,041
 

401
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:01,012
Dad and the other workers were always after a fairer deal.


402
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:04,315
Strikes were common and often ugly.


403
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,584
And the police always seemed to be on the boss's side.


404
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:18,129
 

405
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,100
Man: You bloodsuckers!

406
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:27,804
I thought it was you.

407
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,408
Surely you remember.

408
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,743
You got the wrong bloke, mate.

409
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,745
No. Right bloke, son.

410
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,983
I even remember how much I paid ya.


411
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:42,453
You and your mother.

412
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,947
 

413
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,282
 

414
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,053
Dora.

415
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,424
Everybody stay.

416
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,126
Harold, wait.

417
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,969
I...

418
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,204
Oh, my god.

419
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,275
Tony: It's dad.

420
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:14,878
What's wrong?

421
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,248
There's nothing wrong with him. He's drunk.


422
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:18,682
Dad?

423
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:21,118
John, take ron and diane to bed, will you?



424
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,786
What happened? Get out of here.


425
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,221
Just get away.

426
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:28,626
I'm all right.

427
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,362
Here. Put these in the fridge.


428
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,765
Oh, dad! Careful.


429
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,334
It's all right. That's a boy.


430
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:44,175
Don't worry about it. I'll clean it up.


431
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,417
Shouldn't we put him to bed?


432
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,223
What are you looking for?


433
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,626
I've got it.

434
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:15,038
Hey...Come on.

435
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,341
Dad, you've had enough.

436
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,775
No, I...

437
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:39,996
When I was your age...

438
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:41,998
I was tougher.

439
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:52,909
What are you talking about?


440
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,312
Harold: You're far too weak.


441
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:03,019
You make me feel ashamed.


442
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,990
I wish you didn't exist.


443
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,965
Oh, tony. Come to bed.


444
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,769
They were a bunch of animals.


445
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,370
Bastards.

446
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,611
Harold, what happened?

447
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,513
What happened today, huh?

448
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:06,617
What happened? How'd you get that mark on your face?



449
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:10,354
Coppers came out and, um...


450
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,289
Uh...

451
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,627
I think I fell over.

452
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:18,862
Coppers...

453
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:20,230
Was it..?

454
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,533
It was all so long ago.


455
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:25,569
T-they were animals.

456
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,474
And my mother...

457
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,310
My mother, she was there.


458
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,313
They were animals!

459
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,149
What?

460
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:45,121
You're a very good woman, dora.


461
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:49,626
Where's tony?

462
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,395
 

463
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,029
You need to--

464
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,274
It's pretty bad this drinking of dads, isn't it, mum?



465
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:45,982
Well, he used to drink...

466
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:48,151
Before you kids were born.


467
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,657
Why did he say that to me last night?


468
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,395
 

469
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,967
I don't know.

470
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:08,572
I think he was just trying to lash out at somebody.



471
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:11,475
You know, anyone.

472
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:13,243
It's usually me.

473
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:15,946
You just happened to be there.


474
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,983
He doesn't care about me, does he?


475
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:21,785
Oh, darling, don't think that.


476
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:24,988
It was the drink talking.


477
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:32,463
He's a very difficult man.

478
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:33,931
He is.

479
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,333
W-what he said, it--

480
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,569
It didn't have anything to do with--


481
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,738
No, no. Forget what he said.

482
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,674
He's damaged.

483
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,376
His mother was a terrible drunk.


484
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:54,785
She used to bring men back to their room


485
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,120
At the hotel

486
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:59,523
For money, you know?

487
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,726
And he was in there.

488
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:07,063
I don't know what went on, but, um...


489
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:13,136
Well, I think he had to do some pretty...


490
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:17,608
Awful things to survive, you know?


491
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,180
Hates himself for it.

492
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,953
Anyway...

493
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,493
Are you as strong as I think you are?


494
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:41,164
I'm no good at football and boxing--


495
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:42,566
No, I don't mean that.

496
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,368
I mean up here...

497
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,970
In the head.

498
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:51,975
You've got to be so strong up there.


499
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,881
He doesn't matter.

500
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,484
You matter.

501
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,000
Even dad wouldn't say something like that.


502
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,103
Well, he did.

503
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:26,677
All I know is he'd never say anything like that to you or harold.



504
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:31,247
I guess you've just got to forget it.


505
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:38,589
Would you be able to forget it?


506
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,364
You know I'd never do anything to hurt you.


507
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,469
Ever.

508
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,737
I know.

509
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,389
Hubby still on strike?

510
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,958
Oh, hello. Yes.

511
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,593
We think it'll be over soon.


512
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,929
You know I can't give you anymore credit?


513
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:23,066
The boss'll come down on me if I do.



514
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,670
If it were up to me...

515
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:29,006
Yes. Put them back.

516
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,941
Put them back now.

517
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,811
Sorry. I'll just put these apples back.


518
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,388
Don't go in, mum. Nothing good'll come of it.



519
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:47,524
We'll see about that, won't we?


520
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,032
 

521
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:59,335
Hey, what're you doin' here?

522
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:09,846
Men's-only bar, missus.

523
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,482
Would you step aside, please?


524
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:18,689
If I have to go and get the police to come in here, I will.



525
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,259
Judging by the look of you, I'm sure they'd want to have a word with you anyway.



526
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:29,099
 

527
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:36,940
Would you come home now?

528
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:39,342
Oh, look, your kid's picture is in the paper,


529
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:42,478
And that's all it means to you, a place to put a glass of beer?


530
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,980
Dora, go home.

531
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:45,749
Not until you come with me.

532
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,383
Man: Leave your old man alone, missus,


533
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:49,052
He deserves to have his fun.


534
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,821
What about my fun, eh?

535
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:54,858
You should all be home with your wives and your children.



536
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,628
Your wives would love to have some of what you've spent here today.



537
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:02,833
Imagine, she might even get herself a decent pair of shoes!



538
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,836
You're makin' a fool out of me.


539
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,838
Go home. I'll be there in a minute.


540
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,905
Go on!

541
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:21,218
You should all be ashamed of yourselves, the lot of you!


542
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:23,787
 

543
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:30,093
You know, sometimes I don't mine when dad's drinking.



544
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,629
Why would you say that?

545
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,697
It's awful when he's drinking.


546
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:37,467
I know. I meant when we're training ourselves,


547
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,636
We don't have to work so hard.


548
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:41,571
I get tired of all this.


549
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:44,975
Well, you've got the australian championships in two weeks.



550
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,877
  you better--


551
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:49,412
Harold: Pick up the pace.

552
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:51,547
I don't want anymore bludging round here.



553
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,519
On your blocks.

554
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,964
Want an apple? Yeah, thanks.


555
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:14,938
 

556
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,372
G'day, mate.

557
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,409
Hey, how are ya?

558
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,845
To swim for australia and have to beat


559
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,379
The best of the best.

560
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,148
I can't believe I'm actually here.


561
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:27,583
John was just too young to compete.


562
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:31,321
Oh, there's tony.

563
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:32,689
You're from queensland, right?

564
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,690
Yeah.

565
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:35,292
Backstroke. Fingleton?

566
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:36,693
Yeah, that's right. You gonna win?


567
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:38,361
Well, I hope so.

568
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,197
Here. Here, tony.

569
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,033
Thanks.

570
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,741
Oh, there she is. Dawn fraser.


571
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,579
She's going to be the best of them all, isn't she?



572
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,258
Yes!

573
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:27,244
Come on!

574
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,215
I think he's gonna do it!


575
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:34,985
Go, tony!

576
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:38,421
Go, tony!

577
00:39:38,422 --> 00:39:39,655
Yes! He won!


578
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:45,428
Your son's just won the junior championship.


579
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,665
Wait'll these mugs see what you can do.


580
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:59,009
Thanks, rod. Thank you.


581
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:09,185
Congratulations, tony.

582
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:10,186
Thanks, dawn.

583
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:12,022
This is my brother, john.

584
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:14,291
Nice to meet you.

585
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:17,593
Well, congratulations.

586
00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:21,531
Dawn, I'm tony's trainer, harold Fingleton.


587
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,300
Pleasure.

588
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,969
So, do you think you're going to get a couple of gold for us



589
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,503
At the olympics in melbourne?


590
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,704
One would be nice.

591
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:31,141
John's gonna be there in four year's time.


592
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,409
I think he's got it in him.


593
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,411
Well, tony's not so bad, either.


594
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:37,280
He has to watch his times.


595
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,082
Here's my mother.

596
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,784
She wants me to get all the autographs I can.


597
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:43,420
Sign one for me? Me?


598
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,288
Yeah. You're a champ.

599
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,490
All right.

600
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:49,592
We've got to have our picture taken, too, so...



601
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:51,094
Great. We'll all come. John.


602
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,595
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

603
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:54,965
I think it's just the australian champs.


604
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:56,032
Sorry, mate.

605
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:03,006
 

606
00:41:12,783 --> 00:41:14,084
Where's john?

607
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:18,121
I'm here.

608
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:20,023
I've been down at the pool.

609
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,125
You're not there again.

610
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,194
I know. I took the day off.


611
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,229
Who said you could do that?

612
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,598
I did.

613
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,601
State championships are no joke.


614
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:34,137
Those kids are going to skin you alive.


615
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,606
Dad, not one of them has ever beaten me.


616
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,209
Kid from bundaberg's pretty good. No, I can handle him.



617
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,245
Dad, I'm just pacing myself, all right?


618
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:44,147
I can still win it.

619
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,988
 

620
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:08,204
Fifth.

621
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:40,770
You dirty, little cur.

622
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:46,242
I'm sorry dad. They were too good.


623
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,778
They weren't too good. They trained. You didn't.



624
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:51,614
I don't think you've got the guts to workout enough.



625
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:55,051
You think you're lord muck. You just have to show up to win.


626
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:58,354
You find somebody else to train you.


627
00:42:58,355 --> 00:43:00,790
Because you and me are through!


628
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:03,893
 

629
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:13,336
 

630
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:33,656
¶ when irish eyes...¶

631
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:38,894
¶...All the world ¶

632
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,736
¶...Eyes are smiling ¶

633
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:48,338
Surely you remember...

634
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:50,640
Harold: You got the wrong bloke, mate.


635
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:54,244
No. Right bloke, son.

636
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:55,645
Remember?

637
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,815
It's just like the old days, ain't it?


638
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:14,197
Harold: Brains of a complete idiot!


639
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:15,931
No, I don't.

640
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:18,234
You talk a whole lot of drivel!


641
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,936
 

642
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:22,472
Oh, that's it. Go on.


643
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:24,707
 


644
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,909
...Bunch of no-hopers.

645
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,045
Who are you calli" a no-hoper?


646
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,214
You're the biggest no-hoper of the lot.


647
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,716
What have you ever done that was so great?


648
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:35,718
Bringin' you in the world for starters


649
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,655
Wasn't so great, you useless little bludger.


650
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:42,292
Oh, yeah? Well, all we ever hear about


651
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,528
Is how bloody great you were at football.


652
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:47,664
What do you got to prove it?


653
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,099
You're nothin'. That's what you are. You're nothin'.



654
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,502
I want you to go to bed. No, I'm not going to go to bed.



655
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,036
What would you know, huh?

656
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:56,239
Who do you think you are? You sit in your little chair,


657
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,708
And all you do is judge people!


658
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:08,150
Leave him alone!

659
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:14,657
Harold: You animal!

660
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,767
Get off him!

661
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:29,339
Oh, my finger!

662
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,474
Oh, you've got my finger!


663
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,344
You've hurt mum!

664
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:35,678
Get a cloth!

665
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,180
Somebody get my purse. You gotta go to the hospital!


666
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:40,650
Stay there!

667
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:54,230
Mum!

668
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,968
Diane: Mum, are you all right?


669
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah, she's fine. Thanks for asking.


670
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:09,011
She's got 15 stitches, and lucky to have the bloody finger at all!



671
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,700
What are you reading?

672
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:32,968
It's hamlet.

673
00:46:40,944 --> 00:46:43,646
Do you wanna win this championship next month or not?


674
00:46:45,248 --> 00:46:48,017
You can both do an extra mile for the next three weeks


675
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:49,619
To make up for all your bludging.


676
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,021
Those kids who beat you last year


677
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:55,858
Are gonna be as keen as mustard to do it again this year.


678
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:00,029
Beat you to the other end. No way!


679
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,043
Okay. Come back.

680
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:15,378
Flat out.

681
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:17,213
Back stroke. Both of you.


682
00:47:34,898 --> 00:47:37,367
I think you should go down and train by yourself



683
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,569
At the valley baths right up to the race.


684
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,904
It'll give you a week to get used to the feel


685
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:43,773
Of the length of the pool.

686
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:45,541
Yeah, all right. What about john?


687
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,744
I'll keep him at spring hill.


688
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:50,312
I think he needs to work on his turns.


689
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:51,447
All right.

690
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,549
Okay, guys. Let's get cracking.


691
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:19,709
How's the training been? It's strange not seeing how you're doing.



692
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,411
It's going good. Yeah?


693
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,546
Are you gonna win today or what?


694
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:24,947
I hope so. We'll see.


695
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:26,181
I'll see you, later.

696
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:28,017
All right. See ya.


697
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,421
Has anyone seen john?

698
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:32,688
No, man.

699
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:38,428
 

700
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,367
Tony.

701
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:04,720
You lose something, tony?

702
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,622
Uh, yeah. I'm just looking for john.


703
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:09,692
We do this funny handshake. Don't worry, it doesn't matter.


704
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,340
Mum, what's going on?

705
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,508
I don't know.

706
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:03,045
Is he in the program?

707
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,514
No, I've looked.

708
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:40,149
He did it!

709
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,984
He's the one. I knew it.

710
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,059
Just a small change in plan.


711
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:05,742
Swimmer: Hey!

712
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:13,116
Swimmers: Oh!

713
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:50,619
Do you reckon could swim from here to america?


714
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:55,958
Are you just going to sit here feeling sorry for yourself?


715
00:51:58,028 --> 00:51:59,862
No. John's the star.

716
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:02,799
He's a... Better swimmer than me.


717
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,400
He always was.

718
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,869
He's good, mum.

719
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:10,773
John's number one.

720
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,916
You know, it's just one race.

721
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:22,351
There's gonna be plenty of races for you.


722
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:24,687
Mum, it's too late, all right?


723
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:28,057
How many years have I been swimming?


724
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:35,531
I wanted to win a medal. I wanted to be a champion


725
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:38,167
And win a medal at the olympics.


726
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:41,704
You know?

727
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,709
You know, I wanted to be somebody.


728
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:51,413
You think you're nobody, hmm?

729
00:52:51,414 --> 00:52:54,350
Winning a medal isn't going to change that--


730
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,285
Mum, it's not about that!


731
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:57,720
All right? I've wanted...


732
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:04,060
I had this plan, all right? I thought that maybe


733
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:06,729
If I could get to the top of the swimming


734
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,032
It would lead to something, and then I could get--


735
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:12,701
I could--I could just go!

736
00:53:12,702 --> 00:53:14,436
 

737
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:28,751
You've got to be very strong up here in the head, okay?


738
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:30,486
Listen...

739
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,524
Oh, my darling boy...

740
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:37,426
I love you. I love you.


741
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:39,828
I'm so proud of you.

742
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,533
Me, too.

743
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:46,468
Oh, my darling boy.

744
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,508
Only you can make something of yourself.


745
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:54,877
Not your father and not me.


746
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:57,880
And if swimming is what you're after,


747
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:00,616
Then there's always next year.


748
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:03,419
But, you know, there might be something


749
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,754
Completely different for you.


750
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:07,656
Nothing to do with swimming.


751
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:09,625
That'll, you know...

752
00:54:12,695 --> 00:54:15,064
Get you out of here.

753
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:16,632
If that's what you want.

754
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:50,366
Faster...

755
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,368
Harder.

756
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:04,213
Tony, come in for a beer.

757
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:06,282
No. No, I don't...

758
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:09,118
I've got to get...

759
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,123
So, are you training up?


760
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,125
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:18,461
Better you than me, mate.

762
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:19,795
I suppose.

763
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:27,069
You know, you've made my life bloody misery at times when we were kids.



764
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,372
You reckon?

765
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,341
Yeah, I do reckon.

766
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:36,712
'cause you used to piss me off.

767
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,215
Did I?

768
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,850
Yeah, you did. You were such a bloody saint.


769
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:43,085
So goody-good.

770
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,587
I wasn't goody-goody. I was just me.


771
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:49,492
At least I didn't duke it out on everyone the way you you did.



772
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:52,661
What do you expect? I had to take care of myself, didn't I?



773
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:55,464





774
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,400
Not after all that swimming stuff.


775
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,572
Is that why you tried to out-drink him?


776
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:08,577
Think you're pretty bloody smart, don't ya?


777
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:12,981
Eh?

778
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:14,417
 

779
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:22,858
Even though I knew I could beat the bejeezus out of you as a kid,



780
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:25,394
You were always a fighter.

781
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,196
You never give up, do ya?

782
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:29,165
I don't know.

783
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:33,302
Maybe one of these days I'll stop banging my head against the wall.



784
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:36,972
You know, being a fighter isn't about slugging it out in the ring.



785
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,277
You know that?

786
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:44,880
You should do this on your own, tony.


787
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,615
Show dad what you're made of.


788
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:54,957
You goin'? Yeah.


789
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,225
Okay.

790
00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:57,460
All right.

791
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:59,361
Yeah. Go get 'em.

792
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:01,730
Okay?

793
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,545
I'm sure I'll be at the championships next month.


794
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,981
They're going to be tough, but I can handle myself.


795
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:20,082
Always have.

796
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,118
Tony, it's a day of the big grudge match


797
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:23,619
Between you two brothers.

798
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,554
How about a few words before the race?


799
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:28,324
How 'bout a few words after the race?


800
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:30,058
Thanks, mate.

801
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:46,142
 

802
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:52,981
I don't know that I can stand this competition between the two of them.



803
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:55,017
I think I'm going to be sick.


804
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:57,786
Man: Take your marks!

805
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:59,421
 

806
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:15,904
John's falling back.

807
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:18,140
What? John's falling back.


808
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,587
Mum, tony's got the lead!

809
00:58:46,503 --> 00:58:48,370
Good on you, tony.

810
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,506
You beat me.

811
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:55,811
Didn't beat you... Beat him.


812
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,983
He's finished.

813
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:13,095
 

814
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:24,240
Dad...

815
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:26,609
Well...

816
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,477
You just threw it all away.

817
00:59:28,478 --> 00:59:30,512
I didn't throw it away!

818
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:34,550
Maybe I didn't want it.

819
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,051
Tony wanted it.

820
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:38,854
You threw it all away like a mongrel dog.


821
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:40,922
And you could've been the best in the country.


822
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:43,392
Well, now maybe tony is.

823
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:46,128
You know, he could win the australian championships next month.



824
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,730
That's his dream!

825
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:51,533
It's not my dream!

826
00:59:58,241 --> 00:59:59,808
Go home to your mother.

827
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:12,354
 

828
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:25,000
Harold: You wanted five kids.


829
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:30,439
Dora: What-- what have they done? What have we done--



830
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,474
What have they done?

831
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:38,814
Why was I in an orphanage? I had parents.


832
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:42,217
Why would they put me in there with those sick animals.


833
01:00:42,218 --> 01:00:45,053
 

834
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:48,023
I tell ya, I should've played...


835
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:50,526
I should've played football, but, oh, no.


836
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:53,028
No, no, not for harold Fingleton.


837
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:57,199
Dora wanted to have five kids.


838
01:01:00,169 --> 01:01:02,371
Jesus christ! You've had enough!


839
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,807
Give me that! I want you to stop drinking now!



840
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,508
What do you want?

841
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:08,176
Stop it!

842
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:11,079
Don't be an idiot. Let it go. Let it go!


843
01:01:13,149 --> 01:01:15,384
Are you okay?

844
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:19,287
 

845
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:22,825
Can't stand this anymore.

846
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,864
You can do whatever you like.

847
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:31,600
 

848
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:38,440
Dora.

849
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:39,908
Dora.

850
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:41,276
John?

851
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:43,178
John?

852
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,279
What?

853
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:47,249
What?

854
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,285
Harold: Dora?

855
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:51,820
What's he saying? Shh shh.


856
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:54,590
Wake up!

857
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:58,594
Stupid woman.

858
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:03,298
Where's mum?

859
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:10,606
Mum?

860
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:14,676
Mum, wake up.

861
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:16,011
Mum?

862
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:20,449
Mum? Wake up! What have you done?


863
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,517
Sleeping pills.

864
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,018
We've got to get her up!

865
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:24,753
Help me get her up! Roll her over.


866
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:28,424
Help me get her up! We've got to make her get up!


867
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:31,427
We've got to make her walk. She won't wake up.


868
01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:33,929
Use your feet, mum. Diane: Mum!


869
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,464
No, you can't lie down.

870
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:37,599
Tony, do you know what you're doing?


871
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,301
Diane, go and get a blanket.


872
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:45,441
Do we make her-- how do we make her throw up?


873
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:48,109
Mum! Mum, wake up!


874
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,478
Wake up! Get up!


875
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:50,746
Roll over.

876
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,414
 

877
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,349
We've got to call an ambulance.


878
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:56,418
Don't let her rest no matter what happens, all right?



879
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:58,386
Throw water on her! Just don't let her sleep!


880
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,459
We've pumped everything we could out of her stomach.



881
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,293
Now, her throat will be sore,


882
01:03:05,294 --> 01:03:06,628
But she'll be fine.

883
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:08,931
She can sleep if she wants to?


884
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:10,866
All right. Thank you.


885
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:16,972
I don't know what we'd all do without you, mum.



886
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:20,008
Please just let me know if you feel like that,


887
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,977
All right?

888
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:23,244
I will, darling.

889
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:28,750
I had to do something.

890
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,652
Not that.

891
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:33,589
Anything but that.

892
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:40,896
Well, I've tried everything else.


893
01:03:45,468 --> 01:03:47,569
Not everything else.

894
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:56,011
I know what you're driving at.


895
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,782
I will leave him, if, uh...


896
01:04:02,685 --> 01:04:04,820
If he doesn't stop.

897
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:09,925
Well, let's not talk about it.


898
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:12,494
I'll wait till you kids are all grown up and don't need me.



899
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:14,029
Which will be never.

900
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,964
 

901
01:04:18,467 --> 01:04:19,801
Darling, boy.

902
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:24,472
Sorry.

903
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,379
I'm sorry.

904
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,315
Mitchell... Which one's he?


905
01:04:41,323 --> 01:04:43,725
 

906
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:46,094
 

907
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,266
Come on, tony! Come on, come on!


908
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:58,440
So, who's plannin' on comin' in second to me?


909
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:01,810
You'll have to do a lot better than that with me, mate.



910
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:03,311
I've been psyched out by experts.


911
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,084
Take your marks!

912
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:10,285
 

913
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:20,629
Come on, tony!

914
01:05:35,812 --> 01:05:37,613
Come on, tony!

915
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:42,350
That's it, tony! Come on!


916
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:43,284
He's gonna win!

917
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:54,830
He won.

918
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,131
Well done!

919
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:01,503
Yes!

920
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,941
 

921
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:13,414
We've got an australian champion in the family.



922
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:19,154
Good on ya, kid.

923
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:24,325
That's it? Good on ya, kid?


924
01:06:24,326 --> 01:06:26,227
What do you want me to say?

925
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,634
You've been... Pushing these kids...


926
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:35,771
For years to do what tony just did.


927
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,707
You couldn't even be bothered

928
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:41,376
Going to see the biggest race of his life.



929
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,011
I'm finished with all that.

930
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:45,580
What's he ever done to you?

931
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:53,188
 

932
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,495
 

933
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,839
You all right, dad?

934
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,708
No.

935
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:14,743
 

936
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,513
I'm fine.

937
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,022
Is there anything I can do for you?


938
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:29,257
No.

939
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:36,765
Tony?

940
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,541
Listen...

941
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,879
You... You...


942
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,615
Go to bed.

943
01:08:15,704 --> 01:08:18,039
Dad...

944
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:21,743
Dad, I want you to see this.

945
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:28,549
I'm the best

946
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:31,119
In australia at something.


947
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,723
Maybe one of the best backstroke swimmers in the world.



948
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:41,729
You were the best in australia, were ya?


949
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:43,965
Yeah.

950
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:45,901
Oh...

951
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:52,908
Look, I'm sorry

952
01:08:52,909 --> 01:08:55,877
You had such a tough life as a kid.


953
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:59,447
And I'm sorry about the depression,


954
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:01,582
And how you didn't play football for australia,


955
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:04,019
But--but, dad, this...

956
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:07,355
This is my life...

957
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:16,231
And you... You're a part of it, dad.


958
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,305
It's for you.

959
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:25,640
I know you wanted it to be john,


960
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:27,775
But it's me who's done it.

961
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:32,513
It's me.

962
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:38,220
That's nothing to do with me.

963
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:43,691
I won the australian championship.


964
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,617
 

965
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,491
It's good, isn't it, dad?


966
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:21,329
It's good, isn't it, dad?


967
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,867
 

968
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:34,242
 

969
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,255
Feels good, dad.

970
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:54,729
 

971
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:03,305
What's this you're watching?


972
01:11:03,306 --> 01:11:05,173
Oh, is that president kennedy?

973
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:06,908
Yeah.

974
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:08,609
Isn't he lovely?

975
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,745
He's at some function at the harvard.


976
01:11:10,746 --> 01:11:12,580
That's were he went to university.


977
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:14,749
Looks like a nice place.

978
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:23,124
So far from brisbane. It might as well be on the moon.



979
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,894
 

980
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:32,667
Reporter: In the small town of ayr in northern queensland,


981
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,103
The australian swimming team is hard at training


982
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:37,472
For the upcoming empire games trials in melbourne,



983
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,307
Which will determine the team selection


984
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:41,309
For the games in perth.

985
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,512
And we all say, "good luck to you boys!"


986
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:45,913
 

987
01:11:45,914 --> 01:11:48,749
There's tony. Hi, tony. He's so lucky being--



988
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,053
Luck's got nothing to do with it you know that very well.



989
01:11:52,054 --> 01:11:53,955
Oh, there's murray rose.

990
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:56,057
Oh, he's so...

991
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:58,659
So... So blonde.


992
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:01,662
Tony looks well.

993
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,035
I wish I were on that team.


994
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,569
Don't you bother about that.


995
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:09,704
Dinnertime.

996
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:10,972
Diane, come on.

997
01:12:16,745 --> 01:12:19,314
Dad, I reckon I can take him on.


998
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:21,449
You wanna take another crack?


999
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,617
Why not?

1000
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:25,686
It's the big time, son.

1001
01:12:25,687 --> 01:12:28,956
Empire games outside the olympics is as big as it gets.



1002
01:12:28,957 --> 01:12:30,125
I wanna do it.

1003
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:31,459
I don't think this is a good idea.


1004
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,095
You want me to win, don't you? I want you to win.



1005
01:12:34,096 --> 01:12:36,231
I just don't want tony to lose.


1006
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:41,336
Pool, 6:00 a.M.

1007
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:43,304
We'll be there to open it.


1008
01:12:57,319 --> 01:13:00,055
Your brother's looking pretty good in the water.



1009
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:01,856
Always did.

1010
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:05,993
He wanted to know if I'd room with him at the empire games.



1011
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:32,820
I can win this.

1012
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:36,724
Here to there and back.


1013
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:41,396
Announcer: Men's 100-meter backstroke event


1014
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:43,264
Should be a very close race.

1015
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,934
On your marks!

1016
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,174
 

1017
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:01,916
Announcer: Picking up their pace.


1018
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,418
Tony Fingleton and jason saunders


1019
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:05,553
Are leading by half a body length...


1020
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:06,787
Where's john, you bastard?


1021
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:08,289
...And john Fingleton in lane 6.


1022
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,758
Go, son. It's a very tight race.


1023
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:11,859
Shh shh.

1024
01:14:24,072 --> 01:14:25,840
Announcer: They're picking up their pace...


1025
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:37,818
It's saunders, vincent, and the Fingleton brothers.


1026
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:40,588
Could these brothers be going to the games?


1027
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:42,490
No. Here comes saunders...

1028
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:45,426
There's nothing between saunders and Fingleton.


1029
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:46,927
The crowd is going wild.

1030
01:14:46,928 --> 01:14:47,862
Here they come!

1031
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:53,635
Saunders has just beat Fingleton... Which one, you mongrel?



1032
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,936
We're waiting for the final results.


1033
01:14:55,937 --> 01:14:57,938
Followed by vincent in lane 3


1034
01:14:57,939 --> 01:15:00,007
And the other Fingleton in lane 6.


1035
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:01,276
It's john. He came 4th.


1036
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:02,544
Ladies and gentlemen...

1037
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:03,611
Tony made it.

1038
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:04,612
Tony did it!

1039
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:07,048
Tony made it! He did it!


1040
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:08,283
Yeah!

1041
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:09,617
Yes!

1042
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:12,853
Oh, harold, he did. Tony's in the empire games.


1043
01:15:12,854 --> 01:15:15,323
You have to be excited for him.


1044
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:18,693
Yep. The kid did it.

1045
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:21,128
Ron: Empire games! That's fantastic!


1046
01:15:21,129 --> 01:15:23,531
Diane: Come on, mum!

1047
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:24,732
Come on!

1048
01:15:31,773 --> 01:15:34,075
Pa: T.A.A. Welcomes our australian team


1049
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:36,511
Heading off to perth for the empire games.


1050
01:15:36,512 --> 01:15:38,646
Good luck to you all.

1051
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:03,838
Look, I know how much you wanted to make the team.


1052
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,844
I never thought I'd actually make it,


1053
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,679
But I always thought you would.


1054
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:18,519
Dad made it hard on both of us doing what he did.


1055
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:25,493
I wish I'd known what was going on. Why..?



1056
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:27,662
Why didn't you tell me?

1057
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:30,431
Dad didn't want me to tell you.


1058
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,001
I'd have told you.

1059
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,874
Since then it hasn't been the same, has it?


1060
01:16:44,413 --> 01:16:47,382
Dad thought it was the only way I could win.


1061
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:00,595
I want us to be friends again.

1062
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:02,530
Okay?

1063
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:06,100
The way we used to be.

1064
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,371
You're my brother.

1065
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:12,740
I love ya.

1066
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:19,647
John...

1067
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:31,559
They gave you a full scholarship?


1068
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,094
Yeah. Tuition, board, the whole thing.



1069
01:17:34,095 --> 01:17:36,597
All I had to do was scream for u.S.C.


1070
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:37,965
Which I wanted to do anyway.

1071
01:17:37,966 --> 01:17:39,099
Will you marry me, murray?


1072
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,668
You could probably get one, too.


1073
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:41,836
A full scholarship!

1074
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,472
Yeah. There's u.C.L.A., harvard, yale...


1075
01:17:44,473 --> 01:17:46,941
Harvard? Best college in the u.S.A.



1076
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:49,210
Yeah, I know. That's where president kennedy went.


1077
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,713
You need to write to the dean of admissions.


1078
01:17:51,714 --> 01:17:52,714
He'll help you.

1079
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,315
Can I have one of your swimsuits?


1080
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:56,050
One of my--

1081
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:57,051
Okay.

1082
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:58,953
They look better with you in them.


1083
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,594
Reporter: And here comes the australian team,


1084
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:08,730
Marching proudly into the stadium


1085
01:18:08,731 --> 01:18:13,000
With a magnificent reception from the crowd.


1086
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:14,836
And in the presence

1087
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:16,704
Of all the competitors,

1088
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:19,407
The officials, the spectators,


1089
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:22,076
I declare the vii british

1090
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,679
Empire and commonwealth games...


1091
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,980
Open.

1092
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:31,886
Ron, let it be-- I'm trying to get a clear picture!



1093
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:33,020
Leave it alone!

1094
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:34,154
That's it, that's it.

1095
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:36,257
I can't see. There's tony.


1096
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:40,561
He's going to win. I know it.


1097
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:42,397
He looks good.

1098
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,769
He looks like he's going to spew.


1099
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,236
On your marks!

1100
01:18:58,514 --> 01:18:59,647
 

1101
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,653
 

1102
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:21,201
Come on, mate.

1103
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:28,743
Come on, tony.

1104
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:30,010
Come on, tony.

1105
01:19:36,885 --> 01:19:39,787
That's his fastest split ever.

1106
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:02,009
He won!

1107
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,243
Ha ha ha!

1108
01:20:03,244 --> 01:20:04,846
 

1109
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:07,715
Check the times.

1110
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,526
Missed by a tenth of a second.

1111
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:21,729
But he won a silver medal! He still won a silver medal!


1112
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,063
Oh, my god!

1113
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,904
 

1114
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:31,238
Thank you.

1115
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:11,946
 

1116
01:21:11,947 --> 01:21:14,381
What are you doing?

1117
01:21:14,382 --> 01:21:16,017
Um...

1118
01:21:16,018 --> 01:21:19,286
Well, I'm just cutting out this thing of tony...


1119
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:23,591
Give it to me! It's mine! Give it to me!



1120
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,960
Jesus!

1121
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,365
Harold...

1122
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:34,168
Harold, just put the album...


1123
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:36,437
Just--just put it down.

1124
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:41,075
Come here! Come here!


1125
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:44,511
Leave me alone! Uhh! Uhh!


1126
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:45,846
Aah!

1127
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:49,784
Dora!

1128
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:54,755
Dora!

1129
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,526
Get back inside!

1130
01:22:05,266 --> 01:22:06,533
Come here!

1131
01:22:30,926 --> 01:22:33,360
Reporter: Here comes the plane carrying brisbane's own


1132
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:34,561
Tony Fingleton,

1133
01:22:34,562 --> 01:22:36,330
Silver medallist at the empire games


1134
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,766
And dual australian champion.

1135
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:41,068
I was so proud when I saw you


1136
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:43,004
Getting off the plane.

1137
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:44,005
Mum.

1138
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,305
It's on!

1139
01:22:45,306 --> 01:22:46,841
...One of australia's great swimmers,


1140
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:48,109
Tony Fingleton.

1141
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,611
Well, tony, with two australian championships...


1142
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:53,114
Harold, your kid's on the tv!


1143
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:55,683
What's it like having a kid as australian champ?


1144
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:59,153
What are your plans? More training for the tokyo olympics next year?



1145
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:03,090
I guess so. I've also got something interesting I'm waiting to hear about.



1146
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:07,762
It could be exciting, a big change, but I don't know yet.



1147
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,596
Whatever it is, good luck, tony,


1148
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:10,865
And welcome home.

1149
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:12,800
 

1150
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:18,272
I suppose I ought to give it to you.


1151
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:19,273
Give me what?

1152
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,842
It came last week.

1153
01:23:30,686 --> 01:23:33,453
"dear mr. Fingleton, "I'm delighted to inform you


1154
01:23:33,454 --> 01:23:35,622
"that the committee on admissions and financial aid


1155
01:23:35,623 --> 01:23:37,558
"has voted to off you a place in harvard.


1156
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:39,293
"please accept our personal congratulations


1157
01:23:39,294 --> 01:23:41,128
For your outstanding achievements."


1158
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:42,730
I'm in.

1159
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,566
They want to give me a full scholarship to harvard!


1160
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:46,567
I'm in!

1161
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:50,137
I don't want you to go.

1162
01:23:50,138 --> 01:23:53,140
You don't want me to go? Mum!

1163
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:55,209
Do you have any idea what this means?


1164
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:58,979
I don't want you to go, either.


1165
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,380
Come on! Come on!


1166
01:24:00,381 --> 01:24:04,752
You can't be serious! This is a full scholarship!


1167
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,339
Hi.

1168
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:29,777
America is straight ahead as far as you can go


1169
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,545
And a bit to the left.

1170
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,886
You think I'm deserting you, don't you?



1171
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:40,520
No.

1172
01:24:40,521 --> 01:24:42,556
Mum, I have to go.

1173
01:24:42,557 --> 01:24:44,792
You know I can't turn my back on this.


1174
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:47,928
Yeah. I'm just gonna miss you, that's all.



1175
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,434
I think I've lost you, anyhow.


1176
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:56,237
You're not going to come back.


1177
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:58,639
Mum, it's only for four years.


1178
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,474
I am coming back.

1179
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:06,180
Yeah...

1180
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:09,917
You're my hero.  


1181
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:11,551
Do you know that?

1182
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,299
I'll be okay.  


1183
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:28,468
You sure? Yeah, yeah.


1184
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:30,271
No more...

1185
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:32,006
No.

1186
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:33,841
No, he can't hurt me anymore.

1187
01:25:33,842 --> 01:25:35,509
That's all fine.

1188
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:39,113
Knowing you're going to harvard makes everything fine.


1189
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:40,948
Harvard! Imagine!

1190
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:45,853
I wonder if you'll see president kennedy?


1191
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,689
And that beautiful thing, his wife?


1192
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,025
And all those american girls.

1193
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:53,894
They're so...Beautiful.

1194
01:25:53,895 --> 01:25:56,063
I know you have to do this.

1195
01:25:56,064 --> 01:25:59,867
I know you...I know you have to get away from this.


1196
01:26:03,338 --> 01:26:05,439
I'm okay. I don't matter.

1197
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,342
Mum, you do matter. I really, I truly don't matter.



1198
01:26:08,343 --> 01:26:09,343
You do.

1199
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:12,046
I'm just...

1200
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:14,849
I'm just a bit frightened, that's all.


1201
01:26:17,518 --> 01:26:20,988
I'm just a bit frightened of the future.


1202
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,708
[chopin's minute waltz playing]


1203
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:42,843
G'day.

1204
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:46,313
Tony.

1205
01:26:46,314 --> 01:26:48,315
Can I come in?

1206
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:50,084
Yeah, sure.

1207
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:52,119
Make yourself at home.

1208
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:58,525
My back's been giving me hell.

1209
01:26:58,526 --> 01:27:00,127
Chopin's minute waltz.

1210
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:01,695
Some russian drongo.

1211
01:27:01,696 --> 01:27:03,697
Seems to be taking him hours.

1212
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:18,379
There's a beer in the fridge if you want one.



1213
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:19,880
Oh, no. I'm fine.

1214
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:21,581
There's only one.

1215
01:27:21,582 --> 01:27:23,217
It's a bit of a test.

1216
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:24,885
All right.

1217
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:26,720
How're you doing?

1218
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:28,555
Nine weeks...

1219
01:27:28,556 --> 01:27:29,790
Four days.

1220
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,159
Well, pretty good, dad.

1221
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:41,302
Uh, my boat leaves tonight.

1222
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:43,537
Yeah, so I hear.

1223
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:46,307
Yeah.

1224
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:49,009
I just wanted to say good-bye.


1225
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:53,447
Harvard.

1226
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:55,816
Certainly didn't see that one coming.


1227
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:03,190
Well, it's the swimming that got me there.


1228
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:04,491
Yeah.

1229
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:06,026
You're good at it.

1230
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:08,429
Thanks.

1231
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:14,601
It means a lot to hear you say that to me.


1232
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,609
Dad, I had a choice.

1233
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,879
It was the olympics or harvard.


1234
01:28:30,885 --> 01:28:32,886
I was um...

1235
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:34,254
Gonna take a walk.

1236
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:39,293
Do you wanna come? Yeah.


1237
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:48,602
My boat leaves from here tonight.


1238
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:52,373
Yeah. I won't be coming down.

1239
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:54,141
Your mother knows that.

1240
01:28:57,678 --> 01:28:59,679
Hi, bruce. Hi, howard.


1241
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,183
Do you remember the first time you took me to the pool, dad?


1242
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:05,152
Put me in the water?

1243
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:10,357
I do. At the old spring hill baths.


1244
01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:14,128
I remember being terrified of drowning.


1245
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:17,231
You had me there, and then you just...


1246
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:19,933
You just let me go.

1247
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,837
I remember that. Yeah.


1248
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:26,373
But I didn't go under, I floated.


1249
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:28,208
And then, uh...

1250
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:30,877
And then I swam away from you.


1251
01:29:30,878 --> 01:29:35,015
And I swam away...

1252
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:39,453
Across to the other side, maybe, but...


1253
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:45,192
I should go. I've got things to do.


1254
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:48,495
I'm going to go and chat to a couple of mates.


1255
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:49,596
Yeah.

1256
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,642
You've got guts.

1257
01:30:07,182 --> 01:30:09,816
Is there anything I can do for you, dad?


1258
01:30:11,852 --> 01:30:14,088
No.

1259
01:30:14,089 --> 01:30:17,724
I'll be okay.

1260
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:20,527
Don't give up on me, son.

1261
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:47,154
Tony: It's funny how the stumbling blocks of life


1262
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:49,490
Can help make us better people.

1263
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:52,292
I never had the support of my father,


1264
01:30:52,293 --> 01:30:54,694
But in the end that's what gave me the strength


1265
01:30:54,695 --> 01:30:56,997
To seek something more than I could've ever imagined...


1266
01:30:58,766 --> 01:31:00,700
Something in another world.

1267
01:31:11,912 --> 01:31:15,349
Your event was today. I was just looking at the results.



1268
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,917
Bet you wish you were there, too, huh?


1269
01:31:17,918 --> 01:31:20,720
No. I'm exactly where I wanna be.


1270
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:24,291
Here? I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world.



1271
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:28,295
Be nice to win an olympic medal, though, huh?


1272
01:31:28,296 --> 01:31:31,798
Someone once told me that if you're a nobody without a medal,



1273
01:31:31,799 --> 01:31:33,433
You're still a nobody with one.


1274
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:38,672
Would you do us a favor?

1275
01:31:38,673 --> 01:31:39,739
Thanks.

1276
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:47,047
Young tony: We've got the pool all to ourselves.


1277
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:48,215
Yay!

1278
01:31:48,216 --> 01:31:50,617
Whoa!

1279
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:58,925
 

1280
01:31:58,926 --> 01:32:01,895
Dora: Are you as strong as I think you are?


1281
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,333
...In the head.

1282
01:32:17,945 --> 01:32:21,114
John: You know I'd never do anything to hurt you.


1283
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:32,292
Harold, jr: You were always a fighter.


1284
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:34,228
Show dad what you're made of.


1285
01:32:48,843 --> 01:32:50,410
Harold: Backstroke's definitely your strength,


1286
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:51,845
That's good!

1287
01:32:51,846 --> 01:32:54,615
And nobody's going to take that away from you.


1288
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,792
Dora: Only you can make something of yourself,


1289
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:08,395
Not your father and not me.


1290
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:22,041
Look at your time!

1291
01:33:24,845 --> 01:33:27,247
That was the swim of your life, man.
