was on the block,

and set it off.

268

Then I would disappear.
Just vanish.

269
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,375
So they started
calling me "Oxygen."

270
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:49,442
It got so crazy,
they just doubled it up,
started calling me O2.

272
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,422
Before I got locked up.

273
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:57,222
So you couldn't vanish
when it counted most, huh?

274
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,361
How long?

275
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,659
I did six years.

00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,065
Only been out
on parole for a month.

277
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:08,594
So, I suppose shooting
up people and having
a gun and all that shit

278
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:10,971
is probably a violation
of your parole, huh?

00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:14,467

the gun if the dude

to replace me
would have showed up.

284
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,344
So you stole it?

285
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,717
I was going to
take the gun back.

286
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,221

You getting money?

510
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,701
Yeah, something like that.

511
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,206
Shit. You better, man.
You gonna have it by tomorrow?

512
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,839
I don't know, man. We'll see.

513
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,504
I'm out here trying to
do what I can.

514
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,612
And these streets
ain't no joke, dawg.

515

a holler if you
need something, man.</i>

<i>I'm out here
doing my thing, so...</i>

517
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,984
Hey, Lucky, let me
call you right back, boy.

518
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,617
Did you see that?

519
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:40,392
The limo?
Yeah, there's a lot
of rich folks up here...

520
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:43,023
No, he looked like
he was leaving town.

521
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,693
So?
So we need us
a spot we can lay low in.

522
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:48,533
Can't keep driving around
with all this jewelry
and money in the car.

523
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,266
Yeah, but how do you know
there's not still family

524
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,364
back up in that house?

525
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:52,738
Because if somebody
was in the house,

526
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,970
they'd have came out
to kiss him goodbye
or something.

527
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,770
I think I can disarm it.

528
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,105
How do you know?

529
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,706
Because I used to do security.

530
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,409
Was that before
or after you went to jail?

531
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:37,817
After.

532
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:39,883
And now you're breaking
into folks' homes.

533
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,152
Man.
Shit.

534
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,220

537
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:54,000

538
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,935

Wait, hold on!

539

I let my maid go home.

548

No, I'm sorry.
There is no Mrs. Bennett.

Oh, sorry.
I forgot about the alarm.
Bad habit.

Yes, I do.

No, don't tell us.

562
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:18,845
Could you activate
and then deactivate
the alarm for us, please?

563
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:20,041

00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,371
Mr. Bennett is in Paris
for a couple days.

570
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,212
Exactly what is
your relationship
with Mr. Bennett?

571
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:56,746
I'm his assistant.

572
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,582
I'm gonna be housesitting
while he's gone.

573
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:09,064
You know, it makes me feel
really safe that
the cops respond so quickly.

574
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:15,332
I'm gonna be here alone
for a couple days,
and I get kind of nervous.

maybe I need some help,

if I called you?

579
