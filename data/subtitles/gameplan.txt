1
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,237
All right, all right. All right, all right.

2
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:16,884
Never

3
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,262
say

4
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:20,473
no.

5
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:39,945
Well, this is Kingman's
defining moment, Marv.

6
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,620
If they win, they guarantee themselves
a spot in the playoffs.

7
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,079
Everybody get on the King's back

8
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,871
and I'm going to lead you
to the promised land.

9
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:48,162
-All right? On one, on one. Ready?
-Break!

10
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,329
-Go deep.
-Watch your left!

11
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,497
Let's go!

12
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,293
Pick him up. Pick him up.

13
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:55,132
Sanders. Sanders.

14
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:57,843
Go wide!

15
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,137
Hut-hut!

16
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:00,263
Hut!

17
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,475
All right, here's Kingman.
Drops back in the pocket.

18
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:06,689
He's got Sanders wide open
in the end zone.

19
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,765
Kingman is on the run.
He's inside the f.ive.

20
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,486
He stif.f.-arms. It's the Kingman swing.

21
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:17,781
And he is in! Touchdown, Rebels.
They've won it.

22
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,654
What a tremendous play by Kingman,
Marv.

23
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,163
But I have to wonder,
yesterday he was...

24
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,163
The King does it again!

25
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,500
-Go Joe!
-Go Joe!

26
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,511
-Never say no!
-Never say no!

27
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:35,632
Yeah!

28
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,975
WZPZ FM.

29
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:53,356
Hey, Boston. Happy New Year.
And a special shout out to our Rebels.

30
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,901
Don't party too hard, boys.

31
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,865
You're going to need all your strength
to bring home that championship.

32
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,401
-Enjoy your drink.
-To us.

33
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,536
Hope it's okay.

34
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,992
I'm telling you guys,
these aren't the normal onion rings.

35
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:10,954
They got garlic and mint leaves.
I mean, like, beluga caviar.

36
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,297
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.

37
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:16,509
-See the hottie? 1 2 o'clock, tan dress?
-Oh, yeah.

38
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,216
I think she said
you have a killer smile, bro.

39
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,545
I do.

40
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,052
You should go talk to her.

41
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:24,141
-You think so?
-I know so. Come on.

42
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:28,350
Get in there. Get in there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.

43
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:30,226
Use some of this. Chicks dig it.

44
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,733
-Webber, you got a pen?
-Why?

45
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:35,613
Because you might want
to take some notes.

46
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,524
What's up?

47
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:52,750
Webber!

48
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,007
I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

49
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,968
But Tatianna will miss you.

50
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,514
The King doesn't want his queen
to miss him too much.

51
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,851
So I got you a little something special.

52
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,601
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

53
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:14,314
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one?
Which one?

54
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,774
No peeking.

55
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,485
Dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.

56
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,197
Happy New Year.

57
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,821
-Channel?
-Or Chanel.

58
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,542
Whoa, Sanders. Where you going?

59
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:36,206
Just past your bedtime?

60
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,586
Yeah, well, you know,
it's New Year's Eve.

61
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,843
Want to go home,
hug the wife, kiss the kids.

62
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,512
All right, thanks for coming.
Happy New Year.

63
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,345
-All right, Happy New Year.
-All right, see you at practice.

64
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:47,889
All right, see you.

65
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,346
All right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.

66
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,762
Now, just give me back the wallet,
all right?

67
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,901
I'm looking to confiscate
Sanders' man card,

68
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,355
but his wife, Maria,
has already done it.

69
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:02,451
-Yes, really...
-Come on. Get a life, Sanders.

70
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,863
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

71
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,120
-Whatever.
-He's mad. That was funny, man.

72
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,663
-Who's ready to party?
-I am.

73
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:15,127
Party!

74
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,586
Yeah!

75
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,966
Where can I get a man card?

76
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,555
-Why? The night is still young!
-We can walk Spike.

77
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,230
-Play the guitars, Joe. Come on.
-We were just bonding.

78
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:31,731
-I love that idea.
-We're starting to jell.

79
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,353
-Call me.
-Joe...

80
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,319
We were doing so good.

81
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,786
Hey, Spike. There's my boy.
Haven't seen you all night.

82
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:47,956
Do you know who the greatest
quarterback of all time is?

83
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,206
Just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!

84
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:54,588
Can you feel it? Can you smell it?
Do you believe it?

85
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,752
Z-slant Mississippi! On three. Ready?
Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!

86
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,793
Come on, Spike.
We need a football biscuit.

87
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,502
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, this is a good one.

88
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,427
Kingman drops back, he's...
Oh, defenders are coming around.

89
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,762
Post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.
He throws.

90
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:11,935
Touchdown! They're going crazy.

91
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,975
Crazy.

92
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,783
Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.

93
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,914
What do you want to do, Spike?
What do you want to do today?

94
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,591
It's a new year.

95
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:41,626
You want to play football?
You want to go for a walk?

96
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,720
You want to watch the new ESPN
special profile on Joe Kingman?

97
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,222
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch.
Here we go.

98
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,636
Attaboy.

99
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,275
Blessed with crazy strength and
ridiculous agility...

100
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:58,481
Ridiculous.

101
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,274
...Joe Kingman could have succeeded
on talent alone.

102
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:03,236
But what really sets
this f.uture hall-of.-f.amer apart

103
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,909
is his passion f.or the game.

104
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,788
And no one sums it up better
than Joe himself..

105
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,990
-Wait a minute, that's not what I said.
-Listen, listen.

106
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,118
-What I said was this. Lif.e...
-Life...

107
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,210
-...holds many pleasures f.or me.
-...holds many pleasures for me.

108
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,831
-But...
-But...

109
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,457
-...nothing...
-...nothing...

110
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,333
-...nothing beats the thrill...
-...nothing beats the thrill...

111
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,259
-...of. playing on that f.ield...
-...of playing on that field...

112
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,417
-...every Sunday.
-...every Sunday.

113
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:25,009
-Football is my lif.e.
-Football is my life.

114
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,514
-Beyond the f.ield...
-Beyond the field...

115
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,801
-...nothing else matters.
-...nothing else matters. Watch this.

116
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:30,967
Nothing.

117
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,429
If. nothing else really matters,

118
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:36,899
why does that championship ring
elude Kingman?

119
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,395
Some of. the experts say
it's because he's too self.ish.

120
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,191
I mean, think about it...

121
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:46,652
How does that sound, Stuey?

122
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:50,200
Joe, you're a 30-something now,
not a 20-something.

123
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,873
The clock is ticking, Joe.
Ticking on your career.

124
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:57,371
Blah, blah, blah...

125
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:01,375
You come talk to me when you have
your own action figure, Stuey.

126
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,051
-Yeah?
-Pardon me, Mr Kingman.

127
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,808
I have a visitor here at reception.

128
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:12,977
-A Peyton Kelly, sir.
-I don't know any Peytons.

129
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,690
A young lady.

130
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,817
-ls she cute?
-Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

131
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:22,063
Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

132
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,109
He never says "no."

133
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,567
I am the king. Thank you very much.

134
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:31,779
Look out.

135
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,084
Hello.

136
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,713
-Goodbye.
-Hey!

137
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:50,303
Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

138
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:51,679
You don't get abs like these

139
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,350
eating Peanut Butter Patties,
you know?

140
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,347
Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.

141
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,114
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

142
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,490
Bye-bye.

143
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:13,623
It's ridiculous.

144
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:22,456
I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

145
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,750
I don't want any money. I want...

146
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,587
I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

147
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:32,057
An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

148
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,759
You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

149
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,889
Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

150
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,230
Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

151
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:43,020
You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

152
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,357
You're so cute.

153
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:48,066
Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

154
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:50,158
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

155
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:54,368
Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

156
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,745
There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

157
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:58,835
-Didn't your mom ever teach you that?
-Yeah.

158
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,335
-Well, where is she?
-On an aeroplane.

159
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,624
On an aeroplane?
Well, who are you here with?

160
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,755
My father.

161
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:07,638
Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

162
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,799
-He's not looking for me.
-How do you know?

163
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:13,970
Because he's looking at me.

164
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,472
What?

165
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:21,517
Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

166
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,980
Sara Kelly?

167
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:27,445
My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.

168
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:00,644
No. No. Nope. No!

169
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,558
No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

170
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,739
-She wrote you a note.
-Wrote me a note.

171
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:27,256
"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

172
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:30,969
"l need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

173
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:34,264
"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara."

174
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,764
You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

175
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:40,980
You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

176
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,979
-Anybody could have written this.
-Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,822
I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

178
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,609
Birth certificate?

179
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,615
-Your name is on it.
-My name is...

180
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:58,955
My name?

181
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,365
Awesome!

182
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,582
Ready? Break!

183
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,754
My name's not on this.

184
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:06,788
"Joseph Kingman."

185
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,460
Hut! Hut! Hut!

186
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,966
-We've got a situation.
-Touchdown!

187
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:20,971
Fix it.

188
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:26,311
Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

189
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,687
-I didn't know.
-You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

190
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:31,823
That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

191
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:35,818
Didn't even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

192
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,533
Okay, but for argument's sake,

193
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:41,828
is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

194
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,000
Think hard.

195
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,460
I don't know.

196
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,500
We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

197
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:50,919
she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...

198
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,133
We...

199
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,592
Is anyone else hungry?

200
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,686
-Hungry?
-Joe...

201
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:04,017
When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

202
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,277
About eight, nine years ago.

203
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,360
-How old are you, kid?
-Eight.

204
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:10,865
Congratulations, Joe.

205
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:13,360
This isn't happening to me.

206
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:18,370
Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

207
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:23,373
It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

208
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,875
She's on her way to Africa.

209
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:28,793
What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

210
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:33,302
She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

211
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,265
to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

212
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:39,760
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

213
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,389
So on her way to save the world,

214
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,977
your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

215
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:48,817
I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

216
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:53,192
And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet." And I said...

217
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:56,943
I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

218
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,326
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

219
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,833
Sara has a sister.

220
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:08,452
Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

221
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,749
-Karen.
-Karen. What about her?

222
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,011
She's...

223
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,422
She's dead.

224
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,384
Oh, that's convenient.

225
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,342
What?

226
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,605
How do we get in touch
with your mom?

227
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:25,772
-Her cell won't work in Kassala.
-Email?

228
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,644
They don't have lnternet there.

229
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,272
How did you get here again?

230
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:33,105
We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

231
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,116
And the car just magically
dropped you off at some man's house?

232
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:42,326
-Not some man. My father.
-So you say.

233
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,290
-Want a paternity test?
-Yes. That's a great idea.

234
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,296
Let's do that. No problem.

235
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:51,044
I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

236
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,260
Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

237
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,546
These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

238
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,796
If she does turn out to be yours,

239
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,806
you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

240
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,390
and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

241
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,684
Stella.

242
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,976
We don't even look alike.

243
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,026
Oh, no. Not at all.

244
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:20,329
-Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
-Hey, I told you she was cute.

245
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,673
I'm late.

246
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,758
Let's go. No huddle.

247
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,058
-No back seat.
-So what? Get in the car.

248
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,520
If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

249
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,397
Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

250
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,186
Come here.

251
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,259
So late.

252
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,796
I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

253
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,009
so let's get started, shall we?

254
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,519
I'm going to ask you some questions

255
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,853
and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

256
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,476
Now, for example,

257
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,986
if you asked me what my favourite
thing to do was, I would say ballet.

258
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,069
So what's your favourite thing to do?

259
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,356
That's easy. Play football.

260
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,951
Football.

261
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,276
Come on!

262
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,287
If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

263
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,374
My Heisman.

264
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,294
No, wait... I know.

265
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,459
My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

266
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,932
Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

267
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,851
Just one more question.

268
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:09,145
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

269
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,646
Listen, I got a question for you.

270
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,445
Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

271
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,944
Want a cookie?

272
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,317
No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

273
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,326
But you said you were hungry.

274
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,953
-And I made them special for you.
-Fine, fine.

275
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,538
-Now, about your mom.
-I told you, it was last-minute.

276
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,914
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

277
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,750
would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.

278
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:46,726
I know what happened.

279
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,230
-You do?
-Yeah.

280
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,685
-She's gained a lot of weight.
-No.

281
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,228
What's she pushing now? About 180?

282
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,479
Deuce?

283
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,195
Let's go.

284
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,790
What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

285
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,246
This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

286
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,413
Are you okay?

287
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,085
Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

288
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,633
-Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
-Cinnamon!

289
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,304
Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

290
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,972
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

291
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,976
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

292
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,151
I'm allergic to nuts.

293
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:38,481
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

294
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:40,691
-You have to be there this time.
-I'll be there.

295
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:42,284
What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

296
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,036
Stop touching me.

297
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,080
Stop eating so much.

298
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,576
-You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
-Start a tab.

299
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:54,210
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

300
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:58,921
King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

301
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,092
Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

302
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,432
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

303
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,186
Suffering succotash, Sylvester,

304
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:12,813
something seems to be wrong
with your mouth.

305
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,690
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three.
On three. Ready?

306
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:21,032
Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

307
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,858
-I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.
-What's everybody staring at?

308
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:27,153
I didn't know Joe had a kid.

309
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,615
Yo, I don't think Joe knew
Joe had a kid.

310
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,332
-Stay here.
-Yes, sir.

311
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:45,506
Hat.

312
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,633
Give me this!

313
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:49,643
Here's what you got to read right there.
You all set?

314
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,306
Here we go. And three, two, one... Go!

315
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:56,893
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!

316
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,032
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.

317
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:07,696
Boston Rebels! Feel the...
Wait a minute. Who writes this?

318
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hey, let's get Joe.
He won't be expecting it.

319
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:15,001
We'll put ice in his bath.

320
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,798
Coop, look. Look real close.

321
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,415
Joe is in an ice bath.

322
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,554
-Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
-Glove.

323
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,054
Yeah.

324
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:30,977
Webber, think about this.

325
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,973
Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

326
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:36,519
More like a safety blitz.

327
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:37,730
Yeah, well, you should be happy.

328
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,028
I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

329
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:45,023
-Yeah, but you knew they were coming.
-Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

330
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:48,951
What's your name, sweetheart?

331
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,825
-Peyton.
-Peyton, that's cute.

332
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,451
-Hi, Peyton.
-Hi.

333
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:55,669
Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

334
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,001
No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

335
00:22:58,132 --> 00:22:59,710
No. Peyton Rous.

336
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,967
-Who's that?
-He won the Nobel Prize.

337
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,556
For what team?

338
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:12,222
In medicine.

339
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:16,935
He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

340
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:19,273
"Stupid" is a mean word.

341
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,814
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

342
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:21,978
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

343
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,145
-lsn't.
-ls!

344
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,362
-lsn't.
-ls!

345
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,284
Quiet. Both of you.

346
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:38,830
Step away from my pants.

347
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:41,215
Awkward.

348
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:43,844
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

349
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,259
See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

350
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:48,263
You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

351
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:50,300
or he thinks we won't win.

352
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,470
Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.

353
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:58,982
I'm hungry.

354
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,445
Please don't touch anything.
Stand right here.

355
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,064
Tonight's Tuesday.
We're going to carbo-load.

356
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,526
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.

357
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:09,657
What?

358
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:13,289
Hey, do you have any Jell-O?
I want some Jell-O.

359
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,955
Like I said, please don't touch.
Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.

360
00:24:17,086 --> 00:24:18,165
Stand right here, don't do anything.

361
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:20,788
I'm not giving you 28 grams
of empty carbohydrates.

362
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:23,877
We do not do simple sugars
in this house.

363
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,961
But I'm a kid and kids love sugar.
I mean, the simpler the better.

364
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:29,890
Well, my dad never let me have sugar.

365
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:32,769
Oh, is that why you never smile?

366
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:47,324
Listen, you better eat your food
before it gets cold.

367
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,359
But it's as big as a mountain.

368
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:53,862
Listen, if you're going to make the pros,
you have to get your appetite up.

369
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,458
Let's go. Eat.

370
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,996
You got a little...

371
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,334
-A little something right here.
-What?

372
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:05,208
I got what?

373
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:15,766
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.

374
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:17,391
You can eat.

375
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:21,519
And finish eating.

376
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:32,494
I don't have a guest room
because I don't like guests.

377
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,281
But you can sleep here.

378
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,905
-What's this?
-That is a universal remote.

379
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,451
It controls the world.
And you don't need to touch it.

380
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:41,580
What's the "romance" button for?

381
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:46,541
The romance button
is for a little Valentine's Day magic.

382
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,390
Turn... Turn this off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

383
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,891
Turn it off. Press the button.
Turn it off.

384
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,689
Stop touching things.

385
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:10,075
Aren't you going to tell me
a bedtime story?

386
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,443
Bedtime story... Bedtime story.

387
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,240
Yeah.

388
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:24,506
The Big Bad Wolf

389
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,205
blew down the Grammy's house

390
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:30,261
and ate the Goldilocks

391
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,593
and then there was something
about the porridge.

392
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,888
The end.

393
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,217
Good night.

394
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:38,760
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.

395
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:44,772
A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

396
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,778
I'll show you.

397
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,740
Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

398
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:54,617
Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

399
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:57,583
Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

400
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,795
Once upon a time there was a princess

401
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,789
and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

402
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,627
She had a pink dress, a red dress,

403
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,128
a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

404
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,301
-an orange dress, a yellow dress...
-I get it. I get it. I get it.

405
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:15,634
A lot of dresses, a lot of colours.
So what?

406
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,472
So each dress had a secret power.

407
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:23,980
The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

408
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,103
could make her fly.

409
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:30,982
And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

410
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,324
could make her tiny.

411
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:38,579
And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

412
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,830
could make her sleep.

413
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:02,935
Whoa!

414
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:07,898
Hey, baby.

415
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:10,107
Why didn't you answer me
when I called?

416
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,319
I was starting to get worried.

417
00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:15,406
I'm sorry. I forgot I had
my phone turned off from the flight.

418
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:19,493
Well, I'm just happy that you got
there safely. So, how's it going?

419
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:25,249
Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

420
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:27,414
Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

421
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,837
I mean, is it as good as they promised?

422
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,378
Too soon to tell.

423
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:35,461
Hey, listen, sweetie,
it's almost time for my flight to take off,

424
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,719
but I will call you
as soon as I can, okay?

425
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:41,095
I miss you so much already.

426
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,394
E-mail me lots of pictures.
And Peyton, I love you.

427
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,852
I love you, too. Bye.

428
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:53,778
Is there a ballet school close by?

429
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,413
Spike?

430
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,664
Why is my dog in a dress
with pink nail polish?

431
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:09,922
He's learning Swan Lake.

432
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,093
Do you know how to fix
a ballerina bun?

433
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,673
Do I look like I know
how to fix a ballerina bun?

434
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:29,482
My mom says we're not supposed to
pop our knuckles.

435
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,901
Well, your mom
didn't sleep on a hard sofa

436
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:36,029
instead of her specially designed
$10,000 orthopaedic bed

437
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:40,454
made by Dr Johan Gustavo,
of Switzerland.

438
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:48,505
-What's... What's with the Beethoven?
-It's Tchaikovsky.

439
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,874
-Do you listen to this every morning?
-No.

440
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:54,840
Sometimes I listen to Bach,
or Rachmaninoff...

441
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,010
Do you have an iPod?

442
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,762
Because I'm going to buy you one.
Immediately. Right now.

443
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:05,019
I'm going to buy you an iPod.

444
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:08,483
Until then...

445
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,192
What is this?

446
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:18,368
My Bedazzler.
Doesn't Camille look pretty?

447
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:19,693
A Bedazzler?

448
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:26,958
And that's why I use
tuna for protein and flavour.

449
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:31,048
-Gross.
-Little liquid chickens.

450
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,260
Yeah, that's my favourite.

451
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,343
Joe's juice.

452
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,310
Okay. That's enough.

453
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:44,892
I'm gonna need you to drink up.

454
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:48,308
You'll be running the 40
in under 4.5 in no time.

455
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:53,103
That smells worse than school food.

456
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,276
You know, speaking of school,
why aren't you in it?

457
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:00,493
-I'm on break.
-ln January? No you're not.

458
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:05,035
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school,
so I have January off.

459
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,827
Really? Well, guess what?
I'm not on break.

460
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:09,202
As a matter of fact,
I'm on the opposite of break.

461
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:10,417
So I'm gonna need you
to come over here,

462
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,257
put some hustle in it,
and drink your breakfast.

463
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,759
-Peyton, stop messing around.
-What?

464
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:14,916
Peyton!

465
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,048
No!

466
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,313
Nice.

467
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,980
That's real nice.

468
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:45,993
-You know what a playbook is?
-I'm guessing it's a book with plays?

469
00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:51,871
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses
and the Os for hugs.

470
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:55,044
Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house."

471
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:56,801
The O's mean "open access."

472
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:59,964
For example, you want to go
to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.

473
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:02,885
But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

474
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,142
Off limits. No access.

475
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,940
Can't go there, because you made
a mess in the kitchen.

476
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:09,309
Do you understand?

477
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:11,848
No trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?

478
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,644
Got it. No flea-flickers.

479
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:16,490
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

480
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:16,573
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

481
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:22,365
That's it, boys. Practice is over.

482
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,416
Pick a nanny, Joe.

483
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:30,961
I'll take the one at...

484
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:34,708
Don't you think
you should ask some questions first?

485
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,133
I've got great instincts.

486
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,009
The one on the end, Stella.

487
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:42,172
Edna.

488
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,387
The other end, Stella.

489
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,150
Blondie, you're up.

490
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,902
Oh, no. No.

491
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,903
The King picked me!

492
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:08,205
We are going to be just like sisters!

493
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,085
Oh, my goodness.

494
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:11,499
You start tomorrow.

495
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:16,424
Hey. You're going
to the opening tonight, right?

496
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:20,386
It's my restaurant.

497
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,888
Well, what are you
going to do with her?

498
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,025
I don't know.

499
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:40,771
Hi. Hello.

500
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,248
Welcome, Mr Kingman.

501
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,826
-The Maloofs!
-About time, there, Joe.

502
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,159
You made it. Have fun.

503
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,291
-Yeah.
-Enjoy yourself.

504
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,877
-Hey, Joe.
-Hey, man.

505
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,208
-How you doing?
-Hey.

506
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,468
-Jo Jo!
-Hey, nice to see you.

507
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:04,261
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.

508
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,099
And that's exactly what I said.
I told them.

509
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,019
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest."

510
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:13,811
The purple or the yellow?

511
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,284
That's what I was thinking, too.

512
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,202
I'll be back.

513
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:40,335
Water the lawn. Water the lawn.

514
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,637
Hey, great night, Mr Kingman.

515
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:45,088
Indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.

516
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:47,052
Hey, Joe! This way!

517
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:50,471
Number one on the field
and number one in your heart.

518
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:59,275
I've got sunshine

519
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:02,360
On a cloudy day

520
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:03,487
Yes, I do.

521
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,036
When it's cold outside

522
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,286
I've got the month of. May

523
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:18,413
I guess you'd say

524
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:21,423
What can make me

525
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,545
f.eel this way

526
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:24,675
My girl

527
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:25,838
Joe?

528
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,637
My girl

529
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:30,139
Talking about my girl

530
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,264
My girl... Peyton!

531
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,268
Joe?

532
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,521
Joe. Joe, where are you?

533
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,492
There you are.
Joe, I thought you forgot about me.

534
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:50,539
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!

535
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,159
-Hey, Joe, is that your daughter?
-Peyton!

536
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,036
Hey, Joe, you forget something?

537
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:55,579
Father of the year!

538
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,255
Yesterday, Fanny's Burgers
agreed to hand out

539
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:06,222
your action figure
with every order of fries.

540
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,222
But do you think
they're going to want a spokesman

541
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:11,434
who forgot his child in a bar?

542
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:16,186
My mom says that Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

543
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,777
Well, your daddy's agent says
Fanny's makes him fat with cash.

544
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:25,902
Now, I have to put together
a press conference, do some cleanup.

545
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:29,155
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop,
and Peyton's the mess.

546
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,159
What?

547
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,293
-Something funny, Larry?
-Just a little throat tickle, sir.

548
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:41,166
Well, get it fixed.

549
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,257
Right here. Chop-chop.

550
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:48,215
You got a station wagon, Stella?

551
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,259
No, you did.

552
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:54,643
Say "bye-bye" to being
the Big Bad Dad of Boston.

553
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,567
Oh, no.

554
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:05,146
Oh, yes.

555
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,454
You want me to sign that?

556
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:17,748
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl
and cooperate with your daddy

557
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,628
and Auntie Stella will get you a nice
new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.

558
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,965
And an upgrade
on your next international flight.

559
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,130
I'm eight.

560
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,717
Listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt,

561
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:35,137
you will do whatever it takes
to help your father.

562
00:37:37,525 --> 00:37:39,398
I'll pay for the therapy.

563
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:42,943
Listen, Peyton,
what Stella's trying to say here is

564
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:44,483
this right now is crunch time.

565
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:46,322
So, if something's bothering you,
then all you got to do...

566
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,072
Let's keep it bottled up
until after the playoffs.

567
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:50,235
Fine.

568
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,367
On one condition.

569
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,489
No nanny.

570
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:57,907
No way.

571
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:04,550
Hey...

572
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:08,675
-Let's go. Come on.
-I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.

573
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:10,931
Everything's all...

574
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:14,353
-Dizzy?
-I think it might be

575
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:18,856
from that funny yellow soft drink
Joe gave me last night.

576
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,190
What was it called again?

577
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,356
Margarita?

578
00:38:24,822 --> 00:38:26,197
-You wouldn't.
-You wouldn't.

579
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:27,983
Try me.

580
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:32,693
Good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!

581
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:34,538
Hey, Cindy!

582
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,210
You're fired.

583
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:39,875
Bye.

584
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:43,543
Joe! Joe!

585
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:45,217
Hey, Joe,
how can you remember the plays

586
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:46,836
when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

587
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:51,014
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

588
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,891
Thank you. Thank you guys
so much f.or coming out.

589
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,347
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,

590
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:56,557
thank you so much f.or coming.

591
00:38:56,688 --> 00:38:58,929
Great questions, by the way.
Thank you.

592
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:04,605
As you all know by now,
I've recently learned I'm a f.ather.

593
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,733
And clearly,
I'm still getting the hang of. things.

594
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,367
That's not an excuse, Joe.

595
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:18,827
But you better believe that Peyton's
nightclub evenings are behind her.

596
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,958
Because f.rom now on, we're both
going to be going to sleep early, right?

597
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:26,802
Now, who's number one on the f.ield
and number one in your heart?

598
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,422
Let's go.

599
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,601
Can I say something, please?

600
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,893
No. Let's go.

601
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:44,268
Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,

602
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:47,523
the one who'll be going to bed early
f.rom now on.

603
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,702
My dad didn't have much of.
a heads-up on this whole f.ather thing

604
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:00,581
and he is still
getting the hang of. things.

605
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,961
But it's like everything else in his lif.e.

606
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,797
He never says "no. "

607
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,503
I mean, he's teaching me
that you can do anything

608
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:13,338
if. you've got motivation
and determination.

609
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:17,224
And the place where that starts

610
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:22,438
is right here, in the heart.

611
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,434
You're the world's greatest f.ather.

612
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,324
That was good.

613
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:35,193
-That was really good.
-It's going to cost you.

614
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:45,295
...two, three, four, grand plié...

615
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:47,380
There you go, there you go.

616
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:49,498
And...

617
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:52,795
Come on, this isn't a sport.

618
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,219
Football. Football's a sport.

619
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:57,889
Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

620
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,847
Hello. This is Peyton.

621
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:03,724
-Hi.
-And she's here for this.

622
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,559
So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

623
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:08,652
Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

624
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,773
and we don't accept students
without an audition

625
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:13,862
and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

626
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:18,242
I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

627
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,699
Money's no object,
as you probably know.

628
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:25,369
Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

629
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:29,384
-That's very nice.
-Thank you.

630
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,088
Go change, go on, go change.

631
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,130
Let me see how she does today. Okay?

632
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:34,592
All right.

633
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,351
Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

634
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:50,813
The moms sit over there.

635
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,114
Excuse me. Thank you.

636
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:05,460
And one, two, three, very long...

637
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:07,465
Come on, come on.

638
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,967
And one, two, three, four.

639
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,800
Open up, like a princess, chin up.

640
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,175
Thank you.

641
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:18,764
Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

642
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:23,639
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

643
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:24,804
Thank you.

644
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,981
Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

645
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,108
But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

646
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,568
we'd love to have you.

647
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:36,648
-I'll come every single day.
-All day, every day.

648
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:39,788
Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

649
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:41,706
And when we make a commitment
to a student,

650
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,206
we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

651
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:45,331
Can you do that?

652
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,333
Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

653
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,251
-And why is that?
-You don't know who I am?

654
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:53,416
No.

655
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:58,182
I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

656
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,507
Number one on that field

657
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,226
and number one
in your pretty little heart.

658
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:05,679
"The King of the Gridiron."

659
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,690
"Never-Say-No Joe?"

660
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:12,353
No? Nothing?

661
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,313
Odd.

662
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:18,784
-Well, don't you know who I am?
-No.

663
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,199
I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

664
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,704
the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

665
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,880
unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

666
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,708
That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

667
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:36,382
Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

668
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,672
She must be living under a rock.

669
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,130
-Raef. will take it this time.
-He shoots! Come on!

670
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:41,264
-Got it.
-Yeah!

671
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:43,552
I didn't see what happened
to Paul Pierce.

672
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:44,719
We'll be right back

673
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,851
-af.ter a word f.rom our...
-Let's go, Paul!

674
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:47,938
I can't believe they came from 10 down.

675
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:51,436
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

676
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,061
Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

677
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:57,449
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

678
00:43:57,577 --> 00:43:59,202
Let's get Webber.

679
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:09,585
Webber, you want a soda?

680
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:12,291
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

681
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,681
-That's refreshing.
-Good one.

682
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:25,271
What's up, Joe?

683
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,436
I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

684
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,557
I asked you to be careful!

685
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:33,108
-Which bathroom should I use?
-The one off the trophy room.

686
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,235
Come on, Pierce!

687
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:37,489
Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

688
00:44:37,617 --> 00:44:39,989
The man's a beast. You saw that, Joe.
You saw that.

689
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,780
That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

690
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:43,242
Celtics got this one locked up.

691
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:44,784
Hold on, hold on...

692
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,170
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.

693
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:57,257
Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

694
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:05,061
What did I do?

695
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:06,597
Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

696
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:09,815
-Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
-Three seconds left.

697
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,853
Welcome to
the Magical World of. Ponies.

698
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:15,186
What happened?

699
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:19,570
Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

700
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:20,817
Get the mechanicals!

701
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,159
The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

702
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,083
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

703
00:45:29,211 --> 00:45:30,835
It's right there. See?

704
00:45:30,963 --> 00:45:32,373
Unbelievable!

705
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:34,840
We missed it!

706
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:37,293
-You gotta celebrate.
-Peyton.

707
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,010
What did I do?

708
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,059
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

709
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:48,346
Wait. Where are you going?

710
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:51,597
You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

711
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:53,358
-I got to get home to...
-Where?

712
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:54,403
Nothing.

713
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:54,485
Nothing.

714
00:45:57,614 --> 00:45:59,608
What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

715
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:01,865
Bath. Bed. Now.

716
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:05,286
Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

717
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:08,583
Not too much. That's good.

718
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,456
Perfect.

719
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,250
This could take a while.

720
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:27,228
But what really sets
this f.uture Hall of. Famer apart...

721
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:28,931
Passion for the game.

722
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:32,516
Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

723
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,813
Spike!

724
00:46:34,945 --> 00:46:36,059
Spike?

725
00:46:36,947 --> 00:46:38,442
What happened?

726
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:40,945
Spike.

727
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:43,114
Peyton?

728
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,246
Peyton! Peyton!

729
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,039
Peyton!

730
00:47:15,987 --> 00:47:17,980
I'm not going to yell.

731
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:20,190
We're going to have a very calm

732
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,864
and rational discussion

733
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:26,780
about all...

734
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,369
You Bedazzled my football.

735
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:56,146
You guys comfortable? My pillow.

736
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:04,148
King on the couch!

737
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,536
This is ridiculous.

738
00:48:15,922 --> 00:48:17,666
Never

739
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,293
say...

740
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:22,295
No! No!

741
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,007
I have to warm up.

742
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:27,597
I have to practise.

743
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:33,811
I have a playoff game this weekend.

744
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,478
Do you...
Do you know what that means?

745
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:41,818
My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

746
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:47,695
My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

747
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:49,454
Is nothing sacred?

748
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,498
My towel! My towel.

749
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:58,710
This is all mine! It's all me!

750
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,925
It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

751
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,929
Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,
along with Boomer Esiason.

752
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:08,721
We're here in the Mile High City
where Denver hosts Boston

753
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:11,010
in the f.irst round of. the playof.f.s.

754
00:49:11,144 --> 00:49:13,054
In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

755
00:49:13,188 --> 00:49:15,431
We have a rematch
of. Iast year's Conf.erence Final

756
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:19,018
in which Denver narrowly escaped
with a 34-30 victory.

757
00:49:19,153 --> 00:49:21,692
He has the tight end screen,
he side-arms it.

758
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:23,614
The catch made by Cooper.

759
00:49:23,742 --> 00:49:26,362
Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.

760
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:29,867
And now, directing traf.f.ic...

761
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:32,750
Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!

762
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:34,875
And he's bounced out of. bounds!

763
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:36,746
Yeah! I did it again!

764
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:39,045
Oh, our boy looks great today.

765
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:41,380
He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

766
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:42,623
at the new Blake resort.

767
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,094
Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

768
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:47,844
Fanny.

769
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:53,764
Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

770
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:56,269
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

771
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,356
My mom says...

772
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:05,981
I mean, my dad says
your chilli cheese fries rock.

773
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:09,367
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

774
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:13,324
Kingman out of. the gun, takes a look.

775
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:17,206
He has Sanders wide open.
He's not going that way.

776
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:20,588
Marv, I've never seen a quarterback
who doesn't trust his wide receivers

777
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:22,092
with a game on the line like this.

778
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:24,126
Touchdown! It's all over!

779
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,420
Boston has def.eated Denver.

780
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:28,298
All on the legs of. Joe Kingman,

781
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,349
Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

782
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:32,509
for the second year in a row.

783
00:50:32,644 --> 00:50:35,480
Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

784
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:49,150
Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

785
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:52,371
I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

786
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:54,905
What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

787
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,583
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

788
00:50:57,461 --> 00:50:58,836
Hey, King.

789
00:50:58,963 --> 00:51:00,505
No, I'm the king. You're the king.

790
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:02,588
Don't do it, Elvis! Don't jump.

791
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:05,586
Mr Kingman?

792
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:08,554
Oh, no. Peyton.

793
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:10,971
Hey.

794
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:15,014
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

795
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:17,222
-Mr Kingman, we need to talk about...
-You know what?

796
00:51:17,356 --> 00:51:20,061
Why don't you just call me Joe?

797
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:22,934
Stop it. Stop it.

798
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,072
Mr Kingman,
I informed you from the start

799
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,523
that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare centre.

800
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,865
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

801
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:34,864
I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

802
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,036
Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

803
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:41,083
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.

804
00:51:42,757 --> 00:51:44,501
I just knew
you were one of those parents.

805
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,630
One of what parents?

806
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:52,891
The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

807
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:55,556
Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

808
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:57,478
All I know is I have an entire team...

809
00:51:57,606 --> 00:52:00,809
Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

810
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:03,184
Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

811
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,985
not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

812
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:09,487
-Listen, I care about Peyton.
-Then prove it!

813
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:12,074
-I got it.
-Hey, sweetie!

814
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:13,829
Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

815
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:17,407
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

816
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:20,293
And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

817
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,500
Cool.

818
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,759
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.

819
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:28,838
You're a freakishly large man

820
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:32,304
and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

821
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:34,923
No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

822
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,554
Not a ballerina.

823
00:52:36,938 --> 00:52:39,096
You do me a favour, mamita?
Can you please hold this for me?

824
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:40,262
Thank you so much.

825
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,483
Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

826
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,280
And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

827
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,233
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

828
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,110
I'm the only one that talks.

829
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:17,634
Up!

830
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:27,813
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.

831
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:29,442
Wasn't so bad.

832
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,827
We're just warming up, so come on.

833
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:51,213
Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

834
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:56,842
It wasn't... It wasn't so bad.

835
00:53:58,061 --> 00:54:00,387
You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

836
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:02,978
but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

837
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:05,184
And they hold and hold.

838
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,019
And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

839
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:12,690
So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

840
00:54:15,288 --> 00:54:17,742
Yeah. Right.

841
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,202
Yeah, right.

842
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:21,744
Listen, Mr Kingman,

843
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:24,581
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

844
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:27,668
She has passion, talent, discipline.

845
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:33,422
I guess she inherited more
than just your charm.

846
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:39,382
You see?

847
00:54:41,523 --> 00:54:43,108
Let's try that one again.

848
00:54:43,108 --> 00:54:43,224
Let's try that one again.

849
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:51,820
Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

850
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,360
Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

851
00:54:53,492 --> 00:54:55,532
I was doing some stuff.

852
00:54:55,954 --> 00:54:58,409
Well, you could've called.
You never call any more.

853
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,746
Dude, stop being such a chick.

854
00:55:02,918 --> 00:55:04,746
Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

855
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,085
You don't know the half of it.

856
00:55:15,347 --> 00:55:16,972
-Hello?
-Hi!

857
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:21,260
Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

858
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:23,016
I don't know where to start.

859
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:25,139
How about those pictures
you promised me?

860
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:26,983
E-mail me right now.

861
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,188
I have to see you.

862
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:29,601
Okay, hold on.

863
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:35,115
I just sent them.

864
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:36,780
You're breaking up. I love you.

865
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:39,485
Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

866
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:42,123
I love you, too.

867
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:48,579
We need to talk. Follow me.

868
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,637
I need my bed back.

869
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:04,728
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

870
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:10,070
Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

871
00:56:13,949 --> 00:56:15,443
It's beautiful.

872
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,820
-Thanks, Joe.
-You're welcome.

873
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:25,117
Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

874
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,494
No more buttonhooks in the kitchen.

875
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,338
Right. No more buttonhooks.

876
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:32,086
You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

877
00:56:32,217 --> 00:56:33,760
better than anybody.

878
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:38,967
But you and l,
you've been playing kid your entire life.

879
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:42,603
I just joined the dad team,
and I'm still learning all these plays.

880
00:56:42,728 --> 00:56:44,057
No kidding.

881
00:56:45,023 --> 00:56:46,813
All right.

882
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:49,610
Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

883
00:56:49,735 --> 00:56:52,273
and call an audible, okay? And...

884
00:56:54,364 --> 00:56:55,824
Here, this.

885
00:56:57,744 --> 00:57:00,780
When the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz

886
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:02,373
and all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

887
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:05,333
to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

888
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,121
He scores.

889
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:14,583
All right, it's kind of like, just like in life.

890
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:18,007
Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

891
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:20,423
Then you got to call an audible.

892
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:23,516
You got to learn on the go.

893
00:57:25,063 --> 00:57:28,099
-Just like us. Okay?
-Okay.

894
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:35,775
Number one on the f.ield,
and number one in your heart.

895
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:38,315
-Now, number one on your toothbrush.
-That's funny.

896
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:40,278
My teeth are really white.

897
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:42,576
Ding!

898
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,166
That's ridiculous.

899
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,581
No, that's not. That's awesome.

900
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:53,297
-Joe?
-Yeah?

901
00:57:55,344 --> 00:57:58,510
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

902
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:04,264
Well, l...

903
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:07,101
You have one incoming message.

904
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,599
Hold that question, all right?

905
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,186
This is the King. Do your thing.

906
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:19,985
Hey, baby, it's Tatianna.
I'm in Boston. I be there 6:00.

907
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,360
T atianna!

908
00:58:24,623 --> 00:58:28,407
T atianna's coming at 6:00.
I got plenty of time! It's 5:45!

909
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,295
Who's Tatianna?

910
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:33,708
I got 15 minutes.

911
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:38,173
-Who's Tatianna?
-5:45. 5:45. 5:45.

912
00:58:38,304 --> 00:58:41,175
Listen, she's a friend.
I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.

913
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:45,175
Take all this, take it down, and...
Hide it in your room.

914
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:46,342
And you go, too.

915
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,315
And you play hide-and-seek with that,
and just make sure they're all gone.

916
00:58:57,865 --> 00:58:59,989
Is Tatianna your girlfriend?

917
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:04,282
Do you mind?

918
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,170
No, no, no, no, maybe, yes.

919
00:59:21,097 --> 00:59:26,436
Hi, you must be Melanie.
Joe has told me so much about you!

920
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:30,309
-I'm Tatianna. What are you?
-Peyton. Joe's daughter.

921
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:32,304
Joe's daughter?

922
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,610
-How old are you anyway, four?
-How old are you, 40?

923
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,737
-I'm 21.
-Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?

924
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:41,864
Joe!

925
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:45,994
Bonsoir, Tatianna.
Baby, welcome back!

926
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:49,574
You look trés... Gorgeous!

927
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,378
-I know.
-I see you've already met...

928
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:57,414
Peyton.

929
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:00,552
Peyton, yes.
I don't know what she's told you.

930
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,838
'Cause she has
such a wild imagination.

931
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,342
Either way,
we have a lot to discuss over dinner.

932
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:07,722
Where are we eating?

933
01:00:07,853 --> 01:00:11,898
You are going to eat
over at the Jensens', across the hall.

934
01:00:12,023 --> 01:00:15,358
It's just like a restaurant over there.
Only not so much.

935
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:21,152
We going to miss you
at dinner tonight.

936
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:26,362
It was a shock at first,
but nothing's changed.

937
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,157
Nothing's changed.

938
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,829
Is your coat Bedazzled?

939
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:36,543
Peyton.

940
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:38,085
Wait a minute.

941
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:41,804
I'm still Joe.

942
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,969
Still the king.

943
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,425
You drive station wagon.

944
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:53,190
What? A station wagon?
That's not my car.

945
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,317
Somebody's fired.
I'm Joe Kingman and somebody's fired.

946
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,356
-Mr Kingman, wait! Mr Kingman.
-What?

947
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,909
I'm sorry, but I guess Peyton's
allergic to our dog.

948
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:09,655
Oh, she's allergic to the dog.
She's allergic to the dog.

949
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,364
Oh, really?
Well you're not allergic to Spike.

950
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,331
Excuse me.

951
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,791
-Bed. Now.
-I'm not even tired.

952
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,929
-Well, I am. Go to bed.
-To think you walked out on my mom

953
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,594
just to hang around
with the sorry likes of that.

954
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,469
What did you just say?

955
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:30,476
-To think you walked out...
-I didn't walk out on your mom.

956
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,099
She walked out on me.

957
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:33,641
Oh, really?

958
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,893
Because she said
you were self-centered. And selfish.

959
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,898
And that everything
always had to be about you.

960
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,690
She said your head was so swollen,

961
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:45,239
she was surprised
they made a helmet big enough to fit.

962
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,992
-She said that?
-And more.

963
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,115
You know, it's all coming back to me.

964
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,077
Of course. Everything.

965
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:58,664
All the talking and the arguing
and the complaining.

966
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,469
And you know what?
You're just like her!

967
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:02,672
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

968
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,547
You think you're right about everything!

969
01:02:04,681 --> 01:02:07,135
-Just like her!
-What else?

970
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,516
You scrunch your nose
when you get angry just like her!

971
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:11,759
Keep it coming.

972
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:15,728
You're always working on me
with those big brown eyes...

973
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,527
Well, I actually like that, it's really cute.

974
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,405
But it doesn't matter,
because it's just like her!

975
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,561
Is that all you got?

976
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:24,489
And then you get inside
people's minds,

977
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,409
and you drive them crazy!

978
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:27,650
Just like her!

979
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:32,746
Well, at least I got a mind,
because if I didn't, I'd be just like you!

980
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:37,086
Well, I'm lucky, because as far as
I'm concerned, you are nothing like me!

981
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:41,460
-Good! Because I am sick of it here.
-What do you want from me?

982
01:02:44,137 --> 01:02:47,637
Don't turn your back on me, little lady.
Tell me what you want!

983
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:48,963
My mom!

984
01:03:09,663 --> 01:03:11,454
Hey, open the door.

985
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:23,798
Thanks a lot, Spike.

986
01:03:23,927 --> 01:03:25,126
Traitor.

987
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:35,135
Any advice?

988
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:40,902
Are you lonesome tonight

989
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:45,570
Do you miss me tonight

990
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:53,157
Are you sorry we drif.ted apart

991
01:03:55,293 --> 01:04:00,038
Does your memory stray

992
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:04,170
To a bright sunny day

993
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:06,673
When I kissed you

994
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:11,467
and called you sweetheart

995
01:04:13,894 --> 01:04:18,806
I wonder why I am

996
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:23,271
Singing this f.or

997
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:27,817
When you will not even

998
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:32,610
Open the door

999
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,458
I don't want to see you.

1000
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:39,251
Well, how about you open the door
with your eyes closed?

1001
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,715
See, that wasn't so bad.

1002
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:51,010
Is your heart f.illed with pain

1003
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:56,679
Shall I come back again

1004
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:59,139
Tell me dear

1005
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:03,853
Are you lonesome tonight

1006
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:11,490
Won't you open your eyes

1007
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:16,365
Give your dad a surprise

1008
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,824
Tell me Peyton

1009
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:26,130
Are you lonesome tonight

1010
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:31,090
There they are. Big and brown.

1011
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:33,798
Do I really have my mommy's eyes?

1012
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,969
Yeah. You bet.

1013
01:05:37,105 --> 01:05:40,804
You also have
her crazy long eyelashes, too.

1014
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:45,648
And every time you bat those things,
there's a huge hurricane in Hawaii.

1015
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:50,318
See, look at that.
Three houses just blew away on Oahu.

1016
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:52,110
It's on the news.

1017
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:56,028
My mom said she fell in love with you
because of your guitar playing.

1018
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:58,621
That you sounded just like Elvis.

1019
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:01,456
-Well, what do you think?
-I think she was tone-deaf

1020
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:05,715
and you sound more like
a wounded moose than the King.

1021
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,878
A wounded moose?

1022
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,465
Like...

1023
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:12,963
Like that?

1024
01:06:14,226 --> 01:06:16,976
There's that smile
I've been waiting for.

1025
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:21,639
I would do anything to
keep that beautiful smile on your face.

1026
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,389
Anything?

1027
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,440
Quiet!

1028
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,731
Quiet! I said quiet!

1029
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:31,981
Let's go!

1030
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:35,282
Everybody, I need a tight formation,
right now, in front.

1031
01:06:35,414 --> 01:06:37,702
Tight formation, everybody.
Calling an audible.

1032
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,291
Fifty-nine razor. What would...

1033
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:42,288
I am serious! Everybody huddle up...

1034
01:06:43,297 --> 01:06:46,250
Little girls don't speak "football," Joe.

1035
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:47,960
Hey, I didn't say break.

1036
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:49,885
You call your dad Joe?

1037
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:53,804
Come here.
What am l, two feet tall? Peyton!

1038
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:59,300
Watch out!
Watch my legs, I got million-dollar legs.

1039
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,605
What's that number?

1040
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,559
Get out of here! You're in my way!

1041
01:07:03,693 --> 01:07:08,817
My legs! I got to play on Sunday.
Hello? I need help. I need help!

1042
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:13,277
Get off me! Everybody off...
Me first! Me first!

1043
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:18,871
-Excuse me.
-I'm world-famous. I'm a celebrity.

1044
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,547
Maybe a smidgen of the cream.

1045
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:36,548
Very good tea.
Would you like a little bit of tea?

1046
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:48,235
-Thank you for saving me.
-You're welcome.

1047
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,447
Totally out of my league.
Only mothers can do this stuff.

1048
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:53,690
Not necessarily.

1049
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:56,911
I mean, it's true
that mothers are definitely smarter

1050
01:07:57,038 --> 01:07:58,947
and kinder and funnier,

1051
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:02,617
and for the most part
better at everything.

1052
01:08:02,753 --> 01:08:03,867
But can I tell you something?

1053
01:08:04,003 --> 01:08:06,920
I wouldn't underestimate
the power of the father.

1054
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,920
-The power of the father.
-Sure.

1055
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,385
Dads are great for picking you up
and dusting you off.

1056
01:08:13,512 --> 01:08:14,793
They give you the courage to do things

1057
01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:16,841
that you never thought you could.

1058
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:19,761
My father took me
to my first ballet class.

1059
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,270
Lucky for us he did.

1060
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,270
What?

1061
01:08:32,448 --> 01:08:33,729
Nothing.

1062
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:35,944
Do we have any product for this?

1063
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,948
My doll has hair plugs for some reason.

1064
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:42,663
Joe, they've got Camille
fingernail polish!

1065
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:44,453
-No way.
-Way!

1066
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:49,542
Nice shade. What is that?
Powder-puff pink?

1067
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:52,881
I got a question. Do your toes match?

1068
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:57,591
Hey. Hey, relax. Relax. Cut it out.
He can't help it.

1069
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:00,801
Somebody stole his man card.

1070
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:05,476
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Listen up.

1071
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:09,653
Indianapolis claims that they're
going to send us on a long vacation.

1072
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,150
-But who's about to go fishing?
-They are!

1073
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,274
-Who's about to hit the links?
-They are!

1074
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:17,493
-Who's going to win the championship?
-They are!

1075
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:21,237
-We are?
-We are!

1076
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:22,832
-Ready!
-Break!

1077
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,719
Your turn, little one.

1078
01:09:49,234 --> 01:09:54,859
I can't do it. I'm not big enough.
My shoulders aren't strong enough.

1079
01:09:55,908 --> 01:10:00,737
Little one. You can do it.
Your strength is in here.

1080
01:10:01,747 --> 01:10:03,207
-Are you ready?
-Okay.

1081
01:10:03,582 --> 01:10:04,828
Let's do it.

1082
01:10:10,716 --> 01:10:13,586
-There you go. You're doing it.
-Yeah, it's moving.

1083
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:14,832
Hey, Joe.

1084
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:17,555
Attaway, P.

1085
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:24,645
And one. Higher.
Point those toes, please.

1086
01:10:24,938 --> 01:10:27,725
Everybody together. Much better.

1087
01:10:28,442 --> 01:10:30,149
No, no, no, no, no, no...

1088
01:10:31,987 --> 01:10:32,983
Instinct.

1089
01:10:35,323 --> 01:10:36,734
And a three. And one...

1090
01:10:36,867 --> 01:10:37,898
And...

1091
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:42,069
Hey. You've got my time, cutie-pie.
Yeah...

1092
01:10:51,673 --> 01:10:55,422
Boston Rebels. Catch the spirit.

1093
01:10:58,139 --> 01:11:00,807
Hey, Peyton. Come here.
You are so busted! Get over here!

1094
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,220
-Hey...
-Get him!

1095
01:11:04,353 --> 01:11:05,431
Fire!

1096
01:11:05,563 --> 01:11:07,021
-Fire!
-Fire!

1097
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:17,979
Good one.

1098
01:11:58,242 --> 01:12:00,033
Boston beats lndianapolis.

1099
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,912
The Rebels will advance on
to next Sunday's conference finals...

1100
01:12:03,037 --> 01:12:06,453
Look at this. Look at this.
Artwork in the locker, huh?

1101
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:10,498
I definitely say
she's breached the final frontier.

1102
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:11,873
That's our game plan.

1103
01:12:12,006 --> 01:12:14,081
See, I especially like the Xs and Os
down there.

1104
01:12:14,216 --> 01:12:16,541
Oh, no, those are hugs and kisses.

1105
01:12:16,676 --> 01:12:20,591
Hugs and kisses. All right. All right.

1106
01:12:24,851 --> 01:12:26,809
Is Spike wearing a tutu?

1107
01:12:28,063 --> 01:12:29,521
No, no.

1108
01:12:29,814 --> 01:12:34,478
No, that's one of those...
That's one of those doggy supports.

1109
01:12:38,407 --> 01:12:40,779
Hey, P. P! Hey, P.

1110
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:43,578
Give these to Monique, okay?
There she is.

1111
01:12:43,703 --> 01:12:44,734
You good?

1112
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:46,989
Miss Monique. These are for you.

1113
01:12:50,795 --> 01:12:52,502
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1114
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,002
-Are you ready for your big debut?
-Yeah.

1115
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:56,412
-There you go, P.
-Thank you.

1116
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:59,220
No, no, no. Joe. Joe, this is for you.

1117
01:13:05,143 --> 01:13:08,261
No. No, in case you forgot,
I'm a "freakishly" large man

1118
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:10,389
and these are "freakishly" small tights.

1119
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:12,930
Hurry up, offence. No huddle.

1120
01:13:13,068 --> 01:13:14,443
-Hey, guys.
-Let's go.

1121
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:16,645
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1122
01:13:16,779 --> 01:13:20,693
-Please. Get dressed.
-No, listen to me. There's no...

1123
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,159
How's it going?

1124
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:29,488
Full house.

1125
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,585
-Oh, no.
-Hey.

1126
01:13:32,295 --> 01:13:35,795
You know, Joe, I'm not feeling so good.

1127
01:13:35,923 --> 01:13:39,375
We should just go home.
Yeah, let's go home.

1128
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:43,639
Did I just hear the girl who forced me
to learn pirouettes give up?

1129
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:47,135
But I didn't think there were
going to be so many people.

1130
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:49,725
You just have pre-game jitters,
that's all.

1131
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:51,764
All athletes have those.

1132
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:55,311
-Even me.
-You do?

1133
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:58,650
Come here, honey. Stand up.

1134
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,409
We've worked way too hard
to quit now.

1135
01:14:03,534 --> 01:14:04,815
I know.

1136
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,454
All right, all right. All right.

1137
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:19,460
Listen, I don't care how ridiculous
either of us looks out there, okay?

1138
01:14:19,592 --> 01:14:23,257
We're going to go out on the stage,
and we're going to dance our tutus off.

1139
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:26,390
-Because my daughter's no quitter.
-No, she's not.

1140
01:14:26,516 --> 01:14:28,426
And she never says no.

1141
01:14:30,395 --> 01:14:31,391
Okay.

1142
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:36,475
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen Joe Kingman?

1143
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:40,572
Oh. Wait, no wait.

1144
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,314
That is the stupidest outfit
I've ever seen.

1145
01:14:44,452 --> 01:14:47,654
Stupid is a mean word, Mr Cooper.

1146
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:51,952
I didn't say "stupid." I said "stupidest."
Look it up.

1147
01:14:52,085 --> 01:14:54,492
Hey, Sanders.
What are you guys doing here?

1148
01:14:54,628 --> 01:14:56,704
What are we doing here?

1149
01:14:56,838 --> 01:15:00,421
Joe, did you really think the team
was going to miss this?

1150
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:05,470
Yeah, you should've said no, Joe.
You should've said no.

1151
01:15:06,056 --> 01:15:07,716
Did you say "team"?

1152
01:15:11,311 --> 01:15:12,556
Joe.

1153
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,685
-P.
-Monroe.

1154
01:15:16,818 --> 01:15:17,849
Bye.

1155
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:20,144
Did you say "team"? Or...

1156
01:15:26,744 --> 01:15:28,572
Don't panic. No panic.

1157
01:15:29,247 --> 01:15:31,536
Power of the father.
Power of the father.

1158
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:32,746
Power of the... You're panicking.

1159
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:55,614
-Wow.
-Look at that one.

1160
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,646
Wow. That's incredible.

1161
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:27,881
So

1162
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:29,930
beautiful.

1163
01:18:33,225 --> 01:18:35,016
-Bravo! Bravo!
-Bravo! Bravo!

1164
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:44,940
Little one!

1165
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:01,408
Well, Boomer,
af.ter their impressive victory today

1166
01:19:01,546 --> 01:19:04,332
Joe Kingman and all of. Boston
will f.inally get the chance

1167
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:08,131
at that coveted trophy, which has
eluded them f.or all these years.

1168
01:19:08,261 --> 01:19:10,716
Aw, there's my number-one
quarterback.

1169
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,804
We did it! We're going!

1170
01:19:12,932 --> 01:19:14,676
You may be the world's
greatest football player,

1171
01:19:14,809 --> 01:19:16,351
but I'm the world's greatest agent.

1172
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:17,640
What's up?

1173
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:19,514
We're about to make
Tiger's endorsements

1174
01:19:19,646 --> 01:19:21,688
Iook like minimum wage.

1175
01:19:21,817 --> 01:19:25,979
All you have to do is,
A, win the championship game...

1176
01:19:26,113 --> 01:19:27,108
Details.

1177
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:30,939
B, right after you win,
look straight into the camera

1178
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:34,444
and say,
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers."

1179
01:19:34,954 --> 01:19:39,451
-That's it. An instant 25 million.
-Hamburger.

1180
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:44,494
Stella, for the record, Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

1181
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:47,835
Zip it before I tie another one of
those things around your mouth.

1182
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,926
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers."

1183
01:19:50,512 --> 01:19:52,719
Twenty-five million. Done.

1184
01:19:55,016 --> 01:19:57,509
I'm going to Fanny's Burgers.

1185
01:19:57,645 --> 01:20:00,895
...two and one to the front. Get ready...

1186
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:04,471
Spike, what are you doing?

1187
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:09,150
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, guys. I didn't...

1188
01:20:11,408 --> 01:20:17,032
"Please be our lunch date.
X-O-X-O, Peyton and Joe."

1189
01:20:18,582 --> 01:20:20,289
-Hi!
-Hey!

1190
01:20:20,876 --> 01:20:23,034
Okay. Thank you.

1191
01:20:23,421 --> 01:20:25,329
-You were freakishly large.
-I agree.

1192
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:27,917
No, I'm not. Don't say that.

1193
01:20:28,676 --> 01:20:30,384
-You guys good?
-There's the guy right there.

1194
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:31,506
What did I tell you?

1195
01:20:31,636 --> 01:20:33,381
I agree that you are freakishly large.

1196
01:20:33,514 --> 01:20:34,890
That's not funny.

1197
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,641
Hey, Joe! Joe, man!

1198
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,551
Number one.

1199
01:20:39,686 --> 01:20:41,975
-Joe, Joe, Joe...
-Joe, Joe, Joe...

1200
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:43,814
-ls it always like this?
-Nah.

1201
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,565
What, you have a big game
coming up?

1202
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:48,399
-Yeah, the championship.
-That's exciting.

1203
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:51,364
Eight years old and already going to
big events like that, huh? I like it.

1204
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:54,694
Yeah, unfortunately Peyton's
going to be home by then.

1205
01:20:54,828 --> 01:20:56,867
Her mom gets back from Africa
in a few days.

1206
01:20:56,996 --> 01:20:58,489
Well, can't you just go home
after the game?

1207
01:20:58,622 --> 01:21:02,074
No, I have to get back before she does.

1208
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,835
What did you say?

1209
01:21:05,296 --> 01:21:08,250
You said you'd have to get back
before she does?

1210
01:21:08,382 --> 01:21:09,793
Isn't your mom picking you up?

1211
01:21:09,926 --> 01:21:12,927
-Well...
-Peyton.

1212
01:21:13,055 --> 01:21:16,340
I was planning to tell you, Joe.
I really was, but...

1213
01:21:16,475 --> 01:21:19,429
Actually, it's a really funny story.
You're going to love it.

1214
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,802
-It's just LOL...
-Quit stalling.

1215
01:21:21,938 --> 01:21:24,939
I'm supposed to be studying at a
special ballet programme this month

1216
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,557
but instead,
I snuck away to come meet you.

1217
01:21:28,987 --> 01:21:30,445
You ran away?

1218
01:21:31,989 --> 01:21:33,400
You ran away?

1219
01:21:33,824 --> 01:21:36,863
-Yummy dessert.
-ls your mom even in Africa?

1220
01:21:36,996 --> 01:21:39,617
-About that...
-What have you done?

1221
01:21:39,748 --> 01:21:42,536
Okay, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation and everybody...

1222
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,458
The press is going to eat me alive.

1223
01:21:44,586 --> 01:21:48,121
What a stupid, stupid, stupid thing
for you to do.

1224
01:21:48,256 --> 01:21:50,962
Did you ever stop and think about
how this was going to impact me?

1225
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:52,801
Oh, stop it.
That's not going to work this time.

1226
01:21:52,929 --> 01:21:53,960
You're in serious trouble.

1227
01:21:54,095 --> 01:21:56,587
Okay, she's sweating like crazy.
She's coughing. Her lips are swelling.

1228
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:59,475
Oh, come on. Don't fall for that.
She's a little world-class performer.

1229
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,927
I don't think she's acting right now.
Give me one second.

1230
01:22:02,063 --> 01:22:04,636
-Are you allergic to something?
-Nuts.

1231
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:06,434
Did you know that?

1232
01:22:06,567 --> 01:22:10,065
The dessert has nuts.
Take her to the hospital. Come on.

1233
01:22:11,404 --> 01:22:12,685
Hospital. Where's the nearest hospital?

1234
01:22:12,823 --> 01:22:14,981
Ninth and Woodrow. I'll get the car.

1235
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:17,614
Where you going?
What are you doing?

1236
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:21,404
Move, move! Move!

1237
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:22,820
Excuse me, sir.

1238
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:40,091
Help! My daughter needs help! Help!

1239
01:22:40,226 --> 01:22:42,717
-What do we got here?
-Help. She's allergic.

1240
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:45,605
She can't breathe.
She's allergic to nuts.

1241
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:48,733
Looks like an anaphylactic reaction.
Set her down.

1242
01:22:48,859 --> 01:22:52,525
-She can't breathe.
-Baby. Baby, open up your mouth.

1243
01:22:52,655 --> 01:22:54,363
Airway's almost closed. Let's move her.

1244
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,360
-Ten litres non-rebreather mask.
-Peyton. Peyton.

1245
01:22:58,161 --> 01:22:59,536
I'll show you to the family waiting room.

1246
01:22:59,662 --> 01:23:01,488
It's going to be fine.
They're going to take good care of her.

1247
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:02,868
She'll be okay.

1248
01:23:05,668 --> 01:23:07,460
Peyton Kelly's father?

1249
01:23:11,925 --> 01:23:12,956
I'm Peyton's dad.

1250
01:23:13,092 --> 01:23:15,667
Your daughter is responding well
to the treatment.

1251
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:17,844
We're going to keep her overnight
just to be sure,

1252
01:23:17,972 --> 01:23:19,716
but she's going to be fine.

1253
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:25,438
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-You were really, really lucky this time.

1254
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,890
-She's going to be all right.
-Yeah.

1255
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:33,689
Okay.

1256
01:23:36,824 --> 01:23:39,113
Please tell me Peyton's all right.

1257
01:23:39,243 --> 01:23:40,988
She's going to be...

1258
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,663
She's going to be fine. The doctor says
that she's going to be fine.

1259
01:23:48,295 --> 01:23:51,130
You're lucky I haven't called the police.

1260
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:54,418
-Karen?
-I got home early,

1261
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,011
and I see you and Peyton.

1262
01:23:56,136 --> 01:23:59,636
Your faces plastered
on the front of every magazine.

1263
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:02,636
I called Peyton a hundred times
yesterday. She didn't answer.

1264
01:24:02,768 --> 01:24:07,395
I flew out here, got off the plane,
and I see all of this on the news.

1265
01:24:08,274 --> 01:24:09,305
Karen?

1266
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:12,692
Is that all you can say for yourself,
is "Karen"?

1267
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:17,862
-l... I thought you were dead.
-I can assure you, I'm not dead.

1268
01:24:20,744 --> 01:24:24,279
-How did you find her?
-I didn't. She found me.

1269
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:29,418
Wait a minute.
Is Peyton's mom still in Africa?

1270
01:24:36,802 --> 01:24:39,009
She didn't tell you, did she?

1271
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:42,887
Joe,

1272
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:48,349
Sara died in a car accident
six months ago.

1273
01:24:59,243 --> 01:25:00,487
Oh, Peyton.

1274
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:18,802
So when we got to Boston,
I put you into the car service.

1275
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:23,844
I sort of e-mailed
and changed the drop-off location.

1276
01:25:23,975 --> 01:25:26,596
The driver took me to Joe's.

1277
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:29,563
Where does everybody
at your ballet school think you are?

1278
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:31,729
In Africa with you.

1279
01:25:33,944 --> 01:25:36,565
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

1280
01:25:37,614 --> 01:25:40,532
But we're going to discuss
everything else when we get home.

1281
01:25:40,658 --> 01:25:42,485
-Home?
-Yes.

1282
01:25:42,618 --> 01:25:45,739
As soon as Peyton's strong enough,
we're going to go home.

1283
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:48,707
Hold on a sec. You can't come in here
and think she's going to go home...

1284
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:51,918
You know what? We're going
to discuss the travel plans a little later.

1285
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,750
Right now,
Peyton needs to get some rest.

1286
01:25:58,761 --> 01:26:00,753
I'm telling you.
It's terrible timing.

1287
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:02,547
It's absolutely terrible timing.
With the...

1288
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:04,140
I'm gonna go
get everybody some coffee.

1289
01:26:04,266 --> 01:26:08,015
-Do you want some coffee?
-Double non-fat latte.

1290
01:26:08,145 --> 01:26:09,972
Okay. Okay.

1291
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,078
Forget about timing.
I don't care about the game.

1292
01:26:32,212 --> 01:26:33,789
I just care about her.

1293
01:26:34,338 --> 01:26:38,502
All right. I understand.
But if you could just leave it to...

1294
01:26:38,635 --> 01:26:40,426
-Can we talk?
-Yeah.

1295
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:46,305
She's asleep. It's okay.

1296
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:53,686
Here.

1297
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:57,153
We're all good.

1298
01:26:59,405 --> 01:27:01,529
Are you saying you want Peyton
to live here with you?

1299
01:27:01,658 --> 01:27:05,158
-Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
-You haven't even been in her life.

1300
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:08,371
That's not my fault.
I didn't even know she existed!

1301
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:09,957
And we've come such a long way
in a short time.

1302
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:13,037
What, you mean since a month ago
when you left her in a bar?

1303
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,043
I am not the same man that I was.

1304
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:18,172
Or an hour ago
when she almost died on your watch?

1305
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:21,592
This is not about you.

1306
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,469
This is about Peyton,
what's best for her.

1307
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,342
And she needs to be in a stable home

1308
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,268
with someone who's known her
her whole life.

1309
01:27:29,395 --> 01:27:32,764
Peyton needs her father.
She needs me.

1310
01:27:32,898 --> 01:27:35,685
Of course. It'll be a huge distraction.

1311
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:41,152
And ugly.
Child custody fights always are.

1312
01:27:43,617 --> 01:27:47,746
Joe will be dragged through the mud.
His endorsements torpedoed.

1313
01:27:47,997 --> 01:27:50,570
He's worked too hard
to have it end like this.

1314
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:52,831
I just don't see him
getting through this.

1315
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,036
My hard work goes down the drain.

1316
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:57,542
This is exactly the sort of thing
that could end his career.

1317
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:01,256
That's not your decision to make.
Sara appointed me her guardian.

1318
01:28:01,386 --> 01:28:05,881
I missed eight years of Peyton's life.
And I'm not going to miss any more.

1319
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,302
And I will fight for this.

1320
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:10,885
Oh, that would be a great thing
to put her through, don't you think?

1321
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,226
Do you have any idea
how to take care of a child?

1322
01:28:13,356 --> 01:28:15,978
I've been doing it for a month now!

1323
01:28:16,109 --> 01:28:18,564
And look where we're standing, Joe.

1324
01:28:27,746 --> 01:28:31,280
Hey, P, you're awake.

1325
01:28:33,626 --> 01:28:36,034
-How you feeling?
-I'm okay.

1326
01:28:37,422 --> 01:28:39,795
-I want to go home.
-Okay.

1327
01:28:42,636 --> 01:28:45,590
No problem. Doctor said
you could come home tomorrow.

1328
01:28:45,721 --> 01:28:47,465
Then we can go home.

1329
01:28:47,599 --> 01:28:52,177
I want to go home now
with Aunt Karen.

1330
01:28:55,231 --> 01:29:00,143
P, if it's...
If it's what I said at the restaurant,

1331
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:02,520
honey, I didn't mean that.

1332
01:29:02,657 --> 01:29:05,775
I just want to go home with Aunt Karen.

1333
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:07,984
I never should've come here.

1334
01:29:28,349 --> 01:29:30,305
Take care of her, will you?

1335
01:29:30,435 --> 01:29:32,971
Hey, you know who
lives in this building?

1336
01:29:33,104 --> 01:29:35,974
Joe Kingman, the quarterback.
How about that, huh?

1337
01:29:55,918 --> 01:29:57,496
Come on, Spike.

1338
01:29:58,378 --> 01:29:59,375
Spike.

1339
01:30:03,135 --> 01:30:05,672
Spike, not tonight. Come on, Spike.

1340
01:30:06,555 --> 01:30:10,172
Spike, there's nothing under there.
She's gone. Come on.

1341
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:13,016
Is that her bag?

1342
01:30:42,341 --> 01:30:45,211
"What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?"

1343
01:31:27,177 --> 01:31:31,923
"Dear Joe, I have written
this letter a thousand times

1344
01:31:32,057 --> 01:31:34,430
"but I could never find the right words.

1345
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,103
-"We have a daughter."
-We have a daughter.

1346
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:38,055
-Her name is Peyton.
-"Her name is Peyton."

1347
01:31:38,189 --> 01:31:43,396
She's like you in so many ways,
athletic, headstrong...

1348
01:31:45,738 --> 01:31:49,521
Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.
Leave us a message. Bye.

1349
01:31:51,243 --> 01:31:56,452
I'm so af.raid you'll be angry with me
and not want anything to do with her.

1350
01:31:56,582 --> 01:32:00,331
We had already decided
to go our separate ways.

1351
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:05,122
I rationalised that I was doing
the right thing in keeping her f.rom you.

1352
01:32:05,257 --> 01:32:08,425
You were just starting out
in your career.

1353
01:32:08,554 --> 01:32:11,470
A child would have been
such a distraction.

1354
01:32:18,646 --> 01:32:19,927
Idiot.

1355
01:32:22,693 --> 01:32:26,061
He's open, Joe. Sanders is wide open.

1356
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:44,000
Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.
Leave us a message. Bye.

1357
01:32:44,506 --> 01:32:47,591
Hey, just calling to say that...

1358
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:54,338
Spike, he misses you and...

1359
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:59,010
I mean, Spike really misses you, he...

1360
01:33:02,733 --> 01:33:05,189
Sounds like someone else
misses her, too.

1361
01:33:07,404 --> 01:33:08,983
Oh, hey.

1362
01:33:09,114 --> 01:33:11,190
Sanders, I was just...

1363
01:33:11,324 --> 01:33:12,984
I was talking to...

1364
01:33:15,997 --> 01:33:18,487
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

1365
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:21,993
Well, the only thing you can do

1366
01:33:22,127 --> 01:33:25,046
is make sure
that she knows you love her

1367
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:28,042
and that nothing's
ever going to change that.

1368
01:33:28,176 --> 01:33:31,378
And then when she's ready,
she'll find you again.

1369
01:33:32,972 --> 01:33:36,091
-You know, I owe you a big "thank you."
-Oh yeah? For what?

1370
01:33:36,225 --> 01:33:39,890
Just for catching everything
I've thrown at you all these years.

1371
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:42,813
That's what friends are for.

1372
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:50,984
Hey, old man.
Are we ready to win the big game?

1373
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:53,653
Hold on a second, Joe.
Can we have a word with you?

1374
01:33:53,784 --> 01:33:56,537
Word has it that your daughter
is no longer staying with you.

1375
01:33:56,663 --> 01:33:59,332
How much easier will it be for you
to focus on football

1376
01:33:59,457 --> 01:34:01,615
without the distraction
of an eight-year-old?

1377
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:04,752
She's not a distraction.
She's my daughter.

1378
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:05,911
I'd want her here with me

1379
01:34:06,046 --> 01:34:10,127
even if. it meant I'd never play
another f.ootball game again.

1380
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:14,175
There's nothing that I love more
than my daughter.

1381
01:34:14,305 --> 01:34:15,503
Nothing.

1382
01:34:39,582 --> 01:34:42,914
Here we are as the two biggest rivals
in f.ootball square of.f.

1383
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:46,377
f.or their chance
to etch their names in sports history.

1384
01:34:46,506 --> 01:34:47,963
You know,
and I think the question today, Marv,

1385
01:34:48,091 --> 01:34:50,795
is will Joe Kingman
f.inally get a chance at glory?

1386
01:34:50,926 --> 01:34:54,176
Or will New York win their third title
in the last f.our years?

1387
01:34:54,305 --> 01:34:55,300
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go, Joe.

1388
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:57,554
Third and long f.or the Rebels.

1389
01:34:57,682 --> 01:35:00,519
Here's Kingman... Back to throw.

1390
01:35:00,645 --> 01:35:03,182
Oh, he's drilled
by the linebacker, Drake.

1391
01:35:03,314 --> 01:35:05,721
New York has recovered the f.umble.

1392
01:35:06,859 --> 01:35:09,184
Boomer,
Kingman is way of.f. his game today.

1393
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:11,029
This is not the same Boston team

1394
01:35:11,155 --> 01:35:12,863
we've seen march through
the playof.f.s.

1395
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,319
You know Marv, I can't explain this.

1396
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:16,573
I mean,
he's missing wide-open receivers.

1397
01:35:16,703 --> 01:35:20,202
He's been sacked f.our times, and he
looks like he's distracted to me.

1398
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:23,001
So whatever that distraction is,
he's got to put it aside.

1399
01:35:23,126 --> 01:35:25,795
He owes it to his teammates
and the f.ans of. the Boston team

1400
01:35:25,921 --> 01:35:27,082
to play it and lay it on the line.

1401
01:35:27,212 --> 01:35:29,420
Your guy's not looking so hot.

1402
01:35:30,382 --> 01:35:34,511
How long has it been since you've had
one of your own Fanny's burgers?

1403
01:35:38,809 --> 01:35:40,515
Too long, is my guess.

1404
01:35:44,314 --> 01:35:47,518
Deflects right lead, speed left squirrel.
On one. Ready?

1405
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,229
The Rebels trailing seven-three.

1406
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,396
Less than a minute remaining
in the f.irst half..

1407
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:54,108
Kingman has his team at the line.

1408
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,823
Cooper, wide right,
shif.ts back to tight end.

1409
01:35:58,036 --> 01:36:00,953
Signal's called, and here's Kingman.

1410
01:36:01,081 --> 01:36:02,409
Yes, go!

1411
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:04,201
Kingman on the run.

1412
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,993
He is crushed.

1413
01:36:07,546 --> 01:36:08,625
"Crushed" is right, Marv.

1414
01:36:08,755 --> 01:36:12,088
Drake, the linebacker f.or New York,
is having a whale of. a f.ootball game.

1415
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:14,756
They are on a mission
to shut Kingman up.

1416
01:36:14,886 --> 01:36:17,259
Welcome to the championship game,
Kingman.

1417
01:36:19,182 --> 01:36:21,637
Who's the king now, Joe? I am!

1418
01:36:21,768 --> 01:36:23,560
Come on, Joe! Get up, Joe!

1419
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,939
-Yeah, baby! Let's go!
-Get Danville.

1420
01:36:27,065 --> 01:36:29,686
Hold on f.or a second, Marv.
Joe Kingman is still down.

1421
01:36:29,819 --> 01:36:31,692
It looks like he was hit by a truck.

1422
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:33,100
Believe me, I know. I've been there.

1423
01:36:33,238 --> 01:36:35,360
This hit is not going to be easy
to come back from.

1424
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:38,610
So, Boomer, you never want to
speculate as to the extent of. the injury.

1425
01:36:38,744 --> 01:36:40,368
They're being very caref.ul,
as you can see,

1426
01:36:40,496 --> 01:36:42,820
Iif.ting Joe Kingman onto that gurney.

1427
01:36:42,957 --> 01:36:44,581
Well, they really can't evaluate him
on the f.ield.

1428
01:36:44,707 --> 01:36:46,167
They want to do that
in the locker room.

1429
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:48,119
Some way, Joe Kingman
is going to have to f.ind a way

1430
01:36:48,252 --> 01:36:49,286
to get back on this f.ield.

1431
01:36:49,421 --> 01:36:52,625
-Don't worry, he's tough.
-He better be.

1432
01:36:52,925 --> 01:36:56,127
Oh, he is. Tough as nails.

1433
01:36:56,429 --> 01:36:59,298
And there's the backup quarterback,
Danville, taking the knee,

1434
01:36:59,431 --> 01:37:01,091
so that does it f.or the f.irst half..

1435
01:37:01,225 --> 01:37:02,305
This is not good f.or the Rebels.

1436
01:37:02,435 --> 01:37:05,435
They have got to hope that Kingman
can f.ind the strength to come back.

1437
01:37:05,563 --> 01:37:07,555
-All right, what's going on here?
-lt doesn't look good, Coach.

1438
01:37:07,689 --> 01:37:11,024
He's got a separated shoulder,
bruised ribs. I think he's done.

1439
01:37:11,152 --> 01:37:12,811
Joe, it's your call.

1440
01:37:12,944 --> 01:37:16,029
If you think you can handle it, then...

1441
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:17,485
What do you say?

1442
01:37:27,793 --> 01:37:29,418
Put Danville in.

1443
01:37:30,212 --> 01:37:32,336
That's the best thing for the team.

1444
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:34,545
Can you believe this?

1445
01:37:34,676 --> 01:37:38,009
It looks like Danville, the backup
quarterback, is checking in.

1446
01:37:38,136 --> 01:37:39,418
He hasn't played all season.

1447
01:37:39,555 --> 01:37:42,094
Can you say,
"Nightmare scenario for Boston"?

1448
01:37:42,225 --> 01:37:45,310
He's coming back out, right?
You know how important this deal is.

1449
01:37:45,436 --> 01:37:50,347
Sam, baby. Not to worry.
Our Joe's not a quitter.

1450
01:38:00,952 --> 01:38:02,197
Go, Boston.

1451
01:38:03,788 --> 01:38:06,541
So, it's all in the hands
of. the backup quarterback, Danville.

1452
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:10,000
And he's in trouble,
and down he goes.

1453
01:38:10,128 --> 01:38:12,086
Joe Kingman must be banged up
pretty bad.

1454
01:38:12,213 --> 01:38:13,588
If. not, he would never let Maddox

1455
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:15,292
take him out
of. the championship game.

1456
01:38:17,595 --> 01:38:19,219
Turn them off.

1457
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,051
I said turn them off!

1458
01:38:23,182 --> 01:38:26,717
Hey, Joe. You got money
on New York or something?

1459
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:32,806
Peyton? Come here.

1460
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:37,238
It's okay.

1461
01:38:39,115 --> 01:38:40,777
Please tell me
you're not on the lam again.

1462
01:38:40,909 --> 01:38:43,662
No, this time she brought the warden
with her.

1463
01:38:44,872 --> 01:38:48,074
-What are you guys doing here?
-I called an audible.

1464
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,747
See, I thought you'd be better off
without me.

1465
01:38:52,631 --> 01:38:57,707
But judging by the butt-whupping
you got out there, I guess I was wrong.

1466
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:03,515
I love you, Daddy.
I want to come home.

1467
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:07,224
I love you too, Peyton.
I love you so much.

1468
01:39:09,104 --> 01:39:11,014
She needs her father.

1469
01:39:12,192 --> 01:39:13,935
She needs you, Joe.

1470
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,613
Are you serious?

1471
01:39:20,826 --> 01:39:22,403
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1472
01:39:22,536 --> 01:39:24,029
-Yeah.
-Come here!

1473
01:39:25,622 --> 01:39:28,457
-Daddy, can't breathe.
-Joe, can't breathe.

1474
01:39:28,582 --> 01:39:29,828
Me either.

1475
01:39:31,211 --> 01:39:33,618
So, why aren't you out there playing?

1476
01:39:33,755 --> 01:39:35,628
I thought the team
would be better off without me.

1477
01:39:35,756 --> 01:39:39,837
I didn't come all this way
to see my dad sit out the big game.

1478
01:39:39,969 --> 01:39:41,628
I'm really banged up, P.

1479
01:39:41,762 --> 01:39:43,886
Did I just hear the King give up?

1480
01:39:44,432 --> 01:39:48,132
We've worked way too hard
for you to throw in the towel now.

1481
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:52,432
My dad's not a quitter.
And he never says no.

1482
01:40:09,542 --> 01:40:11,913
I have an answer to your question, P.

1483
01:40:12,336 --> 01:40:14,162
Win or lose today,

1484
01:40:14,296 --> 01:40:17,416
you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1485
01:40:40,864 --> 01:40:44,613
Marv, what is this? There's some
sort of. commotion down by the tunnel.

1486
01:40:46,121 --> 01:40:47,319
Time! Time!

1487
01:40:47,497 --> 01:40:51,280
And it's Joe Kingman. He's come out!

1488
01:40:51,417 --> 01:40:53,207
What a moment f.or Kingman,
his teammates,

1489
01:40:53,336 --> 01:40:55,375
and certainly Boston's f.ans.

1490
01:40:55,503 --> 01:40:59,039
-Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
-Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

1491
01:40:59,216 --> 01:41:02,217
All right. All right. Coach, your call.

1492
01:41:04,346 --> 01:41:05,721
Your team.

1493
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:10,010
All right. Train red two.
Fifty win pass zebra. All right?

1494
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:14,764
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Nobody look
at the clock! Look at me! Look at me!

1495
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:16,725
We got plenty of time,
and I'm going to tell you why.

1496
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:20,810
You know why?
Because the Rebels never say "no."

1497
01:41:20,948 --> 01:41:21,944
Break!

1498
01:41:23,367 --> 01:41:25,275
Come on, Joe! Destroy them!

1499
01:41:26,036 --> 01:41:28,905
With only a minute remaining,
Kingman would have to put together

1500
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:30,581
the drive of the century.

1501
01:41:30,707 --> 01:41:34,123
He'll have to march
the Rebels 65 yards.

1502
01:41:34,252 --> 01:41:36,541
Boomer, he has no timeouts remaining

1503
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:39,244
and they need
a touchdown f.or the win.

1504
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:42,087
Down set!

1505
01:41:42,219 --> 01:41:44,710
All right,
Kingman makes changes at the line.

1506
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,556
Go Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1507
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,590
Back 88.

1508
01:41:52,145 --> 01:41:53,889
Back 88!

1509
01:41:54,314 --> 01:41:56,188
Hut-hut! Hut!

1510
01:41:57,944 --> 01:42:01,194
Kingman. Back to throw.
He's f.orced out of. the pocket.

1511
01:42:02,323 --> 01:42:04,149
And now f.Iips it...

1512
01:42:04,824 --> 01:42:06,403
Webber with the catch!

1513
01:42:07,077 --> 01:42:09,948
But he cuts inside.
Does not go to the outside.

1514
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:11,872
Can't get out of. bounds
to stop the clock.

1515
01:42:11,998 --> 01:42:13,328
Webber needed to get out of. bounds.

1516
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,202
He knows
that they don't have any timeouts lef.t.

1517
01:42:15,336 --> 01:42:17,957
Now, it's up to Kingman to get
his team to the line of. scrimmage

1518
01:42:18,088 --> 01:42:19,463
and call a play quickly.

1519
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:21,997
Black! Fifty-nine razor!

1520
01:42:22,134 --> 01:42:23,166
T ake Drake!

1521
01:42:23,302 --> 01:42:27,300
Now second down with 24 seconds
lef.t f.rom the Boston 44.

1522
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:28,806
Out of. the shotgun.

1523
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,137
Can't f.ind anybody, he's on the run.

1524
01:42:32,269 --> 01:42:34,309
There's the "Kingman Swing. "

1525
01:42:35,105 --> 01:42:37,680
Kingman with some f.ancy f.ootwork.

1526
01:42:37,817 --> 01:42:40,818
Fancy? The King looks
downright gracef.ul all of. a sudden.

1527
01:42:40,944 --> 01:42:43,565
He's to the 25... The 20...

1528
01:42:43,698 --> 01:42:46,448
He took a hard hit! Oh, man!

1529
01:42:46,574 --> 01:42:49,198
Knocked out of. bounds at the 17.

1530
01:42:49,328 --> 01:42:51,368
Come on, Joe. Get up. Get up, Joe!

1531
01:42:51,497 --> 01:42:53,953
Can he get up, though?
That's the question.

1532
01:42:57,712 --> 01:42:58,791
Yeah!

1533
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:03,797
I'll tell you, Kingman continues to
show his toughness.

1534
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:06,216
And, Marv, with f.our seconds lef.t to go
in the game,

1535
01:43:06,345 --> 01:43:09,963
I don't know a quarterback
who doesn't live f.or a moment like this.

1536
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:13,634
Come on, guys. Come on, team.
Come on.

1537
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:16,228
Come on, Rebels! You can do it!

1538
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:18,600
Come on, number one!

1539
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:20,939
Great block, Webber. Great block.

1540
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:22,396
It has come down to this.

1541
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,194
With time for one last play,
Kingman brings his team to the line.

1542
01:43:26,324 --> 01:43:28,815
Can he pull of.f. yet another miracle?

1543
01:43:28,952 --> 01:43:31,787
Marv, this is Joe Kingman's moment.
Can he deliver?

1544
01:43:31,912 --> 01:43:33,787
This is the stuf.f.
that legends are made of..

1545
01:43:33,914 --> 01:43:35,493
Come on, Daddy!

1546
01:43:36,042 --> 01:43:37,787
Check 52! 52!

1547
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,796
I'm going to show you
who the real king is, Joe.

1548
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,716
You about to get done lit up, son!

1549
01:43:45,844 --> 01:43:48,132
What? Are you stupid or something?

1550
01:43:48,262 --> 01:43:50,755
"Stupid" is a mean word!

1551
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,765
Hut-hut! Hut!

1552
01:43:55,645 --> 01:43:57,436
Stay off my quarterback!

1553
01:43:57,564 --> 01:44:00,898
In what could be
the f.inal play of. the season

1554
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:04,395
Kingman looking downf.ield.
He has Sanders.

1555
01:44:13,162 --> 01:44:14,908
It is caught!

1556
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:19,038
Touchdown!
Boston has won the championship!

1557
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:37,802
Let's go watch my MVP
take your 25 million, shall we?

1558
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,644
An incredible ending
to a magnif.icent career.

1559
01:44:41,902 --> 01:44:44,653
Joe Kingman, f.inally a champion.

1560
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:48,645
Okay, Joe. This is it.
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers."

1561
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:51,190
Hey, Joe Kingman,
you've just won the championship,

1562
01:44:51,328 --> 01:44:53,485
so what are you going to do now?

1563
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:58,286
I'm going to take my daughter home.

1564
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:13,338
Daddy, you won the championship.

1565
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:16,345
Oh, Peyton,
I've won much more than that.

1566
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,515
Yeah!

1567
01:48:14,867 --> 01:48:16,694
And cut!
