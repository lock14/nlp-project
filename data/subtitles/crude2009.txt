2
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:42,007
Oil is the excrement of the devil,
El excremento del diablo.

3
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,568
Oil is black blood.

4
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,180
Oil is the blood of the dinosaurs.

5
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:04,153
This is the bloodstream of the world economy.

6
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,961
Oil is the blood of the Earth.

7
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:33,650
We are moving from an era
of cheap, abundant energy

8
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:38,980
to an era of scarce, hard
to get, expensive energy.

9
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:48,536
At the same time, we are
making ourselves dependent

10
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:53,153
on some extremely unstable regimes in
some very nasty parts of the world.

11
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:08,264
Keeping the World dependent
on oil as long as possible

12
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,221
is important.

13
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:19,856
Not one in fifty, not one in a
hundred of the people in our country

14
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:24,009
have any inkling of the potential
problem that we're facing.

15
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:34,088
Increased unemployment, poverty,
bankruptcy, starvation,

16
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:38,268
they're all of a kind of the things
that happen when a society collapses.

17
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:49,337
So we enter an entirely new world
of quite unbelievable dimensions,

18
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:51,579
and yet it's only a few years away.

19
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,614
Hello, folks, I'm a carbon atom.

20
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:08,808
And since I'm an essential part in
each of the hydrocarbons in crude oil,

21
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,163
I'm here to give you the
inside dope on gasoline.

22
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,320
Oil is not like wheat, we are
not growing it every year.

23
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:24,099
Oil is an outcome of many millions
of years of geological history.

24
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,943
The great bulk of the World's oil was
formed at just two very brief moments

25
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,247
of extreme global warming, 90
and 150 million years ago.

26
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,347
Animals and plants that died in
the ocean were compressed by

27
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,317
more deposits of sand, and over the years

28
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:54,212
these deposits squished and
compacted more and more,

29
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:58,063
and then, over time, they were cooked,
which was what we call "the kitchen".

30
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,683
And when the organic material was

31
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,873
buried to a depth of about 2000 meters,

32
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:09,200
chemical reactions converted it into oil.

33
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:18,771
This was formed once, briefly,
over geological time.

34
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:24,615
And so, we are using this stuff
up over one or two centuries.

35
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:46,011
One barrel of oil, the refined product
that with 42 gallons of gasoline

36
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,733
you can buy for a little
over a hundred dollars

37
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:53,298
will produce as much energy, as much work

38
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:58,606
as you would get from 12 people
working all year for you.

39
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:05,853
You take an average man, performing
physical labor for 25000 hours,

40
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,933
to produce the amount of energy just
contained in that one barrel of oil.

41
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,260
That barrel of oil, if it's
pulled out of the ground in Iraq,

42
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,488
can be pulled out of the
ground for one dollar.

43
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:20,937
You invest a dollar and you get
back 25000 hours of human labor.

44
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:25,763
That is an energy source that is so
dense, it's essentially free energy.

45
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,559
All non-renewable, it's all
extremely capital intensive

46
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:34,935
and it's probably the most invaluable raw
natural resource we've ever discovered.

47
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:46,334
You are about to know the thrill of seeing
that which has never been seen before.

48
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:51,793
You are about to enter a beautiful,
exciting, wonderful new world.

49
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,516
The world if 1960.

50
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,916
For the first time in history, you'll see:

51
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,214
A wonderful new world of Fords.

52
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,051
The 1960 Thunderbird!

53
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:25,001
Oil is our God. And ok, if somebody
says they worship Jesus, Buddha, Allah,

54
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,108
whoever, they actually worhip petroleum.

55
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,834
70% of the barrel of oil is refined
into transportation fuels.

56
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:54,949
Which include motor gasoline,
diesel fuel, jet fuel,

57
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,383
railroad fuel and maritime fuel.

58
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,966
98% of all transportation
energy comes from oil.

59
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,914
Construction of an average car

60
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,842
consumes somewhere between
the energy equivalent of

61
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:18,353
27 and 54 barrels of oil, depending
on whose statistics you use.

62
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,107
Construction of an average desktop computer

63
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,719
consumes 10 times its weight in fossil fuels.

64
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,357
Microchip consumes 630 times its weight
in fossil fuels during its construction.

65
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,390
For every calorie that you
eat in the United States and

66
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,810
probably similar number in
other industrialized nations,

67
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,464
burns 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy.

68
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,686
There are 6.4 billion people, I
think, living on the planet now,

69
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:59,315
most of them are reasonably well
fed and that's the consequence of

70
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:02,396
what was called the Green Revolution in
the second half of the 20th century.

71
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,885
Green Revolution consisted
in very large measure

72
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,195
of fertilizing land with petrochemicals,

73
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,450
fertilizers that are derived from petroleum.

74
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:17,164
Farming has changed more in the last 50
years than it did in the previous 1000.

75
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:21,358
A farmer today can work 5 times
the land his father worked,

76
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:25,634
and still have time for leisure
that his father never knew.

77
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:35,232
The petroleum that runs
these modern hired hands

78
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,202
has not confined progress
and farming to the fields,

79
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,255
Life is easier for the farm wife, too.

80
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,054
What it comes down to is that the oil
industry has to please Mrs. Martin,

81
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,020
and millions just like her.

82
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:53,108
Already today she has used
some 87 petroleum products,

83
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:57,535
including the plastic bacon wrapper
and the wax of the milk cotton.

84
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,069
She'll top a 100 before the day is over.

85
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:07,175
Liquids that come out of oil
as it's processed and refined,

86
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:10,818
create the building block for all of our

87
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,967
petrochemical, chemical,
plastic, pharmaceutical,

88
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,374
you know, zillions of things: Tires,

89
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:21,104
insecticides, cosmetics, weed killers,

90
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,247
A whole galaxy of things to
make a better life on Earth.

91
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:29,629
And you know, it isn't just oil companies

92
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,631
that try to outdo each other
competing for the customer's dollar,

93
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:37,384
the same story is true of
almost every successful

94
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,671
business enterprise on the whole planet.

95
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,379
Well, whether you know it or not,

96
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,474
every single preparation on this
beautiful lady's dressing table,

97
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:49,567
every single thing she is
wearing, is influenced by oil.

98
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:53,294
Just before her, let's take away all
these articles dependent upon petroleum:

99
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:57,213
Her hand mirror, cosmetics, perfume

100
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,647
and manicure set made of plastics.

101
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,769
Her synthetic silk negligee,
her silk under...

102
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:09,698
ooh, science can go no further.

103
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:30,008
The Caspian Sea was one of the
earlies oil provinces in the world.

104
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,923
People were simply digging
holes to produce oil in Baku

105
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:48,901
and oil production really took
off when western oil companies

106
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:56,395
were granted concessions in the late 1800's.

107
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:15,343
By 1900, 95% of Russian
oil was coming from Baku.

108
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:24,199
In their heyday these
oilfields produced up to

109
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:28,282
5000 tons of crude oil per day.

110
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,048
Baku then became a huge industrial centre

111
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,623
and one of the most affluent
cities in the world.

112
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:50,118
Where is daddy, mommy?

113
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:53,281
Well, Jeff, I'll just show you.

114
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:59,620
We are here, in the United States.

115
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,883
And daddy is down here, in Venezuela.

116
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,483
Here, where the lake
Maracaibo oil fields are.

117
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:24,316
That's where daddy is working, Jeff.

118
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,860
And when he finds a place for us to live,

119
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:29,032
we're going down there too.

120
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:33,460
Venezuela discovered oil at the
beginning of the 20th century.

121
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,039
The real first discovery was about 1914.

122
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:52,367
The real turning point was on
the 16th of December, 1922

123
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:56,685
when there was a blowout in a well
that was being drilled at Cabimas,

124
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:59,091
and it became known as the
day of the black rain.

125
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:02,721
150 thousand barrels in the air,
for two or three days running.

126
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,956
And that put Venezuela an the
world oil map, once and for all.

127
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:11,742
In that one time, Venezuela became
the largest exporter in the world.

128
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,781
It was the US, not Saudi Arabia that was
the world's leading producer of oil,

129
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,586
and in fact much of our
military and industrial might

130
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:42,061
arose out of our giant oil industry.

131
00:13:56,445 --> 00:14:01,078
We were, essentialy, the Saudi Arabia
of the world up until about the 1950s.

132
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,764
McCamey was a boom town for many, many years.

133
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:19,613
Their attitude was that this
was going to last from now on,

134
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:22,488
and I know that those people
then could not foresee

135
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:27,204
you were ever going to pump all the oil
out of the ground in this part of Texas.

136
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,222
And they couldn't picture
ever running out of oil

137
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,537
because it was everywhere
and got on everything.

138
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:14,328
Off course now we realize that
you're going to deplete your supply,

139
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,720
sooner or later.

140
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,338
They're not making a lot
of dinosaurs anymore.

141
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,723
Oil is a magnet for war.

142
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,776
Oil starts wars.

143
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:18,935
The Sudan, for example, Darfur.

144
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:22,303
What everybody is treating as an
ethnic and a religious struggle

145
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:27,969
is infact, in part, a struggle about
major oil finds located in the south.

146
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:31,297
Which means that the government
in the north, a different

147
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,941
ethnic and religious makeup,
is displacing those people

148
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,281
and moving them out of the area
so that those oil revenues

149
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,977
belong to them.

150
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,292
Oil has always been associated with war.

151
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,221
Our very first wars, World
War I, World War II,

152
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:12,136
have very important elements of oil in them,

153
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,655
as a reason for the war, as
allowing the war to go on,

154
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,213
as a way of securing supply.

155
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:33,422
During World War II, which was the war
of engines, the continuous supply

156
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:37,560
of oil from Baku ensured the Russian
victory against the Germans.

157
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:06,313
During the 70s there were the
political problems, the war between

158
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:10,782
the Egyptians and the Israelis in
which the oil boycott took place.

159
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:20,462
Khomeini's revolution, we have
the Palestinian problems,

160
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,822
wars between Iraq and Iran...

161
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:45,914
First war that was absolutely
about oil was Saddam Hussein's

162
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:49,545
invasion of Kuwait which was
really about seizing an oil field.

163
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:30,961
Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

164
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:38,400
Iraq oil is a giant that has been
kept dormant for so many, many years

165
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:43,474
This oil has been the least explored,

166
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:47,572
the least developed, and the least produced.

167
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,721
There are lots of people
who will tell you that

168
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,586
oil had nothing to do with the
war, if you go to Washington.

169
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:12,942
And we used to call it the
O-word that nobody would say.

170
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:17,396
But in fact, all evidence points
to the fact that the United States

171
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,655
which did not secure areas of
weapons of mass destruction,

172
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,766
but did in fact secure the oil fields.
The United States had plans

173
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,710
to bring in US companies in Iraq where they

174
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:30,377
have previously not been allowed to operate.

175
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:34,997
That there were maps of the oil fields
involved in the planning of the war,

176
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:38,834
that in 1998, long before the war
people were arguing for this

177
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:43,193
as the way of securing energy
supplies in the United States.

178
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:48,267
I can't get inside their heads to know all
of the rationale for going to war in Iraq

179
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,525
but there are many people who believe
at least a part of the reasons

180
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,266
for being there is the geopolitical
position of Iraq and the fact

181
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,112
that it's right in the
middle of world's oil patch.

182
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,175
The Iraqis wanted to get
rid of Saddam Hussein.

183
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:16,235
And they were happy that the Americans
helped, but look at what happened.

184
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:24,925
After Saddam Hussein,
there is no institutions,

185
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:30,165
there's no state, there's no army,
there's no real police force,

186
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:34,771
people are kidnapped, killed, decapitated...

187
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,907
There is no law, they made the
country stateless, without a state.

188
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,859
Instead of creating conditions for peace,

189
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:54,750
they are making conditions for conflict.

190
00:22:56,813 --> 00:23:01,529
More and more oil is going to come
from less and less stable places.

191
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:05,778
Less and less secure places,
places that actually challenge

192
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,556
taking of oil in the first place.

193
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:13,424
Oil fuels war, it's a catalyst for war,

194
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,718
it is something that prolonges
war, it intensifies war,

195
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,743
this is not a pretty picture.

196
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:43,702
I suppose that the classification of reserves

197
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:47,649
depends on the motivations of the
person that's classified them.

198
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,825
Try to keep people guessing in
a way, keep them off balance.

199
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,909
Most numbers that you will see
around the world that lead

200
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:59,130
to these numbers that we
were talking about include

201
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:03,118
proven plus probable, and
sometimes even possible.

202
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:10,832
In fact, the public data is extremely
misleading and misunderstood,

203
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:17,914
OPEC exaggerated how much oil it's got
left, for all sorts of political reasons.

204
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:22,754
You know, this is an old story,

205
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,592
casting doubt on the numbers of reserves
in the Middle East, as published.

206
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:38,595
In 1985 Kuwait over night
added 50% to its reserves,

207
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:43,228
at that time the OPEC quota, that
is the amount of oil that each

208
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,047
of the OPEC countries could produce was based

209
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:48,151
on the reported reserves.

210
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:51,231
So the more you reported,
the more you could produce.

211
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:57,611
Two years later Venezuela doubled
its reserves over night,

212
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,912
and that caused the other
countries, finally Saudi Arabia

213
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:03,758
to announce enormous increases over night,

214
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,714
simply to protect their production quota.

215
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:13,053
And these numbers have not changed since.

216
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,656
And it's absolutely implausible
to imagine that the

217
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,915
number should stay the same, when
they're all the time producing.

218
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:22,830
I've asked them that same question.

219
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:27,546
You know, you produce 8 or 9
million barrels of oil a day,

220
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:31,204
and at the end of the year the
reserves are the same as they were

221
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:34,174
at the beginning, as the same
as they were 10 years ago,

222
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:37,048
they said "Well that's our plan."

223
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:42,851
You know, "We produce this oil,
then we prove up reserves to offset

224
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:46,151
the oil that we produced
during the year, so at

225
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,767
the beginning of the next year, our
reserves are exactly what they were

226
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,119
the year before."

227
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:57,206
Would you believe that or not? I don't
know, but that's what they say.

228
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,740
Their plan, that's the way it works.

229
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,940
OPEC countries do not care about
what might happen 20 years from now,

230
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:16,443
or 30 years or 40 years, they care
about what they get now today.

231
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,187
Because, these are politicians,
they want more money,

232
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:23,332
more money to spend.

233
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:28,558
Rationally or irationally, whatever
it is, but they have budgets.

234
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:31,514
And they became prisoners of their budget.

235
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,238
What may happen 20 years from now,

236
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:42,226
by that time they are dead. They don't care.

237
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:14,141
I'm afraid that we're gonna
run out of oil and gas

238
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:17,633
a lot sooner than lots of people think.

239
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:22,597
Well it appears to me that when it peaks,

240
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,732
that they've taken more than
half of it out of the ground.

241
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,564
Of course, as time goes
on they might find a way

242
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,397
to extract more of that oil than they do now.

243
00:27:31,497 --> 00:27:34,958
They can extract it over a period
of time, but it's not necessarily

244
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:40,060
economically feasible, well it
might be at $50 a barrel or more.

245
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,731
But we're gonna come to time
when we don't have oil.

246
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:47,073
This is one of the, you know,

247
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:51,515
the obsession of many oil people and,

248
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:56,203
they say "Well, we will reach a point in which
oil production will not increase anymore

249
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,472
and we'll be equally peaking out."

250
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:04,413
And then it will decrease slowly. We are
here, we are near, we are not, nobody knows.

251
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:10,504
They tried to take the example of the
oil production in the United States.

252
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:16,857
The real saga of petroleum continues
at a greater pace than ever.

253
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:22,013
Down in Peru, in California,
Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania.

254
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:26,125
Millions of workers, engineers,
geologists find new reserves,

255
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,205
build new rigs, sink new shafts.

256
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:33,825
US have been the largest oil producer
on Earth for almost a hundred years.

257
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,754
And nobody thought we'd ever peak.

258
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,398
The pump does not know when midnight comes.

259
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:43,203
Days are the same to it.

260
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:46,778
Each day, every day

261
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:50,669
it brings us another 24 hours of progress.

262
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:56,087
Building our nation, guarding its security,

263
00:28:56,582 --> 00:29:00,130
assuring the future of America.

264
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:05,616
And many, if not all, oil geologists
thought that that was going forever.

265
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,476
Throughout this half century, Dr. Hubbert

266
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,144
has been a continuous
student of energy resources

267
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:13,591
and their implications in human affairs.

268
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,098
As long as 20 years ago, Dr. Hubbert was

269
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:19,655
pointing out to his colleagues
in the petroleum industry

270
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:22,406
that the United States would
probably reach its peak

271
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,871
of petroleum production
within 10 to 15 years.

272
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:29,597
He was virtually laughed out of his profession
for making such a ridiculous prediction.

273
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,856
The optimists back then
were saying "This is crazy,

274
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,816
we're finding 6 barrels of oil for
every barrel that we consume."

275
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,675
"We're never gonna run out or
peak, or anything like that."

276
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:43,815
He realized that oil discovery had
peaked in the 1930s and was declining.

277
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,376
And he could extrapolate that to figure out
how much oil there would be altogether.

278
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,965
The amount that you discover initially
starts out rising very rapidly

279
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:55,352
but after a while it slows down because
there's less of it to discover.

280
00:29:55,452 --> 00:30:00,825
And eventually it will turn over and
come back down again like that.

281
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:04,620
Now the rate of production of
oil, extraction and use of oil

282
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,768
will be a second bell-shaped curve
and it comes necessarily later

283
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:10,766
that this, because you have to
discover it before you can produce it.

284
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:14,300
So it will be a second curve
like this, for production.

285
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,739
And it too will eventually go
to zero, and this peak here,

286
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:26,662
the peak in the production curve, is
what's referred to as Hubbert's peak.

287
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:32,547
If we have only produced about
50 billion barrels in 100 years,

288
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:36,851
and if we have 100 billion
barrels still to go...

289
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:40,426
I wonder how long will it be
before there's an oil shortage?

290
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:46,325
The US will hit the peak of oil production
in about 10 or 15 years from that date.

291
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:50,533
When 1970 came along, sure enough, it
happened just as he said it would.

292
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,686
It turns out that in December 1970

293
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:03,101
the US peaked at 10.2 million barrels a day,

294
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,140
and then oil prices went through the roof,

295
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:10,003
we went on a drilling
boom of epic proportion.

296
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:18,543
10 years later we were drilling
and completing 4.5 times

297
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,228
more oil wells than we were
doing back when we peaked,

298
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,569
and our domestic oil production
from the lower 48 and

299
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,323
the shallow waters of the intercontinetal
shelf had already declined

300
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:33,421
from 10.2 million barrels a day
to 6.9 million barrels a day.

301
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:39,993
It doesn't sound terribly
illogical for the living on

302
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:42,950
more oil consumed every year
than we found for 30 years.

303
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:46,456
I guess it's inevitable sooner or
later we were gonna reach that.

304
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:55,944
The last great frontiers
of new oil discoveries

305
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:59,464
turned out to be Alaska North Slope oil,

306
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:03,466
Siberian oil and the North Sea.

307
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:11,482
And those discoveries
happened in 1967, 68 and 69.

308
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,889
Finding oil in the North
Sea was a big surprise,

309
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,900
noone could reasonably have expected that.

310
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:34,665
Our famous Lady Thatcher came to power,

311
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,694
she said we want initiative
and enterprise and enthusiasm

312
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:42,378
and competition and all these things.
And, sure enough,

313
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,216
everybody went to produce oil
as fast as they knew how.

314
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:51,235
But there's a strange irony
relating to this subject,

315
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,374
that the better you do the job
of exploiting oil and gas

316
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:57,945
the sooner it is gone.

317
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,073
The British government now admits

318
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:13,483
that it becomes a net
importer next year, I think.

319
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:17,622
And that it's gone in 2020.
This is a huge change.

320
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:33,298
So to imagine that there's any well missed

321
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:36,777
as big as North Sea is just implausible.

322
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:45,494
As we look around the world
into other countries,

323
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:50,486
we see this same pattern being
repeated in one country after another.

324
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:54,776
Today there's about 58 countries
that are physically producing

325
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,568
less today than they have in the past.

326
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:16,873
The world has now been sufficiently explored

327
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:21,397
for the oil industry to know
now all the promising areas.

328
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,697
All the big promising areas
have been identified.

329
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,734
We're always a drill bat away,
from some fabulous new territory,

330
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:35,079
that's the great thing about exploration.
But, realistically

331
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,994
it's been a long, long period of time,

332
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:42,944
since we've actually discovered
a significant new basin.

333
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:47,936
I am hopeful and optimistic about the way

334
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:54,096
inovation, scientific
technology and oil engineers

335
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:57,121
can continue findind more oil.

336
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,254
I love hearing all these
economists say, well,

337
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:06,471
"Technology and ingenuity will
bring out all these changes."

338
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:09,992
And I say "Give me a break." I do
know oil field technology backwards

339
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:12,274
and forwards and the blackboard is dry.

340
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:16,757
And it took 30 to 35 years to
develop all of these great tools.

341
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:20,538
We already have fantastic
technology to find oil,

342
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:24,580
we have seismic surveys which
are of unbeliveable resolution,

343
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,936
you can see the smallest
formations in the Earth's crust.

344
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,497
We have very advanced
engineering to produce oil.

345
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:40,668
And all of these great tools that
ended up being great enhanched

346
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:44,574
production techniques, were
basically super-straws

347
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:49,593
just sucking the last easy oil out
of the ground at faster rates,

348
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:54,145
and to no extent significantly
increasing the amount of oil

349
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:56,881
that was gonna be produced
from a significant oil field.

350
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,930
That was all myth.

351
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:15,472
Some oil is cheap, easy, fast to
produce, others is the exact opposite.

352
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,934
There's a big difference
between producing oil from

353
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:25,468
free flowing well in the Middle
East that just comes roaring out,

354
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:28,095
and digging up a tar sand in Canada,

355
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:30,872
which is more or less a mining operation.

356
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:37,940
They are using more energy from natural gas

357
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,220
to produce the oil than they're getting
from oil shales and tar sands.

358
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,999
So that even the fact that people are saying
"Well, we're gonna tap the oil sands."

359
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:53,327
that right there tells you
that we're close to peaking.

360
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:58,497
Because you don't go to those areas,
unless you've used up all the good stuff.

361
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,581
2/3 of the oil reserves
are in the Middle East,

362
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,455
which mean basically the
Persian Gulf, and that's

363
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:18,312
10 times as much as any other source.

364
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:29,835
Right now, the only region of the world
that hasn't peaked is the Middle East.

365
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,523
Most of the serious projections
for 2030 envision the Middle East

366
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,906
producing 50-51 million barrels a day.

367
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:12,874
We know that Iran peaked at 6
million barrels a day back in 1978,

368
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,504
struggles to stay between 3 and
3.5 million barrels a day.

369
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:21,578
Kuwait struggles to keep their 2.5
million barrels a day intact,

370
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:24,067
they keep "Maybe we can add a
half million barrels a day,

371
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,449
maybe the UAE can add half a million
barrels a day." So to get there

372
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:32,688
you would have to have Saudi Arabia
be producing between 20 and 25

373
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:35,631
million, or even 30 million barrels a day.

374
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,579
Those days are long gone. You know,
up to 15 million barrels a day is now

375
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:47,676
their sort of new magic number
for 50, 75 or even a 100 years.

376
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:51,471
There are other powerful
voices within Saudi Arabia

377
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:54,978
that are clearly sending the message out

378
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:59,446
"12 million barrels a day? Yeah, that's
probably ok, but we really shouldn't

379
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:02,499
even think about producing
any more than that, ever."

380
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:10,846
They had an intense exploration
effort for the last 35 years

381
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:15,616
and with the exception of one field,
the Qatif Field, that's the only

382
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:22,176
significant exploration success
they had from 1967 through 2005.

383
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:30,605
If Saudi Arabia has now exceeded
their sustainable peak supply,

384
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:35,171
then I would argue with
some clarity that the World

385
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:39,090
has now exceeded sustainable peak supply.

386
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:58,492
When you reach the peak, you're
at the top of the mountain.

387
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,934
Sometimes, down the other side is

388
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:11,637
very, very gradual slide, and other times
down the other side is fairly stiff.

389
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:22,129
What really matters, and matters
enormously, is the view

390
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:27,244
that comes into sight on the other side
of this peak, when we see this long

391
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:31,919
relentless, remorseless decline
heading off into the valley.

392
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,138
Point is that the whole world has got
used to this growing side of the

393
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,988
mountain range, has to
face the opposite side.

394
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,046
We have moved now to the point in which

395
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:54,319
virtually everyone accepts
that there is a peak.

396
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:58,306
M. King Hubbert had predicted that
worldwide it should be occuring about the

397
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,242
turn of the century. That slipped a little
because of the Arab oil embargo and the

398
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:06,020
oil price spike highs and the
worldwide recession that

399
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:08,976
reduced the demand for
oil quite significantly.

400
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:13,858
And it's now pushed peak oil off till,
many people believe, about now.

401
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:18,162
We are coming to the end of the
first half of the age of oil.

402
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,267
During this 150 years,
we have seen the growth

403
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:30,730
of everything. Of industry,
transport, trade, agriculture.

404
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:34,237
We've seen an explosion
of the number of people.

405
00:41:37,523 --> 00:41:43,683
All of this was made possible by the cheap,
abundant supply of oil based energy.

406
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:01,669
Demand is on the march, and
supply is flattening out.

407
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,325
You will have to supply, if
you want to meet the demand,

408
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:09,754
from the current level of 80
million barrels a day to a 120

409
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,600
millions barrels a day in year 2030.

410
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,543
But, in order to meet that profile,

411
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:20,273
you would have to add new oil in the
amount of 200 millions barrels a day.

412
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,168
Because a lot of that new oil will
have to go to compensate for depletion

413
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:27,410
of existing wells.

414
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:44,818
In the early 70s over half the globe
essentially didn't use any oil.

415
00:42:56,643 --> 00:43:00,686
The only serious oil consumers were Europe,

416
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,866
not an awful a lot of
Japan, the United States,

417
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:08,318
Canada, and the former Soviet Union.

418
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:12,731
Africa didn't use any oil of any volume.

419
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:21,037
Middle East didn't use any oil. None of
Asia used any oil, and neither did Japan.

420
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:25,588
Today, Papua New Guinea hardly uses any oil.

421
00:43:25,808 --> 00:43:29,507
There's probably a two or three islands in
the South Pacific that don't use any oil.

422
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:35,640
Everybody else is hooked on trying to
create a society that looks like us.

423
00:43:43,904 --> 00:43:49,198
The demand for energy is rising faster
than was predicted even 5 years ago.

424
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:53,667
People all around the world can see
the way the developed countries live,

425
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:57,118
and how good life the
people have in those areas.

426
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:59,965
So they want to emulate us, they
want to be able to drive cars,

427
00:43:59,992 --> 00:44:02,605
they wanna live in nice houses.
They wanna have air conditioning

428
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:05,795
and refrigeration. And why shouldn't they?

429
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:23,891
Demand for energy will only increase
as India's standard of living rises,

430
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:28,277
its economy becomes even
more diverse and dynamic,

431
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:33,709
and it continues to narrow the
gap with more developed nations.

432
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,657
China is not about to have a hard
landing, they're exponentially

433
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:55,434
expanding their need for energy.

434
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:58,074
And they're just getting started.

435
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,727
Most urban Chinese believe that
they will own a car within 5 years,

436
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,697
it is the fastest growing
automobile market on Earth.

437
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:14,616
Something like a third of them
already have driver's licences.

438
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:19,003
And so, the demand for oil
and for gasoline in China

439
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:21,409
is really going to take off.

440
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,103
Last year China increased their
importation of oil by 25%,

441
00:45:31,117 --> 00:45:33,427
they're now the number 2
importer in the world.

442
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,776
They increased their use of
oil, I read a figure of 14.7%.

443
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:43,438
But that's very consistent with an
economy that's growing at 10% a year and

444
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,573
by the way, at 10% growth
rate it doubles in 7 years,

445
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:50,656
4 times bigger in 14 years and they're
requiring more and more energy.

446
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:55,111
China and India are kind of
getting to the party when the

447
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:58,164
glass is literally half empty, at this point.

448
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:02,908
So, they're gonna have to fight with
the rest of us to get what's left.

449
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:18,543
Well, the Hummer, I believe
is more of a status symbol.

450
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:23,067
Where, you know, "Look at me, look at me."

451
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:26,628
"I can afford the Hummer,
I'm driving the best."

452
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:32,582
You're going to get somewhere around 10
miles per gallon, constant on the road.

453
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:35,909
That's either highway or city driving.

454
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:42,977
6.0 liter, 325 horse power at
380 foot-pounds of torque.

455
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,609
Well, we are a role model
whether we like it or not,

456
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:05,473
we use 25% of the world's oil.

457
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:11,881
We're only 1 person in 22, we have
only 2% of the known reserves of oil.

458
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:20,145
We are prohibitive users of energy.

459
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,899
But we'll go on doing that so long as
we are rich and the energy is cheap.

460
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,854
We pay more for bottle of drinking
water than we go for gasoline.

461
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:37,237
Gasoline is just about the cheapest
liquid you can buy in the United States,

462
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:40,977
and as long as that's true, Americans
are not going to be concerned.

463
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:47,838
Service that is tops, and
gas that's extra fine

464
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,822
there's a smile for every
mile at the Esso sun.

465
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:58,358
E - s - s - o - makes - your - car - gooo.
Happy motoring!

466
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:05,013
In America we right now think... People
are having their eyes gouged out

467
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:11,132
paying $3.20 for a gallon of gasoline.
That's 20 cents a cup.

468
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:16,577
And 20 cents a cup sound pretty trivial
but if you have a passenger car,

469
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:21,514
average american passenger car,
you can get 1 to 6 people in it

470
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:24,745
throw a bunch of stuff in the trunk,

471
00:48:24,845 --> 00:48:28,471
go a mile and a half in
20 minutes, for 20 cents.

472
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:30,877
Now if you don't have gasoline,

473
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:33,655
and you try to bargain with a
guy with a horse driven car

474
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:37,519
or someone coming by with a bicycle or maybe
you're lucky enough to have a rikshaw.

475
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:42,937
"Excuse me, would any of you like to
take me and my friends a mile and a half

476
00:48:42,951 --> 00:48:46,182
for 20 cents?" Those
people would laugh at you.

477
00:48:46,282 --> 00:48:53,511
So, I would think that we would
need to get oil prices up to

478
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:59,505
you know, $5 a cup, some number
that starts to equate with

479
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:03,508
what we actually spend readily on a
lot of things that are nearly as

480
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,193
valuable and also are non-renewable.

481
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:17,134
People in third world countries
cannot understand why, for instance

482
00:49:17,176 --> 00:49:24,051
the Europeans try their best in
conservation measures and taxation measures

483
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:26,581
and the Americans are not doing it.

484
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:45,708
Not one in fifty, not one in a
hundred of the people in our country

485
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:50,040
have any inkling of the potential
problem that we're facing.

486
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:55,897
If we wait until peak oil to start
making the transition, there will be

487
00:49:55,911 --> 00:50:01,205
very serious economic consequences.
If we anticipated by 10 years

488
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,969
there would be meaningful
economic consequences.

489
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:08,424
To have no economic consequences, you
need to anticipate it by 20 years.

490
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:11,573
I'm almost dead certain
we don't have 20 years,

491
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:14,364
I don't think we have 10 years, I
think we're pretty much there.

492
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:17,857
Thank you all for coming, please be seated.

493
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:21,721
Lay the facts out for everybody to see.

494
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:26,615
I don't think that people in
positions to tell the public

495
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:28,692
about it from an official standpoint

496
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:31,456
have been totally honest
with us about the problem.

497
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:35,306
The person who will win an election
is somebody who can most persuasively

498
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:39,871
lie to the population, which is
tell them what they wanna hear.

499
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:43,185
Which is that the future's gonna
be great, just follow me.

500
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:47,118
If our energy resources
are properly developed,

501
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:51,835
they can fulfill our energy
requirement for centuries to come.

502
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:57,637
What is needed now is decisive and
responsible action to increase

503
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:02,519
our energy supplies. Action which takes
into account the needs of our economy,

504
00:51:02,574 --> 00:51:05,846
of our environment, and
of our national security.

505
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:10,191
In Ancient Greece, the person who
brought bad news was executed,

506
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:14,715
and politicians who bring bad news
frequently are not reelected.

507
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:21,879
Our political system is just
controlled by major corporations.

508
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,596
The steps we need to take to reasonably
address this, in some type of rational way

509
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:28,741
require downscaling.

510
00:51:28,782 --> 00:51:31,890
So if you are the CEO of a big company
are you gonna contribute money

511
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:35,052
to the politician who says "Hey,
I wanna slow down the economy."

512
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,500
"I wanna sell fewer cars."

513
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,689
Obviously, more people will drive less,
and that will cause people to...

514
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,990
The cars won't need to be maintained as much.

515
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,125
That will shrink the automotive
manufacturing sector, which will

516
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,463
shrink the entire economy.
Nobody's gonna vote for that.

517
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,787
I don't even know if I'd vote for that.

518
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:56,902
More than any other country in the
world, America is a nation on wheels.

519
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:05,606
The automobile and the power behind it

520
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:08,617
have been major factors in
the growth of our country.

521
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:12,509
We can drive anywhere we want to,
at any time, for any reason,

522
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,599
including fun.

523
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,576
We're in some ways a
victim of our own success.

524
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:28,230
Suburbia is in a lot of trouble because
the whole model of suburbia is

525
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:33,410
you commute 30, 40, 50 miles
to your job and back.

526
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:41,345
And that's only viable so long as you've
got relatively cheap oil and gas.

527
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:59,128
It's not just that the country is
spread out, we've evolved our cities

528
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:01,889
for the use of cars. The cities will
have to be rebuilt from scratch

529
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:05,279
practically to have more efficient
and usable public transportation.

530
00:53:05,342 --> 00:53:08,310
This is quite different from the
cities in Europe which were already

531
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:11,320
basically in place before
the car was invented.

532
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,368
So, yes, it's going to be a terrible
blow to the United States when we

533
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:24,218
no longer have the oil that we love so much.

534
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:37,356
What we avoided so long and the three things
that we need are now in very short supply.

535
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,611
One of them is money and in our country
we don't worry about money, we just

536
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:44,018
borrow it from our kids and our
grandkids and accumulating a debt.

537
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:46,818
But the other two things we can't
borrow from our kids and our

538
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:50,545
grandkids, and that's time and energy.

539
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:10,244
In order to make energy available
to invest and buy time

540
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:14,629
we have to have a very
vigorous conservation program.

541
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:20,347
Since the US uses the fourth of all the
world's oil, we clearly need to lead there.

542
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:26,166
I believe that our American
people have a great spirit of

543
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:29,083
entrepeneurship and patriotism,
if they really knew what the

544
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:32,507
problem was, that they would be very
responsive in doing what I think

545
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:35,644
are the necessary things to get
ourselves to the other side

546
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:38,157
with as few bumps as possible.

547
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:44,516
If you tell the Americans "There's
a brand new hydrogen powered car

548
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:47,383
that you can go and buy instead of
your car." They'll say "OK, great."

549
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,823
And they'll go buy it. But if you tell
them they're gonna have to use a bicycle,

550
00:54:50,923 --> 00:54:53,859
that's the type of adaptation
that they have to make.

551
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:56,102
People aren't willing to do it.

552
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,856
Sunday, July 20th, 1969.

553
00:55:04,956 --> 00:55:09,966
Around the world, nearly a billion
people watch this moment on television

554
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:14,722
as the first man from Earth
prepared to set foot upon the Moon.

555
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:17,539
If the president of the United
States, as JFK said in the 1960

556
00:55:17,572 --> 00:55:20,001
"We will put a man on the Moon
in this decade.", and we did

557
00:55:20,035 --> 00:55:22,818
an enormous technical challenge
to do that, but we did it.

558
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:26,629
If a president of the United States
said "I challenge our scientists

559
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:30,846
and engineers to teach us how to kick
the fossil fuel habit in a decade.",

560
00:55:30,863 --> 00:55:33,308
I think it could be done.

561
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:37,810
Well the problem that we're
facing is probably more like

562
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:40,881
colonizing Pluto, than
putting the man on the Moon.

563
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:45,181
If JFK had said "We're gonna
have a 100 thousand people

564
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:48,926
living in three-bedroom houses
on Pluto in ten years.",

565
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,911
well obviously we would not have
been able to accomplish it.

566
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:06,196
In the last 40 years, the Bush administration
is the administration that has

567
00:56:06,213 --> 00:56:09,755
the closest connections with
oil companies themselves.

568
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:15,928
And it is the the administration
that has most greatly married

569
00:56:15,945 --> 00:56:19,318
energy security with national
security and the US foreign policy.

570
00:56:19,368 --> 00:56:22,505
When you have only 2% of the
known reserves of oil and

571
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:26,486
use 25% of the world's oil and
import 2/3 of what you use,

572
00:56:26,503 --> 00:56:29,842
that has to affect your foreign policy.

573
00:56:34,312 --> 00:56:38,966
They believe that the way
to secure oil supplies

574
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:43,689
that would in fact get the support
of the American people and

575
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:49,491
create a more stable world is
to democratize the Middle East.

576
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:54,719
They believe that this issue of
promoting democracy to the Middle East

577
00:56:54,753 --> 00:56:58,497
is a way of actually securing oil supplies.

578
00:57:00,942 --> 00:57:07,436
East and West are united in pioneering
a new frontier of progress.

579
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:13,946
Serving the interest of the Saudi Arabs,
serving the interest of the United States,

580
00:57:14,671 --> 00:57:20,709
and demonstrating the vitality of the
American system of free enterprise.

581
00:57:21,215 --> 00:57:24,673
A system, which from this new frontier

582
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,518
is pumping into the trade of the world oil,

583
00:57:28,618 --> 00:57:32,853
one of the materials that is
making a truly great contribution

584
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:37,828
to our modern civilisation.

585
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:49,162
The basis of our foreign policy in
the United States from 1945 to today

586
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:55,637
was essentially an exchange of
secure, cheap, reliable oil

587
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,028
to the United States in return for protection

588
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:02,064
for the governing rulers of Saudi Arabia.

589
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:05,808
That exchange is in fact threatened.

590
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:26,772
10, 15 years ago the per capita income
in the country was about $28000,

591
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:30,854
today it's $6000. There has been a huge drop

592
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:35,104
in the standard of living
of the average Saudi.

593
00:58:49,018 --> 00:58:51,531
Saudi Arabia has got a very young population,

594
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:55,798
a lot of people coming on to the
labor market, not the jobs for them

595
00:58:55,815 --> 00:59:00,588
and the sense they don't feel that they
are the stakeholders in the society,

596
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,174
They feel alienated.

597
00:59:02,224 --> 00:59:05,901
There are lots of tensions between the
oligarchy which rules the country

598
00:59:05,934 --> 00:59:10,016
and the population which inhabits
the country and many people think

599
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,984
within the fundamentalist movement that the

600
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:17,319
regime, the goverment of Saudi
Arabia is totally corrupt,

601
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:21,856
that it is basically selling the
oil to the West, and the West

602
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:25,903
is arming the regime, and the regime uses
the guns against its own population.

603
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:32,312
The fundamentalist movement
is strong and it's dangerous.

604
00:59:41,572 --> 00:59:44,962
No doubt that some of these
people who are making

605
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:49,988
problems in Iraq and committing terorrist
chastises are actually Saudis.

606
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:56,616
This is a formula for real
conflict, this is a formula

607
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,719
for a country that is on the way

608
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:03,531
to some very very dangerous outcomes.

609
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:09,670
The stability of Saudi Arabia over the
long run is in fact questionable.

610
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:28,678
If their kingdom was to fall
apart, it's very unlikely that

611
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:32,203
the United States, particularly, would
simply stand by and let it fall apart,

612
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,137
given its significance as
an oil exporting country.

613
01:00:40,754 --> 01:00:44,734
We would see certainly the
US intervention, despite

614
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:50,148
all the lessons and the problems
that have been associated with Iraq.

615
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:55,292
One thing that many people, me included,
fear is that when this happens

616
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:58,328
we will simply go and take by force
of arms the oil that we need.

617
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:00,458
And that will make us into
a very different country

618
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:03,016
and the world into a very different world.

619
01:01:03,674 --> 01:01:07,756
We're looking at, essentially,
a generation long,

620
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:11,736
multigenerational resource wars.

621
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:18,988
Ultimately, there really
are only two options.

622
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:25,937
One is to militarize the
taking of oil, which means to

623
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:29,968
get your population to understand
that if they want to continue

624
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:34,488
to drive SUV's and have the cars and
consume energy in the way they are,

625
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:38,057
that they will be in war after war.

626
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:44,995
The other position is to begin to
prepare for what we all see coming,

627
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:47,702
which is an end to the era of cheap oil,

628
01:01:47,752 --> 01:01:53,760
and to invest in alternative
technologies for energy

629
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:58,281
that are cleaner, safer, and
have less detrimental effects

630
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:03,705
on the political and social makeup of
oil exporting countries themselves.

631
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:13,250
For a century we didn't spend a nanosecond

632
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:17,939
actually really taxing ourselves as
to could we ever actually come up

633
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:21,927
with a replacement for oil and natural gas.

634
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:42,251
Natural resources can become depleted

635
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:48,308
but human creativity is inextiguishable

636
01:02:48,442 --> 01:02:54,649
I believe that once oil depletes,
the genious of humankind

637
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:59,505
will invent alternative sources
of nutrition and fuel.

638
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:09,751
The Stone Age ended not
because we ran out of stones,

639
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:15,758
we moved from the horse to the automobile
not because we ran out of hay.

640
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:23,618
I don't dismiss the ingenuity of man.

641
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:29,074
The step that we are embarking
on today is the hybrid electric

642
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:33,480
automobile, which has both an
internal combustion engine

643
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,949
and an electric motor.

644
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:42,557
I drive a Prius car, it gets 45 miles
per gallon, if gas were $10 a gallon

645
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:47,230
I could still fill a tank and go 500
miles on it, and that's not too bad.

646
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:51,635
Well, even if you waved the
magic wand and hybridized

647
01:03:51,652 --> 01:03:54,705
every car on the road right
now, we'd still be consuming

648
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:58,560
the same amount of gasoline that
we are now, in about 5 or 7 years.

649
01:03:58,593 --> 01:04:01,897
Because, again, with each passing
year the economy grows, and we

650
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,867
have to consume more and more oil.

651
01:04:10,374 --> 01:04:14,012
We have very big challenges
to face in this century.

652
01:04:14,045 --> 01:04:17,750
This is a planet that has 6
billion people on it now, perhaps

653
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:20,286
9 billion people by the end of the century.

654
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:24,541
The problem is enormous, 14
terawatts of energy we need

655
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:28,045
by 2050, we need a new
source of that much energy.

656
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:33,218
That's the equivalent of 220
million barrels of oil, per day.

657
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,149
We've got 700 million internal combustion

658
01:04:45,183 --> 01:04:47,953
engines running around
the roads of the world.

659
01:04:47,986 --> 01:04:51,006
Again, we're talking about the scale

660
01:04:51,056 --> 01:04:54,210
and we are thinking about what does it take

661
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,816
to really replace fossil
fuels for transportation.

662
01:04:59,116 --> 01:05:03,121
The big one, of course, which is
hydrogen, that's the one that's gonna

663
01:05:03,221 --> 01:05:07,159
do the trick and replace oil, eventually.

664
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:14,401
Well, the hydrogen economy
is conceptually a good idea.

665
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:18,289
If you look in reality,
it has major challenges.

666
01:05:18,323 --> 01:05:23,746
The problem also for industry is
sort of a chicken and an egg thing.

667
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:28,702
Industry is reluctant to
really invest heavily into

668
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:32,123
fuel cell technology, because
there's no hydrogen infrastructure

669
01:05:32,139 --> 01:05:35,327
to deliver and produce cheaply hydrogen.
On the other hand

670
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:39,481
this infrastructure is not in place
because there's no demand for hydrogen.

671
01:05:39,515 --> 01:05:42,969
So how do you get this started?
And both again

672
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:46,373
need substantial breakthroughs in technology,

673
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:50,545
fuel cell technology, hydrogen
production technology,

674
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:54,116
transportation of hydrogen
and storage of hydrogen,

675
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,269
fundamentally unresolved issues.

676
01:05:56,369 --> 01:06:00,106
The economics right now are
that we use the equivalent

677
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,943
of 3 to 6 gallons of gasoline
to make enough hydrogen to

678
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:06,164
drive a car the same distance that 1
gallon of gasoline would drive it.

679
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:09,234
So, the hydrogen economy at
this point makes no sense.

680
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:13,456
If you talk about hydrogen, it
may take at least 40 years.

681
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:17,978
Easily 30 to 50 years. Easily.

682
01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:40,138
The principal drawback to biomass is
that it's generally pretty inefficient.

683
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:48,097
A couple of pretty respected
scientists in our country believe that

684
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:51,502
if you look at all of the energy
inputs in the producing ethanol

685
01:06:51,535 --> 01:06:56,791
you put more fossil fuel into producing
the ethanol than the energy you get out.

686
01:06:57,108 --> 01:07:01,597
The quantities that could be
made available from ethanol

687
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,851
and biodiesel are very very
small, and would replace

688
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:09,757
only a small percentage of the
fuels that we consume today.

689
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:14,563
Even if you took the biodiesel
production, scaled it up to the maximum,

690
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:18,034
and that scaled that up another ten
times, you're still talking about

691
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:21,788
a drop in the bucket compared
to what we get from oil.

692
01:07:26,577 --> 01:07:32,601
How much of our food acreage are
we gonna convert to growing fuel?

693
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:37,624
How much world hunger can we stand
if that's the fuel of choice?

694
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:54,094
Nuclear energy will be expensive,
and the experience that

695
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:58,649
we have gathered over the last 20, 30,
40 years in terms of safe storage of

696
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:03,138
materials, especially in Europe where
there's much more discussion about

697
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:06,042
how to treat the waste and
what to do with that.

698
01:08:06,058 --> 01:08:09,145
This needs to be rethought.

699
01:08:09,479 --> 01:08:13,400
People are nervous about the
risk of an explosion or a

700
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:19,124
nuclear event of some sort and then
there's a danger of terrorist activity.

701
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:22,307
If you wanted to build enough to replace
all the fossil fuels that we burn

702
01:08:22,345 --> 01:08:26,533
worldwide today, which is 10 terawatts,
you would have to build 10 thousand

703
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,770
of the biggest possible nuclear plants.
And if you did that

704
01:08:29,787 --> 01:08:34,359
and burn U-235 in them, the
worldwide reserves of uranium would

705
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,646
be exhausted in somewhere
between one and two decades.

706
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,833
So, it would be a bridge, at best.

707
01:08:48,743 --> 01:08:52,781
Wind energy is becoming more
popular and economically viable,

708
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,235
but because of its intermittency and
low power density, it will never

709
01:08:56,252 --> 01:09:00,290
contribute more than a small
fraction of our energy supply.

710
01:09:14,741 --> 01:09:21,215
When you talk about wind or solar energy...
these are very small.

711
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:26,889
- Oh, yeah, I see it's started.
- Can we turn that on a little bit more?

712
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,009
- There it goes.
- OK.

713
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:34,515
So here, this is actually artificial light,
but in sunshine it does the same thing,

714
01:09:34,548 --> 01:09:39,721
and so this little machine is converting
light directly into electric power.

715
01:09:39,738 --> 01:09:43,726
It will convert 10 or 12% of sunlight
directly into electric power.

716
01:09:43,776 --> 01:09:48,415
We have the technology right
now, we know how to do it.

717
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:51,702
We wont build big power plants
tomorrow morning, but we know how.

718
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:56,792
It takes a lot of development and so
on, but we know how to do it now.

719
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,370
Total amount of sunlight
that falls on the planet

720
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:09,657
is 20000 times the amount of
fossil fuel power we're using now.

721
01:10:09,674 --> 01:10:12,446
So we are awash in sunlight, there's
plenty of energy from sunlight,

722
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:14,647
we just haven't begun to learn
how to use it properly.

723
01:10:14,697 --> 01:10:19,419
The real barrier to implementing
solar electricity now is its cost.

724
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:29,431
To generate the same amount of
power we now use in fossil fuel

725
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:34,437
you'd have to cover land area roughy half
the size of the state of California.

726
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:40,261
All of the solar cells made in
the world up till now probably

727
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,648
would only cover about 10 square
kilometers, it's a tiny fraction of it, so

728
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:47,953
not impossible, not unthinkable, but
really a huge technological challenge.

729
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:05,625
We've got to look at all
of these sources of energy

730
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:09,596
and if you add them all together,
you must be very optimistic about

731
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:13,250
each of these sources to believe
that we can produce anything like

732
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:17,506
the quantity and quality of energy
that we're getting from fossil fuels.

733
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,273
Our worldwide demand now is
somewhere between 25 and 30

734
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:24,147
billion barrels a year and it's
increasing at an alarming rate.

735
01:11:24,194 --> 01:11:27,398
And that's really where the problem
is, the demand is so huge,

736
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:31,708
there is nothing that we can imagine
to replace oil in those quantities.

737
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:40,425
There are lots of ideas around, and
the ideas are just vapour until

738
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:44,172
somebody actually tries them and
shows that they either work and

739
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:47,122
have side effects or don't have side
effects or don't work or whatever.

740
01:11:47,123 --> 01:11:50,404
That's called research and that's
exactly what we're not doing.

741
01:12:26,807 --> 01:12:30,923
You can't undo where you are, so...

742
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:34,204
Evolution is always forwards,
we're never going backwards, so

743
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:39,154
we will never be back to the
farm because evolution just went

744
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:44,144
into different way, so we basically just
have to adapt to the new conditions.

745
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:49,386
It's very unlikely that once we've run
down the other side of Hubbert's peak

746
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:52,861
that we're going to be able to
maintain the kind of lifestyles

747
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,337
that we're now maintaining.
This oil is so cheap,

748
01:12:56,375 --> 01:13:02,239
it's so readily available, there was just
such an enormous temptation to exploit this

749
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:08,063
and to set up a quality of lifestyle
that will be impossible to maintain.

750
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:15,499
There is something about the
horse that has an appeal

751
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:20,275
that the automobile doesn't. The
horse is a living thing and it's...

752
01:13:20,294 --> 01:13:24,876
Often times between an owner and a horse

753
01:13:24,896 --> 01:13:28,254
a certain amount of affection develops.

754
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:36,272
We're going about 9 miles an hour right now.

755
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:04,812
We had a kind of a trial run for
what would happen when oil peaks.

756
01:14:07,103 --> 01:14:11,277
No gas. - No gasoline? - No.

757
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:15,238
There was a temporary peak in 1973.
Middle East and OPEC countries

758
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:19,859
were angry about the 1973 war in
Israel and they embargoed the oil.

759
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:22,638
And we immediately had panicked
toward the future of our way of life

760
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:25,663
and made mile long lines at gas stations.

761
01:14:44,942 --> 01:14:50,281
In the future, things like driving
cars and air travel period

762
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,037
will be not something that the
average person can afford

763
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:58,028
but something that's only available
to the super-elite, the 1/10 of 1%.

764
01:15:02,823 --> 01:15:05,852
About the graduate student that came
to see me and he said "Tell me,

765
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:08,240
will my grandchildren ever
ride in an airplane?"

766
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:12,822
It was a ripping question because
the answer might very well be "No."

767
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:21,442
And the air travel will essentially stop.

768
01:15:40,138 --> 01:15:44,681
Many people tend to think that it was
money that made the world go round,

769
01:15:44,781 --> 01:15:48,215
when in reality it was the underlying supply

770
01:15:48,234 --> 01:15:50,758
of cheap energy, much of it coming from oil.

771
01:15:50,858 --> 01:15:54,389
You end up with asking "What is more
real, is it the financial market,

772
01:15:54,408 --> 01:15:57,534
or is it the oil supply in the ground?"

773
01:15:57,689 --> 01:16:00,503
And everybody will come to the
conclusion what is more real,

774
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:04,795
is the oil supply in the ground. The
financial system is a system full of

775
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:09,086
petrodollars and if you take
them out it's bound to shrink.

776
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:17,822
There isn't a company quoted
on the stock exchange

777
01:16:17,922 --> 01:16:23,064
that doesn't tacitly assume a business
as usual supply of cheap oil.

778
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:26,617
Well, that isn't there anymore, that
means that virtually every company

779
01:16:26,656 --> 01:16:31,238
is overvalued on the stock exchange.
And as the financial community

780
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:35,585
recognizes this, well that might
trigger some kind of overreaction

781
01:16:35,586 --> 01:16:39,586
and stock market collapse.
I think it's very likely.

782
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:46,632
I wouldn't be surprised, personally,
if it doesn't trigger another

783
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:51,099
Great Depression comparable to the
one of the 1930s if not worse,

784
01:16:51,118 --> 01:16:56,923
because this one is imposed by nature
rather than being a speculative bubble.

785
01:16:57,023 --> 01:17:02,845
I've taken this timespan here from 5000
years ago to 5000 years in the future.

786
01:17:02,942 --> 01:17:06,611
What we call recorded history
began about 5000 years ago.

787
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:14,711
So, what this shows is that this spike
here is the episode of the fossil fuels,

788
01:17:14,882 --> 01:17:19,852
coal, oil and natural gas, and every other
kind of fossil fuel in human history.

789
01:17:19,871 --> 01:17:22,671
It's the most disturbing thing that's
ever happened to human species.

790
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:25,055
It's responsible for our
technological society and

791
01:17:25,094 --> 01:17:29,132
and in terms of human history
is a very brief epoch.

792
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:47,557
At the time of Christ there were about
300 million people on the planet.

793
01:17:47,615 --> 01:17:53,109
Which had about doubled by the end
of 18th century, when coal came on,

794
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:58,798
then came good old oil and suddenly
the population went up 6 times.

795
01:18:05,593 --> 01:18:09,398
I don't think that we could sustain
the present population of the globe,

796
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,883
much less what it will be in 20 or 30 years,

797
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:13,980
without the use of petrochemicals.

798
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:17,009
Does it mean we have got
to go back to a population

799
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:20,426
not much different than
what it was before oil?

800
01:18:27,997 --> 01:18:32,909
In the absence of fossil fuels, how
many people can the world support?

801
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:37,802
Many people believe maybe
1.5, 2 billion people.

802
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:46,888
You don't often hope you're
wrong, I really hope I'm wrong,

803
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:50,654
everybody I know who's concerned
about peak oil hopes they're wrong.

804
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:54,363
I don't think I'm wrong, I
don't think they're wrong.

805
01:19:15,777 --> 01:19:20,416
We are facing some sort of
unprecedented, unparallaled situation,

806
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:25,503
and that explains why it is so
difficult for one to really

807
01:19:25,562 --> 01:19:29,192
accept it, one thinks there's
got to be a solution.

808
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:36,687
It's somehow contrary to our mindset
to think about these things,

809
01:19:36,725 --> 01:19:40,005
we just don't like to do it, we've
gotten used to the filling station

810
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:42,724
that has been there for as
long as we can remember, and

811
01:19:42,802 --> 01:19:45,850
normal people say "Well it's
gonna be there into the future."

812
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:52,276
It's very hard. And it's doubly hard because
it really has never happened before.

813
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:58,275
It's a strange issue of mindset and
attitude and experience and behaviour that

814
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:02,255
somehow leaves us so
unprepared for this situation.

815
01:20:03,634 --> 01:20:07,865
We identify as species called
hydrocarbon mammal who lives

816
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:12,390
on the strength of all of this oil,
well his days are definitely numbered.

817
01:20:12,817 --> 01:20:17,574
Whether modern kind of homo
sapiens as a species altogether

818
01:20:17,632 --> 01:20:21,282
will carry on living some
different, simple way,

819
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,864
that's another question.

820
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:41,822
Right now we don't have the kind of
political leadership, not only we in US,

821
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:45,803
the whole world doesn't have the kind of
political leadership that would make us

822
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:49,802
aware of this problem and
do something about it.

823
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:56,054
There's little hope for the
politicians taking the lead in this

824
01:20:56,154 --> 01:20:59,509
'couse it's difficult in
government for people to...

825
01:20:59,548 --> 01:21:03,354
It's much easier for a politician to
react to a crisis when it's happened,

826
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:05,975
than to take steps to prepare for it.

827
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:11,760
It's only about the public that calls their
representatives and Congress and says

828
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:16,361
"You must do something and we
are prepared to support you

829
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,816
in whatever you'll take." You
don't have those telephone calls

830
01:21:19,817 --> 01:21:22,457
being made today.

831
01:21:23,305 --> 01:21:29,661
