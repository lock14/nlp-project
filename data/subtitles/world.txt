1
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,910
I love you.

2
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,586
I'll kill you.

3
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:41,037
The reason why a generation seems confusing
is because the viewer's mentality itself is in chaos.
-Jean Cocteau-

4
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:12,989
You bitch.

5
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:45,956
Don't make a fool of me!

6
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:49,960
You asshole!

7
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,477
I'll kill you.

8
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:56,268
Last night at 2AM

9
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,604
3 persons were found dead in a convenience store in Northern Saitama.

10
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:03,609
The victims were cashier Kawamoto Hitoshi-san,

11
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:07,111
a worker who lived nearby, Yasuda Ayaka-san,

12
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,032
and photography student Koyama Junpei-san.

13
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,951
All 3 bodies had knife wounds.

14
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:18,748
The police was alarmed but when they arrived at the scene,

15
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,627
the victims were already dead.

16
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,546
Fujishima Akikazu...

17
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:30,343
It's been 5 days and the police are still investigating.

18
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,721
No clue for a suspect has been found so far.

19
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,682
Ex-Police Lieutenant of Omiya North Department,

20
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,269
retired January of this year.

21
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,689
He was rather fired, wasn't he?

22
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,570
Now working as a security patrol.

23
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,956
Is there anything else

24
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:02,001
that you remember about the case?

25
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:05,628
Nothing at all.

26
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,588
I heard he lost everything.

27
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:10,800
His house, his daughter, his wife.

28
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,307
Maybe he's the one who committed this crazy murder.

29
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,266
(Schizophrenia/Manic Depression?)

30
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,810
How are you doing?

31
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,646
You're taking your medication, right?

32
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:28,192
One more beer!

33
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:28,985
Okay.

34
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,939
Are you ill?

35
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,579
He lost his job and family at that age.

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,752
This is the weapon that was used.

37
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,422
Fujishima-san?

38
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,593
I did it.

39
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,014
I killed these three people.

40
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,853
That's what you think, right?

41
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,355
You stink!

42
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,607
Shut up!

43
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,975
Senpai!

44
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,550
Take a look at these.

45
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,266
Have you seen one of them?

46
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,893
All I saw were corpses.

47
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,605
How is your family doing?

48
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,778
Your daughter is in high school now, right?

49
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,156
None of your business.

50
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:01,911
Don't touch me!

51
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,663
Let go of me!

52
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,709
Shut up, asshole!

53
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,644
(3 persons stabbed in a convenience store in Omiya)

(The madness that destroyed a young man's dreams)

55
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,139
Do you sleep properly at night?

56
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,867
Do you dream?

57
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,122
I'm so glad you picked up.

58
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,201
Sorry to bother you.
Were you asleep?

59
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,497
But I have to talk with you.

60
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,750
It's about Kanako.

61
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:54,882
I thought maybe she was over at your place.

62
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,800
Please, do not hide her.

63
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,302
Why would Kanako be here?

64
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:02,348
She hasn't come home for several days

65
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,266
and I can't contact her at all.

66
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,684
So...

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,521
tell me the truth. Are you ...

68
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,731
You think I kidnapped Kanako?

69
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:13,567
No, that's not what I mean.

70
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:14,567
Bullshit!

71
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:15,819
Kanako is...

72
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:17,696
You piece of shit!

73
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,590
(Kiriko)

74
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,425
You have no dreams?

75
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,797
Dreams?

76
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,312

Sponsored by Narita Homes

78
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,026
Such a thing...

79
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:27,201
Come in.

80
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,668
Can I?

81
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,703
Have you called the police?

82
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,380
It's too early for that.

83
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,096
Take a look at Kanako's room.

84
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:52,100
Go and you might know what's going on!

85
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,261
Maybe I'm wrong.

86
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,440
Her bag!

87
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:40,356
What's with her bag?
It's all normal stuff.

88
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,817
There's nothing.

89
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,849
Isn't that ...

90
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,736
Oi!

91
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,999
How long has she been gone?

92
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,335
Five or six days.

93
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,048
Have you contacted her friends?

94
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,984
No, I don't know anyone of them.

95
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:51,720
What is this?

96
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,683
Neurology?

97
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,769
What!? She told me she was going to the dentist.

98
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,873
Did she have a part-time job?

99
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,859
There were expensive clothes in her closet.

100
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,653
No, I dont think so.

101
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,990
Who is this? Her boyfriend?

102
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:14,868
I have no idea.

103
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,203
You don't know anything, do you!

104
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,373
Don't act so high and mighty!

105
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:21,792
Do you even remember her face!

106
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,376
Did she lose weight?

107
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,046
Did you pay attention to her appetite and her eyes?

108
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,338
Drug addicts usually get thin.

109
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,216
There's no way she would do such a thing!

110
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:30,801
She is our daughter!

111
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,393
"Our"?

112
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:49,610
So...

113
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,823
What shall we do?

114
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,659
I'll find her.

115
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,328
You won't.
I better call the police.

116
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,373
What will happen to Kanako if you call the police!

117
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:02,875
After all, someone like you can't...

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,875
Calm down,

119
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,835
Idiot!

120
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,837
You think you can give yourself airs, right?

121
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,006
It's none of your business anymore!

122
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,135
Don't touch me!

123
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,683
Why can't people live in the water?

124
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,854
It's so peaceful here,

125
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:28,149
whereas over there is hell.

126
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:35,240
Why am I a human?

127
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,080
These hands and feet,

128
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,206
eyes, mouth, and ears,

129
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,042
my hair,

130
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,878
my nose that's bigger than other people's,

131
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:51,090
I don't want any of this.

132
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:55,385
The kiss Hiromi-kun gave me changed my world.

133
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,557
If I'm only gonna get hurt, I don't want even my heart.

134
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,893
I'm definitely

135
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,273
not cut out to be a human.

136
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,778
Probably, he wasn't too.

137
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,995
Damn it...

138
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:24,748
Damn it!

139
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:44,475
Were you crying?

140
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:45,601
Fujishima...

141
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:47,095
No...

142
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:50,524
It was pretty obvious.

143
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,317
Fujishima Kanako,

144
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:58,323
the one and only beautiful creature on Earth.

145
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,326
What's wrong with your face?

146
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:02,995
Come on.

147
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:04,580
Here you go.

148
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:08,458
My eyes, mouth, ears, and nose

149
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,793
all exist in order to feel you.

150
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:14,089
- My hands
- No, keep it.

151
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,798
exist in order to touch you.

152
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,344
And my feet

153
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,427
Kanako!

154
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:21,764
See you!

155
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:23,974
exist in order to follow you.

156
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,854
The reason why I'm still willing to be human

157
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:32,566
is definitely because you're in this world.

158
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,519
That's how it is,

159
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:38,655
Fujishima.

160
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,577
We already told everything we know to her mother.

161
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,788
Then tell it to me in detail one more time.

162
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,956
As I said, we were aiming to go to a private university.

163
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,709
Kanako wanted to go to a national university,

164
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,586
so we only have morning classes together.

165
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:56,215
What happened after that?

166
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,427
I called her in the evening but she didn't pick up.

167
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,346
Do you have any idea where she could have gone?

168
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,515
Like some guy's place?

169
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,351
Is it this guy?

170
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,812
Who is this?
Do you know him?

171
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,149
She can't be contacted for several days now.

172
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:16,360
As her friends, shouldn't you be a little worried?

173
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,528
Friends?

174
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,488
Well, you could say we are friends.

175
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:22,073
But isn't this fairly normal?

176
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,783
We don't constantly contact our parents.

177
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,369
She's different from you.

178
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,037
What?

179
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:31,417
Say, do you really know Kanako?

180
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,428
Did she have a part-time job?

181
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:44,488
No idea.

182
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:45,681
Can we go now?

183
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,932
You easily get thirsty when you're addicted to drugs, right?

184
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,104
What is this?

185
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,105
You know that, don't you?

186
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,498
What do you want?

187
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,265
Don't get mad.

188
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,777
I just want to find my daughter.

189
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,904
If you tell me everything you know, you can keep it.

190
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,490
Don't give that to us!

191
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,534
You guys don't look like proper high school students.

192
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,452
We have nothing more to say.

193
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,957
Let go!
You're a nuisance!

194
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:27,138
I prescribed anti-anxiety pills and light sleeping pills

195
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,682
Your daughter has no real problems.

196
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,268
She is intelligent.

197
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,022
No smoking please.

198
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,194
But she wouldn't come without a problem.

199
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,072
We're in a hurry to find her.

200
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:46,741
What were the symptoms she was having?

201
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:49,243
Sleeplessness, irritations,

202
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,913
attacks of sweating,

203
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,457
subconsciously reaching for a cigarette, things like that.

204
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,584
Would you like me to prescribe you a medication?

205
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,794
No, I'm alright.

206
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,963
Then, was there anything she was worried about?

207
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,258
Apparently there were some family problems.

208
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,752
You know about her parents' divorce, don't you?

209
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,971
Can you give me her medical records?

210
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,140
Her father's occupation was also...

211
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:12,851
You have her medical records, don't you?

212
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,686
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:18,231
We cannot disclose a patient's privacy.

214
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,025
Not even to the police.

215
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:23,362
That shitty doctor!

216
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:29,993
I have my own medicine!

217
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,294
What is it!

218
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:41,904
What's the matter?

219
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:46,343
I was able to contact Kanako's friends from middle school.

220
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,346
Wow! I was so fat!

221
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,349
It's been so long!

222
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,269
You know Kanako, right?

223
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:57,104
Were you guys together in elementary or middle school?

224
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:57,938
Ah, yeah.

225
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,272
What kind of person was she?

226
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,982
Her personality? Super good!

227
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,027
She was serious and clever.

228
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,862
I heard this guy switched jobs again!

229
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,657
Do you know him?

230
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,076
Who is this?

231
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,778
Oh, he committed suicide when we were in 8th grade.

232
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:15,497
Suicide?

233
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,414
Ogata!

234
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,249
Right, Ogata, Ogata!

235
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,334
Were they dating?

236
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,585
No way!

237
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:22,587
It's Ogata!
He was lame and bullied all the time.

238
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,048
Who would want to go out with him!

239
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:26,215
Right, but at his funeral...

240
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,511
I'll order pizza.

241
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,263
They also were Kanako's friends.

242
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,349
Really? You treat us?

243
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:35,683
Great.

244
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:38,519
Did Kanako and Ogata get along well?

245
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:41,022
Kanako got along with everyone.

246
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,941
She has a lot of charisma.

247
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,777
Ogata must've taken it the wrong way.

248
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:46,528
He thought he was Kanako's only one.

249
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,781
That's so true!
There were many boys who thought that.

250
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,450
Well, it wasn't just boys.

251
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:54,202
Remember that ugly...

252
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,372
Endo Nami!

253
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,423
She was a drug dealer, wasn't she?

254
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,291
Yeah.

255
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,836
Which one's the drug dealer?

256
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,546
This one! Endo Nami.

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,458
- What about him?
- Matsunaga?

258
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,881
That's Matsunaga!

259
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,353
He's scary!

260
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,188
He's totally crazy.

261
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,731
I suddenly really wanna go to karaoke!

262
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:25,741
- Is karaoke okay?
- Wait until we've finished eating!

263
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,909
I wonder what kind of person that girl was.

264
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,997
Don't think about it, just eat.

265
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,287
It must be a prank.

266
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:47,881
She wants us to worry about her.

267
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:51,343
It's because we left her alone all the time.

268
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,510
That's why...

269
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,162
Why can't people fly?

270
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:22,499
Stop squirming!

271
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,211
And why did he fly nonetheless?

272
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,252
Where has the person I was in those days gone?

273
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:48,317
Playing tug-of-war with these idiots for this tiny place on Earth.

274
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,322
Die!

275
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,576
Okay, let him go.

276
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,147
What's wrong?

277
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,718
You asshole!

278
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:10,588
Shut up, you piece of shit.

279
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,598
Once again, you came to my rescue.

280
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,300
No.

281
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,853
I just wanted it to be quiet.

282
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:28,898
Because this is his and my special place.

283
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,792
His...

284
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,769
Ogata's?

285
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:58,721
Wanna drink?

286
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,567
Here is where I first met him.

287
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:05,519
Is this Sake?!

288
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,222
I was alone, and he came here to be alone too.

289
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,282
He looked at me and said,

290
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,769
"You want to disappear too, right?"

291
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:18,990
Disappear...

292
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,584
Wasn't it cruel?

293
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:22,744
Leaving me here alone.

294
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:25,330
Doing this on his own.

295
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,151
Fujishima!

296
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:32,996
What?

297
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,592
Like Ogata...

298
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,520
You thought I was going to jump off like him?

299
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,222
No...

300
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:45,851
Fool.

301
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:53,517
Can't I become like Ogata?

302
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:57,244
What are you talking about?

303
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,891
I don't get it.

304
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:06,630
That's funny.

305
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,288
You're really weird.

306
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:36,785
Shit.

307
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,115
It's embarassing, but

308
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:45,411
I've always been working day and night

309
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:50,039
so I know next to nothing about my daughter.

310
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:54,752
So you come here to ask her old teacher?

311
00:24:56,212 --> 00:25:01,676
Yes.
Well, it's a bit late, but ...

312
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,053
But?

313
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:05,096
Nothing.

314
00:25:06,557 --> 00:25:07,891
I understand how you feel.

315
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:12,104
I have a young daughter myself.

316
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:18,402
Sometimes I have no clue what she's thinking.

317
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:21,404
Is Kanako-san doing well?

318
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:23,240
Yes.

319
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,078
At that time, she

320
00:25:29,913 --> 00:25:34,084
now and then seemed to be considering suicide.

321
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,420
As if...

322
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:37,962
What?

323
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:42,384
As if she thought it was her responsibility.

324
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:47,681
As if she had driven Ogata-kun to his death.

325
00:25:51,393 --> 00:25:52,626
Specific details?

326
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:57,482
Long-term absenteeism, pale looks,

327
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,442
weight loss...

328
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,486
Drug use!

329
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,780
So, was it drugs?

330
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,950
And these kids ...

331
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:10,078
Did she hang around with these pupils?

332
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,997
Kanako!

333
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:22,132
I'm sorry that I did not report it to you.

334
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,550
But,

335
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,640
I could not believe it back then.

336
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:34,686
Where are they now?

337
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,941
Endo Nami passed away last year.

338
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:44,113
In the end, she died of drug abuse.

339
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:45,948
Of course.

340
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,910
It's only natural that such a piece of junk dies.

341
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,037
It all makes sense now.

342
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:54,580
These assholes passed drugs to her.

343
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,710
The school knew, but didn't take action.

344
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,002
That is not true.

345
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:00,703
What is not true!

346
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:04,599
Are you trying to make excuses?

347
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,974
Hey, Senpai.
Did you remember anything?

348
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:15,352
That picture you showed me last time...

349
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:18,063
That paled faced guy with piercings...

350
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,064
Ah, yes, yes.

351
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:20,857
Who is he?

352
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:22,067
Well, it seems

353
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:26,446
he belongs to a gang to which the murdered Koyama had connections.

354
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:29,115
Tell me everything.
What's his name?

355
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,410
The one with piercings.

356
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:32,911
His name?

357
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,554
It's Matsunaga Yasuhiro.

358
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,383
So it was that Matsunaga

359
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:48,218
who gave the drugs to Kanako.

360
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,362
That piece of shit!

361
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:52,998
It's hot in here!

362
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:58,269
He sells drugs for a gang called Nishimaru.

363
00:27:58,354 --> 00:27:59,528
Really?

364
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,857
He's the one who depraved Kanako.

365
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:04,977
It's all his fault.

366
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:06,811
I even know his home address.

367
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:08,372
Don't worry.

368
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:12,867
Once we've caught this guy, we'll find Kanako right away.

369
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,310
Are you happy?

370
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,082
Now that you know that Kanako takes drugs.

371
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,835
Don't talk nonsense!
Why should I?

372
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:24,630
But your face is smiling.

373
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:50,572
Are you crazy?

374
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,574
I'll find Kanako, so...

375
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,535
What are you talking about!
What are you doing?

376
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:56,703
Our daughter is missing!
How dare you!

377
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,538
I want to start over.

378
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:03,251
Get out!

379
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:05,253
Can you find Kanako by yourself?

380
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:08,882
What's that supposed to mean?
If I don't let you touch me, I won't find her?

381
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,183
Do you have the nerves to say that?

382
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:10,884
I have.

383
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,804
Actually, you don't give a shit about Kanako!

384
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,993
You don't care about Kanako either.

385
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,354
Let go of me!

386
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,845
Get lost!

387
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,337
Stop it!

388
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,192
Don't!

389
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,436
It happened because you were with that guy!

390
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,701
You left your daughter alone

391
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:21,997
for that baldie!

392
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:30,798
Stop it!

393
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:36,886
Go die, you lunatic.

394
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:41,099
Stop kidding me!

395
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:42,267
I love you.

396
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,301
Stop it!

397
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,352
Make breakfast.

398
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:31,482
I'll stay here.

399
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,067
Then, I'll move out.

400
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:35,820
This is my home.

401
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,906
I will protect you and Kanako.

402
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:41,617
You have the nerve to say this shit?

403
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:45,998
Because I love you.

404
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:49,751
What kind of joke is that?

405
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,086
Something's wrong with your brain!

406
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:54,131
Shut up and make breakfast!

407
00:31:59,345 --> 00:31:59,886
Kanako...

408
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,096
Leave her alone too.

409
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,766
She has long forgotten about you.

410
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:14,768
Shit.

411
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:18,855
Then I'll make her remember.

412
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:23,359
She is my daughter!

413
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,376
What's wrong with that?

414
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:32,877
Get out, you psycho!

415
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,674
I'll kill you, you piece of shit!

416
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:44,222
What's wrong with me loving my family?

417
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:50,186
One morning, when I opened my eyes,

418
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:53,816
my world had changed.

419
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,904
It seemed just like magic.

420
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:36,692
Are you okay?

421
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,611
That was mean of you.

422
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:42,114
I'm not afraid of that guy.

423
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,656
That guy?

424
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,285
Don't play dumb!
I'm talking about Matsunaga!

425
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:49,288
He and his gang...

426
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:51,999
It was you, wasn't it!

427
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:53,459
I have nothing to do with it.

428
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,295
I've never spoken with Matsunaga.

429
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,509
You quit baseball

430
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,596
to hang out with such guys?

431
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:08,474
What do you mean?
You're wrong!

432
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,059
Then, why?

433
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:12,561
Why did you quit so suddenly?

434
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,681
Because I realized

435
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:20,402
I'm not made for chasing baseballs.

436
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:27,742
My position is not right-fielder No 8.

437
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,793
There was no special reason.

438
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,085
What did you say!

439
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,954
Sensei, Shimazu hit him!

440
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,048
Shimazu hit him!

441
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:43,675
Sensei!

442
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,681
Matsunaga sends his compliments.

443
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:57,271
My world changed like by magic.

444
00:34:58,273 --> 00:34:59,900
And the one who casted this magic spell

445
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,193
certainly was...
(Alice in Wonderland)

446
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:16,583
Don't play dumb with me, you old bitch!

447
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,793
Matsunaga Yasuhiro is your son!

448
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:20,753
That guy is not my son.

449
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,882
Who are you?

450
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,010
I'm from the police of Omiya Police Department!

451
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,302
Where is he?

452
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:28,052
Who knows?

453
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:29,512
Don't play dumb.

454
00:35:29,512 --> 00:35:31,681
Do you understand what your son has done!

455
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:32,849
That has nothing to do with me!

456
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:34,384
You're his mother!

457
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,813
I don't care about that piece of garbage.

458
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:40,481
That's right, your son is garbage.

459
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,860
Because you are garbage yourself!

460
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,322
Parents must take responsibility!

461
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:51,784
Take the responsibility and kill your son!

462
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:57,206
What are you saying?

463
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:24,568
Hey, you!

464
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,706
Hey, who are you?

465
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:51,260
It reaks of old man in here.

466
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:41,936
Senpai!

467
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:47,650
Are you alright?

468
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,737
Your skull isn't broken?

469
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,221
- Shut up!
- You're scary.

470
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,239
Who are these guys?

471
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,782
Why are you here?

472
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,601
I was taking a stroll.

473
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,862
Did something happen to your daughter?

474
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:02,141
Kanako-san was her name, correct?

475
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,760
She had connections with Matsunaga, right?

476
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,878
You answer my question!

477
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:10,548
Okay, okay.
The truth is, Matsunaga is chased by

478
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:13,302
his own gang and the Ishimaru group.

479
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:18,891
You just unfortunately happened to get involved in the fight.

480
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:20,601
What did he do?

481
00:38:20,684 --> 00:38:23,186
Who knows what stupid kids do?

482
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:27,190
But the murder victim Koyama Junpei

483
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,025
was Matsunaga's senpai

484
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:31,253
and an ex-member of the same gang.

485
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:33,489
Matsunaga has a connection to that case?

486
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,199
There is a connection... probably.

487
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:44,666
Did one of them hit you?

488
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:57,721
Well, it's hard for you too, Senpai.

489
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:02,601
Your wife just moved out of her apartment.

490
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:05,686
I bet it was because you came back.
Right?

491
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:07,523
Are you observing me?

492
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,023
Well, sort of.

493
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:11,860
After all, you are a witness for the convenience store murder.

494
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,418
Kiriko! What are you up to?

495
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,463
I was about to ask the same thing.

496
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:34,173
Oh, Father-in-Law...

497
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:36,927
Where is Kanako?
Where are you hiding her?

498
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,931
Huh?
I'm hiding her?

499
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:42,016
Don't play dumb.

500
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,809
Kiriko told me everything.

501
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:46,894
I know you are hiding Kanako.

502
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,364
Stop talking nonsense.
Why would I hide her?

503
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:52,860
It's a misunderstanding.

504
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:54,360
Please put Kiriko on the phone.

505
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,237
What's wrong with you?

506
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:57,864
Do you think by kidnapping Kanako

507
00:39:57,905 --> 00:39:59,867
you can make everything alright again?

508
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:00,659
You're crazy.

509
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:03,911
I said put Kiriko on the phone!
I have to talk to her!

510
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,539
Give Kanako back at once.

511
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:08,291
Give her back?

512
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:11,461
She is my daughter.

513
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:12,755
Kiriko's and my daughter!

514
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:16,550
Kiriko and Kanako have nothing to do with you anymore.

515
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:21,304
You were the bastard who engaged a lawyer and disbanded our family!

516
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,431
I will report it to the police.

517
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:26,434
Just do it!

518
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,686
It's you who's gonna be humiliated!

519
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,775
Where is she?

520
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,536
I said I didn't know where Kanako is.

521
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:47,623
No, I am asking where that skinny friend of yours is!

522
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:49,132
Who?

523
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,867
Nagano?

524
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:53,170
I don't understand what you mean.

525
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:58,007
Don't play dumb, you ugly bitch!

526
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,300
Hey!

527
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:03,054
Listen to me.
I don't give a shit what happens to you.

528
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:04,139
But my daughter...

529
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:05,516
Let go of me!
Let me!

530
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,108
I only want Kanako.

531
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,148
Kanako...

532
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:19,822
Your daughter did it!
She sold drugs to Nagano and ruined her.

533
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:25,869
She scammed her, threatened her, drove her into prostitution.

534
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:28,539
It was all Kanako's doing!

535
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:33,043
Don't act so fucking high and mighty when you don't know anything!

536
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:35,878
I have to find her.

537
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,340
I want her to...

538
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,800
None of my business!

539
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:43,554
I wish she'd die!

540
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,028
Do you want something?

541
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:01,612
No.

542
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:06,284
It's just that my situation changed recently.

543
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:10,706
It's you who told Matsunaga, right?

544
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,166
That's right.

545
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:16,295
Do you want to go with me?

546
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,465
It's okay.
No one is home.

547
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,521
Where are your parents?

548
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:30,516
My dad has run away,

549
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:32,894
and my mom is having an affair.

550
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,233
I'm all alone and I'm... kind of falling.

551
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,726
What does that mean?

552
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:45,032
If the hole you fall into is too deep,
you keep falling and falling.

553
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:46,867
It's a tale about such a girl.

554
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,077
(Alice in Wonderland)

555
00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:53,289
Did you have trouble?
Because of Matsunaga?

556
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:56,876
No, I'm just a little surprised.

557
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,588
I had not expected you'd know Matsunaga.

558
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:02,548
I thought you had nothing to do with such people.

559
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:04,927
Do you want to meet Matsunaga?

560
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,179
There's a party tomorrow.

561
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:12,351
But I don't know him that well...

562
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:13,936
Me neither.

563
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:17,106
We just occasionally hang out.

564
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:20,108
When I'm all alone.

565
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,777
I feel weak

566
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:24,947
when I'm alone.

567
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,750
You want to disappear?

568
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,956
By the way, you speak like Ogata.

569
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,001
You resemble him.

570
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:45,342
You said you wanted to become like Ogata, right?

571
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,175
Then I want you to learn more and more about me.

572
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,856
I also would like to learn

573
00:44:00,065 --> 00:44:03,235
more and more about you.

574
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:15,581
I guess I'll go... to the party.

575
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:20,978
Fujishima.

576
00:44:32,264 --> 00:44:34,224
Hey! Have you drunk alcohol?

577
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:35,768
None of your business.

578
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,019
I'm a cop.
Aren't you guys minors?

579
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:44,777
- What are you doing out so late?
- Let go of me!

580
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:48,197
Have you ever thought about how much your parents worry?

581
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,782
Okay, I get it!

582
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:50,949
No, you don't!

583
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,867
How much I worry

584
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:58,206
as a father.

585
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:00,291
Where are we here?

586
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,876
Damn it!

587
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,088
Kanako!

588
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:05,588
Who is that?

589
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:11,637
Hey, pay me some...

590
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:19,186
What's going on here?

591
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:34,909
Where are the things your daughter hid?

592
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,452
Stop it.

593
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:38,871
They're in her bag.

594
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,583
We're not looking for drugs.

595
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,878
Then, what is it?
Who are you guys?

596
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:57,016
It seems you don't know how much trouble your daughter has caused.

597
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:00,686
I have no idea what that little bitch did!

598
00:46:00,768 --> 00:46:03,981
Yes, your daughter is shit.

599
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:08,693
It proves that she's related to garbage like you.

600
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,032
Garbage...

601
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:16,201
Stop it!

602
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:18,704
spreads its stench everywhere.

603
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:22,708
Garbage... destroys innocence

604
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:23,990
and purity!

605
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,880
That's why I'll kill you.

606
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:39,807
I'll let you taste the death of your daughter first.

607
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:42,353
And then it's your turn.

608
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:45,313
I have nothing to do with this!

609
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:52,612
I have even forgotten her face!

610
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:56,532
Then smell this and remember.

611
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:02,456
The smell of the garbage

612
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,543
that you produced.

613
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:51,023
Wait a moment!

614
00:48:52,775 --> 00:48:55,777
Go away.
You said you didn't want anything to do with this.

615
00:48:56,277 --> 00:49:00,282
Yeah, but Nagano insisted on giving you this.

616
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:04,119
This is the key to a locker box
next to the North exit of the train station.

617
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:06,579
Take it!

618
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:07,998
Who cares, bitch!

619
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,208
Get lost!

620
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:15,172
It's your responsibility as parent!

621
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,300
What did you say?

622
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:24,139
This is the key that Kanako entrusted to Nagano.

623
00:49:54,545 --> 00:49:55,603
Matsunaga.

624
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:08,474
I really don't know anything!

625
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:10,018
Then get lost!

626
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:14,356
Nagano...

627
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,481
None of my business!

628
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:17,735
I have nothing to do with your drug addicted friend.

629
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:24,742
Don't touch me!

630
00:50:34,293 --> 00:50:36,619
Nagano is a total nervous wreck.

631
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:40,940
She's frightened, terrified.

632
00:50:42,384 --> 00:50:43,802
Tell me in detail.

633
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:46,639
But I don't know any details!

634
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:49,057
She didn't tell me anything!

635
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:52,936
I told her to go to the police if she's so much in danger.

636
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,480
Since when has she been afraid?

637
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:57,440
Since

638
00:50:58,275 --> 00:50:59,525
this happened.

639
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:07,909
After he was killed,

640
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:10,704
each time when she saw the news

641
00:51:11,956 --> 00:51:14,208
she said she might get killed too.

642
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,333
Who killed him?

643
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,327
How should I know!

644
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,972
But,

645
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:22,708
I guess it's

646
00:51:26,094 --> 00:51:27,221
Kanako.

647
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:39,148
Nagano has always adored Kanako.

648
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:42,777
She's like a goddess to her.

649
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:47,240
She did whatever Kanako told her to do.

650
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:50,034
She was even forced into prostitution.

651
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:53,998
Even so, she still loved her.

652
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:01,463
Kanako is really beautiful.

653
00:52:04,675 --> 00:52:05,634
But,

654
00:52:08,344 --> 00:52:10,681
she is a total lunatic.

655
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:14,893
Let me meet Nagano right now.

656
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,353
Nagano doesn't want to see you.

657
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:18,396
I don't give a shit about what she wants!

658
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:18,981
But...

659
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:20,733
You want to save her, don't you?

660
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:21,983
Nagano.

661
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:24,193
Can this car even drive?

662
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:45,998
I love you.

663
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,550
Follow me.

664
00:53:51,782 --> 00:53:52,992
Don't come!

665
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:12,177
Alice.

666
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:36,135
Senpai,

667
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:39,222
you leave a girl alone and run away.

668
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:41,224
Isn't that rude?

669
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:44,894
Can I speak with you?

670
00:55:46,405 --> 00:55:47,800
Let's meet and talk.

671
00:55:47,773 --> 00:55:50,858
Shut up!
How often do you want to do this yet?

672
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:55,313
Piece of shit.

673
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:00,360
Fujishima.

674
00:56:12,213 --> 00:56:17,969
Where are you taking me?

675
00:57:24,994 --> 00:57:26,121
This guy is...

676
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,835
Damn.

677
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:36,215
Damn!

678
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,637
Damn!

679
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:48,184
You want to become like Ogata, right?

680
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:26,056
All this

681
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:30,059
seems to occur in a different world.

682
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:36,065
My mother's voice

683
00:58:37,943 --> 00:58:39,945
seems like it's in another language.

684
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:47,577
I can't understand a word of what she's saying.

685
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,989
Shut up!

686
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:54,835
Is this also a magic spell

687
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:00,298
that you

688
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,510
casted on me,

689
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,478
Fujishima?

690
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:32,039
Senpai, you said we should meet and now you back down?

691
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,447
Under the table.

692
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:50,516
The guy with glasses in a sailor suit,

693
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:55,561
that's Misawa from the Department, right?

694
00:59:55,646 --> 00:59:57,773
Not quite right. It's Officer Miura.

695
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,525
Where did you get such things?

696
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,653
Did he cause this, this killing?

697
01:00:04,153 --> 01:00:05,114
What do you mean?

698
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:07,740
Nagano's cellphone memory.

699
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,827
Listen, you can't tamper with evidence as you please.

700
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:14,414
The last call Nagano made was to Omiya North Police Department.

701
01:00:14,498 --> 01:00:15,373
What?!

702
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:16,458
Don't play dumb!

703
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,836
She called the police, yet she was killed. Why is that?

704
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:22,213
We're still investigating.
We don't know yet.

705
01:00:22,213 --> 01:00:24,675
Just admit it. It was the police who killed her.

706
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:26,210
Who did it? Was it you?

707
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,469
Perhaps it was you, Senpai.

708
01:00:27,677 --> 01:00:28,846
What are you up to?

709
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:29,722
Nothing.

710
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:32,516
We just want to solve this case calmly.

711
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:33,858
Where is Kanako?

712
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,936
Do you really not know?

713
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:37,563
Then, how about we cooperate?

714
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,065
Who would want to cooperate with you!

715
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:42,775
Can't you give me those photos?

716
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,027
Shut up!

717
01:00:44,527 --> 01:00:47,697
Don't get in my way if you want them, you assholes!

718
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:51,117
Don't get in our way too, old man.

719
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,081
Please. Surrender us the photos.

720
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:59,376
Would you kneel down and lick my ass?

721
01:00:59,835 --> 01:01:03,047
We have our own rules.

722
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:06,916
And we have the power to enforce them.

723
01:01:14,766 --> 01:01:17,728
Senpai, you should know.

724
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,938
There's nothing you can do after quitting your job.

725
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,121
Fujishima.

726
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,677
Because of your magic spell

727
01:01:45,088 --> 01:01:49,885
I begin to become someone else.

728
01:02:13,617 --> 01:02:15,869
Do you like kids with runny noses?

729
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:22,751
Is fucking girls dressed up in doll clothes

730
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,170
a hobby of yours?

731
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,088
What are you?

732
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:30,092
What are you, bastard!

733
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:37,382
Fujishima.

734
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,851
Fujishima.

735
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:41,936
Kanako!

736
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:44,155
Fujishima.

737
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:58,161
Hey, do you realize how stupid you are?

738
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:01,664
If you dare to tell others, we'll definitely kill you.

739
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:05,960
We'll publish these too!
At home, at school, and on the Internet.

740
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:07,237
Fujishima.

741
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,088
Kanako was laughing.

742
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:11,967
She said you came running to her with a wagging tail
just because she pet you.

743
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,518
Do you love her?

744
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,313
Say, how often have you been turned on by Kanako?

745
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:27,358
Tell me!

746
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:30,568
I was seduced.

747
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:33,032
It was

748
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,532
your daughter!

749
01:03:39,786 --> 01:03:40,621
Sensei,

750
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:43,958
you like young girls, right?

751
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:45,626
Eh?

752
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:49,588
I understand you.
I understand you completely.

753
01:03:55,844 --> 01:03:58,597
Of course, I didn't do anything with her.

754
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:02,101
But a few days later,

755
01:04:02,684 --> 01:04:04,894
a man called me.

756
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:06,387
Who?

757
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:09,733
A businessman named Cho.

758
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,402
Is it him?

759
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,364
Answer me!

760
01:04:16,364 --> 01:04:17,574
Yes.

761
01:04:21,494 --> 01:04:25,021
Tell me everything about Kanako!

762
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:26,625
What has she done?

763
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:28,751
What has she said?

764
01:04:31,505 --> 01:04:33,632
What the hell is she?

765
01:04:35,842 --> 01:04:38,971
She is your daughter.

766
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:53,943
Kanako called and said

767
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:55,862
you should keep your body clean

768
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:57,815
and ready for action!

769
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:02,994
Did you get it, Alice?

770
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:06,664
This is your new name!

771
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:17,967
If you fall into such a deep hole,
you keep falling and falling.

772
01:05:19,385 --> 01:05:21,054
It's a tale about such a girl.

773
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:41,784
The police called me.
Kanako's friend was killed.

774
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:44,235
They asked me questions.

775
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:46,538
But I don't know anything.

776
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:50,501
What is going on?

777
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,420
Say! Where is Kanako?

778
01:05:56,673 --> 01:05:57,925
Kanako is...

779
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:00,344
your daughter.

780
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:01,887
I understand you.

781
01:06:03,514 --> 01:06:05,306
I understand you completely.

782
01:06:06,557 --> 01:06:07,976
Just like him.

783
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:10,344
He...

784
01:06:10,688 --> 01:06:11,880
You...

785
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:12,898
I...?

786
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:14,483
...did it with me.

787
01:06:18,237 --> 01:06:22,449
You want to do it as well.
Right, Sensei?

788
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:26,619
Bullshit!

789
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:29,873
I'm not lying.

790
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:33,751
That's what she said.

791
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:36,505
Your daughter said

792
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:39,148
you

793
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:43,594
abused her.

794
01:06:43,594 --> 01:06:44,880
Stop kidding me!

795
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:48,851
Bitch! I'll kill you!

796
01:06:57,275 --> 01:06:58,492
What is it?

797
01:07:01,947 --> 01:07:02,947
I...

798
01:07:03,072 --> 01:07:05,617
What's wrong?
Something must have happened!

799
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:10,039
I...

800
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:11,623
What do you want?

801
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:14,909
Papa.

802
01:07:21,842 --> 01:07:22,592
You bitch!

803
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:25,471
Do you want me to kill you?

804
01:07:25,846 --> 01:07:31,684
She was almost killed by her beloved father.

805
01:07:31,809 --> 01:07:33,010
That's not true!

806
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,650
Why?

807
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:41,903
You love me, don't you?

808
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:44,114
She is my daughter!

809
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,867
So what?

810
01:07:52,414 --> 01:07:53,724
Because you love me?

811
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,159
I...

812
01:07:58,586 --> 01:07:59,938
Is that why you hit me?

813
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:03,099
I...

814
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:07,679
I understand you, Papa.  Completely.

815
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:12,192
I love you.

816
01:08:29,368 --> 01:08:30,527
Bitch!

817
01:08:31,494 --> 01:08:32,613
You bitch!

818
01:08:33,913 --> 01:08:36,207
Die! Die!

819
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:37,835
Is she still alive?

820
01:08:43,381 --> 01:08:44,466
Kanako...

821
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:50,096
Where is she? Tell me!

822
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,472
Where is she now?

823
01:08:51,806 --> 01:08:53,725
Shut up, bitch!

824
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,560
Shut up! Disappear!

825
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:59,480
Let me alone.
Go die!

826
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:06,572
Kanako is scary.

827
01:09:11,034 --> 01:09:14,579
She lures people by telling them what they want to hear.

828
01:09:15,706 --> 01:09:16,974
I love you.

829
01:09:19,752 --> 01:09:24,506
And then she ruins them.

830
01:09:52,076 --> 01:09:54,619
What are you laughing, you bitch!

831
01:10:13,137 --> 01:10:14,338
Fujishima.

832
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:50,421
Because of your magic spell

833
01:10:52,564 --> 01:10:53,720
I am

834
01:10:57,807 --> 01:10:59,592
no longer the person I was.

835
01:11:19,997 --> 01:11:23,500
Where is Kanako?

836
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:25,127
Where are you?

837
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:28,171
Do you really know where you are?

838
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,565
Shitty yakuza.

839
01:11:35,386 --> 01:11:36,346
Does it hurt?

840
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:40,475
This is the punishment for what your daughter has caused.

841
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,521
What has she done?

842
01:11:46,398 --> 01:11:49,193
There once was a man named Cho.

843
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:54,238
Your daughter was his darling, but

844
01:11:55,573 --> 01:11:58,409
she took the liberty of taking strictly private photos

845
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:03,373
and sold them all to dirty old geezers.

846
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,288
This is not a joke, Papa.

847
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:14,342
Your daughter allows herself too much.

848
01:12:48,418 --> 01:12:49,627
See you!

849
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:51,904
See you!

850
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,881
Good night.

851
01:13:00,346 --> 01:13:02,140
I keep falling down this deep hole.

852
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:05,226
Even so,

853
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,579
I'm not afraid.

854
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:14,028
Because I feel close to you,

855
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:17,780
Fujishima.

856
01:13:22,453 --> 01:13:25,663
You bastards are all scum.

857
01:13:26,873 --> 01:13:29,792
We are scum, but we follow the rules.

858
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:36,257
Rules that provide happiness for everyone.

859
01:13:37,676 --> 01:13:38,636
Rules?

860
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:41,012
Your daughter broke them.

861
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,891
That's why

862
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:47,394
I'll kill her.

863
01:13:47,478 --> 01:13:49,220
The culprit is Matsunaga.

864
01:13:49,604 --> 01:13:51,681
That kid plotted everything.

865
01:13:52,358 --> 01:13:54,525
Kanako was used by him.

866
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,145
It doesn't seem so.

867
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,418
I took good care of him.

868
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:16,340
But he fell in love with your daughter and betrayed me.

869
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:19,426
Idiot!

870
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:25,849
That's Fujishima Kanako's father.

871
01:14:25,975 --> 01:14:27,643
Say hello to him.

872
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:32,989
Matsunaga ...

873
01:14:34,358 --> 01:14:35,917
You're finished.

874
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:37,152
You should better say

875
01:14:38,362 --> 01:14:39,921
this is the beginning.

876
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:54,002
Where?

877
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:56,787
Where do you want to be cut?

878
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:01,426
How about here?

879
01:15:06,597 --> 01:15:08,020
Fujishima,

880
01:15:09,597 --> 01:15:11,020
where is she?

881
01:15:11,604 --> 01:15:13,021
You are crazy.

882
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:21,113
She's at a hotel.

883
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:24,533
The hotel at the North exit, Hotel Eden.

884
01:15:30,122 --> 01:15:31,457
You did that to Ogata too, right?

885
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,712
Ogata, who died, experienced the same as me.

886
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:48,765
We killed Ogata.

887
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,065
Because he was so small and cute,

888
01:16:00,277 --> 01:16:04,948
we brought him to old men countless times.

889
01:16:08,618 --> 01:16:10,371
That's why he committed suicide.

890
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:19,462
Kanako became close to us to avenge his death.

891
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:27,554
I knew it all the time.

892
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:35,645
Fujishima loved Ogata, right?

893
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:41,527
You can't really understand Kanako's feelings.

894
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:46,073
Kanako...

895
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:47,690
I love you.

896
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:50,618
She is so gentle

897
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:55,207
but somehow soulless.

898
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,543
And then she ruins them.

899
01:17:01,713 --> 01:17:05,926
If I can be with her,

900
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:08,970
I would do anything.

901
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,596
Even if you would get killed?

902
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,849
I wouldn't care.

903
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:18,980
She is so crazy and so soulless.

904
01:17:22,192 --> 01:17:24,903
She ruins everyone's life.

905
01:17:25,863 --> 01:17:27,238
So why...

906
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:32,869
Why does everyone become obsessed with her?

907
01:17:36,914 --> 01:17:38,207
Kanako is...

908
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,086
She is ...

909
01:17:46,257 --> 01:17:47,458
a demon.

910
01:17:48,594 --> 01:17:49,720
Papa.

911
01:17:56,894 --> 01:18:02,608
Guess how many times I've done it with her.

912
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:09,614
Don't get carried away by him, Papa!

913
01:18:09,864 --> 01:18:12,283
This kid just wants to die already.

914
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:17,957
He wants to get killed and have his peace.

915
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:41,689
You're going to go see Kanako?

916
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:43,739
Yeah.

917
01:18:44,942 --> 01:18:46,609
Do you love her?

918
01:18:49,613 --> 01:18:50,823
Yeah.

919
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,372
You will get killed.

920
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:02,208
Then,

921
01:19:03,377 --> 01:19:05,128
I should leave a mark.

922
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:28,152
This is the proof that I've lived.

923
01:19:36,493 --> 01:19:39,787
Please. I'll give you the photos and anything.

924
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:43,125
So let Kanako...

925
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:50,256
I will do anything.

926
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:54,677
You love your daughter so much, even if she's a lunatic?

927
01:19:54,677 --> 01:19:57,305
What a joke! That little bitch!

928
01:19:57,389 --> 01:19:58,890
Then, why?

929
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:04,646
I have no clue.

930
01:20:07,524 --> 01:20:14,739
I must, one more time, with those hands of mine...

931
01:20:14,864 --> 01:20:15,990
Embrace her?

932
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,451
Beat her!

933
01:20:19,036 --> 01:20:22,038
That bitch, how dare she look down on me!

934
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:24,457
I'm going to beat her

935
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,627
with these hands of mine!

936
01:20:28,753 --> 01:20:30,338
That little bitch,

937
01:20:32,591 --> 01:20:36,177
I'll beat her up!

938
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,381
I love you.

939
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:48,524
This is Cho's dog.

940
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:50,192
Can you kill him?

941
01:20:50,775 --> 01:20:53,945
He's a police officer but became one of Cho's men.

942
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:01,494
A cop?

943
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:03,622
Yeah, and a tricky one.

944
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,252
He kills everyone who threatens Cho.

945
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:10,962
He has killed too often.

946
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:14,300
In the convenience store, the Internet cafe,

947
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:16,885
perhaps even your daughter.

948
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,471
He's crazy.

949
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,056
A psycho!

950
01:21:23,475 --> 01:21:26,311
But Cho gives that crazy dog so much money

951
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:29,981
that his wife and kid live a comfortable life.

952
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,653
She's a great woman, eh?

953
01:21:34,737 --> 01:21:36,322
He has everything

954
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:40,658
that you have lost.

955
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:44,872
Do you envy him,

956
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:47,140
Papa?

957
01:21:53,838 --> 01:21:55,173
Such a thing...

958
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:01,671
Do you dream?

959
01:22:03,724 --> 01:22:05,384
You have no dreams?

960
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:11,832
Dreams?

961
01:22:14,859 --> 01:22:16,060
I have.

962
01:22:20,157 --> 01:22:22,451
Of course I have dreams.

963
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:24,802
What kind of dreams?

964
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:32,877
I have a beautiful wife and daughter.

965
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:38,926
Both of them

966
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:40,970
love me.

967
01:22:44,305 --> 01:22:46,475
This happiness,

968
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:50,496
with my own hands

969
01:22:56,694 --> 01:22:58,170
I destroy it.

970
01:23:00,197 --> 01:23:01,523
That kind of dream.

971
01:23:04,952 --> 01:23:06,703
Let go of me!

972
01:23:49,521 --> 01:23:50,560
Bitch!

973
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,324
Bitch!

974
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:57,171
Die.

975
01:23:58,296 --> 01:23:59,672
Die!

976
01:24:07,305 --> 01:24:08,515
Bitch!

977
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,975
Lord, please forgive us our sins

978
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,228
as we forgive others.

979
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:17,065
Deliver us from temptation

980
01:24:17,565 --> 01:24:22,613
and give us salvation...

981
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:25,207
(Papa)

982
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:38,796
It's destroyed, your precious thing!

983
01:24:40,296 --> 01:24:42,341
You bastard are scum!

984
01:24:46,052 --> 01:24:49,014
Where is Kanako?
Did you kill her?

985
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:52,643
I haven't killed her yet.

986
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:59,692
And you won't.
If you kill her, I'll kill your family as well.

987
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:01,568
Don't touch them.

988
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:05,572
Okay, I'll give your daughter back.
It's an exchange.

989
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:07,615
How dare you command me!

990
01:25:07,992 --> 01:25:10,868
You shitty killer!

991
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:16,708
Killer?

992
01:25:37,395 --> 01:25:39,230
Taking a trip with your family?

993
01:25:39,355 --> 01:25:40,748
How nice.

994
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:43,193
Where are you going?

995
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:48,198
Don't play dumb.
You policemen are connected with the yakuza, aren't you?

996
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:50,158
What?
That again!

997
01:25:50,242 --> 01:25:53,703
What rules! You piece of shit!

998
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:07,485
That guy...

999
01:27:11,323 --> 01:27:14,243
He told you about me, right?

1000
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:26,963
Can you forgive it?
Can you forgive me?

1001
01:27:45,649 --> 01:27:46,733
I...

1002
01:28:55,051 --> 01:28:58,055
Be grateful, old man!

1003
01:29:00,765 --> 01:29:02,059
You are crazy.

1004
01:29:02,184 --> 01:29:04,895
You even killed your own master.

1005
01:29:05,688 --> 01:29:09,190
He commanded me to stop killing.

1006
01:29:09,274 --> 01:29:11,609
He wouldn't shut up so I silenced him!

1007
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:15,698
Papa!

1008
01:29:30,045 --> 01:29:32,206
I'll kill as I please from now on.

1009
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:35,259
I'll make my own rules.

1010
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:37,802
Where's Kanako?

1011
01:29:38,136 --> 01:29:39,994
You'll meet her in hell.

1012
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:50,064
Bastard!

1013
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:14,648
Papa!

1014
01:30:15,966 --> 01:30:18,510
Why don't you shoot that kid as well?

1015
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:21,930
I bet you can't wait to kill him!

1016
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:25,266
Whether it's me or your son,

1017
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,186
as long as you can kill anyone, you don't care!

1018
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,771
You pervert!

1019
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:32,231
Shut up!

1020
01:30:32,858 --> 01:30:34,434
The garbage is you, Bastard!

1021
01:30:50,376 --> 01:30:51,710
I'm going to kill you.

1022
01:30:52,877 --> 01:30:55,546
You and your daughter.

1023
01:30:56,006 --> 01:30:58,759
Is Kanako still alive?

1024
01:30:58,841 --> 01:31:00,051
I'm going to kill her!

1025
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:13,595
She is

1026
01:31:16,796 --> 01:31:18,194
still alive.

1027
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:19,256
Papa!

1028
01:32:27,305 --> 01:32:28,724
Drop the gun!

1029
01:32:43,113 --> 01:32:44,823
Arrest him!

1030
01:33:08,221 --> 01:33:09,715
It was suicide.

1031
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,670
That old man!

1032
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:16,372
She's alive,

1033
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,042
that girl.

1034
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:21,920
Perhaps the hole was too deep.

1035
01:34:23,212 --> 01:34:27,216
Alice kept falling slowly.

1036
01:34:27,342 --> 01:34:28,844
(Alice in Wonderland)

1037
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,262
She looked around while she sank down.

1038
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:37,770
Lots of time for her to think what would happen next.

1039
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:42,899
Suddenly she hit the ground.

1040
01:34:43,024 --> 01:34:46,110
The fall had finally ended.

1041
01:34:46,945 --> 01:34:49,198
Only with a small scratch, Alice stood up.

1042
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:55,203
She looked up at the dark ceiling

1043
01:34:55,328 --> 01:35:00,376
and saw a rabbit running, late for his time.

1044
01:35:04,087 --> 01:35:07,632
She wondered how she could get out of here.

1045
01:35:07,757 --> 01:35:10,426
Each of the castle doors were locked.

1046
01:35:14,555 --> 01:35:16,600
(Eden Hotel, Room 818)

1047
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:44,752
Alice was irritated.

1048
01:35:44,877 --> 01:35:47,006
How in the world

1049
01:35:47,088 --> 01:35:50,967
should she escape from this place?

1050
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:52,644
I've been waiting.

1051
01:36:16,243 --> 01:36:18,153
I knew you would come.

1052
01:36:25,168 --> 01:36:28,171
Did you trick me?

1053
01:36:29,422 --> 01:36:30,681
Are you crying?

1054
01:36:30,506 --> 01:36:31,507
Shut up!

1055
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:32,342
It's pretty obvious.

1056
01:36:32,342 --> 01:36:33,592
Answer me!

1057
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:40,475
Why did you do this to me?

1058
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,854
Because you

1059
01:36:44,854 --> 01:36:46,681
were always watching me.

1060
01:36:47,649 --> 01:36:48,809
Fujishima.

1061
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:50,610
It made me happy.

1062
01:36:51,235 --> 01:36:52,488
Very happy.

1063
01:36:53,197 --> 01:36:55,658
Fujishima Kanako.

1064
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:57,618
But I'm sorry.

1065
01:36:57,909 --> 01:36:59,953
That's not me.

1066
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:07,670
That's not me, it's another girl.

1067
01:37:07,752 --> 01:37:08,462
But...

1068
01:37:08,587 --> 01:37:10,546
I've been in here all the time.

1069
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:12,875
In here...

1070
01:37:14,009 --> 01:37:15,252
Alone...

1071
01:37:16,552 --> 01:37:18,337
I've been dreaming the whole time.

1072
01:37:27,855 --> 01:37:29,565
What kind of joke is this?

1073
01:37:32,235 --> 01:37:33,444
I don't understand what you mean!

1074
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:34,697
What dream?

1075
01:37:34,697 --> 01:37:38,158
Was it to come close to me, deceive me,

1076
01:37:38,283 --> 01:37:39,827
throw me into this chaos?

1077
01:37:39,952 --> 01:37:41,869
That's right, chaos.

1078
01:37:42,453 --> 01:37:45,207
There are no rules because it's a dream.

1079
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,128
Anything goes.

1080
01:37:50,671 --> 01:37:52,840
You can love anyone

1081
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,989
and you can do anything to the one you love.

1082
01:37:55,216 --> 01:37:56,568
Kiss them.

1083
01:37:58,136 --> 01:37:59,529
Kill them.

1084
01:38:10,064 --> 01:38:11,442
What do you want to do,

1085
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:15,320
Papa?

1086
01:38:17,072 --> 01:38:21,534
Occasionally, some disoriented people appear in my dreams

1087
01:38:22,328 --> 01:38:24,246
But they run away at once.

1088
01:38:31,045 --> 01:38:33,881
Because freedom is scary.

1089
01:38:35,006 --> 01:38:36,216
Fujishima.

1090
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:42,347
Look at this.
Isn't it hilarious!

1091
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:49,229
Fujishima Kanako.

1092
01:38:53,108 --> 01:38:59,614
The one and only beautiful creature on Earth.

1093
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:01,774
I'm going to kill you.

1094
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:05,287
What are you laughing about?

1095
01:39:17,216 --> 01:39:18,567
Is it me?

1096
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,345
Am I that funny?

1097
01:39:23,305 --> 01:39:25,890
Then, I'll beat you up now!

1098
01:39:31,646 --> 01:39:33,356
I will beat you up

1099
01:39:36,318 --> 01:39:38,069
and then laugh myself!

1100
01:39:41,532 --> 01:39:42,699
You bitch.

1101
01:39:48,747 --> 01:39:50,039
I love you.

1102
01:40:02,845 --> 01:40:04,212
Are you scared?

1103
01:40:10,685 --> 01:40:11,987
I'm scared.

1104
01:40:12,563 --> 01:40:13,771
Very much.

1105
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:15,733
It's okay

1106
01:40:22,405 --> 01:40:24,488
Did you love him?

1107
01:40:26,405 --> 01:40:29,287
Did you love Ogata?

1108
01:40:29,912 --> 01:40:32,416
Yes, very much.

1109
01:40:38,212 --> 01:40:39,997
That's why I killed him.

1110
01:40:43,469 --> 01:40:47,139
I wanted to love him more and more.

1111
01:40:48,515 --> 01:40:49,975
Fujishima...

1112
01:40:53,604 --> 01:40:56,398
Fujishima Kanako...

1113
01:40:57,774 --> 01:40:58,998
I love you.

1114
01:41:07,076 --> 01:41:08,260
Who...

1115
01:41:11,704 --> 01:41:12,930
are you?

1116
01:42:06,217 --> 01:42:10,170
(Akiko, I'm picking up the cake.)
(I'll be back soon so wait for me! -Mom)

1117
01:42:43,546 --> 01:42:46,257
Sensei, do you remember me?

1118
01:42:46,926 --> 01:42:49,011
I am Fujishima Kanako's father.

1119
01:42:49,552 --> 01:42:50,921
What do you want?

1120
01:42:52,555 --> 01:42:55,434
I've been searching for my daughter since then.

1121
01:42:58,103 --> 01:42:59,921
I've found out a little about her.

1122
01:43:01,264 --> 01:43:03,033
Why do you do this?

1123
01:43:05,569 --> 01:43:08,572
My daughter was scum.

1124
01:43:09,739 --> 01:43:11,917
It proves that she's definitely my daughter.

1125
01:43:13,284 --> 01:43:16,162
She got involved with gangs and drugs.

1126
01:43:16,162 --> 01:43:21,627
When she entered high school, she began selling drugs

1127
01:43:22,353 --> 01:43:24,087
and forced students to sell their bodies.

1128
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:27,131
I didn't know anything of this.

1129
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:34,681
You did know it.

1130
01:43:45,234 --> 01:43:46,318
Fujishima-san!

1131
01:43:47,987 --> 01:43:49,154
Sensei!

1132
01:43:49,279 --> 01:43:52,824
The customers were rich, perverted businessmen.

1133
01:43:54,534 --> 01:43:58,538
Kanako even used schoolmates who were a lot younger than herself.

1134
01:43:58,997 --> 01:44:00,582
Is Aki-chan doing well?

1135
01:44:01,332 --> 01:44:04,586
Yes.
To be true, I just wanted to talk about her.

1136
01:44:04,712 --> 01:44:05,753
Yes?

1137
01:44:06,087 --> 01:44:09,591
She suddenly had her own cellphone.

1138
01:44:10,592 --> 01:44:13,929
I asked her and she told me you gave it to her.

1139
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:16,140
Is that true?

1140
01:44:16,431 --> 01:44:18,516
Sorry that I did not inform you.

1141
01:44:19,143 --> 01:44:20,144
It's true.

1142
01:44:21,103 --> 01:44:23,855
She helped me a little so I gave her a reward.

1143
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:31,279
Look closely at it.

1144
01:44:32,113 --> 01:44:35,408
I've looked at this crap a hundred times

1145
01:44:37,036 --> 01:44:38,712
and finally I understood.

1146
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,353
What is this?

1147
01:44:46,252 --> 01:44:50,256
The girl on this photo is your daughter.

1148
01:44:57,096 --> 01:44:59,975
I'm not forcing her into prostitution.

1149
01:45:00,516 --> 01:45:02,552
I just suggested to try it and Aki-chan...

1150
01:45:02,685 --> 01:45:03,561
What are you saying!

1151
01:45:06,356 --> 01:45:07,565
I don't understand.

1152
01:45:09,234 --> 01:45:13,488
Why did you do this to her?

1153
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:16,158
Because she's so cute, of course.

1154
01:45:19,036 --> 01:45:22,372
I will never forgive this.

1155
01:45:23,247 --> 01:45:24,707
Whom?

1156
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:27,293
Kanako?

1157
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:30,296
Or your daughter?

1158
01:45:30,421 --> 01:45:34,760
Don't joke with me!
It was your daughter who incited her!

1159
01:45:36,052 --> 01:45:39,597
This is what Aki-chan decided on her own free will.

1160
01:45:41,015 --> 01:45:42,893
She doesn't know any better.

1161
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:50,317
She doesn't understand...what you incited her to do.

1162
01:45:50,317 --> 01:45:51,359
I wonder about that.

1163
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:53,069
How old do you think she is!

1164
01:45:55,363 --> 01:45:56,782
Akiko is still...

1165
01:45:57,073 --> 01:46:00,452
But that's what's popular among older men!

1166
01:46:11,212 --> 01:46:15,301
She's a demon, that girl.

1167
01:46:15,384 --> 01:46:16,885
A demon?

1168
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:24,225
So what did you do to that demon?

1169
01:46:30,649 --> 01:46:31,817
Tell me.

1170
01:46:33,277 --> 01:46:34,936
What did you do to her?

1171
01:46:41,868 --> 01:46:43,621
Give her back.

1172
01:46:44,997 --> 01:46:46,206
Give her back?

1173
01:46:46,289 --> 01:46:50,918
Give me back the purity of that girl!

1174
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:53,296
Her purity?

1175
01:46:53,505 --> 01:46:55,381
But look, Sensei, Aki-chan...

1176
01:46:55,466 --> 01:46:57,009
Don't say a word!

1177
01:46:58,886 --> 01:47:02,096
What do you know about her?

1178
01:47:04,725 --> 01:47:06,609
Then, do you understand her?

1179
01:47:07,185 --> 01:47:11,148
Do you look closely at her?

1180
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:14,944
Watch her, touch her...

1181
01:47:16,779 --> 01:47:23,243
Do you know the sensible spots on her body?
Where she wants to be touched?

1182
01:47:23,409 --> 01:47:24,953
What are you saying?

1183
01:47:26,997 --> 01:47:30,751
Aki-chan told me,
"Mama doesn't understand me at all."

1184
01:47:32,586 --> 01:47:39,260
"She knows nothing... about my feelings."

1185
01:47:43,096 --> 01:47:44,672
She said she felt lonely.

1186
01:48:00,322 --> 01:48:02,091
Where is she?

1187
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:05,452
Where did you put my daughter?

1188
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,351
Is this how you killed her?

1189
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,663
That's right.

1190
01:48:36,274 --> 01:48:37,693
Why?

1191
01:48:38,444 --> 01:48:40,194
You don't know?

1192
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:44,783
Because I love her.

1193
01:48:45,868 --> 01:48:49,912
Akiko, my daughter.

1194
01:49:02,009 --> 01:49:03,469
I guess you can't understand

1195
01:49:04,552 --> 01:49:11,476
these kind of human emotions.

1196
01:49:12,685 --> 01:49:15,564
You...love her?

1197
01:49:15,689 --> 01:49:18,108
There's no way you would know!

1198
01:49:20,402 --> 01:49:22,090
Because here

1199
01:49:23,002 --> 01:49:24,590
and here

1200
01:49:25,114 --> 01:49:28,243
you're completely empty.

1201
01:49:38,295 --> 01:49:39,587
You love her.

1202
01:49:46,345 --> 01:49:47,762
Enough of that.

1203
01:49:48,889 --> 01:49:50,140
Sensei.

1204
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:54,770
That was very funny.

1205
01:49:57,939 --> 01:49:59,307
You bitch.

1206
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,752
Find her already.

1207
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,092
You buried her, so dig her up.

1208
01:51:10,930 --> 01:51:14,015
That's impossible.

1209
01:51:15,225 --> 01:51:16,935
I don't care how many years it'll take.

1210
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,729
As long as you don't find Kanako,

1211
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:22,733
you won't see your own daughter.

1212
01:51:32,117 --> 01:51:33,452
You are crazy.

1213
01:51:35,912 --> 01:51:40,708
You, and your daughter as well.

1214
01:51:42,502 --> 01:51:46,715
Of course.
We have the same blood.

1215
01:51:52,762 --> 01:51:54,506
Hurry up and find her!

1216
01:52:00,395 --> 01:52:01,805
Take me back.

1217
01:52:04,817 --> 01:52:06,627
Let me see my daughter.

1218
01:52:06,627 --> 01:52:07,836
No way.

1219
01:52:07,836 --> 01:52:09,279
Then kill me!

1220
01:52:12,824 --> 01:52:14,493
That would be too easy.

1221
01:52:14,993 --> 01:52:17,975
As long as you don't find Kanako,

1222
01:52:20,094 --> 01:52:22,576
this hell will continue.

1223
01:52:31,342 --> 01:52:32,591
I...

1224
01:52:34,842 --> 01:52:37,990
don't know anything about her.

1225
01:52:40,226 --> 01:52:44,273
Nothing at all.

1226
01:52:57,994 --> 01:52:59,622
I only remember

1227
01:53:03,167 --> 01:53:10,548
when I attempted to strangle her

1228
01:53:15,345 --> 01:53:17,931
what a feeling I had in these hands.

1229
01:53:52,548 --> 01:53:53,817
It's birthday.

1230
01:53:57,429 --> 01:53:59,456
Today is her birthday.

1231
01:54:03,519 --> 01:54:05,261
She's 18 now.

1232
01:54:20,828 --> 01:54:22,529
Find her quickly.

1233
01:54:56,738 --> 01:54:58,323
Where is she?

1234
01:54:58,573 --> 01:54:59,966
I don't know!

1235
01:55:01,034 --> 01:55:04,537
But she's a dead body now.

1236
01:55:09,167 --> 01:55:10,702
She is still alive.

1237
01:55:22,847 --> 01:55:24,600
As long as I live,

1238
01:55:25,559 --> 01:55:27,019
she's alive too.

1239
01:55:34,818 --> 01:55:36,489
She...

1240
01:55:37,818 --> 01:55:39,489
is me.

1241
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:50,667
I will

1242
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:56,006
with my own hands

1243
01:55:59,592 --> 01:56:00,860
personally

1244
01:56:06,891 --> 01:56:08,644
and mercilessly

1245
01:56:09,811 --> 01:56:11,329
kill her!
