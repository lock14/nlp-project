1
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,706
I'm gonna get those fuckers!

2
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:38,012
This ain't the Bronx, right?
I'm gonna get the motherfuckers!

3
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:42,021
I'm gonna corner him,
the motherfucker!

4
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:46,058
First one we see, straight up,
we whack the fucker!

5
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:47,593
Kneecap the fucker!

6
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,993
People just stood and watched.

7
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,699
- He stared at me.
- They're fuckin' losers.

8
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:54,969
The twins were there.

9
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:57,970
I swear on the Koran
I'll kill 'em both.

10
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,568
Who are these motherfuckers?

11
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:04,109
They hang out round here.

12
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,772
They're from Le Moulin.
We'll waste the shits.

13
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,016
We'll get the motherfuckers!

14
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,618
Right on, bro!

15
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:15,450
- They think we're losers!
- You said it.

16
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,750
We'll blindside 'em, straight up.

17
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,285
I'm goin'. You guys can come too.

18
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,158
You're in, right? Everyone's in?

19
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:24,697
Waste the fuckers!

20
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,628
Quit the big talk.

21
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:30,468
Don't say that! You're crazy!

22
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,472
Yo, clock Krimo!

23
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:34,972
- Come here!
- Fuckin' run!

24
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,478
He better not chicken out!

25
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:39,637
Right on. If he does, I swear...

26
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:40,971
What's goin' on?

27
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,242
Slam's had his gear bit.

28
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:44,646
- Who by?
- 8 fuckers!

29
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,955
The twins included. Know them?

30
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:48,248
Fucked him over.

31
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:49,651
- On the Koran?
- On me!

32
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,083
You in? Let's go!

33
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,954
Come on, let's go!

34
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:54,351
You in?

35
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,156
Come on, move it!

36
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:58,094
I'll get my nunchucks.

37
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,257
Meet us there! Go on, hurry!

38
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,217
Magali!

39
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,995
You're there?

40
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,362
Yeah, I'm here.

41
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,235
- Where are you off to?
- Just a second.

42
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,611
I'm gonna see Krimo.

43
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:05,356
What's up?

44
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,502
Don't play innocent with me.

45
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,667
What's wrong?

46
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:12,599
A week I've been lookin' for you.
You don't answer my calls.

47
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,702
Hey, I wasted all my credit.

48
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:17,272
- All gone.
- Yeah?

49
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:21,348
I couldn't call from home,
the old lady just got the bill.

50
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,142
Your mom never said I called?

51
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,349
Sure, I believe you!

52
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,521
And the guys? Makou didn't say?

53
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,924
Fathi didn't say?
Are they against me?

54
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,653
Your phone was always busy.

55
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,990
Stop lyin' to me!

56
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,959
I never used my phone.
I was waitin' for your call.

57
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,139
You think I'll fall for this?

58
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,435
I've had enough of you. Get lost.

59
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,577
Come on, let's forget it.

60
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,340
Leave me.

61
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,276
C'mon.

62
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,654
Just for a week.

63
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,280
It's over.

64
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,265
You come here,
you think I'm your slut?

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,007
Shithead!

66
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,370
Motherfucker!

67
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,060
Abdelkrim!

68
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:55,466
Hurry up, we have to get going.

69
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,475
- Where?
- To see your father.

70
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,238
I'm not coming today.

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,944
Why?

72
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:04,650
What's wrong?

73
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:07,614
Nothing, I'm goin' out.
I'll go next week.

74
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,484
What are you doing?

75
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,422
Seein' the guys.

76
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,188
Guys? Girls!

77
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,226
- No, guys.
- Sure.

78
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,201
You'll get some privacy today.

79
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:23,667
Privacy?
In a prison visiting room?

80
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,142
I've made dinner. Just warm it up.

81
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:30,978
- What is it?
- Pasta.

82
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,011
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

83
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,316
It's okay, thanks.

84
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,915
See you.

85
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,487
- What?
- No messing about.

86
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:43,422
And tell Dad

87
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,318
that I said "Hi"
and that I'll see him next week.

88
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,427
Mom!

89
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,169
You're doing your hair?

90
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,369
See you later.

91
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,986
I wanted the flounce down to here.

92
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,189
It's a real sloppy job.

93
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,664
Longer, I said. Fuck!

94
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,298
- Remember.
- I noted it.

95
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:30,938
Go on, lengthen it.

96
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:32,903
- I can't now.
- Lengthen it.

97
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,234
- I can't.
- Please.

98
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,378
- That's what we said.
- I wanted it to here.

99
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:38,636
I noted it.

100
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,710
C'mon, lengthen it.
Someone here can do it.

101
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,948
- We can't.
- You're kiddin'!

102
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,445
She can lengthen it. Ask her.

103
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,111
Can you do the flounce?

104
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,484
No, I'm too busy.

105
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:52,215
We're too busy.

106
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:54,285
C'mon, lengthen it.

107
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,454
- Work something out.
- There's no time now.

108
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,734
Krimo, come and take a look at this.

109
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,537
Be honest, how does it look?

110
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,973
- Weird.
- You don't like it?

111
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,440
It's not that,
I'm just not used to it.

112
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,046
You don't like it.

113
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,205
Is it for the play?

114
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:17,977
- It's fine for that.
- It looks good?

115
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,315
It's pretty.

116
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,216
Shouldn't the flounce be longer?

117
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,320
It's very pretty.

118
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,621
It looks good?

119
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:32,060
It's good, it's perfect.

120
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,700
We said 70.

121
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:45,203
No, brother, 50.

122
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,307
No, we said 70.

123
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,507
- We said 50.
- I want 70.

124
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:52,050
We talked and agreed on 70.

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,450
- Make it 50 now.
- I can't.

126
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,249
You can't make it 50?

127
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:57,413
50 euros...

128
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,355
- We talked it over.
- Please.

129
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:01,423
We agreed on 70.

130
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,496
70's expensive!

131
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:06,065
50 euros is fair.

132
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,034
But that's all I have.

133
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:10,171
What'll you do now?

134
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:11,505
Take it off.

135
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,607
No way, I'll give you 50.

136
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:16,739
No, I want 70.
It's just not possible.

137
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:19,179
Lend me 10 euros, Krim.

138
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,275
Don't be a cheapskate!

139
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,989
Expensive, huh?

140
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:32,415
- Look at this thing.
- It's fine.

141
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,593
- You'll take 60?
- All right.

142
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,097
Done!

143
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:48,240
It's a real beauty.
Excellent.

144
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,608
I'm real happy. Thanks.

145
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,277
- You should be!
- I am.

146
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,079
Lili! Is your sister in?

147
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,084
Fetch her!

148
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,119
Don't tell her.

149
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,393
- Get her.
- It's beautiful.

150
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,058
- See you.
- Wait. Tell me when she's here.

151
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:14,261
Zina!

152
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,706
They want you.

153
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:21,969
Lydia wants you.

154
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,235
She's coming.

155
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,974
Hi, Krimo. Okay?

156
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah, great.

157
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,677
What's happenin'?

158
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,383
What's up?

159
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:33,885
Nothin'.

160
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,316
So why're you here?

161
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,594
Oh, wow, Lydia!

162
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:50,304
Incredible!

163
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:51,530
How's it look?

164
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:52,502
Wicked!

165
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,164
- Seriously?
- It's fly.

166
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,976
- You mean it?
- On my mother's life!

167
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:58,908
Seriously? I'm so happy.

168
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,047
A real Miss France.

169
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,578
That's so sweet!

170
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,113
- Who made it?
- Slant-eyes.

171
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:06,913
Is it beautiful?

172
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,077
It's fantastic.

173
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,190
It needs more lace here.

174
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,087
I wanted a longer flounce.

175
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,125
I told him to lengthen it.

176
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:17,025
Know what the fucker said? "No".
Right?

177
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,559
That fucker wouldn't lengthen it.

178
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:23,532
Who gives a toss?
It's great like that.

179
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:26,401
Are you nuts, girl?
Leave it as is!

180
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,131
The motherfucker.

181
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:31,309
With a flounce,
it wouldn't look so good.

182
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,604
- Did it cost a lot?
- Guess.

183
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,407
30.

184
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,312
60, the motherfucker!

185
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,009
I coughed up the loot.

186
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,950
Motherfucker!

187
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,351
I'd've spat in his face!

188
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,459
You saw me. I was wicked.

189
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,255
I didn't want to cough up the loot.

190
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,657
Who gives a toss?
It's fly, he did you right.

191
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,067
The colors ain't too flash?

192
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,432
You're stupid. They make it.

193
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:00,733
The color's bad, are you nuts?

194
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:04,044
Any other color,
it'd suck big time.

195
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:08,138
It's wicked! It brings it out.

196
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:09,544
It's phat!

197
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,241
That's sweet, I'm happy.

198
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,283
Straight up, it looks great.

199
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,551
Coming to the rehearsal?

200
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,021
I've a shitload of cleanin' on.

201
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,684
- I'm watchin' the kids too.
- Come on!

202
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:23,424
I swear, I have to watch the kids.

203
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,724
- Mom's going out.
- They're big.

204
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:29,400
My sista called by earlier
to ask me to go with her.

205
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:30,970
Mom said no way.

206
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,106
Not for long...

207
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,138
You don't hear her yellin'?

208
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:37,342
She won't let me,
on the Koran she won't.

209
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,573
Usually, I'm free
but she's goin' out.

210
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,344
Some other time...

211
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:43,711
See ya.

212
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:47,979
Okay, quit bitchin'!

213
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,452
Comin' with me?

214
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,054
Right now?

215
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,126
- I can't.
- Why?

216
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,994
- I'm busy.
- Please...

217
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:04,404
It's good for us
when there's an audience, see.

218
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:08,201
I get off on the audience.
Come on, come with us.

219
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,166
Me, Rachid, Frida...

220
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:13,974
I don't ask a lot, right?
Come with me for once.

221
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,241
Please, come with me.

222
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:18,644
I dunno...

223
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,654
I've got my new costume too.
It'll be cool!

224
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:27,290
- Forget it.
- Please...

225
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,323
Okay.

226
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,492
- Not for long.
- You won't regret it.

227
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,044
Hiya!

228
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,248
We've been here an hour!

229
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,944
- There.
- Fantastic!

230
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,155
- Ace!
- Phat!

231
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,282
- Pretty?
- Really bad!

232
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,289
It works?

233
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,122
Real fly, that's for sure.
Wicked!

234
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,393
- It's phat, all right!
- Seriously?

235
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,724
Ace!

236
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:09,195
- It's good?
- Deadly!

237
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:12,400
Seriously? I'm happy.

238
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,541
- Okay, Krimo?
- Fine.

239
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,642
It looks real good on you.

240
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,379
Thanks. D'you like it, Frida?

241
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:22,549
Yeah, but that's no reason
to be late.

242
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:24,207
Is it pretty?

243
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:25,710
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

244
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,346
That's sweet.

245
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,713
You crossed the hood like that?

246
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,389
You bet.

247
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:34,017
With people around?
You're nuts!

248
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,389
What do I care?

249
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:38,123
I'm more into the character
this way.

250
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,027
You're crazy!

251
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:42,064
I'm more into the character
in my dress.

252
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:44,067
It's better for actin'.

253
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,398
I get mine tonight.

254
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,668
- Really?
- Straight up.

255
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,307
It'll be phat
with us all in costume.

256
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,673
Costumes don't mean shit.

257
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:56,211
You need to show
your character's inner feelings.

258
00:13:56,384 --> 00:13:58,079
Feel its spirit, like.

259
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,288
It's what you give off
that matters most,

260
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,219
not the threads you wear.

261
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:06,258
It's not the appearance,
it's the heart.

262
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,088
It depends, you know.

263
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,390
- Remember that interview.
- About the shoes?

264
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,467
Yeah. We saw an interview
with this actor

265
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:18,264
who got into a character
when he had his shoes on.

266
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,428
See, it depends.

267
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:24,511
Watchin' us rehearse, Krimo?

268
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,139
I'm jus' takin' a look, like.

269
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,050
You could've said.

270
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,315
Why?

271
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,321
You could've let us know.

272
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,684
He's watchin' the scene, okay.

273
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,326
It bothers me, him bein' here.

274
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,656
He'll just watch, like in class.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,490
He can watch if he wants

276
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:51,104
but you could've said!
Rachid said Hannan'd be here.

277
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,240
Does Krimo bother you?

278
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:54,966
He's just gonna watch!

279
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,405
Well, he bothers me!

280
00:14:56,577 --> 00:15:00,445
C'mon, it's Krimo,
not the friggin' President!

281
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,947
- We're here to rehearse!
- I'll go.

282
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,311
No, Krimo, you stay.

283
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,716
Let him stay,
we need to get used to an audience.

284
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,386
What's your problem?

285
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,320
Here, sit yourself down.

286
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:12,720
Quit freakin' out!

287
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,154
We fix a rehearsal,
we get here on time...

288
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,390
- He's just watchin'.
- You keep us waitin'...

289
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,659
- It's okay.
- Chill!

290
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,627
What's up? You're pissed?

291
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:26,501
You bet! You're late,
you bring someone...

292
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,005
But at school...

293
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,576
At school,
it's part of the class.

294
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:33,942
Think this is
some dating agency here?

295
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:36,106
He's watchin'. What's wrong?

296
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,911
- Screw that!
- She's freakin' out!

297
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:41,020
- You bet I am!
- You're crazy!

298
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,316
Sure I am! Fuck, she's too much.

299
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,618
Frida, please, let's get started.

300
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,923
I have a soccer game after.

301
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:51,092
- It's a rehearsal.
- So let's rehearse.

302
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,096
He can come to the show.

303
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:57,192
- Concentrate, instead of yellin'!
- Concentrate?

304
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,473
Let's not waste any more time!

305
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,179
Where were we?

306
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,675
Hurry it up.

307
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,680
Chill.

308
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,651
- Before...
- Act 2, scene 5.

309
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,059
Take it from here.

310
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,561
"I should be surprised... "
Okay?

311
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,555
Frida, you're not on.

312
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,463
Let's go.

313
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:35,500
Let's go.

314
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,242
- She's pissin' me off.
- Go on!

315
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:44,275
Bismillah...

316
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:49,984
I should be surprised in turn
by your prompt homage.

317
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:52,455
Once acquainted, it will fade away.

318
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,226
In that case, madame,
any loss will be to my disadvantage.

319
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,161
You overestimate me.

320
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,064
As you do me.
I should be on my knees to speak!

321
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,625
We do not control our fate.

322
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,633
Our parents pay us no heed!

323
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:12,502
My heart would have chosen you,
whatever your credit.

324
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,370
An easy choice for it.

325
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,235
May I hope that you feel likewise?

326
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,817
Were you but Perette or Margot

327
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,178
when I spied you, whip in hand

328
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,153
on the cellar steps,
you'd be my princess yet.

329
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,849
Can such feelings endure?

330
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:31,228
To strengthen them mutually,
let us swear undying love

331
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:35,459
despite all the spelling mistakes
committed upon my person...

332
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,103
I lost it.

333
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,535
Never mind, keep going.

334
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:46,175
To strengthen them mutually,
let us swear undying love

335
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:50,447
despite all the spelling mistakes
committed upon my person.

336
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,485
I prize such a sweet vow

337
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,755
and make it most willingly.

338
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,587
I stoop
before your dazzling kindness.

339
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:00,620
Stop. I cannot bear
to see you humbled.

340
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:04,399
It's most absurd. Stand up.

341
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,300
Someone is coming.

342
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:10,437
Someone is coming.

343
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,675
Frida, where are you?

344
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,409
Step back a bit.

345
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:15,606
What, Lisette?

346
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:16,808
A word, madame.

347
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:20,279
Enough, dear girl.
Come back in fifteen minutes!

348
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,453
Maids in my land
wait to be called.

349
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,217
I must speak to Madame.

350
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,623
No, Frida, you're overdoin' it.

351
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,525
It's too flash, it sucks.

352
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,322
You come on and say your line

353
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,403
but you're overdoin' it.

354
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,871
Bustin' my balls already?

355
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,073
You're a maid in this!

356
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:42,406
When you come on,
you're hoggin' the spotlight!

357
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,275
Hey, look at yourself first,
with your fan and all!

358
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,749
I can do that, I'm the lady.

359
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,821
Only you can criticize now?

360
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:53,124
That's the way ladies are!

361
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,518
- You play the maid.
- And she's a fake lady!

362
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:57,825
And you're a fake maid.

363
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,830
At first, she's a maid,
so she can't be a real lady.

364
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:06,769
C'mon, she comes out with stuff
like "I must..." It sucks.

365
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,810
Hannan, be honest,
isn't she overdoin' it?

366
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,239
She won't listen to me.

367
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:13,245
You see!

368
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,111
You overdo it as the maid!

369
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,252
- You're overdoin' it!
- Yeah.

370
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,253
- I can't with him starin'.
- Who's starin'?

371
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,357
- Krimo!
- He's watchin' us all.

372
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,690
He's not starin' at you,
he's watchin' us all.

373
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,334
I'm not stupid, he's makin' fun.

374
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,299
He's not, he's watchin'.
Why'd he make fun?

375
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,665
Call that watchin'?

376
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,771
Holy shit, she's paranoid!

377
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,440
I saw him laughin'
while I was waitin'. Sorry,

378
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,341
there's watchin' and watchin'.
I'm not dumb!

379
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,745
He's not laughin' or starin', okay!

380
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,284
No, Krimo stay!
He's not makin' fun.

381
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,550
- I have stuff to do.
- Stay!

382
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:50,386
There!

383
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:52,357
- Happy now?
- He's sulkin'.

384
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,690
- Screw you!
- Go after him, then!

385
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,162
Look at crybaby!

386
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,600
You treated him bad, I swear.

387
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:02,797
She turns up late but that's okay!
It's all my fault!

388
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,197
Quit yellin'.

389
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:07,172
I mouth off
when Frida's the problem.

390
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,539
With Lydia, I keep it shut
but when it's Frida...

391
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:13,209
- Show some respect.
- Respect?

392
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,447
She keeps us waitin' here on her

393
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,183
and never even apologizes!

394
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,157
- It's not right.
- Get off my case!

395
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,194
Lydia!

396
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,294
Move your fuckin' ass!

397
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,661
Lydia's really heated at you now.

398
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,497
I'm heated too.
She pissed me off big time.

399
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,435
Move, Lydia!

400
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:40,176
Show more fuckin' respect to people.
Quit dissin' them.

401
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:44,211
Hey, I have my soccer game.
Hurry it up!

402
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:46,391
My game!

403
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,254
She's the disser,
bringin' someone along,

404
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,225
arrivin' late...
That's respect?

405
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:53,557
Only natural I start bitchin'!

406
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:54,754
She's not with him.

407
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:58,164
I never said that,
I said she's pissin' me off!

408
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:01,169
- Frida!
- Chill, okay.

409
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,971
No, Frida, I mean...

410
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,405
- What's up?
- Who d'you think you are?

411
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,946
- Your act drove him off!
- Don't yell at me!

412
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:13,278
- I never made him leave, okay!
- Is this cool or not cool?

413
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:16,892
- It's not cool!
- He decided to go.

414
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,819
- What's your problem?
- Act 2, scene 5, let's go!

415
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,429
Count me out!

416
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,690
You're crazy yellin' at me,
the trouble's you!

417
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,835
Me? You're yellin' at us all,

418
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,637
pissin' us all off!

419
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:31,868
Sure I am! He bounced,
I never made him go!

420
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,237
He should take it like a dog?

421
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:35,671
Frida, please...

422
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:39,352
You're crazy, girl!
Don't even talk to me!

423
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,543
We're here to rehearse, okay!

424
00:21:42,188 --> 00:21:44,622
I'm gonna rehearse
with this mad cow?

425
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,521
- You bet you are!
- No way, not with you!

426
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:49,194
Just a second...

427
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:53,166
- Get up now and get to work!
- Don't order me!

428
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,405
- Who d'you think you are?
- No way!

429
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,734
- For my sake...
- Jus' start actin'!

430
00:21:58,909 --> 00:21:59,898
Chill, okay!

431
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,711
C'mon, move. She's crazy!

432
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,312
She's a diva!

433
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:04,606
C'mon, Lydia...

434
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,943
You know what?
Just a second...

435
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,380
Next time she pisses us off,
I'm outta here, get it?

436
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:13,651
Watch it, bitch!

437
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,257
Chill, Frida.

438
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,359
- Frida, please...
- C'mon!

439
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:19,864
Not another word. Quiet.

440
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:23,197
Take it from the top:
"I should be surprised..."

441
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,929
From the top to the end.

442
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:26,501
- I know.
- You do?

443
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,637
Let's go.

444
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,744
Take your time.

445
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:35,341
You bet I will!

446
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:38,451
I should be surprised
by your prompt homage.

447
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,747
Once acquainted, it will fade away.

448
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,214
Abdelkrim...

449
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,354
You're late.

450
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,549
Hey, it's not that late!

451
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:15,695
Where were you?

452
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,626
With the guys.

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,627
Make room for me.

454
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,571
You haven't eaten?

455
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:29,233
I have.

456
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,209
I ate at Nabil's.

457
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,551
Was Dad okay?

458
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:36,948
He didn't freak?

459
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:39,549
He did.

460
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,492
He wasn't pleased.

461
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,523
He wasn't?

462
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:53,262
There's a drawing in my bag.

463
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:18,400
Off you go, get to bed.
I have to work tomorrow.

464
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:21,304
You should go to bed too.

465
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,844
I'm not moving, I'm beat.

466
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,444
Sleeping there?

467
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,908
Good night.

468
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,748
We'll get that sailboat!

469
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,879
Yeah, we'll get that sailboat.

470
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:54,605
Note this in your books
for tomorrow.

471
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:58,410
Reply in writing
to the following question:

472
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,607
To what extent

473
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,544
- do you think...
- Not so fast.

474
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:05,189
To what extent

475
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:07,525
do you think that Marivaux

476
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:09,926
attempted

477
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,698
in Act 1, scene 5...

478
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:17,567
in Act 1, scene 5
- the one we just saw -

479
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:20,908
to favor the study of emotions...

480
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,741
at the expense of action?

481
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:30,516
I want examples!

482
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,447
Let's move on to Act 2.
We'll go straight to scene 5.

483
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:40,431
I'll need Lisette,
Arlequin and Silvia.

484
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,469
Get to your marks.

485
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,541
We're in the middle of the scene.
You follow?

486
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:52,409
Remember the situation?

487
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:56,207
Lisette has told us
at the start of Act 2, scene 1

488
00:25:56,382 --> 00:26:00,478
that Arlequin fancies her.
Do you say "fancy" these days?

489
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,892
"May I hope..."
Take it from there.

490
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:13,226
May I hope that you feel likewise?

491
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:16,338
Were you but Perette or Margot

492
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:19,703
when I spied you,
whip in hand on the cellar stairs,

493
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,601
you'd be my princess yet.

494
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,537
Can such feelings endure?

495
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:25,915
To strengthen them mutually,

496
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,486
let us swear undying love despite...

497
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,487
all the spelling mistakes
committed upon my person.

498
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,627
I prize such a sweet vow

499
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:36,054
and make it most willingly.

500
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,595
I stoop

501
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,957
before your dazzling kindness.

502
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:44,071
Stop. I cannot bear
to see you humbled.

503
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,206
It's most absurd.

504
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:47,974
Stand up.

505
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:50,203
Someone is coming.

506
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:53,217
What, Lisette?

507
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:54,443
A word, madame.

508
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,486
Enough, dear girl.
Come back in fifteen minutes!

509
00:26:58,256 --> 00:27:00,486
Maids in my land
wait to be called.

510
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:01,352
Monsieur...

511
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,493
Excuse me, I wanted to ask...
I'm the poor girl in this?

512
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:08,488
- I'm a maid acting rich?
- Exactly.

513
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:11,260
Right?
So, she's rich, acting poor?

514
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:14,263
But she comes in,
acting like she's rich.

515
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:18,243
I've just started!
Finish the scene, then we'll see.

516
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,507
Who says
I won't act poor later?

517
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,941
That's a good question.
Do you see why?

518
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:29,356
That question of hers
leads us to the heart of the play.

519
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,961
Marivaux has the rich acting poor
and the poor acting rich

520
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:36,495
and no one can really manage it.

521
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:40,361
It shows that we're prisoners
of our social condition.

522
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,270
If you're rich 20 years
and poor 20 years,

523
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,934
you can dress in rags
when you're rich

524
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:49,206
and in fancy dresses
when you're poor

525
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:53,216
but your language and conversation
stay the same.

526
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:55,251
The way you express yourself

527
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:57,412
shows where you come from.

528
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,058
This is
"The Game of Love and Chance"

529
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:04,128
but it shows there's no chance.
Who do the rich fall for?

530
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:04,991
The rich.

531
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,257
And who do the poor fall for?

532
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,961
The poor.

533
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:12,302
They recognize each other
despite their disguises.

534
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:16,075
They fall in love
within their own social class.

535
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,975
No chance and no love.

536
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:21,276
Love in the usual sense,
pure love, that is.

537
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,615
Usually, you fall in love
with the inner being,

538
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:29,220
not with what's around it.
Marivaux says that...

539
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:32,122
we're conditioned
by our original milieu.

540
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:36,531
We stick together. Even disguised,
we cannot escape our origins.

541
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:39,665
So when you play
rich people or poor people

542
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,473
playing those same roles,

543
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:44,008
they can manage it at times

544
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:47,341
but the origins are there
and they often fail.

545
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,382
- Reflexes return.
- We can imitate that.

546
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:53,943
Yes, but imitating
is only ever imitating.

547
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:56,051
Do you understand that?

548
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:59,122
These two recognize each other.

549
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,233
Their love, the purest feeling,
is influenced by their origins.

550
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:28,386
Lydia!

551
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,031
Come on!

552
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,883
- What's up?
- Okay?

553
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,995
Lydia, you owe me 10 euros.

554
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,490
You cheapskate!
That's why you called me over?

555
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,129
I've no money on me.

556
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:05,361
That's okay.

557
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:06,929
I'll pay you back.

558
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,300
There's no rush.

559
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,974
Okay, that's cool.

560
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:14,909
Cold, huh?

561
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:17,986
This fuckin' cold
makes you wanna stay in!

562
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,916
Want to see a movie?

563
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:22,353
I've got two tickets.

564
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,289
I was goin' with a homey
but he's sick.

565
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:28,591
I've got two tickets.
Want to come?

566
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:33,026
I can't. Are you crazy?
I have to rehearse with the others.

567
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:35,493
We're rehearsin'.

568
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,931
Forget it for today.

569
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:40,137
Are you crazy?
We're performin' soon

570
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:43,839
and you say forget it!
We need to rehearse every day.

571
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,349
We're on permanent rehearsal now.

572
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:48,418
It's no joke, you know.

573
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,112
Never mind, then.

574
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:52,053
- Some other time.
- Inch'Allah.

575
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,126
Okay, see you.

576
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,130
Hey, Krimo!
Don't worry, I'll pay you back.

577
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:01,062
There's no rush.
When you're ready...

578
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,933
- Straight up, okay?
- Fine.

579
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,251
Hey, Krimo, what's up?

580
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:25,454
Do me a favor.

581
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,592
Go on...

582
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:28,867
Don't tell.

583
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:30,333
I promise. Go on.

584
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,828
Swear.

585
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:34,801
I won't tell, okay. What is it?

586
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,907
On your mom's life?

587
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,875
On my mom's life, I won't.

588
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:40,973
Well?

589
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,609
- It's nothing.
- It's okay, then?

590
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:48,955
Rachid...

591
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:52,493
- On the Koran of Mecca...
- I won't tell.

592
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:55,527
Cut it out, okay,
just say what it is!

593
00:31:55,868 --> 00:31:57,358
- Straight up?
- Come on...

594
00:31:58,604 --> 00:31:59,935
Out with it!

595
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:05,141
I'd like you to let me
play Arlequin instead of you.

596
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,603
Your part as Arlequin...

597
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:11,007
Let me do it instead of you.

598
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:12,616
You wanna be Arlequin?

599
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,285
I'm in deep shit now.

600
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,152
The teacher'll freak.

601
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:31,095
Is this halal?

602
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:55,428
Let's go.

603
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:06,345
- What'll you do later?
- Be an actor.

604
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:08,952
I said actor... Well, an actress.

605
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,849
Actor and actress is different.

606
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,219
Actors are the ones
who perform on stage.

607
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,418
That's right,
and actresses are women

608
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,861
who do fights and stuff like that.

609
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,557
Actresses do fights?

610
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,963
No, you don't feel me,
you don't get

611
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,604
the meanin' of my words.

612
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,272
- Actresses do movies.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

613
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,540
- They do TV and that.
- And fights.

614
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,477
What about you?

615
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:39,620
I really want to sing.
If that doesn't work,

616
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:42,082
I'd like to be in the movies.

617
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,088
And if that doesn't work,
I'll keep studying.

618
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:46,157
Inch'Allah.

619
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:47,521
Yeah, God willing.

620
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:50,490
She wants stuff
that brings in the paper!

621
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:52,633
Shut it! I'm not that cheap!

622
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,333
God willing, I'll get a good job.

623
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:57,164
If it doesn't work out,

624
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:59,503
I'll try other stuff
but I'll work.

625
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:01,270
You'll need to strip.

626
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:03,940
Get outta here!
Not on your life!

627
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:07,118
- You have no choice.
- You bet you do!

628
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,149
And half-nude?

629
00:34:08,354 --> 00:34:10,322
Get outta here!
Not on your life!

630
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,047
What's half-nude mean?

631
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,488
Half-nude means nude to me.

632
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,925
If there's "nude" in it,
you're totally nude!

633
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,222
On the Koran!

634
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:23,269
Even in that see-thru shit,
you're still nude for me!

635
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:24,962
I don't wear it.

636
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:27,039
Suspenders, prostie shit...

637
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:29,268
Look at her, already into it!

638
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:32,206
I'll send my mom to slap you.

639
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:35,010
She's gonna get her mom!

640
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:38,620
If they want me to strip,
they'll need to ask my dad.

641
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:42,982
Hold on, what'll your old man say?
"Huh?"

642
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:45,260
He'll whack 'em! Take that!

643
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:49,358
My dad won't even say "Huh" first.

644
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,127
My dad'll bop 'em one!

645
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,538
Am I botherin' you?

646
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,313
I need to talk to you.

647
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:03,242
So talk.

648
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:04,848
Come on.

649
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,576
We can talk here.

650
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,978
No, over there.

651
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,329
What's up with you?

652
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:14,987
You after Krimo?

653
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,564
Why d'you ask?

654
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,936
Tell me, are you hot for Krimo?

655
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:20,362
Answer me.

656
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:22,028
Storm brewin'...

657
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,073
- You won't answer?
- No, I'm not hot for him.

658
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:26,607
You're not?

659
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:29,603
Krimo's actin' now!
Why is that, huh?

660
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,881
- So what?
- He has the right.

661
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,142
Sure, he can if he wants.

662
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:35,979
No, he can't if he wants.

663
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:38,455
He's doin' actin',
what's the problem?

664
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,594
- So what?
- What d'you mean?

665
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:42,293
He's actin'. So what?

666
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:45,557
- He never read a book before!
- So?

667
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,458
He ain't killed anyone!

668
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:51,002
There's some other reason.
I know him, okay?

669
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:53,902
- How d'you know he's actin'?
- Who told you?

670
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:55,633
I was told. People talk!

671
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:57,205
Watch your tone!

672
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:58,970
I know what's goin' on!

673
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,512
What?
You think I'm up to somethin'?

674
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,552
Just a second!

675
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:07,289
I'm not mouthin' off.
People have told me about her.

676
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,450
Me neither. Let me speak.

677
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:12,927
Turn the heat on Rachid, okay.
That bastard,

678
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:15,498
he dumped us at the last minute.

679
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,362
He backed out of the play.

680
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,868
So see him and quit hasslin' us.

681
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,475
Watch your mouth.
You got it in for him or what?

682
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,905
He has his life, he's a busy guy.

683
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,312
He has other interests.
Me for instance.

684
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:33,080
Know what our dates were?
Rehearsals. I'm glad he stopped.

685
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,854
He has a life too, outside you.

686
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:40,251
Who d'you mean, "you"?
He should just keep his word!

687
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,422
So? You've replaced him.
You've got Krimo now.

688
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,123
Hey, let people speak!

689
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:48,168
Chill out, quit raggin' each other.

690
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:50,130
Forget Rachid...

691
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,102
Guys like you piss me off.

692
00:36:52,308 --> 00:36:53,939
- You hot for him?
- No way!

693
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:57,049
If I did,
I'd have gone out with him, right?

694
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:58,584
He asked you?

695
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:01,147
No, but I'd have asked him out.

696
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,445
You bet.

697
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:07,257
Cut it out,
I've known Krimo forever.

698
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,960
He's my homey.

699
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:12,359
You thought I'd jump on him?
I'm not some nympho.

700
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:13,965
Chill out, okay.

701
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,601
Old homies like them don't go out.

702
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,671
I hope not.

703
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,641
Hey, girl, she don't report to you.

704
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:25,345
She said she ain't hot for him.

705
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,518
Instead of hasslin' us,
why not go see Krimo?

706
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:30,980
Yeah, quit bustin' our balls.

707
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:32,918
You bet she will.

708
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:35,251
She ain't hot for him. What now?

709
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,587
She keeps her hands off him!

710
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:39,118
You get me?

711
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,197
Why keep sayin' "she"?
Talk to her direct.

712
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,427
You speak for her!

713
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,333
Talk and cease the hassle.

714
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,202
She gets the message.

715
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,206
Go on, talk to her.

716
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,408
She gets the message.

717
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,638
Got it, Lydia?

718
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:57,042
You think I'll shut up
and listen to this shit?

719
00:37:57,218 --> 00:38:00,415
Who d'you think I am?
Think I'll just take it?

720
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:02,021
Stand up...

721
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:04,152
I'll jus' say one thing.

722
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,589
You don't touch him, he's mine.

723
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:08,559
Get my meanin'? He's mine.

724
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,424
You don't talk to him,

725
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,968
touch him or come onto him

726
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:15,663
like I heard you were,
with all the rest.

727
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,167
What is this?

728
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:20,971
You think I'll stand by
and let you steal my guy?

729
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:21,669
You broke up!

730
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,239
You dumped him.
Why come bustin' her balls?

731
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,881
Go piss him off instead!

732
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:31,419
I've been with him 2 years.
We were hot for each other.

733
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,357
And I'm still hot for him.

734
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:36,259
Take care of your guy
and leave mine be!

735
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:39,093
I told you, he doesn't interest me!

736
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:41,497
Find yourself a guy that's single.

737
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:45,034
What is all this?
Why're you hasslin' me?

738
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,271
- You slut!
- Come back here!

739
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:49,103
What d'you want?

740
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:51,439
All you do all day is insult me?

741
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:52,842
Find another guy!

742
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:54,277
- I'm a slut?
- Yeah!

743
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,611
You take other girl's guys.

744
00:38:56,953 --> 00:38:59,255
Your guy? He's your ex!

745
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,018
You suicidal, girl?

746
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:03,394
You are if you touch him!

747
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:06,532
Suicidal, me?
I'll fuckin' waste you, bitch!

748
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,595
I'll whack you and your family!

749
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:13,133
I don't steal guys,
I'm no slut, you get it?

750
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:14,603
Callin' me a slut?

751
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:16,668
Wow, tough girl!

752
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:19,303
I'm a slut?
Want me to whack you?

753
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:22,951
I jus' came to warn you.
Next time, I'll whack you.

754
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,145
Forget her, Lydia.
We'll catch her later.

755
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,552
Make your mind up!

756
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:30,052
She'll wipe the floor with her.

757
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:33,355
She'll end up in the ER.
That's what you want?

758
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,490
You tell her to stand up
and now back off?

759
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:40,899
She comes hasslin' us,
then starts weepin'!

760
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:44,268
- What'll fightin' change?
- It'll shut her up.

761
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:49,439
- Someone'll jus' get hurt.
- She thinks she's Miss World!

762
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:53,485
Krimo doesn't give a shit.
And she says he's hot for her!

763
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,054
Krimo don't care!

764
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:58,386
Like I said,
she should talk it over with him.

765
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,928
Understand her! You're chicks too.
You have hearts, right?

766
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:07,224
She's heated. She won't give in.
She's still hot for him!

767
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:10,667
So she sees Krimo.
She don't bust Lydia's balls.

768
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:12,438
She goes see Krimo.

769
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,374
Who'd want a dog like her?

770
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,275
My brother, he sees her,
he spits on her.

771
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:21,152
On the Koran!
She makes trouble for nothing.

772
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,886
Yeah, and 'cause of her,
we're fightin' now. You're crazy!

773
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:28,691
So, girl, you hot for him or not?

774
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,454
You after him or not?

775
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:36,324
- No way.
- There, that's settled.

776
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,941
Okay, Lydia, you know
you've done nothing wrong

777
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:43,111
but she's one mean bitch.
Watch her, okay?

778
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:46,008
Hey, Krimo!

779
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,383
Hello, ma'am.

780
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,650
Hello, Fathi!

781
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:00,222
- How are you?
- Fine.

782
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:02,021
Your husband?

783
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,238
You said I'd come
to the islands with you?

784
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:11,701
I was thinkin'...

785
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,978
Is he still in D block?

786
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:16,510
I'm askin'

787
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:20,378
because my sister's husband, Jacky,

788
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:23,021
is being transferred,
my sister said.

789
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,180
- Really?
- Yeah, to Fresnes.

790
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:27,458
He got his transfer papers.

791
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,895
I know your husband and Jacky
get along.

792
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,060
I thought he'd be pleased.

793
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,205
You'll tell him?

794
00:41:36,106 --> 00:41:37,368
Yes, I'll tell him.

795
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,642
And say I said "Hi".

796
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,478
- I'll do that. How are you?
- I'm okay.

797
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,307
No worries.

798
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,449
Could you get your son for me?

799
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,174
Hold on, I'll call him.

800
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:56,523
Abdelkrim!

801
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,062
Fathi's here.

802
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,396
Go on, he's waiting.

803
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,973
- Okay?
- What's crackin'?

804
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,987
- Where were you, fucker?
- At home.

805
00:42:20,192 --> 00:42:21,489
You moved out or what?

806
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:25,289
I was thinkin'...

807
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,467
I've got this hot skin flick,
you have to see it.

808
00:42:32,938 --> 00:42:35,998
A blazin' movie, believe me,
full of hot bitches...

809
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:38,369
- I can't.
- All-out fuckin'.

810
00:42:38,577 --> 00:42:40,636
- I have stuff to do.
- Listen...

811
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,711
Guess what else?

812
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:44,948
There's a hard-core tape.

813
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,553
Hard-core, straight up.

814
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:50,320
Caribbean babes and all,
you pop a fuse.

815
00:42:50,593 --> 00:42:53,460
The guys'll get together
and jerk off.

816
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:57,123
A real jerk-fest.

817
00:42:57,766 --> 00:43:00,132
We'll spray the fuckin' walls!

818
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:03,100
- I can't, okay.
- How come?

819
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:05,263
Cut the crap. Why can't you?

820
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:07,970
- I have stuff to do.
- C'mon!

821
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:10,473
Is it Magali?

822
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,108
Is it her?

823
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,548
No kiddin'? You fucker...

824
00:43:15,455 --> 00:43:17,514
You won't come over?

825
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,090
You sure? Never mind.

826
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:22,352
Do your thing, bro.

827
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:41,015
- Is Lydia there, please?
- I'll get her for you.

828
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,051
Everythin' cool? Feelin' good?

829
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:15,147
I'm okay...

830
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:18,986
Learnin' Arlequin?

831
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:22,128
I can't do it.
You know, I learn it

832
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,825
but I lose it again right away.

833
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:28,164
The lines are too long.
My memory's not so hot.

834
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,235
Memory's nothing.

835
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:32,837
C'mon, memory's vital!

836
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:35,774
No way.
It's tough at first, only natural,

837
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:38,177
but then it all comes together.

838
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:40,051
Got a smoke?

839
00:44:41,086 --> 00:44:42,383
I'm the same.

840
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:45,955
Know what?
I was scared at first too.

841
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,821
I really freaked out.

842
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,193
At first, I thought,
"Shit, this is too tough."

843
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,096
You think it comes naturally?

844
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:55,930
She freaked out at first.

845
00:44:56,105 --> 00:45:00,007
She worked, learned her lines,
her moves. Now she's good.

846
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:03,474
Yeah, it's like she says,
it all comes together.

847
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:05,471
I was thinkin'...

848
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:06,879
Got a light?

849
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:14,953
I was thinkin'...
Can you come over?

850
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:19,857
I have to go over my lines
but I don't understand them.

851
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:21,795
You see, I learn

852
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:24,128
but those lines are bastards.

853
00:45:24,337 --> 00:45:26,134
Can you help me later?

854
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,938
Show me all the stuff you know.

855
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:33,306
The gestures and all that shit
to get into the character.

856
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:34,912
Tell him.

857
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:37,516
We're goin' to a concert, see.

858
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:40,152
- You are?
- Yeah, she can't come.

859
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:44,050
That's why.

860
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:46,055
Anyhow, there's no rush.

861
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:50,264
Besides, it's best to start
with the teacher.

862
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:51,764
She knows stuff.

863
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:55,803
If I give you advice too,
it'll mess up your head.

864
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,468
Jus' do what she tells you
to start off.

865
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:02,141
After, Inch'Allah, it'll work out.

866
00:46:02,312 --> 00:46:04,079
She knows some crazy shit.

867
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:07,914
She's been on stage,
she's acted in musicals,

868
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:11,217
tragedies and all that.
Ask her for advice.

869
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:14,394
Lydia knows stuff
but not like the teacher does.

870
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:18,292
She can help you.
You need to listen to her first.

871
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,001
It's true. The teacher's a pro.

872
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,735
I dunno.

873
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:26,099
Gimme the lighter.

874
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:28,845
Why don't you ask Magali?

875
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:31,145
Why Magali?

876
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,513
She likes actin'.
She was in a play in sixth grade.

877
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:39,455
She's not busy, she can help you.

878
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:43,524
If you want advice, go see her.

879
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:45,489
Gimme the lighter.

880
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,459
I mean, don't start
by messin' your head up, okay?

881
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:57,409
- Your smoke.
- Gimme a break.

882
00:46:57,613 --> 00:46:59,774
Put it out before we go in.

883
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:04,085
- Not there!
- Do I give a shit?

884
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:10,348
Your fuckin' sister!

885
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:12,483
- Ball-buster.
- Shut up!

886
00:47:12,828 --> 00:47:13,988
Still got the tape?

887
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,465
I don't give a shit.
Fuck you, you faggots!

888
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:19,062
Don't say that.

889
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:21,331
Your sister said it was cool.

890
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:23,165
How's it goin'?

891
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,309
Magali! Come here.

892
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:37,517
What's goin' on with Krimo?

893
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:39,788
We split up.

894
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:41,320
What d'you mean?

895
00:47:41,594 --> 00:47:43,259
It's over.

896
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:48,997
Sure, like usual:
You split up, you get back together.

897
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:53,435
- You say no?
- It's over for good.

898
00:47:53,944 --> 00:47:56,811
Why d'you say that?
You had the big fight?

899
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:01,914
You wanna tell me why?

900
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:05,119
I never saw him no more.
He was doin'...

901
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:09,122
He was doin' weird shit.

902
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:10,953
Since when?

903
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:12,427
A long time.

904
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:14,895
I didn't even know.

905
00:48:15,636 --> 00:48:17,501
He never told me.

906
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,170
I dunno, maybe he doesn't care.

907
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,473
He doesn't care?
He's always talkin' about you.

908
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:27,912
He does my head in with you.
And he don't care?

909
00:48:28,082 --> 00:48:28,878
I dunno.

910
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:34,321
A homey, he tells me,
"I'm gonna take my woman

911
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:38,929
"on trips, buy her gifts,
all that shit..."

912
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,131
And you come tellin' me
he don't care...

913
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:45,870
No, stop sayin' that!

914
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:48,531
The guy does my head in with you.

915
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:52,502
He talks about you 24/7.

916
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:55,210
"That chick's one hot woman...

917
00:48:56,281 --> 00:48:59,015
"She's one real hot woman and all.

918
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,087
"A once-in-a-lifetime chick."

919
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,324
I say, "Quit messin' your head up
with her."

920
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:10,830
Go see him, talk to him,
it'll do you good.

921
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:14,134
No, it'll be no use.

922
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,971
Somethin' must be botherin' him.

923
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:19,402
I didn't see him for a week either.

924
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,940
There's a reason he's stayin' away.

925
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:24,210
I dunno if you heard,

926
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:28,217
his old man's goin' on trial
and it's lookin' bad.

927
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:30,412
He has other shit in mind, I guess.

928
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:34,518
Don't worry.
Want me to talk to him?

929
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:36,225
I dunno.

930
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:40,966
You want me to talk to him or not?
Just say yes or no.

931
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:43,428
Well?

932
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:47,028
Yeah? I'll talk to him.

933
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:49,201
- I didn't send you.
- Okay.

934
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:50,938
See you.

935
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,315
All right, let's go.

936
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,514
Shut your mouth, I'm talkin'!

937
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:22,143
Ready?

938
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:28,384
Your turn. Relax.
Don't worry, it's your first time.

939
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,820
Take it slowly. Okay?
Off you go.

940
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:35,894
Any time...
Whenever you're ready.

941
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,633
Madame, he tells me...

942
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:44,570
He tells me to be patient.
He speaks most easily.

943
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,508
I find your impatience
most implausible.

944
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,310
It is mere gallantry

945
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,077
that you display here.

946
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,585
Love can't be so strong

947
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,389
so soon after being born!

948
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,320
You're mistaken, fair wonder,

949
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,623
such love soon leaves its cradle.

950
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:07,025
One look from you created it,
two made it strong

951
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:08,600
and three made it grow.

952
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:11,531
Take care of it
for you are its mother.

953
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:13,196
Just a second...

954
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,878
You know your lines.
That's good but...

955
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,647
you should try
to speak more clearly, okay?

956
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:22,472
You're rushing it.
Take your time.

957
00:51:24,486 --> 00:51:27,547
Let's do it bit by bit.
Start again.

958
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:30,293
"You're mistaken, fair wonder..."

959
00:51:31,197 --> 00:51:32,630
You're mistaken, fair wonder...

960
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,160
That's not what I said. Listen.

961
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:38,837
"You're mistaken, fair wonder..."

962
00:51:39,572 --> 00:51:41,039
Any punctuation there?

963
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:44,839
What punctuation?

964
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:46,909
A comma.

965
00:51:47,113 --> 00:51:50,378
Good, a comma. What do you do
in French after a comma?

966
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,016
You have to stop.

967
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:53,246
You pause.

968
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:54,650
A pause.

969
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:56,619
Start again.

970
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,427
"You're mistaken..."

971
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:02,489
You're mistaken, fair wonder,

972
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:06,659
such love soon leaves its cradle.

973
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:09,096
One look from you created it,

974
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:10,863
two made it strong

975
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,235
and three made it grow.

976
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,646
Lisette now.

977
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:20,378
"Is it mistreated..."

978
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:24,181
Is it mistreated, abandoned so?

979
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,988
For now, simply give it
your dainty hand

980
00:52:28,195 --> 00:52:29,492
to amuse it a little.

981
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,894
Should we not show reason?

982
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,397
Reason? I have none!

983
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:36,195
Your eyes stole it.

984
00:52:37,004 --> 00:52:39,404
That's almost it.
"Reason? I have lost it."

985
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,635
But that doesn't matter.
You know all the rest.

986
00:52:48,052 --> 00:52:51,078
One thing, it's a bit glum.
Maybe you don't realize.

987
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:55,123
He's merry, he's lively,
he's in love.

988
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:56,590
She's beautiful,

989
00:52:56,928 --> 00:52:59,920
so you need more joy, okay?

990
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:05,224
It needs more exuberance,
more happiness, okay? Less...

991
00:53:05,603 --> 00:53:07,264
Can you manage that?

992
00:53:07,573 --> 00:53:10,238
If you can, do it next time.
Work on it.

993
00:53:33,906 --> 00:53:35,840
Hold on, I'm checkin' somethin'.

994
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,418
All right.

995
00:53:47,253 --> 00:53:48,413
The audience is here

996
00:53:48,587 --> 00:53:51,249
and the stage here.
These are the chairs.

997
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:55,118
You're not on stage yet.
You'll be on soon.

998
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,431
Okay, I'll explain.

999
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,131
Okay, you see, I'm on stage
and I'm fanning myself.

1000
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,675
Then you come on
and I don't see you.

1001
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,202
Let's go.

1002
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,039
And now, my queen...

1003
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,153
Hold on, you're too...
Stand like this.

1004
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,913
They won't see you.

1005
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,886
The audience is there, okay?

1006
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,429
You have to get
that sort of reflex right away.

1007
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,589
Try again.

1008
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,868
Go on, start again.

1009
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:34,202
Concentrate.
Focus on the character.

1010
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,371
You're Arlequin, okay.

1011
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:37,838
Go on.

1012
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:42,609
- Know what'd be better?
- What?

1013
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:46,045
You fake
like you don't see me either.

1014
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:47,614
Back up.

1015
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:49,487
You come on there.

1016
00:54:50,061 --> 00:54:53,360
I fake like I don't see you
but you don't either.

1017
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:55,464
Arlequin doesn't see her.

1018
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,159
I fan myself,
you look at the chandelier.

1019
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,600
And then you come on, okay?

1020
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:03,964
- Go on.
- What chandelier?

1021
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,038
Any chandelier...

1022
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:08,473
I dunno. You imagine one.

1023
00:55:09,046 --> 00:55:10,035
See that cloud?

1024
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:13,379
Look at that

1025
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:16,614
or at that tree there.
See where Momo lives?

1026
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,950
Momo's place
is the chandelier, okay?

1027
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:22,925
Imagine a chandelier
in your mind, okay?

1028
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:46,281
Krimo, don't take forever!

1029
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,393
And now, my queen, I stay

1030
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:56,500
for I need your presence
yet you avoid mine.

1031
00:55:56,668 --> 00:55:59,102
Hold on, can you try somethin'?

1032
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:02,240
Don't take it badly, okay.
I'll say it...

1033
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:04,937
"And now, my queen, I stay

1034
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:07,014
"for I need your presence..."

1035
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:09,447
You act like you don't give a shit.

1036
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:13,388
The guy's freakin' out, okay?
He's scared.

1037
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:15,456
Show 'em you're scared.

1038
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:20,186
Try to make it more...
I don't know, take your time...

1039
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:21,625
Act like you...

1040
00:56:22,198 --> 00:56:23,825
See what I mean or not?

1041
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,871
I told you to get
inside the character, so try, okay?

1042
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,167
Let's start again.

1043
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:43,589
And now, my queen, I stay

1044
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:47,087
for I need your presence
yet you avoid mine.

1045
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,320
I must admit, monsieur,
that was indeed true.

1046
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,124
Sweet elixir of my heart...

1047
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:54,271
Remember what I said?

1048
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:56,429
- Who are you?
- Arlequin.

1049
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:58,336
So what's he like? Merry.

1050
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:01,375
Go on, you're Arlequin.
Look here.

1051
00:57:01,545 --> 00:57:03,069
"Sweet elixir of my heart,

1052
00:57:03,247 --> 00:57:05,408
"you wish for my demise?"
You're surprised.

1053
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,909
Try "Sweet elixir..."
Act like you're surprised.

1054
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,678
See what I mean? Go on.

1055
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,621
Sweet elixir of my heart,
you wish for my demise?

1056
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:18,699
It's good when you're surprised.

1057
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:22,028
You put more energy into it.
Go on.

1058
00:57:22,203 --> 00:57:23,602
Sweet elixir of my heart,

1059
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:25,372
you wish for my demise?

1060
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,872
No, your life is precious to me.

1061
00:57:28,243 --> 00:57:29,335
Heartening words!

1062
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:32,037
You must not doubt my feelings.

1063
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:33,441
I would seize...

1064
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:35,505
With Rachid,

1065
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:39,586
after he said that,
Arlequin would sit down.

1066
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:41,946
So when you say that, sit down.

1067
00:57:42,323 --> 00:57:43,191
There.

1068
00:57:45,097 --> 00:57:46,064
Go on.

1069
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,864
I would seize those words
on your lips...

1070
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,129
- That's wrong.
- "With my lips".

1071
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:57,241
And Rachid would sit down
at that bit,

1072
00:57:57,409 --> 00:58:01,402
then Arlequin would move closer
and Lisette would shy away.

1073
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:03,943
We did that and it worked.

1074
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:05,411
Okay? Understand?

1075
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:06,651
Go on.

1076
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,550
I would seize those words
on your lips...

1077
00:58:11,727 --> 00:58:14,560
Not, "on your lips",
"with my lips".

1078
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:16,523
You say, "on your lips".

1079
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,359
You see the difference?

1080
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:21,469
You have to move closer
or I can't shy away.

1081
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:23,272
Go on.

1082
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:26,169
I would seize those words
on your lips...

1083
00:58:26,342 --> 00:58:28,105
"With my lips"!

1084
00:58:28,277 --> 00:58:29,437
Same difference.

1085
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:30,977
It's not the same!

1086
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,948
Look.
"I would seize those words

1087
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:35,485
"with my lips."

1088
00:58:35,655 --> 00:58:38,954
"With my lips" and "on your lips"
isn't the same.

1089
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,526
The writer put "with my lips"
and we don't change it.

1090
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:46,899
If you change stuff, I will too.
I'll say anything.

1091
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:49,258
It's not possible. You see that?

1092
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:50,466
Go on.

1093
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:54,905
I would seize those words
with my lips.

1094
00:58:55,075 --> 00:58:59,209
Since your proposal,
I have awaited my father's reply.

1095
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,981
I spoke to him

1096
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:05,315
and I can tell you
that you may ask for my hand.

1097
00:59:06,624 --> 00:59:10,151
Before I ask him,
allow me to ask you.

1098
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:14,263
I wish to pay tribute
to the kindness he shows...

1099
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,023
You're mumblin' too much.

1100
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,190
Forgotten it?

1101
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:21,035
What's wrong?

1102
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,044
What?

1103
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:53,669
My fuckin' dress!

1104
01:00:05,323 --> 01:00:06,984
What came over you?

1105
01:00:08,293 --> 01:00:09,385
Nothin'!

1106
01:00:10,295 --> 01:00:12,526
I wanna go out with you,
that's all.

1107
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:20,566
Well?

1108
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,369
Will you?

1109
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:31,516
Well?

1110
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:34,319
I dunno.

1111
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,455
I mean, I dunno.

1112
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:43,532
I mean, I've known you forever.

1113
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,560
I dunno, okay?

1114
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:50,065
I never imagined this.

1115
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,178
I didn't know you'd ask me that.

1116
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:57,578
I thought we were homies.
I never expected you to ask that.

1117
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:01,249
Well? Yes or no?

1118
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:05,985
What about Magali?

1119
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,828
- It's over.
- C'mon!

1120
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,331
You know it's not...

1121
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:15,564
- I wouldn't say it's over.
- It's over, okay.

1122
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,877
I mean, I have to think.
I dunno.

1123
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,948
What d'you mean?

1124
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,783
I need to think, okay?
We can't rush into this.

1125
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:34,424
Know what? I'm gonna head home.
I'll call you.

1126
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:37,227
No, now, don't waste your credit.

1127
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:43,096
I'll call you, okay?

1128
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,139
- Okay?
- When'll you tell me?

1129
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,807
I dunno. After I think it over.

1130
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,153
You think I can tell you right now?

1131
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,311
Not possible, brother.

1132
01:01:59,891 --> 01:02:02,451
I'll call you
when my head's straight.

1133
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,354
I'll go now and tell you later.

1134
01:02:05,997 --> 01:02:07,328
I'm goin'.

1135
01:02:29,158 --> 01:02:30,455
Here she comes...

1136
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,597
What's up?

1137
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:38,365
Did it go well? Tell us.

1138
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:41,863
Well, we rehearsed.

1139
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:44,566
- Was it wicked?
- It was fine.

1140
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:46,206
- Was it good?
- Yeah.

1141
01:02:46,946 --> 01:02:48,004
Tell us about it.

1142
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:51,281
Tell you what?
We jus' did the scene, okay?

1143
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,578
He said nothin' mystic, like?

1144
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:54,920
Straight off!

1145
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,516
You guys are depraved.

1146
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,583
All he said was, "You're cute."

1147
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,853
- No, I dodged him, okay.
- I smell a rat...

1148
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,521
Are you crazy or what?

1149
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:09,929
I thanked him and moved along.
We were rehearsin'.

1150
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,438
We rehearsed.
What could he say?

1151
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,941
I told him to finish the scene.

1152
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:17,045
- You stopped him dead?
- No.

1153
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:20,079
We finished the scene.

1154
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,377
Any good?
In class, he was shit.

1155
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:23,814
I'm here, okay.

1156
01:03:23,987 --> 01:03:25,113
- Bitch...
- It's true.

1157
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:26,813
I'm jus' bein' honest.

1158
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,959
Look, I was givin' him advice.

1159
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,354
See what I mean?

1160
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:33,830
He got better bit by bit.

1161
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:35,559
- Bit by bit?
- Yeah, the more...

1162
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,167
we rehearsed,
the better he got.

1163
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:41,900
Inch'Allah, he'll get better
bit by bit, like.

1164
01:03:42,076 --> 01:03:44,840
- He'll be good.
- I hope so for you.

1165
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:47,344
Inch'Allah, he'll be good in the end.

1166
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:50,141
I'm headin' home, girls, I'm beat.

1167
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,921
We'll come for you tomorrow.

1168
01:03:54,088 --> 01:03:55,521
See you, Lydia.

1169
01:03:56,424 --> 01:03:59,363
- Did you notice?
- That star attitude...

1170
01:03:59,564 --> 01:04:01,828
That's why I winked.
You got it.

1171
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:05,828
- He didn't jus' say "You're cute."
- Right on.

1172
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:09,371
He's had the guts to tell her,
that's a good start.

1173
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:15,310
Hey, it's Krimo.

1174
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:18,041
What's up, Krimo?

1175
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:20,649
- Come on.
- I'm goin' to see dad.

1176
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:22,982
Tell him "Hi".

1177
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:30,394
I don't know
what's with Krimo these days.

1178
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,531
He's hot for a chick.

1179
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,998
Magali? There's trouble there.

1180
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:40,471
What're you talkin' about?
Magali?

1181
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:43,304
- That's ancient history.
- What?

1182
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,312
He's hot for Lydia.
She's flat as a board!

1183
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,545
- Who's she?
- A chick in my class.

1184
01:04:48,888 --> 01:04:50,549
He's dead hot for her.

1185
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:54,621
I heard something about Krimo.
He's wicked hot for a chick.

1186
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:57,361
He's all lovey-dovey.
Who is she?

1187
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,088
She's in my class,

1188
01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:02,563
flat as a board, no tits,
no ass, nada.

1189
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:03,960
A piece of shit.

1190
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,462
She's dead plain

1191
01:05:05,638 --> 01:05:09,540
and does this actin' shit,
just like Krimo too now.

1192
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:14,245
Hold on, run that by me again.

1193
01:05:14,418 --> 01:05:17,979
He's actin' now, Krimo is.
I promise you.

1194
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:22,182
Shut your mouth, okay,
you don't talk shit like that.

1195
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:25,886
I swear he's actin' now,
you think I'm lyin'?

1196
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,988
You don't believe me?

1197
01:05:28,865 --> 01:05:31,561
They do actin',
old-style, Middle Ages stuff.

1198
01:05:32,402 --> 01:05:35,371
He's in disguise too,
dressed like a fag.

1199
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:37,006
A real fag!

1200
01:05:37,174 --> 01:05:39,544
That Lydia's a real clown too.

1201
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:43,548
They do
all that hand-kissing' shit.

1202
01:05:43,884 --> 01:05:48,184
He kisses her like this,
bends to kiss her hand. Crazy!

1203
01:05:48,556 --> 01:05:50,353
What a sucker. Forget him.

1204
01:05:50,524 --> 01:05:52,048
Why you sayin' this?

1205
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:55,389
It's the truth, he's hot for her.

1206
01:05:55,596 --> 01:06:00,431
He's dead hot for her,
he'd get down on all fours for her.

1207
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:04,338
In class, he don't see
nobody but her.

1208
01:06:04,509 --> 01:06:07,273
You call him and he don't reply.

1209
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:08,639
He's hot for her.

1210
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:11,004
That ho's turned his brain.

1211
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:15,084
Yeah, it's like he's blind,
not seein' anythin'.

1212
01:06:15,253 --> 01:06:19,553
When I'm in class, I see them.
He's a desperate case.

1213
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:22,951
What are we gonna do?
I mean...

1214
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:24,560
Forget it.

1215
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,488
He's hot for her, okay.

1216
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:28,860
She hot for him?

1217
01:06:29,605 --> 01:06:33,302
Know what?
Truth is, I don't think so.

1218
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:37,309
She's got him by the balls
but she's not hot for him.

1219
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,246
If she was hot,
she wouldn't put him through that.

1220
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:44,817
He falls for everythin'.

1221
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:47,547
He's acting all la-de-da.
God knows why.

1222
01:06:47,923 --> 01:06:49,618
It drives me wild.

1223
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:04,218
No, forget the chandelier, please.

1224
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:06,921
She's beautiful,
you've missed her...

1225
01:07:07,098 --> 01:07:10,261
The chandelier's beautiful
but you don't see it.

1226
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:18,236
And now, my queen, I stay

1227
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:20,644
for I need your presence
yet you avoid mine.

1228
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:22,673
Another chandelier?

1229
01:07:23,018 --> 01:07:26,647
It's just you're looking
at your feet now. Look at her.

1230
01:07:28,524 --> 01:07:30,014
Go on.

1231
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,126
And now, my queen, I stay

1232
01:07:33,295 --> 01:07:36,321
for I need your presence
yet you avoid mine.

1233
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:42,026
I must admit, monsieur,
that was indeed true.

1234
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,843
Heartening words!

1235
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,006
"Sweet elixir of my heart..."

1236
01:07:50,383 --> 01:07:52,817
Sweet elixir of my heart,

1237
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,544
you wish for my demise?

1238
01:07:54,887 --> 01:07:56,878
No, your life is precious to me.

1239
01:07:57,557 --> 01:07:59,252
Heartening words!

1240
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,292
- You're doing it on purpose!
- What?

1241
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,360
You're reeling off the lines
without conviction.

1242
01:08:07,534 --> 01:08:10,631
"Heartening words!"
We've been over this.

1243
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:14,440
- From the top?
- No.

1244
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:16,238
"I must admit..."

1245
01:08:17,881 --> 01:08:20,475
I must admit, monsieur,
that was indeed true.

1246
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:22,945
Sweet elixir of my heart...

1247
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,214
Keep your eyes on her then,
not on the audience.

1248
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:30,789
"I must admit that was true,
I was avoiding you."

1249
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:33,263
"Did you no longer wish to see me?"

1250
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,196
Start again.

1251
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:40,869
Sweet elixir of my heart,

1252
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:42,407
you wish for my demise?

1253
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:45,135
No, your life is precious to me.

1254
01:08:45,312 --> 01:08:47,542
Heartening words!

1255
01:08:47,882 --> 01:08:49,611
Have fun!

1256
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:54,210
That's all I can tell you.
Have fun! This is funny.

1257
01:08:54,388 --> 01:08:56,618
There's a happy mood, see.

1258
01:08:56,957 --> 01:09:00,055
He's disguised as a master
with all that means:

1259
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:02,392
Someone with power in other words.

1260
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:07,069
Try to play someone with power,
try to show off!

1261
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:10,173
Put more energy into it!
You see what I mean?

1262
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:12,502
Try to reach something else.

1263
01:09:12,877 --> 01:09:15,141
Leave yourself
to reach a new language.

1264
01:09:15,513 --> 01:09:16,878
He's aping someone.

1265
01:09:17,048 --> 01:09:19,881
Can you see how important
the language is?

1266
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:22,178
Arlequin is mimicking a master!

1267
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:24,416
Go on, make an effort!

1268
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:31,459
From the top?

1269
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,426
"I must admit..." Go on.

1270
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:36,230
Stop turning to me
to see what to do.

1271
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:41,333
I must admit, monsieur,
that was indeed true.

1272
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,908
Sweet elixir of my heart,

1273
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,478
you wish for my demise?

1274
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:48,051
No, your life is precious to me.

1275
01:09:48,454 --> 01:09:50,615
- Heartening...
- More!

1276
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:53,617
More...

1277
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:58,522
Are you having fun?
Are you enjoying this?

1278
01:10:03,136 --> 01:10:04,160
Yes...

1279
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:09,338
You have to enjoy the fact
of leaving yourself behind.

1280
01:10:09,976 --> 01:10:10,943
Leave yourself!

1281
01:10:11,911 --> 01:10:14,645
Have fun, find the pleasure in it.

1282
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:18,011
Change your language,
the way you speak or move...

1283
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:19,985
Have fun!

1284
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,850
Where from?

1285
01:10:25,562 --> 01:10:28,292
"My father", just before the hand.

1286
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:32,364
Since your proposal,

1287
01:10:32,536 --> 01:10:35,164
I have awaited my father's reply.

1288
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:37,135
I spoke to him

1289
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:39,245
and I can tell you

1290
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,177
that you may ask for my hand.

1291
01:10:42,616 --> 01:10:45,107
Before I ask him,
allow me to ask you.

1292
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:48,278
I wish to pray tribute
to the kindness...

1293
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:50,919
...pay tribute
to the kindness

1294
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:53,525
of which I am unworthy...

1295
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:55,092
Of which...

1296
01:10:55,262 --> 01:10:59,164
Kiss that hand, let yourself go!
You see what I mean?

1297
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,028
Just kiss it!

1298
01:11:01,202 --> 01:11:04,073
Her hand's beautiful.
Touch it, it's fantastic!

1299
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:07,572
You thought you'd lost her!
Kiss it, have fun!

1300
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:09,573
Give yourself!

1301
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:17,283
Start again.
I'm sorry, start again.

1302
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:28,095
Start again. Come on.

1303
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,898
Make an effort.

1304
01:11:47,322 --> 01:11:48,482
Fuck me!

1305
01:11:49,324 --> 01:11:50,916
It's dead today, huh?

1306
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:56,492
What's up with Magali?

1307
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:58,062
It's over.

1308
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:03,640
Fuck, you screwed up there.

1309
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,570
She was way sweet.

1310
01:12:07,046 --> 01:12:10,413
What came over you?
She was cute.

1311
01:12:11,183 --> 01:12:13,378
We had a good laugh with her.

1312
01:12:15,988 --> 01:12:18,051
She had real respect for you.

1313
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:21,720
When she went out, you knew
she wasn't into any shit.

1314
01:12:22,065 --> 01:12:24,363
It sucks.
Know what I imagined?

1315
01:12:24,534 --> 01:12:28,061
I saw us on a sailboat
with your babies,

1316
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:29,865
sailing round the world.

1317
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:34,441
It sucks. You see...
You shouldn't have.

1318
01:12:37,347 --> 01:12:38,405
Got anyone else?

1319
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:43,648
You're sure? Nobody?

1320
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:49,086
I heard you were hot for a chick,
on your knees to her,

1321
01:12:49,396 --> 01:12:51,455
doin' actin' like a fag.

1322
01:12:51,632 --> 01:12:52,894
Not anymore.

1323
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:56,264
Can't you see
you're gettin' yourself a shit rep?

1324
01:12:59,473 --> 01:13:02,237
Hey, Krimo,
you're my homey, okay.

1325
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:07,242
I've got you in mind,
I won't let you get fucked up.

1326
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:12,951
Goin' out with her?

1327
01:13:13,257 --> 01:13:16,158
No, I asked her
but she needs to think.

1328
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:17,658
What for?

1329
01:13:18,096 --> 01:13:19,688
She has to think.

1330
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:22,295
Who the hell does she think she is?

1331
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:26,026
Normally, you go see a chick
and ask her.

1332
01:13:26,237 --> 01:13:29,502
If she's hot for you,
she gives you an answer.

1333
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:33,409
How long does she need
to give a reply?

1334
01:13:34,116 --> 01:13:37,210
Stay with her, you're fucked.
She'll jinx you.

1335
01:13:38,353 --> 01:13:40,116
I've warned you.

1336
01:13:40,922 --> 01:13:42,412
Shoulda stayed with Magali.

1337
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:46,052
She's a straight chick at least.

1338
01:13:47,162 --> 01:13:49,926
I respected her, I swear.

1339
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:53,564
You fuckin' joker!

1340
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:59,737
You wished to complain about me.

1341
01:13:59,912 --> 01:14:01,379
For what reason?

1342
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:09,852
What can I say?
My anger will be unreserved.

1343
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:15,725
She believes so.
You may tell her of their bond.

1344
01:14:15,895 --> 01:14:17,226
I'll see to the rest.

1345
01:14:19,899 --> 01:14:22,962
We have nothing more
to say to each other.

1346
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,272
Ah, my dear...

1347
01:14:34,117 --> 01:14:35,311
Okay?

1348
01:14:38,288 --> 01:14:40,882
Last time, I waited for you.

1349
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:48,861
No sense in waitin', then.

1350
01:14:51,271 --> 01:14:53,205
We waited. You could've come.

1351
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,001
Never mind.

1352
01:14:59,346 --> 01:15:01,041
Me, you and Marianne.

1353
01:15:04,384 --> 01:15:06,443
I dunno yet.

1354
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,749
What's your problem?

1355
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:10,685
Your friend.

1356
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:12,291
What friend? Gimme that!

1357
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:14,124
You know, that ho Lydia.

1358
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:16,095
Watch what you're sayin'!

1359
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:17,734
She's a ho, okay.

1360
01:15:17,902 --> 01:15:19,392
What's your problem?

1361
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:22,028
- Back off!
- Watcha doin'?

1362
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,305
What? Gimme my cell back!

1363
01:15:24,642 --> 01:15:25,370
You're crazy!

1364
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:27,240
What is this shit?

1365
01:15:27,745 --> 01:15:30,771
This shit?
That ho's drivin' my homey crazy.

1366
01:15:31,182 --> 01:15:32,240
I mean Krimo.

1367
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:34,247
Who gives a shit about Krimo?

1368
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:35,942
Why you shoutin'?

1369
01:15:36,154 --> 01:15:38,217
It's not my problem, okay!

1370
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:40,657
What's it got to do with me?

1371
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:42,854
You're her friend, that's what.

1372
01:15:43,031 --> 01:15:45,022
Yeah, I'm her friend. So what?

1373
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,829
- So what?
- So you can talk to her.

1374
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:52,231
Krimo's old enough
to settle it himself.

1375
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:54,331
He's not, he needs me.

1376
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:57,338
I don't give a shit
about her or him!

1377
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,840
I thought he was with Magali!

1378
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:02,379
- Shut your mouth.
- Sure! Gimme my cell!

1379
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,121
He split with Magali for that ho!

1380
01:16:05,724 --> 01:16:07,817
- Who says she's a ho?
- Fuck that.

1381
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:09,722
- Just tell her...
- Screw you!

1382
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:11,692
Gimme back my cell, okay!

1383
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:15,299
You want your cell back,
you listen to me.

1384
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:18,436
Gimme the phone, then we can talk!

1385
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:24,001
You're pushin' it too far,
mouthin' off like this!

1386
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,642
This thing's between them.

1387
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:28,875
- What is this?
- Why're you yellin'?

1388
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,646
'Cause I want my fuckin' cell back!

1389
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:33,945
Stop it, please.

1390
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,683
You gonna stop me yellin'?
Back off!

1391
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,123
Quit mouthin' off.
Gimme my cell!

1392
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,923
- I'll get my big brother.
- Quit yellin'!

1393
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:45,066
My big brother'll nail you,
motherfucker!

1394
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:48,966
My big brother'll waste you!
What's your problem?

1395
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:50,331
He'll do what?

1396
01:16:50,673 --> 01:16:52,734
He'll nail you, motherfucker!

1397
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:55,414
- Shut the fuck up!
- Back off, okay,

1398
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,841
or I'll get really pissed!

1399
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:01,186
Fuckin' let go!

1400
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:02,712
Shut your mouth!

1401
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,914
Fuckin' let go, muhfuh!

1402
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:07,083
- Quit yellin'.
- Fuckin' let go!

1403
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:09,286
Quit yellin'. Listen to me.

1404
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:13,797
You and your friends carry on,
I'll fuckin' waste you.

1405
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:16,231
It's not my fuckin' problem, okay?

1406
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,738
You're crazy. Quit yellin'.

1407
01:17:19,277 --> 01:17:21,302
- What's your game?
- My game?

1408
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:24,676
Let go of my hand.
Fuckin' let go of my hand!

1409
01:17:25,049 --> 01:17:28,849
Know what you're gonna do?
Go see that filthy ho

1410
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:33,045
and tell her I'll waste her
unless she backs off my homey.

1411
01:17:33,224 --> 01:17:35,283
I don't give a shit. Let go!

1412
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:37,917
Chill or I'll clock you.

1413
01:17:38,129 --> 01:17:41,621
I'm blowin' a fuse too.
She's there, teasin' him...

1414
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,262
- You know the ho I mean?
- I know!

1415
01:17:44,906 --> 01:17:47,101
- I'll go see her, okay!
- Sure?

1416
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:48,299
I know who!

1417
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:50,838
Go see her and get her reply.

1418
01:17:51,012 --> 01:17:52,775
I hear you, now let go!

1419
01:17:52,947 --> 01:17:55,415
- Another?
- Let go, I'll tell her!

1420
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:59,049
You better
or I swear I'll waste you.

1421
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:01,921
Okay! Let go now!

1422
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,058
Watch it or I'll fuck you over.

1423
01:18:04,225 --> 01:18:06,250
Fuckin' let go of me!

1424
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:08,866
Fuck off! Keep away from me!
Gimme my cell!

1425
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:13,734
Gimme my fuckin' cell, you shit!
You fuckin' joker!

1426
01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:16,167
Not till I get the reply.

1427
01:18:16,342 --> 01:18:18,333
The reply?
You're fuckin' kiddin'!

1428
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:21,274
Fuck you,
fuckin' faggot motherfucker!

1429
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,642
Fuckin' scumbag!

1430
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:01,825
Nanou!

1431
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,930
Didn't you hear me?

1432
01:19:15,108 --> 01:19:17,008
What's up? Catch your breath.

1433
01:19:17,177 --> 01:19:20,806
That asshole came and attacked me!
He pounced on me!

1434
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:22,448
- Who?
- That bastard!

1435
01:19:22,818 --> 01:19:26,085
That fucker comes askin'
if I know Lydia. I say yes

1436
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:30,386
and he says to tell her
to stop windin' his homey Krimo up.

1437
01:19:30,728 --> 01:19:33,925
He says he wants a reply.
Do I give a toss?

1438
01:19:34,231 --> 01:19:35,892
I didn't know what to do.

1439
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:38,728
I kept tellin' him to keep back.

1440
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:41,929
- But then he slapped me!
- Who? Who d'you mean?

1441
01:19:42,406 --> 01:19:46,866
Fathi, that tall fucker
who lives in B7, Krimo's homey!

1442
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:48,948
He's gone too fuckin' far!

1443
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,677
A guy who beats a chick
is no real guy.

1444
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,788
He snatches my cell,
flings me to the ground,

1445
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,948
starts slappin' me
and stranglin' me and all!

1446
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,787
I couldn't even move!

1447
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,293
- He fuckin' beat me up!
- Why'd he do it?

1448
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,126
'Cause of that fuckin' cunt Lydia!

1449
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,791
He asked her to go out or somethin'.

1450
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,994
I didn't understand a thing.

1451
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,698
That bitch plays the slut
and I pay!

1452
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:16,211
She had to give a reply to Krimo
or somethin'.

1453
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,817
He was beatin' me
and that's all I understood.

1454
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:23,011
She's pushin' it,
she hassles and you get hit.

1455
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:24,813
You said it.

1456
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:27,220
Why's Fathi into their shit?

1457
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:31,123
I told him if it was their problem,
to go see Lydia.

1458
01:20:31,296 --> 01:20:35,733
He threatened me. He said
if she doesn't answer Krimo fast,

1459
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:37,997
- he'll fuck us over.
- Come on.

1460
01:20:38,174 --> 01:20:41,075
No, he beat it, he's gone.

1461
01:20:41,744 --> 01:20:43,075
He snatched my cell.

1462
01:20:44,213 --> 01:20:46,238
He took my fuckin' new cell!

1463
01:20:46,415 --> 01:20:48,815
My dad and brother'll hit the roof.

1464
01:20:48,985 --> 01:20:52,045
He'll ask where it is.
I'm in the shit here!

1465
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:57,284
And he won't give it back
"till she gives her reply," he says.

1466
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,894
What am I gonna do or say now?

1467
01:21:00,062 --> 01:21:03,433
My dad and my brother
are gonna hit the fuckin' roof!

1468
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,896
What'll you do?

1469
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:08,006
What can I do?
I'm gonna see that slut Lydia.

1470
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:09,198
Let's go, then.

1471
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:12,038
I don't get my cell
till she answers him.

1472
01:21:12,212 --> 01:21:14,874
She's gonna answer
or I'll slap the bitch!

1473
01:21:15,048 --> 01:21:18,882
And I'll set my big brother
on the fucker.

1474
01:21:38,509 --> 01:21:39,373
Lydia!

1475
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,444
- Is that you?
- Yeah, what's up?

1476
01:21:45,883 --> 01:21:46,907
Come down.

1477
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,411
Nano's here too.

1478
01:21:48,752 --> 01:21:49,810
Get down here!

1479
01:21:49,987 --> 01:21:51,511
Later, I'm workin' now.

1480
01:21:51,855 --> 01:21:53,052
No, right now!

1481
01:21:53,227 --> 01:21:55,195
Right now? Mom won't let me.

1482
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:57,923
I don't give a shit!
Get down here!

1483
01:21:58,766 --> 01:21:59,960
Cool it, okay.

1484
01:22:00,234 --> 01:22:01,394
We're waitin' here!

1485
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:03,298
I'm comin' down.

1486
01:22:08,376 --> 01:22:10,742
What? I came on too strong?

1487
01:22:10,912 --> 01:22:13,073
You lay into her on the intercom!

1488
01:22:13,281 --> 01:22:15,545
I should be nice? I got attacked!

1489
01:22:16,317 --> 01:22:18,312
Don't lay into her straight off.

1490
01:22:19,858 --> 01:22:21,792
You won't, okay?

1491
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:23,890
That's settled, then.

1492
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:40,775
You freaked me out,
yellin' like that.

1493
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:44,981
What's up?

1494
01:22:45,454 --> 01:22:46,921
Ask her.

1495
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:49,191
What's goin' on?

1496
01:22:49,358 --> 01:22:51,053
The shit you bring me!

1497
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:53,927
What's up with her? What is it?

1498
01:22:54,096 --> 01:22:56,087
Her cell got robbed jus' now.

1499
01:22:56,265 --> 01:22:57,197
Chill, okay.

1500
01:22:57,366 --> 01:22:59,095
I got mugged 'cause of you.

1501
01:22:59,268 --> 01:23:01,327
Explain instead of saying that.

1502
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,438
That clown Fathi attacked me.

1503
01:23:03,773 --> 01:23:06,970
He slapped me about,
tried to strangle me and all.

1504
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:09,247
He said you screwed Krimo up,

1505
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:13,441
that he's gone weird.
He kept hittin' and slappin' me!

1506
01:23:14,387 --> 01:23:16,548
What's this to do with me?

1507
01:23:16,923 --> 01:23:18,982
You got me a beatin', shithead!

1508
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:20,820
Quit layin' into me!

1509
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:22,985
She almost died 'cause of you.

1510
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:24,696
'Cause of me? Come on...

1511
01:23:24,864 --> 01:23:25,796
That's right!

1512
01:23:25,965 --> 01:23:28,263
It's not my fault. I did nothin'.

1513
01:23:29,869 --> 01:23:31,063
You did nothin'?

1514
01:23:31,237 --> 01:23:32,226
Sure, nothin'!

1515
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:33,775
You sure?

1516
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:37,275
Tell me what I did.

1517
01:23:37,514 --> 01:23:41,245
You wind him up, turn him on.
Sure, you did nothin'.

1518
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,082
Go on, you tell her.

1519
01:23:44,254 --> 01:23:45,380
You slut... Nothin'?

1520
01:23:45,556 --> 01:23:46,853
Watch your mouth!

1521
01:23:47,257 --> 01:23:51,421
You string the guy along
and who takes the rap? She does!

1522
01:23:51,762 --> 01:23:53,229
- It wasn't me!
- Shut it!

1523
01:23:53,397 --> 01:23:57,836
You say you're not hot for him
then you drag him around, you slut.

1524
01:23:58,004 --> 01:24:00,496
- Bitch!
- Watch it.

1525
01:24:00,842 --> 01:24:03,310
You turn the guy on
at every rehearsal,

1526
01:24:03,478 --> 01:24:05,503
then you say you did nothin'!

1527
01:24:06,981 --> 01:24:09,973
She's right. He started actin'
for your sakes.

1528
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:11,083
Did I ask him?

1529
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:14,881
Shut your mouth.
Krimo asked you out, right? Tell us.

1530
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:18,387
He asked you out. Fuckin' answer!

1531
01:24:19,227 --> 01:24:20,489
Yeah, I guess so.

1532
01:24:20,828 --> 01:24:22,227
Did he ask you or not?

1533
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,804
He asked but I didn't answer yet.

1534
01:24:27,973 --> 01:24:29,440
You slut, look at you.

1535
01:24:29,775 --> 01:24:31,367
Not even straight with us.

1536
01:24:31,543 --> 01:24:34,341
You never said.
You could've fuckin' told us!

1537
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:38,144
Not even me, your homey.

1538
01:24:39,317 --> 01:24:41,285
It's not that. The fucker asked me.

1539
01:24:41,453 --> 01:24:44,013
I didn't reply.
Should I tell the hood?

1540
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:47,791
We're not the hood.
I'm your homey, she is too.

1541
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:52,232
We're the hood?
We're other people?

1542
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:55,896
So, are you hot for him or not?

1543
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:58,505
D'you wanna go out with him
or not?

1544
01:24:59,175 --> 01:25:01,075
D'you want to or not?

1545
01:25:01,477 --> 01:25:02,842
It's your decision.

1546
01:25:09,018 --> 01:25:10,178
Yes or no?

1547
01:25:13,058 --> 01:25:14,083
But Magali...

1548
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,457
Magali's no excuse,
stop dodgin' the issue.

1549
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:20,095
Go there and tell him yes or no.

1550
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:22,461
We can't take a beatin' for you.

1551
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:24,899
Think it's funny, bitch?

1552
01:25:25,305 --> 01:25:28,866
Fathi comes hasslin' me,
I get mugged 'cause of you...

1553
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,168
Scared of Magali?

1554
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:33,103
The hell I'm scared of her!

1555
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:34,371
So?

1556
01:25:35,248 --> 01:25:36,806
She's hot for him.

1557
01:25:36,983 --> 01:25:39,387
You jus' want him gaspin' for you.

1558
01:25:39,756 --> 01:25:40,950
I'm not heartless.

1559
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:45,252
Call that bitch Magali.
Let's get this settled right now.

1560
01:25:45,429 --> 01:25:48,865
- I'm outta credit...
- Jus' call her, please.

1561
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,734
And get my cell back for me, slut.

1562
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:54,894
- Shut up!
- Watch your mouth.

1563
01:26:02,547 --> 01:26:03,847
What's goin' on?

1564
01:26:06,854 --> 01:26:08,446
You givin' up on Krimo?

1565
01:26:09,924 --> 01:26:11,050
Why? What's up?

1566
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:14,020
Krimo's not somethin'
you bought, okay?

1567
01:26:14,495 --> 01:26:16,486
He can be hot for another chick.

1568
01:26:16,864 --> 01:26:18,889
If he does, if she's straight,

1569
01:26:20,201 --> 01:26:22,863
you don't apply
the hassle and threats.

1570
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,469
It ain't fuckin' right.

1571
01:26:25,773 --> 01:26:27,766
I don't make threats, okay!

1572
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:31,438
I love Krimo and he loves me.
It'll always be that way.

1573
01:26:31,883 --> 01:26:33,851
Fuck, can't you see?

1574
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:37,954
How often have we broken up?

1575
01:26:38,356 --> 01:26:39,448
What happens?

1576
01:26:40,091 --> 01:26:41,422
We get back together.

1577
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:46,026
Who broke up? Was it him?

1578
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:48,060
No, I broke up.

1579
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:50,900
You'll get together?

1580
01:26:51,269 --> 01:26:54,470
Yeah, like always,
we always have done.

1581
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,904
We didn't break up,
we're takin' a breather.

1582
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:06,111
We give each other time to breathe,
then get back.

1583
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:08,017
A permanent breather.

1584
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:16,528
If he's hot for you,
why's he askin' her out?

1585
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:21,768
He asked you?

1586
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,139
Yeah, but I didn't answer.

1587
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:28,213
You didn't answer...

1588
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:34,819
What'll you tell him?

1589
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:37,421
Actually, I dunno. We'll see.

1590
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:40,185
What d'you mean?

1591
01:27:40,393 --> 01:27:41,758
We'll see.

1592
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:44,994
I knew anyhow.

1593
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:46,192
You knew what?

1594
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,530
I knew, that's all.

1595
01:27:47,938 --> 01:27:49,906
Stop thinkin' I came on to him.

1596
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,466
Sure.

1597
01:27:51,842 --> 01:27:52,968
I didn't, okay.

1598
01:27:55,212 --> 01:27:57,237
Maybe he wants to fuck her.

1599
01:27:58,015 --> 01:28:00,074
Save your crazy ideas, girl!

1600
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:04,284
Hold on, his homey, Fathi,
came and beat me up.

1601
01:28:04,454 --> 01:28:06,888
He gave me all this crazy hassle.

1602
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:09,387
He said my girl Lydia

1603
01:28:09,563 --> 01:28:12,896
isn't straight with Krimo,
she's makin' him crazy.

1604
01:28:13,067 --> 01:28:15,501
She has to give him
a fuckin' answer.

1605
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:18,395
You say he's hot for you
but he asked her.

1606
01:28:18,572 --> 01:28:21,063
It stops here, it's over, curtains.

1607
01:28:21,242 --> 01:28:23,267
Give up, girl, stop.

1608
01:28:23,444 --> 01:28:25,503
He doesn't love you no more!

1609
01:28:33,992 --> 01:28:35,391
He doesn't want you.

1610
01:28:38,263 --> 01:28:42,495
Know what? Give him an answer.
Tell him what you want.

1611
01:28:44,436 --> 01:28:46,370
I don't give a toss anymore.

1612
01:28:47,338 --> 01:28:49,533
He can drop dead for all I care.

1613
01:28:53,778 --> 01:28:55,109
Dumb bitch!

1614
01:28:58,253 --> 01:28:59,550
Goddamn slut.

1615
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:03,251
That girl gets my back up bad.

1616
01:29:05,227 --> 01:29:08,822
Leave her, she acts cool
but she's dead hot for him.

1617
01:29:09,064 --> 01:29:10,258
Sure...

1618
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,192
Forget her.

1619
01:29:14,036 --> 01:29:15,162
Screw that.

1620
01:29:42,902 --> 01:29:44,164
- Come on.
- Where to?

1621
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:45,099
Surprise.

1622
01:29:45,304 --> 01:29:47,935
- Where're we goin'?
- Surprise, okay.

1623
01:30:02,092 --> 01:30:04,788
- What is this shit?
- Don't worry.

1624
01:30:04,961 --> 01:30:06,792
What're they doin' here?

1625
01:30:06,963 --> 01:30:08,453
I told Lydia to be here.

1626
01:30:11,034 --> 01:30:13,233
To sort this thing out.

1627
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:14,965
What?

1628
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,837
- You did that?
- Chill.

1629
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,337
You fucker!

1630
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:21,438
- Chill, okay.
- Forget it!

1631
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,474
- You'll get your answer.
- So what?

1632
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:35,351
Fuck...

1633
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:37,224
Come here, please.

1634
01:30:37,968 --> 01:30:39,527
- What do I do?
- I dunno.

1635
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:42,806
- Don't drop me in this shit.
- We'll come too.

1636
01:31:00,358 --> 01:31:02,155
I don't know what to do.

1637
01:31:15,544 --> 01:31:17,171
Come on, move.

1638
01:31:20,682 --> 01:31:23,378
This whole thing's
startin' to piss me off.

1639
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:24,348
Me too.

1640
01:31:24,853 --> 01:31:28,418
Know what? We'll go see a homey
and have a drink.

1641
01:31:28,594 --> 01:31:31,461
Meanwhile,
you sort things out with him.

1642
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,463
Get in.

1643
01:31:36,435 --> 01:31:37,367
Okay, Krimo?

1644
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:44,406
Only Lydia, I said.

1645
01:31:47,146 --> 01:31:48,135
What?

1646
01:31:48,347 --> 01:31:49,609
Only Lydia.

1647
01:31:49,982 --> 01:31:51,176
Hold on, I'm Lydia.

1648
01:31:51,384 --> 01:31:52,351
That's her.

1649
01:31:52,552 --> 01:31:53,920
That's me.

1650
01:31:56,493 --> 01:31:59,519
- You could've said.
- Did I know?

1651
01:31:59,863 --> 01:32:00,955
- Get out.
- Okay.

1652
01:32:03,433 --> 01:32:04,866
Bustin' my balls...

1653
01:32:05,935 --> 01:32:08,130
Violence straight off, no style.

1654
01:32:08,972 --> 01:32:11,440
Get in, we need to talk.

1655
01:32:14,878 --> 01:32:16,243
Get in the car.

1656
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,124
We're gonna sort this out, okay.

1657
01:32:34,034 --> 01:32:35,092
Get out, please.

1658
01:32:37,304 --> 01:32:38,168
Get out!

1659
01:32:42,912 --> 01:32:44,973
Let them fuckin' talk!

1660
01:32:46,017 --> 01:32:49,077
- Let them discuss this.
- You get out too.

1661
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,554
Fuck, give 'em time to talk.

1662
01:32:52,156 --> 01:32:54,454
You're here, so we're here too.

1663
01:32:55,059 --> 01:32:56,458
Give us a break.

1664
01:32:57,462 --> 01:32:58,827
Will you get out?

1665
01:32:59,997 --> 01:33:00,929
You won't?

1666
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,447
Go on.

1667
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:17,384
Okay, I'm gettin' out.

1668
01:33:18,153 --> 01:33:19,916
What's this girl shit?

1669
01:33:20,956 --> 01:33:23,356
Let these people talk together.

1670
01:33:23,525 --> 01:33:24,787
Loser!

1671
01:33:25,327 --> 01:33:26,225
What's up?

1672
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:28,586
They're gettin' out, so am I.

1673
01:33:28,964 --> 01:33:30,056
Leave me be.

1674
01:33:30,265 --> 01:33:32,290
Hands off! What're you doin'?

1675
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:35,167
They're gettin' out,
so let me out too.

1676
01:33:35,341 --> 01:33:37,070
You stay in the car, okay?

1677
01:33:38,177 --> 01:33:40,008
Get in, sort this thing out.

1678
01:33:40,212 --> 01:33:42,146
- Gently, asshole!
- Let her go!

1679
01:33:42,381 --> 01:33:43,905
Let me out!

1680
01:33:44,216 --> 01:33:45,877
You're hurtin' me.

1681
01:33:46,852 --> 01:33:48,979
Let 'em talk for fuck's sake!

1682
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,321
You won't let other people talk?
You're fuckin' kids!

1683
01:33:54,493 --> 01:33:58,558
You're the kid, Mr. Violence.
You're crazy. Jus' who are you?

1684
01:33:58,902 --> 01:34:00,335
Get back in the car.

1685
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:03,472
Stop bustin' their balls.
Leave 'em be, brother.

1686
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,201
I thought you wanted an answer.

1687
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:12,974
I'm not gettin' in alone.

1688
01:34:25,499 --> 01:34:29,026
Know what? You two get in
and we'll wait over there.

1689
01:34:29,369 --> 01:34:30,802
I'm not goin' with you.

1690
01:34:31,538 --> 01:34:32,800
C'mon, it's okay.

1691
01:34:33,006 --> 01:34:34,405
I'm stayin' with Lydia.

1692
01:34:34,575 --> 01:34:36,304
Cut it out!

1693
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:44,009
C'mon, move.

1694
01:35:24,232 --> 01:35:26,325
What's this hassle you're givin' me?

1695
01:35:26,501 --> 01:35:28,469
I swear, I didn't know.

1696
01:36:11,187 --> 01:36:12,484
Here you go.

1697
01:36:32,346 --> 01:36:34,610
- What'll she say?
- My guess is yes.

1698
01:36:34,948 --> 01:36:37,439
She'd have said that ages ago.
I say no.

1699
01:36:37,618 --> 01:36:38,607
No, I know her.

1700
01:36:38,952 --> 01:36:40,351
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1701
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,250
You can't wait
to hear the answer too.

1702
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,448
- I don't give a toss.
- So why're you here?

1703
01:36:45,626 --> 01:36:48,151
- For my homey.
- Drop dead!

1704
01:36:58,943 --> 01:37:00,342
Have you done thinkin'?

1705
01:37:06,617 --> 01:37:07,606
Say somethin'...

1706
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:12,281
You think I can think?
I can't think!

1707
01:37:12,657 --> 01:37:13,885
Look at all this!

1708
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:17,254
Can I get my head straight?
Everyone's hasslin' me!

1709
01:37:17,529 --> 01:37:21,195
I've been gettin' this non-stop
since you asked.

1710
01:37:21,403 --> 01:37:25,305
Everyone's pissin' me off,
tryin' to get me to give an answer.

1711
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:27,100
Do I get time to think?

1712
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:30,171
I can't,
I'm under all this pressure!

1713
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:38,147
Magali keeps pissin' me off.
She's always goin' on,

1714
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,049
makin' out
I'm some kinda slut!

1715
01:37:41,256 --> 01:37:45,321
They all step up the pressure.
My homey says I'm not straight!

1716
01:37:45,497 --> 01:37:49,024
Know what I hear every day?
"Be straight. Answer him."

1717
01:37:49,234 --> 01:37:50,929
I'm fuckin' sick of it!

1718
01:37:52,237 --> 01:37:55,104
It's too much pressure.
I can't take it.

1719
01:38:03,148 --> 01:38:06,276
It's not over for her.
It's not over.

1720
01:38:06,685 --> 01:38:11,183
It's easy to say Magali's over
but she comes pissin' me off.

1721
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,922
Until it's over, she'll keep on
causin' me hassle and all.

1722
01:38:16,132 --> 01:38:19,465
Do they piss you off?
They make me out to be a slut!

1723
01:38:19,635 --> 01:38:21,660
They say I came on to you.

1724
01:38:22,004 --> 01:38:25,201
She says my stage dress's neckline
is too low!

1725
01:38:25,374 --> 01:38:26,966
That you're actin' for me.

1726
01:38:34,955 --> 01:38:37,321
- She took his hand.
- No shit?

1727
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,561
I need time to think, see.

1728
01:38:49,202 --> 01:38:51,170
I can't think like this.

1729
01:38:52,939 --> 01:38:53,928
It's no use?

1730
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:56,132
Is it?

1731
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:58,645
You must know if...

1732
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,142
You must...

1733
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,909
Please...

1734
01:39:17,668 --> 01:39:19,568
Fuck, the pigs.

1735
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:28,974
Stay calm, okay.

1736
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:41,085
I smell smoke.

1737
01:39:41,596 --> 01:39:43,496
The registration, please.

1738
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:46,990
- The registration.
- We don't have it.

1739
01:39:49,274 --> 01:39:50,468
Get out!

1740
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,580
Let's see your hands.
Raise your arms.

1741
01:40:00,085 --> 01:40:02,986
- It's not our car.
- See my colleague.

1742
01:40:04,223 --> 01:40:05,986
- Whose is it?
- Nobody's.

1743
01:40:06,158 --> 01:40:08,888
- Who asked you?
- I'm just explainin'.

1744
01:40:09,061 --> 01:40:10,995
- No dangerous items?
- It's not ours.

1745
01:40:11,163 --> 01:40:12,152
Your pockets.

1746
01:40:12,364 --> 01:40:14,529
- What were you doing?
- Talkin'.

1747
01:40:15,471 --> 01:40:16,495
You don't know?

1748
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:23,069
- Your pockets...
- Can I explain?

1749
01:40:24,313 --> 01:40:27,407
- Is it stolen?
- No, we found it here.

1750
01:40:30,519 --> 01:40:32,043
Empty your pockets.

1751
01:40:32,488 --> 01:40:34,456
Come on, make it snappy.

1752
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:40,155
We were all together, like...

1753
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:42,028
and we were...

1754
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:47,099
We were together, out walkin',
and we came by here...

1755
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:50,909
We were hangin' out, like,

1756
01:40:51,077 --> 01:40:53,910
and at one point... we got here.

1757
01:40:54,714 --> 01:40:57,012
And since they wanted to talk...

1758
01:40:57,183 --> 01:40:59,117
- Who?
- Lydia.

1759
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:00,286
Hands on the hood.

1760
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,521
Talk about what?

1761
01:41:03,026 --> 01:41:04,221
A deal?

1762
01:41:04,428 --> 01:41:06,555
- Who?
- The blonde in the car.

1763
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:08,224
Get her out.

1764
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:10,258
Come here, you.

1765
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:12,025
They wanted to talk.

1766
01:41:13,971 --> 01:41:15,199
What's her name?

1767
01:41:17,308 --> 01:41:19,139
She wanted to talk to him.

1768
01:41:19,576 --> 01:41:21,134
No dangerous items?

1769
01:41:21,478 --> 01:41:23,036
What about?

1770
01:41:24,114 --> 01:41:25,274
Somethin' private.

1771
01:41:27,117 --> 01:41:28,918
Empty your pockets out.

1772
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:30,687
Romantic shit.

1773
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,591
Somethin' personal.

1774
01:41:34,028 --> 01:41:35,427
Is this yours?

1775
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:38,292
Is that it?

1776
01:41:40,168 --> 01:41:41,328
You just found it?

1777
01:41:41,536 --> 01:41:42,969
That's right.

1778
01:41:43,171 --> 01:41:44,536
That's it, ma'am.

1779
01:41:45,506 --> 01:41:47,235
All right.

1780
01:41:50,645 --> 01:41:51,373
I'm clean.

1781
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:53,072
Just checking.

1782
01:41:54,686 --> 01:41:55,948
This isn't yours.

1783
01:41:58,023 --> 01:41:59,388
I dunno. It's not mine.

1784
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,428
You're sure? Know what it is?

1785
01:42:04,396 --> 01:42:05,954
Hands on the hood.

1786
01:42:06,465 --> 01:42:08,126
I said it's not our car.

1787
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:13,338
- Can I go on, sir?
- I'm listening.

1788
01:42:13,538 --> 01:42:15,233
- What then?
- Hurry it up!

1789
01:42:15,407 --> 01:42:18,208
We came down the street.
The car was unlocked.

1790
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:22,147
I told them to get inside to talk
to get outta the cold.

1791
01:42:23,552 --> 01:42:25,076
That's everything?

1792
01:42:25,254 --> 01:42:27,984
I doubt it.
I knew it. What's this?

1793
01:42:28,557 --> 01:42:31,185
When I say empty them,
you empty them!

1794
01:42:31,594 --> 01:42:33,118
What's this here?

1795
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:36,930
What is it?
What're you hiding in there?

1796
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:41,526
What is it?
I said empty your pockets, okay!

1797
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:45,003
D'you understand what I say?
Answer me!

1798
01:42:50,683 --> 01:42:52,947
Hands on the hood!

1799
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,677
Sir, we're not hoodlums.

1800
01:42:55,021 --> 01:42:56,249
Shut your mouth.

1801
01:42:59,559 --> 01:43:00,651
Hands on the hood.

1802
01:43:01,027 --> 01:43:02,426
Got anything left?

1803
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:10,267
Don't move, you!

1804
01:43:11,608 --> 01:43:13,269
Keep your hands there.

1805
01:43:14,445 --> 01:43:15,707
Don't move!

1806
01:43:20,284 --> 01:43:21,376
Let go of me!

1807
01:43:21,552 --> 01:43:23,349
You're giving me orders?

1808
01:43:24,088 --> 01:43:25,282
Fuckin' calm down.

1809
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,921
Watch your mouth, you.

1810
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:30,320
Telling us what to do, fucker?

1811
01:43:34,168 --> 01:43:37,399
What is it now? Go on, talk.
It hurts, huh?

1812
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,503
What're you going to do now, huh?

1813
01:43:41,075 --> 01:43:42,133
What'll you do?

1814
01:43:42,543 --> 01:43:44,602
Shut it, okay!

1815
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:47,238
No one asked you, so shut it!

1816
01:43:47,748 --> 01:43:51,343
Shut your mouth, okay,
just keep it shut, you hear?

1817
01:43:53,387 --> 01:43:56,220
Your hands behind your back, I said!

1818
01:43:57,258 --> 01:43:58,661
Fucker!

1819
01:43:59,231 --> 01:44:00,926
Fucker? Gimme your hands!

1820
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:03,596
We'll see who's the fucker now.

1821
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:10,164
- What's that? Who's the fucker?
- You are.

1822
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,440
You really want a beating?
You'll get it!

1823
01:44:19,017 --> 01:44:20,143
That hurts!

1824
01:44:20,352 --> 01:44:21,944
I don't give a shit!

1825
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:27,629
- Want another?
- Shut your mouth!

1826
01:44:29,965 --> 01:44:32,365
Okay, tell me,
who's the fucker now?

1827
01:44:32,535 --> 01:44:34,901
You are, you little shit.

1828
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:36,503
Let go of me!

1829
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:39,234
- Let go of me, okay!
- It's okay.

1830
01:44:43,546 --> 01:44:45,104
Let go of me!

1831
01:44:47,116 --> 01:44:48,485
This one's wild.

1832
01:44:54,994 --> 01:44:58,725
All right, let's see those birds
beat their wings.

1833
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:38,537
One day, all the birds in the world

1834
01:45:38,713 --> 01:45:41,409
came together
for a big conference.

1835
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:45,018
Ray of Hope took the floor.

1836
01:45:45,553 --> 01:45:48,818
Dear birds, you do nothing
but quarrel and fight.

1837
01:45:49,023 --> 01:45:52,857
This cannot go on.
Listen to me, we have a king.

1838
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:56,986
A king?
We've had many kings before.

1839
01:45:57,331 --> 01:45:58,958
Why do we need another?

1840
01:45:59,567 --> 01:46:02,400
Just a second.
The one I'm talking about

1841
01:46:02,604 --> 01:46:03,869
is the true king.

1842
01:46:04,075 --> 01:46:06,703
His name is Simorgue.

1843
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:09,307
Let us seek him out.

1844
01:46:09,714 --> 01:46:11,443
Let us seek him out!

1845
01:46:56,102 --> 01:46:57,000
Hey, girls...

1846
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:58,359
Is it packed?

1847
01:46:58,571 --> 01:47:00,937
Quiet, my little brother's on.

1848
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,508
Wicked.

1849
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,071
Guess who I jus' saw, the bitch.

1850
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:07,674
- Incredible.
- Who?

1851
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,108
- It's crazy.
- Tell us.

1852
01:47:09,449 --> 01:47:12,043
Magali in Omar's arms,
isn't that crazy shit?

1853
01:47:12,418 --> 01:47:14,648
- Magali?
- Yeah, at the back on the left.

1854
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,584
- Sittin' there, kissin'.
- Which Omar?

1855
01:47:17,759 --> 01:47:19,558
Halima's brother, straight up.

1856
01:47:19,763 --> 01:47:22,357
- Cut it out!
- On my mother's life.

1857
01:47:22,532 --> 01:47:24,830
- That's crazy!
- On my grandmother's grave.

1858
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:27,060
- No shit!
- She's in his arms.

1859
01:47:27,437 --> 01:47:28,495
They're watchin'.

1860
01:47:28,705 --> 01:47:30,673
C'mon, you're imaginin' it.

1861
01:47:30,874 --> 01:47:31,898
On the Koran!

1862
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:34,407
She's still hot for Krimo...

1863
01:47:34,578 --> 01:47:37,012
It's true! You think I'm crazy?

1864
01:47:37,514 --> 01:47:38,811
See for yourselves.

1865
01:47:39,015 --> 01:47:41,779
- Let's see.
- Quiet, my little brother's on.

1866
01:47:42,553 --> 01:47:44,046
At the back on the left.

1867
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:52,857
Quietly...

1868
01:47:54,502 --> 01:47:56,470
Let's return to our search.

1869
01:47:57,371 --> 01:48:00,363
The patient must be very patient.

1870
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:03,700
- What do you seek?
- I seek my path.

1871
01:48:03,911 --> 01:48:06,880
I'm seeking everywhere
to find it one day.

1872
01:48:16,094 --> 01:48:17,755
Gently...

1873
01:48:18,663 --> 01:48:20,324
Gently with the wings.

1874
01:48:26,471 --> 01:48:30,407
Show us the path
for we have crossed the 7 valleys.

1875
01:48:30,608 --> 01:48:32,908
You have crossed nothing.

1876
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:37,516
Those valleys were a dream.
We are still in the same place.

1877
01:48:37,686 --> 01:48:39,677
The birds lowered their heads.

1878
01:48:39,855 --> 01:48:43,723
Some died,
just a few reached their goal.

1879
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:51,627
Abdelkrim!

1880
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:56,530
We've made a long journey
just to reach ourselves.

1881
01:49:45,896 --> 01:49:47,957
I hope my voice won't shake.

1882
01:50:02,516 --> 01:50:06,316
Why take it upon yourself
to answer for my feelings?

1883
01:50:06,487 --> 01:50:08,682
I believed

1884
01:50:08,856 --> 01:50:11,916
your feelings were like
any other woman's.

1885
01:50:13,163 --> 01:50:16,361
Your father asks
if you are pleased to be married,

1886
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:18,068
if it brings you joy.

1887
01:50:18,436 --> 01:50:21,462
I told him that yes,
it was obvious.

1888
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:23,937
You must be the only woman alive

1889
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,776
for whom "yes" is not true.
Refusal is not natural.

1890
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:30,881
Refusal is not natural?
How naively silly!

1891
01:50:31,049 --> 01:50:33,711
Marriage holds
a certain charm for you.

1892
01:50:33,918 --> 01:50:36,944
There too, I answer, "Yes".

1893
01:50:37,388 --> 01:50:40,054
Be silent!
Take your impertinence elsewhere.

1894
01:50:40,395 --> 01:50:43,853
It is not for you
to judge my heart with yours.

1895
01:50:44,433 --> 01:50:46,526
My heart is made like any other.

1896
01:50:46,702 --> 01:50:49,603
If it were to dare,
it would call me original.

1897
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:11,088
Tell me, who are you
to speak like this?

1898
01:51:11,464 --> 01:51:13,796
The son of a poor soldier.

1899
01:51:14,066 --> 01:51:17,934
I heartily wish you
a better situation than this one

1900
01:51:18,137 --> 01:51:21,800
and would like to help you.
Fate has mistreated you.

1901
01:51:21,974 --> 01:51:24,499
In truth, love has done more harm.

1902
01:51:24,944 --> 01:51:27,607
I would prefer
being granted your heart

1903
01:51:27,815 --> 01:51:29,512
to all the world's riches.

1904
01:51:44,467 --> 01:51:47,561
Is it mistreated, abandoned so?

1905
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:49,170
For now, simply give it

1906
01:51:49,539 --> 01:51:52,406
your dainty hand
to amuse it a little.

1907
01:51:55,816 --> 01:51:57,716
Here, you little pest,

1908
01:51:57,885 --> 01:52:01,343
perhaps I'll find peace now.

1909
01:52:05,392 --> 01:52:06,757
Plaything of my soul...

1910
01:52:14,635 --> 01:52:18,405
This is as sweet as a fine wine.
How sad

1911
01:52:18,609 --> 01:52:19,906
I only have the dregs.

1912
01:52:20,945 --> 01:52:22,071
Come, come!

1913
01:52:22,413 --> 01:52:23,380
Stop that!

1914
01:52:23,881 --> 01:52:24,905
You're too skilled.

1915
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:28,575
I wish merely to get by
while waiting to live.

1916
01:52:29,187 --> 01:52:30,848
Should we not show reason?

1917
01:52:31,022 --> 01:52:32,956
Reason? I have none!

1918
01:52:33,124 --> 01:52:35,888
Your crafty eyes
stole it away from me.

1919
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,960
Can you possibly love me so?

1920
01:52:39,197 --> 01:52:40,960
I find it hard to believe.

1921
01:52:42,033 --> 01:52:44,699
I do not care if it's possible.

1922
01:52:44,906 --> 01:52:46,897
I love you like a lost soul.

1923
01:52:47,109 --> 01:52:48,872
Your mirror shows it.

1924
01:52:49,044 --> 01:52:51,410
My mirror heightens my disbelief.

1925
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:52,911
Oh, sweet beauty.

1926
01:52:53,081 --> 01:52:54,742
Is your humility

1927
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:56,645
a mere hypocrite?

1928
01:53:43,506 --> 01:53:45,565
Your dowry outweighed you once.

1929
01:53:45,775 --> 01:53:47,675
Now you put it to shame.

1930
01:53:47,977 --> 01:53:49,945
Come now, jump, marquis!

1931
