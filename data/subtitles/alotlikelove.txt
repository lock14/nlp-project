00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:13,077

you assume that I'm paying.

I mean, at least make a move.

179

It's not gonna take 20 years.
It's gonna take five years.

- No!

a car - a nice car - and a future,

Oh, I think you're gonna have
a big problem.

What are you doing?

194
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,288
All right. I am writing down
my parents' phone number.

- You live with your parents?
- No.

196

Yes.
But not in six years, I won't.

197
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,031
What does six years have anything
to do with it?

198
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:45,844
Yeah, well, if you let me finish,
it's my whole... it's my whole point.

You ask 'em how to reach me.

202

Then you call my house, and when
my beautiful wife answers the phone,

203
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,412
then you can ask her
where to send the 20 bucks you owe me.

204

20 bucks? I thought you were gonna
be some hotshot business guy.

205

Fine. 50.

206
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:12,198

338
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,707
<i>OK. God. I didn"t knoW.
Sorry.</i>

339
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:21,446
<i>What a goofball, huh?
(clears throat) You still there?</i>

340
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,023
Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

341
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,823
So what's up?

342
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,388
No, I was just...
I was just wondering...

343
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:31,200
I just came across
your number all of a sudden

344
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,244
<i>and I was just thinking to myself...
(clears throat)</i>

345
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:36,613
You know, "Wow, I wonder what
Oliver's doing."

346
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:39,617
You know, I know that you're
probably busy tonight,

347
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,685
but I was just wondering if you
wanted to grab a coffee this afternoon.

348
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,770
- Sure.
- So, really?

349
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:49,670
<i>- (Ellen) Oliver.
- I'm on the phone, Ellen.</i>

350
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,007
I know. When you gettin' off?
I'm expecting a call.

351
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,079
You got a pager, Ellen.

352
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:55,743
<i>- I know. but I can't talk on a pager.
- Ellen, get off the phone!</i>

353
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:58,186
You are such a dick!

354
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:01,387
Get off the phone, Ellen!
Mom, tell Ellen to get off the phone.

355
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,094
- Ellen!
- Hello?

356
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,265
<i>Sorry about that.
(chuckles) You still there?</i>

357
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,640
Yeah.

358
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:13,376
Uh, where are you?
I'll come over.

359
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,055
- Now?
- Yes.

360
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:18,720
Why don't I...
Why don't I come over?

361
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,111
<i>(door buzzer)</i>

362
00:28:32,955 --> 00:28:34,822
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. It"s me.</i>

363
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:40,060
Hey. The gate's broken,
so just give it a jiggle and then just push.

364
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,316
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:58,067
- I'm Emily.
- I'm Oliver.

366
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,731
You're not Oliver.

367
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,808
Ahh!

368
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:07,176
That's it? I thought you'd
at least invite him in.

369
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:09,016
You owe me ten dollars.

370
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:11,251
I knew he wasn't you.
You're not that good-looking.

371
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,395
- She didn't say that.
- Wait, what did he say?

372
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:20,807
What did he tell you I said?
I said you were good-looking.

373
00:29:20,877 --> 00:29:22,711
- Told you.
- That's what I said.

374
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:24,443
You...

375
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:32,990
- He's a little...
- He's saying you're crazy.

376
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:35,001
Yeah, I got that.

377
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,040
<i>(car horn honks)</i>

378
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,471
Did she honk?

379
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,778
Why?

380
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:45,378
My wife. I'm going.

381
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:48,122
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

382
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,378
- Hi.
- Hi.

383
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,486
- You look different.
- So do you.

384
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:04,525
- But, like, good different.
- You, too. I like your hair.

385
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:06,221
Thank you.

386
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:09,526
I'm still signing.

387
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:13,300
Why? I don't know.
I'm stopping. OK.

388
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,314
Your brother screen all your dates?

389
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,982
This is a date?

390
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:43,154
Can I get you anything to drink?
A tea or a soda?

391
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:46,702
- I'm good, thanks.
- Just gonna grab a beer.

392
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:58,519
I can't believe you just assumed
that this was what this was about.

393
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:06,770
You can't... You can't believe I assumed
that what was about the what?

394
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:09,311
Because I'm not the same girl
you met three years ago.

395
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:14,183
I mean, I'm the same girl,
but it's not at all the same situation.

396
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,779
Right.
I understand.

397
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:17,952
I'm not one of those girls
who needs to sleep with someone

398
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:22,059
after every stupid breakup
just to prove she's still got it. I...

399
00:31:22,135 --> 00:31:24,403
Yeah.

400
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:26,468
What are you doing?

401
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,078
I am looking for your crazy pills.

402
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:35,089
You know, they have to be around here
somewhere for moments like these, right?

403
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,393
That's not funny.

404
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,800
What if I really was crazy?

405
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:44,000
Have you eaten today?

406
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,675
How can you live in LA
and not have a car?

407
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:53,785
I had a car, then I sold it.
I needed the capital for my business.

408
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,697
That's right.
The plan. The ducks.

409
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,460
It's all coming back to me now.

410
00:31:58,538 --> 00:32:02,203
Only two and a half more years
until you're rich.

411
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:03,211
That's right.

412
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,047
Is your beautiful wife gonna live in your
parents' basement with you?

413
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:09,715
- I don't live with my parents.
- Just visiting?

414
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,596
No, I was just pickin'
some stuff up 'cause I'm moving.

415
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,601
"Diaper-rush-dot-com"?

416
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,507
That's what it says.
We sell diapers on the Internet.

417
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,047
I thought the whole
Internet thing was done already.

418
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:25,884
- Just need a good business plan.
- Diapers?

419
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,952
So, how's Bon Jovi?
Does he still rock?

420
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,194
Who?

421
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,763
Oh, him. He switched bands
and moved to Seattle.

422
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:40,806
Nice. Hope he knows how to steam milk
and make those little chocolate shavings.

423
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,979
Big talk coming from a diaper salesman.

424
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,683
Oh, OK.

425
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,661
And the latest breakup?
What's he do?

426
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,031
- Is he a baseball player or a cosmonaut?
- Who said I had a breakup?

427
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:55,542
You did. In your kitchen
during your hypoglycemic rant.

428
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:59,373
So?
Spill it. Who's the guy?

429
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:02,217
I'm not telling you.

430
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:06,595
Did you dump him?
No. He dumped you.

431
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:09,260
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
- OK.

432
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:11,738
Fine.
Then I'm not talkin' at all.

433
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,073
- You're not talking?
- You ain't gettin' boo outta me.

434
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:16,548
Fine, I'm not talking either.

435
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,199
<i>(coughs. Chokes)</i>

436
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:59,974
<i>(gasps)</i>

437
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,936
Are you OK?

438
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:49,625
OK, fine.
I'll tell you.

439
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:53,434
Mmm. My brother's deaf, Em.

440
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,945
I can go days without talking.

441
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:59,351
Can we have the check, please?

442
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,362
- I met him in class.
- Yeah?

443
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:10,463
- You went back to school?
- Acting class.

444
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,976
<i>- Ah, he's an actor.
- (chuckles)</i>

445
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,050
Wow, actors. That's like
one rung up from musicians.

446
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,710
He was a writer.
Is a writer.

447
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,260
Hm.
Hi. Could I get a coffee?

448
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,159
- Mm-hm.
- Just very black.

449
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,789
- After you.
- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

450
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:28,168
- Frappuccino, please.
- All right.

451
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:33,141
I believe the question
was who dumped whom?

452
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,246
He left me.

453
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,923
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

454
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,730
No. But I appreciate the reach.

455
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,364
The acting classes are really
paying off, but I got it.

456
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,670
Shut up, I got it.

457
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,521
So what are your plans?

458
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,353
- Plans for what?
- Tonight.

459
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,197
It is New Year's.

460
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:05,072
Yeah.
I'm not a really big New Year's guy.

461
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:09,605
<i>- Bunch of amateurs getting drunk.
- (Whispers) Yeah. Yeah.</i>

462
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:13,987
- Cringy people wearing those party hats.
- Ah! The hats.

463
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,192
Lame.

464
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,137
- I know of a party.
- Really?

465
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:22,538
Let's go.

466
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:32,885
You got more clothes in your trunk
than I got in my whole closet.

467
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,519
Try this.

468
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:37,362
Nice.
Is this Bon Jovi's?

469
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:41,773
Am I supposed to act like I'm some big
Hollywood-producer type or something?

470
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,905
Just be yourself.

471
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:47,347
Except maybe don't mention
the whole diaper thing.

472
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:51,987
Hey, Emily.
I gotta ask you somethin'.

473
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:55,000
- Hey, do you mind?
- Sorry.

474
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:57,367
What?
What do you have to ask me?

475
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,039
- Well, what was strike one?
- What?

476
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,481
In New York.

477
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,215
Strike two was that
I didn't play guitar.

478
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:11,163
Strike three was that I was born
under the wrong star sign.

479
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,668
What was strike one?

480
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:18,608
Strike one was that
I had to make the first move.

481
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,451
I got strike one before we even met?

482
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:26,858
You can't get strike one
before you step up to the plate.

483
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:35,239
You drive.

484
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:41,108
- I introduced myself.
- What?

485
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:44,717
In New York. I introduced myself.
That's not a move?

486
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:48,460
- Who called who today?
- I didn't have your number.

487
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,335
You never asked.

488
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:54,139
<i>(gasps) You came!</i>

489
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:56,773
And with a young man in tow.

490
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,719
This is Michelle
and Michelle's fiancé, Michael.

491
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:02,291
Hi. Oliver.

492
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:04,762
<i>(clears throat) I sell diapers.</i>

493
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,902
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

494
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,306
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, my God! Look at you.

495
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:21,125
- Get you a drink?
- I'm good, thanks.

496
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,956
I think I'll get one.

497
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,141
Uh-uh. You are not
getting off that easy.

498
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:32,807
He's an old friend.

499
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,855
<i>I wish I had an old friend that looked
like that. (Whispering) He's gorgeous.</i>

500
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:38,052
Come on, give it up.

501
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,039
Uh-oh.

502
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:51,313
Very carefully, I want you to move
backwards in the direction of the bar.

503
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,561
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

504
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,170
Hello?

505
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,731
Ellen, it's me.

506
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,641
What do you want, Oliver?

507
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,844
Listen, I'm at this big Hollywood party

508
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:13,483
<i>and I just ran into that...
the White rapper guy you like.</i>

509
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:16,155
Eminem?
No way!

510
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:19,498
So listen. So I'm sitting at the bar,
right? And we're talking.

511
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,376
And outta nowhere he starts
running his hand up and down my leg.

512
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,512
Happy New Year, Ellen.

513
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:30,682
You're such a dick, Oliver!

514
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,592
- Thank you.
- Eminem's here?

515
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,710
Who's he talking to?
Her?

516
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:44,648
Some guy.

517
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:47,916
- Now he's talking to her.
- She just kissed him.

518
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,289
- Kissed who?
- Peter. She's kissing Peter.

519
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:52,456
Is he kissing her back?

520
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:11,697
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
It sounded like you said you sell diapers.

521
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:13,635
There you are!

522
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,536

I told you.

You did?

It's official.
The power's off.

556
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,469
When did you tell me?

557
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:34,608
Earlier.

558

Don't bother, I already picked it up.

Why'd you ask me
if I got it in the first place?

594
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:55,702
Because I knew you wouldn't
remember that I asked you.

595
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:58,509
I knew you'd forget it.

596

You know what, Oliver?
You're never here.

my work there, so...

670

That's really cool.
How'd you do that?

671
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,699
You leave the shutter open.
The hard part's staying still,

672
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:53,472
otherwise you're just a blur

00:55:55,114 --> 00:55:58,246
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face.

674
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:01,157
So make yourself at home.

675
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:09,134
Wait, he just landed on your doorstep?
Honey, that's perfect.

676
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:12,010
Don't get excited,
he lives 400 miles away.

<i>Emily. Let's not get picky.</i>

678
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,983
And I couldn't look less sexy.

<i>Oh. Stop it. You"re gorgeous.</i>

680
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,958
- Has he put the moves on you yet?
- He's not the type.

<i>(sing-song) Someone's gonna have sex.</i>

I gotta go. Wish me luck.

<i>You don"t need it.
Call me.</i>

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

685
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,197
I mean, she owned a business, right?

686
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:46,539
Like, selling antiques. And she used to
work for the mayor's office as an advisor.

687
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,547
- But she said she didn't like it. So...
- Wow, two careers already.

688
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:53,420
Yeah. So I thought that
she would understand,

689
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,452
you know, the kinda work that you gotta
put in when you're first startin' out.

690
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:58,931
But...

691
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:06,844
She said that she couldn't be
number three or number four

692
00:57:06,914 --> 00:57:09,715
on someone's list of priorities.

693
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:14,422
She said she could be number two,
but not if number one was selling diapers.

I'm pro pancakes.

I can't decide what to get.

711

How are you?

716
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,793
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good. It's been such a long time.

00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:48,201
Really long, yeah.

718
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,434
- I've been meaning to call you.
- Me too.

719
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:53,844
I was hoping that we could actually
get together and talk a bit.

720
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:57,911
- Yeah, that would be great.
- It'd be good.

Oh. Great.

727
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,807
I was gonna sneak on by,
but then I thought,

728
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:17,585
"I saw you,
so you probably saw me and..."

729
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:21,463
Yeah, no, it's good that you
both said hi.

730

Even at home.
Well, Bridget's home.

753
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,943
See, I moved in with her.

754
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:59,641
That was my big mistake right there.

755
01:00:59,715 --> 01:01:03,177
I shoulda stuck with the plan.
I mean, the plan was working.

756
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:07,559
You know, the irony of it
is that Bridget actually loves plans.

757
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,065
We used to go on these trips.

758
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:14,507
She would plan everything
down to, like, the very last detail.

759
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:18,777
I mean, like, including the gas station
that we were gonna stop at.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh, baby,
please don't go

763

We were at this B&B station, right?

- If you leave me now
- And it starts raining, right?

765
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:38,144
- You'll take away the very heart of me
- And I'm not talkin' about regular rain.

766
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:40,987
It was like torrential-downpour rain.

Ooh-ooh-ooh, no, baby, please don't go

768
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,500
So Bridget comes up
with this great idea, right?

769
01:01:49,608 --> 01:01:53,514
- Just want you to stay
- Park the car in the car wash.

770
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:57,023
Because who's gonna wash
their car when it's raining?

771
01:01:57,123 --> 01:02:02,360

OK, now I don't know.
Sounds stupid when I say it out loud.

Honestly, if you're not willing to sound
stupid, you don't deserve to be in love.

out here for a second?

841
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:21,755
<i>Love burns brighter than sunshine</i>

842
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:25,195
Folks.

843
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:29,873
<i>Let the rain fall
I don't care</i>

844
01:07:29,943 --> 01:07:35,385
<i>I'm yours and suddenly you're mine</i>

845
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:39,791
<i>Suddenly you're mine</i>

846
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:45,594
<i>And it's brighter than sunshine</i>

847
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:48,164
Folks, this is a national park.

848
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:52,641
Why don't you get back in your clothes,
back in your car

849
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:55,849
and back on the highway.

850
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,257
Have a nice day.

851
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,807
I gotta go.

852
01:08:09,884 --> 01:08:10,976
OK.

853
01:08:23,073 --> 01:08:28,416
So anyway,
we got this big VC meeting in New York.

854
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:31,984
Gotta put on this big
dog and pony show.

855
01:08:33,094 --> 01:08:36,360
- You know what VC is, right?
- No.

856
01:08:36,432 --> 01:08:42,309
It's venture capital.
It's like a big influx of cash,

857
01:08:42,377 --> 01:08:45,247
to really help us grow our business.

858
01:08:45,315 --> 01:08:47,877
It sounds exciting.

859
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:10,923
- I'll grab this.
- I got it, I got it.

860
01:09:18,878 --> 01:09:20,279
Well...

861
01:09:23,153 --> 01:09:26,023
You got my number.

862
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:28,323
And you've got mine.

863
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:30,457
Yes, I do.

864
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:36,234
So I'll let you know how things go...
in New York.

865
01:09:36,345 --> 01:09:38,712
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good.

866
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,923
I've still got some...

867
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:49,733
some, like, feelings to sort through.

868
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:53,206
- About...
- Bridget?

869
01:09:53,275 --> 01:09:54,836
Yeah.

870
01:09:54,912 --> 01:09:57,850
I didn't forget.
It's "Bridget."

871
01:09:57,917 --> 01:10:00,947
- I... It's...
- It's OK.

872
01:10:02,626 --> 01:10:05,189
- Is it?
- Yeah.

873
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:09,194
I met someone.

874
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,774
You met someone?

875
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:15,510
Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're
getting married or anything, but...

876
01:10:15,618 --> 01:10:17,952
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

877
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,384
This... this is someone different?
Not the writer guy?

878
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:24,399
Yeah, no, a different guy.
A new guy.

879
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:26,494
A different guy?

880
01:10:27,206 --> 01:10:29,198
What?

881
01:10:31,546 --> 01:10:35,213
I don't...
You know, it's...

882
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:40,960
Thank you.

883
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,134
So...

884
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:00,865
Don't.

885
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:02,962
You'll ruin it.

886
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:18,100
Get outta here, I'm sick of you.

887
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:35,155
Pitch and go.
Pitch and go, keep up the pace.

888
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:36,997
It's not a big deal.
I'm sorry.

889
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:40,634
It actually is quite a big deal.
But don't go too fast.

890
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,679
Ollie, you get really jittery
when you go too fast.

891
01:11:42,746 --> 01:11:45,411
And I need to make sure that you don't
speed through the whole thing

892
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:47,886
in such a way that nobody understands
exactly what you're saying.

893
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:49,585
Because we invested a lot of time,
and everything that we're that we're do...

894
01:11:49,658 --> 01:11:52,153
Jeet-o, I need you to shut up.
All right?

895
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:56,466
- This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.
- You're driving me crazy.

896
01:11:57,507 --> 01:11:58,975
<i>So... (clears throat)</i>

897
01:11:59,077 --> 01:12:02,948
...the baby...

898
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,144
The...

899
01:12:06,725 --> 01:12:07,886
<i>(mouths) Client.</i>

900
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,899
The client inputs the child's data

901
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:14,837
and the baby actually tracks its growth.

902
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:19,313
So when it's time
to move up to a bigger size...

903
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:25,087
There it is.
Bam. Just on your doorstep.

904
01:12:25,193 --> 01:12:27,128
No hassle, no fuss.

905
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:32,337
Does the baby have a name?

906
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,472
Does the baby have a name?
Yes.

907
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,015
What were we saying
for the baby's name?

908
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,150
Freddy.

909
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:46,130
Freddy.

910
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:51,167
- Doesn't have to be Fred.
- Gabe...

911
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,369
was another choice that we came up with.

912
01:12:54,747 --> 01:12:57,342
Gabe the babe.

913
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:04,630
My point is, is that there are
10,000 babies born every hour.

914
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:08,899
That's 254,000 babies a day.

915
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:13,505
And somebody's gotta figure out
where to put all that shit.

916
01:13:14,518 --> 01:13:16,453
I wanna be that guy.

917
01:13:19,226 --> 01:13:25,226
10,000 babies an hour.
Wouldn't that be 240,000 babies a day?

918
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:34,311
Yes.

919
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:43,101
It was good, Ollie.
You were great.

920
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:46,337
I mean, there was that one little thing,
but I don't think it was a big deal.

921
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:47,377
How about you?
You think it was good?

922
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:50,076
<i>- Great.
- (cell phone ringing)</i>

923
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:52,644
It's mine.

924
01:13:52,722 --> 01:13:54,487
- Hey, I'm Jeeter. How ya doin'?
- Hi.

925
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:57,029
<i>- Hello?
- (Emily) Ollie?</i>

926
01:13:57,898 --> 01:14:00,993
<i>- Hi.
- Are you still in NeW York?</i>

927
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:04,064
Yep. Can you hold on one second?
It's bad reception right here.

928
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,422
Found it.

929
01:14:20,975 --> 01:14:23,274
How does it look?

930
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:26,176
Looks good.

931
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:34,255
<i>- She was young, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

932
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,662
What kind of flowers did you get?

933
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:43,038
Blue.

934
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:46,849
That's perfect.

935
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:56,034
Today's her birthday.

936
01:15:00,782 --> 01:15:02,182
Talk to me.

937
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:05,954
I don't know what to say.

938
01:15:06,024 --> 01:15:08,018
Doesn't matter.

939
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:14,739
All right.

940
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:19,073
There's...

941
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,347
There's this kid, OK?

942
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:26,453
<i>And he"s in his backyard
and he"s digging a hole.</i>

943
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:33,966
And the neighbor lady
looks over the fence and says,

944
01:15:34,043 --> 01:15:36,207
"What you doing over
there, little Johnny?"

945
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,277
And the kid looks really sad

946
01:15:39,354 --> 01:15:41,880
and he says, "Well, my goldfish died.

947
01:15:41,957 --> 01:15:45,418
<i>"And so l"m having a funeral for it. "</i>

948
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:49,496
And the lady says,

949
01:15:49,606 --> 01:15:52,737
"Well, that's an awfully big hole
for a goldfish."

950
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:55,247
<i>And little Johnny says.</i>

951
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:58,949
"Well, that's because he's
inside your stupid cat."

952
01:16:05,737 --> 01:16:07,569
You know, that's terrible.

953
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:16,381

I'm gonna miss her.

1013
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,556
Well, no one can say
we didn't try, right?

1014
01:20:52,636 --> 01:20:55,904
- Just need the keys.
- Oh! Yeah.

1015
01:20:56,777 --> 01:20:59,373
Hey, can I hang on to the key chain?

1016
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:03,184
- They're, like, 25 bucks.
- You serious?

1017
01:21:03,256 --> 01:21:06,592
Yeah.
Aw, keep it.

1018
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,597
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:15,636

01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:33,707
Hey, you come to LA, give me a call.

1023
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:35,978

Well, what am I looking for here?
The guy?

- No, not the guy.
- Whatever happened to that guy?

1119
01:32:15,007 --> 01:32:18,172
The photos.
They're from before we met.

- Before you and who met?
- Me and Oliver.

- What are you talking about?
- He took them before I even saw him.

1122
01:32:25,193 --> 01:32:27,890
So he did make the first move.

1123
01:32:28,934 --> 01:32:31,234
Kind of.

1124
01:32:31,305 --> 01:32:33,739

- Michael needs a new suit.

1127
01:32:38,652 --> 01:32:40,587
I can't let him shop alone.

1128
01:32:50,104 --> 01:32:52,404
Talk. Tell me.
Do I look fat?

1129
01:32:52,478 --> 01:32:54,970
Seriously.
The pinstripes, they make me look fat?

you've tried on today.

It's a suit.

give in the shoulders.

01:34:13,662 --> 01:34:15,631
- Have you seen my tie?
- I don't... Did you look in your room?

1150
01:34:15,698 --> 01:34:17,997
Yes. I don't know where it is.

1151
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,198
You better find it.

1152
01:34:20,273 --> 01:34:22,003

- Why did he take your tie?

1155
01:34:25,317 --> 01:34:28,345
I don't know.
Why? Give it to me.

1156
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:31,922
Hi, I've been trying this number
all morning and I was just wondering

1157
01:34:31,994 --> 01:34:33,692
if you could find out
if there's something wrong with the line,

1158
01:34:33,765 --> 01:34:35,291
or if it's been disconnected,

1159
01:34:35,368 --> 01:34:37,234
or if I can make an emergency
breakthrough.

1160
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:42,106
- She's sleeping.
- OK. OK. Thanks anyway.

1161
01:34:42,213 --> 01:34:43,408
Is everything packed?
I brought the minivan.

1162
01:34:43,516 --> 01:34:47,822
- I'm not moving.
- What's going on?

1163
01:34:50,197 --> 01:34:52,826
Ben and I broke up.

1164
01:34:52,902 --> 01:34:54,895
Honey.

1165
01:34:55,974 --> 01:34:59,742
Are you OK?
Why didn't you call me?

1166
01:34:59,814 --> 01:35:02,719
- What happened?
- I had to do this.

1167
01:35:04,322 --> 01:35:09,195
OK. We are gonna sit down
and we are going to take a deep breath.

1168
01:35:10,434 --> 01:35:12,734
It's gonna be fine.

1169
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,908
It is so natural to be nervous
before you get married.

1170
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,277
Do you remember me?

1171
01:35:18,349 --> 01:35:20,579
Don't worry, Ben is gonna understand.

1172
01:35:20,652 --> 01:35:23,591
You just need to talk to him.
Just set a time to meet.

1173
01:35:23,658 --> 01:35:25,560
Tell him you need a day or two
to think things over.

1174
01:35:25,628 --> 01:35:28,725
- I have to call Oliver.
- Oliver?

1175
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:31,601
- Who doesn't have call waiting?
- Sweetie.

1176
01:35:31,673 --> 01:35:33,734
I have to talk to him.
I have to tell him I'm not getting married.

1177
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:35,939
Stop.
Give me the phone.

1178
01:35:36,582 --> 01:35:40,282
- I saw him.
- You saw who?

1179

When?

1183
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:08,064
Hi, I have a phone number
and I was wondering if

1184
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:10,668
you could give me the address
that goes with that phone number.

1185
01:36:10,746 --> 01:36:12,215
What are you gonna say?

1186
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:14,945
I'm gonna say I broke it off with Ben.
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

1187
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,719
Oh, no, no.
I wasn't speaking to you. Sorry.

1188
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:20,262
OK, you ready?
Here it is.

1189
01:36:20,332 --> 01:36:22,994
I forgot the number.
Find the number.

1190
01:36:23,101 --> 01:36:27,042
- Hold on, I'm looking, I'm looking.
- She's looking, she's looking.

1192
01:36:38,029 --> 01:36:40,466
Are you ready, gentlemen?

1193
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,872
Ready?
Yeah.

1194
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:47,038
- All right.
- Let's get started.

1195
01:37:15,969 --> 01:37:17,231
Hello?

1196
01:37:45,422 --> 01:37:48,622
<i>(Woman) Honey, are you OK?
Shall I call a doctor?</i>

1197
01:37:48,694 --> 01:37:51,792
I'll get somebody to help you.
Go get somebody to help her.

1198
01:37:51,868 --> 01:37:52,996
- Call 9-1-1.
- Just get her some ice...

1199
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,868
Are you OK?

1200
01:37:55,242 --> 01:37:58,145
- I got it. I got her.
- I'm sure there's a doctor...

1201
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:00,546
- I got her. It's fine.
- OK.

1202
01:38:01,219 --> 01:38:03,847
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1203
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:07,326
- What are you doing here?
- I'm so sorry. I have to go.

1204
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:09,592
Excuse me, are you here with the ice?

1205
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:12,828
How did you find me?

1206
01:38:12,907 --> 01:38:16,176
I had your number and I just...
I called Information and got your address.

1207
01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:19,844
Wow. Information sure gives out
a lot of information.

1208
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,617
- I got this.
- All right.

1209
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:24,855
It's good, thanks.
Is your head OK?

Yes.

1212
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,573
You should go.
I'm gonna go.

1216
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:01,122

I'm not getting married,
my sister is.

You're such a dick!
