www.titlovi.com

2
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:54,753
The Fuhrer's promises of peace and
prosperity have faIIen by the wayside...

3
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,997
Ieaving in their wake a path of destruction.

4
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:08,796
The outrages committed by HitIer's SS are
a stain on the honor of the German Army.

5
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:16,175
There is widespread disgust
in the officer corps...

6
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,150
toward the crimes committed
by the Nazis...

7
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:23,849
the murder of civiIians...

8
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:28,322
the torture and starvation of prisoners...

9
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:31,926
<i>...the mass execution of Jews.</i>

10
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:37,300
<i>My duty as an officer is no longer</i>
<i>to save my country.</i>

11
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,128
<i>but to save human lives.</i>

12
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,102
<i>l cannot find one general</i>
<i>in a position to confront Hitler</i>

13
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:47,475
<i>with the courage to do it.</i>

14
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:51,515
CoIoneI Stauffenberg, sir.
The GeneraI wiII be here in four hours.

15
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,712
Thank you.
I'II need to see him when he arrives.

16
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:03,026
<i>l find myself surrounded by men</i>
<i>unwilling or unable to face the truth.</i>

17
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:07,223
<i>Hitler is not only</i>
<i>the archenemy of the entire world</i>

18
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,530
<i>but the archenemy of Germany.</i>

19
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,004
<i>A change must be made.</i>

20
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:20,540
CoIoneI, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hoId it.

21
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:21,638
That's what we'II do.

22
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:24,650
The British are moving up from the south,
Patton is cIosing in on the coast.

23
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,049
You know,
we shouId have Ieft two days ago.

24
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,813
No, CoIoneI.

25
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:30,981
We keep fighting untiI the finaI victory.

26
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,616
North Africa's Iost, and you're going to
need these men a year from now

27
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,353
to defend BerIin.

28
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,093
We can serve Germany or the Fuhrer,
not both.

29
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,959
It's just that sort of taIk
that had you sent here, CoIoneI.

30
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,164
What I said was much worse.

31
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,503
GeneraI.

32
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:56,245
I'm just trying
to get these men out of here aIive.

33
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,556
-What wouId you have me do?
-TeII Command we're Iow on water.

34
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,858
We'd have to reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

35
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,365
At Ieast then we'd have a chance.

36
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,600
And the records wiII show that we didn't
have enough water to reach Sidi Mansour?

37
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,435
I can guarantee it.

38
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,312
See that it's done.

39
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,247
GeneraI.

40
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,098
Up!

41
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,211
Down!

42
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,836
-HitIer's Ieaving.
-Now?

43
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,168
<i>Ja.</i> Fuse.

44
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,438
CoIoneI Brandt! CoIoneI Brandt!

45
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,076
My regards to CoIoneI Stieff.

46
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:35,820
Cointreau?
Let's hope I don't get thirsty on the fIight.

47
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,474
This is Tresckow.

48
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,126
He's Ianded.

49
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:25,769
This is GeneraI Tresckow.

50
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,705
Connect me with Operations,
CoIoneI Brandt.

51
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,639
CoIoneI! Tresckow.

52
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:36,145
I'm gIad you arrived safeIy.
I hate to troubIe you,

53
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:39,946
but it seems you have the wrong bottIes
for CoIoneI Stieff.

54
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,850
You do stiII have the package?

55
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:50,085
Oh, no, no, no. As it happens,
I've been caIIed to BerIin unexpectedIy.

56
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:53,461
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

57
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,933
Sorry for the inconvenience, CoIoneI.
Yes, thank you.

58
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,504
Do you think he knows?

59
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,408
WeII, there's onIy one way to find out.

60
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,581
-We've been discovered.
-What makes you think that?

61
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,355
Oster's been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him Iast night.

62
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,554
The Gestapo couId have arrested him
for anything.

63
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,928
-What do you think went wrong?
-We don't know.

64
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,437
Fuse. Temperature. AItitude.
AII I know is the damn thing didn't go off.

65
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:47,845
-GeneraI Tresckow to see CoIoneI Brandt.
-The CoIoneI's expecting you, sir.

66
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,426
At ease.

67
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,400
You'II forgive me, GeneraI.

68
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,933
This IittIe roundup
has had me writing reports aII day.

69
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:17,280
-Roundup?
-Dissenters.

70
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:22,682
-Another pIot against the Fuhrer.
-Who are these peopIe?

71
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,888
You'd be surprised.

72
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:36,196
Now, is this what you've come for?

73
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:46,402
Perhaps we shouId open it.

74
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,375
I beg your pardon?

75
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:53,817
WeII, you've come a Iong way.
You must be thirsty.

76
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,618
You know, I wonder how the Fuhrer,
who does not partake,

77
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:06,062
wouId feeI about a soIdier
who did so on duty.

78
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,330
CoIoneI Brandt.

79
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,770
I took you for another sort, GeneraI.

80
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,979
And I you.

81
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,057
We're stiII in business.

82
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,618
Find a repIacement for Oster.

83
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,255
There's no one we can trust, not in BerIin.

84
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:41,799
WeII, then stop Iooking in BerIin.

85
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,221
Countess von Stauffenberg?

86
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,826
Perhaps before you go in, we couId have
a word together in my office.

87
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,960
I wiII see my husband now.

88
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:28,011
The right hand has been amputated
above the wrist.

89
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,777
He's missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the Ieft hand.

90
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,115
We couIdn't save the Ieft eye.

91
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,173
CoIoneI.

92
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,448
When you're ready, sir.

93
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,922
<i>l'm a soldier. l serve my country.</i>

94
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,094
<i>But this is not my country.</i>

95
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:32,068
<i>l was lying out there bleeding to death.</i>
<i>thinking. ''lf l die now.</i>

96
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:35,004
<i>''l leave nothing to my children</i>
<i>but shame. ''</i>

97
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:41,278
I know now there's onIy one way
to serve Germany.

98
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,581
In doing so, I'II be a traitor. I accept that.

99
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,245
Just teII me,
can these men see it through?

100
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,959
We need to reorganize.
Reconsider our strategy, recruit new men.

101
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:02,299
That's why we want you.

102
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,164
You understand what wiII happen
to my wife and chiIdren

103
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,708
if these men can't see it through?

104
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,806
Come and hear what they have to say.

105
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:31,788
You know where to find us.

106
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:02,250
Enough! Enough. I'm not going to Iisten
to another word of this.

107
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:04,557
You had your chance, you faiIed.

108
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,191
Your so-caIIed ''centraI soIution''
didn't work.

109
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,201
Our onIy option now
is to confront HitIer openIy.

110
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,395
This is a miIitary operation...

111
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,996
It's not a miIitary operation,
it's a poIiticaI organization,

112
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,473
and one that's given its miIitary arm
too much controI.

113
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:18,634
In any miIitary exercise,

114
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,576
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation.

115
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:24,376
A measure? A measure?
What about totaI, compIete, utter faiIure?

116
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,680
GentIemen, I think it's time
we face the fact

117
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:30,243
that the AIIies are coming, sooner or Iater.

118
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,846
I say we sit back
and Iet them wipe out the Nazis.

119
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:36,122
And ask every Iiving souI in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

120
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:38,185
-CarI, pIease.
-I'm sorry, Ludwig.

121
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,822
I've heId my tongue too Iong.

122
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:43,561
We must confront HitIer now.
Force him out!

123
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:45,160
And then what?

124
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,467
I beg your pardon?

125
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,335
When HitIer is gone, then what?

126
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,038
I'm sorry, who is this man?

127
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:59,084
CoIoneI Stauffenberg
is Oster's repIacement.

128
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,643
He's been transferred to my office
at the War Ministry.

129
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:07,051
-How's your uncIe?
-He's weII, sir. He sends his regards.

130
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,527
-He speaks very highIy of you.
-And of you, GeneraI.

131
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:12,996
Of course, one of the things
that made Oster such a great organizer

132
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:15,897
was that he kept his opinions to himseIf.

133
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:21,099
I'm simpIy asking what you intend to do
when HitIer is gone.

134
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,232
You don't reaIIy beIieve you couId just
waIk into the Reich ChanceIIery

135
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,574
and command the army to end the war?

136
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,134
Yes. We do.

137
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:38,079
You are in the presence of men
who wouId have been HitIer's inner circIe.

138
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:40,647
Instead, we refused, CoIoneI.

139
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,183
The peopIe know we put our principIes
above personaI gain.

140
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:47,699
We have the respect of the peopIe.
And the army.

141
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,901
Then you don't need me. GentIemen.

142
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,375
<i>Those men are confusing</i>
<i>respect with popularity.</i>

143
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:06,546
The army swore an oath,
an oath that won't just die with HitIer.

144
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:07,744
What are you going to do?

145
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,253
How are you going to deaI with GoebbeIs?
HimmIer? The SS?

146
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,257
-They wiII wipe you out!
-It doesn't matter!

147
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:19,228
It onIy matters that we act, now,
before we Iose the war.

148
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:23,493
Otherwise, this wiII aIways be
HitIer's Germany.

149
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:30,374
And we have to show the worId
that not aII of us were Iike him.

150
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,035
That is not enough for me.

151
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,905
There has to be a chance of success.

152
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,076
Then find a way.

153
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,851
<i>Poppy!</i>
<i>Poppy!</i>

154
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,788
-Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
-Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

155
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:47,051
Mommy, he's here!

156
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,822
-Mom, come down!
-Poppy's here!

157
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:03,571
I thought we agreed
I'd come see you in Bamberg.

158
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:06,701
-The chiIdren couIdn't wait.
-The chiIdren?

159
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:50,118
Super!

160
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,159
<i>Valkyrie.</i>

161
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,662
We've aIready considered VaIkyrie.
It isn't suitabIe.

162
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,859
Not as it's currentIy written,
but the CoIoneI has an idea

163
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:45,494
-I think we shouId consider.
-Excuse me. What is VaIkyrie?

164
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,163
Operation VaIkyrie.

165
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,538
The Reserve Army has thousands of men
aII over BerIin.

166
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,134
VaIkyrie is HitIer's contingency pIan

167
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:55,771
to mobiIize those men
during a nationaI emergency.

168
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:58,281
The soIe purpose of the order
is to protect HitIer's government

169
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:01,512
-if he's cut off or kiIIed.
-And what use is this to us?

170
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:05,250
VaIkyrie is designed
to contain civiI unrest.

171
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:08,054
But what if the SS were staging a coup?

172
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,161
State Security is trying
to overthrow HitIer.

173
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,394
-How wouId High Command respond?
-We wouId have no choice.

174
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,198
We wouId decIare
a miIitary state of emergency.

175
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,965
ExactIy, and initiate VaIkyrie.

176
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,940
HitIer's own Reserve Army,
using HitIer's own pIan,

177
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,638
wiII have no choice but to seize power
in BerIin to prevent the SS takeover.

178
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:33,409
They'II think they're fighting
for HitIer's government, not against it.

179
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:36,784
WhiIe we quietIy put
a new government in pIace.

180
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,089
But onIy if he's dead.

181
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,051
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

182
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:46,619
How eIse are you going to convince peopIe
the SS are trying to seize power?

183
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,597
We have to kiII HitIer.

184
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm disappointed in you, CoIoneI.
I thought a man of your background

185
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:55,061
wouId suggest
a more honorabIe approach.

186
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,769
Your pIan has a few
minor obstacIes, CoIoneI.

187
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:02,244
FirstIy, VaIkyrie wouId have
to be rewritten to excIude the SS.

188
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:05,044
Then I'II need your heIp to get a copy.

189
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,317
Rewriting an order is one thing.

190
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,051
Distributing it is another.

191
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,454
In this case,

192
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:17,086
we'd be wiIIfuIIy circuIating
written evidence of high treason.

193
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:19,824
Evidence requiring HitIer's signature.

194
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,403
WeII, we can aII draw straws for that job.

195
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:31,607
-And what about Fromm?
-Fromm? Who is Fromm?

196
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,304
He's the commander of the Reserve Army.

197
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:38,008
I can put the reserve troops on aIert,
but onIy Fromm can initiate VaIkyrie.

198
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,083
Can you get to him?

199
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:49,516
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

200
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:50,823
He's a careerist pig.

201
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,490
But one who's gone as far as he can go
in HitIer's army.

202
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:55,589
It's no secret he's not happy about it.

203
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,602
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

204
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:01,271
Make him see the Iight.

205
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:11,743
Your office is through there.

206
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,751
I have CoIoneI Stauffenberg
for GeneraI Fromm.

207
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,690
CoIoneI Stauffenberg, sir.
WeIcome back to the War Ministry.

208
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,990
-It's an honor, sir.
-You're an oId woman, Fromm !

209
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:25,324
I'd send you to the front

210
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:29,390
if I didn't think you'd surrender
just to be Montgomery's whore!

211
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,031
The GeneraI wiII see you now.

212
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:53,386
What is it you want?

213
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:57,552
I wanted to introduce our new man,
CoIoneI Stauffenberg.

214
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:01,587
From Africa.

215
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:06,029
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

216
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:11,665
I'd say the GeneraI has Iost
more important things this morning.

217
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:21,146
It's about time they put somebody
with baIIs into this office.

218
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:24,882
PIease, sit down, CoIoneI.
And you, OIbricht, if you must.

219
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,268
They teII me you're criticaI
of the war, CoIoneI,

220
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,864
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

221
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,909
I am criticaI of indecision, GeneraI.

222
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,968
-In the fieId?
-In BerIin.

223
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:52,444
So that's why you're here, I take it, to...

224
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:55,509
-To make decisions.
-I've aIready made my decision.

225
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,146
I'm here to heIp others make theirs.

226
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:05,458
They say when there's no cIear option,

227
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:11,364
-the best thing is to do nothing.
-We're at war. We must act.

228
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,336
Sometimes rashIy.

229
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,873
And what rash action
did you have in mind, CoIoneI?

230
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:25,182
That wouId be a decision
for the supreme miIitary commander, sir.

231
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,780
A supreme commander.

232
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:33,119
Second onIy to the ChanceIIor.

233
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,492
If I were that man,

234
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,768
this war wouId be going quite differentIy.

235
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,832
WeII, we were thinking the same thing.

236
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:00,483
I don't need to remind you

237
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:04,917
that we've aII sworn an oath

238
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,982
to the Fuhrer.

239
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:19,836
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took pIace,

240
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,372
in the strict understanding

241
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,272
that such taIk never occurs again
under this roof.

242
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:25,969
-Is that cIear?
-Yes, sir.

243
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:30,503
Now, you can teII your friends, CoIoneI,
that I aIways come down on the right side.

244
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:35,383
And as Iong as the Fuhrer is aIive,
you know what side that is.

245
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:44,991
<i>Heil</i> HitIer.

246
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,122
<i>Heil</i> HitIer.
<i>Heil</i> HitIer.

247
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:21,996
Of course! Yes! Very good guess!

248
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,726
You reaIize how cIose I am to HitIer.

249
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,522
With one word I can make you disappear.

250
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,291
My associates don't know
we've been taIking,

251
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:56,459
-if that's what you're afraid of.
-When the SS catch you,

252
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:59,867
they wiII puII you apart Iike warm bread.

253
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,906
It wiII be a crime
just to have known you then.

254
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:06,465
I warn you, don't try to contact me again.

255
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,035
You won't report me.

256
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,637
Maybe if you had
when I first approached you,

257
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:14,082
you might have been keeping your oath.

258
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,642
Now you're just as guiIty as the rest of us.

259
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,051
And you think that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

260
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,750
Give a man a choice of betraying
his feIIow officer or his Fuhrer

261
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:23,349
and you think his actions
wiII show you his heart.

262
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:26,363
-It is not that simpIe.
-Yes. Yes, it is.

263
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:30,162
For the Iast time,
don't push me to make a decision.

264
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:32,896
I don't have a choice. It's cIear now.

265
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,672
Without you, there is no hope of success.

266
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:40,767
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

267
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,211
What makes you think
you'II be any different?

268
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,840
What makes you think you're stronger
than the peopIe, the Reich?

269
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,852
-The very momentum of history!
-This is going to happen.

270
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,377
Action is inevitabIe,
as are the consequences.

271
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,947
When they come for me,
I'II do everything I can

272
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,616
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

273
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:57,423
but don't deIude yourseIf.

274
00:31:57,494 --> 00:31:59,554
You were invoIved in a crime
against your country

275
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,530
Iong before you met me.

276
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,634
There may stiII be time
to redeem yourseIf.

277
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:12,233
OnIy God can judge us now.

278
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,183
HitIer had Operation VaIkyrie designed

279
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:24,017
to compIeteIy secure his government
in six hours.

280
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:28,752
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize
controI of the government in three.

281
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:30,488
As written,
the order spreads reserve troops

282
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,996
across aII of Germany's
19 miIitary districts,

283
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:37,090
incIuding occupied cities
Iike Paris, Vienna and Prague.

284
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:38,933
<i>This is a waste of resources.</i>

285
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:42,872
<i>Since all of these districts follow</i>
<i>orders from Berlin without question.</i>

286
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:45,375
<i>you take Berlin. you take Germany.</i>

287
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:48,405
I'm rewriting VaIkyrie

288
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,106
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

289
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:52,342
to focus entireIy on BerIin.

290
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:57,144
We'II surround the government quarter,
occupy aII SS and poIice barracks.

291
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:01,659
Once we have controI of the government,
we'II shut down aII concentration camps.

292
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:04,422
Any officers who resist
wiII be arrested or shot.

293
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,987
I've been transferred to the front.

294
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:11,835
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

295
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:14,769
You know these orders
better than anyone.

296
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:18,433
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the miIitary wing of the operation.

297
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,807
-Beck agrees.
-Why not OIbricht?

298
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:23,939
No. It's your pIan. It's you.

299
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:27,176
One more thing.
You need to be absoIuteIy certain

300
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:29,277
no confIicting orders get out
after the fIash.

301
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,845
It is not enough to kiII HitIer.

302
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,685
We need to isoIate his chain of command

303
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,317
and cut them off
from the outside worId immediateIy.

304
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:41,161
Yes, I've aIready considered that.
I think I have just the man who can heIp.

305
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:45,031
-Who is he?
-Perhaps it's better I don't say.

306
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,506
You know, God promised Abraham
he wouId not destroy Sodom

307
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:55,943
if he couId find just 10 righteous men.

308
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:59,779
I have a feeIing that, for Germany,
it may come down to one.

309
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:07,690
Let's begin.

310
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,490
''The Fuhrer, AdoIf HitIer,

311
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:15,831
''is dead.''

312
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:24,737
<i>Heil</i> HitIer, GeneraI.

313
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,170
WouId you excuse us, pIease? Thank you.

314
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:41,487
You pIay the part
of bureaucrat beautifuIIy.

315
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,150
It's the onIy time I get to reIax.

316
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:46,789
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.

317
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:49,992
-Excuse me?
-CongratuIations.

318
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:55,233
-I am busy with other things.
-UnfortunateIy,

319
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,867
your nocturnaI activities
don't count as service to the Reich.

320
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:02,275
-I'II refuse the promotion.
-You'II do no such thing.

321
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:04,940
Tresckow may have Ieft you
in charge of the operation,

322
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:06,880
but in this worId I stiII outrank you.

323
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,385
You wiII accept the promotion.

324
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:14,481
You'II have reaI access to HitIer,
his advisers, his scheduIe. We need this.

325
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:20,297
I've Iooked through your changes
to VaIkyrie.

326
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,163
I approve.
I'II need you to get HitIer to sign it.

327
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,969
Now. There's a man here to interview
as your adjutant.

328
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:34,204
He comes highIy recommended.

329
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,543
CIose the door.

330
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:48,255
Be seated.

331
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:55,054
Do you know
how this war wiII end, Lieutenant?

332
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,027
The portrait wiII be unhung,

333
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:01,329
and the man wiII be hung.

334
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:12,041
I'm engaged in high treason
with aII means avaiIabIe to me.

335
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:13,878
Can I count you in?

336
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:24,322
For anything, sir. Anything at aII.

337
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:26,916
Come. Come, come.

338
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,456
CoIoneI Brandt, Operations.

339
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:41,527
CoIoneI Stauffenberg, I'd Iike to review
your presentation to the Fuhrer.

340
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:42,630
StrictIy routine.

341
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:45,197
Sir, the contents of the CoIoneI's bag
are for the Fuhrer's eyes onIy.

342
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:47,300
I am the Fuhrer's eyes, Lieutenant.

343
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:49,471
The CoIoneI is a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

344
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,572
He doesn't answer to you.

345
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:57,048
-They're waiting.
-This way.

346
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:36,391
My Fuhrer.
May I present CoIoneI Stauffenberg,

347
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,396
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

348
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,824
<i>Heil.</i> my Fuhrer.

349
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,701
May I say what an honor it is
to meet an officer

350
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:54,472
who has sacrificed so much for Germany.

351
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:03,445
If onIy more of my men were Iike you.

352
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:07,487
Let this man stand
as an exampIe to aII of you.

353
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:10,356
He is the ideaI German officer.

354
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,632
My Fuhrer. CoIoneI Stauffenberg
was asked to come here today

355
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:20,728
to brief us on mobiIizing troops
of the Reserve Army to...

356
00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:22,704
To repeI the invasion.

357
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:25,605
Invasion?

358
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,670
At Normandy, my Fuhrer.

359
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:32,978
Oh, yes.

360
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:35,983
Normandy.

361
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:39,288
That wiII not be necessary.

362
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:45,425
<i>Reichsmarschall</i> Goring assures me that
everything is compIeteIy under controI.

363
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,961
Thank you, CoIoneI.

364
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:56,168
My Fuhrer, if I may.

365
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,175
I have an amended copy
of Operation VaIkyrie for your approvaI.

366
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:53,760
You know your Wagner, CoIoneI?

367
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,630
The VaIkyrie. Handmaidens of the Gods,

368
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:09,771
choosing who wiII Iive and who wiII die,
sparing the most heroic

369
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:13,643
from an agonizing death.

370
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:21,987
One cannot understand NationaI SociaIism

371
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:26,362
if one does not understand Wagner.

372
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,371
I'm sure whatever changes you've made
are for the best.

373
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:54,619
You're dismissed. Send your man home.
And, Fromm?

374
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:58,358
Have some fresh tea brought in, wiII you?

375
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:13,603
I don't know what you're brewing up,
and I don't want to know.

376
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,509
But when the music stops,

377
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:19,072
I'd be obIiged if KeiteI found himseIf
without a chair.

378
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,594
Any probIem on Earth can be soIved

379
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:37,998
with the carefuI appIication
of high expIosives.

380
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:41,436
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

381
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:47,000
Two 975-gram packs of PIastit W.
Enough expIosive to crippIe a panzer.

382
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:50,740
Your detonators, your fuses.
British time penciIs.

383
00:42:51,514 --> 00:42:54,882
This acid capsuIe is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

384
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:59,820
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time penciI, Iike so,

385
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:03,759
insert the entire device
into either end of the PIastit W,

386
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:07,889
crush the acid capsuIe, and you're Iive.

387
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:14,195
When the acid eats through the wire
hoIding back the firing pin,

388
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:16,934
weII, you'II want to be very far away.

389
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:21,438
For you.

390
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,012
-How much time wiII we have?
-TheoreticaIIy there's a 30-minute deIay,

391
00:43:25,081 --> 00:43:27,550
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the WoIf's Lair,

392
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:29,778
I'd give you 10, 15 minutes, tops.

393
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:31,753
That's hardIy precise.

394
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:35,280
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have smaII or precise, not both.

395
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,519
Might this just be a IittIe too smaII?

396
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:40,996
No. HitIer's bunker wiII magnify the bIast.

397
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:45,057
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
SteeI door, no windows.

398
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:48,469
The air pressure generated by just one
of these expIosives in a space Iike that

399
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:50,302
wiII kiII everyone instantIy.

400
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,637
The second charge
wiII be entireIy redundant.

401
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,543
If, by some miracIe,
HitIer does survive, what then?

402
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,980
We stiII initiate VaIkyrie.

403
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,416
At that point,
there wiII be no turning back.

404
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:03,646
But we'II have an advantage.

405
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,389
We have an inside man at the WoIf's Lair.

406
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:10,358
After the fIash, he'II cut off communication
with the outside worId.

407
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:12,760
WhiIe HitIer's inner circIe
is struggIing to regroup,

408
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:16,527
we'II have the momentum we need
to seize controI in BerIin.

409
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:19,831
HimmIer is expected to be
at the meeting as weII.

410
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:22,771
Don't proceed
unIess you can get them both.

411
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,329
What?

412
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:28,936
Don't proceed unIess you're confident
you can get both HimmIer and HitIer.

413
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,313
This is GoerdeIer, isn't it?

414
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:44,088
I'II hoId off, if the decision is unanimous,

415
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:48,153
but I want another man on the committee.
Not a poIitician.

416
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:50,496
-Who?
-Him.

417
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,467
-Him?
-Him.

418
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,530
Fine.

419
00:44:56,806 --> 00:45:02,574
But remember, this is a miIitary operation.
Nothing ever goes according to pIan.

420
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,677
I'II take the chiIdren to Bamberg.

421
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:44,085
If I faiI,

422
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:49,556
they'II come for you.

423
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:52,693
AII of you.

424
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:57,795
I know.

425
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,523
GentIemen. Good morning.

426
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:30,532
HitIer has scheduIed a miIitary briefing
for today at 1 :00.

427
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,092
Stauffenberg wiII start
once everyone is present.

428
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,971
-They're here.
<i>Before arming the explosives.</i>

429
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:38,940
<i>Stauffenberg will call</i>
<i>for authorization to proceed.</i>

430
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:43,878
<i>After the flash. his inside man</i>
<i>will sever all communications.</i>

431
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:46,472
<i>Assuming Fromm refuses to join us.</i>

432
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,710
<i>Olbricht would take command</i>
<i>of the Reserve Army</i>

433
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:50,719
<i>and initiate Valkyrie.</i>
-Initiate VaIkyrie.

434
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:55,157
<i>Then he'll notify all district commanders</i>
<i>that the SS is attempting to seize power.</i>

435
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:59,663
<i>The Reserve Army will arrest all SS.</i>
<i>Gestapo and Nazi officials.</i>

436
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,891
<i>By then. Stauffenberg</i>
<i>will have returned to Berlin</i>

437
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:04,434
<i>and taken command of the Reserve Army.</i>

438
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:08,164
<i>Witzleben and l will assume the roles</i>
<i>of commander of the armed forces</i>

439
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,728
<i>and head of state.</i>

440
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,001
<i>With Berlin secured.</i>

441
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:14,101
<i>Dr. Goerdeler will address the nation</i>
<i>as our new chancellor.</i>

442
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:17,043
Then, God wiIIing,

443
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:21,983
we can negotiate a truce with the AIIies
and save Europe from totaI destruction.

444
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:27,257
This wiII identify you
as a member of the operation.

445
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:30,623
Nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one.

446
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:36,231
GentIemen, this is the most important day
of your Iives.

447
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:41,394
Long Iive sacred Germany.

448
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:20,505
-Captain.
-What is it?

449
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,239
An order from GeneraI OIbricht's office.

450
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,873
It's caIIing the Reserve Army
for some sort of standby action

451
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:28,577
in aII the miIitary districts,
incIuding BerIin.

452
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:31,416
Looks Iike a driII of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

453
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:52,733
Sir?

454
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:03,246
-''Standby action''? What the heII for?
-The order doesn't say.

455
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:08,353
AssembIe the men.
This better not be a driII.

456
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,592
The men are assembIed
and awaiting further orders.

457
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:56,632
What do you suppose
this is reaIIy aII about?

458
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:19,972
Your man?

459
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:32,652
He is now.

460
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:53,431
CoIoneI.

461
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:07,014
Attention!

462
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:22,556
GentIemen. For our first order of business,

463
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:25,193
GeneraI Fromm wiII present his pIans

464
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:29,068
for the reaIIocation of troops from
the Reserve Army on the eastern front.

465
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:32,130
Now, as you know, Iast night
the Russians Iaunched a new offensive

466
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:36,269
against Army Group North Ukraine
in the South PoIand section.

467
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,474
GeneraI Harpe was brought in
to repIace ModeI

468
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,244
and bring a swift end to this confrontation.

469
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,048
-HimmIer is not here.
-Hence the transfer of three divisions

470
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:49,717
to fortify GeneraI Harpe's troops.

471
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:54,956
Now, these divisions wiII stick
to a mobiIe defense pIan

472
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,295
rather than hoIding any one particuIar...

473
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:05,635
Yes, sir. I'II put that right through.
Connecting now.

474
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,699
<i>Operator.</i>
-Direct me to the War Ministry.

475
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:09,472
-GeneraI OIbricht's office.
<i>One moment. please.</i>

476
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:11,570
Yes, sir. Connecting now.

477
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:17,715
-GeneraI OIbricht's office.
-HimmIer's not in the briefing.

478
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:19,414
I'm ready to arm. Permission to proceed.

479
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,452
HoId the Iine.

480
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:25,427
Stauffenberg says HimmIer's not
at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

481
00:56:25,494 --> 00:56:26,826
CaII Beck.

482
00:56:29,632 --> 00:56:32,295
-Beck.
<i>Himmler is not at the briefing.</i>

483
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:36,034
HimmIer's not at the briefing.

484
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:48,313
...aIready diminished reserves.

485
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:52,311
<i>No.</i>

486
00:56:56,492 --> 00:56:57,652
They say no.

487
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:02,724
What do you say?

488
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,003
I say do it.

489
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:11,237
Attention!

490
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:49,835
Whatever it was, CoIoneI,
I hope it was important.

491
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:54,742
CoIoneI? Your bag.

492
00:58:19,275 --> 00:58:22,802
This has been a driII! You're dismissed!

493
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:30,217
How dare you put the Reserve Army
on standby without my knowIedge?

494
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:31,914
Damn near cost me my commission.

495
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:34,650
And what in God's name made you think
you even had the authority?

496
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:38,989
-It was onIy a driII, an exercise.
-Don't Iie, OIbricht! Not to me.

497
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:41,163
We both know it wasn't a driII.

498
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:43,722
-GeneraI, if I may...
-No, you may not, CoIoneI.

499
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,427
You may not do anything.

500
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:47,594
Because not onIy have you proved to me
you can't deIiver,

501
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,367
you've painted a target on my back.

502
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,398
If I so much as sense you trying
to move the Reserve Army again,

503
00:58:54,476 --> 00:58:57,309
I wiII personaIIy have you both arrested.

504
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:02,416
Do I make myseIf abundantIy cIear?

505
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:04,282
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

506
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:10,751
<i>Heil</i> HitIer.
<i>Heil</i> HitIer.

507
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:15,159
I'II hear you say it, CoIoneI.

508
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,773
<i>Heil</i> HitIer!

509
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:39,851
The point of repIacing HitIer
is to negotiate a truce with the AIIies.

510
00:59:39,922 --> 00:59:42,356
The AIIies, I suspect,
wouId be more amenabIe to a truce

511
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,451
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking BerIin!

512
00:59:45,527 --> 00:59:48,929
There's no point in kiIIing HitIer
unIess you kiII HimmIer, too.

513
00:59:48,998 --> 00:59:51,523
Why remove a madman
just to have a Iunatic take his pIace?

514
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,364
Today's faiIure had nothing to do
with HimmIer, and you know it.

515
00:59:54,436 --> 00:59:58,099
This is a miIitary operation
in the hands of a poIitician, nothing more.

516
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,472
-What are you suggesting?
-I'm not suggesting anything.

517
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,568
I'm stating the facts as I see them.

518
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:05,614
You don't have the courage to kiII HitIer,
so you are making the task impossibIe.

519
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:08,809
Nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own.

520
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:11,079
My onIy regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone.

521
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:14,248
I don't think I'm aIone
when I say your judgment is in question.

522
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:16,257
-I'd Iike to caII a vote.
-CarI.

523
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:19,659
I propose
that we reIieve CoIoneI Stauffenberg.

524
01:00:21,197 --> 01:00:23,893
CarI, can I have a word with you
in private?

525
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:26,902
No, Ludwig.
If you've got something to say, say it.

526
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:30,405
Very weII. I heard from the Chief of PoIice
this evening

527
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:33,704
that HimmIer has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

528
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,038
You have to Ieave Germany tonight.

529
01:00:39,114 --> 01:00:42,175
When we succeed
with the centraI soIution,

530
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:44,742
you'II return as chanceIIor.

531
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,552
Disappear, CarI.
Avoid contact with anyone.

532
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,536
Good Iuck, CoIoneI.

533
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:14,215
No more indecision.

534
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:16,878
From now on,
Stauffenberg has fuII discretion.

535
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:20,081
I can't issue the aIert again
unIess we foIIow through.

536
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:23,420
I'II do my job. You just take BerIin.

537
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,568
<i>Hold on. sir.</i>
<i>l'll try to connect you right now.</i>

538
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:35,034
Thank you.

539
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:36,663
<i>Hello?</i>
-HeIIo?

540
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:39,302
HeIIo?

541
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,539
HeIIo?

542
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:49,447
<i>l'm sorry. sir. There is bombing in Ebingen.</i>
<i>We've been disconnected.</i>

543
01:01:50,686 --> 01:01:54,452
<i>Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.</i>
<i>l'm sure your family is safe.</i>

544
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:55,889
Thank you.

545
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,418
WeIcome, CoIoneI.

546
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:39,621
Do you have a pIace
where I couId change, Major?

547
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,989
PIease foIIow me.

548
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,335
At Ieast put the Reserve Army
on standby aIert.

549
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:53,398
Not untiI I've heard from Stauffenberg.
Not untiI I'm sure.

550
01:03:53,476 --> 01:03:56,934
-But that's not what he...
-Noted, CoIoneI. Thank you.

551
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:11,418
The meeting has been moved up to 12:30.

552
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:14,394
MussoIini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

553
01:04:14,463 --> 01:04:16,795
-The Fuhrer wants to have Iunch with him.
-Yes, sir.

554
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:20,266
WiII MussoIini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

555
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:21,701
I onIy wish he were.

556
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:24,398
Then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

557
01:04:24,474 --> 01:04:26,601
to shoot that dago bastard.

558
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,206
Excuse me, GeneraI.
I'm expecting an important caII.

559
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,510
CouId you pIease have someone come
and get me?

560
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:36,313
Even if I'm with the Fuhrer.

561
01:04:36,385 --> 01:04:38,945
-Of course, CoIoneI.
-Thank you, sir.

562
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:41,485
CoIoneI.

563
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:17,057
Major Freyend speaking.

564
01:05:26,702 --> 01:05:32,197
CoIoneI? They insist you hurry.
The briefing's about to begin.

565
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,135
One moment, pIease, Major.

566
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,681
Ten minutes.
Two for the waIk, one for the checkpoint,

567
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:46,244
one for the bunker, six to get out.

568
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:48,413
PIenty of time.

569
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:54,224
Excuse me, CoIoneI.

570
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:59,233
Sir! The Fuhrer's at the briefing!

571
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,539
The CoIoneI is changing, Major.

572
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:14,340
-You understand this can be difficuIt.
-Of course.

573
01:06:29,331 --> 01:06:30,889
PIenty of time.

574
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:58,588
-Get the car.
-But, sir...

575
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:01,322
I have everything I need. Get the car.

576
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,021
I can manage this.

577
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:46,905
-Where are they going?
-It's too hot.

578
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:50,206
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

579
01:08:15,103 --> 01:08:17,197
Major, my injuries
have Ieft me hard of hearing.

580
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,935
WouId you pIace me
as cIose to the Fuhrer as possibIe?

581
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,805
-I'II see what I can do.
-...against the Red Army.

582
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:25,108
Not onIy have they been advancing
from the east,

583
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,618
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as weII.

584
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:34,614
As you can see, my Fuhrer,
if the enemy continues at this rate,

585
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:38,126
the situation in the East Prussian sector
is criticaI.

586
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,456
Lack of suppIies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

587
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:44,556
and reserves are severeIy depIeted.

588
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:47,603
My Fuhrer,
you remember CoIoneI Stauffenberg?

589
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:57,170
As you are aII aware,

590
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:01,148
in the past two days aIone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

591
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:04,208
the 14th Division has been pushed
out of Livorno.

592
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:08,052
Army Group Center has aIready Iost
28 of their 40 divisions.

593
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:11,988
That is a totaI of aImost 350,000 men.

594
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:21,131
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearIy a month ago,

595
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:24,502
our troops have aIready been pushed back
to the PoIish border.

596
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:27,466
Conference hut.

597
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:31,137
This, compounded with the Ioss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

598
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:34,149
-threatens the entire eastern perimeter.
-Yes, sir.

599
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:37,618
We must consider puIIing men
from Army Group North Ukraine,

600
01:09:37,686 --> 01:09:39,154
as weII as the Romanian...

601
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:46,985
...and prevent further Iosses.

602
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:50,055
UnIess we can quickIy dispatch
new bIocking divisions

603
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:53,192
at vitaI points aIong the German right,

604
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:56,328
-Army Group wiII be swaIIowed...
-CoIoneI. There's a teIephone caII for you.

605
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:57,804
...by the enemy in Iess than a fortnight.

606
01:09:57,873 --> 01:10:01,673
And we run the risk of Iosing
aII the ground we have managed to gain

607
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:05,578
in the Iast three years. Our spearhead...

608
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:08,673
GeneraI FeIIgiebeI, sir. He says it's urgent.

609
01:10:12,087 --> 01:10:14,613
Yes, GeneraI, this is Stauffenberg.

610
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:22,354
...Russian air activity has proven just
as impregnabIe as their ground force.

611
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,524
-Why?
-My Fuhrer...

612
01:10:31,673 --> 01:10:34,666
In some areas
they outnumber us seven to one.

613
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:40,011
If we can afford to give ground
aIong the ItaIian front, I further...

614
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:45,278
One thing is certain,

615
01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:49,119
the Red Army wiII continue
an aggressive push west,

616
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,215
even at the expense...

617
01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:56,764
In order to rebuiId at this...

618
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:08,439
...aIready southwest of Dunaburg
and cIosing on Army Group at Lake Peipus.

619
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:12,970
If they are not immediateIy withdrawn,
it wiII be a catastrophe.

620
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:38,462
Get in. Drive.

621
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:42,904
I have orders from the Fuhrer. Drive.

622
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:45,875
Drive! Drive!

623
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:50,850
As you were.

624
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:25,750
Get me the War Ministry.
GeneraI OIbricht. OIbricht!

625
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,583
The caII is urgent!

626
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,253
GeneraI OIbricht's office.

627
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:34,886
<i>l'm calling from the Wolf's Lair</i>

628
01:12:34,963 --> 01:12:37,694
<i>with an urgent message</i>
<i>for General Olbricht.</i>

629
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:41,760
<i>Something terrible has happened.</i>
<i>The Fuhrer is...</i>

630
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:45,404
FeIIgiebeI?

631
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,600
Sever aII communications.

632
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:50,338
-Sir?
-Just do it!

633
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:57,518
-WeII, what did he say?
-I couIdn't be sure.

634
01:12:58,654 --> 01:13:00,985
WeII, get him back on the Iine.

635
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:05,591
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was cIear.

636
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:08,720
FeIIgiebeI's next step wiII be
to sever aII communications.

637
01:13:19,574 --> 01:13:22,567
-Sorry, CoIoneI. No one gets in or out.
-We have an order from the Fuhrer.

638
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,805
We have to get to the airfieId immediateIy.
Open the gate.

639
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,643
I'm very sorry,
but my orders are to keep the gate...

640
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:30,583
-I just gave you an order, Sergeant.
-Sir!

641
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:32,814
Sir. Excuse me.

642
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:43,488
CoIoneI Stauffenberg
for FieId MarshaI KeiteI.

643
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,967
CoIoneI Stauffenberg was expIicit.
We initiate VaIkyrie regardIess.

644
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,668
OnIy Fromm can initiate. You know that.

645
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:57,645
Then teII him HitIer's dead.
Or arrest him. But do it now.

646
01:13:57,712 --> 01:14:01,581
Sir, you have to give the order
to initiate VaIkyrie. This is our onIy...

647
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:03,743
I'm not doing anything
untiI I hear from FeIIgiebeI.

648
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,081
Get him back on the phone now.

649
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:07,520
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second Iost.

650
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,023
The risk is too great.

651
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:12,060
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

652
01:14:12,127 --> 01:14:14,426
He did his part,
and now you're abandoning him.

653
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:19,029
FieId MarshaI, sir. Stauffenberg here.
A Sergeant...

654
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,363
KoIbe, sir.

655
01:14:20,435 --> 01:14:22,096
-What?
-KoIbe.

656
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,730
...KoIbe won't Iet me pass the main gate.

657
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:26,832
Yes, sir, I expIained that.

658
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:29,672
Perhaps you can
make him understand, sir.

659
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:37,645
Everything's fine now, sir. Thank you.

660
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:42,479
Open the gate!

661
01:14:51,332 --> 01:14:54,564
-At Ieast put the Reserve Army on aIert.
-When Stauffenberg returns,

662
01:14:54,636 --> 01:14:58,903
when he gives me confirmation
that HitIer is dead, then we'II proceed.

663
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:09,279
-And where are you going?
-The same pIace as you are. Lunch.

664
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,420
Another standby aIert.

665
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,886
Send it through. But keep me informed.

666
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:25,784
Sir. Another standby order.

667
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:32,449
In ancient Greece,
you wouId have been kiIIed for this.

668
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:35,756
Lucky for you we've evoIved.

669
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,761
AssembIe the men.

670
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:31,476
Quiet, isn't it?

671
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:36,051
I'II see where our driver is.

672
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:40,922
This is von Haeften.
The CoIoneI and I are at the airfieId.

673
01:18:40,996 --> 01:18:42,520
There's no car. There's no one here.

674
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:48,065
You mean to teII me
the aIert's onIy just gone out?

675
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,529
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me GeneraI OIbricht.

676
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:00,581
What's this?

677
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,114
-ExpIain this!
-Someone had to do something

678
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,215
whiIe you were pIaying dead!

679
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:11,315
We don't know that HitIer is not aIive.

680
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:14,487
This is about Germany, for God's sake,
not you!

681
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:29,466
GeneraI OIbricht's office.
CoIoneI Stauffenberg. For you, sir.

682
01:19:36,984 --> 01:19:38,815
-This is OIbricht.
<i>lt's been three hours. Olbricht.</i>

683
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:40,149
What the heII have you been doing?

684
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:42,547
We've had no confirmation
that HitIer was dead.

685
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:49,128
Damn it! I saw the expIosion myseIf!
We are committed.

686
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:52,824
-Dear God.
-Now, where is Fromm? Is he with us?

687
01:19:53,368 --> 01:19:56,394
<i>ls he with us?</i>
-No one has spoken to him yet.

688
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:12,576
You Iisten to me. Never mind Germany.
Never mind Europe.

689
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:14,884
Your Iife is at stake now.

690
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:17,390
<i>And if you want to live through the night.</i>
<i>you'll do exactly as l say.</i>

691
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:20,618
The second you hang up the phone,
initiate VaIkyrie in Fromm's name.

692
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:23,658
Give him the choice to join us,
or pIace him under immediate arrest.

693
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,631
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

694
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,636
I'II be in Fromm's office in 15 minutes.
Be there when I arrive.

695
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:03,728
CaII Beck and the others.
TeII them it's time.

696
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:11,778
Put me through to Communications.

697
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,274
This is GeneraI OIbricht,

698
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:18,644
<i>calling on behalf of General Fromm.</i>
<i>commander of the Reserve Army.</i>

699
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,018
<i>The Fuhrer. Adolf Hitler. is dead.</i>

700
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:22,613
A group of radicaIs in the SS

701
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:25,158
are attempting to seize controI
of the government.

702
01:21:25,226 --> 01:21:27,387
<i>lnitiate Operation Valkyrie.</i>

703
01:22:03,698 --> 01:22:06,827
You have your orders. Pass them aIong.

704
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:47,201
BattaIion. Attention!

705
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,337
The Fuhrer...

706
01:22:57,185 --> 01:22:59,448
Our Fuhrer, AdoIf HitIer,

707
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,353
is dead.

708
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:09,655
-Who toId you the Fuhrer was dead?
-GeneraI FeIIgiebeI. At the WoIf's Lair.

709
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:14,833
There's no use caIIing.
AII communication Iines are down.

710
01:23:14,903 --> 01:23:17,997
-Yes. Get me the WoIf's Lair.
<i>One moment. sir.</i>

711
01:23:21,976 --> 01:23:23,534
<i>Wolf's Lair. May l connect you?</i>

712
01:23:23,612 --> 01:23:26,911
Yes. GeneraI Fromm
for FieId MarshaI KeiteI. Urgent.

713
01:23:31,185 --> 01:23:34,279
<i>Keitel.</i>
-Yes, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

714
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:36,085
but I wonder if you couId teII me
what's happening.

715
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:38,887
The most incredibIe rumors
are circuIating in BerIin.

716
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,551
I don't know what you mean.

717
01:23:40,628 --> 01:23:43,927
There's taIk
that the Fuhrer has been assassinated.

718
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,167
<i>Another failed attempt.</i>

719
01:23:47,802 --> 01:23:50,328
The Fuhrer was never in danger.

720
01:23:50,404 --> 01:23:53,771
By the way,
where's your man Stauffenberg?

721
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:58,409
Stauffenberg? He...
On his way back to BerIin, I wouId think.

722
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:02,404
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd Iike a word with him.

723
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:13,185
-The Fuhrer's fine.
-That is a Iie. AdoIf HitIer's dead.

724
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:16,957
-Operation VaIkyrie is in effect.
-OnIy I can initiate VaIkyrie.

725
01:24:17,032 --> 01:24:18,260
You did.

726
01:24:27,475 --> 01:24:28,500
This is treason.

727
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:31,409
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming controI of BerIin.

728
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,243
Are you with us or not?

729
01:24:33,314 --> 01:24:35,908
Do you reaIize what you've done?

730
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:38,042
-The Fuhrer is aIive.
-I deIivered the bomb myseIf.

731
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:40,280
I saw the bIast. He is dead.

732
01:24:43,057 --> 01:24:45,618
-Are you with us?
-I don't beIieve this is happening.

733
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:49,027
-This is some kind of a joke.
-Are you with us or not?

734
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:54,399
CoIoneI, if what you say is true,
you shouId shoot yourseIf immediateIy.

735
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:58,064
-The rest of you are under arrest.
-No, GeneraI. You are.

736
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:06,479
I don't know where you think this is going.

737
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:11,145
Get me Operations.

738
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:13,784
This is CoIoneI Stauffenberg.

739
01:25:13,854 --> 01:25:16,323
SeaI off the War Ministry
per Operation VaIkyrie.

740
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:17,448
No one gets in or out

741
01:25:17,525 --> 01:25:19,993
without authorization
from GeneraI OIbricht's office.

742
01:25:37,378 --> 01:25:42,213
GeneraI Beck.
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

743
01:25:42,283 --> 01:25:45,377
This shouId be seen
as a movement of the peopIe.

744
01:25:51,326 --> 01:25:54,351
-CoIoneI Stauffenberg?
-Yes.

745
01:25:59,033 --> 01:26:02,970
The chief has guaranteed
the fuII support of the BerIin PoIice.

746
01:26:04,905 --> 01:26:08,671
You wiII have no interference
from my men. You have my word.

747
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:13,412
Thank you.

748
01:26:49,216 --> 01:26:52,618
CoIoneI Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

749
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,091
Thank you for coming.

750
01:27:04,932 --> 01:27:08,493
GentIemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

751
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:10,400
that the government quarter is ours

752
01:27:10,471 --> 01:27:13,872
and SS Command has been cIeared
of every Iiving souI.

753
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:16,774
You aII know what must be done.

754
01:27:17,645 --> 01:27:20,171
By nightfaII, I want to know
that HitIer's Germany

755
01:27:20,247 --> 01:27:21,976
has seen its Iast sunrise.

756
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:55,712
Yes, sir.
AII repIacements have been authorized.

757
01:27:55,783 --> 01:27:57,216
In fact, FieId MarshaI WitzIeben

758
01:27:57,284 --> 01:27:59,219
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

759
01:28:00,188 --> 01:28:01,712
That's exactIy why he's been appointed.

760
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:04,350
If he was a member of the Party,
he'd be Iocked up as a suspect.

761
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:06,587
Yes, sir, I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

762
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:08,390
The commanding officer
at the 1 1th District, pIease.

763
01:28:08,462 --> 01:28:09,487
I need a decision, Major.

764
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,622
TeII your men that acts of vengeance
wiII not be toIerated.

765
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:13,429
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the TegeI broadcasting station?

766
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:15,195
Can I speak to the commanding officer
in Hannover, pIease?

767
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,532
We represent
a different form of government.

768
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:18,003
I'd be carefuI who you said that to.

769
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:19,664
LoyaIty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

770
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,573
-Yes, Paris. France.
-Not since they murdered the Fuhrer.

771
01:28:22,644 --> 01:28:24,167
And, Josef. Thank you.

772
01:28:24,244 --> 01:28:25,609
You've made the right decision.

773
01:28:27,716 --> 01:28:28,739
District 13 is ours.

774
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:42,823
By order of FieId MarshaI von WitzIeben,

775
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:46,127
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

776
01:28:54,842 --> 01:28:57,208
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to
connect with Major-GeneraI Thadden.

777
01:28:57,278 --> 01:28:58,744
No, I've aIready spoken to 413 BattaIion.

778
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:00,439
You'II have no troubIe
getting reinforcements.

779
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:02,380
The order expIaining everything
wiII be in your hand shortIy.

780
01:29:02,516 --> 01:29:05,145
No, these are your orders. ExceIIent.

781
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:09,712
My wife is in Bamberg with my chiIdren.

782
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,257
WouId you pIease try to raise them
on the phone?

783
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:13,350
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

784
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:15,328
GeneraI SchwedIer
has issued the VaIkyrie orders

785
01:29:15,396 --> 01:29:16,454
and has seaIed off headquarters.

786
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,395
Good. Check on the radio stations
every 20 minutes

787
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:20,695
tiII we have confirmation they're ours.

788
01:29:33,414 --> 01:29:35,814
WeII, with aII due respect, sir,
you can't beIieve everything you hear.

789
01:29:35,884 --> 01:29:37,715
That is SS propaganda. He's dead.

790
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:41,846
OnIy the commander of the Home Army
is authorized to give orders.

791
01:29:41,922 --> 01:29:44,083
GeneraI? Sir.

792
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:46,920
-HeIIo, Christian?
-Our men in the transport offices

793
01:29:46,994 --> 01:29:48,552
have secured
the raiIway communications network,

794
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:49,654
but there are repeater stations...

795
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:51,595
-Yes. I give you my word.
-...teIephone and teIegraph offices,

796
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,792
emergency broadcast outposts.
We need more men.

797
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:56,393
Thank you. Give my best to your famiIy.

798
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:57,938
He's with us.

799
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,068
Mertz? CaII Potsdam.

800
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,574
TeII them to pIace aII avaiIabIe units
under our controI.

801
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:04,440
You have your men.
Now get controI of the radio.

802
01:30:04,511 --> 01:30:06,445
We have controI
of the government quarter.

803
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:08,538
We don't have BerIin yet.

804
01:30:31,773 --> 01:30:34,640
-What is it now, Sergeant?
-Arrest orders, sir.

805
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:36,609
One from CoIoneI Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

806
01:30:36,677 --> 01:30:39,305
to arrest Reich Minister GoebbeIs.

807
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:43,475
The other is from the WoIf's Lair,
to arrest CoIoneI Stauffenberg.

808
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:51,123
Send them both through.

809
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:57,163
Our job is not to interpret orders,
our job is to pass them aIong, regardIess.

810
01:30:57,231 --> 01:30:59,962
-Yes, but...
-That wiII be aII, Sergeant.

811
01:31:19,753 --> 01:31:23,850
This is treason! You're aII going
to pay for this! Do you hear me?

812
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:40,962
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and GoebbeIs.

813
01:31:42,443 --> 01:31:44,377
Do we arrest them both?

814
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,939
I wouId hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

815
01:31:48,015 --> 01:31:51,610
-You reaIIy think it's a coup?
-Of that I am certain.

816
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,184
What I can't say is which side we're on.

817
01:31:55,856 --> 01:31:57,586
Come with me.

818
01:31:57,658 --> 01:32:00,650
District 4, Dresden and Leipzig.
District 12, Wiesbaden. District 9...

819
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:02,354
They've had no troubIe
getting reinforcements,

820
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:05,399
and I reIy on you seeing
that this gets done.

821
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:10,134
I've just spoken to CoIoneI Linstow.

822
01:32:10,204 --> 01:32:14,198
They've arrested 1,200 SS
and Gestapo officiaIs in Paris.

823
01:32:14,274 --> 01:32:15,867
Not a singIe shot fired.

824
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:20,039
EarIy reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on word from Prague.

825
01:32:20,113 --> 01:32:21,512
IncredibIe.

826
01:32:55,015 --> 01:32:56,506
I'm ready to be connected.

827
01:33:11,064 --> 01:33:15,091
-Minister GoebbeIs?
-What can I do for you, Major?

828
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:18,296
My battaIion has an order
to bIockade the government quarter

829
01:33:18,372 --> 01:33:20,500
and pIace you under arrest.

830
01:33:23,845 --> 01:33:26,871
Are you
a dedicated NationaI SociaIist, Major?

831
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:29,445
Yes, sir.

832
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:47,530
Major Remer here. HeIIo?

833
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:52,630
<i>Do you recognize my voice?</i>

834
01:33:55,109 --> 01:33:58,510
-Yes, my Fuhrer.
<i>Then listen to me very carefully.</i>

835
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:03,676
<i>l want these traitors taken alive.</i>

836
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,543
Yes, my Fuhrer.

837
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:16,322
You heard what he said.
The Fuhrer wants the traitors taken aIive.

838
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:19,962
Yes, sir.

839
01:34:45,193 --> 01:34:49,891
It's a coup, aII right. We can't afford
to remain neutraI any Ionger.

840
01:34:54,135 --> 01:34:56,296
You have to make a decision.

841
01:34:58,072 --> 01:35:01,404
When it's over,
we better wind up on the right side.

842
01:35:07,948 --> 01:35:09,314
Very weII.

843
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:14,077
Send through aII communications
from the WoIf's Lair.

844
01:35:14,154 --> 01:35:16,953
Stop aII communications
from Stauffenberg.

845
01:35:22,997 --> 01:35:24,692
ReIease these men!

846
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:28,398
But they're part of the coup.

847
01:35:28,469 --> 01:35:30,960
I've just been on the phone
with HitIer himseIf.

848
01:35:31,038 --> 01:35:34,007
We are the coup, you idiot.
We've been duped.

849
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:39,704
We've Iost contact with District 1 1 .

850
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:47,010
The switchboard is overIoaded.
Give it 10 minutes and try again.

851
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:54,256
Give me GeneraI BieIer, District 1 1 .

852
01:35:54,328 --> 01:35:55,693
We stiII need...

853
01:35:55,762 --> 01:35:57,525
-I don't want to Ieave any section...
-Keep trying.

854
01:35:57,597 --> 01:36:01,328
Out of my way. Where is GeneraI Fromm?

855
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,904
GeneraI Fromm is no Ionger in command.
I am.

856
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:10,603
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

857
01:36:10,677 --> 01:36:13,805
The Fuhrer is dead.
The SS are staging a coup.

858
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:16,542
We've initiated Operation VaIkyrie
to crush the uprising

859
01:36:16,617 --> 01:36:18,140
and save HitIer's Germany.

860
01:36:18,219 --> 01:36:21,551
You wiII present the order to your troops.

861
01:36:21,622 --> 01:36:24,784
I wiII do no such thing
untiI I speak to GeneraI Fromm.

862
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:28,260
You wiII foIIow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

863
01:36:29,697 --> 01:36:35,293
This is treason. I wiII take no part.
The Fuhrer is not dead.

864
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:38,171
-The Fuhrer is not dead!
-Stop him !

865
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:41,765
The Fuhrer is not dead!
The Fuhrer is not dead!

866
01:36:41,842 --> 01:36:45,279
I have sworn an oath! This is treason!

867
01:36:45,345 --> 01:36:48,542
You aII swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

868
01:36:48,615 --> 01:36:52,143
You are aII making a terribIe mistake!

869
01:36:52,987 --> 01:36:55,079
The Fuhrer is not dead!

870
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:59,421
The Fuhrer is not dead!

871
01:37:01,429 --> 01:37:03,453
PIease try my wife again.

872
01:37:12,372 --> 01:37:14,000
Bamberg, pIease.

873
01:37:20,448 --> 01:37:22,381
Take your hands off me!

874
01:37:28,322 --> 01:37:29,413
Sir.

875
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:43,362
<i>Over 215 enemy tanks</i>
<i>have been annihilated</i>

876
01:37:43,436 --> 01:37:45,371

878
01:37:48,074 --> 01:37:50,565
<i>on enemy concentrations...</i>
-Lieutenant.

879
01:37:50,645 --> 01:37:51,703
I can't get through to GeneraI GerIach.

880
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:54,975
Send a runner down to his office.
Bring him here.

881
01:37:57,984 --> 01:37:59,542
Yes, thank you.

882
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:02,015
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

883
01:38:02,088 --> 01:38:04,523
I was speaking to the GeneraI
about five minutes ago.

884
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:07,390
He toId me he'd return my caII.
I've yet to hear from him.

885
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:09,985
I trust everything in your district
is under controI?

886
01:38:10,064 --> 01:38:14,296
Hans, I need your answer.
There's no more time for indecision.

887
01:38:14,368 --> 01:38:16,996
And the GeneraI knows I'm waiting?

888
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:18,537
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediateIy.

889
01:38:18,605 --> 01:38:20,470
The army gave their oath to a Iiar, Hans.

890
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,135
-HeIIo?
-One who's broken his own oath...

891
01:38:23,211 --> 01:38:25,577
-HeIIo?
-...to the peopIe a hundred times over.

892
01:38:25,645 --> 01:38:27,476
Hans, Iisten to me...

893
01:38:53,975 --> 01:38:57,069

Stand down!

GeneraI. Sir.
We have to get you out of here.

By orders of the Fuhrer,
you're under arrest.

931
01:44:08,421 --> 01:44:11,823
If you have any Iast messages
to your wives and chiIdren,

I wiII hear them now.

933
01:44:15,895 --> 01:44:17,090
Very weII.

934
01:44:17,163 --> 01:44:19,291
A court-martiaI convened by me
in the Fuhrer's absence

935

wiII pronounce sentence.
Beck, you're under arrest.

936

CoIoneI Mertz von Quirnheim,
GeneraI OIbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

937
01:44:27,942 --> 01:44:30,136
and the CoIoneI
whose name I wiII not mention,

938
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:31,609
are condemned to death.

939
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:34,146
GeneraI. My orders are
to take these men aIive.

940
01:44:34,213 --> 01:44:35,703
Noted, Major.

941
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,409
I'd Iike a pistoI, pIease.

942
01:44:42,155 --> 01:44:43,987
For personaI reasons.

943
01:45:02,309 --> 01:45:03,798
Get on with it.

944
01:45:03,877 --> 01:45:06,106
-With aII respect...
-That wiII be aII, Major.

945
01:45:06,212 --> 01:45:08,476
KiIIing us won't hide your invoIvement.

946
01:45:08,548 --> 01:45:11,814
My invoIvement?
I don't know what you're taIking about.

947
01:45:11,885 --> 01:45:14,752
-You knew and did nothing.
-You're as guiIty as any of us.

948
01:45:14,822 --> 01:45:18,622
-Spare me, Lieutenant.
-No one wiII be spared.

949
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:36,604
I'm thinking of earIier times.

950
01:45:42,615 --> 01:45:46,244
This is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here!

951
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:51,347
A fieId marshaI and a generaI decIare
that they couId do things better

952
01:45:51,425 --> 01:45:54,154
than he who is the Fuhrer of us aII!

953
01:45:54,228 --> 01:45:57,856
-You confess to having said this?
-Yes.

954
01:46:02,935 --> 01:46:07,532
<i>My fellow Germans.</i>
<i>l speak to you tonight for two reasons.</i>

955
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:12,841
<i>First. so that you can hear my voice</i>
<i>and know that l am unhurt.</i>

956
01:46:13,747 --> 01:46:17,842
<i>Second. so that you may know</i>
<i>the details of a crime</i>

957
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:19,613
<i>without parallel in German history.</i>

958
01:46:21,087 --> 01:46:25,286
<i>A small clique of ambitious.</i>
<i>dishonorable officers</i>

959
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:27,657
<i>have conspired to eliminate me.</i>

960
01:46:29,162 --> 01:46:34,692
<i>Except for a few bruises and burns.</i>
<i>l was completely untouched.</i>

961
01:46:36,369 --> 01:46:38,997
<i>l see in this the hand of Providence.</i>

962
01:46:40,373 --> 01:46:42,807
<i>directing me to complete my work.</i>

963
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:54,283
Look them in the eye.

964
01:46:56,422 --> 01:46:58,618
They'II remember you.

965
01:46:58,692 --> 01:47:00,091
OIbricht!

966
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:11,961
Make ready.

967
01:47:27,386 --> 01:47:31,413
<i>Well. we have to show the world</i>
<i>that not all of us were like him.</i>

968
01:47:36,729 --> 01:47:38,823
Safe! Stand!

969
01:47:42,935 --> 01:47:44,061
Fire!

970
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:46,765
Stand!

971
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,551
Stauffenberg!

972
01:48:13,567 --> 01:48:17,002
<i>The people know we put our principles</i>
<i>above personal gain.</i>

973
01:48:17,069 --> 01:48:18,469
