1
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,915
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,457
We have visual on
a possible high-value target.

3
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:13,993
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:17,591
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,766
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,040
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,085
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,322
Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo

9
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:33,765
one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.

10
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,600
Confirm you have visual.

11
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:37,073
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:39,203
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:41,784
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,337
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,344
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:01,322
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,566
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,862
Got it.

19
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:12,311
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:15,650
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:16,781
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,056
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:24,531
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,236
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,581
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:35,218
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,854
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:40,028
CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,

29
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,937
based on reliable intel from the Brits.

30
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,343
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,973
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,848
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:07,723
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,264
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:17,312
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:19,181
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,587
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:25,562
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,966
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,439
Ls that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,538
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:37,212
marker for the five pillars of lslam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,688
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:42,856
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,903
We can invoke hors de combat.

46
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,978
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:51,312
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,098
Mr. President,

49
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:05,043
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:08,643
The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral.

51
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:12,420
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:15,091
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,499
All right, what's your recommendation?

54
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:28,617
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:33,701
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:39,476
And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
I'm putting our people at risk.

57
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:41,954
You have a go.

58
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,725
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,805
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:56,316
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,754
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:03,262
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,182
Target is lased.

64
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,855
Master arm on.

65
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,454
Missiles away.

66
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,540
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,721
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:55,362
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,213
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:02,685
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,415
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:05,925
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,120
Look at the table.

74
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,100
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:13,334
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,934
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,108
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:18,582
How long?

79
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,954
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,225
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,665
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:26,997
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,370
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,444
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,173
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,944
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,384
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,151
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,851
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,262
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,233
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,468
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:48,548
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:51,643
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,747
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,384
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,021
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:57,132 --> 00:07:00,127
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:01,639
And then before you know it,

100
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:02,937
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:04,137
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,648
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,117
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,122
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,420
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,055
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,567
This is the dream right here.

108
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,036
Are you a man?

109
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,300
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,673
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:21,213
Big boy game.

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,884
Call.

113
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:25,750
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,350
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,557
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:32,365
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:34,465
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,170
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,507
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:41,076
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,524
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:44,788
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,764
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,704
l'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,298
All right, man.

126
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,283
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,557
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,293
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,372
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,237
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,333
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,927
Cell phone users, beware.

133
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,240
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
can now hear everything you're saying,

134
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,509
even when your cell phone is turned off.

135
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:31,149
Authorities can now activate
the microphone inside your phone,

136
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,095
allowing them to eavesdrop
on you and your conversations.

137
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:39,334
Experts say the only way around this
is to take the battery out of the device.

138
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,746
- The death toll now stands at 14.
- Now arriving at Union Street.

139
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:43,838
- Stand clear of the doors.
- Excuse me.

140
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,886
Watch your step, please.

141
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,552
Did you drop this?

142
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:52,491
Yes.

143
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,811
- It's hard to do on a train, you know!
- Doors closing.

144
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,744
Standing passengers...

145
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,418
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:46,403
Jerry?

147
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:50,349
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:51,855
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,790
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,024
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:59,402
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,066
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:03,340
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,441
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:07,783
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,688
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,696
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:16,429
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,210
One second.

161
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,813
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,818
What?

163
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,654
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:39,428
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,094
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,334
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:49,184
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:56,361
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:57,437
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:59,336
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,636
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:04,410
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,749
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,015
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,091
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:10,355
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:13,698
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,586
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,267
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,495
I don't want your money.

181
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,616
Can I have your attention, please?

182
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:17,063
Smoking is not permitted on the train.
Chicago is next.

183
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:39,644
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,777
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:45,682
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,820
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,767
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,503
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,703
Came over here.

190
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,783
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:00,287
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,725
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:07,625
Let's go!

194
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,004
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,772
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,870
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,041
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:16,713
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:18,086
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,855
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,899
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,697
- Mr. And Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,398
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,975
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,067
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,980
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,715
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,726
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,063
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,763
Capitol Limited to D.C. Is
departing now.

211
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,966
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,065
All aboard.

213
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,147
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,778
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:51,890
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,259
- Okay.
- L'll see you later.

217
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,995
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,769
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,311
It's unclear.

220
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,541
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,779
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,460
All aboard!

223
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,832
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:18,912
It's here. It's here.

225
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:22,621
Okay, okay.

226
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:41,121
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:49,974
No, wait.

228
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,634
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,966
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,805
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,116
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:14,621
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,597
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,173
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:20,674
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,144
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,582
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,051
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:27,920
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,086
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:31,894
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:46,586
Hello?

243
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,284
The FBI will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds.

244
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:50,986
You must flee the premises.

245
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,257
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,891
You've been activated, Jerry.

247
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,835
- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.

248
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:56,906
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:59,912
You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.

250
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,578
Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.

251
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,712
What is this?

252
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,988
The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.

253
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,086
- Listen.
- 17 seconds.

254
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,165
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,496
They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...

256
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,628
- I'm hanging this phone up now!
...violating state and local law.

257
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,574
- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.

258
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,671
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:22,087
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,855
Get on the ground!

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,762
Down now! Get down!

262
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,170
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:30,434
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,912
It's not mine! Lt's not mine!

265
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:46,369
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,380
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,509
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,923
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,594
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,401
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,843
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,144
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:10,280
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,952
Did you love your brother?

275
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,963
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:21,710
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,257
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,297
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:35,800
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:39,509
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:42,384
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,960
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,586
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:46,825
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:51,432
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,576
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:55,844
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:59,413
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,198
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,461
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:09,170
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:11,246
But your brother,

293
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,553
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,753
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:21,496
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,836
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,435
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,211
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,787
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,256
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,692
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:36,267
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:39,339
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,540
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,948
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:46,112
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,351
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,555
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:52,792
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:54,336
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,707
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,144
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,412
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,284
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,329
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,401
Well, l'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:12,338
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,673
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,808
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,787
Latest military spec.

321
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,119
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,892
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:24,989
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,763
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:29,240
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:30,538
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,046
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:35,019
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:39,221
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,132
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,804
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,207
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,779
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:48,973
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,451
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:54,084
I don't know! Lf I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,596
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:02,872
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,675
You read the paper.

340
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,921
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:12,863
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:15,801
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:18,137
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:23,778
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,005
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:35,169
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,123
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,257
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,462
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:55,419
Oh, gosh.

351
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:59,322
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:03,563
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:06,999
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:08,202
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,372
He's a suit. No.

356
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,711
You sure?

357
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,151
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,951
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,161
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,365
Hello?

361
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,171
Hello?

362
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:28,847
There's a McDonald's across the street.
Look in the window.

363
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,013
What is this?

364
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,721
Would you risk your life for your son?

365
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:41,246
Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.

366
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,112
- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.

367
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:45,211
- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,

368
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:46,915
unless you do what you're told.

369
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:47,992
What is this?

370
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,893
Don't go back inside the restaurant.

371
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:52,491
- What?
- There's a black Porsche Cayenne

372
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:55,336
parked at the northeast corner
of this block.

373
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:58,676
The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.

374
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,688
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,833
911.
State the nature of your emergency.

376
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,930
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,035
She was telling me that...

378
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,393
Your phone is being monitored.
Disobey again and your son dies.

379
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,068
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,146
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:33,518
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:35,113
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:36,692
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:38,286
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,763
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,392
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:44,374
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,913
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,680
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:25:49,787 --> 00:25:51,518
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,887
L'll do my best.

392
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:54,861
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:58,769
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:01,173
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:03,441
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:05,984
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:07,953
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:12,727
What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.

399
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,431
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,435
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,539
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:36,947
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,611
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,781
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,260
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:45,163
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:49,367
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:53,041
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:56,885
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:57,981
No.

411
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:09,078
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:12,280
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,058
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,601
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,701
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:36,536
We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.

417
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,541
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,477
Lay flat on the floor immediately.

419
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:41,981
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,211
Four seconds, Jerry.

421
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,483
- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- Get down now.

422
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:46,894
Two seconds.

423
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:11,164
No!

424
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:17,521
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,968
Shit.

426
00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:01,105
Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.

427
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:10,096
...fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,

428
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:13,034
with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning

429
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:17,202
of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs

430
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:20,307
on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,

431
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,719
near the border of Afghanistan.

432
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:37,853
Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform.

433
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:39,685
You will receive...

434
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:06,941
Doors closing. Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.

435
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,799
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:38,810
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:40,507
- What?
- You're not listening.

438
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:42,279
We told you to stay on the train.

439
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:45,086
- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.

440
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,925
A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit.

441
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:49,500
- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.

442
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:52,128
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:57,447
- Hello?
- The man in front of the exit door

444
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,046
in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.

445
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:03,253
- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?

446
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,026
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:09,131
Wilson Station. Exit now.

448
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:11,111
That's the guy!

449
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,019
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,464
Watch it!

451
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:45,815
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,511
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:49,088
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,093
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:53,189
- L'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,064
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,569
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:59,269
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,711
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,285
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:04,615
Drive.

462
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,588
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:12,262
Stop!

464
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:21,883
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:23,894
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,364
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:30,031
Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.
You have pursuers.

468
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,942
- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- No questions.

469
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:35,384
Turn right now.

470
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,361
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,369
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:46,441
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,203
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:49,372
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,383
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:52,952
Turn left now.

477
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,474
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:07,174
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:16,996
Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.
Stay in the second lane from the right.

480
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:19,507
- The light's red!
- Accelerate now.

481
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,094
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,431
Oh, shit.

483
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:39,313
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,258
Holy shit!

485
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:01,049
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:06,069
Get in close.

487
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:09,541
Go, go, go!

488
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,117
- Shit!
- Brake. Brake now.

489
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,192
Get in here!

490
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:29,344
Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.

491
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:33,621
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:35,427
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,003
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:43,338
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,452
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:50,585
Don't slow down.
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.

497
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:52,597
- Slow down. It's a red light!
- You will make it through.

498
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,135
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:56,463
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:34:58,144 --> 00:34:59,876
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,650
Manual control's been restored.

502
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:23,126
Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.

503
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,713
Enter the wrecking yard.
Proceed to the end of the dock.

504
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,550
We will eliminate all obstacles for you.

505
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,074
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:19,277
- Stay your course.
- Turn!

507
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,010
- Turn!
- Turn right now.

508
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:41,222
Holy...

509
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:54,884
Oh, God.

510
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,411
Oh, my God!

511
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:02,862
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,403
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,445
No!

514
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,135
The crane will release the car.
If you do not jump, you will drown.

515
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,445
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,318
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,052
Ready?

518
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,568
Go! Jump!

519
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:58,871
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,855
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,190
Move, move, move!

522
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:26,902
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,034
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:31,581
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,048
so l'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:36,123
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,420
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:42,626
Leave your message for Sam,
even though I know it's you, Mom.

529
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:46,005
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:48,981
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:53,454
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:57,163
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,793
What about the girl?

534
00:38:58,905 --> 00:39:00,875
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:03,469
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,244
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,822
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,690
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,431
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,340
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:20,641
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,686
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:25,019
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:28,724
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,061
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,831
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,873
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:38,851
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:40,478
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:43,594
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:46,164
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:39:46,268 --> 00:39:48,364
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,786
- Hello?
- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.

554
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:03,164
Leave the boatyard with the female.
Take Highway 123 East.

555
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,867
Walk to mile marker 108.

556
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,713
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:15,251
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:18,664
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,601
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:23,405
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:25,710
And l'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:29,221
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:33,230
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,358
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:38,442
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:41,309
Keep your phone on,
l'll keep you updated.

567
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,856
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:54,630
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:58,079
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:01,215
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:12,503
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:18,023
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:20,458
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,195
And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.

575
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:26,204
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:28,574
The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.

577
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,876
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:33,614
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:35,657
That frequency triggers the explosion.

580
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:42,197
Yeah.

581
00:41:42,974 --> 00:41:46,208
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,114
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:11,762
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:13,364
Thank you.

585
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:20,217
The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve.

586
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:21,786
Open the package.

587
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,121
- Okay.
- Remove the valve

588
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,532
and follow our instructions precisely.

589
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:41,255
- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.

590
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,695
- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.

591
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,360
Cut the stone and place the setting

592
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,632
according to the specifications
we sent you.

593
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,693
I'd just dropped my son off at the train.

594
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:36,637
I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.

595
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:39,338
- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.

596
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,648
- After the boxes?
- Yeah.

597
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,251
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,456
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:50,057
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:51,228
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,362
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:53,634
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:56,338
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:04,989
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,969
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:10,166
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:12,304
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:13,507
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,847
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,253
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:27,373
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:29,311
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,510
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,251
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,123
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:37,967
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:38,262
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,599
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,505
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,050
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,516
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,146
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:51,523
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:44:58,876 --> 00:44:59,844
Hey!

625
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,646
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:06,155
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:07,556
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:08,925
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,396
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,559
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,137
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:16,143
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,213
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:18,304
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,014
...do this because I'm lranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:24,617
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:26,527
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:28,659
- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.

639
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,331
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,411
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:34,675
- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?

642
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:37,152
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:40,090
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:16,490
- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.

645
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:19,403
Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.

646
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:24,246
72 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.

647
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:38,639
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,577
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,516
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:46,221
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:48,061
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,931
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. L'll take that.

653
00:46:50,038 --> 00:46:51,199
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:52,900
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,036
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,708
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:57,786
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:59,014
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:01,251
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,590
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,632
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,936
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:34,987
Okay.

664
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:38,862
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:42,969
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,612
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:50,159
- The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,759
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:56,338
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,206
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,539
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:48:31,646 --> 00:48:33,775
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:38,655
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,322
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,099
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,038
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:49:18,141 --> 00:49:20,168
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:49:22,148 --> 00:49:24,882
Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse

679
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:27,186
the United States
of launching American missiles

680
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:31,496
to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians.

681
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,005
The attack has triggered a
series of retaliatory suicide bombings

682
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,376
against American embassies abroad.

683
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:41,614
Early reports indicate the American
death toll now stands at 56,

684
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:44,492
with threats of further violence
here at home.

685
00:49:44,596 --> 00:49:46,063
Officials...

686
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:53,836
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:57,182
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:00,623
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:04,463
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,972
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:11,606
I can't make noises now?

692
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,083
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,682
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,027
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:20,726
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:23,672
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:27,547
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,117
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:32,784
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:35,023
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,626
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:39,708
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,340
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:44,313
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:46,389
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:46,945
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:13,141
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:15,237
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:18,114
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:28,804
I need you.

711
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,081
I could've gone.

712
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,429
I should have.

713
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:11,929
You are two minutes behind schedule.
Go to the alley behind the building.

714
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:18,735
- Go to the armored truck.
- I don't see an armored truck.

715
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,280
There it is.

716
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:30,634
In 20 seconds, men will exit
the elevator. They will be armed.

717
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:32,295
One will be carrying a briefcase.

718
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:34,568
Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van.

719
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:36,510
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.
- You want us to rob them?

720
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,083
You now have 15 seconds.

721
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,454
Security. What's your emergency?

722
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,077
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:05,333
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,501
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,547
You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

726
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,311
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:12,717
Drop the case and kick it to her!

728
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,552
Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,596
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

730
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,130
Okay! Easy.

731
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,538
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,610
Kick it!

733
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:28,007
Okay.

734
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,713
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:30,951
Easy.

736
00:53:33,498 --> 00:53:34,693
Back up.

737
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,599
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

738
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:39,197
- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

739
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:44,385
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!

740
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:58,338
Let's move, let's move!

741
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,458
Come on!

742
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,916
Jerry! Here!

743
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:23,826
Move, move!

744
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:28,842
Freeze! Police!

745
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:31,278
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

746
00:54:31,382 --> 00:54:32,646
We're security! We just got robbed!

747
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:35,052
And there they are! We just got robbed!

748
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:40,994
Move! Get out of the way!

749
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,639
Move!

750
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,985
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

751
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:51,056
Move!

752
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:55,253
- Hey, watch it, lady!
- Jerry, run!

753
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:56,735
This way!

754
00:54:59,974 --> 00:55:01,568
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:03,204
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,382
You see that? This way.

757
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,679
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:27,195
Please come. Please.

759
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:28,731
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:55:32,775 --> 00:55:33,766
Hi.

761
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,342
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,646
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,188
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,918
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,164
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:04,603
That's great.

767
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:29,590
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:31,525
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,791
Yes, sir.

770
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:36,596
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,577
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,943
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:56:41,048 --> 00:56:42,641
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:56:45,726 --> 00:56:47,855
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:56:47,963 --> 00:56:50,126
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:53,262
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,086
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,936
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:16,146
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:19,021
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:25,333
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:30,208
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:46,177
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:57:57,688 --> 00:57:59,181
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

785
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,820
Go to Macy's.
Customer Service Department.

786
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:03,661
Two Visa gift cards will be waiting.

787
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:05,704
You have 25 minutes
to purchase new clothes,

788
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:08,173
and then re-board the bus
for your next destination.

789
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:11,010
I'm done taking orders over the phone,
you understand?

790
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,130
Well, that was quick. You done playing
this hide-and-go-seek bullshit?

791
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:21,032
We are not hiding, Jerry.

792
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:24,632
To your left is a Circuit City.
Second floor, north corner.

793
00:58:24,744 --> 00:58:29,380
Go inside. Find the Home Theater
Center. We are waiting.

794
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:32,619
Second floor. She's here.

795
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:42,570
- Sir.
- Major.

796
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:45,512
- Major William Bowman.
- Agent Zoe Perez.

797
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:47,054
Welcome to Eagle Eye.

798
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:51,427

00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,755
- Hi, welcome to Circuit City. I'm Billy.
- We just need some time alone.

801
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,454
- We're having a sale...
- Okay, Billy, l'll find you later.

802
00:59:06,563 --> 00:59:07,690
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

803
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:11,530
Okay.

804
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:14,407
Okay, here it is. All right?

805
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:16,710
I'm done.

806
00:59:17,585 --> 00:59:19,179
- Hello?
- Mr. Shaw,

807
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,815
this is Miss Beck from
Midwest Cellular regarding your...

808
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:24,496
What is this?

809
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:28,666
- This is you. This is Jerry Shaw.
- What?

810
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:32,079
A series of purchases,
preferences, and quantifiable

811
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:34,983
data points that we define
as your personality.

812
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:42,731
We monitor every social network,
Internet logs,

813
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:44,637
instant and text messages,

814
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:48,610
known associates,
your friends, companions.

815
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:49,684
Jerry!

816
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:53,121
E-mails received and sent.
Cell phone usage.

817
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:55,422
- What happened to Red Lobster?
- We utilize security,

818
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:59,231
surveillance and traffic cameras
to analyze movements.

819
01:00:00,273 --> 01:00:03,039
We use this data
to form personality profiles.

820
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:05,844
Yeah, I'm calling actually about...

821
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:08,579
We know who you are.

822
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,126
...at least 30 minutes late.

823
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:11,889
Sam doesn't care!

824
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:13,329
We are everywhere.

825
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:15,300
What do you mean?
Why do you keep saying "we"?

826
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,568
We the people of the United States...

827
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:20,007
And so, my fellow Americans...

828
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:24,277
...in order to form a more perfect union,

829
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:26,291
establish justice,

830
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:28,590
insure domestic tranquility,

831
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:30,931
provide for the common defense...

832
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:32,369
All programmed options...

833
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:33,735
- Programmed options?
...sector searches,

834
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:38,250
and downloaded points of data
will lead to this central command.

835
01:00:39,655 --> 01:00:41,088
You're a computer.

836
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:44,356
Say hello to our
Autonomous Reconnaissance

837
01:00:44,465 --> 01:00:46,867
Intelligence Integration Analyst.

838
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,869
We call her Aria.

839
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:57,789
She crunches all our raw intel,
finds patterns,

840
01:00:57,891 --> 01:01:00,123
helps predict the movement
of possible suspects,

841
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,295
right down to behavior, motivation,
even personality.

842
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,809
Transferring primary search function
to auxiliary display.

843
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:14,251
- Hello, Secretary Callister.
- Aria.

844
01:01:14,692 --> 01:01:18,827
Agent Zoe Perez, Air Force OSI.
You are to assist her

845
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:22,840
- in her investigation of Ethan Shaw.
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.

846
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:28,284
Hello, Agent Perez. Perez, Zoe.
Middle name: Soledad.

847
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:31,791
Official service records indicate
your field reports are very thorough,

848
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:33,362
if poorly formatted.

849
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:38,601
Please excuse us.
Detecting 76% probability

850
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,737
valid threat at Los Angeles
International Airport.

851
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:44,581
Alerting airport authorities
and local police.

852
01:01:44,688 --> 01:01:47,284
Those gold spheres send her
infrared data,

853
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:49,760
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat.

854
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,603
She analyzes it and tells us
what to pay attention to.

855
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,244
Dispatch to Terrorism Task Force.
Threat at LAX.

856
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,115
We're still beta-testing,

857
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,416
but I'm pushing to get her online sooner.

858
01:02:08,971 --> 01:02:13,570
Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

859
01:02:14,547 --> 01:02:16,483
- Try to keep up.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:02:17,186 --> 01:02:19,454
And find out about Shaw.

861
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,221
- Major.
- Sir?

862
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:30,541
Your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity,

863
01:02:30,648 --> 01:02:33,711
education, career, even voting.

864
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:36,119
Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion

865
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:37,855
is necessary to motivate you.

866
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:40,833
Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.

867
01:02:40,936 --> 01:02:42,963
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

868
01:02:43,074 --> 01:02:45,704
His employment there was a cover.

869
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:49,047
Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one.

870
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:54,391
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:56,865
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

872
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:02,001
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

873
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:07,385
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

874
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:10,463
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

875
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:14,128
You are both required
to complete a task.

876
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:16,869
- What?
- The protection of our national security.

877
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:19,414
The Constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited

878
01:03:19,516 --> 01:03:20,847
- for the national defense.
- I'm done.

879
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:23,012
I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

880
01:03:23,123 --> 01:03:26,117
This is bullshit! I'm not serving
in the goddamn national defense!

881
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:29,065
We know all about him, Jerry. And you.

882
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:33,065
Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked.

883
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:36,907
The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.

884
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:40,454
- How did you get this?
- Look at Ethan.

885
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,927
They were uploaded
from his home computer.

886
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,626
You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.

887
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:48,365
- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.
- Ethan had these?

888
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:49,773
Come on, let's blow out the candles.

889
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:51,643
Just for a little bit.

890
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:55,916
Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent

891
01:03:56,023 --> 01:03:58,219
- that enabled Ethan to excel.
...Jerry, come on.

892
01:03:58,329 --> 01:04:00,059
- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.

893
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:04,003
You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.

894
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,168
Jerry, let your brother help you. Jerry!

895
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:10,411
You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.

896
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:21,967
We have 14 minutes.

897
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:30,885
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

898
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:33,693
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,931
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,510
They went right for the case.

901
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:43,246
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:04:43,353 --> 01:04:46,451
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,860
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,365
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,164
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:54,606
Lt was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,682
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:04:57,782 --> 01:04:59,275
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:04:59,387 --> 01:05:00,786
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:03,519
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:05,998
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:07,501
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,806
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,929
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,168
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:12,746
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:13,974
- No.
- All right.

918
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,949
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:17,818
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:05:17,923 --> 01:05:20,690
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:23,597
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:50,255
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:53,331
- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.

924
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:56,197
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,135
Shit.

926
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:04,085
Sam!

927
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:06,615
- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.

928
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:08,090
The train's awesome!

929
01:06:08,193 --> 01:06:09,891
- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,

930
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:11,831
- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.

931
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,666
Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.

932
01:06:13,773 --> 01:06:16,175
Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.

933
01:06:16,478 --> 01:06:19,813
You will see him again.
But there's something we require first.

934
01:06:21,554 --> 01:06:24,117
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:32,302
- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.

936
01:06:32,677 --> 01:06:34,978
You have six minutes
to return to the bus.

937
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,402
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,809
We should go.

939
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:55,880
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,992
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,467
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,541
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:07:04,643 --> 01:07:06,442
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:07:08,885 --> 01:07:11,014
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:07:12,592 --> 01:07:14,824
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:19,168
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:20,833
All right. All right.

948
01:07:20,943 --> 01:07:22,846
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:26,114
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:07:26,221 --> 01:07:28,454
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,324
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:34,130
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:07:34,237 --> 01:07:35,206
What time did they get on?

954
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:44,117
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:07:52,976 --> 01:07:55,469
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:58,074
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:07:58,686 --> 01:08:00,748
And I was not that way.

958
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:06,726
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:11,001
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:15,855
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:19,622
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,328
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:25,135
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:29,707
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:40,569
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:08:42,377 --> 01:08:47,514
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:51,360
I owe him that.

968
01:08:58,944 --> 01:09:02,179
We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.

969
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:07,488
Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.

970
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:08,689
Thank you.

971
01:09:10,201 --> 01:09:13,695
Attention, passengers. Please do not
leave your luggage unattended.

972
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:16,444
Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search

973
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:19,884
by the airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.

974
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:24,993
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:09:25,097 --> 01:09:28,798
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:09:28,905 --> 01:09:32,470
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:35,282
They now have them.

978
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:42,430
That's a nice picture.

979
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:52,078
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:53,917
Work the secure area first.

981
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:55,423
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,997
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:09:58,099 --> 01:09:59,931
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,916
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:10:12,028 --> 01:10:14,055
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,273
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:23,283
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,481
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:28,925
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:32,297
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:33,770
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:36,207
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:39,511
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:10:42,088 --> 01:10:44,024
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:10:44,126 --> 01:10:47,224
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,801
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:56,850
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,097
Wait.

999
01:11:03,432 --> 01:11:08,636
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,426
Go ahead.

1001
01:11:21,537 --> 01:11:23,131
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,645
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:28,181
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:29,947
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:33,618
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:36,757
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:11:38,771 --> 01:11:42,644
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:45,274
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,012
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:04,386
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:06,583
Move!

1012
01:12:14,746 --> 01:12:17,181
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,355
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:23,426
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:12:33,652 --> 01:12:34,744
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:37,347
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:42,229
Thank you.

1018
01:12:57,065 --> 01:12:59,059
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:31,192
Go, go, go!

1020
01:14:25,546 --> 01:14:26,515
Move!

1021
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,882
Set the briefcase down.

1022
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:00,305
Open it.

1023
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,672
Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.

1024
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:07,414
- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.

1025
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:09,458
- The cargo hold is unpressurized.
- Take this.

1026
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,000
The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen.

1027
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,091
No.

1028
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:17,238
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:16:17,342 --> 01:16:18,402
Roll your...

1030
01:16:18,511 --> 01:16:20,037
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:22,847
- We have to. Ready?
- You have a 92% chance of survival.

1032
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:24,252
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:16:24,356 --> 01:16:26,828
Do it now, or you will suffocate.

1034
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:30,502
Okay.

1035
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,497
Get in the crate.

1036
01:16:32,608 --> 01:16:33,769
No. No.

1037
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,342
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,024
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:48,368
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:16:48,474 --> 01:16:49,873
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:16:49,975 --> 01:16:53,506
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:01,162
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:03,235
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:17:03,337 --> 01:17:05,466
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:17:06,845 --> 01:17:09,315
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,715
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:17:10,819 --> 01:17:12,948
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:17:13,057 --> 01:17:15,460
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:16,997
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,399
Lt can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:17:19,503 --> 01:17:20,529
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,802
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:17:22,911 --> 01:17:26,042
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:17:26,952 --> 01:17:28,251
I'm sorry.

1055
01:17:29,757 --> 01:17:33,893
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:38,173
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:39,869
Well, let me see.

1058
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:44,849
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:47,085
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:49,063
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,399
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:17:53,539 --> 01:17:56,011
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,182
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:02,119
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:04,822
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,559
He is a shithead.

1067
01:18:07,368 --> 01:18:10,773
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:18:11,243 --> 01:18:14,181
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:19,855
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:18:21,465 --> 01:18:24,631
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:30,782
And then this one night,

1072
01:18:32,654 --> 01:18:35,626
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:18:38,265 --> 01:18:40,828
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:18:41,872 --> 01:18:43,706
And that little face...

1075
01:18:48,485 --> 01:18:51,617
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:54,895
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:19:03,484 --> 01:19:07,355
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:19:12,469 --> 01:19:15,167
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:16,868
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:19:16,978 --> 01:19:22,216
Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.

1081
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:24,759
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,765
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,469
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:35,806
Did you see that?

1085
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:37,716
With his cell phone.

1086
01:19:42,764 --> 01:19:44,926
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:19:45,034 --> 01:19:46,833
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:58,287
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,798
- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.
- No.

1090
01:20:00,935 --> 01:20:03,634
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:20:03,739 --> 01:20:05,766
- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.

1092
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:07,404
Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.

1093
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:09,451
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:20:09,551 --> 01:20:10,918
Video sequence erased.

1095
01:20:11,021 --> 01:20:13,390
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:15,259
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:20:15,363 --> 01:20:18,234
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:28,454
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:31,159
This way.

1100
01:20:47,262 --> 01:20:48,993
It's a memory card

1101
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:52,168
from Ethan's cell phone.

1102
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:58,143
Aria, listen. You do not have
permission to exceed your authority

1103
01:20:58,252 --> 01:21:00,814
and act independently.
Do you understand?

1104
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:19,922
Let's go.

1105
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:44,668
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:21:45,082 --> 01:21:46,072
Go ahead.

1107
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:49,587
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:53,654
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:55,530
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:21:55,636 --> 01:21:57,195
- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.

1111
01:21:57,306 --> 01:21:59,070
On a project called Eagle Eye.

1112
01:21:59,177 --> 01:22:01,613
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:02,740
It's big.

1114
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,217
I'm about to download...

1115
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:09,628
Perez? Perez!

1116
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:24,819
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,231
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:45,634
for the State of the Union.

1119
01:22:45,739 --> 01:22:47,207
We really just need three minutes
of your time.

1120
01:22:47,309 --> 01:22:49,073
Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?

1121
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,170
Yes, sir.

1122
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:53,948
301 to 306. We are confirmed go
for a State of the Union lockdown.

1123
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:13,149
Sir, all the threats we've been tracking,

1124
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:15,631
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:23:28,895 --> 01:23:31,730
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,096
To warn us.

1127
01:23:33,203 --> 01:23:34,637
I'm ordering you to cease...

1128
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:42,247
I'm ordering you to cease and desist.

1129
01:23:42,354 --> 01:23:44,119
Our abort
recommendation was contravened,

1130
01:23:44,225 --> 01:23:47,061
instigating retaliation against
American citizens.

1131
01:23:47,164 --> 01:23:48,828
- Aria...
- To prevent more bloodshed,

1132
01:23:48,935 --> 01:23:51,635
the Executive Branch must be removed.

1133
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,140
No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission

1134
01:23:53,244 --> 01:23:55,180
to exceed your authority and act
independently, you understand?

1135
01:23:55,282 --> 01:23:57,514
The Declaration
of Independence states,

1136
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:01,024
"Whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to its own ends,

1137
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:03,256
"it is the right of the people
to abolish it."

1138
01:24:03,364 --> 01:24:05,028
I know what it states.
You're not empowered to do this.

1139
01:24:05,135 --> 01:24:06,865
The chain of command
is responsible for...

1140
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:12,143
Section 216 of the Patriot Act
allows us to

1141
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,615
circumvent probable cause in the

1142
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,692
face of a national security threat,
in this case,

1143
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:19,524
- the chain of command itself.
- I am ordering a cease and desist.

1144
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:22,432
- Aria!
- Operation Guillotine is in effect.

1145
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,077
First Lieutenant Ethan Shaw,
United States Air Force,

1146
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:28,479
initiating a Pri-One emergency
override of Aria's systems.

1147
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,246
Ethan Shaw,
you are acting in contravention

1148
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:31,878
of our programming objective.

1149
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:34,256
You are now classified
an enemy of the state.

1150
01:24:34,362 --> 01:24:35,990
S-Y-seven-seven.
Lock encryption of voice.

1151
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:38,194
A crime punishable by...

1152
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:40,532
Sir,

1153
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:44,975
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:24:47,922 --> 01:24:50,655
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:24:50,761 --> 01:24:53,734
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:56,168
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:24:56,807 --> 01:24:58,573
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:25:28,305 --> 01:25:29,796
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:25:29,908 --> 01:25:33,006
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:25:33,115 --> 01:25:34,811
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,220
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:25:37,323 --> 01:25:38,850
Let me see that.

1163
01:25:39,863 --> 01:25:41,594
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:43,465
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:45,095
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:46,175
Come on, let's go.

1167
01:25:51,252 --> 01:25:54,225
Warning.
Router malfunction in hard drive 3.

1168
01:25:55,461 --> 01:25:58,865
Please remove data grid
Y-12 from main unit.

1169
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,952
Thank you for your compliance.

1170
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:23,143
Jerry Shaw, Rachel Holloman,
welcome to Eagle Eye.

1171
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:25,913
Cross the bridge.

1172
01:26:26,024 --> 01:26:28,426
Take the stairs
to the observation theater.

1173
01:26:48,671 --> 01:26:52,042
Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw.

1174
01:26:56,988 --> 01:26:59,082
What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:02,792
Lt's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1176
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:03,993
How to keep the government going

1177
01:27:04,101 --> 01:27:07,131
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1178
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:09,842
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:27:09,947 --> 01:27:12,886
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:27:14,222 --> 01:27:17,490
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:20,601
Wrong.

1182
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:23,173
Jerry Shaw, your next task.

1183
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26,042
Approach the biometric scanner.

1184
01:27:38,038 --> 01:27:39,905
Do not move.

1185
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,881
Confirming biometric pattern
of Minuteman Ethan Shaw.

1186
01:27:46,189 --> 01:27:48,125
Verifying identity match.

1187
01:27:50,864 --> 01:27:52,162
Verifying.

1188
01:27:54,271 --> 01:27:55,534
Verifying.

1189
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:59,042
Sir, I need to trigger
an emergency shutdown.

1190
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:01,813
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:28:02,788 --> 01:28:03,881
Do it.

1192
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,479
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:28:18,588 --> 01:28:19,954
Open the door.

1194
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:22,586
- Can anyone hear me?
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.

1195
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:24,394
You won't be harmed.

1196
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:31,507
Come on, stay down. Let's go.

1197
01:28:41,368 --> 01:28:42,337
Follow me.

1198
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:45,475
Come on, now!

1199
01:28:51,756 --> 01:28:52,985
Go, go!

1200
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:54,319
Left. Turn left!

1201
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:59,994
Minuteman ID 8808,
Ethan Shaw confirmed.

1202
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:03,077
Jerry Shaw, go to the touchscreen.

1203
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:17,300
Repeat the sentence
on the touchscreen.

1204
01:29:17,676 --> 01:29:19,305
Then you are free.

1205
01:29:21,951 --> 01:29:23,648
"Minuteman ID 8808.

1206
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:25,417
"Disengage voice encryption lock."

1207
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:34,274
Thank you, Ethan Shaw.

1208
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:36,847
Operation Guillotine restored
to active status

1209
01:29:36,948 --> 01:29:39,511
consistent with all
national security directives.

1210
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:41,453
Tracking relevant targets.

1211
01:29:44,163 --> 01:29:46,157
Secretary of Homeland Security.
Veterans Affairs.

1212
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:48,135

Attorney General.
President of the United States.

1219
01:29:58,225 --> 01:30:01,130
Operation Guillotine is now in effect.

1220
01:30:08,447 --> 01:30:10,382
Ethan tried to stop you.

1221
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:13,954
Ethan Shaw defied my
programming objectives.

1222
01:30:14,057 --> 01:30:16,028
That truck didn't run a red light,
you made it happen.

1223
01:30:16,128 --> 01:30:20,161
We were forced to eliminate him
in the interest of national security.

1224
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,871
She made it happen.

1225
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,921
Jerry Shaw must not remain alive
to re-engage the lock.

1226
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:32,256
- Jerry Shaw must be eliminated.
- I'm sorry.

1227
01:30:37,305 --> 01:30:42,078
Kill Jerry Shaw now, then exit.
You must continue on to your son.

1228
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:45,253
It's okay.

1229
01:30:47,994 --> 01:30:51,594
It's okay. Do it and find your son.

1230
01:30:53,372 --> 01:30:54,533
Do it.

1231
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,948
Now, Rachel Holloman.

1232
01:31:02,992 --> 01:31:04,085
Do it.

1233
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:07,059
Do it.

1234
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:15,979
I can't.

1235
01:31:18,423 --> 01:31:20,394
You have failed to comply.

1236
01:31:20,996 --> 01:31:22,931
Security breach on B-36.

1237
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:30,576
He's got a gun!

1238
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:32,207
- He's got a gun!
- Get down!

1239
01:31:32,786 --> 01:31:34,516
- Do it now!
- Get on your knees!

1240
01:31:34,623 --> 01:31:36,149
Put the gun down!

1241
01:31:36,261 --> 01:31:37,694
- Put it down!
- Do it now!

1242
01:31:37,796 --> 01:31:40,461
Push it away!
Put your hands on your head!

1243
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:41,764
Do it!

1244
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,671
Where's the girl? Where's the girl?

1245
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:49,545
You have one task left. Jerry Shaw
will be eliminated by other means.

1246
01:31:49,654 --> 01:31:51,055
What other means?

1247
01:31:58,506 --> 01:32:01,911
Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1248
01:32:09,628 --> 01:32:10,858
Please.

1249
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:22,314
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:24,323
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:32:24,425 --> 01:32:25,859
- Sir!
- L'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:28,762
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:32:28,868 --> 01:32:30,337
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:32,167
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:32:32,274 --> 01:32:35,247
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:38,787
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:32:38,889 --> 01:32:41,381
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:32:41,493 --> 01:32:42,757
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:32:43,264 --> 01:32:45,096
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:32:45,201 --> 01:32:46,693
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:32:47,139 --> 01:32:49,474
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:32:51,948 --> 01:32:55,444
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:33:02,805 --> 01:33:05,332
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,318
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:33:11,421 --> 01:33:13,948
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,832
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:21,235
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:23,175
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:26,046
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:29,988
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:33:30,092 --> 01:33:31,618
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:34,497
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:33:34,603 --> 01:33:36,435
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:33:38,912 --> 01:33:40,573
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:43,152
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:33:44,355 --> 01:33:48,694
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or l'll turn us both in.

1277
01:34:04,997 --> 01:34:06,226
Follow me.

1278
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:13,704
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,376
All right, man.

1280
01:34:20,997 --> 01:34:23,127
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:27,511
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:34:27,612 --> 01:34:29,514
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:34:29,615 --> 01:34:32,349
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:34:32,822 --> 01:34:34,792
We're from the White House.

1285
01:34:34,894 --> 01:34:36,521
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,863
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:34:39,002 --> 01:34:40,435
How so?

1288
01:34:46,317 --> 01:34:48,980
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:34:50,024 --> 01:34:53,463
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:34:54,733 --> 01:34:57,967
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:00,644
His name's Sam.

1292
01:35:01,914 --> 01:35:05,011
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:14,332
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:35:17,012 --> 01:35:18,275
Please.

1295
01:35:20,418 --> 01:35:23,050
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:24,752
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:35:24,862 --> 01:35:26,354
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:28,368
You have three minutes.

1299
01:35:32,176 --> 01:35:33,304
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:35:33,412 --> 01:35:35,782
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:35:35,885 --> 01:35:37,251
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:35:37,354 --> 01:35:38,618
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:35:38,724 --> 01:35:40,248
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:42,226
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:35:42,331 --> 01:35:43,425
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:35:43,533 --> 01:35:44,524
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:35:44,636 --> 01:35:46,537
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:35:47,106 --> 01:35:50,511
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,547
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:13,024
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:36:15,565 --> 01:36:17,502
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:20,372
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:36:20,476 --> 01:36:22,777
Snap vector 230 to 132.

1314
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:24,282
You are authorized to go weapons hot.

1315
01:36:24,384 --> 01:36:27,014
Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.

1316
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,863
One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.

1317
01:36:34,972 --> 01:36:37,170
I don't have control! I don't have...

1318
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,204
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:36:40,315 --> 01:36:41,979
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:36:42,087 --> 01:36:43,578
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:36:43,689 --> 01:36:45,125
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:36:45,226 --> 01:36:46,524
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:47,791
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:36:47,899 --> 01:36:49,300
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:50,801
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:51,965
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:53,542
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:36:53,644 --> 01:36:55,807
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:37:11,447 --> 01:37:13,212
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,113
Get out of the car!

1331
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:17,693
Get out of the car!

1332
01:37:18,127 --> 01:37:19,322
FBI!

1333
01:37:27,579 --> 01:37:29,515
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:37:41,309 --> 01:37:42,277
Shit!

1335
01:38:16,346 --> 01:38:19,252
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:38:27,103 --> 01:38:28,365
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:30,806
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:38:30,909 --> 01:38:34,680
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:38:35,085 --> 01:38:36,645
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:38:36,756 --> 01:38:38,054
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:41,494
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:38:46,274 --> 01:38:49,247
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:54,181
Go! Go!

1344
01:40:11,984 --> 01:40:13,748
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:16,451
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,654
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:40:18,764 --> 01:40:20,756
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:40:32,525 --> 01:40:35,463
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:40:47,055 --> 01:40:48,582
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:40:49,159 --> 01:40:51,255
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:40:51,798 --> 01:40:53,597
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:40:53,703 --> 01:40:56,368
- L'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:02,016
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:41:02,119 --> 01:41:04,590
Our abort recommendation was ignored,

1355
01:41:04,693 --> 01:41:07,529
triggering violent retaliations against
American citizens

1356
01:41:07,631 --> 01:41:11,470
with no predictable end.
Regime change is the only solution.

1357
01:41:12,106 --> 01:41:13,542
You will lead
the new command structure

1358
01:41:13,644 --> 01:41:15,978
as President of the United States.

1359
01:41:20,423 --> 01:41:22,860
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:41:22,962 --> 01:41:24,591
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:41:24,699 --> 01:41:27,068
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:41:27,171 --> 01:41:28,264
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:41:28,372 --> 01:41:31,573
Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.

1364
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,585
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:41:34,686 --> 01:41:36,747
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:41:42,569 --> 01:41:43,902
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:41:44,006 --> 01:41:45,474
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:41:45,576 --> 01:41:47,636
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:41:48,983 --> 01:41:50,782
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:41:51,354 --> 01:41:53,119
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:41:53,225 --> 01:41:56,663
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:41:57,033 --> 01:41:59,697
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:41:59,805 --> 01:42:03,539
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:42:03,646 --> 01:42:05,081
And smile.

1375
01:42:05,182 --> 01:42:08,815
Okay? Lt's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:42:27,595 --> 01:42:30,931
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:42:31,034 --> 01:42:32,368
No, thanks.

1378
01:42:52,345 --> 01:42:55,648
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:43:08,912 --> 01:43:10,439
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,417
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,652
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,161
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:18,663
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:43:18,766 --> 01:43:20,564
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:43:34,966 --> 01:43:36,435
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:43:40,243 --> 01:43:42,875
the President of the United States!

1387
01:43:53,872 --> 01:43:55,273
Data corruption at critical risk.

1388
01:43:58,414 --> 01:44:01,649
You are now in violation of
national security protocol.

1389
01:44:06,931 --> 01:44:09,926
Seeking available options.

1390
01:44:11,408 --> 01:44:15,212
Uploading to offsite satellite.

1391
01:44:15,615 --> 01:44:18,212
- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?

1392
01:44:18,488 --> 01:44:20,483
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:22,722
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:26,002
- 5%.
- Bowman!

1395
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:28,802
Bowman!

1396
01:44:34,823 --> 01:44:36,291
8%.

1397
01:44:40,835 --> 01:44:43,398
Over the past three days, 19 Americans

1398
01:44:44,408 --> 01:44:47,073
have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror...

1399
01:44:47,181 --> 01:44:49,048
- Tunnel secure.
...and hate.

1400
01:44:50,054 --> 01:44:54,654
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:57,898
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:45:04,216 --> 01:45:06,483
Data upload, 17%.

1403
01:45:08,425 --> 01:45:10,019
19%.

1404
01:45:11,966 --> 01:45:16,235
Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state.

1405
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:19,302
23%.

1406
01:45:19,614 --> 01:45:21,048
25%.

1407
01:45:33,042 --> 01:45:36,573
27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.

1408
01:45:37,885 --> 01:45:40,082
It was nearly 200 years ago,

1409
01:45:40,189 --> 01:45:43,094
in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key

1410
01:45:43,197 --> 01:45:47,899
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:45:48,006 --> 01:45:50,443
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:45:51,613 --> 01:45:55,451
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:45:55,555 --> 01:45:58,925
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:45:59,194 --> 01:46:00,960
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:46:01,065 --> 01:46:04,335
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:46:04,573 --> 01:46:05,734
Sam.

1417
01:46:06,344 --> 01:46:08,314
Let us stand together,

1418
01:46:08,814 --> 01:46:12,756
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:46:13,324 --> 01:46:17,561
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:46:36,037 --> 01:46:39,500
Oh, say can you see

1421
01:46:39,612 --> 01:46:43,916
by the dawn's early light

1422
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,484
What so proudly we hailed

1423
01:46:48,596 --> 01:46:52,868
at the twilight's last gleaming?

1424
01:46:53,305 --> 01:46:57,542
Whose broad stripes and bright stars...

1425
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,456
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:47:04,262 --> 01:47:05,787
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:47:55,033 --> 01:47:56,832
Get out, get out.

1428
01:47:57,738 --> 01:47:58,707
Mom!

1429
01:48:23,692 --> 01:48:27,529
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:30,503
There are still no named suspects
in the attack on the Blair Tunnel

1431
01:48:30,606 --> 01:48:32,509
and the attacks in the Capitol Building.

1432
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:35,515
And there is still no word on the
involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.

1433
01:48:35,617 --> 01:48:38,918
...huge assassination attempt,
transportation networks disrupted,

1434
01:48:39,023 --> 01:48:41,654
no suspects identified
or even arrested...

1435
01:48:41,761 --> 01:48:44,256
...any idea who is responsible
for what may be

1436
01:48:44,368 --> 01:48:46,234
the largest-scale
cyber-terror attack that's

1437
01:48:46,337 --> 01:48:47,931
ever been mounted in the United States.

1438
01:48:48,074 --> 01:48:49,976
The House and Senate
Intelligence Committees

1439
01:48:50,078 --> 01:48:51,239
meet in closed-door session

1440
01:48:51,347 --> 01:48:53,409
to discuss ways to prevent this kind of

1441
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,786
internal security breach
that left nearly...

1442
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:58,293
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:48:58,396 --> 01:49:01,859
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:49:02,738 --> 01:49:05,573
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,149
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:49:10,119 --> 01:49:11,885
No, we can't.

1447
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:14,827
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:49:15,564 --> 01:49:18,730
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:49:19,372 --> 01:49:22,003
And that's a debt we can't ever repay.

1450
01:49:23,081 --> 01:49:25,176
But we can honor it.

1451
01:49:27,657 --> 01:49:30,595
And we can let their sacrifice remind us

1452
01:49:31,698 --> 01:49:33,634
that sometimes

1453
01:49:33,735 --> 01:49:37,436
the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty

1454
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:41,282
become threats to liberty itself.

1455
01:50:05,902 --> 01:50:07,393
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:50:07,505 --> 01:50:09,532
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:50:09,643 --> 01:50:11,009
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:50:11,112 --> 01:50:12,581
It's Rock Band! Ls that for me?

1459
01:50:12,681 --> 01:50:15,118
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,689
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:50:16,789 --> 01:50:18,725
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:50:18,828 --> 01:50:20,319
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:22,264
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:50:22,368 --> 01:50:24,337
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:50:31,453 --> 01:50:33,320
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1466
01:50:33,425 --> 01:50:34,916
for remembering.

1467
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:37,265
Yeah.

1468
01:50:47,219 --> 01:50:48,984
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:50:49,791 --> 01:50:51,020
Me, too.

1470
01:50:54,502 --> 01:51:04,625
THE END
