<i>Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?</i>

3
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
<i>Like you had something unique
to offer the world...</i>

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>...if you could just get people
to see it.</i>

5
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
<i>Then you know exactly how it felt...</i>

6
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
<i>...to be me.</i>

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
<i>Go ahead, Flint.</i>

8
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
<i>What is the number one problem
facing our community today?</i>

9
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
<i>Untied shoelaces.</i>

10
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
<i>Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.</i>

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
<i>Spray-On Shoes.</i>

12
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
<i>- Voilà.
- They're so nifty.</i>

13
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
<i>How you gonna get them off, nerd?</i>

14
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
<i>What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.</i>

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
<i>I wanted to run away that day.</i>

16
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
<i>But you can't run away
from your own feet.</i>

17
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
<i>Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.</i>

18
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
<i>I don't understand
fishing metaphors.</i>

19
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
<i>- What did I say?
- Don't worry.</i>

20
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
<i>Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.</i>

21
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
<i>Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.</i>

22
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
<i>So?</i>

23
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
<i>People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.</i>

24
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
<i>But that never stopped them.</i>

25
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
<i>I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.</i>

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
<i>A professional-grade lab coat.</i>

27
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
<i>Just like the real guys wear.</i>

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
<i>It fits perfect.</i>

29
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
<i>The world needs
your originality, Flint.</i>

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
<i>You just have to grow into it.</i>

31
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
<i>And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.</i>

32
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
<i>From that moment on...</i>

33
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
<i>...I was determined
to invent something great.</i>

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
<i>Remote Control Television.</i>

35
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
<i>And, the pitch is in.</i>

36
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
<i>Eventually.</i>

37
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604

<i>Monkey Thought Translator.</i>

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
<i>- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.</i>

41
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
<i>No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it-</i>

42
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
<i>Ratbirds.</i>

43
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
<i>Hey, what's going on, little guy?</i>

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
<i>Flint Lockwood.</i>

45
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
<i>My dream was to help
my hometown...</i>

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
<i>...a tiny island hidden under
the "A" in "Atlantic"...</i>

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
<i>...called Swallow Falls.</i>

48
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
<i>We were famous for sardines...</i>

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
<i>...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.</i>

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
<i>Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...</i>

51
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
<i>...are super gross.</i>

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
<i>Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.</i>

53
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
<i>Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.</i>

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
<i>Life became gray and flavourless.</i>

55
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
<i>But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...</i>

56
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
<i>...and found hope.</i>

57
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,055
<i>My name is Flint Lockwood.</i>

58
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,491
<i>And I was about to invent
a machine...</i>

59
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,490
<i>...that turns water...</i>

60
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,822
<i>...into food.</i>

61
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,724
<i>Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.</i>

62
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,159
<i>Steve.</i>

63
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:28,067
<i>Can I count on your help?</i>

64
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,499
<i>Can.</i>

65
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,436
<i>I knew I could.</i>

66
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,173
<i>Button, on.
Memory, activate.</i>

67
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,217
<i>Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.</i>

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,981
<i>Radiation matrix, secure.</i>

69
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,148
<i>Computer, boot.</i>

70
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,987
<i>Coolness enhancement, complete.</i>

71
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,992
<i>Engage coffee break.</i>

72
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,361
<i>Networking power grid.</i>

73
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,369
<i>Beginning conversion of water...</i>

74
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,207
<i>...into food.</i>

75
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,441
<i>Hydrating protein matrix.</i>

76
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,545

<i>Uploading cool machine voice.</i>

79
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,153
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

80
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:30,090
<i>Everyone is going to love this.</i>

81
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,122
<i>Flint!</i>

82
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,762
<i>Sorry, Dad.</i>

83
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,198
<i>Steve, keep working.</i>

84
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,934
<i>Scanning hand.</i>

85
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,016
<i>That's a really weird dude.</i>

86
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,158
<i>Re-energizing tower unit.</i>

87
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,363
<i>Jeez. See you, Dad.</i>

88
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:44,598
<i>Flint.</i>

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,876
<i>Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?</i>

90
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,542
<i>No, why?</i>

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,157
<i>Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.</i>

92
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,192
<i>The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.</i>

93
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,023
<i>But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.</i>

94
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,028
<i>Billy, just play dead.</i>

95
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,431
<i>Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.</i>

96
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,367
<i>- What?
- I want you to work full-time...</i>

97
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,235
<i>...at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.</i>

98
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,000
<i>Tackle is a good career.</i>

99
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,804
<i>Please, I'm so close with this one.</i>

100
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,109
<i>I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.</i>

101
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,308
<i>And then you could sell food
in the shop...</i>

102
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:30,249
<i>...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.</i>

103
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,016
<i>It is going to be so awesome.</i>

104
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,785
<i>I'm sorry, son.</i>

105
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,087
<i>No more inventing.</i>

106
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,391
<i>Dad, I know I can do this.</i>

107
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,760
<i>And Mom did too.</i>

108
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,564
<i>It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...</i>

109
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.</i>

110
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>Come on. Let's open the shop.</i>

111
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,350
<i>Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.</i>

112
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,618
<i>You feeling it?</i>

113
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,960
<i>Look out, Baby Brent!</i>

114
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,421
<i>Baby Brent Sardines.</i>

115
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,227
<i>Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.</i>

116
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:22,203
<i>As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...</i>

117
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,671
<i>...and look to the future.</i>

118
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,902
<i>Sardine tourism!</i>

119
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,338
<i>That's why,
without consulting anyone...</i>

120
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:34,144
<i>...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...</i>

121
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,787
<i>...which I will be unveiling today...</i>

122
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,786
<i>...at noon.</i>

123
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:43,587
<i>Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.</i>

124
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:47,060
<i>What is up, everybody?</i>

125
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,166
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.</i>

126
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:53,395
<i>What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?</i>

127
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,272
<i>Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...</i>

128
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,035
<i>...at the mayor's unveiling thing?</i>

129
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,942
<i>I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.</i>

130
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,350
<i>All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.</i>

131
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,354
<i>- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.</i>

132
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:17,358
<i>Listen, you- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?</i>

133
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,487
<i>You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.</i>

134
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,567
<i>Really? You sure you can handle it?</i>

135
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,068
<i>Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.</i>

136
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,799
<i>All right, then.</i>

137
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,908
<i>I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.</i>

138
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,271
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

139
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,987
<i>This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.</i>

140
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,056
<i>I wanna be big.</i>

141
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:51,685
<i>I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."</i>

142
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,728
<i>And that's why this has to work.</i>

143
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,559
<i>It has to work.</i>

144
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,896
<i>Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...</i>

145
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,437
<i>...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.</i>

146
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,074
<i>But not me, right?</i>

147
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:08,736
<i>Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.</i>

148
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,579
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,551
<i>Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.</i>

150
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,319
<i>We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.</i>

151
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,395
<i>- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.</i>

152
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,595
<i>What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?</i>

153
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,292
<i>Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.</i>

154
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,404
<i>- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.</i>

155
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,403
<i>A shenaniganizer.</i>

156
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,939
<i>A tomfool.</i>

157
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,373
<i>- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?</i>

158
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,036
<i>I love him so much.
This is my only son.</i>

159
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,841
<i>I want him to have a bright future.</i>

160
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,280
<i>A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...</i>

161
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:49,682
<i>...with one of your
crazy science thingies.</i>

162
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:53,017
<i>- Well, that's all behind me-
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?</i>

163
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,250
<i>- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.</i>

164
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,656
<i>- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.</i>

165
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,562
<i>I got my eye on you.</i>

166
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,999
<i>- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.</i>

167
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,607
<i>And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...</i>

168
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:14,336
<i>...and their most experienced
professional reporter.</i>

169
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:18,546
<i>Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.</i>

170
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:22,948
<i>Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.</i>

171
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,318
<i>How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...</i>

172
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,982
<i>...in the middle of the ocean
as a favour to my cousin?</i>

173
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,218
<i>Really?</i>

174
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,261
<i>Can you believe it, Manny?</i>

175
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,991
<i>Temporary
professional meteorologist.</i>

176
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,725
<i>Okay, Manny, what about this?</i>

177
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,733
<i>Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.</i>

178
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:42,270
<i>Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.</i>

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,499
<i>America, hi. I didn't see you there.</i>

180
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,040
<i>It's me, Sam Sparks.</i>

181
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,579
<i>On my way across the ocean.</i>

182
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:55,712
<i>Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.</i>

183
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,548
<i>Act like, "Hey, whoa."</i>

184
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,555
<i>This is a great idea.</i>

185
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,750
<i>Weather News Network.</i>

186
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,555
<i>Weather news happens...</i>

187
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,061
<i>...or not.</i>

188
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,823
<i>Now we're over to Swallow Falls...</i>

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,332
<i>...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.</i>

190
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,164
<i>Or should I say, first gray on the job.</i>

191
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,930
<i>Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.</i>

192
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,041
<i>Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.</i>

193
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:23,479
<i>It's Swallow Falls degrees and-
Well, let's just go to the mayor.</i>

194
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,948
<i>Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.</i>

195
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,715
<i>You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...</i>

196
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,460
<i>And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...</i>

197
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,829
<i>...Swallow Falls' favourite son,
Baby Brent!</i>

198
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,367
<i>He's still got it, folks.</i>

199
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,663
<i>Yeah.</i>

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,336
<i>I'm the best person
in the whole town.</i>

201
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,618
<i>Food synthesis, go.</i>

202
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:07,623
<i>My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.</i>

203
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:13,659
<i>Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:</i>

204
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:15,958
<i>Sardine Land.</i>

205
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:20,329
<i>With rides and exhibits.</i>

206
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,566
<i>And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...</i>

207
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:27,973
<i>...and his flaming hoop of glory.</i>

208
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,838
<i>Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.</i>

209
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,142
<i>Yeah.</i>

210
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,022
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

211
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,251
<i>Flint Lockwood.</i>

212
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,658
<i>Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a-</i>

213
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:01,371
<i>Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For-</i>

214
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,309
<i>What just happened to me?</i>

215
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,641
<i>Sorry.</i>

216
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,035
<i>No.</i>

217
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,668
<i>You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.</i>

218
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:35,278
<i>Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.</i>

219
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,209
<i>Come on.</i>

220
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,253
<i>I really shouldn't be running
with these.</i>

221
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:00,364
<i>Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.</i>

222
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,653
<i>- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!</i>

223
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,027
<i>I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.</i>

224
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,528
<i>Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?</i>

225
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,693
<i>- I didn't get a chance to-
- It's okay, it's just pain.</i>

226
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,462
<i>Sorry, I'm not myself today.</i>

227
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:46,576
<i>My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.</i>

228
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,339
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

229
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,981
<i>What is going on with your feet?</i>

230
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,879
<i>Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.</i>

231
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,417
<i>Cool.</i>

232
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:59,313
<i>This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.</i>

233
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,550
<i>What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?</i>

234
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

235
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,352
<i>Exactly.</i>

236
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,258
<i>I mean...</i>

237
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:11,065
<i>Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.</i>

238
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,230
<i>- Flint.
- Steve.</i>

239
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,398
<i>- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.</i>

240
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:22,109
<i>Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?</i>

241
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:25,243
<i>- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.</i>

242
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,509
<i>I said I was sorry.</i>

243
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,686
<i>Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?</i>

244
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,553
<i>I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.</i>

245
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,454
<i>You get one shot at the show.</i>

246
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,722
<i>And if you don't make it...</i>

247
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,390
<i>...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.</i>

248
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,136
<i>Cheese?</i>

249
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,312
<i>But that could only mean...</i>

250
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,333
<i>Excited. Excited.</i>

251
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,110
<i>My machine works.</i>

252
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:09,146
<i>It really works!</i>

253
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,679
<i>Your machine?</i>

254
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,553
<i>Is that what that rocket was?</i>

255
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,688
<i>Do you like it?</i>

256
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,120
<i>I love it!</i>

257
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,032
<i>This is just amazing.
Look at this.</i>

258
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,998
<i>This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.</i>

259
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,138
<i>Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?</i>

260
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,009
<i>Manny, get your camera.</i>

261
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:53,029
<i>This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.</i>

262
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,496
<i>Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...</i>

263
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:01,104
<i>...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.</i>

264
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,899
<i>You may have seen
a meteor shower...</i>

265
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,873
<i>...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.</i>

266
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:11,174
<i>For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.</i>

267
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:14,340
<i>This tastes significantly better
than sardines.</i>

268
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,020
<i>This is going to be big.</i>

269
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:26,287
<i>This food weather
was created intentionally...</i>

270
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:29,660
<i>...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.</i>

271
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,824
<i>Flint Lockwood?</i>

272
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,026
<i>Hi.</i>

273
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,262
<i>You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.</i>

274
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,031
<i>Flint, those burgers were awesome.</i>

275
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,574
<i>The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."</i>

276
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,938
<i>- Food weather.
- What?</i>

277
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,909
<i>This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.</i>

278
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,844
<i>- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.</i>

279
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,211
<i>- I don't know if I-
- You're gonna do it again?</i>

280
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,716
<i>You gotta be kidding.</i>

281
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,082
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

282
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,789
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>

283
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:59,657
<i>- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.</i>

284
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,957
<i>- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...</i>

285
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,724
<i>...that's not natural.</i>

286
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,563
<i>My invention could save
the whole town.</i>

287
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,331
<i>You will be so proud of me, Dad.</i>

288
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,303
<i>Plus...</i>

289
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:12,840
<i>...there's a girl here.</i>

290
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:19,104
<i>Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...</i>

291
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,308
<i>...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?</i>

292
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,448
<i>Yes.</i>

293
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:41,129
<i>I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.</i>

294
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,466
<i>- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.</i>

295
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,874
<i>- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...</i>

296
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,142
<i>...this is where the magic happens.</i>

297
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:57,818
<i>Lick. Lick. Lick.</i>

298
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,219
<i>Lick. Lick. Lick.</i>

299
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,126
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>

300
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,057
<i>You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.</i>

301
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,666
<i>What?</i>

302
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,567
<i>So here's how it works.</i>

303
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:18,731
<i>Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.</i>

304
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,774
<i>When you shot it
into the stratosphere...</i>

305
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:24,675
<i>...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?</i>

306
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,840
<i>That's actually
a really smart observation.</i>

307
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,713
<i>I mean...</i>

308
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:32,955
<i>The clouds probably have water
in them...</i>

309
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,524
<i>...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.</i>

310
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,821
<i>Right, right. That's why I did that.</i>

311
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,987
<i>- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.</i>

312
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,894
<i>- Right.
- Of course.</i>

313
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:45,993
<i>Okay.</i>

314
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,264
<i>The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.</i>

315
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,432
<i>Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...</i>

316
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,067
<i>...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.</i>

317
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,406
<i>So...</i>

318
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:58,605
<i>- Pizza?
- Yes.</i>

319
00:23:58,782 --> 00:23:59,908
<i>- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.</i>

320
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,551
<i>- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.</i>

321
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,947
<i>- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.</i>

322
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,553
<i>- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.</i>

323
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,883
<i>- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?</i>

324
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,719
<i>Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.</i>

325
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:12,191
<i>- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.</i>

326
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:14,626
<i>- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?</i>

327
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,265
<i>I love Jell-O.</i>

328
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,833
<i>I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?</i>

329
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,402
<i>Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.</i>

330
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:22,596
<i>Hey, me too.</i>

331
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,365
<i>- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.</i>

332
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,599
<i>- No, the machine.
- Of course.</i>

333
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:28,974
<i>It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...</i>

334
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,273
<i>...Dynamic Food Replicator.</i>

335
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,109
<i>Or, for short:</i>

336
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,046
<i>The FLDSMDFR.</i>

337
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,644
<i>Fliminadifiser?</i>

338
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,151
<i>FLDSMDFR.</i>

339
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,721
<i>Fliminubahdibferer?</i>

340
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,517
<i>Fli.</i>

341
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,455
<i>Suh.</i>

342
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,989
<i>Fdiferf.</i>

343
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,231
<i>Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.</i>

344
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,423
<i>Now?</i>

345
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,332
<i>Well, the thing is, I can't...</i>

346
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,565
<i>...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.</i>

347
00:24:58,675 --> 00:24:59,699
<i>What?</i>

348
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:01,105
<i>Fight the power!</i>

349
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,246
<i>What is this?</i>

350
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:09,015
<i>It's so cute.</i>

351
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,017
<i>Pushing. Folding. Connecting.</i>

352
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,986
<i>Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.</i>

353
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:15,284
<i>Staring.</i>

354
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,824
<i>Motivating.</i>

355
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,519
<i>- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...</i>

356
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,755
<i>...for three hours.
- I know.</i>

357
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,202
<i>It's working.</i>

358
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,367
<i>What do you guys want for breakfast?</i>

359
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:36,536
<i>- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.</i>

360
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,874
<i>We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.</i>

361
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,448
<i>How about...</i>

362
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,175
<i>...eggs.
- And toast.</i>

363
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,649
<i>Orange juice.</i>

364
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,516
<i>- And bacon.
- Bacon.</i>

365
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:47,854
<i>What are you doing?</i>

366
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,458
<i>Nothing.</i>

367
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:50,650
<i>To the computer.</i>

368
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,033
<i>So you're sure this is safe?</i>

369
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,060
<i>Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...</i>

370
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,001
<i>...if the food is going
to over-mutate.</i>

371
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,073
<i>What happens
if the food over-mutates?</i>

372
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,642
<i>I don't know.
But that'll never happen.</i>

373
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,177
<i>All right, this probably
won't explode.</i>

374
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:11,371
<i>What?</i>

375
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,749
<i>Bacon.</i>

376
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,423
<i>Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...</i>

377
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,363
<i>...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.</i>

378
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:32,729
<i>My forecast?</i>

379
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,837
<i>Sunny side up.</i>

380
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,680
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

381
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,591
<i>Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?</i>

382
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,091
<i>All right, here's the skinny:</i>

383
00:26:58,262 --> 00:27:01,129
<i>You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...</i>

384
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:03,266
<i>...weathergirl provides
free advertising...</i>

385
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,628
<i>...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...</i>

386
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,862
<i>...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.</i>

387
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,440
<i>All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...</i>

388
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,577
<i>...every day
for the foreseeable future...</i>

389
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:17,509
<i>...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...</i>

390
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:20,479
<i>...as a must-see cruise destination.</i>

391
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,279
<i>And everyone, everywhere...</i>

392
00:27:23,453 --> 00:27:27,787
<i>...is going to love your invention.</i>

393
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:29,455
<i>Do you think so?</i>

394
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,060
<i>I know so.</i>

395
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,425
<i>Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.</i>

396
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,906
<i>Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?</i>

397
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,413
<i>- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.</i>

398
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,948
<i>- Avocado.
- Coming right up.</i>

399
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,015
<i>Leftovers?</i>

400
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:02,556
<i>Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...</i>

401
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,627
<i>...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...</i>

402
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,287
<i>...and therefore, out of mind.</i>

403
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,669
<i>Jellybeans!</i>

404
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:19,866
<i>Awesome.</i>

405
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:22,341
<i>- BLT.
- Doughnuts.</i>

406
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,545
<i>Pie.</i>

407
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,739
<i>Gummi bears.</i>

408
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:28,213
<i>- Fish.
- Crème brûlée!</i>

409
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,554
<i>A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...</i>

410
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:35,521
<i>...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.</i>

411
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,091
<i>It's me, the mayor.</i>

412
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,060
<i>You look different.</i>

413
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,993
<i>Did you get a new haircut?</i>

414
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:44,190
<i>Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.</i>

415
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,800
<i>- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.</i>

416
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,741
<i>I love spending time with you, Dad.</i>

417
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,646
<i>Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.</i>

418
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,654
<i>If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.</i>

419
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,648
<i>No, thanks.</i>

420
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:14,957
<i>That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.</i>

421
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,997
<i>Got it.</i>

422
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,335
<i>Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.</i>

423
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:24,167
<i>I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.</i>

424
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,504
<i>I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.</i>

425
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,941
<i>Right. Got it.</i>

426
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,985
<i>Flint Lockwood?</i>

427
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,250
<i>Yeah?</i>

428
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,990
<i>It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...</i>

429
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:48,563
<i>...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.</i>

430
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:51,132
<i>Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.</i>

431
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,962
<i>Plus, you're always mean to me.</i>

432
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:54,967
<i>It'll be just one time...</i>

433
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,606
<i>...for my special angel's special day.</i>

434
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,240
<i>I don't know.</i>

435
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,709
<i>You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...</i>

436
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,372
<i>Okay. I knew it was a long shot.</i>

437
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,281
<i>I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.</i>

438
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,217
<i>I thought you would understand.</i>

439
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,387
<i>You know how fathers always trying
to express...</i>

440
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,224
<i>...their love and appreciation
for their sons.</i>

441
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,126
<i>Earl, wait.</i>

442
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,775
<i>Touch. Touch. Touch.</i>

443
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,146
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

444
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,138
<i>Happy birthday, son.</i>

445
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,466
<i>Dad?</i>

446
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,973
<i>This is your day. Go have fun.</i>

447
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:10,705
<i>- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.</i>

448
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:14,476
<i>- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!</i>

449
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,446
<i>Yeah! Cool.</i>

450
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,785
<i>Strawberry's my favourite.</i>

451
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,062
<i>Come on, Dad.</i>

452
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,729
<i>I don't know, Cal.</i>

453
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,274
<i>This doesn't look safe!</i>

454
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,311
<i>I love you, son.</i>

455
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:52,649
<i>I know, Dad. You tell me every day.</i>

456
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,523
<i>Flint, this is amazing.</i>

457
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:01,289
<i>And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...</i>

458
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,364
<i>...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.</i>

459
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,400
<i>Maybe with hot fudge.</i>

460
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:09,664
<i>Hey, Flint.</i>

461
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,864
<i>You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?</i>

462
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,002
<i>Flint, what's the problem?</i>

463
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,373
<i>I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.</i>

464
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,777
<i>- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.</i>

465
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,579
<i>Is there like a point system or is it...</i>

466
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,618
<i>...to the death?
- No-</i>

467
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,817
<i>You've nev-? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.</i>

468
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:38,968
<i>So like this?</i>

469
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:41,697
<i>No, harder than that.</i>

470
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,701
<i>Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.</i>

471
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,202
<i>Snowball. Snowball.</i>

472
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,372
<i>Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.</i>

473
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,542
<i>Snowball!</i>

474
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:57,644
<i>Snowball!</i>

475
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,757
<i>Snowball and snowball.</i>

476
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:03,984
<i>Kids? What's going on?</i>

477
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,253
<i>Snowball.</i>

478
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,328
<i>- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.</i>

479
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:10,830
<i>I scream, you scream...</i>

480
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:15,301
<i>...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...</i>

481
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,532
<i>...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...</i>

482
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,141
<i>...an ice cream snow day.</i>

483
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,837
<i>He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...</i>

484
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,641
<i>...and come on down
this Saturday...</i>

485
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,306
<i>...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...</i>

486
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,648
<i>...a town that is truly à la mode.</i>

487
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,422
<i>A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.</i>

488
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,534
<i>With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...</i>

489
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:48,068
<i>...I'm Sam Sparks.</i>

490
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:51,969
<i>Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.</i>

491
00:33:58,515 --> 00:33:59,539
<i>That's it!</i>

492
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,445
<i>Researching. Role-playing.</i>

493
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,017
<i>Dialing.</i>

494
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,813
<i>Waiting.</i>

495
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,957
<i>- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.</i>

496
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,355
<i>Regretting. Re-psyching.</i>

497
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:13,393
<i>Saying what I'm doing.</i>

498
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,588
<i>- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.</i>

499
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,029
<i>I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da-"</i>

500
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,532
<i>Activity with me tomorrow.</i>

501
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,038
<i>- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.</i>

502
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,641
<i>Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.</i>

503
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,870
<i>Keep an eye on the lab for me.</i>

504
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,780
<i>Steve.</i>

505
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,912
<i>Foster still at the plate.</i>

506
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,020
<i>And nobody out.</i>

507
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,655
<i>Where are we going?</i>

508
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,053
<i>Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...</i>

509
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:46,286
<i>...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.</i>

510
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,489
<i>Like you do as friends.</i>

511
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,993
<i>Oh, my, what's that?</i>

512
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:03,739
<i>Jell-O's my favourite.</i>

513
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,712
<i>You never made a request, so...</i>

514
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,714
<i>...I made one for you.</i>

515
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:13,385
<i>Flint?</i>

516
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,921
<i>Flint?</i>

517
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,952
<i>Join me.</i>

518
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:31,799
<i>But how did you-?</i>

519
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,172
<i>I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...</i>

520
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,472
<i>...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...</i>

521
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:41,208
<i>...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.</i>

522
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,417
<i>Everything's made of Jell-O.</i>

523
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,078
<i>This piano, those sconces...</i>

524
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,725
<i>...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...</i>

525
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:51,986
<i>...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...</i>

526
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:55,097
<i>...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.</i>

527
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,096
<i>Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?</i>

528
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,568
<i>Nothing!</i>

529
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:06,332
<i>Yeah.</i>

530
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:21,084
<i>Cannonball.</i>

531
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:23,959
<i>Belly flop.</i>

532
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,588
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

533
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,074
<i>- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.</i>

534
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,710
<i>It's a solid, it's a liquid...</i>

535
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:46,372
<i>...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.</i>

536
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,210
<i>I mean...</i>

537
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,443
<i>...it tastes good.</i>

538
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,554
<i>- Why do you do that?
- Do what?</i>

539
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:56,852
<i>Say something super smart
and then bail from it.</i>

540
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,653
<i>Can you keep a secret?</i>

541
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,592
<i>No.</i>

542
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:05,056
<i>But this time, sure, yeah.</i>

543
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:12,163
<i>Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...</i>

544
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,068
<i>...a nerd.</i>

545
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:16,702
<i>Too?</i>

546
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,246
<i>When I was a little girl...</i>

547
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,009
<i>...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...</i>

548
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,882
<i>...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.</i>

549
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,282
<i>Other girls wanted a Barbie.</i>

550
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,328
<i>I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.</i>

551
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:37,466
<i>But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.</i>

552
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,658
<i>It wasn't even clever.</i>

553
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,769
<i>Four-eyes, four-eyes</i>

554
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:42,996
<i>You need glasses to see</i>

555
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,399
<i>Go on.</i>

556
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,609
<i>So I got a new look...</i>

557
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,270
<i>...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...</i>

558
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,575
<i>...and I was never
made fun of again.</i>

559
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,778
<i>And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.</i>

560
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:01,446
<i>- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not-</i>

561
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,114
<i>And on they go.</i>

562
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,120
<i>- What?
- Nothing.</i>

563
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:09,788
<i>Wait.</i>

564
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,134
<i>It's a Jell-O scrunchie.</i>

565
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:22,008
<i>And now, the reveal.</i>

566
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,539
<i>Wow.</i>

567
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,412
<i>I mean, you were okay before...</i>

568
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,487
<i>...but now...</i>

569
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:35,117
<i>...you're beautiful.</i>

570
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,987
<i>No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.</i>

571
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:40,994
<i>Well, why not?</i>

572
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:44,224
<i>I mean, this is the real you, right?</i>

573
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,260
<i>Smart.</i>

574
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:49,405
<i>Bespectacled.</i>

575
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,974
<i>Who wouldn't wanna see that?</i>

576
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:56,737
<i>You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.</i>

577
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,676
<i>Me either.</i>

578
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,975
<i>But about you.</i>

579
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,696
<i>Flint, you have a call</i>

580
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:21,769
<i>Flint, you have a call</i>

581
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:23,701
<i>Is your phone ringing?</i>

582
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,899
<i>That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.</i>

583
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,203
<i>Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?</i>

584
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,403
<i>No, no, no.</i>

585
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,344
<i>- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.</i>

586
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:36,917
<i>- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.</i>

587
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,423
<i>Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.</i>

588
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,625
<i>- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.</i>

589
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,300
<i>Dad, I almost kissed a girl.</i>

590
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:58,167
<i>- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing- Hi.</i>

591
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,841
<i>- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.</i>

592
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:07,142
<i>What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.</i>

593
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,049
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

594
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:14,122
<i>Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.</i>

595
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,589
<i>A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.</i>

596
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,695
<i>- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.</i>

597
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,763
<i>Oh, wow. Thank you.</i>

598
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:25,833
<i>- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.</i>

599
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,605
<i>So no roof.</i>

600
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,073
<i>Yep. You just hold out your plate.</i>

601
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,235
<i>And I even made it rain
your favourite:</i>

602
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,437
<i>Meat.</i>

603
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,879
<i>Okay.</i>

604
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:51,015
<i>So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?</i>

605
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:56,427
<i>Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.</i>

606
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,965
<i>He said my invention
saved the town.</i>

607
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:01,734
<i>Aren't you proud of me?</i>

608
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,339
<i>Well...</i>

609
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,413
<i>...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?</i>

610
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,752
<i>Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.</i>

611
00:41:21,924 --> 00:41:24,415
<i>Did you even hear what I just said?</i>

612
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,626
<i>Son, look around.</i>

613
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:30,322
<i>I'm not sure this is good for people.</i>

614
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,301
<i>Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.</i>

615
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,234
<i>It's making everybody happy.</i>

616
00:41:37,473 --> 00:41:39,338
<i>Everybody except you.</i>

617
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,273
<i>When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...</i>

618
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:46,541
<i>...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?</i>

619
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,743
<i>Well...</i>

620
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,787
<i>...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.</i>

621
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,351
<i>I guess I'll just get out of your way.</i>

622
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,649
<i>Get with the times, man.</i>

623
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,485
<i>I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.</i>

624
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,755
<i>He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.</i>

625
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,973
<i>These are big hot dogs.</i>

626
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,843
<i>Man.</i>

627
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,888
<i>I mean, this isn't that bad.</i>

628
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,854
<i>- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.</i>

629
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,151
<i>You're right, Steve.</i>

630
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,126
<i>The Dangeometer is in the yellow.</i>

631
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,661
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

632
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,423
<i>I do...</i>

633
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,727
<i>...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!</i>

634
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,498
<i>Oh, no.</i>

635
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,771
<i>How did you get in here?</i>

636
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,772
<i>Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.</i>

637
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,711
<i>The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.</i>

638
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:26,007
<i>I'm thinking pasta.</i>

639
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:30,909
<i>Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.</i>

640
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,923
<i>Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.</i>

641
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:37,354
<i>What?</i>

642
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,696
<i>This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.</i>

643
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,725
<i>And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.</i>

644
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:48,899
<i>The machine uses
microwave radiation...</i>

645
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,301
<i>...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.</i>

646
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,136
<i>The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...</i>

647
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,303
<i>...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.</i>

648
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:01,715
<i>I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.</i>

649
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,549
<i>Here's what I heard:</i>

650
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,915
<i>"Science, science, science, bigger."</i>

651
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,750
<i>And bigger is better.</i>

652
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,520
<i>Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.</i>

653
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:14,927
<i>I know I do.</i>

654
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,598
<i>My dad thinks I should turn it off.</i>

655
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:24,001
<i>Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.</i>

656
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:25,265
<i>But what if things go-</i>

657
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,671
<i>Who needs the approval
of one family member...</i>

658
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:30,710
<i>...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?</i>

659
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,407
<i>Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.</i>

660
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,141
<i>And me.</i>

661
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,380
<i>I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.</i>

662
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,516
<i>And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...</i>

663
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,185
<i>...save the town...</i>

664
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:51,959
<i>...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.</i>

665
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,659
<i>So here's the cheese:</i>

666
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:56,805
<i>You can keep it going...</i>

667
00:44:56,973 --> 00:44:58,941
<i>...get everything
you've ever wanted...</i>

668
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,407
<i>...and be the great man
I know you can be.</i>

669
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,342
<i>Or you can turn it off...</i>

670
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,277
<i>...ruin everything...</i>

671
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,113
<i>...and no one will ever like you.</i>

672
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:13,618
<i>It's your choice.</i>

673
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,086
<i>Choice.</i>

674
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,690
<i>Choice.</i>

675
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:17,883
<i>Choice.</i>

676
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,357
<i>Choice.</i>

677
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:21,428
<i>Choice.</i>

678
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,190
<i>Okay.</i>

679
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:39,075
<i>I mean, bigger is better...</i>

680
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,272
<i>...right?</i>

681
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,542
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

682
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:50,255
<i>Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.</i>

683
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:05,970
<i>- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.</i>

684
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,871
<i>Who's hungry?</i>

685
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:47,607
<i>Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.</i>

686
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:49,307
<i>That is one big mayor.</i>

687
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,943
<i>Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.</i>

688
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:57,182
<i>Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...</i>

689
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,089
<i>...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!</i>

690
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:02,287
<i>I've got jellybeans for teeth.</i>

691
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:04,330
<i>And when the fun is done...</i>

692
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,436
<i>...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.</i>

693
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:12,404
<i>From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.</i>

694
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:16,642
<i>We've got people here today
from all around the world...</i>

695
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:19,042
<i>...from as far as China
to West Virginia.</i>

696
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,080
<i>Also I think there's
some Canadians here.</i>

697
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,514
<i>- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?</i>

698
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:25,551
<i>You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.</i>

699
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,053
<i>There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.</i>

700
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,193
<i>I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.</i>

701
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,692
<i>I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.</i>

702
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:36,263
<i>What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?</i>

703
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:40,368
<i>For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.</i>

704
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:42,731
<i>Why can't you just be
happy for me...</i>

705
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,430
<i>...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.</i>

706
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,973
<i>And without further ado...</i>

707
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:51,079
<i>...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...</i>

708
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,647
<i>...Flint Lockwood.</i>

709
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,147
<i>Yeah, Flint.</i>

710
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,342
<i>Thank you. Thank you, everyone.</i>

711
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,147
<i>- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.</i>

712
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:01,221
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.</i>

713
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,885
<i>I admire your quirkiness, dude.</i>

714
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:07,688
<i>Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.</i>

715
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:09,764
<i>But-</i>

716
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:11,023
<i>No.</i>

717
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,328
<i>- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.</i>

718
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,402
<i>I'm Baby Brent.</i>

719
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,273
<i>Put your clothes back on.</i>

720
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:25,244
<i>Who am I?</i>

721
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:29,143
<i>Go ahead, Flint.</i>

722
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,718
<i>Everybody loves you.</i>

723
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:34,583
<i>Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!</i>

724
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,692
<i>Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!</i>

725
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,853
<i>Danger. Danger. Danger.</i>

726
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:20,229
<i>Salt-and-pepper wind?</i>

727
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,562
<i>Oregano.</i>

728
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:43,215
<i>Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.</i>

729
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,156
<i>I can turn it off.</i>

730
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,770
<i>All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.</i>

731
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:10,475
<i>Oh, no.</i>

732
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,449
<i>- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.</i>

733
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,716
<i>- Excuse me.
- No problem.</i>

734
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:24,025
<i>No.</i>

735
00:50:31,473 --> 00:50:33,805
<i>- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.</i>

736
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:43,251
<i>Condiments? Salt? Pepper?</i>

737
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:47,349
<i>Flint.</i>

738
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:53,725
<i>This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...</i>

739
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,363
<i>...where a spaghetti twister-</i>

740
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:59,729
<i>Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.</i>

741
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:04,134
<i>Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.</i>

742
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,964
<i>My tummy hurts.</i>

743
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,140
<i>Cal.</i>

744
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:13,472
<i>What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.</i>

745
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:17,278
<i>What? We have
an actual weather emergency.</i>

746
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,421
<i>Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...</i>

747
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:22,352
<i>...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.</i>

748
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:33,593
<i>Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the-</i>

749
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:34,997
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

750
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,434
<i>I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.</i>

751
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:40,040
<i>- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.</i>

752
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:42,404
<i>Everyone's in danger
because of me.</i>

753
00:51:42,578 --> 00:51:45,445
<i>Oh, it can't be that bad.</i>

754
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:48,443
<i>- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.</i>

755
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:51,085
<i>I can still stop the order
with the kill code.</i>

756
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:56,785
<i>- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.</i>

757
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,018
<i>Got to get the button.</i>

758
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:01,721
<i>Play. Fun. Fun. Play.</i>

759
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:06,527
<i>Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.</i>

760
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,861
<i>That's a radish.</i>

761
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:35,862
<i>That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.</i>

762
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:37,994
<i>What exactly did you order?</i>

763
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:42,160
<i>A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.</i>

764
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,731
<i>Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.</i>

765
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:53,974
<i>Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.</i>

766
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:57,112
<i>Strawberry.</i>

767
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,581
<i>- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.</i>

768
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:13,427
<i>Help, somebody.</i>

769
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,669
<i>Help me, please.</i>

770
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:17,601
<i>It's my son.</i>

771
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,605
<i>We need a doctor.</i>

772
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:22,608
<i>Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?</i>

773
00:53:22,778 --> 00:53:24,678
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

774
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:25,871
<i>You are?</i>

775
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,710
<i>I was, back in Guatemala.</i>

776
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,818
<i>I came here for a better life.</i>

777
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:32,180
<i>Pretty great decision, eh?</i>

778
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,690
<i>How is he, doc?</i>

779
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,059
<i>He's in a food coma.</i>

780
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,123
<i>Too much junk food.</i>

781
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,631
<i>I need a celery, stat.</i>

782
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:48,531
<i>Here you go.</i>

783
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,273
<i>- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.</i>

784
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,912
<i>I love you, son.</i>

785
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:03,542
<i>Looks like everything
turned out okay.</i>

786
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:04,845
<i>Not yet, it hasn't.</i>

787
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,387
<i>That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.</i>

788
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:11,082
<i>- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.</i>

789
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,492
<i>Go.</i>

790
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:21,534
<i>Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.</i>

791
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:22,829
<i>Can it, Patrick.</i>

792
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,338
<i>We are about to be in the epicentre
of a perfect food storm.</i>

793
00:54:26,508 --> 00:54:28,669
<i>It's going to spread
across the globe.</i>

794
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:32,511
<i>I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.</i>

795
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,740
<i>First, it'll hit New York...</i>

796
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,942
<i>...then Paris...</i>

797
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,020
<i>...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.</i>

798
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:45,990
<i>And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.</i>

799
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,686
<i>Flint?</i>

800
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:22,227
<i>Flint?</i>

801
00:55:22,397 --> 00:55:23,455
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

802
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,758
<i>What are you doing?</i>

803
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,596
<i>Well, I tried to help everybody...</i>

804
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,729
<i>...but instead I ruined everything.</i>

805
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:35,333
<i>I'm just a piece of junk.</i>

806
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,446
<i>So I threw myself away.</i>

807
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:43,282
<i>Along with all these
dumb inventions.</i>

808
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:45,317
<i>This is junk.</i>

809
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,147
<i>This is junk.</i>

810
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,151
<i>This is junk.</i>

811
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:56,862
<i>Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...</i>

812
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:59,500
<i>...and if it's not running,
you know-</i>

813
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,898
<i>Don't worry, Dad, I get it.</i>

814
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,538
<i>Mom was wrong about me.</i>

815
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,598
<i>I'm not an inventor.</i>

816
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:11,178
<i>I should've just quit when you said.</i>

817
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,253
<i>Well...</i>

818
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:24,887
<i>...when it rains, you put on a coat.</i>

819
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,923
<i>Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metaphors-</i>

820
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,024
<i>What?</i>

821
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,197
<i>My coat.</i>

822
00:56:48,717 --> 00:56:53,017
<i>Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.</i>

823
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:01,023
<i>Kill code downloading.</i>

824
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,898
<i>Redesigning. Virtualizing.</i>

825
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:07,660
<i>Cutting.</i>

826
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:10,827
<i>Welding. Forging.</i>

827
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:12,906
<i>- Wiring.
- Helping.</i>

828
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:14,702
<i>Testing.</i>

829
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,845
<i>Yes.</i>

830
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,513
<i>Flying Car 2.</i>

831
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,381
<i>Now with wings.</i>

832
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,958
<i>Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.</i>

833
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,962
<i>I have a macaroni
on my head.</i>

834
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:45,830
<i>Run.</i>

835
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,305
<i>No school!</i>

836
00:57:57,385 --> 00:58:01,549
<i>Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.</i>

837
00:58:09,464 --> 00:58:10,658
<i>Everyone.</i>

838
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:14,759
<i>I want to apologize.</i>

839
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:18,263
<i>Especially to you, Sam.</i>

840
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,567
<i>But I have a plan.</i>

841
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:23,176
<i>This flash drive contains a kill code.</i>

842
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:26,678
<i>I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...</i>

843
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,782
<i>...and shut it down forever...</i>

844
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,316
<i>...while you guys evacuate
the island, using bread</i>

845
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:33,283
<i>This is all his fault. Get him.</i>

846
00:58:33,455 --> 00:58:34,479
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

847
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:35,680
<i>Get Flint.</i>

848
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:38,951
<i>Let's rock his car back and forth.</i>

849
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:45,800
<i>Hey!</i>

850
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:49,235
<i>This mess we're in
is all our faults.</i>

851
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:53,572
<i>Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.</i>

852
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,210
<i>Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.</i>

853
00:58:56,378 --> 00:59:00,712
<i>In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.</i>

854
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:04,978
<i>I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.</i>

855
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:08,020
<i>And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.</i>

856
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,464
<i>Thank you, Earl.</i>

857
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,331
<i>- Sorry.
- It's okay.</i>

858
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:27,498
<i>- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.</i>

859
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,840
<i>I'm gonna go build a boat.</i>

860
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,470
<i>I'm coming with you.</i>

861
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:36,748
<i>You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.</i>

862
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,152
<i>I can't let you do this alone.</i>

863
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:42,051
<i>- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?</i>

864
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,055
<i>- Well, I just thought that we-
- No.</i>

865
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:45,250
<i>Okay.</i>

866
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:48,191
<i>- You are going to need a co-pilot.
- You're a pilot too?</i>

867
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,064
<i>Yes. I am also a particle physicist.</i>

868
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,292
<i>- Really?
- No, that was a joke.</i>

869
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,492
<i>I am also a comedian.</i>

870
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,872
<i>- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.</i>

871
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,134
<i>Brent, that's okay.</i>

872
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,404
<i>No, it's not okay.</i>

873
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,209
<i>I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.</i>

874
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:12,285
<i>But it was all just an illusion.</i>

875
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:16,550
<i>Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.</i>

876
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,920
<i>The car's pretty full, so...</i>

877
01:00:21,062 --> 01:00:22,495
<i>Yeah.</i>

878
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:23,790
<i>Brent.</i>

879
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:25,694
<i>Okay.</i>

880
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,077
<i>Good luck, son.</i>

881
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,922
<i>Steve.</i>

882
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:52,624
<i>Pea-soup fog.</i>

883
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:55,354
<i>Manny, hit the wipers.</i>

884
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,635
<i>There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.</i>

885
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:04,869
<i>It's almost as if it's...</i>

886
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,505
<i>Inside a giant meatball.</i>

887
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:14,741
<i>Water goes in the top...</i>

888
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:18,818
<i>...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.</i>

889
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,119
<i>Glad I'm wearing a diaper.</i>

890
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,034
<i>Anybody order pizza?</i>

891
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:42,500
<i>Hold on.</i>

892
01:01:42,677 --> 01:01:44,611
<i>The pizza's chasing us?</i>

893
01:01:44,779 --> 01:01:46,679
<i>Sentient food? That's impossible.</i>

894
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:49,783
<i>Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!</i>

895
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,352
<i>That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.</i>

896
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,216
<i>Pizza.</i>

897
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,620
<i>Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.</i>

898
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:05,029
<i>That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?</i>

899
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,901
<i>- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.</i>

900
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:14,735
<i>You're okay, great.</i>

901
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:17,434
<i>I need a favour. The fate of the world
depends on it!</i>

902
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,671
<i>Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?</i>

903
01:02:19,848 --> 01:02:24,080
<i>Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.</i>

904
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:32,683
<i>All right.</i>

905
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,057
<i>- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.</i>

906
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,949
<i>You're a lot better than me.</i>

907
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,215
<i>Okay, here's the plan:</i>

908
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,188
<i>Sam and I will enter the meteoroid
through the intake here...</i>

909
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,692
<i>...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.</i>

910
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:10,592
<i>Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.</i>

911
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:13,825
<i>Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...</i>

912
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,300
<i>...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in-</i>

913
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,996
<i>- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.</i>

914
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:20,198
<i>Just before then.</i>

915
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,208
<i>What about me, Brent?
What do I do?</i>

916
01:03:23,778 --> 01:03:27,578
<i>You can be president
of the back seat.</i>

917
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:30,442
<i>Deploy hatch.</i>

918
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:33,815
<i>Car upside down, go.</i>

919
01:03:35,256 --> 01:03:37,087
<i>Ladies first?</i>

920
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,049
<i>No?</i>

921
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:40,660
<i>All right.</i>

922
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,890
<i>Wait for me.</i>

923
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,090
<i>Great. Okay, I'm good.</i>

924
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:52,338
<i>As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the-</i>

925
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,271
<i>Yeah!</i>

926
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,672
<i>We're a team.</i>

927
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:16,797
<i>We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.</i>

928
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:20,867
<i>If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.</i>

929
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,764
<i>Brent, get out of that pie.</i>

930
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:24,165
<i>What's that?</i>

931
01:04:37,352 --> 01:04:39,115
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

932
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:48,493
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>

933
01:04:57,672 --> 01:04:59,697
<i>That's fry oil.</i>

934
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:07,780
<i>Flint, you have a call.</i>

935
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,177
<i>Flint, you have a-</i>

936
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,874
<i>Dad. Oh, okay, great.</i>

937
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:13,816
<i>On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."</i>

938
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:16,650
<i>- What-?
- Move that into my e-mail window...</i>

939
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,889
<i>...type in my name, and press send.</i>

940
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:23,387
<i>- Window?
- Okay, Dad...</i>

941
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:26,557
<i>...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?</i>

942
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,224
<i>Use the mouse to drag it.</i>

943
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,404
<i>- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.</i>

944
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:33,096
<i>Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.</i>

945
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:34,673
<i>It's not dragging.</i>

946
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,867
<i>Drag it across the desktop.</i>

947
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:42,942
<i>- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?</i>

948
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,112
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

949
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,553
<i>Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.</i>

950
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,756
<i>We are running out of time.</i>

951
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:58,490
<i>Let's move out. Go, go, go.</i>

952
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,497
<i>We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.</i>

953
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:04,001
<i>Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.</i>

954
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:12,276
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

955
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,915
<i>I have an important announcement.</i>

956
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:17,781
<i>See you, suckers.</i>

957
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,985
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

958
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,653
<i>And bon appétit.</i>

959
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:34,067
<i>- Cal.
- Calvin.</i>

960
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:45,171
<i>Cal, get back here.</i>

961
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,147
<i>- Foodalanche.
- Cal.</i>

962
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,983
<i>I'm not gonna lose you again.</i>

963
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,886
<i>Baby.</i>

964
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,525
<i>Hold on tight, Calvin.</i>

965
01:07:37,198 --> 01:07:41,225
<i>Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.</i>

966
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:45,897
<i>- Now what?
- Just click "send."</i>

967
01:07:46,074 --> 01:07:48,508
<i>Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!</i>

968
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,009
<i>- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.</i>

969
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,545
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

970
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:58,719
<i>Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?</i>

971
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:00,948
<i>Dad?</i>

972
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:02,683
<i>Hey, guys?</i>

973
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,762
<i>Holy crap balls.</i>

974
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:12,962
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

975
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,608
<i>I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.</i>

976
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:24,040
<i>I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and-</i>

977
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:25,736
<i>He's got me!</i>

978
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,343
<i>- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.</i>

979
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:34,421
<i>Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.</i>

980
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,787
<i>So if this is goodbye...</i>

981
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:40,592
<i>...thanks for trying
to set me straight.</i>

982
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:43,723
<i>Figured it out a little late, I guess.</i>

983
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,324
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

984
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,111
<i>Dad.</i>

985
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:10,552
<i>Hey, give me that phone back.</i>

986
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:29,903
<i>Baby Brent?</i>

987
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:33,103
<i>I'm not Baby Brent anymore.</i>

988
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:36,079
<i>I'm Chicken Brent.</i>

989
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,186
<i>And I'm finally contributing
to society.</i>

990
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:42,185
<i>Crotch kick.</i>

991
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:52,494
<i>Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.</i>

992
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,329
<i>You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.</i>

993
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:57,471
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

994
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,631
<i>It should be right down this hole.</i>

995
01:10:04,111 --> 01:10:05,135
<i>That's peanut brittle.</i>

996
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:10,384
<i>If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.</i>

997
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:13,286
<i>Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.</i>

998
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:17,151
<i>I might have just said that
to get you to like me.</i>

999
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:21,489
<i>So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?</i>

1000
01:10:25,032 --> 01:10:26,897
<i>Mustache.</i>

1001
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,695
<i>Mus-</i>

1002
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:39,635
<i>- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.</i>

1003
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:41,645
<i>- Taxi.
- Taxi.</i>

1004
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:44,478
<i>I asked for extra mustard.</i>

1005
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,926
<i>I was right.</i>

1006
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,498
<i>Hot tea?</i>

1007
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,696
<i>Did he say hot tea?</i>

1008
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:10,637
<i>"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."</i>

1009
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:12,472
<i>Run.</i>

1010
01:11:14,615 --> 01:11:17,516
<i>It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...</i>

1011
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:20,017
<i>...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...</i>

1012
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:23,315
<i>...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.</i>

1013
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:26,051
<i>What the what?</i>

1014
01:11:26,227 --> 01:11:28,752
<i>Hurry up, guys.</i>

1015
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:31,761
<i>After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...</i>

1016
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:35,699
<i>...I'll tug on the liquorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?</i>

1017
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:37,798
<i>Sounds great.</i>

1018
01:11:48,282 --> 01:11:49,544
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1019
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:55,954
<i>You got cut, didn't you?</i>

1020
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:59,088
<i>It's just a scratch.</i>

1021
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:03,958
<i>Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.</i>

1022
01:12:04,131 --> 01:12:05,291
<i>Just a second.</i>

1023
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:06,728
<i>What? No.</i>

1024
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:10,261
<i>- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.</i>

1025
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:13,305
<i>Flint, you'll be stuck down there.</i>

1026
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,635
<i>It's not ideal, no.</i>

1027
01:12:16,243 --> 01:12:18,643
<i>Come with us. We'll start over.</i>

1028
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:22,249
<i>We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.</i>

1029
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,179
<i>Sam, that's not a very good plan.</i>

1030
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,980
<i>It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.</i>

1031
01:12:27,755 --> 01:12:30,087
<i>Look, I like you, okay?</i>

1032
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,289
<i>Like- Like, as a friend?</i>

1033
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:36,259
<i>No.</i>

1034
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:39,126
<i>Like, "like you" like you.</i>

1035
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:43,531
<i>Me too.</i>

1036
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:47,197
<i>But about you.</i>

1037
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:53,671
<i>Goodbye, Sam.</i>

1038
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,373
<i>Flint. No.</i>

1039
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,812
<i>Hang on, Sam.</i>

1040
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,886
<i>Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.</i>

1041
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,021
<i>Pickles.</i>

1042
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:10,691
<i>Beets.</i>

1043
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:13,265
<i>Banana.</i>

1044
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:16,130
<i>Strawberry.</i>

1045
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:30,384
<i>- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.</i>

1046
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,917
<i>I'm circling the blowhole.</i>

1047
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:37,848
<i>Scared.</i>

1048
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:50,027
<i>Gummi Bears.</i>

1049
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:52,695
<i>Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.</i>

1050
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,206
<i>Hungry.</i>

1051
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:59,173
<i>Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.</i>

1052
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,405
<i>Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.</i>

1053
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:10,283
<i>Manny. Where are you?</i>

1054
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,308
<i>- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.</i>

1055
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,118
<i>Corn.</i>

1056
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,754
<i>Grabbing.</i>

1057
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:26,266
<i>Tying. Throwing.</i>

1058
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:31,033
<i>Waiting.</i>

1059
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:34,131
<i>Swinging.</i>

1060
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,217
<i>Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.</i>

1061
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:51,949
<i>Fight the power!</i>

1062
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,451
<i>Dad.</i>

1063
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:54,821
<i>No.</i>

1064
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:40,205
<i>When it rains, you put on a coat...</i>

1065
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:42,399
<i>...of Spray-On Shoes.</i>

1066
01:16:44,745 --> 01:16:47,407
<i>Yeah.</i>

1067
01:17:02,263 --> 01:17:04,925
<i>Just- There were chickens-</i>

1068
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,191
<i>Where's Flint?</i>

1069
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,497
<i>No!</i>

1070
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,834
<i>I know, kid.</i>

1071
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,270
<i>I know.</i>

1072
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,749
<i>- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.</i>

1073
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:05,856
<i>Flint?</i>

1074
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:10,428
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1075
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:31,579
<i>Your son was a great man.</i>

1076
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,574
<i>- Steve.
- Steve.</i>

1077
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:01,408
<i>- Flint.
- Brent.</i>

1078
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:03,140
<i>- Flint.
- Cal.</i>

1079
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:04,409
<i>- Steve.
- Flint.</i>

1080
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:05,813
<i>- Earl.
- Flint.</i>

1081
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:08,318
<i>- You guy.
- Steve.</i>

1082
01:19:10,691 --> 01:19:11,919
<i>Sam.</i>

1083
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:13,252
<i>Flint.</i>

1084
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:15,320
<i>Sam.</i>

1085
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:17,191
<i>- Flint.
- Flint.</i>

1086
01:19:17,364 --> 01:19:18,695
<i>- Dad.
- Steve.</i>

1087
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:20,663
<i>Flint.</i>

1088
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:28,464
<i>Look, when you-
When you cast your line...</i>

1089
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:32,442
<i>...if it's not straight-</i>

1090
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,375
<i>Oh, for crying out loud.</i>

1091
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,084
<i>I'm proud of you, Flint.</i>

1092
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,283
<i>I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...</i>

1093
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:48,519
<i>...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.</i>

1094
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:51,994
<i>You're talented,
you're a total original.</i>

1095
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,999
<i>And your lab is breathtaking.</i>

1096
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:58,161
<i>Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.</i>

1097
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:01,432
<i>And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:</i>

1098
01:20:01,608 --> 01:20:03,769
<i>"I told you so."</i>

1099
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:07,805
<i>Now, look,
when I take this thing off...</i>

1100
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:11,439
<i>...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...</i>

1101
01:20:12,219 --> 01:20:15,120
<i>...just know
that fishing metaphor means:</i>

1102
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:17,120
<i>I love my son.</i>

1103
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,589
<i>I love you too, Dad.</i>

1104
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:32,536
<i>So where were we?</i>

1105
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:34,503
<i>You were about to kiss me.</i>

1106
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,700
<i>Were you gonna kiss me back?</i>

1107
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:38,367
<i>Why don't you find out?</i>

1108
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:41,446
<i>Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.</i>

1109
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:43,378
<i>- Just kiss me.
- You know-</i>

1110
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:56,524
<i>Yeah. I'm a chicken.</i>

1111
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:18,281
<i>This was not well thought out.</i>

1112
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,089
