2
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,423
Come on!

3
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,434
Anybody here?

4
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,016
You scared me! Who is he?

5
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,296
The deaf mute.

6
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,928
So what do you want?

7
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,566
Go on. Go on.

8
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:14,132
Shall I tell her? She's possessed.

9
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,035
She doesn't talk, sleep or eat anymore.

10
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,840
There's a curse on her.

11
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,276
She says
a snake's twisting in her belly.

12
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,778
How did it get in there?

13
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,215
- Go on. Tell her.
- Come over here.

14
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,026
- You heard her.
- Come here.

15
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,394
When did it start?

16
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,907
When Don Ercole
promised us to two rich Americans.

17
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,771
- Look at these.
- I don't understand words on paper.

18
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,147
No, these aren't words.

19
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,587
They're real things. Look.

20
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,265
Look at the onion!

21
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,669
Is that money on the tree?

22
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,240
It's the new land.

23
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,644
Burn them.

24
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,041
Don't be afraid.

25
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,280
So what do we do?

26
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,953
Shall we remove it?

27
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,355
- I can't take it anymore!
- Get rid of that thing!

28
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,661
It's over. Calm down now.

29
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,687
We're here.

30
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,425
We've brought the stones.

31
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,399
We wanted to ask you something.

32
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,305
What should we do?

33
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,516
Should we leave,
or should we stay here?

34
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,767
Give us a sign, just a sign.

35
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,362
We'll wait here.

36
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,902
We won't move.

37
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,965
Blessed be the Lord.

38
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,577
- Zapparelli.
- Zapparelli.

39
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,315
Hey, there.

40
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,664
Get that goat.

41
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,266
- Where is he?
- Inside.

42
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,810
He's inside?

43
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,149
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,452
Here are our animals.

45
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,256
Take a look at them.

46
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,401
Take a look.
This one's stronger than a mare,

47
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:40,170
and it hasn't even been
a month since it was born.

48
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,872
Beautiful, huh?

49
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,143
Look at this one.

50
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,947
- You're sure this time?
- More than ever.

51
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,851
And your mother?

52
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:57,362
If she wants to come, fine.
If not, I'll leave her with you.

53
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,529
We're leaving.

54
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,060
We'll get you some clothes.

55
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,463
Leave the animals here.

56
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,416
Come in.

57
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,415
Come on. Have a seat.

58
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,121
Take that hat off.

59
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,794
Take that thing off!

60
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,412
Hands off!

61
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,918
Lift your foot.

62
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,762
These boots used
to belong to Giovanni Gramigna,

63
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,272
a scoundrel with a heart of gold.

64
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,434
- They seem good to me.
- They are good. Lift your foot.

65
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:29,110
Look at these wooden soles.
You'll never wear them out.

66
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,086
Your foot.

67
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,427
These belonged
to the Baron's son, who died as a child.

68
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,932
Take my advice.
Don't put them on until you get to town.

69
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,572
Of course.

70
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,512
You understand?
These are the Baron's boots.

71
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,148
This here

72
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,555
is for Salvatore.

73
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,001
This, on the other hand, is for Angelo.

74
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,140
As for this, it's for Pietro.

75
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,476
It was Bastianuzzo's.
May he rest in peace.

76
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,119
These are clothes for a prince.

77
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,950
- I can't send you to America in rags.
- God will reward you.

78
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,426
Put them on.
Let's see what you look like.

79
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,798
How will I find my brother there?

80
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,636
Your brother,
maybe he's someone important now.

81
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,537
Maybe he's changed his name,

82
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,773
but he couldn't have changed his face.
You two are identical.

83
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:10,619
I bet they'll think you're him
and even treat you like a king.

84
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:41,747
Know where the cloaks are from?
They belonged to the Puccia bandits.

85
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,688
That way, our dead will travel with you.

86
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,291
Come on. Enough goodbyes! Let's go!

87
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,836
Turn left.

88
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,119
When did your brother leave?

89
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,727
When Pietro was born.

90
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,133
- Why didn't we leave, too?
- Because.

91
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,233
What's your brother like?

92
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,807
What do you mean?
He's my spitting image. We're twins.

93
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,342
How can we be sure we'll find him?

94
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,820
Of course we'll find him.
He looks exactly like me.

95
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,856
Your clothes!

96
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,831
Stop!

97
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:13,110
Stop! Enough! You bloody fool!

98
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,807
Hold this!

99
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,579
Look at you!

100
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,557
- You're sick.
- Shut up!

101
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,955
Pick up your things.

102
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,003
Are you planning
to go to America in rags?

103
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,368
Your shoes!

104
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,605
- I've lost my shoes.
- Too bad.

105
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:55,016
You'll walk
to America barefoot, you fool.

106
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,957
- No!
- Find them. Where are they?

107
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,022
- I'm cursed.
- I've got them.

108
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,888
Pick them up!

109
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,001
Get going! Get!

110
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:21,335
Come on!
Your clothes! Fold them up properly.

111
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,113
We have to arrive looking like princes!

112
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,714
Here.

113
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,152
Don't get it dirty. I'm cursed.

114
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,701
Come on!

115
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,412
- Look at that!
- What?

116
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,245
Come on!

117
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,284
- Hey, you!
- All the spirits are here!

118
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,154
They're angry with us.
They'll never let us leave!

119
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,852
Can't the spirits come with us?

120
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,561
They fear the sea.

121
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:27,037
They say thousands
of evil souls fly above the sea.

122
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,164
So talk them round!

123
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,775
Damn me and my ancestors!

124
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,648
Do we have to stay here?
Are we going to die here?

125
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,151
A great life this is!

126
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,560
She thinks I'm afraid.

127
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,366
She thinks I'm afraid!

128
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,768
Let's stay, then.

129
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,550
Come out now.

130
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,984
Come on. We have to go.

131
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,566
Mum, where are you going?

132
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,446
To look for you, wretch.
Your brother can't take anymore.

133
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,151
You left me here alone.
I want to see the new land, too.

134
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,448
- The poor thing, can he come?
- Mum!

135
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,451
I'm bringing him to you.

136
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,755
Come over here. Come on.

137
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,300
Such grim looks! Smile. Smile.

138
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,073
Smile. Smile.

139
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,215
Those who leave are seeds
to be planted in more fertile land.

140
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,713
You're our future.

141
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,086
Embrace each other now.

142
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,390
Embrace each other
as if you'll meet again soon.

143
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,675
That'll do. Get ready.

144
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,440
God will guide you there.

145
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,754
Hurry up now. Let's get going.

146
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:36,363
Salvatore, you see these two girls?
I'm entrusting them to you.

147
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:41,839
They have to arrive as they left.

148
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,774
- And how is that?
- As decent girls.

149
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,577
Come on!

150
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,214
Climb on, Pietro.

151
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,445
Come on! Let's go!

152
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,137
Help me with the shoes!

153
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,474
This is so fresh it'll last until America!

154
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,570
We don't want it!

155
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,475
Salvatore, help me down!

156
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,283
Get your things.

157
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,023
Don't touch anything!

158
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,570
Pietro! Where are you?

159
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,141
- Don't get lost!
- Come over here!

160
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,972
Stick together!

161
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,977
We don't want it. Keep moving!

162
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,020
Give us a break!

163
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,078
Move!

164
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,316
Move it!

165
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,700
What the hell do you want?

166
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,373
- You're leaving for America?
- Yes.

167
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,180
- You have to come with me.
- Why didn't you say so?

168
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,951
Can you take us to the doctor?

169
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,923
- Yes.
- So take us there!

170
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,650
- Are you ill?
- We're going to America.

171
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,591
Any rashes?
Stomach ache? Any itches?

172
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,563
Let me see your tongue.
Got any fleas? Any itching?

173
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:59,728
Are you blind, deaf or mute?
How do you feel? Got a fever?

174
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,932
He's not speaking.
Is he mute? This one's mute!

175
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,374
No, there's no mute here.

176
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:10,504
- They repatriate the deaf mutes.
- What do they do?

177
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,981
- They send them home.
- Where?

178
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:17,282
I can sell you a cure I've invented.
It makes the dead talk.

179
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:22,054
That's rubbish! I'm a healer.
I know about doctor things.

180
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,320
Maybe you do, maybe you don't,

181
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,161
but this cure for mutes
is something you have to buy.

182
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,595
Let me see if you have fleas.

183
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:37,835
Stick your tongue out. Come on!

184
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,367
- Move on! Move on!
- Get out of here!

185
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,311
- Where are you taking that?
- To America.

186
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,216
- You have to pay.
- What?

187
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,120
- You have to pay for it.
- What?

188
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,684
- It only costs two cents.
- Two cents?

189
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,785
- Two cents.
- Why?

190
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,989
- Because it's for sale.
- What is it?

191
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,589
- Medicine for the teeth.
- For the teeth?

192
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,034
- He said it was for mutes!
- No, it's for teeth.

193
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,402
We don't need it, then. Let's go.

194
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:37,132
Mancuso, four of us and these ladies
who are getting married.

195
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,669
Do you have photos? Can I see them?

196
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,604
- Your photos.
- We don't have them.

197
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,907
Carmelo, get photos done
for these four!

198
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,776
Okay. Follow me.

199
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,052
Watch where you're going.

200
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,785
Off you go. Off you go.

201
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,729
Next. Come on.

202
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,898
- Miss, are you together?
- Yes.

203
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,109
- How many are you?
- Mancuso.

204
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,737
Your name?

205
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,072
Mancuso...

206
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,078
- Your name?
- Mancuso, Salvatore.

207
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,479
Mancuso, Salvatore.

208
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,115
- You?
- Angelo.

209
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:11,951
Angelo. You? What's your name?

210
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,624
- What's his name?
- Mancuso, Pietro.

211
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,032
Mancuso, Pietro.

212
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,902
And you, madam, what's your name?

213
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,635
- Fortunata.
- Fortunata.

214
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,238
- And you, miss?
- Rita.

215
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,645
- Rita. What's your name?
- Rosa.

216
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,914
- Rosa. And you, miss?
- Lucy.

217
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,080
Luce.

218
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,420
You can go. Off you go!

219
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,897
Excuse me, miss. Miss!
You with the red hair!

220
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,671
- I'm talking to you. Is she with you?
- No!

221
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:25,327
- Why are we still here? Let's go.
- Hey, I'm talking to the lady.

222
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,658
Why? Curious, huh?

223
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,612
Where are you off to? Get lost!

224
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:21,755
Salvatore, what's she got
to do with us? Let's go.

225
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,119
Come on!

226
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,550
Whatever that medicine was,
let's just get out of here.

227
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,644
Come on, Pietro.

228
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,595
Third class! Show your tickets!

229
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:18,468
Stick together!
Stick together! Come on, Pietro.

230
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,219
- Where are you going?
- Come back, you fool!

231
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,690
- Damn you!
- Stubborn idiot!

232
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,318
Stay with me, you blockhead!

233
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:58,898
Come on! Come on! Let us through!

234
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:03,140
No, not here. Men here, women there.

235
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,973
All the women together,
all the men together.

236
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,646
No pushing! Stop pushing!

237
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:17,389
Salvatore! Get out of my way!

238
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,696
- Get your hands off me!
- She's my mother!

239
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,860
Mancuso, there are four of us.
We're all Mancusos.

240
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,837
- Yes, yes. Men here, women there.
- You stay with me.

241
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,074
Stay calm!

242
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,185
I have my whole family with me!

243
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,544
Excuse me, madam. This is my bed.

244
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,985
- I'm here now.
- Look. It's written here.

245
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,187
- I can't read.
- I'm sorry, madam.

246
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:45,011
- Dad!
- Get a bed, Pietro.

247
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:51,612
That's good. Take that one.

248
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,057
Good, Pietro.

249
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,830
I'll go here. Just below, Dad.

250
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,980
- Is your father comfortable?
- Yes.

251
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,677
He's an old man, you know.

252
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:27,688
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Spera, Calogero, from Realimici.

253
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,132
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

254
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:41,035
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.
- Mangiapane, Giuseppe, from Carini.

255
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:46,267
- Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.
- Mancuso, Salvatore, from Petralia.

256
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,436
This is my son.

257
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,447
Esposito, Nicola, from Cinisi.

258
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,677
I've never slept
with so many foreigners before.

259
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:03,250
Foreigners? But we're not foreigners!
We're all Italian.

260
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,420
- Italian?
- Italian.

261
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,364
- We don't speak the same way.
- Don't you know you're Italian?

262
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,668
If you say so.

263
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,636
If you know so much,
tell me something.

264
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:19,039
- When do we see Big Luciano?
- Who?

265
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,202
He means the big ocean, the Atlantic.

266
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,248
- That's right.
- In a week or so.

267
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,515
Can you help me, please?

268
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,190
Thank you.

269
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,247
- Why turn your dress inside out?
- What?

270
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,217
Why did you turn
your dress inside out?

271
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,550
To keep it clean on the journey.

272
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,827
- What's your name?
- Rita.

273
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,360
- What's the garlic for?
- So I won't fall ill.

274
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,762
- Want some?
- No, thanks. It stinks.

275
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,269
- What's your name?
- Angela.

276
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:39,179
God only knows how long
we're going to be stuck here,

277
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:45,195
and this is just the beginning.
I never thought I'd live to see this.

278
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,390
- I should have stayed at home.
- Madam. Madam.

279
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,231
Could you lower your voice?
I have a headache.

280
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,402
Then have one! What do I care?
Who does she think she is?

281
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,408
This is the last thing I needed.

282
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,505
A journey like this ahead,
and she has a headache.

283
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,712
There's nothing here.

284
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,159
- Nothing at all.
- We're on the sea.

285
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,470
Come over here.

286
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,634
Wait.

287
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:41,841
Come here, Mum.
Sit down here. Sit down.

288
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,646
Sit down.

289
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,420
They have such big, fine horses
because their streets are long.

290
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:06,451
I hear they even
have rivers of milk in California.

291
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:11,600
I can't swim, but I wouldn't mind
a dip in a river of milk.

292
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:17,305
Sure, maybe there are even
flying donkeys that scatter money.

293
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,002
You really believe that?

294
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,903
Hey, Caruso.

295
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:30,916
Take this to Miss Luce.
Tell her that it's from Mr. Mangiapane.

296
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,989
Give this to Rita from Giovanni.

297
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:46,027
Excuse me.
What are you up to with Luce?

298
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,496
Nothing. And you?

299
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,473
- She looked at me.
- At me, too.

300
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,708
How could she look at you
if she looked at me?

301
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,838
- She looked at me.
- You're making it up.

302
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:02,248
You can't be serious.
Anyone can have her.

303
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,080
- You just have to pay.
- Pay?

304
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,357
With all due respect,
you shouldn't talk like that.

305
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,621
Miss Luce is traveling with me,

306
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:17,590
and no one is to disrespect her.
Leave it at that.

307
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,619
Miss Luce. Miss Luce.

308
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,116
- My father sent this.
- Thank you.

309
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,797
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.

310
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,526
She died long ago.

311
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,141
The lady's not interested in all that.

312
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,310
- Aren't you married?
- No.

313
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,846
- Don't you want to marry?
- That's enough! Shut up now.

314
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:34,770
Apparently, Miss Luce
was married to a nobleman.

315
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,903
He was related to their king.

316
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,609
- He had a castle.
- She fell for an American.

317
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,584
She left her husband to go to America.

318
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,651
When she got there,
her American didn't turn up.

319
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:52,685
- She couldn't get in alone.
- She's looking for a man now.

320
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:56,254
They say Luce was married to a prince,

321
00:58:56,332 --> 00:59:00,325
but he had so many wives
he sent her to America.

322
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,368
She's all on her own now,

323
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,500
and she needs a man to care for her.

324
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:12,005
- Perhaps she's a queen.
- How should I know?

325
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,371
The sleepwalker's back.

326
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:23,644
If you want my men's protection,
you have to earn it.

327
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,915
Behave yourself like the rest of us.

328
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,890
My son's not right for you.
You're too foreign.

329
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,058
You need a man who can support you.
Look at your hands.

330
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:40,260
Why? What's wrong with my hands?

331
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,294
Come here, Pietro!

332
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,838
Don't be scared. Come with me.

333
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,575
You'll wake him!

334
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,344
Let go of me!

335
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,600
So where's America?

336
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:35,777
It's here, but you can't see it.

337
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

338
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,822
You look younger without a mustache.

339
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,364
I'm still young, though.

340
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:06,611
Salvatore, would you marry me?

341
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,710
Who? Me?

342
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,850
Of course. Right away.

343
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,928
You're the one asking me?

344
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,828
I need a man to help me get in.

345
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,163
I'm here. When can we get married?

346
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:38,008
When we reach the island,
you'll have to call me out.

347
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,778
I'll call you right away. I'm not scared.

348
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,916
I'm not marrying you for love.

349
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,424
Love?

350
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,295
We hardly know each other.

351
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,600
Those things take time.

352
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,979
Isn't that right? Isn't that right?

353
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,010
Yes.

354
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,082
Here's what we'll do.

355
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,219
Give me a lock of your hair.

356
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,864
Now we won't lose each other.

357
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,736
I don't believe in magic.

358
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,114
With time, I'll teach you.

359
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,463
- We don't have all day.
- Stay behind the line.

360
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,061
Stop there!

361
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:16,411
Stay behind the line!
Over there! Over there! Move along!

362
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:20,414
Put the bags down! Put the bags down!

363
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,653
Take your hats off!

364
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,714
Lower your head.

365
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,822
What month is it?

366
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,430
What day is it?

367
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,628
What month is it?

368
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,434
What day is it?

369
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,837
I'd like to know. What day is it?

370
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,684
Leave the cross there.

371
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,753
Do you understand me?

372
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,797
Why are you doing this?

373
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,724
Can't you answer?

374
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,193
- Your name?
- Mancuso, Salvatore.

375
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,296
- Where are you from?
- Petralia Sottana.

376
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,141
- How old are you?
- Thirty-seven.

377
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,699
Thirty-seven.

378
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,711
- Pick up your bags!
- Was that so hard?

379
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:30,149
Pick up your bags!

380
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,244
In line! In line!

381
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:41,354
Nice and neat.
I want neat lines above all.

382
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,958
Don't push.

383
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:46,057
In line!

384
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:52,807
Look down. Look up. Down. Up.

385
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,707
Don't worry. It's all right. Look down.

386
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:05,048
Open your eyes.
Keep still. We won't hurt you.

387
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,687
- Try not to move.
- Off you go.

388
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,348
Next.

389
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,253
Hat.

390
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,735
Lift your hands. Lift your hands.

391
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,741
Spread your fingers.

392
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,746
Turn your hands around.

393
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:49,655
Open wide. Stick your tongue out.

394
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,887
Come on. Further. Further.

395
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,063
To one side.

396
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,156
Further out.

397
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,305
Wider. Stick your tongue out.

398
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,406
Further out. Further out.

399
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,842
Have you been sick?

400
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,513
Can you speak?

401
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,859
Why don't you answer?

402
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,421
He's my son.

403
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,593
Can't you make him speak?

404
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:38,268
He's a stubborn one,
but he works harder than a mule.

405
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,174
- Take your trousers off.
- Take your pants off.

406
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,303
Take them off.

407
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,249
Come on! Come on!

408
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:51,216
- Leave your brother alone.
- What are you doing?

409
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:55,016
Pietro. Pietro, don't be afraid.
Take them off.

410
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,956
He's still shaken
from the journey, poor kid.

411
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,691
He'll do it now! He'll do it now!

412
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,930
My son stays with... Okay.

413
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,598
My son stays with me!

414
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,767
- Come back here.
- I'm telling you he's my son!

415
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:18,973
- We have to finish the examination.
- What examination?

416
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:21,072
Don't worry, Pietro.

417
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:24,414
- My son...
- Come. Come.

418
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,843
Lie down, madam.

419
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:03,224
Lie down on your side, please.

420
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,587
Like this, with your head here.

421
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:20,072
What's she doing? Get your hands off.
What are you doing?

422
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:25,044
- Calm down. It's procedure.
- Get your hands off me!

423
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:26,841
I don't want anyone touching me!

424
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:03,349
Don't be afraid.
Take your time. Think hard.

425
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,865
How many legs on a horse?

426
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:29,233
Four.

427
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,576
How many legs on a horse
and how many on a hen?

428
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,944
Four and two.

429
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,687
Therefore?

430
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,984
- They walk.
- No.

431
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,951
How many legs in all?

432
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:02,475
How many legs
on a pig, a hen and a goat?

433
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:21,217
All right. All right.

434
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:52,651
This is the house.

435
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:58,427
You can dry things here
or keep animals.

436
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,994
You can put them here.

437
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:13,508
You're out at sea in a small boat.
There's a big storm.

438
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,842
There are two sacks in the boat.

439
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,911
One is full of bread,
and the other, full of gold.

440
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:24,118
Which do you throw overboard?

441
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,231
Why throw them overboard?

442
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:39,371
Get rid of the gold?
I can't throw gold away.

443
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,070
I eat the bread.

444
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,179
I don't throw anything overboard.

445
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:01,360
Is that right? Is it right?

446
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,518
Let's try an exercise now.

447
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:52,664
I'll give you instructions, and you
have to carry them out in order.

448
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,901
Open the door
and put the chair near the door.

449
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,075
You have to do things
in the order that I tell you.

450
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:16,181
First, you open the door,
then you move the chair.

451
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:23,859
You got it wrong.

452
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:28,425
I asked you to open the door
and then take the chair over to it.

453
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,494
Start again.

454
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,874
That's better.

455
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,145
Now

456
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:54,191
open the door,
put the chair near the door,

457
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:59,456
pick up the book and put it on the floor.

458
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,259
Miss Rita D'Agostino, stand up, please.

459
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:19,257
Do you acknowledge
this man as your future husband?

460
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:29,358
Miss, look up a little, please.

461
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,205
Miss, do you acknowledge
this man as your future husband?

462
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,272
Yes.

463
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:53,692
The wedding will be
on the 17th at Ellis Island.

464
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,960
Please be seated.

465
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:12,979
Miss Rosa Napolitano,
please stand up.

466
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,273
Miss, do you acknowledge
this man as your future husband?

467
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:48,537
- How old are you?
- Thirty-five.

468
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,344
- How old?
- Thirty-five.

469
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:56,189
Liar! Wretch!

470
01:34:57,992 --> 01:35:01,086
I thought
you were a lot younger and taller.

471
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,288
You're so short.

472
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:07,797
Anyone would think
you were still sitting.

473
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:11,298
This is what I left my family for?

474
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:15,738
I already have a father at home.
I don't need another!

475
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,707
Ugly wretch! Have you got money?

476
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:28,651
Do you acknowledge
this man as your future husband?

477
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:35,919
Yes.

478
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:46,795
The wedding will be
on the 17th at Ellis Island.

479
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,300
Please be seated.

480
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:56,245
Miss Dolores Torres, please stand up.

481
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:10,089
Mr. Sergio Dominguez.

482
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,337
Sergio Dominguez, I know you're here.

483
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:23,301
Why won't you show yourself?

484
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,578
How long will you leave me here?

485
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,813
I've been waiting for days now.

486
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:10,314
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso. Thank you.

487
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:16,816
Mrs. Fortunata Mancuso.

488
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,825
- Present.
- Please.

489
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,490
I'm fine sitting here.

490
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:32,096
What is that stuff?
All those stars and crosses?

491
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:40,309
Madam, do you think
we wish to do you harm?

492
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,109
What do you want from us?

493
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:52,621
Who do you mean?

494
01:38:53,527 --> 01:38:55,757
Everyone from the old world.

495
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:09,442
Madam, we want to know if you're
fit enough to enter the new world.

496
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,906
And you think you're God?

497
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:20,183
Who are you to decide if we're fit or not
to enter this new world of yours?

498
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:36,594
Madam, if you wish
to enter the new world,

499
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:39,832
you must accept its rules.
Sit here and take the exam,

500
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:43,172
or we'll deport you.
We'll send you home.

501
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:53,447
Mr. Marcello Tarsitano, please.

502
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:18,236
What the hell is this glass?

503
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,878
It's frosted glass.
You can't see anything.

504
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:24,243
- Not a thing.
- You can see from up there.

505
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,147
We'd have to climb up.

506
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:30,721
- Shall we climb up?
- Let's do it.

507
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:47,002
What are those long things?

508
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:49,599
- They look like towers.
- Bell towers.

509
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:54,839
- Could they be houses?
- They're houses, 100 floors high!

510
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:57,546
How do you get up there?

511
01:40:57,618 --> 01:41:02,954
There's a wooden box that carries
people up and down, on its own.

512
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:04,820
- On its own?
- On its own.

513
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:08,419
- Can animals go up, too?
- Everything can go up.

514
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:12,226
- I wouldn't like to go home in a box.
- Me, neither.

515
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:17,161
- My house has to be on the ground.
- I'd like a house in the sky.

516
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:24,842
What are you doing? Get down now!

517
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:46,665
- What do we do? Pray, too?
- <i>Our Father</i> or <i>Ave Maria?</i>

518
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,825
Let's say them all.

519
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:52,405
"In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit..."

520
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:36,807
It's like eating a cloud.

521
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:39,809
God be praised.

522
01:43:57,698 --> 01:44:01,259
Mr. Mancuso,
have you filled out the form?

523
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:03,928
No.

524
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:09,733
Do you know this woman?

525
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:12,835
You bet I know her,
and she knows me, too.

526
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,174
What is her name, please?

527
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:21,514
- Luce.
- Luce what?

528
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:28,786
- Luce Reed. You always forget it.
- Luce Reed.

529
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:37,201
Please complete the form. Here.

530
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:55,746
What's going on?
What do I do with this thing?

531
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,654
You don't want to marry me?

532
01:45:01,728 --> 01:45:05,186
Of course I do,
but you have to write it down.

533
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:18,936
I can't write. I can't read, either.
Can't we get married anymore?

534
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:07,753
Mr. Salvatore Mancuso,
please stand up.

535
01:46:15,001 --> 01:46:18,767
Mr. Mancuso, do you acknowledge
this woman as your future bride?

536
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:23,805
Of course.
Would I be here otherwise? Yes.

537
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:36,220
The wedding will be at Ellis Island.
Date to be determined.

538
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:39,224
Do you have flowers for your fiancée?

539
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:45,788
I'll offer you this crown that flies.

540
01:48:09,182 --> 01:48:11,412
Mr. Mancuso, step forward.

541
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:30,568
Mr. Mancuso, your son
is mute and cannot be admitted.

542
01:48:30,904 --> 01:48:33,702
Your mother is feeble-minded
and cannot be admitted.

543
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:40,209
What will you do now, continue
the admission process or return home?

544
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,810
But...

545
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:50,586
Excuse me. I...

546
01:48:53,293 --> 01:48:55,818
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

547
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,958
but I don't understand.

548
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:07,372
What's wrong?
How can they be a problem?

549
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:10,503
How are my mother
and my son a problem

550
01:49:11,244 --> 01:49:14,338
with all the land
and work you have here?

551
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:24,787
Because he doesn't speak?
It's for the best, you know.

552
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:29,325
This way, he won't bore anyone.
He'll never complain.

553
01:49:30,697 --> 01:49:34,258
And, my mother, look at her.
She's like a young girl.

554
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:38,195
True, she talks a lot,

555
01:49:38,972 --> 01:49:41,873
but I'll keep her indoors
and won't let her out.

556
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:48,344
We've come all this way
only to be parted now?

557
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:52,812
Dad,

558
01:49:53,753 --> 01:49:58,554
Grandma told me
she wants to go home.

559
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:11,226
She also told me that we have to stay.

560
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:18,936
