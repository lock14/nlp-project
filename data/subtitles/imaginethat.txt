1
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:40,547
Mr. Danielson?

2
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,627
He took my blanket!

3
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:43,947
Okay. Everybody calm down!
Calm down, everybody.

4
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,748
You'll get your blanket!

5
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:53,587
It's mine! Legally,
it's mine! It's mine!

6
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,308
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

7
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,267
Evan, get help. Get help!

8
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,187
I don't need help!
What I need is my blanket!

9
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:05,028
- Man, you're crazy!
- I am not crazy! I want my goo-gaa!

10
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,468
I want my goo-gaa!

11
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,709
He wasn't always this way.

12
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:13,628
Once upon a time, he was a king.

13
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,429
The king of Somewhere.

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,069
Strong and powerful.

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,228
What I'm suggesting is that

16
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,989
you reallocate 8% of your equity
into international markets.

17
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:28,429
He protected his loyal subjects
and made them feel safe.

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,669
All right, are you looking at the charts?

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,189
Well, these are actually very
conservative projections. Yes they are.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,509
But one day he left his Kingdom

21
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,150
and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere.

22
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,030
Something no one could
have ever imagined.

23
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,831
Imagine That

24
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,751
Everybody's upped their stocks...

25
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,831
I am here to talk about finances,
Wall Street...

26
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:24,152
In Nowhere Land,
everybody wanted to be king,

27
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:27,112
or at least they all try to be.

28
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,111
Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather.

29
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:30,552
- You got a what?
- A feather.

30
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:32,112
It was on my desk with a note attached.

31
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:33,472
- From Johnny Whitefeather?
- Yup.

32
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,512
What'd the note say?

33
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:37,912
"I'll be at your 9:00 a. m. See you
in there. Ain't nothing but a thing. "

34
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:41,192
- Wow. Then the rumor must be true.
- What? What rumor?

35
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,673
- Stevens is cashing in.
- What?

36
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,752
- He's selling the company?
- He has to be.

37
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,952
His replacement is gonna be me
or Johnny!

38
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,473
You're gonna get this job!

39
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:52,233
- Hey. Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

40
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,193
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

41
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:55,753
It was a very strange place.

42
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:57,793
...and they've narrowed it down
to our firm and two others.

43
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,153
And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is
gonna be in the meeting.

44
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:03,794
The King was really unhappy there.
He just couldn't figure out why.

45
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,513
- Hey, Tod!
- What's up, Mr. D?

46
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:07,433
Take this down to graphics
and add it to my chart, all right?

47
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,074
- After I...
- Now.

48
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:11,913
- What about the...
- Hey, "now" now, man. What's up?

49
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:14,194
- How much are we paying that guy?
- He's an unpaid intern.

50
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,153
It might be too much.

51
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,314
I think it was because he was
always working to protect his castle

52
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,595
from those who wanted
to steal his crown.

53
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:25,114
Johnny Whitefeather.

54
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:29,075
Evan Danielson.
Fellow salmon swimming upstream.

55
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:31,915
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:37,795
So those of us he left behind
went out into the land to rescue him.

57
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,755
Whip, I said I'd sit you down with
our two best financial managers.

58
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,956
Evan's been our number-one guy
for the last eight and a half years.

59
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,675
Johnny's been with us for 16 months,

60
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,556
but he's already
one of our top producers.

61
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:56,436
Either way, you'll be well taken care of
here at Smith/Stevens.

62
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,596
- Evan?
- Mr. Bryson.

63
00:03:58,597 --> 00:03:59,956
You've made some
really sound investments,

64
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:03,357
but quite frankly, I think we can do
better. Let's see if you agree.

65
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:06,997
Evan Danielson's office.

66
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:11,876
Now, this will give you a solid base of
capital and a 9 to 11 % yield, annually.

67
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,437
Yeah, I understand. Is it...
His daughter?

68
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,398
Did you call her mother?

69
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:21,478
Because if I say it's urgent
and he's really, really...

70
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:24,438
The goo-gaa?

71
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,237
- Fantastic, Evan.
- Thank you, Tom.

72
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:30,478
- Johnny?
- Thank you, Tom. Whip.

73
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:34,158
Dave, Lee, Troy.
I see those looks of skepticism,

74
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,038
just like old man Stevens
the first week that he hired me.

75
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,438
Said to himself, "I hired an Indian.
Can he handle money?"

76
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,359
And how.

77
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,878
Hey, I really appreciate
you letting me contribute

78
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,799
a little piece of venison
to your potlatch.

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,439
Okay.

80
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,679
We're here under one sky.

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,240
All of us, under one sky.
Let's appreciate that.

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,519
One sky.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,119
Evan Danielson,
that man over there is a seer.

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,320
Uses the whole eye.

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,080
But there is a difference between sight

86
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:17,560
and vision.

87
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:23,160
Sight is about
what lies just in front of us.

88
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:27,281
Vision is about what lies ahead.

89
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:30,321
- The genius of the hawk...
- Excuse me.

90
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,401
Johnny, sorry to interrupt you

91
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:33,681
in one of your always interesting stories
about nature,

92
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,161
but, gentlemen, I have...
I'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson,

93
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,321
in the very capable hands of
my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here.

94
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,241
I have a little family emergency at my
daughter's school I have to take care of.

95
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,601
Thank you for your time, sir.

96
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,361
That's what we're all talking about.

97
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:49,362
Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life.

98
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,242
Yeah. Hakuna matata.

99
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,442
I'm so sorry, but the school kept calling.

100
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,121
- Don't tell me. The goo-gaa.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,882
I hate that blanket!

102
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:02,042
We don't normally allow
any kind of security items at school,

103
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,282
but because of yours
and Trish's separation,

104
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:05,922
we made a temporary exception.

105
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:09,723
Unfortunately,
it's just not workable anymore.

106
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,563
Hey, you guys.

107
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:12,762
So this is why I was called out of work?

108
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,603
Because my daughter's
sitting by herself at recess?

109
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:16,883
No, the reason I called you,
Mr. Danielson,

110
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,443
is because her class went inside
45 minutes ago.

111
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:23,323
She's still sitting here because
Kupida and Mopida told her to.

112
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:27,244
- Kupida and Mopida are...
- Yeah. I know. Her imaginary friends.

113
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:30,003
I told Trish we're gonna have to
do something about that blanket.

114
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,123
Well, Trish and I discussed this,

115
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,883
and we both feel that
what needs to be dealt with

116
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:36,443
is the reason why she still feels
she needs a blanket.

117
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,204
It's usually an indication of
some kind of emotional needs

118
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,164
that haven't been met.

119
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:44,164
What's happening? Are they talking?

120
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,124
Well, you know, sometimes,
these things are like a Band-Aid.

121
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,044
You just have to rip it off.

122
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,445
Right.

123
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,684
Rip it.

124
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,685
Rip.

125
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:02,685
Kupida. I can't hear you both
at the same time.

126
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,925
Go ahead, Mopida.

127
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,446
Wait. Wait a minute.
Someone's coming.

128
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,085
Hey, Liv.

129
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,646
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

130
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,606
Hey, remember we talked about
how the day was gonna come

131
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,126
when you couldn't take the goo-gaa
to school with you anymore?

132
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,686
That day is gonna be today.

133
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,845
So what Daddy's gonna do
is I'm gonna take the goo-gaa.

134
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:25,966
I'm gonna hold on to it for you.

135
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,566
When you get home from school,
you'll get it back then, all right?

136
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,807
All right, sweetie.
Just give me the goo-gaa.

137
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,847
And you have a great day.
All right, baby.

138
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,567
As you know,
the Mile High City Arts Council

139
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:58,368
relies solely on contributions.

140
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:03,208
Yeah. I've got 12 people and four desks.
We need your money.

141
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,448
Mr. Cosgrove, can I call you right back?

142
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,128
Trish, please, this is a really bad week.

143
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,568
Evan, I told you three months ago
that this week was pledge week.

144
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,249
- That's this week?
- Yes.

145
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,409
You promised me you wouldn't do this.
You promised me.

146
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,048
Look, Evan,
I know you and her haven't ever...

147
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:23,409
- Trish, please, not this week.
- had a chance...

148
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,770
- Not this week. I'm begging you.
- to connect.

149
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,914
- Can we flip-flop...
- No.

150
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,162
and I'll do it next week?
I promise you...

151
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,649
No, Evan,
even if I could, I wouldn't.

152
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,930
Evan, why did you tell me
you even wanted to have children?

153
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:42,770
'Cause I did. I do!

154
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,331
I just didn't know
I'd be so bad at it.

155
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:50,770
You know, Evan,
you're a really smart guy.

156
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,571
You make huge deals every day.

157
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:57,691
I'm sure you'll find a way
to deal with her.

158
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,971
Sweetie, you're gonna go
with Daddy, okay?

159
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,731
- Okay.
- He's so excited.

160
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,611
And I'm gonna call you every night
to say good night.

161
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,611
- Promise?
- You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

162
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:13,771
- Okay.
- I love you, kiddo.

163
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,532
I love you, too.

164
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:31,373
Okay, here we go.

165
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:34,852
Hey, you're a competitive guy.

166
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,572
That's intimidating,
especially in a father figure.

167
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:40,053
Okay, first of all,
I'm not her father figure.

168
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,892
I'm her father.
And she's the one that's intimidating.

169
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:45,253
- What?
- Honestly. She just stares at me!

170
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:46,373
Or through me.

171
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,093
She's got this imaginary world
that she goes to

172
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:53,053
with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida.
I don't get it.

173
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:55,613
Look, I'm gonna put this
as gently as possible, okay?

174
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:56,893
You're a complete idiot.

175
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,653
You feel out of control
and you project that onto her.

176
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:03,134
Hey, look, man.
Be my friend and be my client.

177
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,773
But don't be Mr. Mystic Man
or whatever that is you call yourself.

178
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,253
- Man Whisperer.
- The Man Whisperer.

179
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:10,094
John Strother, former cornerback
for the Denver Broncos,

180
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:12,214
is now known as the "Man Whisperer. "

181
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:14,534
- That's right.
- You be whispering to men.

182
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:18,054
Look, all I'm saying is that we all
have a little kid inside, right here.

183
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,654
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And he's whispering.

184
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:21,375
Stop. Please. Stop. Stop!

185
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,414
If you don't whisper to little Evan,

186
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,735
- you'll never get through to Olivia!
- I'm not whispering to little Evan

187
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:25,895
- and I'm not whispering with you.
- You just did.

188
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,375
No, I wasn't.
No, I wasn't whispering with you.

189
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,455
I was whispering on the other...

190
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:30,255
You was finished talking,
and then I said "whisper" after.

191
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,335
I wasn't whispering with you.

192
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,575
Little Evan?
What's wrong with little Evan?

193
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,415
Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little
Evan," one more time. Say it again.

194
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,055
- You know what's gonna happen?
- What's gonna happen? What?

195
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:39,655
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna crash your portfolio.

196
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,976
What's that have to do with anything?

197
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,456
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

198
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:53,216
- You wear him out?
- No, but Olivia will.

199
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,416
- Where are they at?
- Upstairs. Princess dress-up.

200
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,776
What? They started without me?

201
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:02,536
- Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs.
- Thanks. Thanks for watching her.

202
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,376
Absolutely. Anytime.

203
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:08,097
And Trish told me to remind you,
vaccinations on Thursday.

204
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:10,776
- Okay.
- And Ella's party is Friday.

205
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,737
It's a sleepover here,
so pack all of her stuff.

206
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:15,657
And the Fall Sing is Saturday.

207
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,537
Livvy's really nervous,
so go through her songs with her.

208
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,577
She doesn't think I'm gonna
remember all this, does she?

209
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,698
No. She does not.

210
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,898
Oh, no. Come on, guys.

211
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,857
More! I want to be beautiful!

212
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,217
Hey, Ev.

213
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,818
I've got the perfect size seat
for little Evan.

214
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,898
- Come, sit down.
- I think I'm fine. I'm okay.

215
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,379
Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go.

216
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,259
- Bye, Olivia.
- Bye, Ella.

217
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,658
- Bye, Liv.
- Bye.

218
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,779
Denver Broncos, huh?

219
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,379
No, Mopida, I can't go.

220
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,180
No.

221
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,019
Well, yeah.

222
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,860
Are you sure, Mopida?

223
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,340
Okay, if you say so.

224
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,941
What? He actually had a snake?
A real snake?

225
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:21,820
Nobody's gonna fall
for this whole shtick.

226
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:25,260
What we have to do is find
a better way to do this, all right?

227
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:26,340
No, no, listen.

228
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:29,021
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eliminate TriTek.

229
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:30,581
No, no, no, no.
Look, I'm looking at the specs here,

230
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,301
and I don't like what I see. First of...

231
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,021
Hold on a second.

232
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:38,861
Olivia, what are you doing?
Go back to bed.

233
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:42,341
- You said you'd be a king.
- I said I'd do what?

234
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:47,101
You said last time that next time
you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king.

235
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,021
Well, I don't recall saying that.
I don't remember saying that.

236
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,221
And even if I did say that,

237
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:52,182
I don't have the right stuff
to do king stuff here.

238
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,702
I don't have any king clothes,
and I don't have a king hat.

239
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,302
It's called a crown.

240
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,862
- Evan, you there?
- Hold on a second.

241
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,582
Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed.

242
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,702
I will sleep in here.

243
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:02,982
No, you're sleeping in your room.
That's why you have a bedroom.

244
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,622
- You go sleep in your bedroom.
- I do not want to sleep in there.

245
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,863
All right. You're gonna go to sleep?
You promise?

246
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,423
Go over there and lay down. Be quiet,
Olivia. I have to work here, all right?

247
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:17,983
I'm sorry, man. Where was I?
What was I saying?

248
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,263
Listen, this is where
we're gonna snake Whitefeather.

249
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:22,463
'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go
for the obvious play, Solocom.

250
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:25,864
But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber.
Digital Fiber is the play.

251
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:28,103
- That's the obvious choice.
- Stop saying...

252
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,863
Hold on a second.

253
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,864
- Olivia.
- What?

254
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:36,625
Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look.
No, no, no.

255
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,984
You gotta be quiet.

256
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,584
It's his job, not yours.

257
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,465
Can I call you back? Thank you.

258
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,785
All right, that's it.

259
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,225
Now, I asked you to be quiet,
but you don't listen.

260
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,064
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

261
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,865
I asked you not to talk,
but you kept talking.

262
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,065
You don't know how to listen,
so since you don't know how to listen,

263
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,786
you take your blanket
and you go in your room. Go.

264
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:04,625
Come on now.

265
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:05,825
Come on, come on, really, please.

266
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:09,146
Come on, please. I'm saying, "Please. "
Go to bed, please.

267
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,067
Now what?

268
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:23,507
What is it?

269
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:28,226
Look, I told you,
I will play king with you some other time.

270
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:31,187
Daddy has a lot of work to do.
All right? So...

271
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,667
What?

272
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,268
I do listen.

273
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,429
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,709
How many days till I go back home?

275
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,589
I've gone over everything we talked
about last night, and it all looks great.

276
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,749
That's perfect, because
Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom.

277
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,510
- Of course.
- But we got a better alternative.

278
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,629
- Digital Fiber.
- Got a good record.

279
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,989
Exactly.
I'm gonna call you in 20 minutes,

280
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,509
- right after I drop Olivia off to school.
- Very nice.

281
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,909
All right. Okay.

282
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,910
Come on, honey. Let's get going.
Daddy's sort of in a hurry.

283
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:40,630
I think this milk is spoiled.

284
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,550
No. That's not possible,
because I checked this milk.

285
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:45,190
Come on, let's go! Let's go.

286
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:06,231
What if we say
we just get a muffin, huh?

287
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,471
Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?

288
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,231
Honey, I don't know
if I have the right stuff for that,

289
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,871
- you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.
- I can help you.

290
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,712
I got a better idea.
How about we leave a note for Graciella,

291
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,192
she can make some pancakes,
put them in the freezer,

292
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:18,191
we'll thaw them out
and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah.

293
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:21,032
- Not what I was thinking.
- Move! Let's move!

294
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:24,592
Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music.

295
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,032
Okay, your Fall Sing...
Where is that stuff?

296
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:31,353
Okay, here it is! Right here.
Right here's your music.

297
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:34,832
Rick?

298
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,193
- I thought you said you were in a hurry.
- Yeah. I'm coming right now.

299
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:47,154
Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough.

300
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,913
Hey, does Mommy ever make
a new friend, you know, in like a...

301
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,953
- You mean Rick?
- Yes, Rick.

302
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:58,553
Is that the guy from Mommy's work with
the spiked hair and the pointed face?

303
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:01,594
"Hello, I'd like to talk to you
for a sec". That guy?

304
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,553
No, that's Skip. Rick is tall.

305
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,995
Handsome, too.
He looks like Prince Charming.

306
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,995
Good for Rick.

307
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:13,954
- Morning, Graciella.
- Morning, Mr. Danielson.

308
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,474
- Hi, Graciella.
- Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you.

309
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,235
Hey, Graciella! One thing.

310
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:21,115
Can you please make some pancakes
and put them in the freezer for us?

311
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,555
Thank you so much. All right.

312
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,595
Hey, what are you, a button maniac?
Stop it.

313
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:27,196
Press one floor and leave it alone.

314
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,075
Daddy?

315
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,915
Kupida wanted me to tell you something.

316
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,555
Yeah. Go ahead.

317
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:37,596
She heard what you were saying
on the phone last night,

318
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,795
and she told me to tell you
she doesn't like either of them.

319
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:42,835
Which guy? Rick or Skip?

320
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:46,596
The companies,
Solocom and Digital Fiber.

321
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:51,556
Kupida doesn't like them,
neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees.

322
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,557
Daddy, do you know
why they don't like them?

323
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:58,277
Daddy, I said,
do you know why they don't like them?

324
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,556
- Why?
- Because they're broken.

325
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:04,076
- Do you know which one they do like?
- No, honey, I have no idea.

326
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:06,956
The first one,
the one you threw away, TriTek.

327
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:09,477
- Are you sure you're listening?
- Yes, Daddy sure is listening,

328
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:11,798
but come on, we got to go. Let's go.

329
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:14,797
Kupida and Mopida really like it.

330
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,877
- You know why?
- Why is that?

331
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:20,797
- Because it has buried treasure.
- Yeah? Okay.

332
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,158
- You aren't listening.
- No, no, Daddy's listening.

333
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,438
Okay, so, we're here,
and we're going in.

334
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,399
And there's something
you have to go without.

335
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,400
Hey, come on, come on,
Olivia, let's go, let's go.

336
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,079
- Liv! How are you?
- Hi!

337
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,640
- Give me five.
- Put her there. Put her there.

338
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,360
Okay, guys, I got, like,
three meetings back to back.

339
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:12,840
She's just gonna sit down here
and get settled down here.

340
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,400
Let's get settled in. All right.

341
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,440
- Mike, which one can I get rid of?
- Well...

342
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,600
That one.

343
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,201
No. You don't say that one.
That's sacrilege.

344
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:21,521
That's Dante D'Enzo.
We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo.

345
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:25,000
- Kupida says he's boring.
- Well, Kupida is estÃºpida.

346
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,600
Because he happens to be one of
the greatest investors on the planet.

347
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,321
- No, he's boring.
- No, no.

348
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,880
Why am I standing here
arguing with you about Kupida?

349
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:33,281
Let me get something for you to watch.

350
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,681
There you go. There's the...
What's that? Barney.

351
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:38,161
Okay, look, can you watch my kid for
me? You have my back for me, Mike?

352
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:40,322
Watch that Barney and I'll be...

353
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,482
That's not Barney. That's Blue.

354
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:48,002
And now I'm going to tap
your knee very gently...

355
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,362
Did you see that?

356
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:52,281
...by increasing your family's holdings
in optical fiber.

357
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:55,402
If you take a look at these charts here
on page six in your folders...

358
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,123
Granted, Solocom looks solid,

359
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:07,962
but if you pore over the financials,
it's crystal clear,

360
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,483
the smart play here is Digital Fiber.

361
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:13,643
- Kupida says no.
- Okay.

362
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,003
- No.
- Let's move on Digital Fiber.

363
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:18,643
I'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber?

364
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:21,764
Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No.

365
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:25,044
- No?
- Yes. Yes, go, yes.

366
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,204
- Mother?
- Tom?

367
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,204
Johnny?
Perhaps you have something to add?

368
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:39,684
Not really. It's good work from Evan.
Digital Fiber. Solocom.

369
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,364
I struggled with it myself last night.

370
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,484
I went to sleep convinced
I was gonna take

371
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:47,604
the Pressman family towards
that pretty face, Solocom.

372
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:51,725
But in the middle of the night,
the dream sparrow comes to me.

373
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,205
She taps me on the forehead and says,
"Wake up, handsome brave.

374
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:58,245
"There's something happening
in Uzbekistan. "

375
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,605
"Uzbeka-what?

376
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:03,005
"It's 4:30 in the morning, little friend.
I'm sleeping. "

377
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:08,246
But she said there's a kalacampi,
the worm hidden in the apple.

378
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,486
And I let the dream sparrow fly away.

379
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,246
- The dream sparrow.
- But I investigated what she said

380
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:18,246
on the white fire grid
you people call the Internet.

381
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:21,006
At 4:15 this morning,
Mountain Standard Time,

382
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,326
the Uzbeki government
followed through on a series of threats

383
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:27,367
to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom.

384
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:29,927
Digital Fiber, Solocom,

385
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:34,167
all of their underground cabling
that they were relying upon,

386
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,967
lost in that mushroom cloud.
Do I blame Uzbekistan? No.

387
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,007
Defend yourself, mountain republic,
just like you said you would.

388
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,848
You followed through.

389
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,687
But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan,

390
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:52,288
a little company called TriTek,
didn't look like much to me yesterday,

391
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:57,568
but today, their 6,000 miles of
already-buried underground cabling,

392
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:03,169
looking a lot more valuable.
TriTek, baby. I say we go into TriTek.

393
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,329
- Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh?
- Okay.

394
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,688
Evan, you mind if I sit in on your 11:00?

395
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,889
Well, Johnny, that's not up to me.
That's up to the client.

396
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,129
So it's cool?

397
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,048
Because I checked with the client,
and they said it's okay.

398
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:21,248
That's great. That's great.

399
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,929
Hey, ain't nothing but a thing.

400
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,570
The herd moves on, but you're
gonna be fine, little elk.

401
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,850
You're gonna be just fine.
One sky, man.

402
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,730
One sky.

403
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,970
I didn't realize you guys were so tight.

404
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:42,210
You know what I want you to do
for me, Tod?

405
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,650
Go down to legal
and check something out for me. Okay?

406
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,090
I want to know
what the ramifications are

407
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,011
if I were to stab Johnny Whitefeather.

408
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,011
- Daddy!
- Not now, sweetie.

409
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,770
- But, Daddy!
- Hey, not now.

410
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:59,930
And listen to me, Liv.
This is where Daddy works.

411
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:01,691
You cannot come down here
and stand outside my meetings

412
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:03,692
and flail your arms around.

413
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:07,411
- Rose!
- Yeah.

414
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:11,051
Can you take Olivia downstairs
and get her a muffin or something?

415
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:12,691
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

416
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,572
I don't think she's hungry.

417
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,691
She's starving. I can see that.

418
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,891
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go get a muffin.

419
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:21,132
Have some girl talk.

420
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:27,692
- Hey, Ev.
- Hey, give me a second, Noah.

421
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:30,252
I'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00.

422
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:34,733
Actually, it pertains to the 11:00.
Quickly, two things.

423
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:39,373
First, Johnny has just asked me
to join his tribe.

424
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:44,013
I can't believe it.
He actually calls his team a tribe.

425
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:46,734
Yeah, it's stupid.

426
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:51,373
- And you said yes, didn't you?
- No, no, absolutely not, at first.

427
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:53,134
But then he put
so much pressure on me.

428
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,213
He needed an answer immediately. So...

429
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:58,414
It's all well and good, Noah.
But thanks for your loyalty, all right.

430
00:23:58,414 --> 00:24:01,294
Now if you don't mind, I gotta get ready
in about 10 minutes, so if you'd be so...

431
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:05,214
That's the other thing.
About the 11:00, Johnny moved it up.

432
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:06,814
He had a conflict at 11:00.

433
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:09,134
Johnny moved my meeting
with my clients?

434
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,254
Yeah. It started at 10:30,

435
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:16,054
so I popped in here as a courtesy to you,
because we were so tight for so long.

436
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,775
And thank you so much for hiring me.

437
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:21,295
- Out!
- Okay, I gotta go.

438
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,015
Rose!

439
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:27,815
Where are my notes for the 11:00?

440
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:30,935
- Sorry. I think they're in there.
- They're not in there.

441
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:41,576
Mr. D, I talked to the lawyer guy upstairs
and he confirmed my hunch

442
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:45,776
about the whole stabbing
Mr. Whitefeather thing.

443
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,097
It's a definite no-can-do
from a legal standpoint.

444
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:54,617
- Go away, Tod. Go very far away.
- Yes. Right.

445
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,816
I can't find them.

446
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:01,096
Well, they're here somewhere, Rose.

447
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,617
Please, I can't make it happen
without my notes.

448
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,336
- Find my notes. Please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

449
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,137
All of a sudden, I'm late for a meeting
that I was early for in the first place.

450
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,897
All right. It's all right.
We're gonna find them.

451
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:17,778
Oh, my God.

452
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,538
Did you draw on my worksheets?

453
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:22,578
- Qwali said I could.
- Qwali said you could?

454
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:24,498
Qwali said you could.
But let me tell you something, Olivia.

455
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:26,218
I'm getting ready to go into
a meeting with grown people.

456
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:27,458
They're gonna be judging Daddy,

457
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,218
and all of a sudden,
my worksheets have

458
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:32,098
pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff

459
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,578
and, what is this,
people kissing or something?

460
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,259
Kupida says they might get married.

461
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,338
And why is this sticky?
Why is this so sticky?

462
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:41,698
It's sparkle glue. Sparkly.

463
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,619
This is a disaster.

464
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,659
- A horror show.
- Live.

465
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,339
Love. Laugh. Walahala!

466
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,461
Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala!

467
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:16,341
I have never, guys,
I have never felt so jazzed

468
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:20,981
about the prospects of our pension fund!
I mean it. I am jazzed!

469
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:22,860
I wish I could take credit, Fred,

470
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:26,100
but we gotta give that to the Walahala,
Mr. Waterfall.

471
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,821
Hey, rain down prosperity!

472
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:32,501
- And how.
- Thank you, Johnny!

473
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:41,341
Evan. Everybody,
you remember Evan Danielson.

474
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:44,501
I would hope so, after seven years
of working with you guys.

475
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,742
Yeah. Of course.
How's it going there, Evan?

476
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:50,462
Good to see you. Hey, look,
while we were waiting for you,

477
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:55,743
Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather
radical suggestions, as you can see.

478
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:56,982
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:00,783
So what do you think, Evan?
You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here,

480
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:05,782
or do you have some special insight
that you'd like to share with us about

481
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:08,264
how you would increase the fund?

482
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:12,744
I think I do have some insight.
I don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather.

483
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,103
What I was gonna suggest was...

484
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,624
a 4% reallocation
away from convertible arbitrage.

485
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:28,344
And in addition

486
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:34,263
to that...

487
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,865
Okay. Good. Thank you.

488
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:40,664
I don't know about you guys,
but this is good for me.

489
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:42,024
Didn't I tell you he was good?

490
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,425
Hey, man.

491
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:46,185
Sometimes the best spear
is the one you don't throw.

492
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,105
Ain't nothing but a thing.

493
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,905
"Ain't nothing but a thing. "
What does that even mean, Johnny?

494
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,945
It's not a thing, but it is?
It's something, but it's not a thing?

495
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:02,425
But it's not. But it's something.
What is... I'm confused! What's that?

496
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:05,626
You're a seeker, brother crow.
You should ride that...

497
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:07,225
You know what? Stop it right now.
Stop it!

498
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:08,386
Because I'm not gonna be
subjected to your...

499
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,706
Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas
stuff today.

500
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:13,946
"One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!"

501
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,506
Evan, that's shadow time. Okay.
Let's keep that in the shadows.

502
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,506
Oh, no. Please, please, please,
make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

503
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:24,226
Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord.
Why are you falling for this?

504
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:26,266
What's the matter? I've been
working for you for seven years.

505
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,267
And you know that, Fred!
I went to your grandson's birthday party,

506
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:31,466
and I went to Aspen with you
and your wife for the whole weekend.

507
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:32,586
We got history together.

508
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,987
You gonna throw it all away because
this guy showed you some waterfalls

509
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:36,347
and got you chanting "Walla Walla"?

510
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,867
Evan, we're always looking for fresh
ideas, and he showed us some.

511
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,188
It's like Johnny says.

512
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:46,108
You got turtles that live in their shell
and turtles that live out of their shell.

513
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,748
What? What? What did you just say?

514
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,788
What did he say? Johnny just said...
What did he tell you?

515
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,548
What was that?
What did he say? What?

516
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,748
He said turtles with no shell...

517
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:55,629
Called geckos, man.

518
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,388
That's not even biology!

519
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:01,828
How could you listen...
What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake?

520
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,108
You want new ideas?
Special new ideas. Okay.

521
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,669
'Cause slow, predictable growth
is so boring.

522
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,909
Let's talk about... Let's talk about
a little company called ChemStar.

523
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,148
Let's talk about this company.
I say go out and buy lots of it.

524
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,828
Buy lots and lots of ChemStar.
You know why? Because it's sparkly.

525
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:17,469
Everybody knows that
everybody loves sparkly things,

526
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,509
so go out and buy some ChemStar
because it's sparkly!

527
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,189
Okay. Here's fresh new idea
number two.

528
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,709
These companies were so stinky
I had to snip them all away.

529
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,709
Snip! Snip! Snip!
If you're not good, you got to go!

530
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,069
Okay.
Here's fresh new idea number three!

531
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,109
Look at that.
You got YellowFin and AeroDyne.

532
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,950
What are they doing?
YellowFin and AeroDyne.

533
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:38,591
They're kissing.
And what does kissing usually lead to?

534
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:43,070
Marriage! They're getting married!

535
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:48,271
YellowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree
K- I-S-S-I-N-G

536
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:50,591
First comes love, come on
Then comes marriage...

537
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,751
- Evan. Stop.
- No, don't stop me.

538
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:57,391
I got more. I got more, Tom!
Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne.

539
00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:58,791
NeoDyne,
that's your biggest holding, right?

540
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,391
6% of your equity is in NeoDyne.

541
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:02,591
You know what fresh new thinking has
to say about that company?

542
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,191
Pull out! Pull out now. You know why?

543
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,111
Because NeoDyne is about
to have his pants pulled down

544
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:07,911
and have his underwear exposed.
Know what's in the underwear?

545
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:09,832
- No.
- Poop.

546
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:11,631
Poop is in the underwear.

547
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:14,872
Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca.
So here's a recap.

548
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:17,392
NeoDyne, pants pulled down,
butt exposed,

549
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:19,672
poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay?

550
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,272
Those are my fresh new...
You take this. You hold on to it.

551
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,232
So those are my new ideas.
Thank you so much!

552
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:28,353
Raining down!
Fresh ideas and Walla Walla!

553
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:40,273
- Did you tell them what Kupida said?
- Yeah. I sure did.

554
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:42,273
Did they like it?

555
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,114
I imagine it was
a lot of fun to watch, honey.

556
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:52,274
Oh, God. What have I done?
What have I done?

557
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,674
Is everything okay?

558
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:05,115
Hey, Ev?

559
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:08,675
Stevens wants to see you. Yeah.

560
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:33,836
- He just kind of flipped out.
- He lost it, man. He lost it.

561
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:36,876
Look, whatever you heard I said,
it's probably a lot worse.

562
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:40,796
- I heard you said poop.
- Yeah, I said poop. Twice.

563
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:42,396
Nice.

564
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:47,076
I will be back in as much time

565
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:50,156
as it officially takes to say,
"You're fired," all right?

566
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,798
Evan, what...

567
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,077
Tom, I don't know what...

568
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,518
I'm still trying to process
what just happened in there.

569
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,757
So am I, too. Really, Tom.

570
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:21,318
How did you know
about all those things?

571
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,718
Listen to me, Tom. There's... What?

572
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,838
The two companies
you said were kissing.

573
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,158
AeroDyne and YellowFin.

574
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,878
- What did you mean by that?
- I just...

575
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,519
My brother-in-law
sits on the board ofAeroDyne.

576
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,439
For 18 months, they've been looking for
a partner to offset their overseas debt.

577
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,838
Of the literally
700 companies considered,

578
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,239
there's only one whose financials
actually made sense,

579
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,759
and that's YellowFin.

580
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,959
Now, how did you know
about this impending marriage?

581
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,400
- I just...
- Kupida said they might get married.

582
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:58,640
ChemStar.
You said to buy because it was sparkly.

583
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,360
Yes?

584
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:03,720
- Yeah, okay...
- A data-wire

585
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:08,760
came in during the meeting.
During the meeting.

586
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,200
"ChemStar finalizes plans to expand

587
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:13,800
"bauxite excavation
in its New Guinea mine.

588
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:17,041
"Stock up 18%."

589
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:18,480
Bauxite.

590
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,800
It's sparkle glue.

591
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,561
- Sparkly.
- Sparkly.

592
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,921
NeoDyne. You said to get out.
Do you remember why?

593
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,721
- Do you?
- Yes.

594
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:30,762
I wrote this down.

595
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:36,001
"Because their pants
were coming down,

596
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:38,081
"and everyone was going to see
their underwear,

597
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,442
"which was filled with poop".

598
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,002
Yeah, I remember that.

599
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:46,522
Lunchtime today, they were exposed
by the SEC for corporate fraud.

600
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:51,562
Pants pulled down.
And their books? Total poop!

601
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,643
So I'm asking you again.

602
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,363
How did you know all of this?

603
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:03,483
- Are you insider trading?
- No. No, Tom. No way, never.

604
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:05,403
Then what are you doing?

605
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:09,884
Where are you getting this information?

606
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:15,884
- So it's the goo-gaa?
- That's how I go there.

607
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:17,443
What do you mean you go there?
Go where?

608
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,043
- To where the princesses live.
- Right. The princesses.

609
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:22,763
That's Kupida and Qwali
and all of them, right?

610
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:24,044
Qwali's a queen.

611
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,404
Kupida, Mopida and Sopida
are princesses.

612
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,644
- Okay, got you.
- How many times do I have to tell you?

613
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:31,524
Right. Right.
Okay, let me get this right now.

614
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:35,245
Now, they tell you things
about companies?

615
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,085
Well, you know what,
I got a couple of other companies

616
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:43,244
I want you to ask them about.
Do you think they'll be up to that?

617
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:45,165
You can do it yourself.

618
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,005
I can ask them myself.
I can go there with you?

619
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,245
Yes, it'll be fun.

620
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,205
Okay.

621
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,165
A little more room here.

622
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,245
- Now, I do what now?
- Okay.

623
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:01,605
- I take the goo-gaa.
- You hold it up to your face.

624
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:05,246
- Hold it up to my face.
- And rub in little circles.

625
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:08,126
- OK, I'm doing it in little circles. OK.
- Like this.

626
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,646
Now you put it over your head, like this.

627
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:13,086
Okay. Now what?

628
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:17,806
And you kind of call them in your mind
while you spin around in circles.

629
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:20,607
Okay. So I call to them in my mind
while I spin in a circle.

630
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:23,647
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm spinning. I'm spinning.

631
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:27,447
Keep spinning. Keep spinning.

632
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,047
I'm spinning around.

633
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,367
Are you calling them in your mind?

634
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,207
Yeah.

635
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,207
Okay. So am I supposed to just
keep spinning and spinning around?

636
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,168
'Cause I'm a tad bit nauseous now.

637
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,528
Okay, we're there!

638
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,249
Isn't it beautiful?

639
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:06,569
Come on, Daddy!
This way, into the forest!

640
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,929
Wow. The princesses
sure live in a beautiful forest.

641
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,529
No, because this part's all burned.

642
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,809
Yes, burned from a big forest fire.

643
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,849
No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all.

644
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,409
Sopida has a dragon?

645
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,409
And if you want to get past her,
you have to sing a song she likes.

646
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,210
I gotta sing a song
to Sopida's dragon, too?

647
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,450
- Hurry. She's coming!
- What? She's coming where?

648
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,490
Sing.

649
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:40,130
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

650
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,490
Sopida's dragon

651
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,891
You gotta do better than that.

652
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:51,091
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

653
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,211
Try higher.

654
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:56,651
Sopida's dragon, please let...

655
00:36:56,652 --> 00:36:59,331
- Higher, like a mouse!
- You want me to have an aneurysm?

656
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:03,572
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

657
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:06,011
She very hates that.

658
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:08,852
- I'm with her.
- Try lower, like a frog.

659
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,853
Okay, like a frog.

660
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:15,092
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

661
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:16,332
Sopida's dragon...

662
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,572
She very likes that. She fell asleep.
Come on. Let's go.

663
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,893
Now we can go through her cave. Duck!

664
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:24,452
All right, going into the cave.
That's a big, beautiful cave we're in.

665
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,172
No, it's tiny. Can't you see?

666
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,212
Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still.
That's why...

667
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,373
Jump, Daddy! Jump!

668
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,693
- Jump? Why am I jumping? Okay.
- Jump till you get in!

669
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:33,413
Okay, you're in.

670
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:35,853
- Now you're out.
- Okay. What was I in?

671
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,453
- France!
- I was in France?

672
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:40,613
- Now, we're on the beach.
- Okay. We're on the beach now.

673
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:43,414
All right. Great! Is it a nice beach here?

674
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,973
Only 'cause mermaids give us
popcorn balls.

675
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:50,574
That's so nice.
Thank you for the popcorn balls!

676
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:56,134
Oh, no! Someone's coming!
Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't!

677
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,494
Can't what? What happened?
What's going on?

678
00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:59,974
She doesn't trust you!
She's throwing rocks at you!

679
00:37:59,975 --> 00:38:01,494
- Why? Why...
- Duck, Daddy! Duck!

680
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:02,814
I'm ducking! But what did Daddy do?

681
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,694
Why's she throwing rocks at me?
Don't know what I did.

682
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,615
Up the path!

683
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:08,775
Go back down!

684
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,695
- This way.
- Okay.

685
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:15,255
Okay, we made it. There they are.

686
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:17,855
Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida!

687
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,255
- Hey.
- Say something nice.

688
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,655
Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you?
Good to see you.

689
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:29,015
My name is Evan Danielson,
and I'm Olivia's dad.

690
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,455
They already know who you are.

691
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,216
Okay.

692
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,496
It's good to see you.
You look so nice and pretty,

693
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:40,136
the two of you.
My, you really outdid yourself today.

694
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:43,896
I'm here to ask you. I was wondering...

695
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:48,377
- Are you sure they're...
- Yeah. They're watching.

696
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:51,897
I was gonna... I have some...

697
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:57,656
I want to ask about magnesium futures

698
00:38:57,657 --> 00:39:01,857
and their relationship to
Bolivian currency fluctuations.

699
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:07,457
Specifically, these three companies,

700
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:11,738
La Paz Ore and Iron,
and International Mining

701
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:15,098
and Weston Metallurgy Limited.

702
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,338
Weston Metallurgy.

703
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:21,738
These three. I was wondering if you...
Can they see them?

704
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:25,298
I don't want to be in your way.

705
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,418
Okay, what are they doing?
Are they talking?

706
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:28,538
- Yeah.
- What are they talking about?

707
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,299
They're talking.

708
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:37,259
Really?

709
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,579
Are you sure?

710
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,460
Okay.

711
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,099
Yes, no, no.

712
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,780
Did they give a reason?

713
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,019
- Because it's fancy?
- That's exactly right, sir. Fancy.

714
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,820
But you're also saying, and this is
what strikes me as contradictory,

715
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,339
that we should abandon
all interests in Weston Metallurgy.

716
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,260
- That's correct.
- Because the boliviano is gonna...

717
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:01,500
What did he say again?

718
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:04,380
"Be a big, dumb showoff
and fall off its bike. "

719
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:07,820
No. Trike.
And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff.

720
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,820
Well, no offense, son,
but sounds to me like

721
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,900
a load of what you just stepped in.

722
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,460
Well, that's why we brought
Mr. Whitefeather along, right?

723
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:15,501
What you got, son?

724
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:18,381
Mr. Rowe, that's funny.

725
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:23,542
The country's entire monetary system
reduced to riding around on a tricycle.

726
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:28,462
That's a laugh. It's good to laugh.
It's good to laugh, man.

727
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:31,462
But there's a time to be serious.

728
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:35,542
We're out here in these holy mountains
that we call Rocky.

729
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:38,942
They're full of predator, prey.

730
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:43,742
The lion of the mountain
knows when to pounce.

731
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:47,422
Better watch out, jack-bunny...

732
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:50,543
- Excuse me, one moment.
- Yeah, okay.

733
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:58,262
Love the new act, man.

734
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:00,744
- Fun character.
- Thank you.

735
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,543
You know, there's an old tribal saying,

736
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:05,343
"It's not the paint
that makes the warrior. "

737
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:09,064
- What?
- Be well, brother. Be well.

738
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,823
Evan, I ever tell you
about Billy Littlesnake,

739
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:14,944
a guy I used to go fishing with
in Montana?

740
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:17,623
I think you spared me that story.

741
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,503
He'd go fishing
where nobody else fished

742
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:22,304
and always come back with 10 fat trout.

743
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,103
Turned out he was stopping off
at the market and buying them.

744
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:27,023
I'm not insider trading,
if that's what you're saying.

745
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:30,464
Whoa, come on. Let's don't go
into those woods. All right?

746
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:33,784
- There's a lot of bear in those woods.
- Hey, listen. Stop that thing.

747
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,144
If you're gonna talk to me,
don't do that thing you do.

748
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,345
You want me to speak directly?
I can do that.

749
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:40,105
Then do it.

750
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:43,025
You want to run with me, Evan,
then run with me.

751
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,745
I accept the challenge. I welcome it.

752
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:50,305
But if I find out that you're stopping off
at the market and buying your fat trout,

753
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:51,465
I'm gonna scalp you.

754
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,705
You're gonna scalp me. Literally?

755
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:56,226
It's gonna feel literal, yeah.

756
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:58,946
Nice chatting with you, Johnny.

757
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,625
And you, Evan.

758
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:04,746
Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay.

759
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:08,106
Let me tell you something
about Johnny Whitefeather.

760
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:11,627
Under all the show,
I'm good at what I do.

761
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,426
I have a gift. I see trends.

762
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:16,866
I see patterns.
I see things no one else will ever see.

763
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,067
Evan is good, but he's not that good.

764
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:22,787
I want you to find out
where he's getting his information.

765
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:29,467
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

766
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,147
- She's in a good mood tonight.
- That's great.

767
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,587
We're all in a good mood.
Let's go through the cave then!

768
00:42:33,588 --> 00:42:34,667
Let's get in the cave,
going through the cave.

769
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,227
Ducking down!
It's a little above my head in the cave.

770
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:39,548
And now we're coming out in France.
We're in France!

771
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,227
All right.
And now we're back on the beach again.

772
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,348
On the wonderful beach
with Kupida and Mopida.

773
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:47,068
Hello, Kupida and Mopida!
How are the princesses today?

774
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:49,388
- They're good.
- They're good. That's great.

775
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:50,948
That's great.
Hold on to this for a second, honey.

776
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:51,988
- Yeah.
- Okay, now.

777
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,588
Ladies, I want to talk to you
about something.

778
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:56,548
First, let me tell you that those gowns
you're wearing look exquisite.

779
00:42:56,549 --> 00:42:58,629
They look exquisite, ladies.

780
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:02,908
I'll just go right out and say it.
Am I looking in the right direction here?

781
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:04,229
- Yeah.
- Okay.

782
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,749
I have a potential client
who is in the medical field

783
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,869
and he has a particular company.

784
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,709
He was wondering if
he should hold on to that company.

785
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,349
And I was wondering if you ladies
had any feelings about that.

786
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,309
The company is called VallaTech.

787
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,629
I've just been hearing
so many incredible things about it.

788
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,670
We were just wondering
what you princesses thought.

789
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:25,710
- What do they think?
- Maybe.

790
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,870
Maybe?

791
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:34,150
Because Kupida very liked it,
and Mopida very hated it.

792
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:35,550
Okay, so, now what do we do?

793
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,031
If they disagree, we have to see Qwali,
but she's at her mountain castle.

794
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:44,991
Okay. Well,
where's the mountain castle?

795
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,791
There.

796
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:52,551
Now, does Qwali have to be out
by this bridge in front of my building,

797
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:54,591
all these people all over the place,
where everybody can see us?

798
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,071
We are not by a bridge.

799
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:57,791
We're at the bottom of
Qwali's mountain!

800
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,911
And there's no one here
except you and me,

801
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:02,911
and maybe Qwali,
if she likes the way you dance.

802
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,752
Dance? I have to dance for Qwali, too?

803
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:08,712
Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight,
and she has to see who is the best king.

804
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:11,673
And she will not talk until she does.

805
00:44:12,872 --> 00:44:17,433
Okay. Well, let's do a little dance
for Qwali, then.

806
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:20,752
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

807
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:22,313
How are you...

808
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,473
- Okay. How's that?
- Horrible.

809
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:30,513
You have to get on that thing,
so she can see you.

810
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:33,032
Hey, look. I'm not getting up
on the stage, all right?

811
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,673
She won't talk to you.

812
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,194
Okay, I'm gonna go get up on the stage.

813
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,914
Oh, come on! She can't see that!
She's way, way up there.

814
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:54,195
Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here.

815
00:44:58,515 --> 00:45:00,515
More! Bigger!

816
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,715
Like that? Like this? No? Yes?

817
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:06,475
To the beat! Can't you hear the music?

818
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:08,515
To the beat? I don't hear the beat.

819
00:45:08,516 --> 00:45:09,995
Check it out.

820
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,716
I hear the snickers.

821
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:16,235
It's spinning music!

822
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:20,516
- Spinning, with your arms out!
- You mean like a waltz?

823
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:24,716
Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay.

824
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:58,717
- That's the best I could do.
- No, it was good. She liked it.

825
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:01,037
You can go to the ball!

826
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,877
Okay, all right.

827
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:05,837
Qwali said it was good.
I can go to the ball.

828
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,798
Now, did you ask Qwali
how she feels about VallaTech?

829
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:14,518
Bottom line, sir,
is that VallaTech is stuck up

830
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,478
and doesn't play nice with others.
I say we cut it out.

831
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:17,598
- Really?
- Yeah.

832
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,078
I know this sounds a little unorthodox,

833
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,398
but here's something else
you need to know.

834
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,558
It has a big butt?

835
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,799
A big ol' butt with a shelf on it.

836
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,158
I think if you look at DarbaCon's
bloated end-of-the-year rollover...

837
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,638
...you'll see it has pretty hair
and all the boys are looking at it.

838
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:33,999
Well, if he said it wets the bed,
then it wets the bed.

839
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,399
What else did he say?

840
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,519
This little company goes
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

841
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,479
- Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"?
- Yes. All the way home.

842
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,599
- And people are buying that?
- By the millions.

843
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,319
Icky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky.

844
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic?

845
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,679
Not that I'm aware of.

846
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,280
It's fizzy like a soda pop.

847
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,960
- Is he a psychic?
- No, I don't believe he is.

848
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:58,839
It's old enough to start wearing makeup.

849
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,200
"Ready for makeup. " You feeling this?

850
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:04,680
He says your funds are mature,
and now it's time to start diversifying.

851
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:07,920
Specifically, for A.I.,
what I'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini.

852
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:09,840
- I'm feeling that.
- Hey, I want some of that.

853
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:10,960
Back off, dawg. It's mine.

854
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,321
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough
lip gloss to go around for everybody.

855
00:47:14,322 --> 00:47:18,921
Agroco is a crybaby who always
goes running to Mommy.

856
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,801
- That's your analysis.
- Yes, it is.

857
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:23,121
- And you recommend I...
- Sell.

858
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:25,481
- Sell the crybaby.
- Sell the crybaby.

859
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:26,961
Is this some kind ofjoke, Tom?

860
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:29,321
- No, Carl. It's not.
- Because it seems...

861
00:47:29,322 --> 00:47:31,481
- I know, a little different.
- A little?

862
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,762
Why don't we hear
what Mr. Whitefeather has to say?

863
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,402
Yes. Johnny, would you like to

864
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:40,202
toss some spear at some tatonka,
or cast some venison into the potlatch?

865
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:43,362
No, I wouldn't.
I'd like to take this seriously.

866
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:45,603
There's a great deal of money
at stake here, Mr. Simons.

867
00:47:45,604 --> 00:47:48,842
I think that you should move forward
on Agroco, aggressively.

868
00:47:48,843 --> 00:47:50,482
Increase your holdings.

869
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,522
And a gentleman
by the name of Dante D'Enzo...

870
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:57,763
happens to concur with my position.
His company, D.D.E. Investments,

871
00:47:57,764 --> 00:48:01,563
is looking to increase
their holdings by 25%.

872
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:05,963
So I think if we're gonna make a move,
we have to do it rather quickly.

873
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:08,883
If you're ready, I'm ready.
Let's make some money.

874
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:12,563
That's my "venison".

875
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:15,644
Evan? Your thoughts?

876
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:22,724
Well, I think that's interesting.
I think that's very interesting.

877
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,484
Very, very, very interesting...

878
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:28,244
that Dante D'Enzo would say in
and I would say out.

879
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:30,445
That's interesting, I think.

880
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:32,885
What I'm gonna do now
is I'm gonna go to the restroom,

881
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:35,245
and I'm gonna think this through,
and I'm gonna re-crunch some numbers

882
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,685
and get right back to you,
gentlemen. Excuse me.

883
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:39,885
So...

884
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:51,765
These look great.

885
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,285
Evan?

886
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:58,205
- Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?
- Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing.

887
00:48:58,206 --> 00:48:59,845
We're on lunch,
so I'm just dropping them off.

888
00:48:59,846 --> 00:49:02,206
- Hey, how you doing? I'm Rick.
- Rick.

889
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,006
Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten.

890
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,126
Yeah, so you're Rick.
You're the sculpture, sculptor.

891
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:09,926
I saw your little thing that you did
at the Comerica building.

892
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:12,086
- Yeah.
- Very metallic and pointy.

893
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:13,527
And unfairly criticized, I might add.

894
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:15,886
Look, I got some last-minute
parenting thing I gotta do with Olivia.

895
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:17,966
Nice meeting you, Rick.

896
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,846
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt. It's Mr. Danielson.

897
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:20,966
- Can I talk to Olivia for one second?
- Sure.

898
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:22,687
I'll be brief. Olivia,
come talk to Daddy, please?

899
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:23,767
Hi, everybody.

900
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:27,167
I have some quick questions for Qwali
about Agroco. Where should we go?

901
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:28,287
Come on. Come on. Come on.

902
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,967
Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa?
All right. Okay.

903
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,768
I knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect,
perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles.

904
00:49:34,769 --> 00:49:38,007
I smell something burning.
It's Sopida's dragon! Here she is!

905
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,128
Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you!
Time to dance!

906
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,088
- That's it.
- What are they doing?

907
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,248
I have no idea.

908
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:58,688
- She's really sure?
- And she says you agree with her.

909
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,929
- I do?
- Don't you?

910
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,769
- Yeah, I guess I do, sort of.
- Okay.

911
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,169
Okay, give me a high five.

912
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,289
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

913
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,930
Put this back in. All right, tell no one!

914
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,450
So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo
is totally wrong on this.

915
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,529
Yes.

916
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,759
And your inner child says that...

917
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,969
we should completely
pull out ofAgroco.

918
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,729
Yes.

919
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,610
Okay. I think
I'm going to go with...

920
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,290
what Mr. Whitefeather
has put together here.

921
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,331
It seems better.

922
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:39,531
- I am going to have the venison.
- It's a savory meat.

923
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,411
Doctor's office.

924
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:48,050
I know you say Qwali's never wrong,
but I think we both were this time.

925
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:52,011
Ifjust Mopida says it
orjust Kupida says it,

926
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:57,772
it could be wrong.
But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong.

927
00:50:57,852 --> 00:51:00,731
Well, I think
she kind of was wrong this time.

928
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:02,932
- She was not.
- Yes, she was.

929
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:04,371
- Was not.
- Yes, she was.

930
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:06,213
Not.

931
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:08,572
Actually, not.

932
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:11,092
Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me
to say "was. "

933
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:13,212
No, she really wasn't wrong.

934
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:15,572
D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco,
which is down 12%.

935
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,453
"Agroco cries foul,
hides behind parent company. "

936
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:22,893
Crybaby runs to Mommy.

937
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:29,973
- How are you doing this?
- It's easy.

938
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:32,733
You just overlap them
and it makes a pyramid.

939
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:38,494
Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie.
Time for your shot.

940
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:44,053
You did a really good job in there.
I'm really proud of you.

941
00:51:44,054 --> 00:51:46,574
For that, we're gonna get
a special ice cream treat.

942
00:51:46,575 --> 00:51:49,014
- I cried, though.
- But you did good.

943
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:50,574
You see, when I was your age
I had to get a shot,

944
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:53,494
I was running, screaming,
"Don't stab me! Don't stab me!"

945
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:55,094
No, you wouldn't.

946
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:57,654
"Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!"

947
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:59,495
How you doing, sir? What can I get you?

948
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,695
Can we get two juice bars?

949
00:52:03,775 --> 00:52:07,255
- So, who wants pancakes for dinner?
- I do.

950
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:17,295
Yeah, that's what I say.

951
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:29,536
No, we're not gonna pour it yet.

952
00:52:29,537 --> 00:52:32,376
Put butter on it.
Gotta put a small amount of butter.

953
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:37,937
- You put too much butter.
- No, that's enough.

954
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:49,736
Looks like Sopida's dragon
got to this one.

955
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:52,217
- Hey!
- That's gonna be your stack.

956
00:52:52,218 --> 00:52:55,377
You keep going here
and I'll go set up the restaurant.

957
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:57,698
The restaurant? What restaurant?

958
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:02,578
- Allow me to tell you the specials.
- Please do.

959
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,098
Pancakes.

960
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:09,777
We have kind of burnt pancakes
and really burnt pancakes.

961
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:11,859
Okay, well, how much for the regular?

962
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:16,498
- Let me see. $3,000.
- And how much for the kind of burnt?

963
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,538
- Forty-seven cents.
- Okay, let me have the kind of burnts.

964
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:20,258
Let me have two kind of burnts, please.

965
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:22,858
Perfect. Now do we have
any condiments or anything like...

966
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,018
What do you mean by that?

967
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:27,898
You know, like syrup or some honey
or some jelly or some...

968
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:32,099
Anything that might cut the taste a bit.

969
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,580
Ketchup.

970
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:44,820
Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce.
And mustard.

971
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,260
You know, I would have just went with
chocolate sauce or honey or...

972
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:51,500
- Don't worry, it's yummier this way.
- But ketchup is...

973
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:54,381
Wow. That's enough ketchup.

974
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,100
- Now would you like chocolate sauce?
- Well, I guess so, yeah.

975
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:03,140
- You probably would prefer it.
- Yeah, wow.

976
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:05,541
Yeah, let's put a lot on.

977
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:07,820
Mustard.

978
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:11,460
Excellent choice.
Brown and yellow match perfectly.

979
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:14,500
I think it's gonna add
some mystery to the dish.

980
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,861
Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce.

981
00:54:19,302 --> 00:54:22,821
Hey, where...
What happened to the pancakes?

982
00:54:23,582 --> 00:54:25,661
There. Perfect.

983
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,701
I think we should say our grace and eat.

984
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:29,382
- Okay.
- Okay.

985
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,901
- So, you pray with Daddy now.
- Okay.

986
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,022
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

987
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:37,382
- Please protect my daddy's throat.
- Please protect my daddy's throat.

988
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:42,382
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.

989
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:43,862
- Amen.
- Amen.

990
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,223
- And now I'm gonna dig in.
- Yeah, dig in.

991
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,263
And I think it's time to ingest
this pancake and be a good...

992
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:54,503
Hey, look, it's Sopida.

993
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:57,584
She's gone.

994
00:54:58,424 --> 00:55:00,783
That's the best pancake
I ever had in my life!

995
00:55:00,784 --> 00:55:04,584
- Can I please see the bill?
- Yeah, the bill?

996
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:07,383
$400,000?
You must be out your mind, woman!

997
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:09,823
You trying to get... Tell you what!
Come back here now! Come back here!

998
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:12,224
Almost got you! Oh, my God!

999
00:55:12,585 --> 00:55:13,704
Yeah, that's a good one, too.

1000
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:15,543
Hold on, wait, wait, wait,
don't hog the picture now.

1001
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:16,783
You're gonna hog the picture.

1002
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:20,144
Wait, the picture's not right
unless Daddy's in the picture.

1003
00:55:20,145 --> 00:55:23,704
That's magic! Come on, it's late.
Okay, come on.

1004
00:55:24,865 --> 00:55:26,665
Daddy?

1005
00:55:27,185 --> 00:55:29,984
I'm scared about
the Fall Sing on Saturday.

1006
00:55:29,985 --> 00:55:32,345
What are you afraid of? Your mother
told me you were excited about it.

1007
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:36,905
Well, everybody has a solo
and mine is on the last song.

1008
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:41,825
And I start it, so if I mess up,
the whole entire song is wrecked.

1009
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:43,625
What makes you think
you're gonna mess up?

1010
00:55:43,626 --> 00:55:44,745
I can't sing.

1011
00:55:44,746 --> 00:55:46,745
- What do you mean you can't sing?
- I can't.

1012
00:55:46,746 --> 00:55:49,465
Yes, you can.
Where's the song you're gonna sing?

1013
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:51,266
Let me see.

1014
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,066
I'll put it to the right page.

1015
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:54,345
- What song is it?
- Here, this page.

1016
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,906
All right, All You Need Is Love.

1017
00:55:55,907 --> 00:55:57,346
Okay, that's a good one.
That's The Beatles.

1018
00:55:57,347 --> 00:55:58,465
Tell you what, here's what you do.

1019
00:55:58,466 --> 00:56:00,666
Come over here.
I'm gonna get you onstage here.

1020
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,186
- This is the stage.
- I thought you'd play the part.

1021
00:56:02,187 --> 00:56:04,106
No, you're gonna get on stage
and I'm gonna be in the audience.

1022
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:05,866
This is gonna be
just like you're at the play.

1023
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,786
And all the people in the audience
all came to see the show.

1024
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:09,906
We're all like, "This is great.
Well, I can't wait to see the show.

1025
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:12,427
"Who's in the show? Well, who's that?
I wonder if she can sing".

1026
00:56:12,428 --> 00:56:14,027
You've got to get ready now.
You got to get ready,

1027
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:15,786
see, 'cause everybody's watching,
everybody's watching.

1028
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:17,227
And you're gonna say...

1029
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:19,466
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1030
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:21,067
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1031
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:24,907
¶ There's nothing you can do
that can't be done ¶

1032
00:56:24,908 --> 00:56:26,027
Here's how you're singing it.

1033
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:28,467
You say it and then you take
the last word and just stretch it out.

1034
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:34,541
¶ There's nothing you can do
that can't be done ¶

1035
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:39,974
¶ There's nothing you can do
that can't be done ¶

1036
00:56:39,975 --> 00:56:42,228
Yeah... All right, now,
here's the second line.

1037
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:47,068
¶ There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung ¶

1038
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:48,268
And we go higher now.

1039
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:52,308
¶ There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung ¶

1040
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,829
A little higher though.
Higher. Higher.

1041
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,628
¶ There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung ¶

1042
00:56:56,629 --> 00:56:58,828
My baby sounds like
Minnie Riperton!

1043
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:00,549
Okay, let's drop it lower.
Let's do it like a frog.

1044
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,388
¶ There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung ¶

1045
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:04,869
Daddy, you're just doing
what I did to you.

1046
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,229
Yeah, that's right. I'm doing
what you did to me. Now let's try it.

1047
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:11,309
¶ There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung ¶

1048
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,310
See, you're doing it.
Okay, here's the next one.

1049
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:14,389
¶ There's nothing you can say ¶

1050
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,469
¶ But you can learn
how to play the game It's easy ¶

1051
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,585
¶ There's nothing you can say ¶

1052
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:20,390
¶ But you can learn
how to play the game ¶

1053
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:27,470
¶ It's easy ¶

1054
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:30,190
That's it! That's it!
You're singing!

1055
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:34,830
Take a bow! She was wonderful!

1056
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:37,071
- You're going to the top!
- Oh, stop.

1057
00:57:37,072 --> 00:57:40,231
She's going to the top!

1058
00:57:42,352 --> 00:57:44,711
"They finish reading. Olivia's mother
gives her a kiss and says,

1059
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:48,911
"'You know, you really wear me out,
but I love you anyway. '

1060
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:53,312
"Olivia gives her a kiss back and says,
'I love you anyway, too. "'

1061
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,192
There you go, sleepyhead.

1062
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,432
Hey!

1063
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:06,512
We didn't talk to the princesses tonight.

1064
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:09,552
Yeah, you know what, we didn't,
but that's okay.

1065
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:10,672
It's quite all right.

1066
00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:15,073
Well, maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1067
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:17,192
Really? On my own?

1068
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,233
Qwali says she trusts you now.

1069
00:58:22,513 --> 00:58:24,113
That's very nice of Qwali.

1070
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:27,033
Tell Qwali thanks a lot.
That means a lot to me.

1071
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:29,473
Or I could tell her myself.

1072
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:30,994
You want me to?

1073
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,434
Hey, you want me to?

1074
00:58:38,154 --> 00:58:40,514
Did you fall asleep that quick?

1075
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:12,795
I send you out to gather
pertinent information.

1076
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:13,916
You come back with this.

1077
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,755
But this is all he does.
He just hangs out with his daughter.

1078
00:59:16,756 --> 00:59:19,475
They sing and they dance
and they laugh.

1079
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,835
They're playing with a blanket.

1080
00:59:22,836 --> 00:59:25,556
The two of them with their faces buried

1081
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:28,956
in a blanket.

1082
00:59:31,797 --> 00:59:33,557
The blanket.

1083
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:39,236
- It's a wakalyapi.
- Yeah.

1084
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:44,517
He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat!

1085
00:59:44,797 --> 00:59:47,197
- Say that again?
- Wakalyapi.

1086
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:50,237
A tapestry. A weave.

1087
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,357
It's how you access a higher eye.

1088
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:56,877
My people believe it's the way
to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit.

1089
00:59:56,878 --> 01:00:00,157
- Who are you calling?
- You'll see.

1090
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:02,917
The entire Denver financial community
is talking about you.

1091
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:04,878
But as your very first client ever,

1092
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:07,638
you owe it to me to tell me
what the hell is going on.

1093
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:09,357
I told you, Maggie, I'm just listening.

1094
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,678
To the little voice that whispers to you.
Yeah, right.

1095
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:15,159
Why don't you just tell her your secret?

1096
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:20,198
- Hi. Johnny Whitefeather.
- I'm Margaret Johnson.

1097
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,719
Evan? Tell her the truth.

1098
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,919
Okay, Maggie, here's the truth.
I have a six-year-old daughter.

1099
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,759
Now, she has what you would
have to call a magic blanket.

1100
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,679
Now, with this blanket,
I can be taken and be transported

1101
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,199
to a mystical, magical place

1102
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,319
where I meet with three
invisible princesses and one queen.

1103
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,239
Incidentally, they all have
remarkable insight to investing,

1104
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,000
except for one, who mostly
wants to throw rocks at me...

1105
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:49,560
and have me burned up
by her dragon.

1106
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:52,520
A securities blanket.

1107
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:57,720
Fine, fine. Keep your secret.
Just keep me in the black.

1108
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:02,601
I can get a blanket.

1109
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,161
I can. And I'm gonna get one.

1110
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,800
I need to see you guys
in my office, please.

1111
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,594
You may have noticed
I've been doing things...

1112
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,041
a little differently
this past week,

1113
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:17,281
letting the two of you go
head-to-head a bit more than usual.

1114
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:21,561
And I know you've probably
heard the rumor, and it's true.

1115
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:24,961
There's an offer on the table,
and it's big.

1116
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:27,482
It's the kind of out
I've been looking for.

1117
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:33,482
But the buyer wants to make sure that
there's someone worthy to, well,

1118
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:37,443
to take this office. So...

1119
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:39,962
Here we go.

1120
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:44,682
Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. Investments.

1121
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,923
- You're Frederick Pratt.
- Yes. Yes, I am. Excuse me.

1122
01:01:47,924 --> 01:01:50,683
- Yes, sir.
- That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo?

1123
01:01:50,684 --> 01:01:52,603
- He's ready for you.
- Hello there.

1124
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:55,922
Mr. D'Enzo.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

1125
01:01:55,923 --> 01:01:59,403
Thank you. Have a seat, gentlemen.
This won't take long.

1126
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:02,124
I assume that Tom
has already told you about...

1127
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:08,163
- Mr. Danielson, everything okay?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

1128
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:10,524
Just had to kill the phone.
It's dead now.

1129
01:02:10,525 --> 01:02:13,164
Okay, I assume Tom
had already told you that

1130
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:16,404
he's decided to throw away
the rest of his life playing golf.

1131
01:02:16,405 --> 01:02:18,695
Which means one of you
is gonna be running...

1132
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:20,884
the western division of D.D.E.

1133
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:23,964
Now, you won't be surprised to know
that I've been reviewing your files,

1134
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:27,965
and, frankly, you're both
applying quite unorthodox methods.

1135
01:02:27,966 --> 01:02:31,805
And I don't really care, as long as you
get results, which you seem to be doing.

1136
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:33,485
But, unfortunately, gentlemen,

1137
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:36,365
there's only one chair
behind the big desk.

1138
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:39,325
So I have a decision to make,
and I'll be stopping in Denver

1139
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,965
on my way back from Beijing tomorrow
to make that decision.

1140
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,925
In the meantime,
you have approximately 17 hours

1141
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:48,006
to suss out what Mr. Pratt
is about to hand you.

1142
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:50,326
And as far as preparation is concerned,

1143
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:53,566
I'll just share with you
the best advice that I ever heard...

1144
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:01,246
No, that's not the advice.

1145
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:04,767
The advice is, if I had eight hours
to chop down a tree,

1146
01:03:04,768 --> 01:03:07,927
I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.

1147
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:10,207
- Abraham Lincoln.
- You read my book.

1148
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:13,087
- Three times, sir.
- It wasn't clear the first time?

1149
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:15,047
No, that's not what I meant.

1150
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:17,727
I think I know what you meant,
Mr. Danielson.

1151
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:20,287
All right, gentlemen,
it's 2:00 a. m. in Beijing.

1152
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:22,207
Do you know where your ax is?

1153
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,767
I'll see you tomorrow.
May the best man win.

1154
01:03:27,008 --> 01:03:30,087
These are a few of the strategies
Mr. D'Enzo is considering.

1155
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:34,048
We will require your most
detailed analysis and recommendations.

1156
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:36,128
I'll leave you with Mr. Pratt.

1157
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:40,808
Okay, page one.

1158
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:51,048
Olivia! Hey! Olivia!

1159
01:03:51,049 --> 01:03:54,568
Big night! Big, big night tonight! Hey!
Where are you?

1160
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:57,409
I want to talk to princesses
and Qwali and all your friends!

1161
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,329
Got a lot of questions!
Get to stay up late!

1162
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,329
Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you?

1163
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,889
Graciella, where is she? You picked
her up from school, didn't you?

1164
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,369
Yes, seÃ±or. Then Mrs. Trish came
and took her away.

1165
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:11,250
- What? When?
- About one hour ago.

1166
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,170
Now, why would she do that
without calling me?

1167
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:16,690
You know why? Because
I took the battery out of my phone.

1168
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,650
Hey, listen!
Hey, did Olivia leave that little blanket?

1169
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:22,370
- The goo-gaa?
- Let me check, okay, seÃ±or?

1170
01:04:22,371 --> 01:04:24,130
- Hello!
- Trish! Hey!

1171
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,291
Evan, where are you?

1172
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:28,610
Olivia called you, like, five times,
then she got upset and called me.

1173
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:30,130
And then I had to leave the pledge drive
to make sure...

1174
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:31,650
It's a long story.
I took the battery out of my phone.

1175
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:33,250
But, listen, you'll never guess
who I was just talking to.

1176
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:35,131
Not now, Evan. I'm at the party.

1177
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:37,090
- The party? What party?
- Ella's party.

1178
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:39,771
- Which you obviously forgot about.
- Forgot it. Forgot all about the party.

1179
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:42,251
Okay, listen, tell Olivia I'm gonna be
there in 20 minutes to pick her up.

1180
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:43,451
Why? I'm already here.

1181
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:45,571
Look, you did your week.
I'll just stay here...

1182
01:04:45,572 --> 01:04:47,451
and take her to Ella's
for the sleepover.

1183
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:50,772
Sleepover! No, no, no. I don't know if
a sleepover works for me tonight, Trish.

1184
01:04:50,772 --> 01:04:54,291
I actually need Olivia here with me.
Here with me and her blanket, yes.

1185
01:04:54,292 --> 01:04:55,412
Her what?

1186
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:56,812
Listen, I know this is gonna sound
a little crazy.

1187
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:58,732
I know this is gonna sound
a little wild,

1188
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:00,932
but the fact of the matter is...

1189
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:05,212
I need... I need the goo-gaa.

1190
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:07,813
I don't have a response for that, Evan.

1191
01:05:07,814 --> 01:05:09,892
- No, Trish, listen.
- I'm hanging up now.

1192
01:05:09,893 --> 01:05:12,292
- Bye.
- No, no, no, Trish, Trish, Trish!

1193
01:05:25,534 --> 01:05:28,013
Okay, if you're here
for Ella's birthday party,

1194
01:05:28,014 --> 01:05:31,213
make your way to the orange slide
and into the Kidz Only zone

1195
01:05:31,214 --> 01:05:33,294
for some Fo Fo Figgley fun.

1196
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:35,014
Olivia!

1197
01:05:36,295 --> 01:05:39,214
- Trish, you want me...
- No, I'll deal with this.

1198
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:42,654
- We'll get her.
- Olivia!

1199
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:45,574
Evan, what is going on?
What are you doing here?

1200
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,334
I know, I know. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1201
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:49,014
Look, where did she go just now?

1202
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:51,334
She went into the Kidz Only room.
What is this, Evan?

1203
01:05:51,335 --> 01:05:52,734
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1204
01:05:52,735 --> 01:05:54,415
- Hey. How we doing over here?
- What's going on? How you?

1205
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,574
I'm good.

1206
01:05:55,575 --> 01:05:58,054
Trish, do you mind helping Lori
with the cake for me?

1207
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,175
Yeah, help Lori with the cake,

1208
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:00,855
and I'm gonna do
what I was going to do.

1209
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,654
- It's my daughter's 7th birthday!
- Congratulations.

1210
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:04,815
You're gonna think
this is hilarious,

1211
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:07,135
but I got to go get Olivia's
blanket for, like, six hours.

1212
01:06:07,136 --> 01:06:09,735
- You need her blanket.
- Yes, I need her blanket.

1213
01:06:09,736 --> 01:06:11,975
I see, so that's what you're
here for, to cause a scene.

1214
01:06:11,976 --> 01:06:13,376
I'm not trying
to cause a scene at all.

1215
01:06:13,377 --> 01:06:15,655
You're making it a scene by stopping
me from going to get the blanket.

1216
01:06:15,656 --> 01:06:17,975
You should just let me go get the
blanket, and there's no scene at all.

1217
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:19,536
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- What's the problem?

1218
01:06:19,537 --> 01:06:21,817
Now we've all seen what happens
when you take Liv's blanket, right?

1219
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:22,795
Okay, that's duly noted.

1220
01:06:22,796 --> 01:06:24,856
And now is not the time
nor place for it.

1221
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:27,656
Let me explain something to you.
Let me say something.

1222
01:06:27,656 --> 01:06:29,536
What I'm gonna do
is gonna take all of 10 seconds.

1223
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:31,337
I'm gonna get the blanket,
and I'm gonna be gone.

1224
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:33,576
And that's the end of the deal,
you know what I'm saying, John?

1225
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,257
Let me do my thing.
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1226
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:37,697
John...

1227
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:40,137
Hey, what's up
with the football block, man?

1228
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:42,417
- Hey, be cool.
- You be cool, okay?

1229
01:06:42,418 --> 01:06:45,616
I am being cool. I just need the goo-gaa!

1230
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:48,337
Okay, when a grown man says
"goo-gaa," it's time to go.

1231
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,058
Okay, all right.

1232
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:54,337
Okay, all right. It's cool. All right.
You made your point.

1233
01:06:54,338 --> 01:06:58,218
You got it. You gotta be cool.

1234
01:06:58,378 --> 01:07:01,698
I'll tell her you said happy birthday.
Yeah.

1235
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:04,498
She'll be touched.

1236
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:13,098
Hey, John. Is everything okay?

1237
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:15,858
- I took care of it. He's gone.
- What did you say?

1238
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:17,938
Don't worry about it.
I put my foot down, okay?

1239
01:07:17,939 --> 01:07:20,579
That's the last we're gonna see
of Evan today.

1240
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,099
You wanna play, boy? Man, stop.
No, you didn't.

1241
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,619
Hey, little brother. Hey, brother.
Hey, my man. Hey, little man.

1242
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,340
Hey, why don't you do me a favor?
I want you to go into the Kidz Only room

1243
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:49,340
and talk to Olivia Danielson and tell her
her dad's out here.

1244
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:51,820
I'm gonna give you $20. Go in there
and tell her that her dad's out here

1245
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:54,061
- and needs the goo-gaa.
- A what?

1246
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:56,340
It's a goo-gaa. It's a pet name for
the blanket. I need the blanket.

1247
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:58,740
Just go in, tell Olivia Danielson
her dad's out here and get the blanket.

1248
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,221
$20, man. Come on, brother.

1249
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:02,620
- I'll take $50, my brother.
-50?

1250
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:06,821
Or you can take your grown self up there
and get the goo-gaa on your own.

1251
01:08:07,862 --> 01:08:10,141
Hey, stop it! I'm not in here
to play with you kids. Stop it!

1252
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:12,941
Look, man, I haven't been to the
cash machine. All I got is $26 in here.

1253
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:15,782
See, that's more than half of $50.

1254
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:19,142
And I got this.

1255
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:21,661
A Peet's Coffee card.
I got $15 worth of credit on it.

1256
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:23,301
You know how much coffee
you can get for $15?

1257
01:08:23,302 --> 01:08:25,702
You drink that coffee, you just keep
playing and playing and playing!

1258
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:27,862
- I'm a kid. I don't drink coffee.
- They got other things.

1259
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,862
They got cookies and cakes and scones.
You like scones?

1260
01:08:30,863 --> 01:08:33,743
Scones? What do I look like,
the Queen of England?

1261
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:36,142
Hey, you stop that right now!
I'm not here to play with you!

1262
01:08:36,143 --> 01:08:38,503
- I'm talking to this child!
- That's a nice Rollie.

1263
01:08:38,504 --> 01:08:40,502
Yes, that is a nice Rollie,
and you just back on up.

1264
01:08:40,503 --> 01:08:42,863
You're not getting my Rollie.
Come on, man. This is $26.

1265
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:46,742
$26, a Peet's Coffee card. That's some
easy money. You want it or not?

1266
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:48,984
Not. Get this fool!

1267
01:08:50,264 --> 01:08:52,144
Hey, stop it right now!

1268
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,223
Grandfather, will you bless the blanket?

1269
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:11,104
Here's the... This guy?

1270
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,505
The blanket works best
through the innocence of a child.

1271
01:09:16,465 --> 01:09:19,225
Okay. Good. Thank you.

1272
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:24,305
- Indigo! Wake up, buddy. Hey! Hey!
- What? What?

1273
01:09:24,306 --> 01:09:25,984
Wake up.
You're going on a vision quest.

1274
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:29,505
- I don't wanna. I'm tired.
- Well, you're gonna.

1275
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:32,545
Your new tribal name, Red Bull.

1276
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:39,345
Okay, I got this. I can do this.

1277
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:40,626
I'm thinking it through,
and I'm letting it flow.

1278
01:09:40,627 --> 01:09:42,866
And I can do this,
and I do not need the goo-gaa.

1279
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,585
Let it flow, Evan. Just let it flow.

1280
01:09:45,586 --> 01:09:49,426
Okay, I know this company. Yes.
I don't know this company. No.

1281
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:52,865
I don't need the goo-gaa,

1282
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:54,746
I don't need the goo-gaa,
'cause this is what I do.

1283
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:59,346
Look at that. All right, how you feel?
How you feel?

1284
01:09:59,347 --> 01:10:01,546
- I'm still tired.
- Yeah, you're still tired? Get up there.

1285
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:02,746
Hey, what is this?

1286
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:07,827
The relationship of this currency
to this company five years out.

1287
01:10:09,227 --> 01:10:12,948
Maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1288
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:17,347
This is a wakalyapi, okay?

1289
01:10:17,348 --> 01:10:20,467
Star blanket.
I need you to feel the magic.

1290
01:10:20,468 --> 01:10:22,267
All right, first up.

1291
01:10:22,268 --> 01:10:23,867
- Oleon.
- Oleon Investments.

1292
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:25,947
- How you feeling about them?
- I want to go to bed.

1293
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:27,707
You want to go to bed? Bull!

1294
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,828
Red Bull. More of it.
And a lot more in the garage.

1295
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:35,107
All right, I got a goo-gaa!
I got a goo-gaa, too! Here's my goo-gaa!

1296
01:10:35,108 --> 01:10:37,508
You think you're the only one with a
goo-gaa. Here's my goo-gaa. Okay?

1297
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:40,108
And I can rub it in little tiny circles,
too, and I can spin in a circle.

1298
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:41,628
And I can say...

1299
01:10:41,629 --> 01:10:44,228
I'm where the princesses are!
I'm where the princesses are!

1300
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:45,428
Sopida's dragon!

1301
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:47,029
Hit me, Daddy!

1302
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,228
- HalliCom Investments.
- HalliCom Investments.

1303
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:51,509
- Sell it!
- Sell?

1304
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,789
- Sell it?
- Sell it!

1305
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,669
- Sell? It's not a...
- Write that down!

1306
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,309
Mopida and Kupida! Mopida and Kupida!
How you doing, Mopida and Kupida?

1307
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,069
Got some questions for you!
One quick question!

1308
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,549
- Pylong.
- Buy it!

1309
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,989
- Diego Industries.
- Sell it!

1310
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,309
Talk to me, ladies.

1311
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,270
It's beautiful!

1312
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:07,470
I can't hear you. Are you whispering?

1313
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,189
One sky!

1314
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,030
If you're whispering, I can't hear.
Talk to me, louder.

1315
01:11:11,031 --> 01:11:13,109
You have approximately 17 hours.

1316
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,750
Sleepover! I don't know
if a sleepover works for me tonight.

1317
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:18,710
The fact of the matter is
I need the goo-gaa.

1318
01:11:18,711 --> 01:11:21,430
I need the goo-gaa. I need the goo-gaa.

1319
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:02,353
Go on, I dare ya! Is that all you've got?

1320
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:07,512
That all you've got?
That's gonna leave a mark.

1321
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,119
Mr. Danielson?

1322
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,119
- Hey, Ella. How are you?
- Why are you stealing our blankets?

1323
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,239
I'm not stealing them.

1324
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,999
I'm taking them to get them cleaned,
because they're dirty.

1325
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,360
You go back to sleep. Night-night.

1326
01:14:43,161 --> 01:14:45,600
- Mr. Danielson?
- Hey, hey, what's going on, Will?

1327
01:14:45,601 --> 01:14:47,000
- How you doing?
- Why are you in our house?

1328
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:48,120
Hey, man, it's all good.
Go on back to bed

1329
01:14:48,121 --> 01:14:50,400
- I'm on my way out. Go back to bed.
- Why do you have those blankets?

1330
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:51,520
I'm taking the blankets
to get them cleaned.

1331
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:52,800
You go back to bed.
You're having a bad dream.

1332
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:54,280
- This is my sister's blanket.
- Go back to bed.

1333
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,360
Be a good little boy,
and go back to bed now.

1334
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,641
- No, give it.
- You let go right now.

1335
01:14:56,642 --> 01:14:58,080
- You're being very disrespectful.
- Give it!

1336
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:01,360
- Give me the blanket.
- You're a horrible little boy!

1337
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:04,401
- A horrible child!
- Give me the blanket!

1338
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:07,681
- Evan, what the hell are you doing?
- He's trying to steal their blankets.

1339
01:15:07,682 --> 01:15:11,201
For God's sake, Evan!
Have you any dignity at all?

1340
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:13,601
- Yes, I do!
- No, you don't. Look at you.

1341
01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:17,121
- And now they're up.
- Hey, you are stealing our blankets.

1342
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:19,201
See? Now you messed
with my little girl. Give me them!

1343
01:15:19,202 --> 01:15:20,321
Everybody calm down! Calm down!

1344
01:15:20,322 --> 01:15:23,842
Everybody's gonna get their blanket.
I just want this one here.

1345
01:15:23,882 --> 01:15:25,602
Okay, all right. Here you go.

1346
01:15:25,603 --> 01:15:28,162
Here's your blanket! I just want this one!
Okay, it's all good now.

1347
01:15:28,163 --> 01:15:30,082
- You're not taking no blanket!
- I paid for this blanket!

1348
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,322
- I don't care what you paid for!
- Wait, wait. It's little Evan.

1349
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:34,082
Now you want to whisper? No, no.

1350
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,242
- Come on, man!
- No.

1351
01:15:36,243 --> 01:15:38,643
- Come on, man.
- Get out.

1352
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:41,403
It's okay, baby. Will!

1353
01:15:46,324 --> 01:15:48,283
This blanket is mine! It's mine!

1354
01:15:48,284 --> 01:15:52,844
I'm calling Trish.
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

1355
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:54,803
Evan, get help. Get help!

1356
01:15:54,804 --> 01:15:56,484
I don't need help.
What I need is my blanket!

1357
01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:00,364
- Man, you're crazy!
- I am not crazy! I want my goo-gaa!

1358
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:02,963
I want my goo-gaa!

1359
01:16:02,964 --> 01:16:06,243
- John! John! This is important!
- I'm calling the police!

1360
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:08,284
I want my goo-gaa! I want my goo-gaa!

1361
01:16:08,285 --> 01:16:09,764
John, come on, man,
this is life and death!

1362
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:13,044
We're gonna go back to bed.
Everybody, back to bed.

1363
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:27,045
Yeah, man!

1364
01:16:27,846 --> 01:16:29,325
Johnny!

1365
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:32,485
Come inside before the neighbors
call the fire department again!

1366
01:16:32,486 --> 01:16:34,925
Hey, Cheryl! We're down here working!

1367
01:16:34,926 --> 01:16:37,966
You think your new nose
just crawled on your face?

1368
01:16:40,406 --> 01:16:41,886
- What's the next one?
- John!

1369
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:43,246
Yeah.

1370
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:46,326
- I'm sorry. Look...
- What's up, bro?

1371
01:16:46,566 --> 01:16:48,646
Listen, it's getting late.

1372
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:52,326
I think we need
to rethink this blanket strategy.

1373
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:54,606
- You doubting the wakalyapi?
- No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1374
01:16:54,607 --> 01:16:57,886
So, you are saying that
my son's not a seer?

1375
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:02,246
- Is that what you are saying?
- I see beyond, like the great salmon!

1376
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,367
With wings! That flies!

1377
01:17:04,368 --> 01:17:06,007
You got tiny eyes, man.

1378
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:08,887
- You got the eyes of a salamander.
- What?

1379
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:11,287
You say my kid's not a seer?
He's a Whitefeather!

1380
01:17:11,288 --> 01:17:13,647
Come here, boy! Get over here!

1381
01:17:13,648 --> 01:17:15,967
AampCo! What you feeling
about AampCo?

1382
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:17,567
AampCo is tight!

1383
01:17:17,568 --> 01:17:20,647
- AampCo is tight! Write that down!
- Write that down!

1384
01:17:20,648 --> 01:17:22,767
No, Johnny,
I'm not gonna write it down, okay?

1385
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,448
I can't go to Dante D'Enzo and say,
"AampCo is tight

1386
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:27,288
"because we're listening
to the Great Winged Salmon,

1387
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:30,568
"who's actually a 10-year-old boy
with a $6,000 blanket,

1388
01:17:30,569 --> 01:17:33,208
"who's hopped up on Red Bull!"

1389
01:17:35,369 --> 01:17:38,488
Listen to me, Johnny.
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

1390
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:41,849
We can't blow this thing.
You are better than this.

1391
01:17:42,009 --> 01:17:44,689
- Tell him he's out.
- You're out!

1392
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,889
- What?
- Tell him he's out of the tribe.

1393
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:49,209
- You're out of the tribe!
- I'm out of the tribe?

1394
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:53,289
You're out of the tribe, because
you're blind to the poetry of smoke!

1395
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,409
Blind to the poetry of...

1396
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,449
Stop it! Just zip it! Zip it!
You are a crazy little kid!

1397
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:00,449
And you, you're a liar! I'm out?

1398
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:05,089
Good. Wrap it up! I have never been
so happy to be out, okay?

1399
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:09,050
I didn't go to business school for this!
I graduated from Stanford with an MBA!

1400
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,491
And they don't just give
those things away, Whitefeather!

1401
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,370
- Get him.
- Back off, you little freak!

1402
01:18:17,131 --> 01:18:19,051
Get some sleep!

1403
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:22,771
Hey, Trish, it's me!

1404
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:30,051
- Trish, I really need to see her.
- No, no. I just now got her to sleep.

1405
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:32,210
And with tonight,
and singing tomorrow...

1406
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:35,211
- Please. Please, Trish.
- She just...

1407
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,131
Okay.

1408
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:40,891
Thank you.

1409
01:18:46,573 --> 01:18:48,772
Can you please leave?

1410
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:53,892
Hey, Liv, I'm sorry about
what happened at the sleepover.

1411
01:18:53,893 --> 01:18:56,012
I want you to go.

1412
01:18:57,293 --> 01:18:59,212
About the concert...

1413
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:01,452
I'm not gonna be able
to come to the concert,

1414
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,492
because it's at the same time
as a meeting I have to...

1415
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:05,452
I don't want you there.

1416
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:11,013
Okay. I understand.

1417
01:19:11,053 --> 01:19:14,413
I just want you to know that
I really did want to go.

1418
01:19:14,414 --> 01:19:17,853
I don't care. Don't come.

1419
01:19:18,813 --> 01:19:20,494
I won't.

1420
01:19:20,654 --> 01:19:23,094
I won't because you don't want me to.

1421
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:26,054
But...

1422
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:28,254
Liv, I really have to go to this meeting.

1423
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,014
It's really important. It's a really
important meeting, and I really need...

1424
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:54,536
Promise I'll get it right back to you.
Night-night.

1425
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:10,856
It's okay. She's fine. She gave it to me.

1426
01:20:11,857 --> 01:20:14,095
- What?
- She told me, Evan.

1427
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:16,136
- Everything.
- Okay, well, then you understand.

1428
01:20:16,137 --> 01:20:18,495
No, I don't understand.

1429
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:20,815
I mean, do you honestly believe that
that blanket

1430
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,376
has something to do
with everything that's been going on?

1431
01:20:23,377 --> 01:20:26,216
Look, I don't know what's happening.
I know something's happening.

1432
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:28,937
I need for it to happen
one more time tonight.

1433
01:20:29,137 --> 01:20:31,856
So, now we're back to what you need.

1434
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:33,056
Hey, Trish, what do you want me to do?

1435
01:20:33,057 --> 01:20:35,337
Blow off an opportunity
I've been waiting for since grad school

1436
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:36,657
and lose my job?

1437
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:42,497
Evan, you have two jobs, and
one of those jobs is being a father.

1438
01:20:42,498 --> 01:20:43,737
And she needs to know

1439
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:46,897
that you care as much about that job
as you do the other.

1440
01:20:46,898 --> 01:20:50,538
- I do. Of course I do.
- Then leave the blanket.

1441
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:56,498
I can't. Not tonight, I can't.

1442
01:20:56,979 --> 01:20:59,218
I don't expect you to understand.

1443
01:22:59,465 --> 01:23:02,263
How you doing, Feather Man?
Pretty good, brother. How you doing?

1444
01:23:02,264 --> 01:23:04,531
Not so bad. A little amped,
a little tired.

1445
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:06,144
Ain't nothing but a thing.

1446
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:08,504
How about another Red Bull?
Wouldn't say no to that.

1447
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:58,507
- Good luck, Johnny.
- Luck is for losers.

1448
01:24:02,028 --> 01:24:05,907
Good. Here we are.
Gentlemen, this is Mr. D'Enzo.

1449
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,867
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1450
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:10,507
Mr. D'Enzo. John Whitefeather.

1451
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:12,427
Have a seat, guys.

1452
01:24:18,468 --> 01:24:22,908
D- Papa-D to the Feather Man.
I think you're reading my signals.

1453
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:24,508
And I think you're reading them
loud and clear.

1454
01:24:24,509 --> 01:24:27,788
You're getting the wisdom.
Diversification.

1455
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,108
Buy long, sell short.

1456
01:24:29,108 --> 01:24:31,108
- Sell short, buy long.
- Hi.

1457
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:33,828
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the Fall Sing.

1458
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:36,508
It's so good to see
so many of you here today.

1459
01:24:36,509 --> 01:24:39,588
Well, I can hear a lot of
very excited children back there,

1460
01:24:39,589 --> 01:24:42,909
who, like their parents, are not here
to listen to me continue talking.

1461
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:48,789
So without further ado,
the wonderful Chilton School choir.

1462
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:07,590
Summer fades into the blue

1463
01:25:07,591 --> 01:25:11,391
Brand new colors come into view

1464
01:25:11,591 --> 01:25:15,390
Seasons change
I have, too

1465
01:25:15,391 --> 01:25:19,551
Just like the leaves of autumn

1466
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:23,150
You know what I see in this room
that nobody else sees?

1467
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:24,430
Hidden feathers.

1468
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:28,351
That's what we share, hidden feathers!
Crow feathers.

1469
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:31,031
Right now,

1470
01:25:32,112 --> 01:25:34,071
I need you to caw with me.

1471
01:25:35,312 --> 01:25:37,712
One crow to another crow.

1472
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:46,992
Bring it. Come on. Bring it in.

1473
01:25:56,633 --> 01:26:00,272
I know you want to let it out,
but I appreciate you keeping it in.

1474
01:26:01,794 --> 01:26:04,233
There it be, brother crow.

1475
01:26:05,313 --> 01:26:07,753
Look forward to working with you, man.

1476
01:26:12,154 --> 01:26:13,753
Wow.

1477
01:26:14,914 --> 01:26:17,314
I've never seen anything like that before.

1478
01:26:17,314 --> 01:26:18,753
I know.

1479
01:26:18,754 --> 01:26:21,154
No, you don't know.

1480
01:26:21,155 --> 01:26:25,834
Quite frankly, that's one of the
biggest loads of crap I've ever heard.

1481
01:26:26,195 --> 01:26:28,354
What possible excuse can you give us

1482
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:32,953
for wasting our time
with that unctuous stream of drivel

1483
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,274
that you call a presentation?

1484
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:39,554
- My kid.
- What?

1485
01:26:39,555 --> 01:26:41,195
My kid.

1486
01:26:41,316 --> 01:26:44,476
He's been wanting to get more
involved in my workplace life.

1487
01:26:44,477 --> 01:26:46,995
He's like, "Dad, I'm on a vision quest.
I got some investment ideas. "

1488
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:50,275
I'm like, "You're nine.
How many good ideas could you have?"

1489
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:52,714
He's on a vision quest. I'm like,
"Vision quest, my red butt! But"...

1490
01:26:52,715 --> 01:26:54,275
You're blaming your child?

1491
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,789
Look, don't let it rattle
your corn stalk...

1492
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,516
All right, enough!

1493
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:01,476
I don't mind this Indian business
when it's working.

1494
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:05,395
- When it's not, it's just annoying.
- Whoa!

1495
01:27:05,396 --> 01:27:09,796
- That's deep shadow time.
- Seriously, cut the crap.

1496
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:13,155
You're not even a real
Native American.

1497
01:27:13,156 --> 01:27:15,876
The fact is
you're mostly Finnish-Armenian.

1498
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:18,756
Your baptismal name
is Johann Hasuvian.

1499
01:27:18,757 --> 01:27:22,116
And your great-grandfather
was one half Navajo.

1500
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:25,957
So, what would that make you?
1/32?

1501
01:27:26,718 --> 01:27:29,677
Frankly, you are an offense
to true Native Americans,

1502
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,344
and if you have nothing better
to offer...

1503
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,437
All right, all right.

1504
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:36,837
Johnny Whitefeather can see
which way this wind's blowing.

1505
01:27:38,678 --> 01:27:42,398
It's your loss! Old croaking toad.

1506
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:50,638
I'm going this way!

1507
01:27:54,919 --> 01:27:57,278
Well, Mr. Danielson?

1508
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:01,079
Looks like this job is yours to lose.

1509
01:28:02,599 --> 01:28:04,798
I'll get right to it.

1510
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,159
Mr. Danielson?

1511
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:21,880
Evan?

1512
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,880
I can't do this.

1513
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,880
I'm sorry?

1514
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,279
I messed up. I really have.

1515
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,880
Sorry, what?

1516
01:28:34,721 --> 01:28:38,680
- Are you walking out?
- I'm really sorry, sir. I just can't.

1517
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:40,920
You realize what you're giving up?

1518
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,761
Yes, sir, I do.

1519
01:28:49,002 --> 01:28:51,041
Sorry, Tom.

1520
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:59,161
Could I see that brochure, please?

1521
01:29:03,722 --> 01:29:06,722
Ain't nothing but a thing, man.

1522
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:42,043
Next, we will sing
a traditionaI Japanese folk song

1523
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:45,803
about the blooming
of the cherry blossom, the Sakura.

1524
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,766
Sorry! Sorry about that!

1525
01:30:39,687 --> 01:30:43,246
The next song is one you all know,
so feeI free to sing along.

1526
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:46,767
Just don't sing louder than us.
It's our concert.

1527
01:30:54,567 --> 01:31:02,720
¶¶ Love, love, love ¶¶

01:31:02,721 --> 01:31:10,938

Music sounds only

1533
01:31:56,091 --> 01:32:00,130
[door opening]

1534
01:32:31,651 --> 01:32:35,251

¶¶ Love is all you need ¶¶

1552
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,655
Nice king hat.

1553
01:33:48,536 --> 01:33:50,696
It's called a crown.

1554
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:56,855
You know,
you were really great in there.

1555
01:33:56,856 --> 01:33:59,935
- Thanks.
- Hey, listen, I got something for you.

1556
01:34:02,297 --> 01:34:05,336
- I don't need it anymore.
- Really?

1557
01:34:05,616 --> 01:34:07,096
I was hoping you would take it,
and, you know,

1558
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:09,335
you'd help me apologize
to the princesses.

1559
01:34:09,336 --> 01:34:12,016
- You can do it yourself.
- I can?

1560
01:34:12,017 --> 01:34:14,017
Yeah, they're right there.

1561
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:18,257
Okay. Well...

1562
01:34:19,137 --> 01:34:22,617
Sopida, I wish that I could say
you were wrong about me,

1563
01:34:22,618 --> 01:34:25,696
but, obviously,
you and your dragon knew better.

1564
01:34:25,697 --> 01:34:27,457
I'm sorry.

1565
01:34:28,058 --> 01:34:31,257
Thank you for protecting Olivia
while I was away.

1566
01:34:31,258 --> 01:34:33,817
And Kupida and Mopida,

1567
01:34:34,178 --> 01:34:38,017
I'm sorry for taking you for granted
and just expecting things from you

1568
01:34:38,018 --> 01:34:41,738
and not realizing how smart and kind

1569
01:34:42,538 --> 01:34:45,138
and truly amazing you really are.

1570
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:46,978
Qwali, thank you so much

1571
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:50,617
for letting me come into your mystical,
magical world,

1572
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:56,058
- 'cause it's a truly magical...
- Daddy, they're leaving. They got bored.

1573
01:34:56,098 --> 01:34:58,258
They were bored.

1574
01:34:59,419 --> 01:35:01,938
Do you want me to ask them to stay?

1575
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:04,059
Well, what do they want to do?

1576
01:35:06,939 --> 01:35:09,499
They said it's time for them to go.

1577
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:14,419
Well, then I think they should go then.

1578
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:16,539
Wave goodbye.

1579
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,340
There they go.

1580
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:37,821
Hey, guys. What you doing?

1581
01:35:38,021 --> 01:35:41,340
Just waving goodbye to Qwali
and the princesses.

1582
01:35:41,341 --> 01:35:44,821
Really? They're going away?

1583
01:35:45,661 --> 01:35:47,581
How about that?

1584
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:52,621
You know, I think
there's somebody here to see you.

1585
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:00,541
Wow, so, they're really gone?

1586
01:36:06,462 --> 01:36:08,302
Nice outfit.

1587
01:36:09,423 --> 01:36:13,103
I take it this is why
you walked out of our meeting.

1588
01:36:15,343 --> 01:36:19,383
Do you know how many people
have ever done anything like that to me?

1589
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:23,902
- Two.
- Two.

1590
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:27,703
You want to know where they are
in their careers right now?

1591
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:31,223
Each one is running
a key division of my company.

1592
01:36:31,824 --> 01:36:35,223
I don't want any sycophants around me.
I want people with confidence

1593
01:36:35,224 --> 01:36:38,783
who are not afraid to make decisions,
even under pressure.

1594
01:36:39,064 --> 01:36:41,504
Incidentally, this is very good.

1595
01:36:42,784 --> 01:36:45,344
You are very good indeed,

1596
01:36:45,704 --> 01:36:48,824
and I want you
to head our western division.

1597
01:36:48,984 --> 01:36:52,344
I'd like to discuss that with you,
so, please...

1598
01:36:57,665 --> 01:37:02,625
Sir, I would love to discuss it now,
but it's Saturday.

1599
01:37:05,185 --> 01:37:06,904
Sure.

1600
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:10,584
- Well, Monday, then.
- Monday.

1601
01:37:11,466 --> 01:37:15,385
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1602
01:37:16,145 --> 01:37:18,065
I have a daughter, too.

1603
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,106
I haven't seen her for years.

1604
01:37:23,746 --> 01:37:28,866
- So, have a pleasant Saturday.
- You, too, sir.

1605
01:37:36,227 --> 01:37:38,146
So, what are you guys doing
with the rest of the day?

1606
01:37:38,147 --> 01:37:39,426
I don't know. What do you want to do?

1607
01:37:39,427 --> 01:37:44,187
I think Mommy should get a chance
to try some of your special pancakes.
