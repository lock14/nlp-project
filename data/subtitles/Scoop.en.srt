Don't mourn

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,796
Joe Strombel led a full life.

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,164
A newspaperman
in the best tradition.

4
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:53,944
A great credit
to the fourth estate.

5
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:58,081
It didn't matter
if the bombs in the
war zone were falling.

6
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,647
It didn't matter
how high up
the political scandal went,

7
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,617
or how many
big corporations

8
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:07,213
or small-time racketeers
leaned on him.

9
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:11,384
Whatever the risk,
if there was a story there,

10
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:15,128
Joe went after it.
And he usually got it.

11
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,427
Well, I was with him
when the story broke
about Prince Charles,

12
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:21,301
and that made him
persona non grata
with the Royal Family.

13
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:24,240
Except with Diana.
They always remained
good friends.

14
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:25,936
(ALL AGREEING)
He did love a woman.

15
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,509
Hey, did you know he started
as a police reporter?

16
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,342
Did he?
Yeah, he was
a bloody good one.

17
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:32,348
One of the best.
Maybe the best.

18
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,850
I got trapped with Joe once
in Afghanistan.

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,908
Yeah?

20
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,180
And we were going
to be shot any moment
by the Taliban, until,

21
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:40,685
typically, Joe found
someone to bribe

22
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,453
(ALL LAUGHING)
So we could escape.

23
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:45,587

though.
No, no, he got it on expenses.

24

MAN 1: Not always at
British intelligence.

29
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,037
No, but he got
the information
before anyone else.

30
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,169
Yeah, he did. That's right.
Not Richard Nixon, though.

Joe, it won't be the same
without you, mate.

You?

I'm... Well, I was
personal secretary
to Peter Lyman.

44
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:10,509
Lord Lyman's son.
Yes, impressive young man.

45
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,781
You knew him?
No, only by reputation.

46
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,550
But I like what I know.

a real future in politics.

I think I was poisoned.

You think?

51
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,988
Why?

52
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:28,930
I believe I was poisoned

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,834
because I was
on the verge of confirming
a terrible suspicion.

54
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,867
Yes?
What suspicion is that?

55
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,771
That Peter Lyman
is the serial killer

56
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:41,672
known to the police
as the Tarot Card Killer.

57
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,906
(CHUCKLES) What?

58
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,177
I assume
you're aware of that case?

59
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,718
Yeah, I wrote an article
two years ago, when the
Tarot killings first started.

60
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,255
But Peter Lyman? My God.

61
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,218
What on earth
made you suspect

62
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,783
this rich, young handsome,
above-reproach citizen?

63
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,091
You remember the last murder?
The police found a clue.

64
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,492
Yes, a cufflink.
I read about it in the paper.

Yep.

Peter had the exact pair.

67
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,903
So could have
the Tarot Killer.

68
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,569
The world is full
of coincidences.

69
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,910
Yeah, except I noticed
that Peter only had one left.

70
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:18,882
He'd lost the other.

71
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:21,512
Still,

72
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,615
although
it's a tantalizing thought.

73
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,122
Did you inform the police,
or was that too sticky?

74
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,418
I didn't know what to do,
so I phoned my lawyer

75
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,723
and I asked his advice
on whether to
report it or not.

76
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,394
And I thought
I heard this click
on the phone,

77
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,598

had been listening.

78
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,798
Later that day, after tea,

79
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,771
I died suddenly.

80
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,207
That is suspicious.

81
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,911
My God, Peter Lyman.

82
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,451
Hard to believe,
but if he did turn out
to be the Tarot Killer,

83
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:58,415
what a story.

84
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,117

when you said
you were a reporter.

85
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:04,093
This would be
a dynamite scoop.
And I got it first.

86

Yeah. Unfortunately,
where you're headed

about getting an interview
for the school newspaper.

because... Not you.

Actually,

107
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,255
I was wondering
if we could just ask you
a couple of questions.

00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:40,014
And when you say something
more serious, that's...

112
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,360
You really want to know?

113
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,630
Well, originally, I wasn't
going to go to college.

114
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,725
I was going to become
a dental hygienist
like my sister, Beverly.

115
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,894
And, don't get me wrong,
it's a great profession.

won a visit to Palm Beach

122

with their granddaughter,

Oh, thanks.

and I didn't even
get the interview.

126
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,757

got fired from some project

330
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,221
but more women
will be murdered
until he is stopped.

331
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,856
That's horrible!
We have to notify the police.

332
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,397
No, no.
What kind of reporter are you?

333
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,435
That would be a disaster!
God, no!

334
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,471
He's a respected millionaire.
You can't accuse anyone,

335
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:30,939
let alone someone like that
without substantial proof.

336
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:35,240
And once you've alerted him
to the suspicion...
That he is under suspicion,

337
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,871
then he'll be
impossible to trap.

338
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,744
(CHUCKLES) Not to mention
doubly dangerous.

339
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:41,717
There's also a possibility
that he poisoned his secretary

340
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,721
because he suspected that
she was learning the truth.

341
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,189
No, you have to
get the story first,

342
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,692
but first you have to
get the story right!

343
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,656
There's no certainty
in this, or...

344
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,661
I got a feeling
in my gut about this.

345
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,757
The kind
that journalists dream about.

346
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,664
And so far, no one else
has the information.

347
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,703
(CHUCKLES) Oh,
if I was around today,

348
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,865
I'd find a way
to get the facts

349
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,239
and break this case
wide open!

350
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,742
Now, believe me, Sondra.

351
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,377
You can wait your whole life
for a story like this.

352
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,916
Don't blow it.

353
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:17,080
And be careful.
Lives are in the balance.

354
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,051
Possibly, maybe yours.

355
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:22,720
Got to go. Got to go.

356
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,172
That's it for me.
You got to help me with this.

357
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,140
Not me, honey.
I'm a prestidigitator.

358
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,800
I do coin tricks
and card tricks.

359
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,469
And I'm a journalist
sitting on top of

360
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,137
one of the biggest
stories of all time!

361
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,875
Yeah. For a college paper!

362
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,176
Kid, you're in
over your head.

363
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,151
You know what you should do?
You should share this story.
Share it?

364
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,050
No!
I gotta dig up the facts

365
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,788
and then
I gotta shop it around
to every paper in town.

366
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:55,484
(MUTTERING)
Look at her.

367
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,084
Soon you'll be drinking
the black coffee

368
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,026
and smoking cigarettes
with the hat back.
Now, what kind of...

369
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,563
We don't have much time here.

370
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,361
I mean, we got to strike!
You know this guy's
a serial killer.

371
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,799
He could just kill
at any moment!

372
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,770
I heard that part.
That's when I knew
I was gonna make other plans.

373
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,897
You should go call the police.
That's what I'd do.

374
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,374
Yeah, and
what am I gonna tell them?

375
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,343
Tell them that...
Exactly what he told you.

376
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,711
That Lord Lyman's son,
Peter, is... He suspects
he's a serial killer.

377
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:21,784
Uh-huh, and when they ask me
where I got this
information from?

378
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:24,719
(STUTTERING) Well, tell them!
You know, just say,
you know tell them...

379
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:26,753
Just explain to them that...

380
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,820
You know, say that...
Tell them...

381
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,349
Where did you get
the information?

382
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,328
Was that the question
that you just asked?

383
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,393
I would not say anything
if I were you 'cause
they'll put you away.

384
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:39,435
(STUTTERING) That's exactly
what I'm saying.

385
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:42,199
I'm gonna say,
"I got this information
from a dead guy"?

386
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:45,503
Listen, this is not for me,
Sondra. I don't do this.

387
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,567
I do occasional bar mitzvahs
and kids' parties.

388
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,403
You know, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

389
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,814
Peter Lyman.
Who is Peter Lyman, you know?

390
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,045
How can we meet him?

391
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,384
How can we see
what we're dealing with here?

392
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,018
(SCOFFING)

393
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,790
What the hell are we doing
here? You don't even know
what the guy looks like.

394
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:10,855
That's why we're here.

395
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,232
I just couldn't get
a clear picture of him
on the Internet, so...

396
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:17,205
(STUTTERING) Jesus.
And what are we going to do
if we see him?

397
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,333
I mean, what
are you gonna learn
by looking at him?

398
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,742
Unless he
strangles a passerby.

399
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,041
I don't know, Sidney.
I'm improvising.

400
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:27,776
I should be home,
working on my magic.

401
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,451
Hey, why don't you
think about this

402
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,182
as adding
some excitement to your life?

403
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,981
Hey, sweetheart,
excitement in my life

404
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,584
is dinner
without heartburn after it.

405
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,892
Do you have a family?

406
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:48,463
I had a wife,
but she dumped me,
if you can believe that.

407
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:51,141
Somehow...

408
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,537
She thought I was immature
and that I never grew up.

409
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:57,277
Now, I had
a great rebuttal for her.

410
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:58,508
I could have nailed her,
you know,

411
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:02,746
but I raised my hand
and she would not call on me.

412
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,213
Sidney...
What?

413
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,380
That's him.

414
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,887
Let's follow him.

415
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,686
Follow? What do you
want to follow him for?

416
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:17,096
I'm telling you.
We need clues, we need a lead.
We gotta start someplace.

417
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,567
No, darling, I do not think
this is a good idea.

418
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:20,898
It's a very good idea.

419
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:24,762
Come on!

420
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:32,971
Be careful.

421
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,653
Hey, don't touch anything.

422
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,211
You know,
if you break something here,

423
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:40,814
you're gonna be washing dishes
the rest of your life.

424
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:42,080
(EXCLAIMS)

425
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,654
SID: Okay,
now you've seen him. Let's go.

426
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:52,223
Jerry! It's Jerry Burke,
Louis' chiropractor.

427
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:53,667
Hi.
Nice to see you.

428
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:56,738
That's how you follow a guy?
It's not even Peter Lyman!

429
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,933
I told you
the photos weren't clear.

430
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,875
Sweetheart,
you should live
and be well, prosper.

431
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,607
I hope... I say this
with all due respect.

432
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,979
But without me.

433
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,816
I'm tired, I'm bored,
I'm hungry, I'm going home.
God love you.

434
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:12,013
I'll look for your byline.
Sidney!

435
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:16,788
I'm about to become
your favorite person.
Why?

436
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,852
I ran into someone today
who said that Peter Lyman

437
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,896
swims at the Governor's Club
every day.

438
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,794
Really?
What's the Governor's Club?

439
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:24,128
It's this posh, private club,

440
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,567
but Daddy's partner's a member
and members are allowed
to bring guests.

441
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,730
Wow, do you think
I could bring someone?

442
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:31,240
I'm sure
Daddy can arrange it.
When do you want to go?

443
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,383
How can I help you?

444
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,715
Hi.
We're guests of the Fultons.

445
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,016
We're here to take a dip.

446
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:47,386
Oh, yes, yes. The lockers
are on the first floor.

447
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,891
The pool's downstairs.
Great.

448
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:52,162
By the way,
is Peter Lyman here,
by any chance?

449
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:53,355
Mr. Lyman.

450
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,864
Yes, came in
a few minutes ago.

451
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,729
What color bathing suit
does he have on?

452
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,789
Hey.

453
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,358
I... Do you want me
to clash with him?

454
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:03,362
So silly.

455
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:07,441
So do you swim?
Of course I don't swim.
You have to ask?

456
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,637
What? They say
it's the best form
of exercise.

457
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,506
Yes, but when
I go into the water,

458
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:15,278
my glasses, you know,
float off my head
into the pool.

459
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:18,243
Hey, Sidney,
that's got to be him.

460
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:19,721
Yeah, well,
make sure this time.

461
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:22,554
'Cause I don't want
to swim around after
another chiropractor.

462
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,183
Hmm, he's very handsome.

463
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,765
This guy is a serial killer
like I play for
the New York Jets.

464
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,832
How can we meet him?

465
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,197
(STUTTERING) I don't know.
They have a class system.

466
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,898
He's an aristocrat,
and, you know,
we're commoners.

467
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:40,907
In fact, according to his
system, I think we're probably
classified as scum.

468
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,845
This is our only chance.
He's all alone.

469
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,847
Well, you're
a pretty girl.

470
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:49,407
You know, I think you could
probably get this guy
to get interested in you.

471
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,182
Don't be silly.
Particularly if he's got
a twisted mind.

472
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,886
Look, I can't
just go up to him and say,
"Hi, how are you?"

473
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,987
I mean,
what if he gets suspicious,
or, you know,

474
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:02,463
if he gets put off, or...

475
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:03,555
Drown.

476
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,894
What?
Drown! Drown!
I'll go get... I'll go get...

477
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,268
(SCOFFS)
Listen to me!

478
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:09,532
I'll go get coffee.

479
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,541
Get a cramp,
go in the water,
flounder around,

480
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,804
you know. Yes!

481
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:17,007
Go ahead, sweetheart.
That's a great idea.

482
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,777
He'll be obliged
to save you that way.

483
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:22,875
And if he doesn't...
lf, you know...
Then I'll notify your parents.

00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:24,579
Here we are. You all right?
Thank you.

494
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:27,112
You okay?
Yes, thank you very much.

495
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:28,946
Sorry.
It's my pleasure.
Here, let me help you out.

496
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,208
(GRUNTS)

497
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,847
I'm not a very good swimmer.

498
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,587
(COUGHING)
It's all right.

499
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:35,953
My leg cramped.

500
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,084
Your leg?
Here, stretch it out.

501
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,219
Oh.
That's it.

502
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,557
Thank you.
No problem.

503
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:42,230
Listen, you should always
do a little stretching
before you go in.

504
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,857
You know,
that way you won't cramp.
Oh, thank you very much.

505
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,470
I haven't been swimming
in so long.

506
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,502
You're a new face.

507
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,397
Have you
just become a member?

508
00:26:51,474 --> 00:26:53,875
Oh, no,
I'm a guest of the Fultons.

509
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,205
Oh, right, Jack Fulton.
Yes, lovely chap.

510
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,447
I'm Peter Lyman, by the way.
Hi, Son...

511
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,939
Sond...

512
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,644
Jade.

513
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,115
Jade Spence.

514
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:07,253
Jade Julliard Spence.

515
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:10,222
That's a very pretty name.
Thank you.

516
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:13,818
Yes, we're the Spences of...
Of Palm Beach.

517
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:17,028
Oh, not the same Spences
who own the shipping line?

518
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,632
No, no, no.

519
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,671
My father's into
silver and gold

520
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,673
and drilling.
Ah.

521
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,032
For wells.

522
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,402
What are you doing
in London?

523
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:31,346
I'm here visiting friends
in Holland Park.

524
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:33,645
Oh, good.
What do you do, Jade?

525
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,515
Well, I am an actress.

526
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:37,848
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:40,317
Yes, actually
I'm up for the part of Desiree

528
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,415
in the new Mike Tinsley film.

529
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,324
Oh, well, you're certainly
beautiful enough.

530
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,052
(GIGGLING) Thank you.

531
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,959
Look, Jade,

532
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:49,423
if you're not busy,

533
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,263
my father's giving
a garden party
at the estate on Sunday

534
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,597
and I'd love you to come.

535
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,798
I'd be very happy
to be your date
and show you around.

536
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:59,740
The English countryside
is very lovely
this time of the year.

537
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,971
Sounds fantastic.
Good.

538
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,512
Do you mind
if I bring my father?

539
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,078
Your father?

540
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,276
Oh, look!
There he is right now.

541
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:09,740
Ah.

542
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,785
I was in the lounge.
I heard you drowning.

543
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:15,051
I finished my tea and scones
and came immediately.

544
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:16,853
SONDRA: Dad,
this is Peter Lyman,

545
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,622
who was nice enough
to rescue me.

546
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:19,684
Dad?

547
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,563
Yes, of course, child!

548
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,730
She cannot swim.
The girl cannot swim.

549
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:32,001
Like a lead weight,
she sinks to the bottom
all the time.

550
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:36,044
It's a family trait.
Lack of buoyancy, or...
Her siblings have it as well.

551
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,980
Yes, well, listen,
pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Spence, right?

552
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,073
Yes.

553
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,549
Yes, and I'll see you
on Sunday at the estate.

554
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,814
Oh, great.
Sunday? What's Sunday?
Not a fox hunt?

555
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:47,947
(CHUCKLING)
No. No, Dad.
I'll explain it to you later.

556
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,083
Listen, I'll leave
all the information
at the desk, all right?

557
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,558
Hey, come, child.

558
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,731
What kind of idiot are you?
Not a fox hunt?

559
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,597
I'd like
to talk to these people
in their own terms.

560
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:02,294
And, oh,
thanks for telling him
I'm your father.

561
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,202
Oh, incidentally, he thinks
my name is Jade Spence,

562
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:06,798
so that makes you
Mr. Spence.

563
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:10,039
Wait a minute, I... This is
too tricky. I don't want to
go ahead with this.

564
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:13,273
Why? What's wrong with you?
Your whole life is deception.
You're a magician.

565
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:16,375
Yes, I'm a magician
and I want to stay a magician.
Can I have a Coke please?

566
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,853
I don't want to get sued
or deported

567
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,253
or arrested
for stalking somebody.

568
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,451
This is a big guy
you're dealing with.

569
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:26,325
This is a big story,
no kidding.
That's what Joe Strombel said.

570
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:29,160
That's why he returned,
you know. This is
his last big scoop.

571
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,461
Hey. What do I care
about Joe Strombel?

572
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:34,230
Suddenly I'm taking direction
from a hunk of ectoplasm?

573
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,271
This could be
very big for my career.

574
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:40,337
Your career's fine.
You're on the college Bugle,
or whatever it is.

575
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,001
You got years for scoops.

576
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,703
You know what?
Forget you, all right.

577
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,772
I'll do this on my own.
I don't need you.
Go back to your card tricks.

578
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,613
I didn't say
I wouldn't help you.

579
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:51,244
You know, I just...
It has to be done properly.

580
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,646
You know, we gotta
put our heads together.

581
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:56,723
If we put
our heads together,
you'll hear a hollow noise.

582
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,676
Look at this place.
All it's missing is a moat.

583
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:25,347
Ooh! Hey,
I could get used to this.

584
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:27,250
Look at this.

585
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:32,161
SONDRA: Oh, there he is.
Remember, Jade Spence.

586
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:33,692
Jade...
Jade, who?

587
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,295
(MUMBLING)

588
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,066
Ah.
PETER: There you are.

589
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:40,932
Hello.
How are you? Welcome,
Mr. Spence and Jade.

590
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:42,163
Mr. Spence.

591
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:45,674
You look stunning. Stunning.
Oh, thank you.
It's beautiful here.

592
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:46,834
Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

593
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,401
It's been in the family
for years. About 400 years.

594
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,413
It's a little stuffy
for my taste, but...
Oh.

595
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,778
She said,
"All that's missing
is a moat."

596
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,885
Right.
(CHUCKLES) I love that.
I love the moat line.

597
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:59,980
"All that's missing
is a moat." Beautiful.
Ah, this is my father.

598
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,520
Father, Stephen Lyman,
this is... These are
my friends from America

599
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:03,923
I was telling you about.
Oh, Lord Lyman.

600
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:05,016
Jade Spence, Mr. Spence.

601
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:06,627
How are you?
Hello.

602
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,996
Curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
I've never met a Lord before.

603
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,159
How exciting!

604
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:14,067
No, but there was
that Earl that we...
There was that Earl.

605
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:15,865
I do hope
you're enjoying yourself.

606
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:17,873
Peter, why don't you
show them around?

607
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,474
Absolutely.
Would you like that?

608
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,634
Oh, it...
Charmed, I'm sure.

609
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:24,008
Should we hit
the buffet table first though?

610
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,445
No, Dad.
Because the stuff
looks great.

611
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:27,005
Remember,
we wanted to look around.

612
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,914
(CHUCKLING)
Yes, of course, of course,
blessed offspring.

613
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:31,284
Why don't we get a drink
and then we'll start inside?

614
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:32,854
SONDRA: Oh, okay.
Come.

615
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:40,461
Yes, I love this room here.
We often spend
evenings in here.

616
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:42,054
The English countryside!

617
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:45,394
It's elegant,
yet understated. I like that.

618
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:47,001
You've done wonders
with the place.

619
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,830
(CHUCKLES)
It brings to mind Trollope.

620
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:50,868
Oh, do you enjoy
reading Trollope, too?

621
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,499
No, no, not the author.
This was a girl I knew.

622
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:56,741
Well, come. Let's go upstairs
and have a look at the view.

623
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:57,801
Oh.

624
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,609
Would you quit fooling around!
What's wrong with you?

625
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,809
Try to pick up clues,
try to remember things.
I'm charming him.

626
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:05,354
I remember. I got
a mnemonic system that I use.

627
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:07,445
I use images, it's a trick.
Uh-huh, yeah.

628
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,047
Say I want to remember
this ashtray.

629
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:13,357
I think of, like, 50 ashtrays
dancing on a desert island
in hula skirts or something

630
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,723
and then I remember.
I can call it
to mind whenever I...

631
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:17,198
Where are you going?

632
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:19,535
This is
one of the drawing rooms.

633
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,931
Wow, this is
really beautiful, isn't it?

634
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,303
Oh, here we have...
This is my great-grandfather.

635
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:27,308
There's grandfather
and his wife, Lady Hayden.

636
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:30,539
Reminds me of
the portrait of Aunt Hillary
in the library, no?

637
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,280
Game woman, Hillary.
Suffragette, I believe.
Yeah. Diphtheria took her.

638
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:38,212
Or perhaps it was elm blight.

639
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:40,048
Come on, Dad.

640
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,755
SONDRA: Oh,
this is just beautiful. Wow.

641
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:45,351
Yes. I love the lake.
Do either of you fish?

642
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,521
No, no, never have.
Oh, I'll have to teach you.

643
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,028
I've taken some salmon,
you know. Organic.

644
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:52,792
Yes, me, too.
I fly fish a little. But...

645
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,162
So, Jade, do you
enjoy concerts?

646
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,932
I'm very big
on the Philharmonic.

647
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,405
We sponsor, in fact.

648
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,602
I used to play the violin,
very, very badly.

649
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:05,212
But I have a number of...
Well, actually quite a large
musical collection.

650
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,977
Do you play an instrument,
either of you?

651
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:08,346
Because we have
these lovely music gatherings.

652
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,612
I do. Yes, I play the...

653
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:10,674
(GRUNTS)

654
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:14,222
Various classics,
you know, Noel Coward
and Shakespeare and...

655
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:18,090
Right.
We gave her piano lessons
when she was a little girl,

656
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,959
but her fingers
were just too stubby. So...

657
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,294
Yes, what about you,
Mr. Spence?

658
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,291
Well, I play the blues harp.

659
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,731
It's a little metal thing
you put in your mouth

660
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,101
and makes a twanging sound.
Very musical.
Yes, yes.

661
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:33,403
Used to be called
the Jew's harp, but you know
how those people are.

662
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:36,070
The slightest hint
of anti-Semitism
and they write letters.

663
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:39,645
I would love it if you could
teach me how to fly fish.
That would be great.

664
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:40,910
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

665
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:45,482
Okay, I want you to
watch me very closely. Pay
very strict attention here.

666
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:47,055
Now I want you
to take a card.

667
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:48,614
Take any card you like.
You got it?

668
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,386
Go ahead, sweetheart. Take it.
You got it?
Mmm-hmm.

669
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,086
Now put it
in your pocketbook.
Put the card...

670
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:53,355
She's gonna put the card
in her pocketbook.

671
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,557
You got it? All right,
now tell everybody
what the card was.

672
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,489
It was the six of hearts.
Six of hearts.

673
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:58,623
Can I ask you a question?

674
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,727
Was it
this six of hearts?

675
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,265
But I just put that
in my bag.

676
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:04,568
Well, check your card.
Check your card.

677
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,263
It's amazing!

678
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,771
You're
a wonderful sport, Claire.

679
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:10,574
I mean that sincerely.
God bless you.

680
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:13,047
You're a very sweet woman,
and this has been
a great group.

681
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,313
From the bottom of my heart,
I say this with
all due respect.

682
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,989
You're a wonderful... A credit
to your race and a
magnificent group of people.

683
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:22,820
You know,
I must find out who
does the hedges here.

684
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,588
Back home,
my topiary moose

685
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,958
is starting
to look a little shabby
around the antlers.

686
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,827
(LAUGHING) What do you do,
Mr. Spence?

687
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:30,798
(STUTTERING) Me?
I'm in real estate.

688
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:32,567
I'm sorry, I'm in oil!
I'm in oil.

689
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,297
(STUTTERING) I was in
real estate,

690
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:39,206
but, you know, land is
so difficult to come by now,
especially outdoors.

691
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,436
It's become a problem.

692
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,172
Incidentally,
I accept your invitation.

693
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,110
I will play poker
this weekend.

694
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:49,548
Now that I've seen
how good you are
at cards, can we trust you?

695
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,083
(LAUGHING)

696
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,916
Tell me about yourself, Peter.
This is all so new to me.

697
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,514
Well, what would you
like to know?

698
00:34:56,726 --> 00:35:00,092
Well, I don't know.
Anything you'd care to reveal.

699
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,992
You know, your hopes,
your dreams.

700
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:08,101
Well, I come
from a privileged family,
as I'm sure you can tell.

701
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:11,034
It was always
decided one day
I would enter politics.

702
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:15,567
My hobbies are polo
and... Oh, I own
some racehorses.

703
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:18,239
Hmm.
So, how's that for a start?

704
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,677
(CHUCKLES)
And what are
your hopes and dreams?

705
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:25,277
I like to dance
and visit museums

706
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,550
and, oh,
I can cook Chinese food.
Ah.

707
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:30,018
If you know any good
Chinese restaurants...

708
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:36,126
Oh, I've gotten very
interested in New Age
phenomena recently.

709
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,257
Like what?

710
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:42,331
You know,
mystical things like

711
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:47,739
astrology and crystals
and Tarot.
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:50,070
Do you know anything
about Tarot cards?

713
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:52,474
Not really.
I'm more scientific-minded.

714
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:54,039
I find that if...

715
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,244
What are you staring at?

716
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:59,679
Hmm? Oh.

717
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,853
You have wonderful enamel.

718
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,987
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.
Thank you.

719
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,655
You know, I'd love to take
you dancing one night.
I'm a good dancer.

720
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:10,259
Oh, I would love that.
That would be great.

721
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,030
Can I confess something?

722
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:13,391
Sure.

723
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:14,798
I just love
an American accent,

724
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,065
and I find
much of what you say
very amusing.

725
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:18,262
Oh.

726
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,204
I'll take that
as a compliment.

727
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,039
And since you like
Chinese food,

728
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:23,976
I'm gonna have
my new secretary

729
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:26,173
send you a list
of the great ones in town.

730
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,782
Oh, you have a new secretary?
Oh, yes.

731
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:31,547
Yes, I'm breaking in
someone new.

732
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:35,148
My previous secretary died,
a young woman, just very
suddenly of a blood clot.

733
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:36,317
It was awful.

734
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:39,393
Did they do an autopsy?

735
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,396
How did we
get on to this morbid subject?

736
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,364
So, you've never seen
a real English garden before?

737
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,697
Come.
I have a couple of treasures.

738
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:15,123
Would I offend you
if I told you something?
Probably not.

739
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:19,601
You're very...
Very different from
the women I usually meet.

740
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:20,657
Hmm.

741
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:22,331
That's a good thing.

742
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:25,568
Well, I just can't seem to get
the vision of you in your
swimsuit out of my mind.

743
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:26,972
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

744
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:28,201
It was marked down.

745
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:31,007
(CHUCKLES) See, that...
Now that's exactly
what I mean.

746
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,380
You just have this very direct
and informal way about you.

747
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:37,146
It's...
You take after your father.
Mmm-hmm. Great.

748
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:40,914
And you have
a very sensual quality.

749
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:43,114
It's... But I'm sure
you've been told that.

750
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,552
Wow. You work really fast.

751
00:37:45,894 --> 00:37:48,090
Oh, God. Am I
overbearingly aggressive?
I'll stop.

752
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:49,561
Oh, no, don't!

753
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,463
You just
were getting warmed up.

754
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,264
Are you romantic by nature?

755
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,530
I mean, I won't say,
"Do you believe in
love at first sight?"

756
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:57,197
Because that's
a cliché but...

757
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:00,967
Have you ever had
an experience

758
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,235
where a bell goes off
just right away?

759
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,777
(LAUGHS) Sorry.
I need those.

760
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,409
You see,
I can't wear contacts.

761
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:09,679
I don't like
to put my finger
on my eyeball.

762
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,650
(BOTH LAUGHING)

763
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:22,088
Well, goodbye. We must meet
for tea and crumpets again.

764
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,153
WOMAN: We really must.

765
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,460
Ta-ta!

766
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,565
I could have strangled you
if you didn't shut up!

767
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,065
And stop telling people
I sprang from your loins.

768
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:33,005
I'm trying to cement the fact
that I'm your father!

769
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:35,943
That guy was so fantastic.
I can't imagine
he'd do anything bad.

770
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,980
This guy
is not a serial killer,
believe me.

771
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:42,072
I'd be very surprised
if he even killed one person.

772
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:44,079
He asked me to go dancing
next week.

773
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:48,246
That's a perfect strategy!
You worm your way in
like a rodent or a roach

774
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,416
and as the crumbs
fall off the table,

775
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:53,586
you collect them and
we analyze them. Aha! Voila!
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

776
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:56,530
Look at this. Look at this.
Look what I got.
"Betty G."

777
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,088
Yeah.
What is this?

778
00:38:58,168 --> 00:38:59,726
It's a doodle.
He doodled it!

779
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:02,331
How do you know
he doodled it? How do
you know this is his?

780
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:03,632
What do you mean,
how do I know it's his?

781
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:05,231
I stole it out of
his overnight bag.

782
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:07,070
What the hell
is wrong with you, Sidney?

783
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,371
It's a clue!
It's not a clue.

784
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:09,911
We're hard up for clues.
It's not a clue.

785
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,777
What does it mean?
It could be his aunt,
it could be his travel agent.

786
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:15,282
I'm late for dinner. You want
to come in and eat something?
No.

787
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:16,974
(CHUCKLES) No, thank you.

788
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:23,621
Take a seat right over there.

789
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:26,786
(MEN CHATTERING)

790
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,088
MAN 1: Okay.

791
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,297
Peter called.
He's going to be late.
He said to start without him.

792
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,335
Oh, well, come on
then, let's play.
That's what we're here for.

793
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,032
Okay.

794
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,608
MAN 2: Come on,
short, little guy.

795
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:45,740
You're out?
This is it?

796
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:47,510
MAN 3: Anybody else?

797
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,050
You're still in?

798
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:52,349
So sorry, old chaps.
I was completely
bogged down at the office.

799
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:53,581
Okay.

800
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:54,884
All right, who's winning?

801
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,858
Mr. Spence
is a good poker player, Peter.

802
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,483
Yes, I might have known.

803
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:02,688
Actually,
I bought my first Reuben's
with poker winnings.

804
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,829
You bought a Rubens painting?

805
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,460
Not a painting.
A sandwich.

806
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:09,702
I could use a drink.

807
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:12,768
He asked me
if I believed in love
at first sight.

808
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,775
(EXCLAIMS)
How sweet is that?
So naive.

809
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,208
Well, I hope
you told him yes.

810
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:17,768
I told him
we had nothing in common.

811
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:20,007
We come from
completely different
backgrounds.

812
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,606
I think
he likes that or something.

813
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:25,483
But what about the story
you're writing on him?
What is that all about?

814
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:29,983
Sondra?

815
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:38,699
"Mary Thompson,
a short-haired brunette,

816
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:42,534
"was strangled
at Falconberg Place
last night at 9:30."

817
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,664
"Next to the body
of the short-haired
brunette prostitute,

"was the hangman card

819
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:52,570
Hey, what time did you say
Peter arrived at the
poker game last night?

820
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,077
If you're asking me,
did he have time
to strangle somebody

821
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,746
and make the card game,
yes, he had plenty of time.

822
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,286
I got to let
my feelings subside

823
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,326
and probe deeper
into this case.

824
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:05,791
What does that mean?

825
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:09,255
Well, it means that we know
where his family lives,
we know his social circle,

826
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:12,824
but we don't know
what his house looks like.
I want to get a look at that.

827
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:20,802
PETER: Here we are.

828
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,641
Wow.
This is really nice.
Thank you. Yes.

829

Do you do
a lot of entertaining?

830
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:31,452
I'm embarrassed
to say that I do.

831
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,217
You must think
I'm an empty socialite.
Much of it's political.

832
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,485
Oh, no.
I think you're swell.

That's a lovely painting.

from my art history books.

PETER: Oh, really?
Yes. Henry Moore.

836
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:50,733
In fact, it was a present
from Henry Moore to my father.

837
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:55,273
Oh, it's very beautiful.
Is it Roman, or Greek,
or something like that?

838
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:59,405
It's Roman, in fact.
Second century A.D.

839
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,813
You have good taste.

what's downstairs.

Oh.

is climate controlled, it's

to protect
all these beautiful pieces.

00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,686
It's fantastic.
Thank you. Thank you.

Yes, my family's been
collecting it for years.

This is a Guarneri.
And a Stradivarius.
You may have heard of them.

Oh, you play these violins?
Oh, me? God, no. No, no.

851

But we lend them out.
They need to be played.

it's very romantic.

Yes. Yes.

No, I haven't.

molecules broken up?
No, no, I've haven't.

It's Yardley.

but quite difficult.

please me more. Come on.

get back to the story.

dematerializer trick

with this chick
from Manchester.

I don't know
where they get these people,

912
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:00,844
but she looked like
Sitting Bull.

913
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:03,507
And I got her in the thing,
and I vanish her

914
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:07,043
and everything
goes according to plan
exactly and she's gone.

Strombel appears.
What?

from the audience.

I could do it every night!

the combination to a safe.

And what is your persuasion?

982
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:03,829
Do you mean my religion?
Yeah, your persuasion.

983
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:05,730
I'm a Christian. What are you?
Yes, are you?

984
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:08,929
(STUTTERING)
Me, I was born into
the Hebrew persuasion,

985
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,735
but, when I got older,
I converted to narcissism.

Hmm?

987
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:16,067
Dad, I need
to talk to you right now.

988
00:50:16,144 --> 00:50:19,478
Oh, I was just about
to pull some quarters
out of Mrs. Quincy's nose.

989
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:21,309
Right now.
I need to talk to you.

990
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,405
Really?
Yep.

991
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,146
Excuse me. I'll...

992
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,380
Where?

993
00:50:27,523 --> 00:50:29,320
Would you stop doing
those nitwit tricks?

994
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:31,690
What is wrong with you?
You're supposed to be
a dignified businessman.

995
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,695
I told them it was a hobby.
The hobby of a rich merchant.

996
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:35,788
You know, so...

997
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:38,128
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

998
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,994
Go down the stairs,
open the music room door.
I'll keep Peter busy.

00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,505
I'll meet you down there
in a minute. You brought
the combination, right?

1000
00:50:44,572 --> 00:50:46,164
No, I left it
in my other jacket.

1001
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:47,402
What?
Yes. And...

1002
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:49,501
So, what are we gonna do?
You gotta go home
and get it then.

1003
00:50:49,577 --> 00:50:52,570
I can't get it
because the other
jacket's in the cleaners.

1004
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,980
Sidney.
This is the problem
having a limited wardrobe.

1005
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,313
But not to worry.

1006
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:59,286

I remember everything.

There you are. Mr. Spence,
trust you're having
a good time?

1008
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:05,391
(STUTTERING) Yes,
a great time! This
reminds me of our party.

1009
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,862
We threw a masked ball in
Palm Beach this year,
it was wonderful.

1010

I came as a harlequin.
She dressed as Petunia Pig.

1011
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:14,436
Honey, there's something
I wanted to ask you about.
Absolutely.

1012
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:18,496
That was a mask, wasn't it?
Just... I love her.
Just a minute, okay?

1013
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:21,742
Do you need a drink,
Mr. Spence?
No, I'm fine, thank you.

owns a deck of Tarot cards.
That's not a crime.

I mean, what, he was late
for a poker game?

to have an alibi.

short-cut, brunette hair.

if we blow the whistle
on this guy...

I know. I understand.
...and he's innocent
and we can't make the story...

that you're, you know,

you're a pushy little phony
who's been playing him
for a sucker

and he dumps you,
you know. I get it.

1099
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:43,313
All right. All I'm saying,
is that in order to make
an accusation,

1100
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:44,409

to break it.

are you crying?

do become congested

01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:30,320
No, no, it's okay.

1144
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:32,326
I don't really have
much of an appetite.

1145
01:00:32,494 --> 01:00:35,257
But you will when
they bring out the prawns
in hydrochloric acid.

1146
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:37,025
It's fantastic, Sondra.

1147
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,233
What's the matter?

1148
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:42,235
What,
are you thinking of Peter?
No.

1149
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,168
I don't know, it's just...

1150
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:46,706
I wouldn't be surprised
if he asked me to marry him
one day, you know?

1151
01:00:46,775 --> 01:00:49,402
You come
from an Orthodox family.

1152
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,878
Would they accept
a serial killer?

1153
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,342
That's an expensive present.

1154
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:58,851
The Lymans are so wealthy.
Yes.

1155
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,682
It was almost
too extravagant.

1156
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:04,251
I'd better get ready.
I still haven't found
my millionaire yet.

1157
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:06,516
(SIGHS)

1158
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:10,097
Oh, God, Sondra, what a mess!

1159
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,630
It's starting to add up
against him.

1160
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,465
Bits and scraps
are coming together.

1161
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:16,936
God, it's you!

1162
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:19,733
I sensed
you were falling in love.
I escaped again.

1163
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,469
It's just circumstantial junk,
you know. A coincidence
here and there.

1164
01:01:23,545 --> 01:01:25,570
Too much smoke
not to be fire.

1165
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:28,012
Look, I'm sure
you've been wrong
plenty of times.

1166
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,242
Not wrong here.

1167
01:01:29,317 --> 01:01:32,775
Though I agree
you haven't got enough
to pull the trigger yet.

1168
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:35,184
If you act prematurely,
not only does he walk,

1169
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:38,351
your professional credibility
is wrecked,
sometimes for good.

1170
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,360
Oh, I'm sure you want him
to be guilty.

1171
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:42,487
You know, that way you get
your last big scoop.

1172
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:43,996
I'm beginning to fade.

1173
01:01:44,065 --> 01:01:45,896
Sondra, don't let me down!

1174
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,059
I wish you'd fade for good!

1175
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:49,396
Get out of my life!

1176
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:50,903
I'm not
cut out for this.

1177
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:53,496
I should be
flossing molars for a living.

1178
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:57,239
The bread is... You know,
I can make a meal
just with the bread.

1179
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:59,211
I can do a whole meal,
just nothing but bread.

1180
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:02,246
If I ate that much bread,
I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

1181
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:04,181
See,
I never gain an ounce,

1182
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:08,382
because, you know,
my anxiety acts like aerobics.

1183
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,056
So I get the exercise.

1184
01:02:10,891 --> 01:02:13,588
Thanks for taking me out
for my birthday, Sidney.

1185
01:02:13,695 --> 01:02:16,186
Well, you know,
you're the daughter
that I never had.

1186
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:18,255
Oh, that's so...
No, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1187
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,731
'Cause I never wanted
to have kids.

1188
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:22,432
I didn't.
Because you have kids,
what is it?

1189
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:25,536
You know, you're nice
to them, you bring
them up, you suffer,

1190
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,097
you take care of them

1191
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:31,612
and then they grow up
and they accuse you
of having Alzheimer's.

1192
01:02:32,146 --> 01:02:33,739
Could you
ever live in London?

1193
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:36,784
Could I live
in London? No.

1194
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:39,047
And I love London.
Don't get me wrong,
I love London,

1195
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,315
but, you know,

1196
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:45,353
apart from
the language problem,
I can't take the driving.

1197
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:48,487
Because it, you know,
it's on the wrong side,
and I...

1198
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:50,726
Every time
I drive a car here,

1199
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:53,063
I'm convinced
I'm going to die in a crash.

1200
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:55,391
Sidney!

1201
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,559
What's the matter?

1202
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:58,501
It's Peter.

1203
01:02:58,572 --> 01:02:59,630
You said
Peter was out of town.

1204
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,539
Well, that's
what he told me.

1205
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,099
Come on.

1206
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,539
What do you mean, come on?

1207
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:06,773
(STUTTERING)
I ordered prawns.

1208
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:09,074
Just pay, all right?
Just pay.

1209
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:11,443
What do you mean, pay?
All I do is...

1210
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,612
Fine, it's her birthday.

1211
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:17,949
Come on.

1212
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,487
Maybe he's got
another woman on the side,

1213
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:23,563
and he likes you,
but he's sexually
attracted to her.

1214
01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:25,025
Thanks, Sidney.

1215
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,726
Well, why doesn't he have
his chauffeur?

1216
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,769
I don't know,
whatever he's doing,
he must want it to be secret.

1217
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:08,072
Oh, I told you
he went the other way!

1218
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:10,135
Can we go home, please?

1219
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:11,974
It's starting to rain.

1220
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:14,447
(GROANS) I can't believe
he lied to me.

1221
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:18,346
Maybe he's doing
something that he's ashamed
to tell you about.

1222
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,288
Maybe he belongs to
one of those clubs, or he's
a cross-dresser or something.

1223
01:04:22,356 --> 01:04:24,518
Or maybe
he does folk dancing.

1224
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:27,059
Oh, I'm sure
it's probably something
that when he tells me,

1225
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,152
I'll just feel foolish
for thinking he lied.

1226
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:32,461
I'm sure. You know,
not everything in
this world is sinister.

1227
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,297
You know,
just practically everything.

1228
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:37,202
(GROANS) That Indian food
made me sick.

1229
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:40,764
You hardly touched
your cobra salad.
How can you be sick?

1230
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,804
WOMAN: (SCREAMING) Help!

1231
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:45,539
A woman's been strangled!

1232
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:50,449
Help!
A woman's been strangled!
Help, call the police!

1233
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:52,509
MAN: Somebody call the police!
There's been a murder!

1234
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:53,884
WOMAN 2: There's been
a murder upstairs.

1235
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:54,943
WOMAN 1: Help!

1236
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:57,047
MAN: Have you got a phone?
Have you got a phone?
Call the police.

1237
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,922
Could it be the Tarot Killer?
They found a Tarot card.
It's him.

1238
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:01,393
I can't believe it!
She lives in this building.

1239
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:03,623
It's him again.
They found the Tarot card.

1240
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:08,099
Elizabeth Gibson,
another short-haired brunette.

1241
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:10,896
(SIGHS) We should have
gone to the police earlier.

1242
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:14,032
Well, you know...
You said that they
wouldn't believe us

1243
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:16,304
and they may not.

1244
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:20,135
Sidney, it's about time
we show my story to
a real newspaperman.

1245
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:22,614
By real, you mean what?

1246
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:23,876
One that's living.

1247
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,083
Vivian's father has a friend
that works at The Observer

1248
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:31,054
Well, it's very vivid
and rather shocking,

1249
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,958
and there are some
genuine circumstantial
bits of evidence.

1250
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:37,760
But let me give you a lesson
in professional journalism.

1251
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:42,561
No newspaper should
or would ever run this story.

1252
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:44,795
What? Why?

1253
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,568
It would be
fatally irresponsible
and libelous.

1254
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:52,179
All you have here
are a number
of titillating speculations.

1255
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:56,744
Flamboyant theories that
tarnish a man, and a
well-known figure at that,

1256
01:05:56,818 --> 01:05:59,378
without a single shred
of substantial proof.

1257
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,682
So his mother
was a short-haired brunette.

1258
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:04,655
So he came late
for a poker game

1259
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:08,286
and said he was going away
on a business trip
and he got caught lying.

1260
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:13,362
Yes, but who keeps
a Tarot deck under
a French horn?

1261
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:18,195
It's not against the law
to own a Tarot deck,
or keep it wherever you like.

1262
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:21,938
You'd look
pretty foolish in court
with your accusations,

1263
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,637
and that's
where you'll wind up.

1264
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:27,003
Because he'd have no choice
but to sue you
and the newspaper,

1265
01:06:27,081 --> 01:06:28,208
and he'd win.

1266
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,014
And to go to the police?

1267
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:32,045
I'll come to that.

1268
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:35,282
But first let me
continue my tedious
professorial lecture.

1269
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:39,184
Vivian's dad and I
go way back.

1270
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,686
He said you were
a journalism student.

1271
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:43,452
Hmm.

1272
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:46,090
You talk about getting a tip.

1273
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,132
Okay, you won't
disclose your source,

1274
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:51,331
but what you have done
is let your imagination
run wild.

1275
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:52,530
No, no.

1276
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:56,168
What if I told you
that my source happened
to be a certain Joe Strombel?

1277
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:58,710
The late Joe Strombel?
Yep.

1278
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,213
You mean, before he died
he gave a student reporter

1279
01:07:01,282 --> 01:07:03,614
a major story
and didn't follow
it up himself?

1280
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:06,380
We didn't say
it was before he died.

1281
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:08,887
What?
No, it...

1282
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:10,514
He got the story
before he died,

1283
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:13,025
and then he died
before he could follow it up.

1284
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:18,027
(CHUCKLES) Well,
why did he give it to you?
He didn't know he was dying.

1285
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,492
I don't buy it.

1286
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,125
I knew Joe Strombel well.

1287
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:23,800
If he'd had a tip
that he considered reliable,

1288
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:26,463
he would certainly
have pursued it himself,

1289
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,440
from the grave,
if necessary.

1290
01:07:29,643 --> 01:07:32,442
What about how Peter
was in the neighborhood

1291
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:34,539
the night
the murder was committed?

1292
01:07:34,648 --> 01:07:35,637
(CLEARS THROAT)

1293
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,115
I realize as a student
how exciting it must have been

1294
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:40,813
to think that you were onto
something so spectacular.

1295
01:07:40,954 --> 01:07:42,422
Hey, she is onto something!

1296
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:44,548
This kid is a bloodhound.
Look at her!

1297
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:48,152
She could sell the story
to any tabloid in town.

1298
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:49,786
Hmm.

1299
01:07:50,731 --> 01:07:53,860
Now that I've preached
on the realities
of accurate reporting,

1300
01:07:53,934 --> 01:07:57,961
I want to tell you
how catastrophic
for everybody involved

1301
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,166
it would have been
if you had, say, taken

1302
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,369
the results
of your investigation
to a tabloid.

1303
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:08,273
Today, the police
have apprehended
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1304
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:11,646
And it most assuredly
is not Peter Lyman.

1305
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:13,380
What?

1306
01:08:13,454 --> 01:08:16,548
Every paper in town
is going to press
with it as we speak.

1307
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:21,155
It was a handyman
named Henry Banks
who has confessed.

1308
01:08:21,863 --> 01:08:25,025
Banks is a delusional paranoid
who's given Scotland Yard

1309
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,761
information
that only the killer
could possibly know.

1310
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:30,399
He's led the police
to two additional bodies

1311
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:34,305
and his DNA
and a fingerprint
they found check out.

1312
01:08:35,409 --> 01:08:37,640
I know
this puts a crimp
in your scoop,

1313
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,243
but Henry Banks is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1314
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:43,640
Not Lord Lyman's son.

1315
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,150
Well, I can't say
I'm not walking on air.

1316
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:52,253
Oh, Jesus, If I ever catch
that Joe Strombel,
I'll kill him.

1317
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:54,318
I only hope
Peter forgives me
for what I've done.

1318
01:08:54,395 --> 01:08:55,487
For what?

1319
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:57,497
I lied to him.
I'm not Jade Spence.

1320
01:08:57,564 --> 01:09:01,001
I'm a pushy,
duplicitous, ambitious
college student.

1321
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,057
I lied to him,
over and over.

1322
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,502
Darling, he lied to you, too,
so it's even.

1323
01:09:04,572 --> 01:09:07,972
His lies pale in comparison
to the enormity
of what I've done.

1324
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:11,536
So marry him
as Jade Spence.
Don't tell him.

1325
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:14,945
(STUTTERING) You know,
you don't have to be
Sondra Pransky ever again.

1326
01:09:15,015 --> 01:09:16,448
Marry him as Jade Spence.

1327
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,543
Yeah, but I don't want to
have to get you a
Father's Day gift every year.

1328
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:24,518
You know, I don't know how to
break this to you, honey,
but you were adopted. Okay?

1329
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:26,525
Your mother and I,
we were at the orphanage,

1330
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,891
we wanted
a handicapped child, and...

1331
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:32,292
Ah, finally.
Just you and I all weekend.

1332
01:09:32,432 --> 01:09:33,421
Yeah.

1333
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:36,894
I thought you'd like it here.

1334
01:09:37,104 --> 01:09:38,435
It's lovely.
Mmm-hmm.

1335
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:42,703
Peter?
Yes.

1336
01:09:42,777 --> 01:09:45,301
I have
a confession to make.
Oh, God, so do I.

1337
01:09:45,813 --> 01:09:47,804
Oh, well, let me go first.

1338
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:49,782
Actually, no,
let me, please,

1339
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,148
because mine's
been bothering me all day.

1340
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:52,582
I just want
to get it off my chest.

1341
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:56,420
When I told you I was
going away for a few days
on business,

1342
01:09:56,557 --> 01:09:58,890
I was lying.

1343
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:01,717
I know.
You know? How?

1344
01:10:02,396 --> 01:10:04,456
Oh, I saw you.
You saw me? No.

1345
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:07,198
I was at dinner, and...
With your father?

1346
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:10,832
Actually...
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter. Really.

1347
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:15,108
The truth is,
that a company my father owns

1348
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:16,837
is about to merge
with a company
in the Middle East.

1349
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:18,878
It's a very
sensitive situation,

1350
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,641
and the less
anyone knows about it,
the better.

1351
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:22,306
And we just didn't want
the press to sniff it out.

1352
01:10:22,382 --> 01:10:23,577
I mean,
that's no excuse, really.

1353
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,983
I'm just very sorry
for the extreme secrecy.

1354
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:29,113
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm glad.

1355
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:32,921
It's your own
secret information.
That's fine.

1356
01:10:32,993 --> 01:10:35,257
So your father took you out
for a birthday dinner

1357
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,024
and you saw me.
I mean, how unnerving.

1358
01:10:37,097 --> 01:10:39,930
God, I mean, the thing
I hate most in the world
is lying.

1359
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:42,194
Uh-huh.

1360
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:43,895
What?

1361
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:46,971
Peter...
Yes, Jade?

1362
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:49,532
Peter...

1363
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,703
Oh, yes.
What did you want to tell me?

1364
01:10:51,845 --> 01:10:52,869
Uh...

1365
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:54,710
Jade, there's nothing
you can tell me that...

1366
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:57,079
My name is not Jade Spence.

1367
01:10:58,118 --> 01:10:59,449
It's not?

1368
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:02,480
No. It's Sondra Pransky.

1369
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:06,720
And my father
is not my father.
His name is Sidney Waterman.

1370
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:08,694
He's a magician
called Splendini.

1371
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:10,287
I'm a journalism student.

1372
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:15,063
Don't ask me
what kind of crazy
misinformation we received

1373
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:17,069
to believe you might be
the Tarot Card Killer.

1374
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:21,301
(STUTTERING) I mean,
I didn't know you
at this time. Remember?

1375
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:24,609
And, of course,
as soon as I got to know you,

1376
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,011
I knew that
it couldn't possibly be true.

1377
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:29,207
And the police have him now,
so everything's fine.

1378
01:11:29,716 --> 01:11:32,117
Of course,
along the route
I fell for you,

1379
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,814
and now
I totally blew it, and...

1380
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:36,287
Who told you this?

1381
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,952
Oh, a newspaperman.
He's now deceased.

1382
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,757
Very foolish.
He was eager
for his last scoop.

1383
01:11:42,963 --> 01:11:45,488
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just

1384
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:49,192
totally understand
if you never want to
speak to me again

1385
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,135
or if you
don't want to see me...
Miss Pransky.

1386
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:54,297
Not only am I
not angry with you, but you...

1387
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:58,606
(LAUGHS) You've
absolutely made my day!
What?

1388
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,046
Just suspecting
that I could be such
an imaginative,

1389
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:02,742
dramatic fiend.
I love it.

1390
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:03,841
You do?
Yes.

1391
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,579
I think it's one of the
funniest, craziest things
I've ever heard in my life.

1392
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:08,087
I can't wait
to tell the chaps
at the club.

1393
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:09,983
(CHUCKLING)
Peter?

1394
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:11,149
Yes, darling.

1395
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:14,859
I have to ask you something.
Yes, anything. Absolutely.

1396
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:19,759
Why did you hide
that Tarot deck
in your music room?

1397
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,301
How do you
know about that?

1398
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:28,907
I was so paranoid. I...
It's crazy.

1399
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:32,069
But I snuck in.
Oh, dear, it was going to be
a surprise.

1400
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:34,613
I bought them for you.
They're Victorian Tarot cards.

1401
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:36,649
You told me
you were into
that kind of thing.

1402
01:12:36,717 --> 01:12:37,775
What? Oh...
It was gonna be
a gift for you.

1403
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:40,184
Oh, you're so...
I feel like such an idiot!

1404
01:12:40,253 --> 01:12:42,654
Darling, no, no, no,
never mind, never mind.
What a shame.

1405
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,453
Let's forget about it.
No...

1406
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:46,122
Huh? Let's just...

1407
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:50,024
Now that we've confessed
our sins, let's move on
with our lives, huh?

1408
01:12:50,097 --> 01:12:52,497
Really?
Yeah. I want to hear
all about the real you.

1409
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:55,162
And I assure you in advance,
I'll love it.

1410
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:57,030
(MOANING) Oh, God,

1411
01:12:57,104 --> 01:13:00,198
you snuck into
my music room, did you?

1412
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:03,907
So the reason
why he was skulking around,

1413
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:05,842
was 'cause he had
this private family business

1414
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:08,244
which is too delicate
to discuss, actually.

1415
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,780
Sorry, I don't buy it.

1416
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:12,952
What?
The man
is a liar and a murderer.

1417
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,680
And I say that
with all due respect.

1418
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:17,020
Sidney.
Child, I know
what I'm talking about.

1419
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:18,319
Don't call me that, all right?

1420
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,384
Do you remember
when we were out
on the estate,

1421
01:13:20,528 --> 01:13:22,552
I found a clue,
you thought I was nuts?

1422
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,530
I thought you were nuts
so many times I can't
recall the exact one.

1423
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,728
Do you remember this?
Do you remember this
little item? This clue?

1424
01:13:28,935 --> 01:13:31,268
Yes, Betty G.
Yes, Betty G.

1425
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:35,034
Now, I checked
all the girls
that were murdered.

1426
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:38,573
The one that was killed
the night we saw Peter
on the street, was named

1427
01:13:38,645 --> 01:13:41,113
(CLEARS THROAT)
Elizabeth Gibson.

1428
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:42,907
So?

1429
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:46,247
So Betty
is short for Elizabeth
a lot of times.

1430
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:49,380
Oh, come on, Sidney.
That's a real stretch.
You're reaching now.

1431
01:13:49,457 --> 01:13:53,587
Look, supposing you wanted
to rub somebody out
and not get caught.

1432
01:13:53,661 --> 01:13:55,958
Nobody wants
to get caught, Sidney.

1433
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:57,019
Look,

1434
01:13:57,097 --> 01:14:00,931
he wants to get rid of
Elizabeth Gibson.
Betty Gibson. Betty Gibson.

1435
01:14:01,002 --> 01:14:03,162
So, there's
a series of murders

1436
01:14:03,237 --> 01:14:06,637
with a guy that's got
a real style. A Tarot card.

1437
01:14:06,707 --> 01:14:08,333
They said
he was a total maniac.

1438
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:11,502
He buys a Tarot deck
and let's say he hides it.

1439
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:14,445
Hypothetically,
he hides it, let's say,
in a music room.

1440
01:14:14,515 --> 01:14:16,813
Let's say he hides it in,
let's say, a French horn.
Oh, Sidney.

1441
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:19,681
In a French horn!
I'm losing patience with you.

1442
01:14:19,753 --> 01:14:21,914
I'm not saying the guy
did all the murders.

1443
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:24,617
I'm saying that he just did
Elizabeth Gibson,

1444
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:28,787
then folded it into the series
of the Tarot Killer
so he wouldn't get caught.

1445
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:31,161
Henry Banks
confessed to all the murders.

1446
01:14:31,231 --> 01:14:33,564
Henry Banks is deranged!
He hallucinates!

1447
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:34,622
My God.

1448
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:37,703
Henry... And you know
those guys like to brag
when they get caught.

1449
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:39,863
Henry Banks, you know...

1450
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,570
Where are you going? The cops
will dump every unsolved
murder on Henry Banks.

1451
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:46,545
They haven't
caught anybody in years.

1452
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:49,511
Peter wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh, really?

1453
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,381
What about a fly who speaks?

1454
01:14:52,286 --> 01:14:53,445
What?
Yes.

1455
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,613
Why would Peter
kill a prostitute?

1456
01:14:55,957 --> 01:14:58,118
Because it looks terrible
on his resume.

1457
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:00,819
Who knows what kind of
sordid life this guy has?

1458
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:03,420
Have you
completely lost your mind?
What is wrong with you?

1459
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,626
Peter being
blackmailed by a prostitute?
It's ridiculous.

1460
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:08,292
What are you putting
in your Metamucil?

1461
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:10,367
You know...
Where are you going?

1462
01:15:10,438 --> 01:15:13,668
You don't understand!
It would kill his reputation!

1463
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,402

Can I just tell you one thing?

Joe Strombel
would not agree with you.

1467
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:24,917
I don't want to talk about
Joe Strombel, all right?

1468
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:26,850
Even a great reporter
can be wrong.

1469
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:28,751

Blackmail.
I see it all over.

1471
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:32,015
You are a cynical
crapehanger

1472
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,787
who always sees the glass
half-empty!

1473
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,954
No, you're wrong.
I see the glass half-full,
but of poison.

1474
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,328
And you're gonna wind up
drinking it!

1475
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,162
You don't know anything.
You don't have a reporter's
instincts, okay?

1476
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:43,600
You're some guy
who vanishes silk
handkerchiefs

1477
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:45,161
and cuts
people's neckties off.

1478
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:47,900
Do everybody a favor.
Go back to your card tricks,
all right?

1479
01:15:54,981 --> 01:15:56,243
Did you tell her?

1480
01:15:56,716 --> 01:15:58,047
I did. I told her.

1481
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:01,520
And I made it seem
as though it all suddenly
just came to me.

1482
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:02,715
I know I'm right.

1483
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,056
She just won't listen to me.
She hates me.

1484
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:06,319
Yeah. I...
You know,

1485
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,988
sometimes, I got to say,
I worry about that girl.

1486
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,555
I don't think
I'll be seeing you anymore.

1487
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:16,493
Well, if there's a scoop
to be had here,

1488
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:18,104
she's going
to get it for you.

1489
01:16:18,538 --> 01:16:20,802
You can only cheat death
so many times,

1490
01:16:21,274 --> 01:16:23,140
and I've used
every trick I know.

1491

You look after her.
She's a decent kid.

I hardly ever saw her

I knew
what she did for a living.

entertain her clients here,
or not, I couldn't say.

very worth your while,

Mmm-hmm,

that she deserved to die.

1523

You know.
Not that you'd know
that from those pictures.

1524
01:18:43,317 --> 01:18:46,184
She used to be a really
pretty baby-faced blonde.

Oh, no, I know, I know.

1528

She made the mistake
of cutting it off
and dyeing it black.

God knows why.

1530
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,722

one of her regulars.

this number to call.

Yes, one second.

Hi, Sidney.

I got a treasure trove
of information here.

On Elizabeth Gibson.

She's called Betty. Betty!
She's called Betty.

1552
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:14,195
And she had some kind of
a long relationship...

1553
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:17,904
A special relationship
with some young guy, Peter.

1554
01:20:17,978 --> 01:20:22,414
The last name
doesn't click,
but I'm sure it's the same.

1555
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:24,378
This is crazy.

1556
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:27,945
Look, stop making trouble,
Sidney. The case is closed.

1557
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:31,454
Listen, this thing adds up.

1558
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:36,125
You're alone up there with
a very, very dangerous man.

1559
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:37,854
That's two verys.

1560
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:40,692
You got to get back to town
right away.

1561
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,962
Sidney, if I thought there was
a shred of proof,

1562
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:46,268
I would never let
my personal feelings
get involved, all right?

1563
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,898
The truth is,
I'm crazy about the guy.

1564
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:51,671
I can't keep obsessing
over tantalizing
conspiracy theories.

1565
01:20:57,518 --> 01:21:00,385
You know, I'm sure
that he killed her

1566
01:21:00,453 --> 01:21:03,445
and made it look
like a Tarot killing.

1567
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,420
You know,
you don't see it because
you got stars in your eyes.

1568
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:11,028
Look, I don't...
This is crazy! I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

1569
01:21:11,097 --> 01:21:12,759
It's too upsetting for me,
all right?

1570
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:14,130
Let me have my nice weekend.

1571
01:21:14,201 --> 01:21:15,429
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

1572
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:17,697
Stop putting
these paranoid thoughts
in my head!

1573
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:21,635
Is Sidney okay?
Yes, yes.

1574
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,371
You know, I love Sidney,
I really do,

1575
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:26,935
but he's just...
He's got a part missing,
you know, he's crazy!

1576
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:28,275
Yes, really?
Mmm-hmm.

1577
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:29,372
Like what?

1578
01:21:29,984 --> 01:21:31,109
We'll talk about it later.

1579
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:32,708
Let me change, okay?
Mmm-Hmm.

1580
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:55,407
Yes? Oh, yes, sir.

1581
01:21:55,943 --> 01:22:00,003
Yes. My daughter
is in the country
with Mr. Lyman.

1582
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,207
And I'm gonna
be driving up there later
and she asked me

1583
01:22:03,283 --> 01:22:06,515
if I could pick up her red
cashmere sweater. She thinks
she left it upstairs.

1584
01:22:06,587 --> 01:22:07,679
Red cashmere?

1585
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:10,382
Yes, it's a red sweater.
It's a kind of a red,
tomato red,

1586
01:22:10,457 --> 01:22:12,515
like a fire engine.
A red. A rouge

1587
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:15,390
I understand, sir. Red.
Yes, yes.

1588
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:17,292
I'll see if I can find it.

1589
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:23,060
Sir?

1590
01:23:23,162 --> 01:23:26,256
(STUTTERING) Oh, I was just
checking out the Stradivarius.

1591
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:32,667
I play a few pieces myself
on the violin. Prokofiev
and Bartok, the Hot Canary

1592
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:36,038
But Mr. Lyman is the
only person to have the
combination to that room.

1593
01:23:36,109 --> 01:23:39,045
Yes, but he wanted
to share it with me
because, you know,

1594
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:40,579
in case something happened,

1595
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,581
you know,
life is very capricious.

1596
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:46,243
A stroke, a sudden embolism
or lightning...
You know I...

1597
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:48,612
Darling, I love you.
I mean that sincerely.

1598
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:51,988
You're a wonderful woman,
you're a tremendous servant
and a credit to your race.

1599
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:54,253
And I mean that. From
the bottom of my heart
I say that to you.

1600
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:55,851
I notice you didn't
get the red sweater.

1601
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:57,590
She probably left it
in another bedroom.

1602
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:59,859
You know,
she's got a little problem
with promiscuity.

1603
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:01,092
But...

1604
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:04,532
So, I'll be going.
I'll call you.
We'll have lunch.

1605
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:17,181
Mr. Lyman, sir, Mr. Spence
has been here and he's
been into the music room.

1606
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:19,247
What do you mean?

1607
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,511
A most unusual
sequence of events.

1608
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:23,851
Mr. Spence came by
looking for his
daughter's sweater.

1609
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:25,413
Said she'd requested it.

1610
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:27,721
Next thing I knew,
he was in the music room.

1611
01:24:28,228 --> 01:24:30,719
Sir, I think
he'd been drinking,
from his behavior.

1612
01:24:31,664 --> 01:24:33,962
Yes, yes.

1613
01:24:34,568 --> 01:24:37,162
Yes. Okay, Margaret,
thank you. Goodbye.

1614
01:24:38,305 --> 01:24:39,465
Is everything okay?

1615
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:42,407
Yes.
Yes, it will be.

1616
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:00,576
It's so nice
to be out here with you,
just away

1617
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:04,021
from the rest of the world
and...
Hmm.

1618
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:08,585
Yes, I often
come out here to read and,
well, and fish.

1619
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:10,152
There's trout in the lake.

1620
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:20,595
What are you thinking about?

1621
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:23,367
You really want to know?
Yes.

1622
01:26:25,878 --> 01:26:28,541
Just how ironic life is,
and tragic.

1623
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:30,344
Why?

1624
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:33,511
Well, that I met you
by rescuing you from drowning

1625
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,152
and found you
totally enchanting

1626
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:40,748
and now we've come full cycle
and, alas, you're going
to have to drown.

1627
01:26:43,796 --> 01:26:44,889
What?

1628
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:48,426
Oh, I imagine by now
Sidney's confirmed
that I killed Betty Gibson.

1629
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:51,095
I mean, in my own defense,
there really was
no other way out.

1630
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,436
At first I managed
to hide my identity from her,

1631
01:26:54,507 --> 01:26:56,668
but I saw her too many times
over the years

1632
01:26:57,944 --> 01:26:59,707
and she learned who I was,
and...

1633
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:02,408
Well, it became
a constant demand for money

1634
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:04,712
and I just
could not let that go on,
could I?

1635
01:27:05,752 --> 01:27:07,743
I mean, my whole life
and career

1636
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,654
would be
just hostage to her
moods at all times.

1637
01:27:12,893 --> 01:27:15,122
So, I studied
the Tarot case,

1638
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:17,527
I rehearsed my plan,
and, well, you know the rest.

1639
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:19,530
If you do something to me,
Sidney's gonna find out!

1640
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,725
He'll tell someone.

1641
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:23,360
No, no, no.
You see, you will go
in a boating accident,

1642
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:25,131
and Sidney will go
later tonight.

1643
01:27:25,572 --> 01:27:27,733
No one knows
of your relationship with him,

1644
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:30,699
because, after all,
you're not actually father
and daughter, are you?

1645
01:27:31,444 --> 01:27:34,505
And no one will think twice
to investigate the death
of some obscure vaud...

1646
01:27:34,581 --> 01:27:35,809
Are you listening?

1647
01:27:36,115 --> 01:27:37,980
No one will think twice
to investigate the death

1648
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:41,612
of some obscure vaudevillian
called Splendini, who is
really a stranger to me.

1649
01:27:42,355 --> 01:27:43,380
Help!

1650
01:27:43,457 --> 01:27:45,220
Help! Someone help me!

1651
01:27:52,164 --> 01:27:53,826
(CHUCKLES)

1652
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:55,759
Yes, very quiet, isn't it?

1653
01:27:59,072 --> 01:28:01,096
This is the advantage
of a private lake.

1654
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:07,180
Get off me!
Get off me!

1655
01:28:07,247 --> 01:28:08,235
(GRUNTS)

1656
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:10,242
Get off me!
Come...

1657
01:28:39,512 --> 01:28:41,140
(TIRES SCREECHING)

1658
01:28:41,213 --> 01:28:42,203

(PANTING)

1661
01:29:29,595 --> 01:29:31,222
(FEIGNING CRYING)
Yes, police.

1662
01:29:32,899 --> 01:29:36,300
Yes, this is Peter Lyman.
I need the police immediately.

1663
01:29:36,869 --> 01:29:38,860
At the Lyman estate.

1664
01:29:39,372 --> 01:29:42,967
There's been
a terrible boating accident.
A woman has drowned.

1665
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,738
It's awful.
Please come right away.

1666
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,301
Thank you. Thank you.

1667
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:51,014
(SIGHS)

1668
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,914
They think they know
where the body is.

1669
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:57,590
I'm so sorry, sir.

1670
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,489
When last I saw her,
she...

1671
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:08,724
She just said she wanted
to go out there to
communicate with nature.

1672
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,203
Just to think
she wanted some
peace and quiet and...

1673
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,663
She wasn't depressed,
or anything like that,
was she, sir?

1674
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,729
God, no. No.

1675
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:18,270
I mean, unless she was
keeping it from me.

1676
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:20,206
You heard no cries for help?

1677
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:23,738
No! No,
I was listening to music
in here, damn it.

1678
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:26,042
(SIGHS) It's just so ironic.

1679
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:27,244
Because the way
I first met her

1680
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:29,550
I rescued her
from drowning
in our club pool.

1681
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:32,113
And she was a very,
very weak swimmer.

1682
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,019
SONDRA: Hello?

1683
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:37,786
I was faking it at the pool
to get your attention.

1684
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:41,225
Actually, I used to be
captain of the Brooklyn
Community Swim Team.

1685
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,673
Fascinating observation.

1686
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,444
Lyman lost a cufflink
at the flat of a prostitute,

1687
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,988
who was later killed
by the Tarot Card Killer.

1688
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:07,684
Well, this upright chap
certainly enjoyed patronizing
some dodgy women.

1689
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:11,721
Unfortunately
for Elizabeth Gibson,
she elected to blackmail him.

1690
01:31:13,099 --> 01:31:15,123
It's a beautifully
written story

1691
01:31:15,268 --> 01:31:19,136
and one of the best bits
of investigative journalism
in a long time.

1692
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:21,474
And this paper
is proud to run it.

1693
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,940
Oh, I have to
share the credit
with Joe Strombel.

1694
01:31:24,243 --> 01:31:25,268
An inspiration,

1695
01:31:25,345 --> 01:31:27,711
who taught me more
than I could ever
explain to anyone.

1696
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,545
And to the late
Sidney Waterman.

1697
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:32,409
Splendini.

1698
01:31:32,551 --> 01:31:35,282
A nice guy who helped out
with the investigation

1699
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:37,983
and without whom
I never could have made it.

1700
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:41,882
Sidney, wherever you are,

1701
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,462
I'll never forget you.

1702
01:31:46,832 --> 01:31:47,697
WOMAN: How did you get here?

1703
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,158
Me?

1704
01:31:49,269 --> 01:31:52,966
I couldn't get used to driving
on the goddamn wrong
side of the street!

1705
01:31:53,038 --> 01:31:55,029
(STUTTERING) You know,
I was driving up
to the country,

1706
01:31:55,108 --> 01:31:58,042
and in the United States,
I would have been a hero.
I would have saved her.

1707
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,100
I would have...

1708
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:01,703
But here, you know...
That's the one drawback
of living in London.

1709
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:04,908
Granted, the theater's better,
there's many good
Indian restaurants.

1710
01:32:04,984 --> 01:32:06,179
Well, what did you do?

1711
01:32:06,286 --> 01:32:08,845
What do I do?
I'm Splendini. Magician.

1712
01:32:08,954 --> 01:32:09,944
(EXCLAIMS)

1713
01:32:10,055 --> 01:32:12,024
Would you like
to see something?
Oh, yes, please.

1714
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:13,752
Do we have time
for a card trick?
Yes.

1715
01:32:13,827 --> 01:32:15,521
I believe we have eternity.

1716
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:17,961
I'm going to show you
a little trick now.

1717
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:21,194
I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart,
I mean this sincerely...

1718
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,233
I say this
with all due respect.

1719
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:25,965
You are a wonderful group and
a fantastic group of people.

1720
01:32:26,038 --> 01:32:28,701
I love you and I feel that
coming back from you.

1721
01:32:28,774 --> 01:32:33,109
And you may be deceased,
but you should not
be discouraged.

1722
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:34,510
Because, you know...

1723
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:37,140
Don't think of being dead
as a handicap.

1724
01:32:37,216 --> 01:32:39,344
You know,
when I was a child,
I stuttered.

1725
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,819
But with stick-to-it-iveness
and perseverance,

1726
01:32:41,887 --> 01:32:43,855
you know, you can never tell
what could happen.

1727
01:32:43,923 --> 01:32:45,356
Now, I want you
to take a card, Alma.

1728
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:46,686
Go ahead,
take any card you want.

1729
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,454
Just pick it. Pick it.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

1730
01:32:48,528 --> 01:32:50,256
I love you, sweetheart
That's fantastic
