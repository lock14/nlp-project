1
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Hello.

2
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Say, I was wondering...

3
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,999
What?

4
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Sorry. I was wondering
if you'd like to dance?

5
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Why not?

6
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,200
Kitty, who was the young man you
were dancing with last night?

7
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,099
Which one?

8
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
The quiet, serious-looking one.

9
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh, him.

10
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I suppose you invited him, Mother.

11
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,699
I don't know who you're talking about.

12
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I invited him.

13
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
His name is Fane and he's a doctor.

14
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,900
He manages a
government laboratory in Shanghai.

15
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,799
A civil servant?

16
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,799
In any case.

17
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,700
He called 'round last Sunday,
we had a long chat.

18
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,599
I told him to come back anytime.

19
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,900
It's not often that you
like any of my young men.

20
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,199
Well, do you like him?

21
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,099
Not really.

22
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,400
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he in love with you?

23
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,799
I don't know.

24
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,799
I should have thought by
now you'd know when a

25
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,199
young man was in love with you.

26
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
The point is whether or not
I'm in love with him. And I'm not.

27
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,499
You'd better be careful, young lady.

28
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,399
Time can run out, you know.

29
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh, stop it, Mother. Honestly.

30
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,099
The very idea that a woman should marry

31
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
any Tom, Dick, or Harry...

32
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,500
...regardless of her own feelings
is simply prehistoric.

33
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
How much longer do you expect your
father to go on supporting you?

34
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh.

35
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,300
Hello.
- Hello. I...

36
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I was just coming...

37
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Your father invited me.

38
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,199
I'm going out.

39
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
May I join you?

40
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Right on time.

41
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
What is it exactly that you do?

42
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm a bacteriologist.

43
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
That must be fascinating.

44
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
You have no idea what that is, do you?

45
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,999
No. I'm afraid not.

46
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,699
No, there's no reason you should.

47
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,800
I study the microorganisms
that carry disease.

48
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,899
Charming.

49
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
No, it's not
actually. It's the opposite.

50
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Shall we step inside?

51
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you like flowers?

52
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Not particularly, no.

53
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,799
Well, I mean, yes.

54
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,000
But we don't really have
them around the house.

55
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Mother says, "Why purchase
something you can grow for free?"

56
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
But then we don't really
grow them either.

57
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,799
It does seem silly, really.

58
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,300
To put all that effort into something
that's just going to die.

59
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I'd like to say something to you.

60
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
I came to see you to
ask you if you'll marry me.

61
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You could knock me down with a feather.

62
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Could you not tell
that I'm in love with you?

63
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,199
You never showed it.

64
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, I'd...

65
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,700
Well, I wanted to. It's difficult. I...

66
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,699
But there it is.

67
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,699
Right.

68
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm not sure that's very well put.

69
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,799
No, it's not.

70
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Do you see how clumsy I am? I...

71
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,099
I'm terrible at these sorts of things.

72
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,999
But the thing is

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I've got to get back to China very soon.

74
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I don't have time to be cautious.

75
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,699
I've never thought of you in that way.

76
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,399
I think I improve greatly
upon acquaintance.

77
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,499
Oh, I'm sure you do...

78
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I'd do anything in my power
to make you happy.

79
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Anything at all.

80
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I think you'd like Shanghai.

81
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
It's quite exciting, it is.

82
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,599
Lots of dancing.

83
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Surely you're not
expecting me to answer this second?

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I don't know you at all.

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes! Well, we had the
highest of hopes, but...

86
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,000
...I had no expectation
that he'd ask her so soon.

87
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
Yes. A lovely late autumn wedding.

88
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,700
She's done very well for
her herself, has my Doris.

89
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
At least one of them's made a success.

90
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,200
No, I gave up on Kitty ages ago.

91
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,199
Yes.

92
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,499
Yes.

93
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, I know you understand. Yes.

94
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Well?

95
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Is it smaller than you imagined?

96
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I'm not sure what I imagined.

97
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Don't you have a piano?

98
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
No, I don't play the piano.

99
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,299
Who is it?

100
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
It's I.

101
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Come in.

102
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Just wanted to see

103
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
So, then, you're comfortable, then?

104
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Do you need anything?

105
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,499
No.

106
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,599
I'm fine.

107
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,499
Thank you.

108
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Good. Good.

109
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm so happy you're here.

110
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,199
Shall I shut the lamp?

111
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
What for?

112
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll shut the lamp.

113
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
It's raining cats and dogs.

114
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,300
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.

115
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Yes, I heard you.

116
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,699
You might have answered.

117
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm sorry.

118
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,199
I've gotten used to not speaking...

119
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,999
...unless I have something to say.

120
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,700
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...

121
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,700
...the human race would soon
lose the power of speech.

122
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Walter.

123
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm sorry.

124
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
You're right.

125
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
What shall we do? Shall we...

126
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,199
...shall we play a game?

127
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
You don't like the
games I play. They bore you.

128
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Nonsense.

129
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Let's play cards.

130
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?

131
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,300
We have an
invitation for Saturday night.

132
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,599
From whom?

133
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
The Townsends.

134
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,299
Dorothy Townsend.

135
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Do you not like her?

136
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,099
Well, I've only met her once,

137
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,999
but there's no reason
for her to put on such airs.

138
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Does she? Yes. I have no idea why.

139
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,500
She was what? Married to a vice consul?

140
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,600
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.

141
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,800
Mother wouldn't dream of asking
half of them to dinner.

142
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm taking that black five.

143
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Well, it's all right.

144
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I thought you might enjoy it,

145
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
but we certainly don't have to go.

146
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I don't care either way.

147
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Go where?

148
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,799
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.

149
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,499
I'm so glad you could come.

150
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,599
This is Walter.

151
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,099
I'm pleased to meet you.

152
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,399
This is my husband.

153
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Charlie, stop
talking and greet our guests.

154
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,999
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.

155
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,899
It's Dr. Fane, darling.

156
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,100
Oh, dear. I do beg your
pardon, Dr. Fane.

157
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,399
Not at all.

158
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.

159
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,699
Mrs. Fane.

160
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,699
Mr. Townsend.

161
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,499
I do apologize, Dr. Fane.

162
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,199
I assumed you worked
with Charlie at the consulate.

163
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,599
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.

164
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.

165
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,000
The government lab? How fascinating.

166
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,399
Are you enjoying it?

167
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I've never seen anything like it.

168
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Every gesture has a meaning.

169
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
See how she covers
her face with the cloth?

170
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
She is mourning her misfortune.

171
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
What happened to her?

172
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,700
She was sold into slavery.

173
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,800
Condemned to a life
of drudgery and despair...

174
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
...in a strange land far from home.

175
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
See the chains?

176
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,900
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...

177
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
...from which there is no escape.

178
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
And so she weeps.

179
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,599
She weeps for the lively,

180
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
vivacious girl she once was...

181
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
...for the lonely woman she has become.

182
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
And most of all...

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,300
...she weeps for the love
she'll never feel...

184
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,600
...for the love she'll never give.

185
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Is that really what she's saying?

186
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,900
Actually, I haven't a clue
what she's on about.

187
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I don't speak Chinese.

188
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
What was that?

189
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Perhaps it was the
amah, or one of the...

190
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
They've gone.

191
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,999
He heard us.

192
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,199
Who?

193
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Walter.

194
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Walter. What if it was?

195
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,599
For all he knows you were taking a nap.

196
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,799
With my doors locked?

197
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,500
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.

198
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,300
Even if it was, my
impression is he'll do nothing.

199
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,799
That's flattering.

200
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,799
He knows as well as anyone...

201
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
...there's nothing to be
gained by making a scandal.

202
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Has it occurred to you that my
husband is in love with me?

203
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,700
I have a feeling you're about
to say something awful.

204
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,300
It's just that women are
often under the impression that...

205
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
...men are much more in love
with them than they really are.

206
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,300
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.

207
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Now there you're wrong.

208
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you like your present?

209
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
It's good enough.

210
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Charlie?

211
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,100
Do I make you as happy as you make me?

212
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Of course you do, darling.

213
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,200
"Miss you Father"

214
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
- Hassan?
- Yes?

215
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,500
- Who brought this package 'round?
- Dr. Fane.

216
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,199
When?

217
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
While you sleeping.

218
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
It's nearly midday.

219
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
We could stop up here under the trees...

220
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
...but I'd like to press
on if it's all right with you.

221
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Certainly, my
comfort's of no concern to you.

222
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Right. Then we'll continue.

223
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Charlie Townsend, please.

224
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,599
Charles Townsend.

225
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,299
I need to see you.

226
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,599
Kitty, I can't possibly see you.

227
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
I've got a meeting
in an hour at the club.

228
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,799
What is it?

229
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I have to go.

230
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,099
What are you doing home?

231
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,500
I'm sorry. There's something I
need to speak with you about.

232
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Actually, I was just
about to take my bath.

233
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm afraid it's rather important,
darling. Can't wait.

234
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Sit down.

235
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Do you know a
place called Mei-Tan-Fu?

236
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,599
No.

237
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,200
Well, it was in the
papers the other day.

238
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
It's a small town on a tributary
of the Yangtze River,

239
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
in the interior.

240
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
They've had an
outbreak of cholera there.

241
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,100
It's the worst epidemic anyone's
seen in a long time.

242
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
The Chinese medical officer has died.

243
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,200
There's a convent of French nuns and
they're trying to run the hospital...

244
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,600
...and they're doing the best that they
can, but people are dropping like flies.

245
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,900
I have volunteered to
go and to take charge.

246
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,199
Why?

247
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,599
Because they need a doctor.

248
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
But you're not a doctor.
You're a bacteriologist.

249
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,399
I'm an M.D.

250
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,099
The fact that I'm foremost
a scientist...

251
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
...is actually all
to the good in this case.

252
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Won't it be awfully dangerous?

253
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,600
I suppose it might, yes.

254
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Now, Mei-Tan-Fu
is a ten-day journey.

255
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,100
You can go by rail for the first
part of it, but after that it's carriage...

256
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
...and then we'll
have to take a sedan chair.

257
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,199
Who's we?

258
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,599
Why, you and I, of course.

259
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
You're not expecting me to come too?

260
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,800
I hoped that if I was going
you would want to go.

261
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Surely it's no place for a woman.

262
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
It would be madness
for me to go. Why should I?

263
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,499
To cheer and comfort me?

264
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,399
No.

265
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,799
No, I won't go.

266
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,799
In fact, it's
monstrous of you to even ask me.

267
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Fine. Then I shall file my petition
for divorce tomorrow.

268
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm afraid that you have
thought me a bigger fool than I am.

269
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,799
I don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,799
Don't you?

271
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
I am divorcing you for adultery.

272
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I am naming Charles Townsend
as your lover.

273
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,899
I'm sorry, Walter.

274
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,100
I realize this is very unpleasant, but,

275
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
please, let's not make
this uglier than it needs to be.

276
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,100
By all means. What is it that
you propose that we should do?

277
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,100
You could let me divorce you quietly.

278
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You divorce me?

279
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,200
- On what grounds, may I ask?
- That's what a gentleman would do.

280
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,700
Can you give me one reason I should put myself
to the smallest inconvenience on your account?

281
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Please, Walter, don't be so hateful.

282
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,100
We didn't mean to hurt anyone. But...

283
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
...Charlie and I have fallen in love.

284
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,799
He wants to marry me.

285
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,199
Really?

286
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I knew that you weren't the
cleverest girl in the world...

287
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,598
...but I didn't know
that you were actually a fool.

288
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes. Well, if it makes you
feel better to hurt me,

289
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,199
then go ahead.

290
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,199
But you might as well get used to it.

291
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,699
We love each other.

292
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,199
And we're sick to death
of the secrecy...

293
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,699
...and compromise
and all the rest of it.

294
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,599
And now you curse the day
that you ever met me.

295
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,099
Stop mocking me.

296
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,999
There's no other response...

297
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
...for such pathetic behavior!

298
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,099
It's comic.

299
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
When I think about how hard
I've tried to make you happy.

300
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,100
Debasing myself! Acting as though
I was as thrilled as you...

301
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,599
...by the latest gossip
and as vulgar and as ignorant...

302
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
...of the world as you are!
- Shut up!

303
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,700
If you interrupt me again,
I'll strangle you.

304
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Sit down.

305
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,500
I knew when I married you that

306
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
you were selfish and spoiled.

307
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
But I loved you.

308
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,799
I knew that you married me...

309
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,100
...only to get as far away from
your mother as possible...

310
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
...and I hoped that one day...

311
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
...there'd be something more.

312
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I was wrong.

313
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
You don't have it in you.

314
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,300
If a man hasn't what's necessary
to make a woman love him,

315
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,999
then it's his fault...

316
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,899
...not hers.

317
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Either way.

318
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Tomorrow morning we are
to leave for Mei-Tan-Fu,

319
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,999
or I shall file my petition.

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,799
Walter, you can't be serious
about taking me...

321
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
...into the middle
of a cholera epidemic.

322
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Do you think that I'm not?

323
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
My God.

324
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
That's what you want, isn't it?

325
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,800
Do you really think Charlie
will let you do this?

326
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't think Charlie has
very much to say about it.

327
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Everything you said is true.

328
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Everything.

329
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
I married you even though
I didn't love you.

330
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
But you knew that.

331
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,100
Aren't you as much to
blame for what's happened as I?

332
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
All right.

333
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Here's what I'll do.

334
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,600
Gentlemen, we all have
assets to protect here.

335
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagata's actions...

336
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,799
...have created a rather
urgent situation.

337
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,599
It was an unfortunate,

338
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,700
but unavoidable incident.

339
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,399
Your foreman shot a worker.

340
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,599
He was an agitator.

341
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
He was a Chinese.

342
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
You may have
suppressed a very small strike...

343
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
...but in doing so you have started...

344
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
...a very large demonstration.

345
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,799
I need to use your pen, please.

346
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Here you are, miss.

347
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,199
What about support from
Chiang Kai-shek?

348
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,199
Where does he stand on this?

349
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,400
He's a Nationalist. He will stand
on the side of the Chinese.

350
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
That's why they call themselves
Nationalists.

351
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Excuse me.

352
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Mr. Townsend.

353
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,700
I think you
underestimated the situation.

354
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,700
I have three of my mills
shut down because of walk-outs.

355
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,599
There is talk about boycotts.

356
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,799
So, what do you propose?

357
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,500
A handful of municipal
soldiers is hardly a show of force.

358
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
If you'll excuse me.

359
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Mrs. Fane. What a pleasant surprise.

360
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
You've rescued me from
a pack of wild bores.

361
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
I wouldn't have come if
it wasn't necessary.

362
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Are you all right?

363
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,500
I needed to see you. I'm sorry.

364
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,800
Kitty, this is not the
most opportune time for me to...

365
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,400
He knows.

366
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Right.

367
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
After you, Mrs. Fane.

368
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Hello, Charlie. Hello, George.

369
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,199
Hello, Townsend.

370
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Adam.

371
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
He wants a divorce.

372
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You didn't commit yourself, did you?

373
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,899
Acknowledge anything?

374
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,099
No.

375
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,399
Are you sure?

376
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Quite sure.

377
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Well.

378
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
This is a bloody scrape we're in.

379
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,699
He says he has proof.

380
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,599
We deny it.

381
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,799
He can't prove anything.

382
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,700
Besides, it wouldn't do Walter
any good to create a scandal.

383
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
But there isn't going to be a scandal.

384
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,100
Walter's agreed to let
me divorce him quietly.

385
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,300
That's not so terrible, is it?

386
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,399
Will you hold me?

387
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Of course I will.

388
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Oh, God.

389
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Charlie?

390
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
His offer comes with a condition.

391
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,099
I'm not a rich man.

392
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
He doesn't want your money.

393
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,599
He's agreed to let me divorce him...

394
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,100
...if Dorothy will agree to divorce you.

395
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
And if...

396
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
What?

397
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,100
If you'll promise to marry me.

398
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,200
You know, darling, whatever happens,

399
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,300
we must try to keep Dorothy out of it.

400
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
What do you mean?

401
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
We can't only think of ourselves.

402
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,299
I know Dorothy.

403
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,500
Nothing in the world
will induce her to divorce me.

404
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,199
You don't want to divorce her.

405
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
It's not just a
question of my marriage...

406
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,199
Then what is it?

407
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,300
Do you have any idea of the importance
of my station here?

408
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
If I were...

409
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Why are you laughing?

410
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't think Walter
intended for one minute to divorce me.

411
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
He knew you'd let me down.

412
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,199
Try to understand.

413
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,699
I understand, all right.

414
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,699
Kitty! Kitty, please.

415
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
We'll work this out, I promise. D...

416
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,299
I'm coming with you.

417
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Good. I thought you might.

418
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,700
I suppose I needn't take more
than a few summer things?

419
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,299
And a shroud?

420
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,399
I've told Hassan what you will need.

421
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
She's packing already.

422
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

423
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
They may have died in that bed.

424
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
This can be your room.

425
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
You must be the doctor's wife.

426
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,099
I've just met your husband...

427
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
...and invited myself to dinner.

428
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,299
I've kept the Watsons' cook for you.

429
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,299
She's not bad.

430
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
She'll have to do as your amah as well.

431
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
We're a little short-handed here.

432
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Sorry, my name is Waddington.

433
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
Oh, yes, of course. Kitty Fane.

434
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,699
I'm the Deputy Commissioner.

435
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,699
Please.

436
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,500
I believe you're one of our neighbors.

437
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,799
Only neighbor, I'm afraid.

438
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Last one standing.

439
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
And Watson was the missionary
living here?

440
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,499
Yes. Nice fellow.

441
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
American. Lovely family.

442
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
I'll show you their
graves tomorrow, if you like.

443
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,799
How kind of you.

444
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I hope your journey wasn't too arduous?

445
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,700
We've been traveling for two weeks.

446
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,700
Two weeks? What did you do, swim?

447
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
No, we didn't come
up river. Came overland.

448
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,599
Whatever for?

449
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,700
Well, we wanted to take
in a bit of the countryside.

450
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Get a bit of sun. Didn't we, darling?

451
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Anyone for a cocktail?

452
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Here's luck.

453
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,100
I was told I might get some help
from the local army officer.

454
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Colonel Yu, is it?

455
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,000
Good luck with him.
He's not fond of us British.

456
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Listen, I'll warn you,

457
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
things are pretty dicey even out here.

458
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,599
I'm afraid that if the
cholera doesn't get us,

459
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
the Nationalists might.

460
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,299
Tried to get those nuns to go,

461
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,999
but they refused.

462
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,100
They all want to be martyrs, damn them.

463
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
And why have you stayed?

464
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,500
I was posted here. Simple as that.

465
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,300
I was shocked to hear you'd volunteered.

466
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Opportunity for research.
I couldn't pass it up.

467
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Yes. And you?

468
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,900
I don't suppose you've come to
Mei-Tan-Fu for the research.

469
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
My husband's the scientist.

470
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,999
Indeed.

471
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Did you have any
reaction to the inoculation?

472
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,799
You have been inoculated?

473
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Yes, of course.

474
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,900
No guarantee. The Watsons were
inoculated, it didn't do them much good.

475
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Have you brought any gramophone records?

476
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
No, unfortunately not.

477
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,400
Pity. I'm sick of all mine.

478
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,399
Listen.

479
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
What's all that?

480
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,399
Across the river.

481
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,700
Trying to frighten
off the spirit of death.

482
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm going to town in the morning.
Have a look around.

483
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,199
I expect you'll want to rest.

484
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I can inoculate you in the evening.

485
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,499
Will you be doing yourself?

486
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
No, I don't think so.

487
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,999
You needn't bother with me then.

488
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Suit yourself.

489
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Tell me, Walter.

490
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,199
Is it a long, drawn-out affair,

491
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,299
dying of cholera?

492
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,599
No. All of the fluid goes out of you...

493
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,399
...in the first 36 hours.

494
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
You die of dehydration, actually.

495
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
So, it's messy and very painful.

496
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
But it is relatively quick.

497
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Good night.

498
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
It's rather unfortunate.

499
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,699
I thought perhaps
that you and your wife...

500
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,300
...you'd like to take precautions
in case you have to leave this place.

501
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,399
Do you think all
this is really necessary?

502
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,199
You can see the picture.

503
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,100
I thought you'd like
to put your wife's mind...

504
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,500
...at rest from this situation.

505
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,100
This is Colonel Yu. He's the KMT's man.

506
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
He's posting one of
his men here at the house.

507
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,199
Am I a prisoner?

508
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,400
No. It was Mr. Waddington's
idea actually.

509
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,199
He feels we should take precautions.

510
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Precautions against what?

511
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,800
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...

512
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,200
...on a group of Chinese workers
who were demonstrating in Shanghai.

513
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Eleven were killed.

514
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,199
We've only just heard.

515
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Those were plastered around
the town last night.

516
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,299
I shouldn't worry too much.

517
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Even the Nationalists
are afraid of cholera.

518
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Do they take that water from the well?

519
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Colonel, can I see where they
get their drinking water?

520
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,699
For starters, we've
got to stop people from...

521
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
...using this well until I can test it.

522
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,899
Do you understand?

523
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.

524
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,000
I received my
military training in Moscow.

525
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,199
If you don't like English,

526
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
we can speak Russian.

527
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
English will be fine. Thank you.

528
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,399
Here.

529
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
You have seen
cholera before, yes, Doctor?

530
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,799
At the laboratory, of course.

531
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,499
No, I mean in a patient.

532
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
No. No, I haven't had the chance

533
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,799
Well, I'm not a clinician.

534
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,199
Did they not tell you?

535
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm an infectious disease specialist.

536
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,400
Shall we? After you, Doctor.

537
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Charlie

538
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,300
without you it is intolerable

539
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I don't need you.

540
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,300
Go back!

541
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Mr. Waddington?

542
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.

543
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,500
Wait here. All right?

544
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,099
Hello?

545
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Mr. Waddington?

546
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Mrs. Fane?

547
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,300
Good morning.

548
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,799
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?

549
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I found a record for you.

550
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,199
Stravinsky.

551
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Very modern. Thank you.

552
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Was there something else?

553
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,999
I was wondering if you could tell me...

554
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,299
...when the post comes through.

555
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,699
It's for Shanghai.

556
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,299
Unfortunately, since the cholera,

557
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
the cowards won't venture
past the river port...

558
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
...but leave it with me.

559
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,000
A local trader I know is
making the trip on Friday.

560
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
Townsend.

561
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,899
Charlie Townsend?

562
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,100
Yes. He's an acquaintance of my husband.

563
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,999
Do you know him?

564
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,100
Years ago. We were both assigned
to the consulate in Shanghai.

565
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,599
Charming wife?

566
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,599
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?

567
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
He'd made a science of popularity.

568
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,799
So, you know his family?

569
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,000
Well, well enough. I like Dorothy.

570
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,700
Yes, I understand
they're quite the devoted couple.

571
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
Oh, he had his little flirtations.

572
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Nothing serious.

573
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,500
I once heard her say that
she found it most unflattering...

574
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,199
...that the women
who fell for her husband...

575
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,400
...were so consistently second-rate.

576
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,700
Well, enjoy the record.

577
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Mrs. Fane?

578
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
The letter.

579
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,799
Right.

580
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,400
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me
that Friday's much too late.

581
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Thanks all the same.

582
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Can you pass the salt, please?

583
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

584
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Could you pass the salt?

585
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Thank you.

586
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
So, this is how it's going to be?

587
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,700
Passing her evenings in silence.

588
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,300
Walter.

589
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,100
Walter!

590
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,700
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.

591
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.

592
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Leave it.

593
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Thank you.

594
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Are you looking to kill yourself?

595
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Town well's contaminated.

596
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,700
This is dirty. It's dirty.

597
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
What?

598
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Mr. Waddington?

599
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,700
Mrs. Fane?

600
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Mrs. Fane!

601
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,700
Come away. Come away.

602
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
What's the matter with Te-Ming?

603
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,700
You have the dead man on you.

604
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,799
They're very superstitious, aren't they?

605
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,700
She's lost three children and
a husband to the cholera.

606
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
So, you can hardly blame her.

607
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,699
You know,

608
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
this is no place for a woman.

609
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,599
When they telegraphed me that you were

610
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,500
coming out, I was astonished.

611
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,200
I imagined you might be
a grim-visaged old nurse...

612
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,400
...with thick legs and a mustache.

613
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
I came into the bungalow
and there you were...

614
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,100
...frail and tired...

615
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,200
...and very unhappy.

616
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,899
It was a long journey.

617
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
But you're unhappy now.

618
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,499
And it occurred to me that you and your

619
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
husband might be madly in love...

620
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
...and that you'd
simply refused to stay behind.

621
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
That's a reasonable explanation.

622
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Yes. But it's not the right one.

623
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Do you know what I find strange?

624
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
That your husband should
never look at you.

625
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,400
He looks at the
walls, the floor, his shoes.

626
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
He has a great deal on his mind.

627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yes, I'm sure of it.

628
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,899
Dr. Fane!

629
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
Dr. Fane!

630
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, God.

631
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
All right.

632
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,300
What are you doing?

633
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Martini?

634
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Yes?

635
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm the bearer of a
message from the Mother Superior.

636
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,199
Who?

637
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,300
The nun who supervises the
orphanage and the hospital.

638
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
I didn't know she was
aware of my existence.

639
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,900
Well, apparently Mr. Waddington
has spoken of you.

640
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,600
She would very much
like to meet the loving...

641
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,300
...loyal wife of the
compassionate Dr. Fane.

642
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,500
Right. Then I must
prepare myself for the charade.

643
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,300
She does understand if you...

644
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
...don't want to venture
into the center of the epidemic.

645
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,100
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

646
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
I forgot.

647
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,799
Walter!

648
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Oh, my God!

649
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Oh, you're drunk.

650
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,299
Don't expect anything grand.

651
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
They're miserably poor.

652
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,699
Hello.

653
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,000
It's a great pleasure to
make the acquaintance

654
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,700
of the wife of our good
and brave doctor.

655
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,799
Lovely to meet you, too.

656
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Mr. Waddington.

657
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
You must eat the madeleines.

658
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,600
Sister St. Joseph made them
for you herself this morning.

659
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
So, tell me, Mrs. Fane.

660
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
To which faith do you subscribe?

661
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Excuse me.

662
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,100
We attended services,

663
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,100
not religiously regularly.

664
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,800
You could say I'm a
member of the Church of England.

665
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,399
Which is an
inoffensive way of saying you

666
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,400
don't quite believe in anything much.

667
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,100
You're very pretty.

668
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,199
And very young.

669
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,100
I assure you I'm not. I feel ancient.

670
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,100
If Mrs. Fane would like
to see over the convent...

671
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,700
...and orphanage. I shall
be glad to show her.

672
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Alone.

673
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,900
We keep the older girls
busy with sewing.

674
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It keeps them occupied.

675
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,600
And earns money for the convent.

676
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,700
That one won't allow us to baptize her.

677
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Our music room.

678
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,600
Sister Maryse.

679
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,700
Sister Dominique was our pianist.

680
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,300
She died last week. Cholera.

681
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,500
Through there is the infirmary.

682
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,900
It is not a sight one would wish to see.

683
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,100
Shall I call Dr. Fane out to see you?

684
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,700
No. You needn't disturb him.

685
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,100
Now, with the epidemic...

686
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,000
...we have even more to care for.

687
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,100
This baby was brought in this morning.

688
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Another orphan.

689
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,800
She says Dr. Fane loves babies.

690
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,400
He spends as much time as
he can in the nursery.

691
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,600
Mrs. Fane?

692
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,700
Mrs. Fane?

693
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,699
You all right?

694
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,700
Yes.

695
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,100
It's nothing...

696
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
...only foolishness.

697
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,800
What do you want?

698
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,600
Sorry.

699
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,999
I brought you your supper.

700
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
All right. Just leave it there.

701
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,599
Is there something else?

702
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
What's that you're doing?

703
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,300
I am testing the nitrate
levels of a local tomato.

704
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,100
Why?

705
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Why?

706
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,900
Can't possibly interest you.

707
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,400
Well, enjoy your supper.

708
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,100
Walter.

709
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,300
What do you propose we should
do if we get through the epidemic?

710
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,799
I have no ideas.

711
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,799
But I don't think any good will come...

712
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,399
...of always talking about
a situation that we

713
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,599
should do much better to forget.

714
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,199
But you don't forget.

715
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,699
Please. I really must work.

716
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,699
Won't you listen to what I have to say?

717
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,700
All right. If you insist.

718
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,100
It's, it's just today, having...

719
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,900
...been at the convent with those nuns.

720
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,499
What have they done, converted you?

721
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
No.

722
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,700
They spoke of you.
And it made me feel...

723
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,799
What?

724
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,700
- It made you feel what?
- I think I've been afraid of you.

725
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Well, you should have been.

726
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,799
Excuse me.

727
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
If, if I can't work, I'm going to bed.

728
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,500
I know you're angry at me. But if we

729
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,600
could just try and talk about...

730
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,199
Honestly, I don't understand you.

731
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,200
What is it that you want from me?

732
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,199
Perhaps I just want us to be a little

733
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,199
less unhappy.

734
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,999
You're mistaken in thinking
that I'm unhappy.

735
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,199
I have far too much to
do here to think of

736
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,199
you very much at all.

737
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,400
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

738
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,899
I feel useless.

739
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,200
What do you propose that I do about
that? For God's sakes, Walter!

740
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,200
Will you stop punishing me?

741
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,100
Do you absolutely despise me?

742
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,099
No. I despise myself.

743
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,799
Why?

744
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
For allowing myself to love you once.

745
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Hello.

746
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,200
I hope I haven't come at
an inconvenient time.

747
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,600
Sister Maryse died last night.

748
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I've just written to inform her parents.

749
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
I'm so sorry.

750
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,400
But it is sinful of me to grieve...

751
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,800
...when I know that her good and simple
soul has flown straight to heaven.

752
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,200
How can I help you?

753
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,400
Well, I'm sure that
with the sister's death...

754
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
...you must be even more shorthanded.

755
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,700
You see, I was wondering if
I could come to the convent...

756
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,400
...and do anything just,
just to help out.

757
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,300
My dear child, don't you
think you've done enough...

758
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,999
...coming here with your husband?

759
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I've been here a month.

760
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,000
Believe me, I have nothing to
do from morning till night.

761
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,600
Perhaps I could help with the
sisters in the hospital.

762
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,500
That is impossible.
Cholera is a terrible thing to see.

763
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,600
Besides, what would
happen if you should fall ill?

764
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,700
I'd be happy to
scrub the floors, anything...

765
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,400
...just something to feel useful.

766
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
That will not be necessary.

767
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
The orphans scrub the floors.

768
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:23,500
No, no, it is our business and
our privilege to do such things.

769
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,300
But there is always more to do each day.

770
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,600
Have you spoken to
your husband of your wish?

771
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
Yes.

772
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I don't know what you're saying.

773
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,099
I also found traces in the river,

774
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,099
downstream from the burial grounds.

775
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,499
You've checked these results?

776
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
I tested it three times.

777
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Well, that's it then.

778
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,100
I would recommend barricading
the bathing area...

779
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,599
...cut off all access to the river.

780
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,100
How far do you expect people
to walk for their water?

781
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,999
I've no idea.

782
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,800
Up river, at least a
half-mile above the burial ground.

783
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,599
That's too far.

784
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,099
Nevertheless.

785
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,100
I agree with Dr. Fane.

786
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
It's necessary.

787
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Also, I thought we'd
agreed to post a directive...

788
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,799
...ordering people to dispose
of the corpses immediately.

789
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,399
We have done that already, Doctor.

790
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,400
Yes, but if you don't
enforce it then it doesn't matter.

791
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,700
Because the families are hiding
the bodies for days.

792
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,199
Then they bury them too
close to the river.

793
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,900
I understand the problem. You
don't have to explain it twice.

794
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,700
Colonel, I respectfully request that...

795
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,199
you order your soldiers...

796
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,400
...to enter these people's homes...

797
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:56,401
...and remove the
bodies by force if necessary.

798
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
It's all right.

799
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Hello.

800
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,199
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

801
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,000
The spirits need access to the
water. I understand that.

802
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,300
I just want to move a few of these
so that they don't live in the water.

803
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,600
He said that they're under
the protection of their warlord.

804
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,400
If he wants to move the bodies,
he will send his own soldiers.

805
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,599
These really aren't the
best times for a Western woman...

806
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,600
...to go exploring a
Chinese town by herself.

807
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
Oh, do be quiet.

808
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
As if you care whether I'm killed
by Nationalists or boredom.

809
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,800
Besides, I wasn't alone.

810
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,600
I was with my
gallant protector Sung Ching.

811
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,899
By the way...

812
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,299
...you might be happy to know that...

813
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,000
...I am just as useless
to the nuns as I am to you.

814
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,000
I shut off the town's only
water supply today.

815
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,800
What will you do?

816
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I have no idea.

817
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Then I suppose we're both useless.

818
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,400
At last, something in common.

819
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,300
Dr. Fane. We've both been
caught out in the weather.

820
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:41,300
Not now, sorry.

821
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,099
I beg your pardon?

822
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,199
Counting.

823
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,200
Counting?

824
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
We'll camp here tonight.

825
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,700
What makes you think this
warlord fellow will cooperate?

826
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,699
I don't think he will.

827
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,700
So, what do you plan to
say to persuade him?

828
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,200
I don't know.

829
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,200
These men are like animals.

830
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,499
They have no vision.

831
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
They only have hunger and strength.

832
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,600
Men like this have held the real
power in China since I was young.

833
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,500
But that time is coming to an end.

834
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,100
There's no place for
them in the new China.

835
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,900
I don't think you like my
being here very much either, do you?

836
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,200
I think China
belongs to Chinese people...

837
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,600
...but the rest of
the world seems to disagree.

838
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
Yes, but that's got nothing
to do with me.

839
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,799
I didn't come here with a gun, you know.

840
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
I came here with a microscope.

841
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,900
I believe you.

842
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,700
But it would be nice
to do this work together...

843
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,900
...without your country's
guns pointing at our people.

844
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,800
Our plan is to divert the water to
the town from the fields upriver...

845
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,900
...above the burial grounds.

846
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,800
With your permission and
the assistance of your troops...

847
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,200
...the graves will be moved
away from the water.

848
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,599
And Colonel Yu and his men...

849
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,800
...will enforce the
prompt burial of the dead...

850
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,699
...maintaining the
integrity of the water sources...

851
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,700
...and enforcing proper sanitation
over the next few weeks.

852
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,800
It will make a difference between a few
more deaths and possibly thousands.

853
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,100
He says, if we keep the
water source clean,

854
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,599
and enforce proper
sanitation procedures,

855
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,499
then in a few weeks,

856
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,799
the death toll...

857
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,400
...could reduce more than one thousand.

858
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,800
He said no.

859
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
He doesn't speak any English, does he?

860
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,700
Tell him that's the most ridiculous
suit that I've ever seen.

861
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,399
I'm sorry.

862
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,099
Do not stop on my account...

863
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,200
...if Dr. Fane is enjoying himself.

864
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,400
No, no, not at all.

865
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,599
It's very nice. I was passing...

866
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,899
No. Stay.

867
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,799
I should go.

868
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
I insist.

869
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,799
All right, if you like.

870
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,799
Continue, Mrs. Fane.

871
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,100
But perhaps something
a little more soothing.

872
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Yes, of course.

873
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,300
They brought in a new baby today.

874
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,700
The girls named her Zan Xien.

875
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,100
It means "brand new."

876
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,900
The nuns are going
to call it Katherine...

877
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,300
...which, of course, none
of the girls will be able to say.

878
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Thank goodness for those nuns.

879
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,000
They do so much for so little in return.

880
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,800
I suppose you can look at it that way.

881
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,100
You suppose?

882
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,700
I think it might be a bit
more complicated than that.

883
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,700
They take in desperate
children and give them a chance at life.

884
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
What could be so complicated about that?

885
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,800
They also go to young
mothers in their homes.

886
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,700
They ask them to give their
babies to the convent.

887
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,599
They offer them money
to support their families...

888
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
...to persuade them to do it.

889
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,900
They're not just here to run
an orphanage, your nuns.

890
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
They're turning those children
into little Catholics.

891
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,100
None of us are in China
without a reason.

892
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,999
Still, on the whole...

893
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,199
...I think that what they're doing...

894
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,100
...is a pretty good deed, don't you?

895
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,599
I'm here to study bacteria.

896
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,700
I don't feel the need to have an
opinion about the rest of it.

897
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,800
Well, I do, and I admire them.

898
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,500
I don't think it has to
be so complicated and gloomy.

899
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:09,000
And I think what you're doing,
for instance, is incredibly noble.

900
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,900
You used to feel
contempt for me. Don't you still?

901
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,300
Walter. I can't believe that
you with all your cleverness...

902
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,700
...should have such little
sense of proportion.

903
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,900
We humans are more complex
than your silly little microbes.

904
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,100
We're unpredictable. We make
mistakes and we disappoint.

905
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,899
Yes, we certainly do.

906
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,299
I'm sorry.

907
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,400
I'm sorry I'm not the perfect young
woman that you want me to be.

908
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,900
I'm just ordinary.

909
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,400
I never tried to pretend
that I was anything else.

910
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
No, you certainly didn't.

911
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,499
I like the theater...

912
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
...and dancing and...

913
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:02,300
...playing tennis. I like games.
I like men who play games.

914
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,700
God forgive me, that's the
way I was brought up.

915
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
Well, I play a pretty
fierce hand of bridge.

916
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,400
Oh, well, that's bloody exciting.

917
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,500
And you, you dragged me around all
those interminable galleries in Venice...

918
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,300
...blathering on about
the miracle of the canals...

919
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,700
...and the flashing
of the lagoon system...

920
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,099
...or some such nonsense.

921
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,700
Honestly, I'd have been much happier
playing golf at Sandwich.

922
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,300
I suppose you're right.

923
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,500
It was silly of us to look for qualities
in each other that we never had.

924
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,900
Yes.

925
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,100
Yes, it was.

926
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Walter?

927
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,399
Why didn't you break down that door...

928
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,400
...when you knew I
was in there with Charlie?

929
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,100
You might have at
least tried to thrash him.

930
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,300
He wasn't worth it.

931
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
Or maybe I'm just too proud to fight.

932
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,600
I don't know about that.

933
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,500
I've told Mother Superior to
keep her sisters inside the convent.

934
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,100
I put a guard outside the gate.

935
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,500
I'd advise any Westerners
to stay indoors.

936
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,600
All right.

937
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,600
Sister, has Mrs. Fane been
at the convent today?

938
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,600
Yes. But she, she has
left a few minutes ago.

939
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
Sung Ching.

940
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,399
Let's go!

941
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,400
Let's go!

942
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Let's go!

943
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,900
Sung Ching. Where's Mrs.
Fane? Where's Mrs. Fane?!

944
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,700
I don't know what you're saying!

945
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,799
Get away from her.

946
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,800
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

947
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
Come on.

948
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
We're out of whiskey.

949
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
Dr. Fane.

950
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Could I trouble you for a drink?

951
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,400
Hello, darling.

952
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,100
I was stationed at Hankow
during the revolution...

953
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,300
...when they were massacring
all the Manchus.

954
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,400
I was able to help a particular family.

955
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,700
New documents, that sort of thing.

956
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,500
She was the youngest of the daughters.

957
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,400
I didn't pay her too much
attention at first.

958
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,500
Well, more than I should
have, I suppose.

959
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,900
When I left Hankow, she followed me.

960
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,800
I sent her back two,
three times. But she...

961
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,700
...she kept coming back.

962
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,100
I didn't realize you had
so much affection for her.

963
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,500
What makes you think I do?

964
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,800
I can see it in your eyes.

965
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
Men are incalculable.

966
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,600
I thought you were
just like everybody else...

967
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,500
...now I feel I don't
know the first thing about you.

968
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,600
I wonder what she sees in you.

969
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,900
Wan Xi.

970
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,100
She says I'm a good man.

971
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,700
As if a woman ever
loved a man for his virtue.

972
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,300
Morning.

973
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,200
Morning.

974
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,400
I should think it best to
stay away from town today.

975
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,300
All right.

976
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,600
I'm going for a walk.

977
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,300
Come on, then.

978
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
What on earth are you doing
all the way out here?

979
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,900
Walking off a crippling hangover.

980
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,599
What are you doing?

981
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,500
I've been attempting to purchase
a stalk of bamboo.

982
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,999
But his price is exorbitant.

983
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,499
Or my head is...

984
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
...too shattered to negotiate.

985
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,699
So...

986
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,800
- Would you like a ride home?
- On what?

987
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,200
The buffalo?

988
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,700
You see, we're diverting it from
these fields temporarily...

989
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,199
...sending it straight into the center

990
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,200
of town where they can get it easily.

991
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,400
It's over a half-mile. It gave
us a devil of a time in some places.

992
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,100
But it's worth it.

993
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,100
Oh, Mother.

994
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,299
Am I going to die?

995
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,500
Come, come. You mustn't be so silly.

996
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:07,799
Listen, ma chere...

997
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,800
...is it possible that
you're with child?

998
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,899
- No.
- Oh, yes.

999
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,900
- No.
- Yes.

1000
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,500
I mean...

1001
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,700
I...

1002
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,299
I suppose it's possible.

1003
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,099
There is no doubt about it.

1004
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,400
Yes. Sister St. Joseph knew at once.

1005
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,599
She comes from a large family so she

1006
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:34,600
has experience in these matters.

1007
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,199
I can't believe it.

1008
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,200
Why can't you believe it?

1009
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,700
Having a child is so natural.

1010
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,699
Yes.

1011
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,700
Think how happy your husband will be.

1012
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,599
And what's happened here?

1013
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,599
- I'm all right.
- They said you fainted.

1014
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,799
I'm fine.

1015
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,800
- Let me look at you.
- It's not cholera.

1016
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,200
No. I don't think so.

1017
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Did you feel nauseous? Or just faint?

1018
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,300
Walter, stop.

1019
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,100
I'm pregnant.

1020
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,300
A baby?

1021
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,499
You're quite certain?

1022
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,500
Yes.

1023
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,200
Well, that's wonderful.

1024
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,800
How long do you think
you've been like this?

1025
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,700
Two months.

1026
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,400
Maybe longer.

1027
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,700
Kitty.

1028
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,800
Am I the father?

1029
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:28,100
I honestly don't know.

1030
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,800
I'm sorry.

1031
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,300
Well.

1032
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
It doesn't matter now.

1033
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,400
Does it?

1034
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
No.

1035
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,100
No, it doesn't.

1036
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
Dr. Fane!

1037
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
Come with me.

1038
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:19,899
What is this? Where
are they coming from?

1039
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:22,500
The cholera spread south
along the river.

1040
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,900
They have no
doctors or facilities there.

1041
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,599
If they come in,
they'll contaminate everything.

1042
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,600
We've got to keep them outside the town.

1043
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,700
Dr. Fane!

1044
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,800
Dr. Fane!

1045
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,799
Stop! Stop!

1046
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
Stop!

1047
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,600
Please stop here! We can help you here!

1048
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,699
Colonel, tell them
not to go into the town!

1049
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,700
Tell them we'll help them here!

1050
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:38,500
Mrs. Fane. Gather all the
children in the music room.

1051
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,700
Wait here.

1052
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,100
Let's go!

1053
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,300
That boy. Bring him
here, bring him here.

1054
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,600
He has a cut. I'll treat him.

1055
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,299
I don't understand.

1056
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:42,199
Why didn't he wake me?

1057
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,400
He made an early start.
And you needed the rest.

1058
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,800
How far is the refugee camp?

1059
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:52,300
Just outside the town, in the foothills.

1060
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,400
Dr. Fane told me he wanted you
to leave, but you would not.

1061
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,100
I didn't want to leave you.

1062
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,200
Yes. And we
appreciate it, dear child, but...

1063
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
...I think you did not
want to leave him either.

1064
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:12,600
Well... it's my duty.

1065
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,800
Duty is only washing your
hands when they are dirty.

1066
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,700
I fell in love when I was 17...

1067
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:25,499
...with God.

1068
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,700
A foolish girl with romantic notions...

1069
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,100
...about the life of a religious.

1070
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,300
But my love was passionate.

1071
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,300
Over the years, my feelings
have changed.

1072
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,000
He's disappointed me. Ignored me.

1073
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,400
We've settled into a relationship
of peaceful indifference.

1074
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,400
The old husband and wife who
sit side by side on the sofa,

1075
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,500
but rarely speak.

1076
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,100
He knows I will never leave Him.

1077
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,700
This is my duty.

1078
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,700
But when love and duty are one.

1079
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,200
...then grace is within you.

1080
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,900
Your soldier is
waiting to take you back.

1081
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,199
I'd rather stay.

1082
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,200
No.

1083
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,400
What? What is it?

1084
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,799
What?

1085
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,800
Mrs. Fane?

1086
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:46,300
Mr. Waddington?

1087
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,099
It's your husband.

1088
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,699
What? What is it?

1089
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,700
He's been taken ill.

1090
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,200
Where is he?

1091
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
Mrs. Fane?

1092
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,299
Walter! Oh, no. She can't be here.

1093
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,199
It's not safe. Waddington!

1094
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,200
I'm afraid I've got no say in the matter

1095
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,800
I don't want an audience.

1096
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:49,199
You have to go.

1097
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,399
Your baby.

1098
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,400
Please, you must go.

1099
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,800
Walter, tell me what I should do.

1100
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,100
Slow that drip down.
It's running too fast.

1101
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,399
Good, good.

1102
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,400
Kitty? Kitty.

1103
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:14,400
It's going to get much
worse before it breaks.

1104
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,600
Are you prepared for this?

1105
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,100
Yes.

1106
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,200
What is it?

1107
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,600
Can you send for more?

1108
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
Kitty.

1109
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,600
Kitty.

1110
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,200
Are you awake?

1111
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:18,600
Are you feeling better?

1112
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,900
Forgive me.

1113
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,200
Forgive you?

1114
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,100
There's nothing to forgive.

1115
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,500
Walter.

1116
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,200
I'm sorry.

1117
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I'm so sorry.

1118
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,400
Mrs. Fane?

1119
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,200
Dr. Fane would want
to be buried immediately.

1120
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,400
Yes, of course.

1121
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:39,300
# At the clear fountain,
while I was strolling by #

1122
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:45,700
# I found the water so
nice that I went in to bathe #

1123
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:53,800
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1124
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:59,900
# Under an oak tree, I dried myself #

1125
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:06,400
# On the highest branch, a
nightingale was singing #

1126
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:13,800
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1127
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:20,100
# Sing, nightingale, sing,
your heart is so happy #

1128
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:26,300
# Your heart feels like laughing,
mine feels like weeping #

1129
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,699
What are you doing?

1130
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:34,200
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1131
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:40,800
# I lost my beloved without
deserving it #

1132
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:48,200
# For a bunch of
roses that I denied him #

1133
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:55,500
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1134
01:56:56,700 --> 01:57:02,500
# I wanted the rose
to be still on the bush #

1135
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:10,200
# And my sweet beloved
to be still loving me #

1136
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:17,700
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1137
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:24,100
# At the clear fountain,
while I was strolling by #

1138
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:30,800
# I found the water so
nice that I went in to bathe #

1139
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:38,500
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1140
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:44,300
# Under an oak tree, I dried myself #

1141
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:51,000
# On the highest branch, a
nightingale was singing #

1142
01:57:51,600 --> 01:58:01,700
# So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you #

1143
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,200
It's silly, really.

1144
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,499
They'll die in a week.

1145
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,500
It's hardly worth the cost.

1146
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,099
What do you think?

1147
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,100
I think they're quite nice.

1148
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,500
Really?

1149
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,900
I think you're right.

1150
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,800
Come on.

1151
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,000
We better hurry. Grandfather's waiting.

1152
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,400
Kitty Fane?

1153
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,099
As I live and breathe.

1154
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:48,999
Hello, Charlie.

1155
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
What are you doing in London?

1156
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:55,700
I know it's been a long time.

1157
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,200
I should have written.

1158
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,700
Who's this fine chap? Hello, young man.

1159
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,199
What's your name?

1160
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,499
Walter.

1161
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:10,100
Hello, Walter. I'm Charlie Townsend.

1162
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:12,899
How old are you?

1163
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,499
Five.

1164
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,200
Come on, darling. We should
really press on.

1165
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,600
Yes, of course.

1166
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:22,700
Well, it's lovely seeing you again.

1167
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,299
Goodbye, Walter.

1168
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,300
Goodbye.

1169
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,800
Kitty!

1170
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,300
I'm going to be in London for
the next 3 weeks. Perhaps we could...

1171
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,400
Goodbye, Mr. Townsend.

1172
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Goodbye, Mrs. Fane.

1173
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:48,100
Who was that, Mommy?

1174
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,700
No one important, darling.
