You want me not to help?
Bitch... You want vodka?
Working late, Bernicki.
Hunting Jews...
Our new bosses are very organized.
Hunting can work up a thirst.
Fifteen in one day...
Our new bosses are very organized.
500 roubles for every one we turn in.
A Jew is worth that much?
Do you pay more for a fat one?
500 roubles for every one we turn in.
Caught five in a ditch. Smelled so bad I
thought the Germans wouldn't want them.
Maybe for a reduced price.
You know the Bielskis?
We missed them
when we visited the parents.
The wife doesn't like these long nights.
Keep it.
Bribing an officer of the law?
Hiding more of this black market vodka
in the barn?
Please, take a look.
And clean out the cow shit
while you're there.
Ah!
You'll keep your eyes open, yes?
Good hunting.
You worked late.
Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off?
Fucking SS never sleeps...
You know who I am?
Sit!
You know why I'm here.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
lf they say find someone,
I find him. It's my job.
To kill Jews.
Or lose my job.
And you like your job.
I was always fair with your family.
Everyone knew you were smuggling.
I looked the other way.
Ask your father.
My father? You can ask my father.
On your knees.
On your knees!
Please... I beg you.
Collaborator.
Traitor!
We are the Bielskis!
We'll be back.
My truck! Who did this?
Who are you?
This truck took away Jews.
The Germans made me use it.
It's one of ours,
but there is no one here.
Maybe he was drunk?
Look for him and hurry up!
We want to get to the party!
A-ha!
Asael!
Asael!
Hello Koscik.
In the barn.
JEW LOVER
I'm sorry.
Come.
Go.
Ssh...
Good morning. Early to market?
Could you spare us a little bit of milk?
This is what I must give the Germans.
lf I don't meet my quota,
they'll shoot me and my family.
Comrade, we are grateful
for your cooperation.
What a lovely coat.
Leave now and we won't shoot all of you!
Don't be a fool.
There are hundreds of us!
There are hundreds of us!
Who is the fool?
Let's go!
Who are you?
A brigade of independent fighters.
What brigade?
The Bielski Otriad.
Ah!
We know of you. Jewish bandits.
I'm sure we can clear this up
with your commander.
We know of you. Jewish bandits.
I am Viktor Panchenko,
Commander of the October Otriad.
We've heard of a Jewish gang
stealing from villages loyal to us.
How do you respond to these charges?
When you take food, it is support.
When we do, it is stealing.
We are soldiers of the Red Army.
And we fight a common enemy.
The Motherland doesn't distinguish
between Jews and non-Jews.
But Jews do not fight.
These Jews do.
We will see.
JEWISH LIVING AREA
DO NOT ENTER
Send us your best fighters.
We are honored to be of service.
Buried underneath
with this detonator,...
..almost touching the rail.
As the train passes its weight
causes pressure...
..on the detonator...
..and then...
Boom!
You are related to Bielski?
I am Bielski.
More dead soldiers than empty bottles.
That is so... Russian.
At least you drink like a Russian.
A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.
What is it we are good for, Viktor?
Dying.
That's what we are good at.
Tell me about this brother of yours.
Oh, yes.
The Great Tuvia Bielski,
Savior of the Jews,
and all around big shit.
You compete with him.
He competes with me.
My older brother and I
have the same relationship.
He's a big shit also?
A soldier.
He was killed in the first hour
of the German invasion.
Every time we try to move,...
..they radio back
to the transmitter at police HQ.
So we attack the transmitter.
Yes, my Hebrew Warrior.
Except the place
is swarming with police.
What's this, two Bielskis at once?
To what do we owe this honor?
We have sickness. I need ampicillin.
Medicine's only for fighters.
If we have typhus
it may spread to your camp.
I will have to take that chance.
I must insist.
Comrade.
You'd better not.
There is medicine
in the Stankiewcze police station, yes?
Tuvia and I grew up there.
The Bielski Otriad
can destroy the transmitter.
Forgive me, Commander.
Zus. Join us.
I want to report
the mistreatment of a comrade.
This man beat Comrade Lova
for no reason at all.
I had a perfectly good reason.
He is a Jew.
And you are a savage.
Ignore him.
Let's drink.
Anti-Semitism...
..is a violation of Party discipline.
Gramov.
Apologize to our comrade.
I apologize,
Comrade Jew.
Let's have a drink.
Drink!
- He says he has a wife and children.
- So did I!
The attack is coming.
We're leaving the forest.
Leaving?
What about the Bielski Otriad?
What about them?
They will be slaughtered.
My priority
is the lives of Soviet soldiers.
The Bielskis are sacrificed
so that we can escape?
Everyone must sacrifice
so that we can keep fighting.
They're my brothers.
We are all brothers.
Comrade Bielski.
Your Jewish sentimentality
is heart-warming,
but counter-revolutionary!
You and your comrades
will follow Gramov,...
..and retreat as I have ordered!
And if I don't?
You'll be shot.
Comrade Bielski.
You are a soldier of the Motherland.
Thank you for the honor, Comrade.
