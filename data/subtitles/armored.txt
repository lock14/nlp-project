1
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,758
Rise and shine. Let's go.
Gonna miss the bus. Get up.

2
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,440
Please stop acting like Dad.

3
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,325
Boy, I don't got time for this.
Get up. I'm gonna be late.

4
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,364
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

5
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,118
Come on, man.

6
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:34,519
Negative on that, Control.
We're short-handed already.

7
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:59,920
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
M4 Benelli scattergun.

8
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,203
State of the art.

9
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,236
Yeah, boys.

10
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,646
I wish somebody would mess with us
on the... What?

11
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,962
Looks like the devil made that.

12
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,717
Cut the shit, Palmer.

13
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:19,404
You and the devil was real tight
not too long ago, huh?

14
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,202
God saved my life, yes...

15
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,923
...and he could still save yours.

16
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,757
- What's up?
- Good morning.

17
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:31,044
- Good morning.
- Yo, yo, little Mike.

18
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,881
Check this baby out.

19
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,445
What do you think of that?

20
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,325
Looks like you're overcompensating.

21
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,035
What are you talking about?

22
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,357
- What am I talking about?
- What you talking about?

23
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:46,486
You know what they say.
Bigger the gun, smaller the pistol.

24
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,917
Okay, okay.
Good one, good one, good one.

25
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,397
Oh, you know. Shit, I'm gonna
remember that shit. That's all right.

26
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,877
Next Monday, Teams 1, 3, 5 and 7...

27
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:03,438
...will commence training
on the new 425X7 ACTs.

28
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:07,316
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are entering the modern age.

29
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:11,241
All new trucks
will be equipped with GPS.

30
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,796
This is mandatory training...

31
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,962
...and I will accept no excuses.

32
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,640
No hall passes.

33
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,957
Ten-four, Control.

34
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,838
Eagle Shield 32,
check in on your next job.

35
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,918
Yeah, Eagle Shield 32.

36
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:11,126
Yeah, we're 10-5 on that drop.

37
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,323
Twenty minutes, 32.

38
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,883
Yeah, 10-4, thanks.

39
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:24,598
Your next scheduled check-in after
drop will be in 30 minutes. Stand by.

40
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,363
Eagle 24, we're 2400 block,
Madison.

41
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:36,319
Two-four, stand by.
Tow is en route to 24.

42
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:43,836
What's going on?

43
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,601
I got a black van.
He circled us twice.

44
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,996
All right, eyes and ears open.

45
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,839
Ten-four.

46
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,205
I wish they would try something.

47
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,240
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

48
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,000
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

49
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,522
Ty, keep your eyes open.

50
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,323
- I don't know. She just cut out on me.
- Check your gauges.

51
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:05,598
Everything looks good.

52
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,803
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa.

53
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,685
You smell that? Anybody smell that?

54
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,725
Sm... Smell... Smell what?
I don't smell nothing, Baines.

55
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:16,721
I smell it. Burnt sugar.
Somebody got to the fuel line.

56
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:18,639
- No, this ain't good.
- Team 12 to Base.

57
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,843
- This ain't good.
- Team 12 to Base, come in.

58
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,043
Keep keying that thing.
Keep keying it.

59
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,516
Team 12 to Base, come in,
goddamn it. Where are you?

60
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,281
- We got a code black here.
- Come on. What's going on?

61
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,280
- Keep keying the thing.
- I am, I am, I'm trying.

62
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,964
Come on.

63
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,760
Team 12 to Base, come in.

64
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,838
Where the hell are you?
We got a code black.

65
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,759
- We're in a dead zone.
- Damn.

66
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:43,121
Holy shit.

67
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,718
Holy shit, holy shit. Holy shit!

68
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:50,845
- Seat belt's stuck.
- Hit the deep locks.

69
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,406
My seat belt's stuck.

70
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,561
- Keep keying it! Keep keying it!
- She won't turn over!

71
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:00,520
Bomb!

72
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,556
Come on.

73
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,236
Come on.

74
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,796
She won't turn over.
She won't turn over!

75
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:23,039
- I can't take it.
- "Bomb!"

76
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,759
- We got you, man.
- We got you, man.

77
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,565
We got you.

78
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,326
Oh, buddy, you did great.

79
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,047
- You were quiet in the crisis, man.
- Jesus.

80
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,883
Oh, no, can't get his belt off!

81
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:46,161
You should have seen
the look on your face.

82
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,205
Don't worry. Dobbsie was crying
when we did it to him.

83
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,119
No, no, no. Don't... Don't...

84
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,040
We had to change your diaper.
What the hell...?

85
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,606
Hey, hey, hey.

86
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,758
I tried to stop them, bro, all right?

87
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,440
You're supposed to have my back.

88
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,757
Hold on. Hold on.

89
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,041
I got something I'd like to say.

90
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,799
Hold on a second.

91
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,522
You know, when your old man
asked me to be your godfather...

92
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,882
...that was a big moment in my life.

93
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:17,801
He was a great mentor to me...

94
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,039
...and he was...
He was my best friend.

95
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:25,485
I don't know how much of this
he expressed to you...

96
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,196
...how deeply proud he was of you
when you joined the service.

97
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:34,122
And I know both he and your mom
would be proud...

98
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:38,963
...to see the way that you stepped up
for your brother, Jimmy.

99
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,522
- Real proud.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:43,120
And I'm proud of you too.

101
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:48,157
So let's take a moment
to lift up our glasses to Ty.

102
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,165
- To Ty, Jr.
- To Ty.

103
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,238
- Ty.
- Ty.

104
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,238
You passed your probation.

105
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:55,760
Starting tomorrow...

106
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:59,203
...you're a full-fledged guard
with Eagle Shield Security.

107
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,517
- To Eagle Shield.
- Eagle Shield!

108
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,445
Eagle Shield Security.

109
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,398
- Ty.
- Here's to it.

110
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,000
They dropped a power line
on the truck.

111
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,959
Fifty thousand volts.

112
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,197
Fried everybody inside.

113
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,996
They were lucky they went fast.

114
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,757
- Remember Omaha?
- Oh, man.

115
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,600
Yeah, they tried to use
a demolition charge to blow the door.

116
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,758
The door held...

117
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,918
...but the fuel tank went up in flames.

118
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,476
They were cooked alive.

119
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,081
So has Eagle Shield
ever got jacked?

120
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:38,001
Once. A couple of guards
got killed in a five-man ambush.

121
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,160
How much they get?

122
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:44,878
Not one dollar. The last guard
in the crew dropped all five of them.

123
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,515
- One guard?
- Yes.

124
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:48,876
Ashcroft.

125
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,196
Ashcroft? Our Ashcroft?

126
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,801
- That's why he's got the cane.
- No.

127
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,845
Still carrying a couple of slugs
in his back.

128
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,556
I got an even better one.
Back in October of '88...

129
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,037
...a crew making a $4-million
cash transfer to Abilene...

130
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,159
...stopped at a car accident.

131
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:10,478
Only it wasn't an accident,
it was a setup.

132
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:14,162
The guard who got out of the truck,
well, they just grabbed him...

133
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,046
...put a sawed-off shotgun
to the back of his head.

134
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,441
Then what happened?

135
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:23,720
Crew just gave up the money
and they let the guard go.

136
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,400
The guards just gave up the money?

137
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,321
It was either that
or sacrifice one of their brothers.

138
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,765
The funny thing about it is...

139
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,760
...they still never caught up
with those hijackers.

140
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,804
- Right?
- Nope.

141
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,041
And they never
found that money either.

142
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,039
See...

143
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,880
...not everybody's a hero,
soldier boy.

144
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,602
So when are you gonna tell us
about all them kills...

145
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,042
...you got over there in Baghdad?

146
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,923
We'd like to hear about that.

147
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:02,445
I gotta take a leak.

148
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:11,238
You're out of line, man.

149
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,125
You should be proud
of what you did over there.

150
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,965
I'm not.

151
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,439
A lot of innocent people
died out there.

152
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:42,681
Right, right. But you were just trying
to protect the guys in your unit.

153
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:46,882
Those guys were your brothers.

154
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,201
Anybody would've done
the same thing.

155
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:56,556
So you'd think.
That's what you'd think.

156
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,603
We're not gonna let the bank
take your house.

157
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,918
- I got that under control.
- Hey, don't bullshit me, Ty.

158
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,476
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna think of something.

159
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,926
All right.

160
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,600
Say hi to Jimmy.

161
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,997
- Drive safe, man.
- All right.

162
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,199
Jimmy.

163
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,846
Jimmy?

164
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,446
Jimmy, let's eat.

165
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,440
Jimmy.

166
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,319
Jimmy!

167
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,078
What are you doing?

168
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,444
Your bedroom is one thing.
You know this is the kitchen, right?

169
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,560
What's for dinner?

170
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,479
I'm starved.

171
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,241
"I'm starved."

172
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,956
You're really testing me, bro.

173
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,439
Every day.

174
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:38,883
- Every day, it's something with you.
- What took you so long?

175
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,199
What took...? No, Jimmy.

176
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,039
Where'd you get the supplies?

177
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,597
You ain't getting no money from me,
so where are you getting it, Jimmy?

178
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,396
You better not be stealing it from
the store. Where'd you get them?

179
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,320
No, man. I'm not stealing them
from the store.

180
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,478
Okay, tell me something.

181
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:59,763
But school has a real nice supply.

182
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,199
School.

183
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,718
Boy.

184
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,365
At least you're going to school, man.

185
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:18,760
In the kitchen.

186
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,037
Remember how Dad
used to always freak Mom out...

187
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,765
...and tell her all those stories?

188
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,326
Yeah, I remember.

189
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,445
Like there was an owl
living in the attic.

190
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,283
There was an owl up there.

191
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,766
- Come on.
- What?

192
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,716
- A real owl?
- A real owl.

193
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,200
You think it's gone too?

194
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,039
You got skills, man.

195
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,400
Thanks.

196
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:06,802
All right, listen up.

197
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,838
One more thing.

198
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,404
As I was getting the collections
together for Freddy's widow...

199
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,765
...I found this.

200
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,877
"For a good time, call 555-0125."

201
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,879
You're sick, Baines. You need help.

202
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,163
How you know it was me?
Did you call the number, chief?

203
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,276
I can't believe you let your sister
marry this pig.

204
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,324
She was always
bringing home strays.

205
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,399
You know, maybe she's got a thing
for sick animals.

206
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:53,037
- That's you, that's you.
- All right, settle down, settle down.

207
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,959
Tomorrow begins the CCD cycle...

208
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,164
...so if you can't be here on time,
be early.

209
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:03,757
And I expect each of you
to pay extra special attention to detail.

210
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,237
Half our ACTs will be carrying
HC priority loads.

211
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,682
Yeah, I got his priority load.

212
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:15,277
- Keep your eyes open out there.
- Open out there.

213
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,525
- Hey, you got a second, Top?
- What is it, Hackett?

214
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:32,604
Hey, I was wondering if you could
throw a few more shifts my way.

215
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:38,125
Yeah, I know. I know it's a problem.
But I just need some help, man.

216
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,199
Getting letters from the bank,
some real ugly letters.

217
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:45,044
I'm sorry, kid.
Not enough to go around.

218
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,278
All right. Thanks, Top.

219
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,359
Eagle 12 to Control.

220
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,118
We're code five and en route.

221
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,245
Copy, Truck 12.
Next radio check-in in 15 minutes.

222
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,045
Eagle 12, out.

223
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:21,518
I think I know what happened
to that money.

224
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,437
The Abilene job.

225
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,276
They never caught those guys
because they don't exist.

226
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,681
Crew hid the 4 million.

227
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:36,524
And then they just made up that story
about getting jacked.

228
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,759
Hide the money, fake being jacked.
That's classic.

229
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:41,679
That's pretty good, huh?

230
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,077
The only thing is,
they made one big mistake.

231
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,362
What's that?

232
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,362
They didn't take enough.

233
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,436
This is the bank.

234
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,445
What?

235
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,041
It's trying to take the house.

236
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:18,960
You know, the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

237
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,561
- Shit, I don't know what that means.
- Well...

238
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:27,479
...your dad worked two jobs,
barely made ends meet, right?

239
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,596
And then, God bless them,
but he and your mother die...

240
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,725
...and they leave you with
a house with two mortgages...

241
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,037
...and a pile of hospital bills.

242
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,997
That's not what they wanted for you.

243
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:42,318
They wanted you to
get out of this place...

244
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:45,047
...and have the life
that they never had.

245
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,278
And now look at you.

246
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,839
Here you are in the same old shit.

247
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,957
Guys like your old man
used to bust their hump...

248
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,357
...working in places like this.

249
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,880
Then you go off to Iraq,
you serve your country...

250
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,357
...and you earn a Silver Star.

251
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,199
For what?

252
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,477
Don't get me started.

253
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,527
Come on, let's get something to eat.

254
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:25,916
I'd get you another one,
but you usually stop at four.

255
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,486
Thanks, Joe. Take another Coke.

256
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:29,126
- You got it.
- Thanks.

257
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,397
You really love them, don't you?

258
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:40,563
My father used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

259
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,718
We'd put away four of those things
apiece.

260
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,196
- Every time I eat those, I'm...
- Any available unit...

261
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:49,201
...we have reported gunshots in
the vicinity of Franklin and Durango.

262
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,278
- Unit 8, show en route.
- Ten-four, 8.

263
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:52,880
- Thanks, Joe.
- Get me next time.

264
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,321
I'll get you this time.

265
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,565
You be safe.

266
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,923
This is one spot in the old 'hood
that's gonna be here forever.

267
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,879
- Hey, Joe.
- What's up, Joe?

268
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,845
Two regulars, one with cheese.

269
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,475
- And get me another one to go.
- Another one to go.

270
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:28,205
- For Jimmy.
- Thanks, man.

271
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,164
How's he doing?

272
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,797
Driving me crazy.

273
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,356
- It's hard for him, you know?
- Yeah.

274
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,879
I hear you.

275
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,526
You know...

276
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,959
...I really appreciate
everything you do, man.

277
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:53,397
- What, are you kidding me?
- Well, you do a lot, man.

278
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:56,004
You're like family to me, man.

279
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,603
You and Jimmy.
You'll always be family to me.

280
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,398
I'm really starting to feel it, Mike.

281
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,806
The whole damn world, bro.

282
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,722
Have you talked to Jimmy
about the situation?

283
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:20,403
He knows the bank wants the house,
but he thinks I'll figure it out.

284
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:25,206
- Good dog, Joe.
- Thanks.

285
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,085
Listen.

286
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,196
Let's take a walk.

287
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:31,881
There's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

288
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,436
- Thanks, Joe.
- All right. See you around.

289
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:41,523
Tomorrow's the start
of a new CCD cycle.

290
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,761
It only happens twice a year.

291
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:47,681
Yeah, I heard this morning.
"Can't be on time, be early."

292
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:49,281
Yeah.

293
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:53,759
The banks will be looking
to crown their vault reserves...

294
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:57,876
...which means we'll be transporting
something in the neighbourhood of...

295
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,319
...42 million.

296
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:03,877
Damn. That's a lot of money.

297
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,158
Damn straight.

298
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,484
So...

299
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,326
So think about it.

300
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,837
Think we might get jacked?

301
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:17,998
As a matter of fact, I do.

302
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,156
We're gonna take that money, Ty.

303
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:24,558
You, me, Baines, Quinn,
Palmer and Dobbs.

304
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,716
What?

305
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,162
It's gonna be just like
the Abilene job...

306
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,444
...only we don't make
the same mistake they did.

307
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:33,325
We're going big.

308
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,925
Come on.

309
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,760
What, you think last week
was a joke?

310
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:40,565
It was a test run.

311
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:44,083
Because that's exactly the way
this robbery's gonna play out.

312
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,881
It's our alibi. We stash the money...

313
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,238
...and we tell them we got jacked.

314
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,917
You're planning to yank $42 million?

315
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,443
No. We're planning
on yanking $42 million.

316
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,086
Because I need you in this.

317
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:03,284
- Are you crazy?
- It's gonna work. Think about it.

318
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,803
- The cops are gonna be all over you.
- Forget the cops.

319
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,757
Of course they'll be all over us
in the beginning.

320
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:13,761
But we got a rock-solid alibi,
and all we gotta do is stick with it.

321
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:16,122
- The trucks, Mike.
- We're gonna torch the trucks.

322
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,323
- No evidence.
- "We're gonna torch the trucks"?

323
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,717
- Are you listening to yourself?
- Ty, it's clean.

324
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,320
It's clean.

325
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,239
Come on, man.
There's no bad guys.

326
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,560
Look, there's just us.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

327
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:28,836
Think about it.

328
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,157
There's nothing to think about.
I'm not doing it.

329
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,205
- All right.
- Me and Jimmy, we gonna be all right.

330
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,724
Look, look, I understand.
You're a little bit worked up about this.

331
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:42,005
I don't blame you.
It's a little last-minute, I understand.

332
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:47,124
I want you to go home, sleep on it.

333
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:51,401
And if you want in,
be at the bus stop in the morning.

334
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,519
I won't be there.

335
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:55,484
- All right. Where you going?
- I'm walking.

336
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,207
- I'll drive you.
- I need the fresh air.

337
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,597
Ty, come on.

338
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,441
Promise me
you're gonna think about it.

339
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,404
Ty!

340
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,678
Come on, man.

341
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:12,645
Look.

342
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:19,442
All right,
I know I can trust you with this.

343
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,446
Ty.

344
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:33,519
This lady came here to see you.
She's from Child Welfare.

345
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,245
Sir, are you Mr. Tyler Hackett?

346
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,841
- Child Welfare, Ty.
- Yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

347
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:41,716
- What's going on? What's going on?
- Kept telling her we ain't on welfare...

348
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,286
...but she didn't wanna listen.

349
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:46,484
And I've tried to explain
it's not that kind of welfare.

350
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,366
- Child Supervision and Services.
- Whatever, lady. Whatever.

351
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,995
My brother got a job, okay?
We don't need no welfare.

352
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,998
Jimmy, shut up!

353
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,844
Okay?

354
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:00,596
Come in.

355
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:01,836
In the past 10 months...

356
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,760
...during the little time
he's actually appeared at school...

357
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:08,237
...James has had two suspensions,
four arrests.

358
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,444
For tagging. He's artsy.

359
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,997
Look at that. Tell me that's not art.

360
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,845
Okay. Come on, lady.

361
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,804
He's a good kid.

362
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,877
When I was his age,
I was hot-wiring cars.

363
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,920
Okay.

364
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,486
That came out wrong.

365
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:35,399
Your brother's school
has notified us...

366
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,877
...he's missed more days
than he's attended this year.

367
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,722
What's she talking about, Jimmy?

368
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,676
I asked you a question, boy.

369
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,440
I was looking for a job
so we could keep the house.

370
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:53,644
- You're losing your house?
- No, we're not losing the house.

371
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:56,719
You have to understand, if James
doesn't have the proper lodging...

372
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,878
I didn't know he was missing school.

373
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,327
As a result,
the Department of Child Welfare...

374
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,126
...is legally obligated
to intervene on James' behalf...

375
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,245
...to determine if he's a candidate
for state-funded care.

376
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:10,642
Foster care.

377
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:14,845
No, foster care,
that must be a mistake.

378
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,601
I'm Jimmy's legal guardian.
I take care of him.

379
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:21,363
Okay, all right.

380
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:23,760
I admit it's been tough.

381
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:29,324
He lost both...
We lost both our parents this year.

382
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:34,275
- I understand, Mr. Hackett...
- Nobody's splitting us up, lady.

383
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:38,604
He's my brother.
You know what that means, huh?

384
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,316
I'm all he's got. He's all I got.

385
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:48,283
Nobody's splitting us up.

386
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,800
Period.

387
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,117
No one gets hurt, right?

388
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,566
How?

389
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,083
There's no bad guys.

390
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,760
Only good guys.

391
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,398
Jimmy needs me.

392
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,559
I cannot go to jail.

393
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,605
You hear me?

394
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,163
No more blood on my hands.

395
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,917
Promise me nobody gets hurt.

396
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:59,760
Nobody gets hurt. That's a promise.

397
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:42,001
Hackett, hold up a minute.

398
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,161
Came in today.

399
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:53,843
It's official, kid.
Now you've got the tin to prove it.

400
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:58,002
I want you to know it's an honour
having a decorated veteran on my crew.

401
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:02,718
I mean that.

402
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,843
Come on, let's roll out.

403
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:09,445
Gentlemen.

404
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,159
- Courtesy transport 3489.
- Copy that.

405
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,922
- Reserves, Federal Reserve Bank.
- It's fine.

406
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:29,006
- Yeah, that's right, that's right.
- We all done? All right.

407
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,646
All right, gentlemen.

408
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:33,836
All right.

409
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,123
- We're all good.
- Let's roll out.

410
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,078
It's time to check in.

411
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:30,439
Eagle 12, Control.

412
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,319
Go ahead, 12.

413
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:35,723
Twelve is...

414
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:39,800
Code five.

415
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,358
Code five.

416
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:49,886
Situation normal. We're on Jefferson
headed back to the barn.

417
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,239
Copy, 12.

418
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:56,079
Next check-in in 58 minutes.

419
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,925
Copy that. Eagle 12, out.

420
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,156
- That's beautiful.
- See what I mean?

421
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:06,443
- You smell that?
- Yes. The smell of freedom.

422
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:08,598
No. Smells like ours.

423
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,440
Baines, stop that. You want the cops
smelling booze on you?

424
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,996
- Come on, put it away. Put it away.
- Okay, okay, okay.

425
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,123
All right, look, we got 51 minutes...

426
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:19,120
...to stash this money and then
get jacked. Let's go. Come on.

427
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:20,846
Come on.

428
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,886
Take that gear off. I got a job for you.
Let's go. Let's go.

429
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,566
Now is not the time to pray.

430
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,516
- Come on, Hackett.
- All right, keep it moving.

431
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,121
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep it moving.

432
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,276
That's it.

433
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,484
Put the money in these bags.
Put them in the hole, all right?

434
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,081
Keep it moving. Let's go.

435
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,886
Come on, guys.
Let's move, let's move.

436
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:46,162
All right, let's go.

437
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:49,125
- Keep it coming. Come on.
- All this money.

438
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,996
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

439
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,241
Here it comes, here it comes.

440
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:00,398
- Come on, come on.
- All right, keep it coming.

441
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:14,636
- That's it. This one's empty.
- All right.

442
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,798
Last one, let's go.

443
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,636
Someone's here.

444
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:06,199
Easy, Grandpa.

445
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,485
Easy.

446
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,244
Mike. Mike. Mike.

447
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:25,846
Wait, wait. Wait one sec.
Let's just put the money back.

448
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,440
- I don't like this, Mike.
- Shit!

449
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,120
Everybody, okay, let's stay calm.

450
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:31,323
- He saw our faces, man!
- We let him go!

451
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,318
He saw our freaking faces, man!

452
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,964
- Shit.
- Are you out of your mind?

453
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,286
Hey, calm down!
Calm down right now!

454
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,636
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you all right?

455
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:56,401
- Come on, chief. You wanna go?
- Just calm down.

456
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:58,326
Let him go.

457
00:40:58,487 --> 00:40:59,602
- Let him go.
- You're crazy.

458
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,962
- Come on! Come on, chief!
- Ty, where you going?

459
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:05,042
Ty, he's not gonna make it.

460
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:06,761
Ty, stop!

461
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,441
I had to do it.

462
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,800
I had no choice.

463
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,080
I do.

464
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,046
No, you don't.

465
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:36,206
Mike.

466
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:46,476
Come on, Ty.

467
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:48,880
Open up.

468
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:50,480
We gotta figure this thing out.

469
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:53,400
You just shot that...
You just killed that man.

470
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,762
He was gonna die
before you got him to a hospital.

471
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:59,476
- You don't know that. You don't!
- Yes, I do, and so do you.

472
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:03,003
Look. Ty, he was gonna
land us in jail anyway.

473
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,998
Don't you understand?

474
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:09,359
Ty, open this door so we can figure
this thing out together like a team.

475
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,599
You just want me
to walk out there, huh?

476
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,200
Baines just tried to kill me!

477
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,483
Forget Baines.
I'll deal with Baines, I promise.

478
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,117
- Your promises don't mean shit.
- Look, I admit Baines screwed up.

479
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,956
You're absolutely right about that.

480
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:26,159
But I didn't want us
to all go down for his mistake.

481
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,086
We gotta clean this up.

482
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,876
If we keep our cool,
this thing could still work.

483
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,318
Think about Jimmy.

484
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:38,596
He needs you.

485
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,040
Control?

486
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,121
Control, Eagle 12, this is Eagle...

487
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:53,200
Come on, Ty. Come on,
we can still make this work.

488
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,082
Open the door.

489
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,443
Open this door!

490
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:27,161
- Hear that, Joe?
- Hear what?

491
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:38,799
Pop the hood.

492
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:50,447
Get out of the truck. Come on.

493
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,798
- We're dead, man.
- No, it's gonna be okay.

494
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,925
- Just be cool. We stick to the plan.
- Stick to the plan?

495
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,476
- Shooting that guy part of the plan?
- Stop whining.

496
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,599
Maybe he's right, we should leave.

497
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,200
- And go where?
- I don't know.

498
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,359
You guys can sit here and you can
wait for the cops. I am done.

499
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:18,439
- You're not going anywhere.
- Dobbs is right.

500
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:22,804
In 40 minutes, when we fail
to check in with Ashcroft...

501
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,527
...this whole area
is gonna be crawling with cops.

502
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:32,198
Here's what we can do. We can
forget about the money in my truck...

503
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:36,163
...and take the 21 mil from
Quinn's truck and split it up five ways.

504
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,476
Still a lot of money.

505
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:40,764
It's a lot of money. But then what?

506
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,397
Cat's out of the bag now.

507
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,404
This changes everything.

508
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:49,639
- Well, what do we do?
- Yeah, what do you wanna do, Mike?

509
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:55,801
We get the kid out of the truck.

510
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:57,366
How?

511
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,996
- The hinges.
- Hinges?

512
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,280
Those hinges are tempered steel.

513
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:04,641
Yeah, but the pins aren't.

514
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:09,244
If we can drive the pins through,
the hinges will come undone.

515
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,563
We got less than 40 minutes
to do this.

516
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,235
- And then what?
- And then...

517
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:17,357
...when the cops arrive...

518
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:21,636
...we tell them that Ty died
saving our lives.

519
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:25,363
- That he died a hero.
- That'll work.

520
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,285
All you had to do was open the door.

521
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,396
Come on, let's get something
to open this goddamn hinge.

522
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,597
I would've protected you.

523
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,365
Jesus!

524
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,883
All right, well, let's go.
We got 36 minutes.

525
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:53,679
Eagle 24, what's your 10-20?

526
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,840
Request for 500,000 CTO
from WLH Trust.

527
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:03,956
- Hold for 12 and 17.
- You got it, boss.

528
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:06,004
They're due in 30.

529
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,723
- Come on, give it to me.
- Okay.

530
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:17,843
All right, you and me. Let's go.

531
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:47,560
Mike.
Come on, this is taking too long.

532
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,405
- You got a better idea?
- Keep going.

533
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:03,279
Dobbs.

534
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,759
Dobbs.

535
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:19,760
What?

536
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,844
Help me, man.

537
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:25,358
I can't.

538
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,640
- You should've stuck with us.
- Come on, Dobbs.

539
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:32,806
We're not murderers.

540
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:55,283
Just help me out, man.
You gotta help me out.

541
00:50:57,207 --> 00:50:58,765
No.

542
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,044
No, I don't.

543
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:12,604
- Gonna come out now?
- What are you doing?

544
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,564
What's it look like I'm doing?

545
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,958
Hey, come on, Baines.

546
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:20,766
Are you out of your mind?

547
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:23,725
You want some?

548
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:25,366
Come on.

549
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:27,202
Hey!

550
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:28,561
Hey! Hey!

551
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:30,445
Let him go! Come on!

552
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:34,481
Come on!

553
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:37,286
Come on! Come on! Come on!

554
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:43,283
Goddamn it! You broke my tooth,
you damn moron.

555
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:45,246
Next time I'll break your head.

556
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,841
You burn the truck,
you burn the money, you idiot.

557
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:50,567
I'm gonna tell your sister
you called me that.

558
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:17,557
Unit 8 to Dispatch.

559
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:22,805
Dispatch.

560
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:50,525
Sorry.

561
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:53,597
Okay, keep going.

562
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:11,686
Cops! There's a cop car coming.

563
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:34,478
- He stopped.
- I can take care of it.

564
00:53:34,647 --> 00:53:37,844
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, he's not here for us.

565
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,204
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get rid of him.

566
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,080
- Hey there.
- Hey!

567
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:47,842
Hey. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

568
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,685
Is everything okay?

569
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:53,635
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a security guard. Yeah.

570
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:56,924
Yeah, I also do
some maintenance work as well.

571
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:59,726
Yeah. Is everything okay?

572
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:02,719
I thought I heard a siren.

573
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:08,079
Siren? No, no sirens here.
At least to the best of my knowledge.

574
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,875
What do they need security
at an abandoned building for?

575
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:13,443
Well, it's for insurance purposes.

576
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:15,404
They've got vagrants
running around here.

577
00:54:15,647 --> 00:54:19,276
They're stealing copper
and just stripping the place clean.

578
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,758
It's really terrible.

579
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:24,323
I heard some banging too.

580
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,880
Where?

581
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,118
Couldn't tell you where from.

582
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:36,402
I've had to chase them
out of here numerous times.

583
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:40,082
They're mostly bums, but if one of
them gets hurt, the owner's still liable.

584
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:43,520
- Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
- Yeah.

585
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,320
So...

586
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,763
...there's nothing over here
in this particular unit.

587
00:54:49,927 --> 00:54:51,724
Sounded like it was coming
from in there.

588
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:55,880
Yeah, I just came from in there
and I didn't see anything.

589
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:58,481
Of course, I don't like
going in there much, you know.

590
00:54:58,647 --> 00:55:02,003
I can show you around,
but you might wanna cover your nose.

591
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:03,520
Why's that?

592
00:55:03,687 --> 00:55:05,484
An old dog crawled in there
and died.

593
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,356
The rats have eaten most of him. The
stench is so bad, it'll make you puke.

594
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:17,645
They've got these rats,
they're the size of a big old fat cat.

595
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,919
Come on in, I'll show you the dog.

596
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:21,998
- I'll take your word for it.
- You sure?

597
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,486
Yeah.

598
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:28,238
Well, thanks for stopping by.

599
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:30,796
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

600
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,156
Come on. Help me get him inside.

601
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:05,996
- Should've never trusted you.
- He was coming inside!

602
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,441
He heard the siren!

603
00:56:07,607 --> 00:56:10,075
- What was I supposed to do?
- Damn it.

604
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:13,516
What the hell was that?

605
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:16,520
I didn't know what else to do!
What else did you want me to do?

606
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:18,518
He was coming inside! Damn it!

607
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,200
Come on.

608
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,197
No, no, no!

609
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,205
What the hell is wrong with you?

610
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:31,801
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He was coming inside!

611
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:33,760
He was coming inside!

612
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,644
Oh, shit.

613
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:50,397
Don't look at me like that.

614
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,922
- What did you want me to do?
- You did this, man.

615
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,726
- Yeah, yeah, he's alive.
- Move your head!

616
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,964
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

617
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:06,360
Fuck!

618
00:57:07,847 --> 00:57:08,916
No!

619
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:11,442
No, no, no.

620
00:57:14,887 --> 00:57:17,606
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

621
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:37,758
Okay, okay, okay, hang on.

622
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:39,599
God. What's happening to me?

623
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,156
You're just going into shock.
Okay? All right.

624
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,446
- I need you to stay with me.
- What's happening to me?

625
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,726
Okay, okay, all right.

626
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:07,639
Just look at me, look at me,
look at me.

627
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:10,241
Okay, I need you to breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

628
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:12,877
There we go. Slow and steady.
That's better.

629
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:16,437
I'm gonna have to clean this up
and stop the bleeding. All right? Okay.

630
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,165
Fuck!

631
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:29,565
All right.

632
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:30,836
I got an idea.

633
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,521
Pressure, pressure, pressure.
Keep pressure on the wound.

634
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:37,043
Can you do that, huh?
Can you hear me? All right. All right.

635
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,835
Okay, I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call in and report you.

636
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:43,683
Officer down. Officer down.

637
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:53,041
Okay, all right.
We just stop the bleeding...

638
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:55,767
...we can wait this out.
Me and you. Okay?

639
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:58,077
You're not dying today. Okay.

640
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:09,201
What's your name, man?

641
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:12,243
Eckehart. Jake Eckehart.

642
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,523
Jake. How long until
your backup comes?

643
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:16,080
I don't know, an hour maybe.

644
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:18,715
There was a glitch.
I'm bleeding again, man.

645
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:21,447
I know, I know. Keep pressure on it,
keep pressure on it.

646
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:23,199
- Okay? All right?
- Okay.

647
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:24,561
You gotta breathe, though.

648
00:59:25,007 --> 00:59:28,636
Breathe. The more you breathe,
the less it hurts.

649
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,644
Come on, Palmer.

650
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:50,603
You watch my hand.

651
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:56,919
Ty?

652
01:00:58,647 --> 01:01:00,046
Ty?

653
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:05,560
Ty?

654
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,125
Are you home?

655
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:13,205
Ty?

656
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:16,846
Ty?

657
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:34,600
Is he still alive?

658
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:37,998
He's not gonna be
if we don't get help soon.

659
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:40,918
Okay, listen to me.

660
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:44,005
Cochrane pulled the main fuse
from the engine.

661
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:45,562
It's in his coat pocket.

662
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,962
- I'm scared, Ty.
- Dobbs.

663
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:50,886
I need you to get it.

664
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:54,076
It's our only way out of here.

665
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,604
Get it, Dobbs.

666
01:01:58,167 --> 01:01:59,805
Get it.

667
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:11,956
He's doing it.

668
01:02:13,087 --> 01:02:17,205
He's doing it.
Nice. Nice and easy now.

669
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:19,116
I don't know what we're doing here...

670
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,605
...anymore, man.
- I know.

671
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,604
This is not what we agreed to,
Mike. I mean...

672
01:03:28,727 --> 01:03:30,319
Palmer.

673
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:33,445
Don't let them do anything to me,
man, please?

674
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:38,365
I won't.

675
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:44,959
Okay.

676
01:03:45,847 --> 01:03:48,725
Okay. All right, man.

677
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:12,722
I'm sorry, man.

678
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:14,002
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

679
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,998
- It's okay.
- I can't do it.

680
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,158
- I know, I know. I know.
- I can't do it.

681
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:20,124
I just wanna go home.

682
01:04:20,287 --> 01:04:23,597
I wanna go home, man.
I wanna see my kid and...

683
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:28,002
- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry.

684
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:54,002
No one was supposed to get hurt.

685
01:04:56,247 --> 01:04:57,760
I'm gonna bleed to death.

686
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,362
- I need your radio.
- It's right here.

687
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,283
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us some cover.

688
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,839
Hey, Palmer.

689
01:05:43,127 --> 01:05:45,516
Palmer. Hold up.

690
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:51,121
Palmer? You with us?

691
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:53,676
Let's go. Get back to work.

692
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,196
What are you doing?

693
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:11,326
They can't see us, they don't know
what we're doing. Right?

694
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:16,198
- You with me? You with me?
- Yeah.

695
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,801
- All right. Hang tight, hang tight.
- Yeah.

696
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:44,480
Hurry up.

697
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:48,084
Keep talking. Keep breathing.

698
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:52,485
- Talk to me, talk to me.
- I'm fine. I'm all right.

699
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:16,925
Yeah. Yeah.

700
01:07:40,007 --> 01:07:43,044
Okay. I'm going up to the roof.
I'm gonna try to get a signal.

701
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:45,721
Okay? You just keep pressure
on that thing. I'll be back.

702
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:47,240
Why would you come back?

703
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:51,926
Because I'm the reason
you're in this mess, Jake.

704
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:55,921
- Just stay put.
- Yeah.

705
01:09:42,687 --> 01:09:44,166
Come on.

706
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:57,919
- I think I heard something.
- What?

707
01:09:59,447 --> 01:10:00,880
Palmer.

708
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:02,958
Go check it out.

709
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,647
Let's go.

710
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:45,998
- Come on.
- Unit 8, what's your 20?

711
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:48,727
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have...
We have an officer down.

712
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:51,321
We have an officer down.
I need help.

713
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:53,443
What is your location?

714
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:58,004
We're at the Steele...
Steele Industry Center.

715
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:00,556
- State your name, please.
- Just...

716
01:11:00,727 --> 01:11:02,524
Just get here, please.

717
01:11:02,687 --> 01:11:04,962
Units en route, code three.

718
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:11,040
It's done.

719
01:11:13,327 --> 01:11:14,919
It's over.

720
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:17,239
You stupid kid.

721
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:19,602
Just put the gun down.

722
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:21,196
Okay?

723
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:26,198
Don't make it... Don't make it worse.
Just put the gun down.

724
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:28,956
Why couldn't you just go along?

725
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:32,123
Palmer, listen to me, just...

726
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,324
Just put the gun down.

727
01:11:34,647 --> 01:11:36,524
Okay, okay.

728
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,604
- You didn't hurt anybody.
- Shut up!

729
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,325
Shut your fucking mouth!

730
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,639
Okay.

731
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:46,075
You don't know a thing.

732
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:51,925
You don't want...
You don't wanna do this.

733
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,725
You don't wanna do this.

734
01:11:56,487 --> 01:11:57,476
Just put the gun...

735
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,036
Just put the gun down
and we both go home.

736
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:03,916
- We could go home. It's a bad day.
- Shut up! Shut up!

737
01:12:04,247 --> 01:12:06,477
Shut the hell up!

738
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:22,801
You think God will forgive me?

739
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,281
No, you can't go to sleep.
You can't go to sleep.

740
01:13:14,447 --> 01:13:17,120
Jake, you can't go to sleep.

741
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:20,562
They're coming. I got through.
I got through.

742
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:51,122
Jimmy. Don't you touch him!

743
01:13:52,487 --> 01:13:53,556
Get out of the truck.

744
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,156
I'm not messing around.

745
01:14:14,487 --> 01:14:16,717
Get out of the truck.

746
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:19,605
Ty.

747
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:22,726
- You got three seconds, Ty.
- Ty, help me.

748
01:14:22,887 --> 01:14:24,240
Come on, soldier boy.

749
01:14:24,407 --> 01:14:27,687
One, two...

750
01:14:54,287 --> 01:14:56,881
Ty? Ty? Ty?

751
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:16,085
All right.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

752
01:15:16,247 --> 01:15:18,283
Are you okay?

753
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,437
Come on, Jimmy, let's move!

754
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:29,086
Move!

755
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,041
You okay? You hurt?

756
01:15:38,807 --> 01:15:41,844
Okay, I'm gonna make sure the cops
know how to find us. I'll be back.

757
01:15:42,007 --> 01:15:46,046
- No, no, no, Ty.
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

758
01:15:47,447 --> 01:15:49,039
I'll be back.

759
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:52,565
All right?

760
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:01,642
Cop told us what you did.

761
01:19:08,887 --> 01:19:11,196
There's talk of a reward.

762
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,841
Hey.

763
01:19:23,447 --> 01:19:25,324
We going home?

764
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:31,196
Yeah.

765
01:19:39,548 --> 01:19:49,869
THE END
