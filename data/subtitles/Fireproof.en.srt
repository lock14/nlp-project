2
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,815
All right, sweet pea,
it's time for you to go to bed.

3
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,316
Mommy, would you ask Daddy
to come tuck me in?

4
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,818
No, he's at work tonight
at the fire station.

5
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,014
But he'll be home tomorrow night.

6
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,921
Mommy, l want to marry Daddy.

7
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,154
You do?
Catherine, you can't marry Daddy.

8
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,820
He's my husband.

9
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,433
Well, when you're done being married,
can l have him?

10
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,295
We'll never be done.
You'll have to marry somebody else.

11
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,135
Can l wear a white dress
and white gloves?

12
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,004
Sure, if you want to.

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,841
Will we live happily after ever?

14
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,579
lf you marry somebody
who really, really loves you.

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,379
Like Daddy?

16
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,148
Yes, like Daddy.

17
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,488
-Terrell, man, my bad out there.
-This ain't no game.

18
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,521
You playing with people lives.

19
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,352
Come on, man.

20
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,956
Eric, he's got a right to be upset.

21
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,759
You left him in a dangerous spot
and tried to be a hero.

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,902
l thought l heard someone
calling for help.

23
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,833
lt was coming
from outside the building.

24
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,337
lt was dark, l couldn't see.

25
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,772
That's why you stay with your partner.
He had to assume...

26
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,277
...that something happened to you
and you needed his help.

27
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,214
You never leave your partner,
especially in a fire.

28
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,821
You give him some time
and then give him an apology.

29
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,617
-And make it sincere.
-Yes, sir.

30
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,393
-Hey, Tasha.
-Oh, hey, Cat.

31
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,266
Just saw you on TV. Looking good.

32
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,203
Oh, l missed it. l was giving a tour
of the new cancer wing.

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,343
-Hey, has Robin left yet?
-No, she's here.

34
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,103
Robin, Cat's here.

35
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,610
-Hey.
-How are you?

36
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,941
l'm good. How are you?

37
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,946
Good.
Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?

38
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,813
Yeah, 4:00. You still want
those scented candles, right?

39
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,386
Oh, absolutely. Bring them on.

40
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,852
-l wanna try them all.
-Good.

41
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,888
l'm going to see my parents
this weekend.

42
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,892
-l thought they might like some too.
-Oh, how are they?

43
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,997
Do you know it's been a year
since Mom's stroke?

44
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,690
l've been trying to get her
a new bed and wheelchair...

45
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,563
...but their insurance
doesn't cover it.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,069
l don't know.
lt's so frustrating for my dad.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,038
He wants to help her too,
but he can't afford it either.

48
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,268
-l am so sorry.
-Yeah, it's all right.

49
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,175
Anyway, well, l need to run.

50
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,611
-But l'll see you tomorrow, right?
-l'll see you.

51
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,613
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

52
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,643
-Hey, Catherine.
-l'm so sorry, Dr. Keller.

53
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,516
Call me Gavin, please.

54
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,180
Gavin, sorry for almost
running you over.

55
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,328
-Anytime. lt's good to see you.
-You too. Take care.

56
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,492
Sweet girl.

57
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,594
-Tasha, will you file this for me?
-Sure, doctor.

58
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,540
lf l didn't know any better,
l'd say the doctor has a thing for Cat.

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,653
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hey, Daddy.

60
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,124
-How are you?
-Oh, great. Good to see you.

61
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,490
You too.

62
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,725
Hey, Mama. How are you, huh?

63
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,630
She's doing great today.

64
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,566
Can l get you
something to drink, dear?

65
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,974
-Do you have any sweet tea?
-With lemon?

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,973
You know me.

67
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,144
Oh, Mama, l wish we could talk.

68
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,512
lt's been so long
since l heard your voice.

69
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,054
l miss you.

70
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,217
-You have breakfast already?
-Yes.

71
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,085
-What'd you eat?
-l had the last bagel and a yogurt.

72
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,900
Are you planning
on making a grocery trip soon?

73
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,704
Caleb, you work 2 4 hours
and then you're off for 48.

74
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,933
-You've got more time to go than l do.
-l asked a simple question.

75
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,307
You don't need to get smart with me.
At least save me some breakfast.

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,449
l never know when you're coming
or going. You don't tell me.

77
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,311
Catherine, what is your problem?

78
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,578
Did l offend you
by walking in the door?

79
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,917
You can't expect me to work every day
and get the groceries...

80
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,651
...while you look at trash on the
lnternet dreaming about your boat.

81
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,488
You chose to take this job.

82
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,426
-No one said you had to work full-time.
-We need the income.

83
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,159
Especially since you tuck away
a third of your salary...

84
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,962
...saving for a boat we don't need.

85
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,005
You've got $2 4,000 in savings
when things in our house need fixing.

86
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,641
Like what?

87
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,676
The back door needs to be painted,
the yard needs landscaping.

88
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,040
And l wanna put more shelves
in the closet.

89
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,910
Those are called preferences.
Those are not needs.

90
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,451
There's a difference. lf you wanna
spend your money on that stuff, fine.

91
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,886
l've been saving for my boat for years.
You're not taking that from me.

92
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,355
This is so pointless.
l don't have time for this.

93
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,791
Yeah, shut the door
on your way out.

94
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,431
lt ain't working, Michael.

95
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,527
How is it that l get respect
everywhere l go...

96
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,567
...except in my own house?

97
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,299
l've been there,
and it's a hard place to be.

98
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,439
What'd you do about it?

99
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,913
l realized that it wasn't my marriage
that was broken.

100
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,174
l just didn't know
how to make it work.

101
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,045
What does that mean?

102
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,655
That treadmill's not broken.

103
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,917
But if you don't know how to run it,
it ain't gonna work for you.

104
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,822
You saying l need counseling?

105
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,930
Well, l think everybody
needs counseling.

106
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,026
Hey, look, man, l am not about to go
talk to somebody l don't even know...

107
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,466
...about something
that's none of their business.

108
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,630
All right.
Catherine does need to respect you.

109
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,673
But just remember,
a woman's like a rose.

110
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,573
lf you treat her right, she'll bloom.

111
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,839
lf you don't, she'll wilt.

112
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,446
Where'd you get that?

113
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,619
Counseling.

114
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,901
Great.

115
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,803
What are you doing?

116
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,470
l see you left me no pizza.

117
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,910
l just lit that candle.
l like the way it smells.

118
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,709
Well, l don't.
Did you leave me any dinner at all?

119
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,045
l assumed
you were eating with Michael.

120
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,682
Does it not occur to you...

121
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,119
...that two people in this house
both need to eat?

122
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,589
You know what?
lf you would communicate with me...

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,990
...maybe l could
have something for you.

124
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,555
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

125
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,461
Oh, l'm making everything difficult?

126
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,070
l'm carrying the weight around here
while you're off doing your own thing.

127
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,330
Excuse me?

128
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,839
l'm working to pay this mortgage,
and l pay for both of the cars.

129
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,069
Yeah, and that's all you do.
l pay all of our bills with my salary.

130
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,237
Which you agreed to do. That's fair.

131
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,849
Do you not like this house?
Do you not like your car?

132
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,848
Caleb, who takes care
of this house?

133
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,680
Me. Who washes all the clothes?

134
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,321
Me. Who gets all the groceries?

135
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,754
Me. Not to mention l'm helping
my parents every weekend.

136
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,450
l've got all this pressure on me.

137
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,892
The only thing you do for anybody
is for yourself.

138
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,158
Let me tell you, you don't know
the first thing about pressure.

139
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,792
All right? You think
l put out house fires for myself?

140
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,838
Or rush to car wrecks at 2 a.m.
for myself?

141
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,534
Or pull a child's body
out of a lake for myself?

142
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,043
You have no idea what l go through.

143
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,909
Yeah, but what do you do around here
other than watch TV...

144
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,675
...and waste time on the lnternet?

145
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,752
lf looking at that trash
is how you get fulfilled, that's fine.

146
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,388
But l will not compete with it.

147
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,786
Well, l sure don't get it from you.

148
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,951
And you won't.

149
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,823
Because you care more
about saving for your stupid boat...

150
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,023
...and pleasing yourself
than you ever did about me.

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,294
Shut up! l'm sick of you!

152
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,803
You disrespectful, ungrateful,
selfish woman!

153
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,838
-l'm not selfish.
-How dare you say that?

154
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,638
You constantly nag me
and you drain the life out of me!

155
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,746
l'm tired of it!

156
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,905
lf you can't give me
the respect l deserve--

157
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,414
Look at me!

158
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,053
--then what's the point
of this marriage?

159
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,325
l want out.

160
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,022
l just want out.

161
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,563
lf you want out, that's fine with me!

162
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,763
Mr. Rudolph.

163
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,133
Caleb.

164
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,655
-That's it.
-All right.

165
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,483
Think we got it. We're good to go.

166
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,954
l think l got this.

167
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,390
-You think you know the truck?
-Yeah.

168
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,722
All right. l'll tell you what.

169
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,388
We're gonna go inside
and get something to drink.

170
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,591
You bring me a hose stretcher.

171
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,202
All right.

172
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,729
-That's mean, man.
-No, it's good for him.

173
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,205
-Mother's gifts.
-Okay.

174
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,367
-And--
-You know what? l forgot to tell you.

175
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,672
-l got Friday off and l'll be there.
-Good.

176
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,610
You know l ain't gonna
let my son down.

177
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,807
l know you won't.

178
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,179
Hey, we still got
that hot date tomorrow, right?

179
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,911
Oh, so now it's a hot date?

180
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,919
Life's too short
to have any other kind.

181
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,580
You're right.

182
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,727
-l love you, baby.
-l love you too.

183
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,022
-And l will see you in the morning.
-All right.

184
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,961
-Back home.
-All right, see you later.

185
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,537
Eric, what are you doing?

186
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,471
Wayne told me
to grab a hose stretcher.

187
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,044
-A hose stretcher?
-Yes, sir.

188
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,980
Eric, you are the hose stretcher.

189
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,978
Man.

190
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,161
Honey, l agree with you.
You gotta get out.

191
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,455
-He don't deserve you.
-You can say that again.

192
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,862
A real man's gotta be a hero to his wife
before anybody, or he ain't a real man.

193
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,596
Do you need a place to stay? l can't
imagine living in the same house.

194
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,070
No, l decided
that l'm not the one that's leaving.

195
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,369
-He's the problem, not me.
-That's right, girl. Stand your ground.

196
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,806
Make him respect you.

197
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,209
lf there's one thing
a man understands....

198
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,817
lt's respect. That's the issue. That's
the reason our marriage is failing.

199
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,944
She shows me no respect at all.
And the saddest part about it is....

200
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,056
He doesn't have a clue.

201
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,092
He thinks our marriage
has been fine for the most part.

202
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,728
You know, he probably thinks....

203
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,887
Our marriage has been fine
until this year.

204
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,590
Now, all of a sudden,
she goes off the deep end.

205
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,969
Do you think this happened
all of a sudden?

206
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,468
l don't know what to think.
l don't understand her.

207
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,368
She's emotional about everything.

208
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,873
She's easily offended
and way too sensitive.

209
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,535
l mean, he's so insensitive,
you know?

210
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,241
He doesn't truly care how l feel.
He doesn't listen to me.

211
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,614
Even if l say it over
and over and over again.

212
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,881
And then she starts nagging me
and saying l don't listen to her...

213
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,854
...or something like that.

214
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,551
lt drives me crazy.
l feel like l'm going....

215
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,253
lnsane.

216
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,921
You know,
he doesn't understand my needs.

217
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,796
l feel like we are
completely and totally....

218
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,993
lncompatible.

219
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,435
She's probably whining to her friends,
making me sound like a criminal.

220
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,940
l can see them all right now, crying,
having some sort of group hug.

221
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,545
lt's gonna be okay, sweetie.
lt's gonna be all right.

222
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,203
You'll get through this.

223
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,440
We have your back.

224
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,584
Whatever you need.
Whatever you need.

225
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,180
So you think
it's past the point of no return?

226
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,116
l don't have a reason to return.

227
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,594
-Bethany.
-Hey, Kyle. Hey, Ross.

228
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,598
-What's going on?
-What are y'all doing?

229
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,896
We're heading to the pizza barn
to meet friends.

230
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,868
Y'all wanna come?

231
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,701
Sure.

232
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,178
Hey, we'll race you there.
And if you win, we'll buy.

233
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,974
Ready, set....

234
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,173
Go, go, go.

235
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,818
Hey, Dad.

236
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,396
No, not really.

237
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,092
l think Catherine and l are done.

238
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,730
No, it's over.

239
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,540
She said she wants out.

240
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,979
Sure, yeah, you can come over
tomorrow. l'll be home.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,981
Dad, l gotta go.

242
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,956
Public Safety
to Engine 1 , Battalion 1 .

243
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,152
Respond to the intersection of
Roosevelt and Kelley, 1 0-50-l rescue.

244
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,559
<i>-Time out, 1 2:2 1.
-Hey, that's close by.</i>

245
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,758
Lieutenant, you and Terrell
take the other truck and go with us.

246
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,271
Okay, let's roll.

247
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,860
Engine 1 is en route
to Roosevelt and Kelley, 1 0-50 rescue.

248
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,657
<i>1 0-4, Engine 1.</i>

249
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,267
Lieutenant, you and Sanders have
the Hurst tools ready if we need them.

250
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,432
-You stay with me when we pull up.
-Yes, sir.

251
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,368
We've already got a crowd.

252
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,533
-Can you see it?
-We've got one car on the tracks.

253
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,803
You're kidding me.

254
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,439
Oh, it doesn't look good.

255
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,939
Engine 1 , it's 1 0-23.

256
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,879
We have a two-vehicle accident
with possible entrapment.

257
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,316
One of the vehicles
is on the train tracks.

258
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,820
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

259
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,551
<i>Ten-four, Command.
Be advised, EMS is en route.</i>

260
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,996
-Rookie, you come with me.
-Yes, sir. Let's go, guys.

261
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,523
You two go check out the car.
Let me know what you got.

262
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,895
l need
an inch-and-three-quarter line.

263
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,097
Harmon,
you check out the passenger.

264
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,799
All right, l need you all to stay clear
of the tracks and the vehicle.

265
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,875
l'm Captain Holt
from the Fire Department.

266
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,569
-We're here to help.
-Help me, please. l can't get out.

267
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,806

-My legs are hurting.

268
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,213
-Please, please help me.
-All right, we're gonna help you.

269
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,584
Okay. Where else are you hurting?

270
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,418
My neck is hurting.
Please, please help.

You're gonna be fine.

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,694
-You're gonna be all right.
-Captain.

275
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,268
-She's alive but not responding.
-Get the spreaders.

276
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,769
Those two will be okay.
They've got minor injuries.

277
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,272
We have to cut these two out.
Sanders, help Harmon.

278
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,535
-l need you to check for gas leaks.
-Yes, sir.

279
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,110
We've got an ambulance coming.

280
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,247
-l'm gonna stay right here with you.
-Okay.

281
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,042
You're gonna hear
a very loud noise.

282
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,777
That just means
we're getting you out faster.

283
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,387
-All right. You're gonna be all right.
-Okay.

284
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,649
-Captain, did l just hear a train?
-Guys, there's a train coming.

285
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,025
Dispatcher,
this is Roosevelt Command.

286
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,788
We have a car on the train tracks.

287
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,866
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

288
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,035
<i>Roosevelt Command, be advised...</i>

289
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,502
<i>...we are currently unable to make
contact with the train dispatcher.</i>

290
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,197
No, no, no. We don't have time.

291
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,141
Come on, we're gonna have to push it
out of the way. Let's go, let's go.

292
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,177
No, l don't wanna die.
l don't wanna die.

293
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,181
All right, let's go. Push. Push.

294
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,750
Captain, it's not rolling.
We gotta drag it off.

295
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,449
-Get the chain.
-Hey, Wayne, hook up the chain.

296
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,527
Hook up the chain.

297
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,161
Hey, there's a train!

298
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,495
-Captain, we gotta pick this up.
-All right, grab the front.

299
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,400
Lift on three. One, two, three.

300
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,740
Again. One, two, three.

301
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,782
Again. Let's go.
We're getting this car off the tracks.

302
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,119
One, two, three.

303
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,350
Again. One, two, three.

304
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,294
-Again, captain.
-One, two, three.

305
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,798
One, two, three.

306
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,450
Harmon, go back
and get the spreaders.

307
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,782
Medic!

308
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,489
-You all right?
-Come on, let's go.

309
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,331
You'll be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

310
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,167
Thank you, Lord.

311
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,872
Thank you, God.

312
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,147
Thank you, God.

313
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,051
Are you okay?

314
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,623
Captain, l just needed a minute.

315
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,738
Well, l broke my record of how close
l could come to death and still live.

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,572
Well, don't break it next time.

317
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,707
l wasn't trying to break it this time.

318
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,582
Hey.

319
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,016
Don't tell my wife.

320
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,685
-Hey, lieutenant?
-Yeah?

321
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,281
This kind of thing doesn't happen
all the time, does it?

322
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,823
Risking our lives? Yes.

323
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,018
Playing chicken with a train?
First time.

324
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,557
-Aren't you afraid of dying?
-No.

325
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,500
Because l know where l'm going.

326
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,466
l just don't wanna get there
because l got hit by a train.

327
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,672
Why don't you come
help me work on some dinner?

328
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,842
All right.

329
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,048
Hey, captain, hold on for a second.

330
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,618
You know where you're going?

331
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,053
-l'm going to my office.
-No.

332
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,783
You believe in heaven and hell?

333
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,059
l don't know.

334
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,961
When l die, l'm going in the ground.
That's where l'm staying.

335
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,592
You know, you and Michael both seem
so sure, but one of you is wrong.

336
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,602
lt ain't me.

337
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,400
How do you know?

338
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,503
Hey, listen,
you might not agree with Michael...

339
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,168
...but you and l both know
he's the real deal.

340
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,618
Son, how long has this
been going on?

341
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,450
l don't know, Dad. We've had
our arguments now and then...

342
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,650
...but it seems like now
she is constantly frustrated with me.

343
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,523
l mean, l walk in the door
and she's mad about something.

344
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,425
Have you given her
reason to be upset?

345
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,691
l've never known Catherine
to be unreasonable.

346
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,495
l could have saved the lives
of two people at work...

347
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,935
...and if l'm not here helping wash
the dishes, l'm a horrible husband.

348
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,234
But, Caleb,
she needs your help here as well.

349
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,639
Doesn't she help her parents out
every week?

350
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,373
-She can't do everything around here.
-You sound like you're taking her side.

351
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,346
But she's working and she's trying--

352
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,315
Mom, l do not need you to tell me
l'm doing everything wrong.

353
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,456
l've got Catherine for that.
l am not the problem, she is.

354
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,252
-All l'm saying is, if she's working--
-Cheryl, let's hear Caleb out.

355
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,395
l wanna know
what's going on with him.

356
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:29,967
Dad, can l please have a few minutes
to talk with you, alone?

357
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,569
Caleb, l just wanna help
you and Catherine.

358
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,671
-Dad.
-Honey.

359
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,738
Why don't you let us take a walk?
lt's all right.

360
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,241
Okay.

361
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,186
Dad, why did you have to bring her?

362
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,015
Caleb, because she's my wife.

363
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,852
And your mother,
no one loves you more than her.

364
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,460
She just-- She's always fixing me.

365
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,723
She's still trying to fix me.
l'm not broken.

366
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,359
Son, if you're looking
for a perfect mother...

367
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,828
...l'm afraid
there's not one out there.

368
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,564
But she's a good woman.

369
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,732
And l love her now
more than l ever have.

370
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,277
l'm not saying l don't love her, Dad.
Just that she--

371
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,778
She grates on me.

372
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,080
Have you not seen a change in her
in the last two years?

373
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,884
Yeah, she treats you better.

374
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,047
But you've also put up with a lot
over the years.

375
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,550
Well, so has she.

376
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,822
Dad, l'm glad you didn't split up...

377
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,397
...but l would have understood
if you had.

378
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,557
Do you know why we didn't?

379
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,160
Not really. She realized
she couldn't do any better?

380
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,829
Not quite.

381
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,375
Caleb, the Lord did a work in us.

382
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,570
ln both of us.

383
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,677
The Lord?

384
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,213
-You're giving credit to God?
-Why does that bother you?

385
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,651
You've always believed in God.

386
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,391
lf there's a God out there, he's not
interested in me and my problems.

387
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,258
l disagree.
l'd say he's very interested.

388
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,898
Then where's he been in my life?

389
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,035
He's been at work all around you.
You just haven't realized it.

390
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,694
You haven't exactly
given him an open invitation.

391
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,570
What is this place?

392
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,646
Used to be a summer camp
across the lake.

393
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,284
l think this must be a part of it.

394
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,480
Son, l used to be
where you are right now.

395
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,652
God didn't matter to me.

396
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,853
But l can't say that anymore.

397
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,498
l never understood why Jesus
had to die on the cross--

398
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,099
Dad, please.

399
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,463
We had this conversation
last month.

400
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,300
l'm glad this new faith is working
for you and Mom, l really am.

401
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,066
lt's just....

402
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,311
lt's not for me.

403
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,449
Caleb...

404
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,513
...is there anything in you
that wants to save your marriage?

405
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,650
Maybe. lf Catherine wanted to,
but she doesn't. She wants divorce.

406
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,357
ls that what you want?

407
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,087
l want peace.

408
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,891
But what difference does it make?

409
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,330
She signs the papers, Dad,
it's all over.

410
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,001
Have you agreed
to start the process with her?

411
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,171
No, but l think we both understand
where this is all headed.

412
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,777
l've got plans
to meet with my lawyer tomorrow.

413
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,346
Caleb, l want you
to do something for me.

414
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,539
What?

415
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,848
l want you to hold off on the divorce
for 40 days.

416
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,545
Why?

417
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,084
l'm gonna send you
something in the mail.

418
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,685
Something that'll take you
that long to do.

419
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,830
-What is it?
-lt's what saved our marriage.

420
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,398
Dad, if this is a religious thing,
l'd rather you didn't.

421
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,597
Look at it as a gift from your father.

422
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,835
Take one day at a time,
then see what happens.

423
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:06,348
Please, son.
lf for no other reason, do it for me.

424
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,611
l'm asking as your father.

425
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,892
-Forty days?
-Forty days.

426
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,732
-Eating alone?
-Well, hello, Dr. Keller.

427
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,401
-Gavin.
-Gavin, sorry.

428
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,978
-How are you?
-l'm doing well.

429
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,138
l just need a place
to put my plate down.

430
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,749
ls this spot reserved?

431
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,785
Deidra was supposed to meet me,
but you're welcome to join us.

432
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,048
Well, if you're gonna twist my arm,
l don't want any trouble.

433
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,261
Are you gonna eat
wearing your clean white coat?

434
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,399
l need to keep up
with the latest fashions.

435
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,127
lt seems all the doctors
are wearing one these days.

436
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,794
But it's probably not too smart
while l'm eating.

437
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,139
l didn't know
doctors cared about fashion.

438
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,469
We keep up
with the attractive fashions...

439
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,873
...the Public Relations
employees wear.

440
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,513
l see.

441
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,945
Since there's
only one person in that category...

442
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,584
...l'm sure she'd feel honored.

443
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,118
She should. She's pretty amazing.

444
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,629
Hey, you look good.

445
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,109
Thanks. l try to take care of myself.

446
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,371
You like this song?

447
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,473
Oh, yeah.

448
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,549
You feel that?

449
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,179
lt's called chemistry, and we got it.

450
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,055
Wayne won't leave you.

451
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:07,262
-Hey, man, you seen my bag in here?
-No, l ain't seen it.

452
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,668
All right. lt's probably in my locker.

453
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,778
Where were we?

454
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,820
Oh, come on. That ain't funny.

455
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,086
This ain't no show.

456
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,494
This is me-time.

457
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,226
Terrell!

458
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,326
Wayne.

459
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,899
Forty days? Does Catherine know?

460
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,671
l'm not gonna tell her.

461
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,643
lf she wants to go ahead and file,
that's up to her.

462
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,412
Divorce is a hard thing, man.

463
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,215
Well, if it brings peace....

464
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,843
But, Caleb,
you want the right kind of peace.

465
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,182
What do you mean by that?

466
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,655
You know what that ring
on your finger means?

467
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,385
-Means l'm married.
-Yeah.

468
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,587
lt also means
you made a lifelong covenant.

469
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,528
You putting on that ring
while saying your vows.

470
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,963
The sad part about it is...

471
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,399
...when most people promise
for better or worse...

472
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,596
...they really only mean
for the better.

473
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,811
Catherine and l were in love
when we got married, but today...

474
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,209
...we're two very different people,
all right?

475
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,645
lt's just not working out anymore.

476
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,716
Caleb, salt and pepper
are completely different.

477
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,760
Their makeup is different,
their taste and their color.

478
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,828
But you always see them together.

479
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,055
And when you....

480
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,328
Hold on just a second.

481
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,000
What are you doing?

482
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,013
Michael. Hey.

483
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,247
What'd you do that for?

484
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:10,754
Caleb, when two people get married,
it's for better or for worse.

485
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,829
For richer or for poorer.

486
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,124
ln sickness and in health.

487
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,325
l know that.

488
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,198
But marriages aren't fireproof.
Sometimes, you get burned.

489
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,167
Fireproof doesn't mean
that a fire will never come...

490
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,369
...but that when it comes,
you'll be able to withstand it.

491
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,273
-You didn't have to glue them.
-Don't do it, Caleb.

492
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,613
lf you pull them apart now,
you'll break either one or both of them.

493
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,616
l am not a perfect person,
but better than most.

494
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,659
And if my marriage is failing,
it is not all my fault.

495
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,388
But, Caleb, l've seen you
run into a burning building...

496
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,623
...to save people
you don't even know.

497
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,065
But you're gonna let your own
marriage just burn to the ground.

498
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,398
Michael, you are my friend.

499
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,600
And l have allowed you
to speak freely with me on this job.

500
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,835
Don't abuse it.

501
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,584
<i>My son, this 40-day journey
cannot be taken lightly.</i>

502
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,696
<i>It is a challenging
and often difficult process...</i>

503
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,957
<i>...but an incredibly fulfilling one.</i>

504
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,068
<i>If you will commit
to a day at a time for 40 days...</i>

505
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,694
<i>...the results could change your life
and your marriage.</i>

506
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:06,037
<i>Consider it a dare from others
who have done it before you.</i>

507
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,545
<i>Day one: The first part of this dare
is fairly simple.</i>

508
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,206
<i>Although love is communicated
in a number of ways...</i>

509
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,478
<i>...our words often reflect
the condition of our heart.</i>

510
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,678
<i>For the next day...</i>

511
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,722
<i>...resolve to say nothing negative
to your spouse at all.</i>

512
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,861
<i>If the temptation arises,
choose not to say anything.</i>

513
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,191
<i>It's better to hold your tongue
than to say something you'll regret.</i>

514
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,267
<i>Be quick to listen,
slow to speak and slow to get angry.</i>

515
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,631
<i>James 1: 1 9.</i>

516
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,112
Would you have time
to take that to the dry-cleaners today?

517
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,925
Think after two days off, you would
have already taken care of that.

518
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,197
<i>Day two:</i>

519
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:14,606
<i>It is difficult to demonstrate love
when you feel little to no motivation.</i>

520
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,112
<i>But love in its truest sense
is not based on feelings...</i>

521
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,944
<i>...but a determination
to show thoughtful actions...</i>

522
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,451
<i>...even when there seems
to be no reward.</i>

523
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,488
<i>In addition to saying nothing negative
to your spouse today...</i>

524
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:32,289
<i>...do at least one unexpected gesture
as an act of kindness.</i>

525
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,282
l poured your coffee.

526
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,550
l don't have time for coffee.

527
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,239
<i>Day three:</i>

528
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,147
<i>Whatever you put your time,
energy and money into...</i>

529
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,151
<i>...will become
more important to you.</i>

530
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,155
<i>It's hard to care
for something you're not investing in.</i>

531
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,385
<i>Along with refraining
from any negative comments...</i>

532
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,430
<i>...buy your wife something that says
you were thinking of her today.</i>

533
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,902
Yeah, l need to order some flowers
or something for my wife.

534
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,231
No. No, it doesn't matter.

535
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,440
Sure. How much does that cost?

536
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,602
Forty-five?
Do you have something cheaper?

537
00:36:56,347 --> 00:37:00,078
Yeah, yeah, that's more like it.
Let's go with the 25.

538
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,981
How about a box of chocolates
or something?

539
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,746
How much is that?

540
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,621
You're killing me.

541
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,088
That's better.

542
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,855
Okay, how about
a little stuffed bear?

543
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,895
All right, forget the bear.

544
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,427
How long is it gonna take you
to throw something like that together?

545
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,217
Man, you done lost your mind.

546
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,324
Terrell, l can bench 300 right now.

547
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,516
For real?

548
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,127
Why can't we all come
to the same obvious conclusion?

549
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,786
That l am the man.

550
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,491
All l know is the man
left the thermal-imaging device...

551
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,795
...on the bumper of the truck
last night.

552
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,871
-That's an $8000 piece of equipment.
-My bad, captain.

553
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,507
That doesn't change the fact...

554
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,303
...when it comes to difficult situations,
l can take it.

555
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,968
Man, l can't take this much ego.

556
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,671
You've been bragging on yourself
for 1 0 minutes, man.

557
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,407
lt ain't bragging if it's true.

558
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,576
Last week at the apartment fire,
l pulled off two attack lines...

559
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,689
...laid my own supply line
and caught a hydrant in two minutes.

560
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,621
-Other folks could do that, man.
-Not from this station.

561
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,852
-Tom McBride could.
-At Station 4?

562
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,021
He might do it in two and a half,
but he can't do it under two.

563
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,794
-l don't know.
-Captain...

564
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,299
...he's strong, but he's not as fast.

565
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,494
l could take him
any day of the week.

566
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,897
Wayne, you seem
pretty high on yourself.

567
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,670
l think confidence is a good thing,
but you're over the top.

568
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,244
Man, he way over the top.

569
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,314
l can back it up.
That's all l'm saying.

570
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,374
Wrath of God, baby.

571
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,679
-What's that for?
-We're about to have a little contest.

572
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,482
We're just gonna see
if Wayne really is the man.

573
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,522
That is, if he's for the challenge.

574
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,923
l'm all about this.

575
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,795
All right.

576
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,556
l'll go first.

577
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,758
-What are you gonna do?
-Michael, time me.

578
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,130
You got it. Ready?

579
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,635
Go.

580
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,368
No way.

581
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,705
Man, you crazy.

582
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,279
He gonna drink the whole thing.

583
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,421
Twenty-three seconds.

584
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,598
All right, man. You're up.

585
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,566
All right. That was impressive.

586
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,933
Till l do it under 20.

587
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,633
-Time me.
-Oh, l'll time you.

588
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,668
-Ready?
-Ladies.

589
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,210
Go.

590
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,979
-Come on, Wayne.
-lt's hot.

591
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,177
-Go, Wayne.
-That's it, Wayne.

592
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,083
How about you take it?

593
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,286
-You gotta drink that, bro.
-Fourteen seconds.

594
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,292
-Come on.
-lt burns!

595
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,425
Where the man at now, huh?

596
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,069
l thought he said he could take it.

597
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,969
My mouth's on fire!

598
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,572
Captain, how'd you do that, man?

599
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,268
You could do it too, Terrell...

600
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,108
...if you replaced yours
with tomato juice.

601
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,286
That is classic. That was awesome.

602
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,023
Dr. Anderson?

603
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,752
Wanted to remind you
about your interview in 1 0 minutes.

604
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,725
Catherine, thank you. l'll be there.

605
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,990
Congratulations
on your cancer-research award.

606
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,033
-You deserve it.
-l appreciate that.

607
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,430
This is Catherine.

608
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,061
Hey, it's Caleb.
l wanted to call and check on you.

609
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,102
You wanted to check on me?
What for?

610
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,574
You know,
just see if you needed anything.

611
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,309
You called to see
if l needed anything?

612
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,852
<i>Right, yeah. You want me
to bring something home for you...</i>

613
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,855
<i>...or get something from the store
in the morning?</i>

614
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:04,426
Caleb, you never asked me this
before. What's going on?

615
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,655
l just wanted to see
if you needed anything, that's it.

616
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,527
<i>I'm fine.</i>

617
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,691
Okay.

618
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,394
All right, well...

619
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,062
...goodbye.

620
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,776
Day four, done.

621
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,119
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

622
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,120
Confused.

623
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,555
-My husband's acting weird.
-What's he doing?

624
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,587
Well, in the last few days...

625
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:46,964
...he has fixed me coffee,
bought me these pitiful little flowers...

626
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,402
...and just now,
called just to see if l'm doing okay.

627
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,876
-Really?
-Yeah.

628
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,442
l'll tell you what he's doing.

629
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,910
He's trying to butter you up
for a divorce.

630
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,412
And why would he do that?

631
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,447
Before my cousin Luwanna
got a divorce...

632
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,210
...her husband did the same thing.

633
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,911
He started acting nice and sweet,
next thing we know...

634
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,649
...he walks away with the house
and most of their money.

635
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,727
He hasn't even talked to her since.
Don't you let him deceive you, girl.

636
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,882
Did you clear your history?

637
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,388
What?

638
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,088
Did you wipe the websites off so
nobody would see where you've been?

639
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,934
You know, Caleb,
you're not fooling anybody.

640
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,697
l know what you're trying to do...

641
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,638
...buying me flowers
and calling me at work.

642
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,902
And what is that?

643
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,775
l'm meeting with a lawyer next week,
and don't you think...

644
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,440
...l'm buying into
this nice-guy routine.

645
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,779
What are you talking about?

646
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,252
You're not getting one dime
more than you deserve.

647
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,120
When this divorce is final,
l'm taking my share.

648
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,854
-ls that what you think l'm doing?
-No, l know that's what you're doing.

649
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,122
Well, you're wrong.

650
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,267
You never assume l would do anything
worthy of respect.

651
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,130
-Anything honorable.
-Honorable?

652
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,862
Honorable?
What were you just looking at, Caleb?

653
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,167
What was on that computer screen?
Was that honorable?

654
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,810
Who do you think you're fooling?

655
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,845
Do you know why your sweet
little gestures mean nothing to me?

656
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,278
lt's because that's the kind of man
you've become.

657
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,543
When you're alone,
that's what you default to.

658
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,119
And there is nothing honorable
about it.

659
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,411
Mr. Rudolph.

660
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,945
Caleb.

661
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,798
-Hello?
-lt's not working, Dad.

662
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,030
<i>What's not working?</i>

663
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,572
This whole love dare thing.
lt is not working.

664
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,834
Tell me what's going on.

665
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,776
l have been doing everything
that it says to do...

666
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,381
...and she has completely rejected
all of it.

667
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,882
Caleb, this process takes 40 days,
not four.

668
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,317
<i>What's the point of going down
a dead-end road...</i>

669
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,423
<i>-...when it's not going anywhere?
-You don't know that yet.</i>

670
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,922
<i>Caleb, you're not a quitter.</i>

671
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:00,189
And something tells me
you're doing just enough to get by.

672
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,564
Am l right?

673
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,432
-l feel nothing.
-l understand, son.

674
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,076
<i>But this is not based on feelings.</i>

675
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,541
<i>It's a decision.</i>

676
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,840
You can't give up yet.

677
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,108
Keep taking a day at a time.

678
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,411
Yes, sir.

679
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,950
l love you, son.

680
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,720
You too, Dad.

681
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,063
How is he?

682
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,500
We've gotta start
praying for him more.

683
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,239
Mama, l don't know what to do.

684
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,942
l know you always told me to hang on
during the hard times, but....

685
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,680
You don't know
what l've been competing with.

686
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,690
l mean, when he look....

687
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,532
He makes me feel so humiliated.

688
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,866
And he doesn't even know it.

689
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,605
When did l stop
being good enough for him?

690
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,956
So, what day are you on?

691
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,090
-Eighteen.
-And?

692
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,094
And it's still difficult.

693
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,923
Every day has me adding
a new concept to the way l treat her.

694
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,591
For example?

695
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,396
Well, here.

696
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,699
Day 1 6 was about praying for her.
l kind of skipped that one.

697
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,638
Day 1 7 is about listening to her.

698
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,076
Eighteen's about
studying her again.

699
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,242
-Studying her?
-Yeah.

700
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,917
Here.

701
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,712
''When a man is trying to win the heart
of a woman, he studies her.

702
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,449
He learns her likes, dislikes,
habits and hobbies.

703
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,855
But after he wins her heart
and marries her...

704
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,222
...he often stops learning about her.

705
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,523
lf the amount he studied her
before marriage...

706
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,929
...was equal to a high school degree,
he should continue to learn...

707
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,128
...until he gains a college degree,
a master's degree...

708
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,330
...and ultimately, a doctorate degree.

709
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:35,035
lt is a lifelong journey that draws
his heart ever closer to hers.''

710
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,272
That's a pretty good concept.
l never thought about it like that.

711
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,247
So do you study Tina?

712
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,115
Yeah, but l don't think
l got my college degree on her yet.

713
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,788
So tell me a little bit more
about the studying her.

714
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,895
l'm supposed to make her
a candlelight dinner...

715
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,327
...and then ask her
a whole list of questions.

716
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,823
Well, my advice is go all out.

717
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,592
Meaning?

718
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,762
Don't go cheap. lf you don't cook,
get it from a good restaurant.

719
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,309
Take it home, use your best dishes,
glasses, music, everything.

720
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,342
Make it a memorable date.

721
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:13,946
Man, what you talking about?

722
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,280
-You ain't had a date in a year.
-l'm like a fine wine.

723
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,752
l need about 35 years
to reach perfection.

724
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:23,381
But the lady that gets Wayne Floyd,
she'll get the complete package.

725
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,653
-You mean complete wreckage.
-No.

726
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,825
l'm 255 pounds of pure love.

727
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,934
All you need to make marriage work
is a little bit of romance.

728
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,797
And that comes from right here.

729
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,031
Man, that's easy to say
when you ain't never been married.

730
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,799
lt's a lot harder than you think.

731
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,672
One day l'm gonna walk in
with a tanned beauty on my arm.

732
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,506
l'll show you how easy it can be.

733
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,376
The only thing you'll come in with
hanging from your arm...

734
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,643
...is a bucket of chicken.

735
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,949
lt was tomato juice.

736
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,097
Tomato juice? Man, that's wrong!

737
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,898
-That's wrong.
-What's wrong?

738
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,337
l drank the real stuff
and he drank tomato juice?

739
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,635
You just got that?

740
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,539
Do you know
what that stuff did to me?

741
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,077
Go to bed, Wayne.

742
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,705
-There's some serious repercussions.
-Quiet.

743
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,909
Oh, it's on now.

744
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,084
Done lit a fuse.

745
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,748
Somebody's gonna get
a karate-chop sandwich.

746
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:45,994
What are you doing?

747
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,706
Maybe l'd like to have dinner
with my wife.

748
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,674
Let me be real clear with you
about something.

749
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,314
l do not love you.

750
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,765
Oh, son.

751
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,961
This is when it gets hard.

752
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,707
-Hello, Caleb.
-We're done, Dad.

753
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:03,972
l am not gonna keep doing this.
l have tried and there's nothing there.

754
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,375
lt's not worth it.

755
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,915
l understand, son,
but you're halfway there...

756
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,075
...which was the most difficult
for us too.

757
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,222
But at least you had some hope.
She has given me nothing.

758
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,915
There was a point
when we had no hope either.

759
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,185
Our marriage should have ended,
Caleb.

760
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,727
You can't listen to the way you feel
at the moment.

761
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,125
<i>She's seen you trying.</i>

762
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:26,827
No, she doesn't care, Dad.
None of this means anything to her.

763
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,493
Dad, l tried.

764
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,504
Caleb, are you off tomorrow?

765
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,499
Yeah, why?

766
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,535
l'm coming to see you.
We can talk then.

767
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,542
Dad, you don't have to do that.

768
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,109
l want to, son. l'd like to come.

769
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,087
All right.

770
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,317
Dad, l gotta be honest with you.

771
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,921
l feel bad that you drove four hours
just to come see me.

772
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,684
lt was good.
lt gave me time to think and pray.

773
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,657
So, what are you on, Day 20?

774
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,764
-Yeah, yeah, something like that.
-Yeah.

775
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,298
l'd say the halfway point
was the hardest for us.

776
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,359
Why?

777
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:37,302
Well, it's when you determine
whether your heart's in it or not.

778
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,966
Makes you check your real motives
when things get difficult.

779
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,470
Yeah?
Did Mom give you a hard time?

780
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:47,481
No. l thought your mother
had a pretty good attitude about it.

781
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,051
Yeah, well,
Catherine's not buying any of it.

782
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,780
-Why do you think that is?
-Because she doesn't love me.

783
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,218
She doesn't even like me.

784
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,122
Dad, she's just about ignored
everything l've done.

785
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,025
Are you reading everything
on each page?

786
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,963
You mean the Bible verses
at the bottom of it?

787
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,864
No, l'm not, Dad.

788
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,632
-l told you, that is not what l need.
-And what do you need?

789
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:15,335
l need Catherine to wake up to the fact
that we are about to get a divorce.

790
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,845
And l'm trying to prevent that,
but l cannot do it by myself.

791
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,849
That may be true,
but l think you need more than that.

792
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,747
Dad, if you're gonna tell me
l need Jesus, please don't.

793
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,255
l don't need a crutch
to get through life.

794
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,587
Oh, son,
Jesus is much more than a crutch.

795
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,958
He's become the most significant part
of our lives.

796
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,655
Dad, why do you keep saying that?

797
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,064
He's the most significant part?
How is that?

798
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:45,173
When l realized who l was
and who he was...

799
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,333
...l realized my need for him.

800
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,775
l needed his forgiveness
and salvation.

801
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,210
See, l don't understand that.

802
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:58,184
Why do l need his salvation?
What, am l gonna be thrown into hell?

803
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,586
For what? Because l got divorced?

804
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,282
No.

805
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,860
Because you violated his standards.

806
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,554
What? Thou shall not kill?

807
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,996
Dad, l help people.
l am a good person.

808
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,634
According to you.

809
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,362
But God doesn't judge
by your standards.

810
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,733
-He uses his.
-And what are his?

811
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,068
Well, truth.

812
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,267
-Okay.
-Love.

813
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,105
-l'm honest.
-Faithfulness.

814
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,747
l care about people.
l am those things.

815
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,348
Sometimes.

816
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,420
But have you loved God,
the one who gave you life?

817
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:38,027
His standards are so high,
he considers hatred to be murder...

818
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:42,221
...and lust to be adultery.

819
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,061
Dad, what about
all the good l've done?

820
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,766
Son, saving someone from a fire
does not make you right with God.

821
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,240
You've broken his commandments.

822
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,006
And one day,
you'll answer to him for that.

823
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,954
Caleb...

824
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,786
...if l ask you why
you're so frustrated with Catherine...

825
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,621
...what would you say?

826
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,563
She's stubborn.

827
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,431
She makes everything
difficult for me.

828
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,265
She's ungrateful.

829
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,102
She's constantly griping
about something.

830
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,608
Has she thanked you
the last 20 days?

831
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,075
No.

832
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,111
And you'd think
after l washed the car...

833
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,944
...l've changed the oil,
do the dishes, clean the house...

834
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,417
...that she would try to show me
a little bit of gratitude.

835
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,249
Well, she doesn't.

836
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:44,359
ln fact, when l come home,
she makes me feel like l'm an enemy.

837
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,427
l'm not even welcome
in my own home, Dad.

838
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,860
That is what really ticks me off.

839
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,195
Dad, for the last three weeks,
l have bent over backwards for her.

840
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:56,134
l have tried to demonstrate
that l still care about this relationship.

841
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,002
l bought her flowers,
which she threw away.

842
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,975
l have taken her insults
and her sarcasm, but last night was it.

843
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,741
l made dinner for her, l did
everything l could to demonstrate...

844
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,544
...that l care about her,
to show value for her...

845
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,380
...and she spat in my face.

846
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,081
She does not deserve this, Dad.
l am not doing it anymore.

847
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:19,661
How am l supposed to show love
to somebody over and over and over...

848
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,127
...who constantly rejects me?

849
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,135
That's a good question.

850
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,073
Dad, that is not what l'm doing.

851
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,745
lsn't it?

852
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,711
No--

853
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,650
Dad, that is not what this is about.

854
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,052
Son, you just asked me:

855
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,488
''How can someone show love
over and over again...

856
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,254
...when they're constantly rejected?''

857
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,791
Caleb, the answer is:

858
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,489
You can't love her...

859
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,693
...because you can't give her
what you don't have.

860
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,207
l couldn't truly love your mother
till l understood what love really was.

861
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,737
lt's not because
l get some reward out of it.

862
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,077
l've now made a decision
to love your mother...

863
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,515
...whether she deserves it or not.

864
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:22,756
Son, God loves you
even though you don't deserve it.

865
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,884
Even though you've rejected him.

866
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,091
Spat in his face.

867
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:35,002
God sent Jesus to die on the cross
and take the punishment for your sin...

868
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,597
...because he loves you.

869
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,605
The cross was offensive to me
until l came to it.

870
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,938
But when l did...

871
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,713
...Jesus Christ changed my life.

872
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,983
That's when l truly began
to love your mom.

873
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,820
Son, l can't settle this for you.

874
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,486
This is between you and the Lord.

875
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:05,259
But l love you too much
not to tell you the truth.

876
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,838
Can't you see that you need him?

877
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:19,575
Can't you see
that you need his forgiveness?

878
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,312
Yes.

879
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,484
Will you trust him with your life?

880
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,991
Waffle time.

881
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,926
Hey, man,
l'd like to talk to you about something.

882
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,755
What's that?

883
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,090
-Well--
-Hey, captain.

884
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,662
l think B shift
is trying to pull a joke on us, man.

885
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,666
Salt and pepper shaker
won't come apart.

886
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,634
Hey, toss them over here.

887
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,834
Thanks. Don't forget
to mop the kitchen after breakfast.

888
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,409
Yes, sir.

889
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,081
You wanna tell me something?

890
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,548
lt's about your faith.

891
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,951
-My faith?
-Yeah.

892
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,715
What about it?

893
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,288
Well, l'm in.

894
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,759
You're in?

895
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,024
Yeah, l'm in.

896
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,698
Are you saying
that you wanna be in?

897
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,929
-l'm saying l'm in.
-You're really in?

898
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,370
-Really.
-You can't be half in and say you're in.

899
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,670
-You gotta be all in, brother.
-l'm saying l'm all in.

900
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,437
Caleb, l can't believe it, man.

901
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,638
-Yeah.
-You're my brother.

902
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,147
-l'm your brother?
-Yeah, man.

903
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:05,117
You're my brother from another mother
but now we got the same father.

904
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,188
-What?
-l'll explain it to you later, man.

905
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,789
This is awesome.

906
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,153
-Does Catherine know?
-No.

907
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,421
No, l don't think she'd care right now,
to tell you the truth.

908
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,964
She hasn't been taking too well
to this whole love dare thing.

909
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,967
-But you're not done yet, right?
-No, l'm day 2 1 out of 40.

910
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,805
But l'll be honest with you.
Up to this point...

911
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,635
-...my heart's not been in it.
-That's what matters.

912
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,607
A woman can tell when you're
just going through the motions.

913
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,906
That's absolutely right.

914
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,743
-Hey, let me ask you a question.
-Go ahead.

915
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,449
How did you get a good start
with Tina?

916
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,178
Why is it so easy for you?

917
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:42,324
Oh, it's not always been easy.
Marriage takes work, man.

918
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,621
Tina is an incredible wife.

919
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,854
But we learned a lot of lessons
the hard way.

920
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,032
At least you haven't
had to face divorce.

921
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,097
l wish that were true.

922
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,075
What does that mean?

923
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,144
You and Tina
been struggling that much?

924
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:08,078
Not me and Tina.
But l did with my first wife.

925
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,813
What?

926
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,724
You were married to someone
before Tina?

927
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,851
For one horrible year.

928
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,826
l got married for the wrong reasons.

929
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,126
Then l turned around and got
a divorce for the wrong reasons.

930
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,437
Man, l thought
l was just following my heart.

931
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,397
Michael, l've worked with you
for five years.

932
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,407
-You've never told me that.
-Because l'm not proud of it.

933
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,371
lt was before l gave my life
to the Lord...

934
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,005
...and, man, l was just only concerned
about my rights and my needs.

935
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,379
Man, l ruined her life.

936
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,681
But when l gave my life to God...

937
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,450
...l tried to find her,
but she'd already remarried.

938
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:53,061
So believe me when l tell you
l got a big scar.

939
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,198
Man, God made marriage
to be for life.

940
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:01,000
That's why you gotta keep your vows
to Catherine.

941
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,662
You gotta beg God to teach you
how to be a good husband.

942
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,402
And don't just follow your heart, man,
because your heart can be deceived.

943
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,746
But you gotta lead your heart.

944
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,821
lt's just been hard for me, you know?

945
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,890
l saw my parents again yesterday...

946
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,787
...and, well,
Mom's not doing too well.

947
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:31,557
lt's amazing how much a stroke
can affect somebody's life.

948
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,224
l just....

949
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,768
l feel like she's trapped, you know?

950
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,906
And Dad does his best
to communicate...

951
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,474
...but it's hard for him too.

952
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,106
Catherine, l'm so sorry.

953
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,809
You seem very close to them.

954
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,075
l am.

955
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:52,317
They had me late in life so it was like
growing up with grandparents.

956
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,750
So they spoiled you.

957
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,221
Hey, now.
l think they did a pretty good job.

958
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,718
They did.
They should be very proud.

959
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,930
You know, you're kind of sweet
when you wanna be.

960
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,862
Kind of?

961
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,696
With some training,
l think you could be a fine gentleman.

962
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,337
Well, are you offering lessons?

963
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,268
So, what does your mom need?

964
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,609
Well, a better wheelchair
and hospital bed...

965
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,806
...would be at the top of the list.

966
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:24,441
l've been working with
RMS Medical Supplies to get them...

967
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,848
...but it's so expensive.

968
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,256
Well, you can't put a price
on helping your mom.

969
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,120
That's right.

970
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:34,194
So it's worth the sacrifice.

971
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,991
You know, they're lucky
to have you for a daughter.

972
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,967
Don't look at me like that.
l'm trying to help.

973
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,766
Why does it matter
what my bed looks like? l sleep in it.

974
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,843
What if the chief walks through here?
My bed says l take my job seriously.

975
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,536
Your bed says your mama didn't
help you make it up.

976
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,545
Teaching a rookie
how to make his bed?

977
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,547
Somebody's got to.

978
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:58,744
That looks as bad as yours did
when l taught you.

979
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,191
<i>Engine 2, Engine 1,

01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,567
-Wayne, let's roll.
-Got it.

984

987
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,720
That means
there's something to this one.

988
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,796
Make sure you're tightened up.

989
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,671
Remember your training.
Stay with your partner.

990
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,241
Yes, sir.

991
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,536
Engine 1 is 1 0-23.

ls everyone out of the house?

999
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,958
My daughter's in the neighbor's
house. This is our home.

1000
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,625
-Please, put that fire out.
-We will, just stay clear.

1001
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,668
-Please, please.
-Oh, no. No.

1002
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,068

1003
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,233
-She went home already.
-You mean she's not at your house?

1004
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,641
No, l was just talking to her
on the phone.

1005
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,713
Lacey!

1006
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,475
-You can't go in there.
-Lacey, no!

1007
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,085
-You can't go in there.
-Let me go. Please let me go.

1008
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,386
My baby!

1009
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,491
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on, guys, let's go.

1010
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,853
Lacey!

1011
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,962
My baby.

1012
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,765
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1013
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,336
Let's go.

1014
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,110
-lt's done.
-Charge.

1015
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,080
Lacey!

1016
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,346
Lacey!

1017
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,787
Lacey!

1018
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,417
Lacey!

1019
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,498
Lacey!

1020
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,492
-Get in there, guys, get in there.
-Lacey.

1021
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:35,202
Lacey! Lacey!

1022
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,506
Come on.
Over here, man. Over here.

1023
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,556
Back out, back out, back out.

1024
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,870
Over here!

1025
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,809
Over here!

1026
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,213
There's a hydrant over there.
Give me one supply line to Engine 1 .

1027
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,357
Hey, we got two people inside.
We need you.

1028
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,425
Hey, hurry up with that supply line.

1029
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,527
Get back in there, get back in there.

1030
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,323
Breathe. Breathe, Lacey.
Breathe for me.

1031
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:34,566
Captain, you gotta get out of the
house. The roof is about to give.

1032
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,501
<i>Captain, do you read me?
You've gotta get out.</i>

1033
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,277
God, get me out of here.
Get us out of here.

1034
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,958
There, there.

1035
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,561
Get the girl. Get the girl.

1036
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,346
With the x-ray showing that...

1037
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,644
...he's left with a partial thickness burn
to the arm.

1038
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:09,849
You look terrible.

1039
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,089
l feel terrible.

1040
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,260
You gonna be okay?

1041
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,197
He sustained some first-degree
burns, but he should be fine.

1042
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,433
So this is your husband?

1043
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,772
-Yes.
-You've got a hero on your hands.

1044
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,674
Sir, l need you to keep this arm
elevated for 2 4 hours...

1045
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,314
...to help the swelling go down.

1046
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,848
Come back in 48 hours
to get it checked out again.

1047
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,579
-Well, let me get out of your way.
-You're not in our way. You can stay.

1048
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:44,124
No, it's all right.
l'll let you do your job.

1049
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,562
l'm gonna get you more gauze
to take home with you...

1050
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,564
...and fill that prescription
for your pain, okay?

1051
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,871
l wouldn't put that ring
back on your finger...

1052
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,640
...until your hand
has a chance to heal.

1053
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,911
My hand's gonna have to heal
with this ring on my finger.

1054
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,597
Mom, it'll be fine.

1055
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,165
lt's gonna heal up
in a couple of weeks.

1056
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,402
Yes, l got it wrapped up right now.
Can l speak with Dad, please?

1057
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,465
Okay, Mom, l got it.

1058
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,542
Now, would you please
hand the phone to Dad?

1059
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,538
Thank you.

1060
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,115
Dad, would you please ask Mom
to cut me some slack?

1061
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,185
l'm a fireman.
l'm gonna be around fires.

1062
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,187
l know. l know, Dad.

1063
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,087
l just don't like getting grilled
every time she picks up the phone.

1064
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,898
Yeah. Today, Day 23.

1065
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,260
But it was hard this morning.

1066
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,268
Yeah, the newspaper called me twice
wanting an interview.

1067
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,033
Seems l'm a hero with everybody
in the world except my wife.

1068
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:09,236
No. No, l'm not giving up.

1069
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,139
Thanks, Dad.

1070
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,013
All right, l'll talk to you later.

1071
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,515
Bye.

1072
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,069
Caleb, what are you doing?

1073
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,500
Why is this so hard?

1074
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,646
<i>Day 23, watch out for parasites.</i>

1075
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,515
<i>A parasite is anything that latches
onto you or your partner...</i>

1076
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:08,026
<i>...and sucks the life
out of your marriage.</i>

1077
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:11,097
<i>They're usually in the form
of addictions like gambling...</i>

1078
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,961
<i>...drugs or pornography.</i>

1079
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,865
<i>They promise pleasure,
but they grow like a disease...</i>

1080
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,166
<i>...and consume more and more
of your thoughts, time and money.</i>

1081
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:23,641
<i>They steal away your loyalty
and heart from those you love.</i>

1082
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,679
<i>Marriages rarely survive
if parasites are present.</i>

1083
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,281
<i>If you love your wife...</i>

1084
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,284
<i>...you must destroy any addiction
that has your heart.</i>

1085
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:36,015
<i>If you don't, it will destroy you.</i>

1086
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:04,311
Okay, Lord. No more addictions.

1087
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,827
Mr. Rudolph.

1088
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,307
Caleb.

1089
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:29,976
You doing okay today?

1090
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,709
No, not really.

1091
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:53,032
lrma, l don't want you
talking to that guy.

1092
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,601
He is weird.

1093
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,405
Takes one to know one.

1094
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,803
What?

1095
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,457
No.

1096
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,556
No.

1097
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,490
-Good morning.
-Hi, Mrs. Evans, how are you?

1098
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,431
l'm fine. l hope you are.

1099
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,865
l'm doing pretty good.

1100
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,667
l actually wanted to talk to you about
the equipment we've been looking at.

1101
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:50,300
l bet your parents are excited. When
a patient gets the right wheelchair...

1102
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,343
...it can make such a difference.

1103
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,174
l'm sorry, what?

1104
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,750
The bed and wheelchair we delivered
to your parents this morning.

1105
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,212
To my parents?

1106
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,788
Yes, they should have been delivered
by now.

1107
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,592
But l haven't paid for anything yet.

1108
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,785
Oh, it's actually
already been paid for.

1109
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,627
A gentleman called,
said that he wanted to pay...

1110
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,630
...for everything
that you'd picked out.

1111
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:16,635
Actually, he covered everything
plus some accessories.

1112
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,397
He said....

1113
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,208
Mrs. Holt?

1114
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:44,328
-lsn't this wonderful?
-Oh, she looks amazing.

1115
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:46,660
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1116
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,214
Has anyone ever told you
that you're wonderful?

1117
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,759
Maybe, but not today.

1118
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,658
Gavin, you didn't have to do that.

1119
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,821
-Do what?
-Giving money to help my parents.

1120
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,299
That was so thoughtful.

1121
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,326
Thank you.

1122
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,034
You're welcome.

1123
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,533
lt was the least l could do.

1124
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,115
-Do you have lunch plans?
-l do now.

1125
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,666
''Dear Catherine.

1126
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:02,043
l can't tell you how much
l've enjoyed getting to know you.

1127
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:06,241
l find myself
thinking about you often...

1128
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:09,577
...and l look forward
to seeing you every day.

1129
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,046
Gavin.''

1130
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:20,684
Yeah, l need to know if there's a Gavin
that works at the hospital.

1131
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,364
No, l just have a first name.

1132
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,749
Dr. Keller?

1133
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:47,053
-Yes?
-Caleb Holt.

1134
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,349
l need a word with you, please.

1135
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,186
lt's really not a good time.
l'm about to make my rounds.

1136
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,487
l think you need to make time.

1137
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:58,091
This is concerning Catherine,
my wife.

1138
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,099
All right, what can l do for you?

1139
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,665
l know what you're doing.

1140
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,544
l have no intention of stepping aside
as you try to steal my wife's heart.

1141
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,040
l've made some mistakes,
but l still love her.

1142
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:18,352
So just know
l am going after her too.

1143
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:24,021
And since l'm married to her,
l'd say l've got a head start.

1144
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:30,587
By the way,
thanks for helping me with my hand.

1145
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,663
My ring finger's feeling
a whole lot better.

1146
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,566
Y'all, l just saw Caleb and Dr. Keller
going at each other.

1147
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:12,399
He had his fist
all knuckled in his face.

1148
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,508
Are you serious?

1149
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,035
What are you all talking about?

1150
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,578
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

1151
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:23,808
l'm fine.
You sure got quiet really fast.

1152
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,180
Well, that's because
we decided to stop talking.

1153
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,787
What's up?

1154
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,220
l'm setting up an interview
in about 1 0 minutes...

1155
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:34,157
...but l was wondering if you guys
have seen Dr. Keller this morning.

1156
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,854
l think he was doing rounds,
maybe on the 8th Floor.

1157
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,693
Okay, well, l'll see y'all later.

1158
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,631
See you.

1159
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,601
Why didn't you tell her?

1160
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,366
-Because it ain't our business.
-But you told all of us.

1161
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:51,842
l don't want her to know her business
is our business if it ain't our business.

1162
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,207
<i>Hi.</i>

1163
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,244
Hey, how are you?

1164
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,754
-Hey, Catherine.
-How's the good doctor today?

1165
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:07,656
-Pretty busy, actually.
-Are we still on for lunch?

1166
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:10,396
You know, there's a few things
l need to catch up on.

1167
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,329
-l've gotten a little behind lately.
-Okay.

1168
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,436
-Well, maybe we could talk later.
-That'd be good.

1169
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,835
-All right, see you around.
-See you.

1170
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,420
-Hello, Catherine.
-Oh, hi, Anna. How are you?

1171
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,784
l'm doing well. And you?

1172
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,358
l'm okay, l guess.
Do you wanna sit down?

1173
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,290
l'd love to if l'm not disturbing you.

1174
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,089
Not at all.

1175
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:47,630
So, what's been going on
in your life these days?

1176
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:50,066
We haven't talked in a while.

1177
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,237
Well, it's been one of those years.

1178
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,874
Good or bad?

1179
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:01,581
You know, l hate to say it,
but mostly bad.

1180
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,911
You know when you get
to a fork in the road...

1181
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:09,079
...and you know that either way you go
is gonna change your life?

1182
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:13,653
Life does give you some of those.
Excuse me just a minute.

1183
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,129
So have you decided
which path to take?

1184
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,535
l think so.

1185
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,142
lt's just hard
not to second-guess yourself.

1186
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:36,144
Pardon me, l don't mean to pry,
but does this concern relationships?

1187
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:39,511
lt does.

1188
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,782
Catherine, you're so young.

1189
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,949
l would encourage you
to make your choices carefully.

1190
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,689
l'm trying to.

1191
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,467
But l'm also tired of feeling empty.

1192
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,393
Anna, it's so nice
to have someone treat you...

1193
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,836
...like they really care about you.

1194
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:04,707
Forgive me, but you're talking about
a certain young doctor, aren't you?

1195
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:08,777
l suppose it's no secret
as much as he and l talk.

1196
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:13,112
l couldn't help but notice
how you act around each other.

1197
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:17,054
But l also wonder
how your husband would feel.

1198
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,595
My husband has had his chance.

1199
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,926
And Dr. Keller is a good man.

1200
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,558
He treats me better than my husband
has treated me in years.

1201
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:32,968
He listens to me
and makes me feel important.

1202
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,008
l haven't felt that way
in a very long time.

1203
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,475
lt's always good to have that, but....

1204
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:44,949
But, sweetheart, if this doctor is trying
to woo you while you're still married...

1205
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:49,146
...what makes you think
he won't do that with someone else?

1206
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,657
l don't wanna talk about this, Anna.
We're getting personal.

1207
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,692
Oh, Catherine, l'm sorry.

1208
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,727
l didn't mean
to overstep my bounds.

1209
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,230
l need to go.
lt's good to see you, Anna.

1210
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:49,592
Catherine, are you okay?

1211
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:52,965
l'm fine.

1212
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,402
-Aren't you going to work?
-No.

1213
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:05,769
-Are you sick?
-l'll be fine.

1214
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,310
ls it your allergies?

1215
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:14,354
l said l'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

1216
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:18,157
Because if you need something,
l can go to the store.

1217
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,258
No, l'm okay. You can go.

1218
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:26,923
Okay.

1219
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:56,823
Can you sit up for me?

1220
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,167
You got a fever.

1221
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:40,306
Here.

1222
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:43,239
You think you can take this?

1223
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:01,294
Why are you doing this?

1224
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:08,096
l have learned
you never leave your partner.

1225
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,200
Especially in a fire.

1226
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:16,036
Caleb, what's happened to you?

1227
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,582
Dad asked me
if there was anything in me...

1228
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,615
...that wanted to save our marriage.

1229
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,614
And then he gave me something.

1230
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:33,452
l could let you read it.

1231
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:42,766
Was it this?

1232
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:46,873
How long have you known?

1233
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,801
l found it yesterday.

1234
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:52,737
So, what day are you on?

1235
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,810
Forty-three.

1236
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:58,512
There's only 40.

1237
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,650
Who says l have to stop?

1238
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,393
Caleb...

1239
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:16,259
...l don't know how to process this.

1240
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,597
This is not normal for you.

1241
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,137
Welcome to the new normal.

1242
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,981
You didn't wanna do this at first,
did you?

1243
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,356
No.

1244
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:42,655
But halfway through, l realized...

1245
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,129
...that l did not understand
what love was.

1246
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:52,464
And once l understood that,
l wanted to do it.

1247
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,638
Caleb, l want to believe
that this is real.

1248
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:02,504
But l am not ready
to say that l trust you again.

1249
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,449
l understand that.

1250
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:13,050
But whether you ever reach
that point or not...

1251
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:17,496
...l need you
to understand something.

1252
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,747
l am sorry.

1253
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:49,793
l have been so selfish.

1254
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:58,737
For the past seven years,
l have trampled on you...

1255
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,898
...with my words
and with my actions.

1256
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:10,542
l have loved other things
when l should have loved you.

1257
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:18,653
ln the last few weeks...

1258
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:24,863
...God has given me a love for you
that l had never had before.

1259
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,058
And l have asked him to forgive me.

1260
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:36,034
And l am hoping, l am praying...

1261
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,245
...that somehow
you would be able to forgive me too.

1262
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:53,326
Catherine, l do not want to live
the rest of my life without you.

1263
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:07,730
l'm supposed to give
those divorce papers...

1264
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,876
...to my lawyer next week.

1265
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:13,806
l just....

1266
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:19,710
l need some time...

1267
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:22,119
...to think.

1268
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,953
You can have all the time you need.

1269
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,259
-Hello, Mrs. Holt, how are you today?
-Fine, thanks.

1270
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:06,331
l hope your parents are doing well.

1271
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,832
That new bed and wheelchair
are certainly helping.

1272
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:11,699
l'm so glad.
Well, what can l do for you today?

1273
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:15,575
l just need to pick up a few linens
for the hospital bed for my mom.

1274
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:17,540
Sure, we have some in stock.

1275
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:20,703
Great, that's the only thing
that wasn't covered by the doctor...

1276
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,940
...when he purchased
that bed and wheelchair.

1277
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:24,379
The doctor?

1278
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:28,248
Yes, Dr. Keller,
our secret philanthropist.

1279
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:32,053
l don't think Dr. Keller
covered those things.

1280
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,387
No, l'm sure he did.
l spoke with him about it.

1281
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:41,094
Mrs. Holt, if l remember correctly,
$2 4,300 was given...

1282
01:40:41,268 --> 01:40:45,204
...for the bed and wheelchair,
but Dr. Keller was not the main giver.

1283
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,332
What?

1284
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:50,909
Of the amount given,
Dr. Keller gave $300.

1285
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,607
Then who gave the other?

1286
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:00,084
Your husband, Caleb.

1287
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:04,885
He came in about two weeks ago
and paid for everything.

1288
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,788
l assumed you knew.

1289
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:09,855
Two weeks ago?

1290
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:15,297
Yes, he told me not to tell anyone,
but l didn't think that included you.

1291
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,833
lt was the Tuesday before last.

1292
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:19,666
He called
and asked what the price...

1293
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,865
...of a particular bed
and wheelchair were.

1294
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:23,236
And l looked it up and....

1295
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:47,397
Oh, where is it?

1296
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:47,717
Oh, stop crying.

1297
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:58,300
Okay, explain RECEO.

1298
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,197
He ain't gonna get it.

1299
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:05,869
Rescue, exposure,
containment, extinguish--

1300
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:08,207
Captain, can l see you for a minute?

1301
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:11,283
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.

1302
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:17,985
Something wrong?

1303
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:20,416
Catherine is in the bay.

1304
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:23,929
-My Catherine?
-Yes, sir.

1305
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:46,077
Catherine?

1306
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:54,183
lf l haven't told you...

1307
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:58,164
...that you are a good man...

1308
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:00,594
...you are.

1309
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,435
And if l haven't told you...

1310
01:44:09,276 --> 01:44:11,744
...that l've forgiven you...

1311
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,907
...l have.

1312
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:25,819
And if l haven't told you...

1313
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:29,527
...that l love you...

1314
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:31,257
...l do.

1315
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:38,727
Something has changed in you,
Caleb.

1316
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:43,171
And l want what happened to you
to happen to me.

1317
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:51,146
lt can.

1318
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:58,722
ls it too late to ask you
to grow old with me?

1319
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:18,003
-Yes.
-Hey, what are you looking at?

1320
01:45:18,178 --> 01:45:20,043
Back up.
There ain't nothing to see here.

1321
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:21,237
Why? What's going on?

1322
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:23,679
Go back to your business.
Caleb's starting a fire.

1323
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:26,114
-Why's he starting a--?
-Ain't that kind of fire.

1324
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:27,913
Go back to your business. Go-- Hey.

1325
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:30,181
Put you on cleanup duty.

1326
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:36,788
Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph.

1327
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:39,051
Caleb.

1328
01:46:43,597 --> 01:46:46,293
l don't understand that boy.

1329
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:54,666
-How are you?
-Hi, son.

1330
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:03,209
l'm getting to where l know this trail
pretty well.

1331
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:07,183
-You're welcome to walk it anytime.
-l just might.

1332
01:47:08,655 --> 01:47:10,646
l wanna thank you, Dad.

1333
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:13,824
The love darRepoe changed my life.

1334
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:15,757
God changed your life.

1335
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:18,727
The love dare
was just a tool he used.

1336
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:21,434
l've already given it
to one of my firemen.

1337
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:24,627
Good. lt's meant to be passed on.

1338
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:30,366
l just can't tell you how grateful l am
that you didn't give up on me, Dad.

1339
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:33,843
Or on Mom, for that matter.

1340
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:42,184
Caleb, l wanna be a godly man.

1341
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:45,391
And l'm learning so much.

1342
01:47:46,526 --> 01:47:48,391
But there's something
l haven't told you.

1343
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:54,424
l wrote that notebook
in my own handwriting...

1344
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:57,293
...because l knew
you would accept it from me.

1345
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:01,469
But l didn't do the love dare
on your mom.

1346
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:03,666
She did it to me.

1347
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:07,946
What?

1348
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:09,741
Son...

1349
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:12,317
...l was the one
that wanted to leave.

1350
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,320
But God got ahold of your mother...

1351
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:20,854
...and she prayed and loved me
unconditionally.

1352
01:48:21,728 --> 01:48:25,027
lt was through her example
that l came to Christ.

1353
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:29,226
Mom did this?

1354
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:31,328
She's such a blessing to me.

1355
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:34,372
And she's grown so much.

1356
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:37,233
l love her with all my heart.

1357
01:48:40,547 --> 01:48:42,208
Dad, l....

1358
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,619
l have treated her so wrong.

1359
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:50,514
Caleb, she deserves your respect.

1360
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:21,313
Mom. Mom, l'm so sorry.

1361
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:25,924
Mom, l didn't know. l didn't know.

1362
01:49:26,092 --> 01:49:29,255
lt's all right, son.
lt's okay. lt's all right.

1363
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,557
Mom, please forgive me.

1364
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,827
l do, Caleb. You're forgiven.

1365
01:49:37,003 --> 01:49:39,130
l love you.

1366
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,065
l love you too, Mom.

1367
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,403
l love you so much.

1368
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:49,648
l love you, Caleb.

1369
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:01,818
We've gathered here today
to celebrate the reaffirmation of vows...

1370
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:03,292
...with Caleb and Catherine.

1371
01:50:03,463 --> 01:50:06,830
This may be the second time they've
made a commitment to this marriage...

1372
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,801
...it is the first time they've done so on
a foundation of faith in Jesus Christ.

1373
01:50:11,972 --> 01:50:13,940
''lt is the desire
of Caleb and Catherine...

1374
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,700
...to establish their vows
from this point on...

1375
01:50:16,876 --> 01:50:19,572
...as a covenant and not a contract.

1376
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:22,840
For marriage is a sacred institution
established by God...

1377
01:50:23,016 --> 01:50:26,179
...and one that is meant to last
for life.''

1378
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:33,856
''Caleb, in the presence of God
and these witnesses...

1379
01:50:34,027 --> 01:50:37,258
...do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

1380
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:39,955
...to this covenant marriage
to Catherine?''

1381
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,124
l do.

1382
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:47,230
''And, Catherine, do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

1383
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:49,932
...to this covenant marriage
to Caleb?''

1384
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,668
l do.

1385
01:50:51,845 --> 01:50:52,903
With all my heart.

1386
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:55,637
<i>Genesis 2:2 4 says:</i>

1387
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:58,716
For this reason, a man shall leave
his father and mother...

1388
01:50:58,885 --> 01:51:03,913
...and shall be joined to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh.
