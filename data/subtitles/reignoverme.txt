1
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:19,465
- New patient?
- Yes.

2
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:22,389
I was referred by my lawyer
about veneers.

3
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,384
You're a new patient. Fill this out...

4
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:27,310
so we know who to contact
in case we lose you in the chair.

5
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,936
That was a joke, sweetie.
I was being funny.

6
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,980
Hello.

7
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:40,855
Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson.

8
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,576
Oh, it's Miss Remar.

9
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:46,444
And I know who you are. I see another
doctor in the building regularly.

10
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,662
I've been on the elevator
with you a few times.

11
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,576
Oh, okay.

12
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,836
You're married?
I never noticed the ring before.

13
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,840
Oh, yes, I am. I'm married.

14
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,677
All right, what are we doing
for you today?

15
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:02,344
One veneer, is that right?

16
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:05,004
They told me you don't
usually do just one.

17
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,053
We do whatever's needed.
Allie.

18
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,980
All right. Let's see.

19
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,352
- Now, which one is it?
- I don't know.

20
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,186
You tell me.

21
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,201
So another cutie with a crush, huh?

22
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,454
What is it with you?

23
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,458
So you'll be back next week?

24
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:42,670
You're gonna schedule Miss Remar
next week for the veneer. Right?

25
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,134
Yeah. I'm gonna clear the
schedule the whole week...

26
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,797
so that you could be mentally
prepared for it. Okay?

27
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,427
It was so nice to finally meet you.

28
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:53,011
Oh, yeah. You too.

29
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,226
Okay.

30
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,062
I need the...

31
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,022
Oh, it's my daughters.

32
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,741
I'm gonna need that jacket.

33
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:11,205
- Okay, you stay, and then I'll reach.
- Sorry.

34
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:13,413
No, that's fine. I'm minutes away.

35
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,305
Charlie...?

36
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,340
Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman!

37
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,275
Charlie!

38
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,776
Charlie. Charlie Fineman.

39
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:22,275
I'm so sick of your father.

40
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:24,153
He's in that bed again.

41
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,943
Just as mean and evil as he can be.

42
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:29,690
Like a pig with a bullet in his head.

43
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,158
You take your walk today, Mom?

44
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:37,038
I'll take that as a no.

45
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,166
Dad?

46
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:48,796
I hate this city. I hate this damn city.

47
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,463
I don't know why you brought us here.

48
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:55,352
I got the papaya juice you asked for.

49
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:00,191
Hate this damn city.

50
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:05,734
And the smell. All that garbage
all up and down the street.

51
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,194
Daddy? I need money for the
dress for the dinner...

52
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,990
I'm going to with the Jacobsons.

53
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,488
And you'll have to drive me...

54
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:14,496
because Mom's gonna be
at Cherie's chorus practise.

55
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:16,123
Okay.

56
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,164
We have to talk about
getting a cell phone.

57
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,706
This morning, you said
we could talk about it tonight.

58
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,001
I thought we talked about
the cell-phone issue.

59
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,546
But I'm 13 and I still share
with my little sister.

60
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,959
Oh, right. Because you only
need a cell phone...

61
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:32,221
- ...if Mommy or Daddy's late...
- I ran into Charlie Fineman today.

62
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,266
Really? How is he?

63
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:40,144
I don't know. I was in the car
and he was on foot.

64
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:43,351
He was coming out of a hardware
store. He was carrying paint.

65
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,732
You think he's still practising?

66
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,188
Who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy?

67
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,493
He's an old college friend
of mine, baby.

68
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,579
He was my college roommate, actually.

69
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,121
I haven't talked to him
in a long, long time.

70
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,617
Is he the one from dental school...

71
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:06,124
whose family was on the plane?
Is that Charlie Fineman?

72
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,586
Yeah.

73
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,883
That's Charlie Fineman.

74
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:32,741
You know, I decided to sign us up
for another photography class.

75
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:38,120
You did?
You already signed us up?

76
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,041
Yeah, but this time
for the advanced one.

77
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,293
I thought we had fun last quarter,
didn't you?

78
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,832
What, you don't want to?

79
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,793
No, I do. Don't you?

80
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,592
I loved it.

81
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,421
- I had a really good time.
- Yeah.

82
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:54,971
- Didn't you love it?
- I did.

83
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,718
And now Advanced Photography?
I mean, wow. I'm... Yeah.

84
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:01,353
Good.

85
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,179
No sugar.

86
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,729
Don't take that to school, okay?

87
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,151
Whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks.

88
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,162
- Hey, Angela.
- Dr. Johnson.

89
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,257
What is it about us always leaving
the building at the same time?

90
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,383
- It's quitting time.
- That's true.

91
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,676
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

92
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,682
Good. Let me ask you something.
Most married men have hobbies.

93
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,510
Okay, Alan. Don't do this.
Come on.

94
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,891
- Don't do what?
- We talked about this.

95
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:46,597
It's not really fair for you
to wait for me out here on the street.

96
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:49,811
If you wanna make an appointment,
we can make an appointment.

97
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing.

98
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,318
Now, you remember the friend
I was asking you about?

99
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,649
The friend who has no friends?
Other than you?

100
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:59,032
Yeah, him. So he's
a married guy, right?

101
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,529
And he's got a great wife
and the whole nine.

102
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:06,700
But she will not let him...
I mean, it's like he can't just...

103
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,878
I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right?

104
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:11,004
They play poker, they golf,
they do shit.

105
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:13,581
Okay, you know what? Stop. Stop.

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,883
I can't treat you from the lobby
to the car park.

107
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:19,719
Treat me? I'm not...
I just asked you a question.

108
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,507
- Well, whatever you wanna call it...
- No, you're right.

109
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,844
- It's inappropriate.
- You're right. I get it.

110
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,219
Let me ask you one thing.

111
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:29,232
I want your opinion
as a woman, Angela.

112
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,811
As a woman.

113
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:35,023
Look, if I have
this recurring dream where...

114
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,906
I'm sitting on my couch...

115
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:41,072
and it turns into a big vat of rubber,
what is that?

116
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:45,455
Why don't you let me
refer you to someone else?

117
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:51,752
Okay. Well...

118
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:54,544
I hope it works out for you.

119
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,177
You wait for me enough times
out on the street, though...

120
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:01,098
you might owe me some dental work.

121
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,760
Have a nice day.

122
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,571
Bingo. There we go.

123
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:25,912
- That was a tough one.
- Okay. Absolutely.

124
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:29,533
Now it all will fall into place.

125
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,628
Dad, can you take me
to Becky Fishman's?

126
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,457
Sweetie, it's 9:30.

127
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,541
She wants me to spend the night.

128
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:38,544
Well, Daddy's had
a long day at work...

129
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,127
and he's finally finding some time
to enjoy himself.

130
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,681
Just have her come over here.

131
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:45,387
And we can study your French together.

132
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,718
Oh, you know what?
I'll take her. I'll go.

133
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,683
Babe. We've come this far.
We've been working on this all week.

134
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:54,308
I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then
I'll just come right back.

135
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't be mad if I have this
all done by the time you get back.

136
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:58,733
Because I'm on a roll here.

137
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,444
You're gonna miss out
on all the action.

138
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:04,951
Just make sure you
save me some sky, okay?

139
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:06,781
You know you owe that child bigtime.

140
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,530
You would've thought she got you
out of traffic school...

141
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,417
by the look on your face.

142
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,005
Good night, babe.

143
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:19,251
- Good night.
- Thanks.

144
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:28,137
Hey, Charlie. Charlie.
Charlie Fineman, hey!

145
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,310
Charlie, stop!

146
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,266
- Hey, Charlie. Hey, man.
- Yeah?

147
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:40,150
- It's Alan.
- Hey. How are you?

148
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,692
I saw you coming out of a paint store
a couple weeks ago and....

149
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:45,695
I was screaming for you,
honking the horn.

150
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,278
I stopped the car, jumped out
in traffic. It was crazy.

151
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:51,991
Then I tried to get in touch with you,
but nobody had any info on you.

152
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:53,911
Oh, good, good. Very cool.

153
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:57,004
- How you doing?
- So we know each other?

154
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,839
Are you kidding me?

155
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,761
It's Alan Johnson, Charlie.

156
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,052
We went to dental school together.

157
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,225
Burrows Hall. I was your college
roommate. You don't remember me?

158
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:12,015
Yeah, very cool. Very cool.

159
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:16,138
- Good. Good to see you, Burrows.
- It's Johnson.

160
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,977
Charlie, you seriously
don't remember me?

161
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:24,237
- We were college roommates?
- Yeah.

162
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,404
Yeah, you slept naked most nights.

163
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:31,030
And you were a sleepwalker.
It was the worst two years of my life.

164
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,458
Hey, are you practising, man?

165
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,248
I tried to get in touch
through the Dental Guild...

166
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,876
I'm practising all the time,
up in the valley.

167
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:41,420
Took down 12 of the Colossus so far.

168
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:45,175
The valley? What is that? Is that
a medical complex or something?

169
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,098
It's more like another dimension.

170
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,680
You take a journey
and discover yourself.

171
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,975
- Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink?
- I can't drink. I can't drink.

172
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,519
I can't drink. I can't drink.

173
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:01,940
I gotta get going.

174
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:05,030
Then a coffee or something.
Let's just go get a cup of coffee.

175
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,360
Real quick. I would just love to
catch up with you, man.

176
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,198
Hey, Charlie.

177
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,380
This okay?

178
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,139
You like trivia?

179
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:39,982
Name the Great Lakes.

180
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:43,821
The Great Lakes.
Can you name them?

181
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,445
Okay, Michigan is one.

182
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,620
Huron, Ontario, Michigan,
Erie and Superior.

183
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,069
That was an easy one.

184
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,826
That's fifth-grade shit.

185
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:05,423
So, what have you
been up to lately, Charlie?

186
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:10,673
I'm stuck between
Pale White and Moon White.

187
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,719
I tried Butterscotch Yellow.

188
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,850
I couldn't live with it.

189
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,520
You painting something?
You're remodelling or...?

190
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,985
You were my college roommate.

191
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:30,200
That was a long time ago.

192
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:38,074
- A whole other life.
- Oh, yeah. No shit.

193
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:43,208
It's good to see your face.

194
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,042
Johnson.

195
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:49,969
Yeah, it's good to
see you too, Charlie.

196
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,140
Yeah. All right.

197
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:58,848
You gotta take those shoes off.

198
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:07,769
Thank you.

199
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,272
Great record collection.

200
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,319
Yeah.

201
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,573
I'm happy with it.

202
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:18,656
- A lot of vinyl.
- Yeah. Over 5500 so far.

203
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,075
It's a work in progress.

204
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,420
Kitchen remodel?

205
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,083
What is this?

206
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:32,586
"Shadows of the Colossus."

207
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:59,827
Can I use your bathroom, Charlie?

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,957
Oh, in the back.

209
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,904
Nice music room.

210
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,516
Good?

211
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:04,886
Okay.

212
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,223
There you go, Allie. Thank you.

213
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm sorry about the way I behaved
the last time I was here, doctor.

214
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:22,907
But when I see you in the building,
you always seem very busy.

215
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:24,790
Preoccupied.

216
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:29,039
Even when you're with the
other doctors, you seem so solitary.

217
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,248
So alone.

218
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,049
I don't know why, but that seems
very familiar to me.

219
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,714
Yeah.

220
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,217
Well.

221
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,881
I hope you're...

222
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:46,555
I just thought that if you
wanted me to...

223
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:48,474
I would.

224
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:51,475
With my mouth.

225
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,397
I would.

226
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:57,071
You could lock that door...

227
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,234
tell the nurse not to come in.

228
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:02,488
I'd do it.

229
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,738
I'd enjoy making you happy.

230
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,096
You have to leave.

231
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:32,646
I have this odd sense of intimacy
towards you. I don't even know why.

232
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:35,025
I told my shrink, and she
said I should act on it.

233
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,105
Oh, she did?
You need to get a new shrink.

234
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,155
Get several.
And get a new dentist too.

235
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,282
You gotta get out of here, Miss Remar.

236
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:44,702
I'm serious. I need you to leave
right now. Please. Go.

237
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,532
Okay.

238
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,285
Come on.

239
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,246
Okay.

240
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,461
The fuck...?

241
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:58,467
I need you not to reschedule
Miss Remar for anything.

242
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,296
Okay.

243
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,341
Ever again. Nothing.

244
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:03,546
Okay.

245
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,634
I don't want this woman as a patient.

246
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,266
- Got it. I got it.
- Fine. Thank you.

247
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,976
Excuse me!

248
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,893
Not right now. Hey.
Melanie, call her.

249
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:17,569
- Miss Remar?
- On the phone, I mean. Don't...

250
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:22,739
Miss Remar, you need
to find another dentist.

251
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,442
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

252
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,447
Dr. Johnson don't want you
as a patient...

253
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,449
neither do any other doctors here...

254
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:31,162
so go somewhere, bury your face
in the phone book...

255
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:34,123
and find another dentist, all right?

256
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,006
- " Bury your face in the phone book"?
- Yes.

257
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,641
You have to be bold to make
these kind of people go away.

258
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,850
Thanks for holding.

259
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,075
Can I help you?

260
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:11,332
I'm just going up to see a friend
of mine, Charlie Fineman.

261
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,289
Nobody by that name
lives here. Sorry.

262
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:22,126
That's fine. I'll just wait
for the landlord.

263
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:23,963
That's me.

264
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:27,799
Landlady.
Adell Modell, landlady from hell.

265
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:30,727
Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson.
I'm a friend of Charlie's.

266
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:33,433
- Sure.
- We went to dental school together...

267
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:37,225
I was in his apartment the other night.
We were playing...

268
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:39,228
"Shadows of the Colossus"
or something.

269
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:43,236
You were up there in his apartment
the other night? That's a load of crap.

270
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,026
He hasn't had anybody
up there in four years.

271
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,491
Just me, Sugarman the accountant,
the cleaning girl.

272
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:50,406
He doesn't know
about the cleaning girl.

273
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:53,832
- I'm not lying to you. I was up there.
- Yeah.

274
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:56,457
He's remodelling his kitchen.
Now, how would I know that?

275
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,464
He's been remodelling that kitchen
once every couple of months.

276
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:01,755
That tells me nothing. Go away.

277
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,966
Johnson. Johnson!

278
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:07,338
- Yo.
- Hey.

279
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,758
Alan!

280
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,057
Alan Johnson.

281
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:14,019
This is my college roommate.

282
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:16,430
It's my college roommate.

283
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:19,063
I used to sleep in the nude.

284
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:22,727
Check this out.

285
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:27,153
I got a....
You'll appreciate this.

286
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:32,451
The Pretenders. It's one of the
great debut albums of all time.

287
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:34,700
Yeah, that's you.
Terrible taste in music.

288
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,877
No, no, not true. Not true.

289
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,211
Smell these things.

290
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:44,883
I love the way they smell.
Take a whiff.

291
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:48,847
Brings back a feeling.
Smells like the late '70s, don't it?

292
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:53,178
- The early '80s. Yeah.
- Charlie!

293
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:54,633
Charlie!

294
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:57,311
It's okay, Charlie.
I'll take care of them.

295
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,521
- Who's that?
- Charlie, we just wanna talk.

296
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:02,693
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- What?

297
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:03,893
Why? Who is that?

298
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:06,278
Johnson, hop on.
Hop on, Johnson.

299
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:08,192
- Hop on?
- Get on. Get on. Johnson.

300
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:10,325
- Who is that?
- Johnson, damn it, get on.

301
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:13,365
- Just get on the back.
- Wait a minute!

302
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,080
Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie!

303
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,541
Oh, shit! Charlie.

304
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:23,963
I know, I know. All right.

305
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,214
You're late. They're pissed.

306
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:07,499
Name the one national
U.S. monument that's movable.

307
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:11,046
Suck my ass, retard.
You're late. Get in there.

308
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,713
No. San Francisco cable cars.

309
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:17,177
Good. I didn't know that one either.
That's a good one.

310
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:19,642
That's a great one if you ever
wanna stump somebody.

311
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,756
If you guys could not laugh
at anything I say, that'd really....

312
00:24:45,923 --> 00:24:49,458
I'm trying to get my self-esteem
to go to, like, seven percent.

313
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:54,381
Could I get another Heineken?

314
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:57,226
- You want another root beer?
- I got enough. Thanks.

315
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:58,935
Thanks.

316
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,389
Hey, it was fun watching you
up there tonight, man.

317
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,732
It was good music.

318
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,361
I don't know if I'd go that far.

319
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:10,446
But you know what it reminded me of?
It reminded me of school.

320
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:14,114
When you used to jam to that
Bruce Springsteen album.

321
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:16,859
- What was the name of that album?
- Bruce Springsteen....

322
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,074
Yeah. What was that? The River.

323
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,076
- The River?
- The River. You remember that?

324
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,620
I was always trying to get you to play
The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire...

325
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:28,632
but you always wanted to
jam to The River.

326
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,460
I don't remember jamming to it.

327
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:33,256
Maybe if you smelled it,
it'd all come rushing back.

328
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,799
- This was fun, man.
- Oh, yeah.

329
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:40,471
I had a good day today.

330
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:42,803
Riding around on that silly scooter.
It was...

331
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,814
It was my first time doubles.

332
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:46,975
- It was fun. It was fun.
- Yeah.

333
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,393
I don't do anything like that.

334
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,074
Lot of girls here, Charlie.

335
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,736
That's gotta be half
of the appeal, right?

336
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,792
Why'd you ask me that?

337
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:08,918
I don't know.

338
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,007
I don't know. I'm just making
small talk, you know?

339
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:16,213
You're single now.
You can do whatever you...

340
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,927
- What?
- After what happened...

341
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,350
- ...with your family and everything...
- Whoa, hey, I don't have a family.

342
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,515
No. No, I know. I was just trying to
make small talk, but that was stupid.

343
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:29,938
Who sent you here?

344
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:33,104
- Did they send you here?
- What are you talking about?

345
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:35,688
- Are you a specialist?
- A sp... ? No, I'm not...

346
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,859
- What are you talking about?
- Don't lie to me!

347
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:40,705
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.

348
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,864
- Charlie, calm down.
- Why are you here?

349
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,701
Why? Why?

350
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:48,034
- Answer my fucking question.
- Charlie, you're screaming.

351
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,288
Why are you here right now
talking to me?

352
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,671
- Relax. Okay?
- Why? Why?

353
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:54,716
Shit!

354
00:26:55,887 --> 00:27:00,050
- The fuck is wrong with you?
- Why are you talking to me?

355
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:07,725
Oh, now I'm boring you?
Mr. Heckler?

356
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:10,650
I'm bored too. I'm sorry
if I'm boring you. I'm sorry.

357
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,567
You tell them to leave me alone!

358
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:58,739
Alan.

359
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:01,952
When you get a minute,
we need to see you.

360
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:07,947
Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us
a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit.

361
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:11,625
She claims that you sexually assaulted
her in the office on several occasions.

362
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:14,501
That is ridiculous, all right?
That's absurd.

363
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:16,583
Well, we checked with Melanie.

364
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,464
Donna Remar.
What do you know about her?

365
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:22,307
This woman is insane. Okay?

366
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,799
She came in,
I put a single veneer on her...

367
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:27,431
she tells me
she's got this obsession...

368
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:28,635
Excuse me, Marie.

369
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:32,229
She said she wants to
give me oral sex in the office.

370
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:36,228
You know what,
you need to make this go away.

371
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,729
We can't handle a hit like this
on our insurance.

372
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:40,816
Even if we win,
we're gonna get killed.

373
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:42,984
How do I do that?
How do I make this go away?

374
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:47,621
I don't know how you make it go away.
You see her again, you discuss it....

375
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,325
Damn. I mean, isn't this exactly
like what it was the last time?

376
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:53,495
Woman falls for you,
you lead them along...

377
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:57,336
- You know what, John?
- No. No.

378
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:01,050
What, Johnson?

379
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,016
I'll get into it.

380
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,065
Dr. Johnson?
I need to speak with you.

381
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,036
I'm Ginger Timpleman...

382
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,449
and I'm Charlie Fineman's
mother-in-law.

383
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:37,377
- Did you know Charlie's family?
- No.

384
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:40,419
His parents died
when he was in grade school.

385
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:44,009
He lived with an aunt before college.
I met her a couple of times.

386
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,932
She passed just before the wedding.

387
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:50,971
You know, my wife and I,
we tried to call him so many times.

388
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:55,013
Hadn't seen him in years, and I read
about what happened in the paper...

389
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:59,189
and I was just... I was just
heartbroken for him, you know?

390
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,607
For them.

391
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,523
He just, you know, shut down.

392
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:06,198
Quit work. He stopped
wanting to talk about her.

393
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,575
Then he acted like
he didn't remember them.

394
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,788
Then he pretended
he didn't remember us.

395
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:11,988
Yeah.

396
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,159
All my husband and I
wanna do is see him.

397
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:18,250
And that crazy landlady and his
business manager, Sugarman...

398
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:20,748
both conspire to keep us away.

399
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:23,962
- Sugarman?
- Yeah, I don't care for him.

400
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:28,339
Who knows what that little shyster's
taking from Charlie.

401
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,054
- What is there to take?
- Between the government payout...

402
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:34,394
the insurance policy, Charlie
has enough to take care of himself...

403
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,438
put it that way.

404
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:46,948
My husband retired young.
He was a cop.

405
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:51,787
You know, we were young.
Young to be grandparents.

406
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:56,082
I was gonna do nothing but travel...

407
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,040
and spoil my granddaughters.

408
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:04,801
Then those monsters flew over here
from across the world...

409
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:08,137
and rearranged my dance card.

410
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,759
- Sorry.
- Of course you are.

411
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,226
But he needs help.

412
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:20,644
Not the kind that landlady and
some little accountant can give him.

413
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:22,645
He needs a therapist.

414
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,730
And he needs family.

415
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:28,904
Guess what. Jonathan and I
are the only family Charlie's got.

416
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:39,584
Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door.
Somebody's at the door.

417
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,545
Cherie. Cherie.

418
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:44,501
- Get away from the door.
- What are you doing?

419
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:48,009
You don't go to the door in the
middle of the night. You know that.

420
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,255
I think it's Charlie Fineman.

421
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:51,760
Is that Charlie?

422
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,304
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- Okay.

423
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:57,851
So let him in.

424
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,438
Yeah?

425
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:08,147
Were you in bed already?
What's going on? It's 10:30.

426
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,116
I'm always in bed at 10:30.

427
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:14,578
- That sucks. That's grim.
- You don't have any root beer on you...

428
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:16,206
- ...do you?
- No, why?

429
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:17,868
Alan.

430
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,827
Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane.

431
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:26,172
Hi, I believe we met
about 15 years ago in Central Park.

432
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:29,711
- I don't expect you to remember it.
- I don't.

433
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:32,048
Okay.

434
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:35,054
This is our daughter Cherie.

435
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,395
Nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman.

436
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,479
Go to bed, sweetheart.

437
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,563
What's going on, Charlie?

438
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:47,405
You wanna go out, man?
Go have some fun? Let's hang out.

439
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,688
- Right now?
- Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's...

440
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:53,903
- Can he go out? Is he allowed out?
- Charlie, don't do that.

441
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:56,237
Don't ask my wife permission
for me to go out.

442
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:58,739
I'm right here in front of you.
I'm not 7 years old.

443
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:01,538
You're right. Can you go out?

444
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:13,721
She's threatening to sue you?
What does she want?

445
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,381
She wants to go down on me.

446
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,935
- Well, you tell her you can't do that.
- No, I know.

447
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:25,100
- You tell her you're married?
- She knows.

448
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,352
It's not a deterrent for this one.

449
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:30,280
I mean, she's got some kind of
a fixation or something.

450
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:33,235
Oh, well, fix it for her.

451
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,739
It's not funny, Charlie.

452
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,947
- No, no, no.
- It's really not funny, I mean....

453
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,198
- My partners are up my ass.
- Right.

454
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,948
We already pay an obscene amount
in liability insurance.

455
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:46,461
You should tell your partners they can
do to you what the girl wants to do.

456
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:48,339
Fuck them.

457
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,039
I don't know.

458
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:53,384
It's a five-year lease,
50 grand a month...

459
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:56,306
my name on it.
My partners get pissed off...

460
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:59,012
and they leave me holding the bag,
that's it, I'm done.

461
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:01,510
- Yeah.
- I put the whole thing together.

462
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:04,558
They act like I'm the one
who works for them.

463
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,143
But the girl, what are you
gonna do about that?

464
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,356
That's weird, you know?
It's kind of heavy.

465
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:15,066
Yeah, it is. I'm telling you,
this girl's seriously troubled.

466
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:18,861
Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems
if she wants to blow you.

467
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:22,241
She's out of her mind.
I've seen that thing.

468
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,327
- That's very funny.
- No, no, no.

469
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,495
No, it is... Are you having fun?

470
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,458
To tell you the truth,
I kind of am, Johnson.

471
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,755
It's nice to see you
in the soup like this.

472
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,085
It's funny. Just not used to it.

473
00:34:34,262 --> 00:34:37,595
- Here. Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

474
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,758
Any chance of you
getting audited this week?

475
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:42,010
Because that would make things
even better.

476
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:43,846
Or maybe we could go somewhere...

477
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:46,976
and you could burn your tongue
on some pizza. I'd like that too.

478
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,893
I would love that.

479
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,320
I need you to hold for one moment.

480
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:01,868
You are not gonna believe
who this is on the phone.

481
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,531
- Who?
- The nut.

482
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,211
At this point in my life,
you're gonna have to be very specific.

483
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,538
Donna Remar.

484
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:14,878
She wants to come in for another
consultation for some more veneers.

485
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:18,303
Can you believe that? Ma'am?

486
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:21,142
- Ma'am?
- Schedule it.

487
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:26,680
- Excuse me?
- Schedule it in my office alone.

488
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,813
- Morning, Oscar.
- Hey, doc.

489
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:30,727
Good to see you.

490
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:35,730
- Hello, Dr. Johnson.
- Hello.

491
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:37,816
- I've got a question.
- I'm sure you do.

492
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,199
- No, it's not about me this time.
- How refreshing.

493
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:45,162
It's about a friend. Really, though.
I mean, really, a real friend.

494
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:51,462
He lost his whole family
in a plane crash.

495
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,959
- Right.
- It's horrible.

496
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:55,458
I mean, his wife, his three daughters.

497
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:57,177
This guy used to be a dentist.

498
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:59,717
- How long ago?
- It's a few years ago...

499
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,472
and he's lost now.
You know? He's completely lost.

500
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,597
I bumped into him. We used to be
college roommates for two years.

501
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:09,606
- He didn't even remember me.
- Well, offhand, that sounds like...

502
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:13,309
post-traumatic stress disorder.
Maybe worse.

503
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:17,353
I couldn't really know without seeing
him. It sounds like he needs help.

504
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,405
- Is he getting help?
- I don't know.

505
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,615
I mean, the whole thing is....

506
00:36:21,786 --> 00:36:24,573
It's really odd, you know?
It's crazy odd.

507
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:26,992
How are you?

508
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,789
I'm fine.
I got nothing to complain about.

509
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,286
Does that mean you're fine?

510
00:36:32,463 --> 00:36:36,675
Very good. You are gonna
be sending me a bill one day.

511
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,464
You might wanna check your mailbox.

512
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,387
- Okay.
- Dr. Johnson, I think it would be...

513
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:45,385
really good for you
to talk to someone.

514
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:48,600
I just sense that it would be...

515
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,309
good for you to be
a little bit more communicative.

516
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,981
I hope that didn't offend you.

517
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:58,191
Okay. Well, I'll see you soon?

518
00:36:58,364 --> 00:36:59,395
Okay.

519
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,548
- Charlie.
- In the back!

520
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,339
- Hope the shoes are off.
- Shoes are off. Shoes are off.

521
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,312
Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man.
You almost done?

522
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:36,604
Is that The River?

523
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,651
Yeah.

524
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,198
You know, I gotta get you enrolled
in a music-appreciation class.

525
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:45,367
Oh, right, yeah.
Tell that to Clarence Clemons.

526
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:47,695
What's going on?
What's going on with the girl?

527
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:50,624
The crazy girl, the one who wants
your penis. How's she doing?

528
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,876
- Let's not talk about her.
- Yeah, you wanna... ? Lose that tie.

529
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:56,583
Lose the tie and the scarf.
The whole outfit.

530
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,547
- For what?
- Come on, take it off.

531
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:01,338
Psychedelic time. Psychedelic time.

532
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,550
I smell a Fineman jam session
coming on.

533
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,553
Yeah, Burrows Hall-style.
Burrows Hall.

534
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:09,884
Jamming and jamming and jamming.

535
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,433
- Here.
- I don't play guitar, Charlie.

536
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:14,265
Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist.

537
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,896
You pull people's teeth all day.
It don't matter.

538
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:21,196
Come on. Come on. All right.
Get that in you. Get that in you.

539
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:24,116
- Let me do this.
- You'll get to this. Come on.

540
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,694
Let me hear some of that.

541
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,037
I don't know how to play this.

542
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,270
Charlie Fineman!

543
00:38:53,438 --> 00:38:57,732
- Alan Johnson. Alan Johnson!
- Charlie Fineman!

544
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,644
Good night, Jersey!

545
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:02,524
- Philadelphia. Philadelphia!
- Good night, Philly!

546
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:09,776
Baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you
know I don't ever do anything like that.

547
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,113
I just didn't wanna call you
and wake you up.

548
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,745
I was stuck in Charlie world.
I couldn't...

549
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:17,617
leave.

550
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,621
This is not okay.

551
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:23,005
You staying out all night...

552
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:24,456
it's not acceptable.

553
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:30,632
I'm just saying,
the guy's in a lot of pain.

554
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,104
It's sad over there, baby. It's just...

555
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,347
Just a sea of sadness.

556
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:46,984
- Yeah.
- Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.

557
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,237
- You don't have an appointment, sir?
- Oh, we're friends.

558
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,826
- What...?
- We were college roommates.

559
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:55,784
- And?
- I used to sleep in the nude.

560
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:04,507
- Charlie?
- All right, come in.

561
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:07,427
I hear " Colossus."

562
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:08,626
Hey.

563
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,090
Hey, hey, buddy.
Take the shoes off. I told you.

564
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:15,765
I told you.

565
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,519
Hey, didn't you just...?

566
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:31,536
All right. All right.

567
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:37,575
Hey, let me try it.

568
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,292
Hang on.

569
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,832
- Let me try it.
- Just watch me do it first.

570
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:44,211
Let me just try it.

571
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:47,468
- Okay, how do you shoot it?
- Square is to stab him.

572
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:50,672
That's the bird. You wanna
shoot him, get his attention.

573
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:53,385
All right.
All right, get your arrow ready.

574
00:40:53,558 --> 00:40:57,057
And let me pluck him
right in the uterus.

575
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:00,647
Aim what?

576
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:02,475
Oh, fuck.

577
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:05,059
I could show you how to do it,
give you some hints...

578
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:07,063
but I'll warn you,
it's very addictive.

579
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:09,563
Well, I don't have
an addictive personality...

580
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:12,410
so just show me how to do it.

581
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:16,162
Is something I said funny?

582
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:17,825
All right.

583
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,704
That'll call your horse.
The triangle is how you jump....

584
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,419
Okay, okay, very good.

585
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:24,745
- Stab his arm.
- I'm stabbing him in the arm.

586
00:41:24,922 --> 00:41:28,007
- No, you gotta stab in the right spot.
- I'm stabbing it right there.

587
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:29,338
You gotta be on the light.

588
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,791
- Shit.
- That's not gonna work.

589
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,259
I gotta climb this big son of a bitch...

590
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:35,507
Look, just put it down, all right?
Rest.

591
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:38,055
Next time you come, you'll be better.
Let it soak in.

592
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:41,846
No, no, no. Right now.
No next. Now.

593
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:44,596
I thought you don't have
an addictive personality.

594
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:47,064
That was the line of the night, man.

595
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:48,268
You're an addict.

596
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:53,108
- Say it, man. Say you're an addict.
- Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right.

597
00:41:57,413 --> 00:42:00,284
- Come on, now, stab his wing.
- Oh, God.

598
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,792
- Oh, I'm on your ass, bird.
- Stab his wing. All right. Yeah.

599
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:07,459
Colossus!

600
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:29,316
That's the first three....

601
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:31,895
Okay, now, wait.
You said they get bigger too?

602
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:33,615
Well, no, it's different.

603
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,906
It's like you're gonna use
a bow and arrow more.

604
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:39,327
- Each one will have different powers.
- What are we doing?

605
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:43,368
Wait a minute, Charlie,
you said get a burger, man. I can't...

606
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:46,828
I can't do this.
I gotta work in the morning.

607
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:49,246
Yeah, so you'll work,
you'll be tired. So what?

608
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:53,416
This is like a marathon, man.
It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't...

609
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:57,010
You'll go to sleep tomorrow night
at 8:00 instead of 10:30.

610
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:59,851
How's that?
Is that enough sleep, you faggot?

611
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:01,927
Hey, don't call me faggot.

612
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:04,096
- Are you a faggot?
- Quit saying faggot.

613
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:06,478
Just don't say faggot.

614
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,642
Don't just call people faggot.
That's rude.

615
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,519
To a gay guy it is.
To you, it's just...

616
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:18,026
a funny word,
like pound cake or pickle.

617
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:22,365
You're a fucked-up dude, man.

618
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,283
I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay.

619
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:26,498
You really need some Mel.

620
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:28,413
You need some Mel.

621
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:30,331
I'll take one adult and one faggot.

622
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:35,011
Come on, you really need
to come in here.

623
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,304
Johnson.

624
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:40,347
- Johnson.
- Okay.

625
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,509
Good decision.

626
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:51,558
Hey! The sheriff is a nig...

627
00:43:51,986 --> 00:43:54,821
- What did he say?
- The sheriff is near.

628
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:56,359
No.

629
00:43:57,617 --> 00:43:59,526
The sheriff is a nig...

630
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:09,752
I ain't got nobody.

631
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:12,708
And nobody cares for me.

632
00:44:17,345 --> 00:44:18,969
He's out of his mind.

633
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:23,890
- Richard Pryor, he did his own thing.
- They both did great, obviously...

634
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,105
but I can only imagine,
if they would have done another one?

635
00:44:28,856 --> 00:44:31,608
Janeane's called 15 times.

636
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:35,935
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

637
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:39,447
Where have you been? I've been
calling you for the last three hours.

638
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:43,911
I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off.
I was in this Mel Brooks marathon.

639
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,536
I've never laughed so hard.
I gotta bring you down here.

640
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:50,622
- This thing is crazy.
- Alan, I need you to listen to me.

641
00:44:52,797 --> 00:44:54,955
Your father's died.

642
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,090
- What?
- And I've been trying to reach you...

643
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,502
- What did you just say?
- Your mother called here...

644
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,303
a couple hours after you left.

645
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:03,965
He died in his sleep, in his bed...

646
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:07,724
and Mom's here with us now and
she's very upset and she needs you.

647
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:11,271
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
He's dead?

648
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,352
I'm sorry, baby.

649
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,939
- Where are the girls?
- They're with Mom on the couch.

650
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,825
They're fine.

651
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:27,903
- I'll be home as soon as I can.
- Will you please hurry up?

652
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:30,122
Yeah, I will.

653
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:41,792
Everything cool?

654
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,933
My dad just died.

655
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:52,980
Died, like...

656
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,854
- ...dead?
- Yeah.

657
00:45:57,779 --> 00:45:59,855
You wanna go get some breakfast?

658
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,988
Charlie, my father just died.

659
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:09,371
Yeah. There's a store
that's gonna open up soon.

660
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,580
Sells kitchen counters.
I wanna take you there.

661
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:14,159
- They got marble tops.
- Charlie, my father just died.

662
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:17,207
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I wanna hang, though.

663
00:46:17,382 --> 00:46:20,548
Come on.
Let's not waste all this Mel.

664
00:46:20,718 --> 00:46:23,007
We just got a good dose of Mel.

665
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,219
Are we hanging?

666
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:30,726
No.

667
00:46:32,397 --> 00:46:34,354
We're not hanging.

668
00:46:45,868 --> 00:46:51,159
Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese.
Come on, don't be such a pussy.

669
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:28,575
All right, does everybody
see what it is?

670
00:47:32,498 --> 00:47:36,448
Here it is. At the bottom.
See? Good look.

671
00:47:36,628 --> 00:47:39,463
Come on. What do you think?

672
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:00,811
- Yeah.
- Johnson?

673
00:48:00,985 --> 00:48:02,812
- Yep.
- I'm Sugarman.

674
00:48:02,987 --> 00:48:06,154
Bryan Sugarman?
Did I catch you at a bad time?

675
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:09,491
Well, I just came back from burying
my father, but other than that...

676
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:12,448
Cool.
Let me just say up front, Alan...

677
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:15,113
I make it my business
to watch this guy's back.

678
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,747
- That's what I do. I look out for him.
- Okay.

679
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,161
Now, obviously,
I can't stop him from doing this...

680
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:23,090
without going down
a very dangerous legal road.

681
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:25,546
But rest assured,
I'll do anything short of that...

682
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:27,462
to not give you a million dollars.

683
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:30,720
I don't know
what you're talking about.

684
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:33,174
He wants me to give you
a million dollars.

685
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:34,430
He has that kind of money?

686
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:37,520
That's none of your business.
That's my business. It's what I do.

687
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:40,855
We've already established that.
I won't let him be manipulated.

688
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:43,184
Sugarman, calm down, okay?

689
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:46,113
I don't want his million dollars.

690
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,195
Tell him I'm not mad at him and we're
still friends, okay? Just tell him that.

691
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:52,149
- You're being straight?
- Yes.

692
00:48:52,328 --> 00:48:55,697
I don't need his million dollars, okay?
Just tell him that.

693
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,533
Okay. I like that.

694
00:48:57,709 --> 00:48:59,997
Okay, good, then I've done my job.

695
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:03,875
Yeah. Good job.

696
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,541
Come on in and have some food.

697
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,385
Go ahead.

698
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:13,216
Daddy, your friend is here.

699
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,512
The one who acts
like he's younger than JoJo.

700
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,680
Charlie Fineman?

701
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:22,557
Honey, don't be like that, okay?

702
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,225
Don't judge people.
That's not polite.

703
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:33,487
Hey.

704
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,152
I'm sorry about your dad.

705
00:49:36,331 --> 00:49:37,659
Thanks.

706
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:41,367
I behaved badly that night.
I know I did.

707
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:43,252
All right? I'm sorry.

708
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:48,504
And you wanted to give me
a million dollars to make up for it?

709
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,510
I don't have any friends
other than you, Johnson.

710
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:01,601
I got you something.

711
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:10,448
- The River.
- Absolutely.

712
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,109
- And Quadrophenia.
- Yeah.

713
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:14,192
Another album you
used to torture me with.

714
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:17,702
Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson.

715
00:50:17,872 --> 00:50:19,283
That's a nice gift.

716
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,458
Too late to go for the million?

717
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,377
- Hey, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

718
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:28,339
- Wanna get some breakfast?
- Yeah.

719
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:31,509
- Come on.
- All right.

720
00:50:33,221 --> 00:50:35,628
Just me and you here?

721
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:38,804
Hey, everybody...

722
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:41,812
this is Charlie. Charlie...

723
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,771
this is everybody. Come on in.

724
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:47,982
These guys are staying?

725
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:53,818
Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying.

726
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:28,605
Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson.
We're having lunch today.

727
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:30,852
We're having Chinese.

728
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:34,655
I can't tell you how happy
that makes me.

729
00:51:49,964 --> 00:51:53,131
The last time you were
in a dental office, anyway?

730
00:51:55,553 --> 00:51:57,759
Need to schedule you for a cleaning?

731
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,338
Come on.
Let's go get something to eat.

732
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:09,559
You miss it?

733
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:11,686
Miss what?

734
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,402
- Nothing. Forget it.
- What? What? Come on.

735
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:17,317
Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it.

736
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:20,825
No, what do you think I missed,
being a dentist?

737
00:52:20,995 --> 00:52:22,158
Do you?

738
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,824
Why?

739
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:26,750
- Why what?
- Why are you asking me?

740
00:52:26,918 --> 00:52:28,910
Are you trying to focus me?

741
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:32,871
Is that it?
Did they send you here to focus me?

742
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:37,047
Yeah, you got me.
That's it. I'm with the CIA...

743
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,212
and this is Operation Focus Fineman.

744
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,966
- Are you kidding me?
- Better not be.

745
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,592
Charlie, if we're gonna be friends,
you have to be able to trust me.

746
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,260
- Thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

747
00:52:47,438 --> 00:52:50,143
That's why I can't pretend
I don't know anything about you.

748
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:52,890
Is that a threat, though,
to not be friends?

749
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,770
No. I'm saying friends talk about
what's going on in their lives.

750
00:52:56,948 --> 00:52:58,739
You're an asshole.

751
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,280
Charlie... Hey, Charlie!

752
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:03,908
What the fuck is wrong with you?

753
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,491
Get out of here, man!

754
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:06,696
Charlie, get the f...

755
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,585
Okay, okay. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

756
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:13,540
Leave me alone! All right?

757
00:53:14,882 --> 00:53:16,211
Charlie, get out of here!

758
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:22,424
Yeah. All right.

759
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:24,805
Shut your mouth.

760
00:53:26,185 --> 00:53:28,855
What are you still doing in here?
I told you to leave.

761
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:33,139
Because this isn't your office. I left!
This is public property.

762
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,524
- This isn't close to public property.
- Yes, it is!

763
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:38,649
- Get out of here, man!
- I'll call the police if you don't leave.

764
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:41,065
- It's okay. Let me handle it.
- No, it's not! He's...

765
00:53:41,242 --> 00:53:43,069
Melanie, shut the damn window!

766
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,704
Jesus.

767
00:53:48,374 --> 00:53:51,375
We can't keep
doing this shit, Charlie.

768
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:07,632
Look, I don't know what I said to you
in there that got you so pissed off...

769
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,017
but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right?

770
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:11,516
All right.

771
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:14,774
- Jesus.
- I know.

772
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:20,947
- Dr. Johnson.
- Miss Remar.

773
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:24,319
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. Everything's good.

774
00:54:24,535 --> 00:54:27,869
- I have an appointment scheduled.
- Just check in with Melanie.

775
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:31,706
- Maybe I should come back.
- No, no, it's fine. Just check in.

776
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:33,833
Check in with Melanie.

777
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:41,509
The one who...?

778
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,055
Doctor will see you in the office.

779
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:03,238
That gorgeous girl wants to blow you?

780
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:06,077
- Charlie, come on.
- She wants to blow you?

781
00:55:06,244 --> 00:55:07,524
- Look, get out...
- Come here.

782
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,862
Are you crazy? Get out of here.

783
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:11,415
- She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, I know.

784
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:14,786
Way you were talking about... Thought
she was a beast or something.

785
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:17,997
- I gotta straighten this out.
- All right, but how hot is that girl?

786
00:55:18,172 --> 00:55:20,046
- She's fine. She's hot.
- She's the hottest.

787
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,588
- Is she not the hottest?
- Charlie, will you get out...?

788
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,714
Let me go in for you.
Let me get the blowjob.

789
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:28,426
- Let me see that woman.
- Oh, you're playful now? Get out.

790
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,679
Stop it! Get out of here!

791
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,093
Did you smell that?
She even smells good!

792
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,550
Jesus.

793
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,229
- I wanna know what is going on.
- Nothing is going on.

794
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,439
- Don't tell me nothing's going on.
- Calm down.

795
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,611
- Let me explain it, okay?
- All right, explain it.

796
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:48,445
She's like out of a 1940s movie.

797
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,111
Did you see that girl?

798
00:55:51,706 --> 00:55:55,157
I mean, that was just perfection.

799
00:56:04,302 --> 00:56:05,547
You okay?

800
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,629
"Okay"?

801
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,424
No, I wouldn't use that word.

802
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:13,346
Well, thank you for seeing me.

803
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,770
Did I have a choice, Miss Remar?
I mean....

804
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:19,810
You've really put me in a terrible
position here at my office.

805
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:22,939
Can we just cut to it?
I don't wanna take a lot of your time.

806
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:24,654
Yeah.

807
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:27,356
This letter...

808
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,697
that you sent my...

809
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:31,992
I can do this quick.

810
00:56:32,163 --> 00:56:34,120
Wait a... No, no.

811
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,701
Please.

812
00:56:40,588 --> 00:56:44,337
Recently, I've come through
a rotten divorce.

813
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:47,463
I was married for 10 years.

814
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,342
My husband was having
an affair for five of them.

815
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:54,059
They had another life
here in the city.

816
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:56,184
He had two lives.

817
00:56:56,354 --> 00:56:59,308
I was walking down the street
one day and I saw them.

818
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:03,349
And I followed them,
and it was truly like a dream.

819
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:06,854
I spoke to a neighbour
and she talked about them...

820
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:11,243
as if they were the Joneses
living next door all these years.

821
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:15,740
And in that moment,
I lost my equilibrium.

822
00:57:16,124 --> 00:57:18,247
And I fell,
right there on the sidewalk.

823
00:57:18,418 --> 00:57:21,502
And the thing is, Dr. Johnson,
I haven't yet gotten up.

824
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,957
Now, my behaviour towards you
is inexcusable, I know that.

825
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:28,543
I behaved in a way
I don't normally behave.

826
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,049
What I've done by even threatening
a lawsuit is so repulsive to me.

827
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:35,680
I even lied to you when I told you
that my therapist...

828
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,512
had told me to act on my thoughts.

829
00:57:37,979 --> 00:57:42,142
I wanted to come in and see you
and tell you that I am so sorry.

830
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:45,353
And that I am very embarrassed.

831
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:50,229
And that you won't be having
any more trouble from me.

832
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:55,567
- I promise that to you.
- Okay.

833
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:56,778
Okay.

834
00:57:57,248 --> 00:58:01,080
- Okay. Well, I'll go now.
- Yeah.

835
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:13,259
I'll leave.

836
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,094
Elizabeth, can I get a cup of coffee?

837
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:01,977
Sure. Dr. Johnson,
do you want anything?

838
00:59:02,146 --> 00:59:04,388
No, he's fine.

839
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,396
Me? Get him to talk?

840
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:10,147
No way. That's not what I do.

841
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:12,113
Well, he needs to talk to somebody.

842
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:15,069
He's in trouble.
He needs to see somebody.

843
00:59:15,243 --> 00:59:18,991
He's got you. He's got a friend.
That's big. That's a major step.

844
00:59:19,163 --> 00:59:21,322
No, he needs more help
than I can give him.

845
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,667
What, are you gonna save him now?
Is that what this is all about?

846
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,674
I was his best friend.

847
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:33,712
His golfing
and his fishing buddy, okay?

848
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:36,342
- Our families vacationed together.
- Okay.

849
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:39,183
On September 12th, 2001,
that was over.

850
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,844
He wants nothing to do with me.

851
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:43,428
Nothing to do with my wife.

852
00:59:43,604 --> 00:59:45,644
He likes you, Alan. You know why?

853
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:48,101
- Why?
- It's very simple.

854
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:52,855
Because you know nothing about
Doreen and Jenny and Julie and Gina.

855
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:55,486
Or Spider, the family poodle.

856
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,362
You know nothing about them,
so he figures you won't ask questions.

857
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:02,028
He figures you'll just let him be.

858
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:05,199
Now, how funny is this?

859
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:07,832
That you're up here wanting me
to help out in another...

860
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,577
fruitless campaign
to get Charlie to see a shrink.

861
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:16,294
The one guy he figures
would just let him be.

862
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,682
- Hey.
- Hey.

863
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,564
I think I'm gonna get him some help.

864
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:30,609
Charlie.

865
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:32,568
Did he ask you for help?

866
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:34,065
Well, he needs help.

867
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:37,405
He's gotta get back in the game.
He's gotta get his life back.

868
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:40,659
The people around him right now,
they're just enabling him.

869
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:44,829
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, what do the experts say?

870
01:00:48,252 --> 01:00:51,752
I don't know. I'll find out.

871
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:54,081
I know he needs help.

872
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:59,260
You think you have time for all this?
I mean, with work and your mom and...

873
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:05,015
I know you don't think so,
but I'm trying to help him.

874
01:01:05,186 --> 01:01:07,677
Trying to help my friend.

875
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:14,777
Okay.

876
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,244
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah. Thank you.

877
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:30,290
Just glad you wanted to do this
just out of nowhere.

878
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:33,546
You know, I think it's about time
you get your head around what is...

879
01:01:33,715 --> 01:01:35,257
and what isn't good music.

880
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,797
Oh, right, right, right.

881
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,638
Oh, Graham Nash.
Songs For Beginners.

882
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:43,177
Just the album cover alone.

883
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,887
Look at that face.
He knows he made a great record.

884
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,685
Oh, okay, wait. Right here.

885
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:50,096
Okay. We got O'Jays.

886
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,147
We got... What else we got?

887
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:54,689
The Soul Tr... Hey.
From the Funk Side.

888
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:57,316
Now, what record collection's
complete without this?

889
01:01:57,488 --> 01:02:00,026
I'll put that on my list.

890
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:04,025
Hey, Alan.

891
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:05,579
- Oh, hey, Nigel.
- Hey.

892
01:02:05,747 --> 01:02:08,202
- How are you?
- Good. What are you doing here?

893
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:11,375
Oh, I'm just sort of rummaging.

894
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,704
I'm a vinyl hound. I love this stuff.

895
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,000
Yeah. Hey, Charlie, this is
a good friend of mine, Nigel.

896
01:02:17,175 --> 01:02:18,799
Nigel, Charlie Fineman.

897
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,877
Charlie Fineman, Nigel.

898
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:23,426
Billy Joel, Cold Spring Harbor.

899
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:26,599
They recorded this at too high
of a speed, so it was unreleasable.

900
01:02:26,768 --> 01:02:28,594
Eventually it came out, though.

901
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,846
He grew up two towns away
from where I grew up.

902
01:02:31,022 --> 01:02:33,595
We used to go to the same
White Castle.

903
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:37,147
Say, do you guys wanna
get some lunch after this?

904
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:40,191
Yeah. What do you think, Charlie?

905
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,443
I just wanna stay here.

906
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:46,611
Well, afterwards.
I just thought, you know...

907
01:02:46,788 --> 01:02:49,623
let's go get some lunch with Nigel.

908
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,532
Can I talk to you?

909
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:58,501
I don't wanna eat with that guy.
He's a dork.

910
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,296
I mean, look at him,
he's a giant dork.

911
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:04,138
Looks like a lump of shit
that someone left on the sidewalk.

912
01:03:04,305 --> 01:03:05,716
- Charlie, come on.
- Admit it.

913
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,799
He's a dork.
Tell me he's not a dork.

914
01:03:07,976 --> 01:03:11,060
Charlie, I'm pretty sure
he can hear you.

915
01:03:14,482 --> 01:03:16,522
So, what do you do, Charlie?

916
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,190
I'm a collector.

917
01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:23,027
Really? What do you collect?

918
01:03:23,741 --> 01:03:26,030
What do I collect?

919
01:03:26,244 --> 01:03:29,245
I don't know.
Johnson, you can answer for me.

920
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:30,742
What do I collect?

921
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:35,578
Charlie collects things from his life.

922
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:40,581
You know, things that he finds
germane to his lifestyle.

923
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,421
And how would you describe
your lifestyle, Charlie?

924
01:03:46,764 --> 01:03:50,892
I noticed in the record store, you were
holding up a Bob Seger album.

925
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,852
Are you a Seger man, Nigel?

926
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,595
Love Seger, yes.

927
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,805
Yeah.

928
01:03:56,983 --> 01:03:59,556
Smokin' O.P. 's, Mongrel.

929
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,064
When'd you get into him?

930
01:04:02,363 --> 01:04:03,561
Probably later.

931
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,028
Silver Bullet or Seger System?

932
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,448
Well, actually, I don't like
either of those albums.

933
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:12,622
That's funny, because they're
not albums. Those are his bands.

934
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:17,084
Seger's an artist. A genius.

935
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,495
An American original.

936
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:21,214
And what are you, Nigel?

937
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:23,790
A therapist? Is that it?

938
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:26,720
You sizing me up? You on the
case now? You gonna fix me?

939
01:04:26,888 --> 01:04:30,387
No, look, I was out for a nice
afternoon, I ran into my old friend...

940
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:33,310
Oh, bullshit.
You stink like a shrink.

941
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,972
You got shrink hands.

942
01:04:35,146 --> 01:04:37,602
- You ordered your salad like a shrink.
- Okay.

943
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:41,309
- Let's stop. This was my mistake.
- No, this is good.

944
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:44,190
- How does a shrink order a salad?
- Don't, Nigel.

945
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:46,819
- In your opinion. I'd like to know.
- Let's go outside.

946
01:04:46,991 --> 01:04:49,613
I'm gonna beat your ass.
I will beat your ass, shrink-wrap.

947
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:53,119
Seger fan. You'd get your ass kicked
at a fucking Seger concert.

948
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,661
- Charlie.
- Get the fuck up! Get up!

949
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:59,000
I made you in the record store
the minute I saw your dorky face.

950
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,333
Outside!

951
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:02,332
Okay, Charlie, calm down.

952
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,009
You liar.

953
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,425
Hey.

954
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:54,093
Hey.

955
01:05:58,646 --> 01:06:01,054
The girls still at gymnastics?

956
01:06:01,941 --> 01:06:03,400
Yep.

957
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,106
I'm gonna go wash up.

958
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:11,068
I made dinner.

959
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:13,650
Where were you, at Charlie's?

960
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,041
You know what the whole problem is?

961
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,580
This whole Charlie problem?

962
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,158
You're jealous of him.

963
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:24,914
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

964
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:27,627
I have a friend, I'm spending time
away from the house...

965
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,754
and it's got your feathers ruffled.
You are jealous of Charlie.

966
01:06:30,928 --> 01:06:32,838
I actually think
you're jealous of Charlie.

967
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:36,181
He's caught up in this world of pain,
thick like quicksand...

968
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:39,435
and your only response
is to covet his freedom.

969
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:40,766
That is sick, Janeane.

970
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:43,264
- Is it?
- What, I'm jealous of that?

971
01:06:43,441 --> 01:06:46,110
Just because the guy can, what,
do whatever he wants now...

972
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:48,982
and he's got the freedom to just...

973
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:51,776
I mean, you think I'm jealous of that?
I covet that?

974
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,405
You need to check yourself.
That is... That's sick.

975
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,071
What happened to that woman?

976
01:06:56,287 --> 01:06:58,280
The one that wanted to go down on you?

977
01:06:58,456 --> 01:07:01,659
I talked to Melanie at the office,
and she said you made it go away.

978
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:04,752
- Wait a minute. You called Melanie?
- Yes, I did.

979
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,830
So you're checking up
on me now, Janeane?

980
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:10,541
Alan, I gotta talk to somebody,
because you're not talking to me.

981
01:07:10,718 --> 01:07:13,755
- She's right. I made it go away.
- I'd like to know how you did that.

982
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,757
I invited the woman in,
I shut the door...

983
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:18,138
I hopped on the desk
and I just let her do it.

984
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:19,887
That's real mature, Alan.

985
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:21,852
Well, listen to what
you're saying to me.

986
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:25,106
What are you insinuating?
You don't know me better than that?

987
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,226
I'm gonna go take a walk.

988
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:29,648
Say hi to Charlie.

989
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:31,067
Don't do that. Don't.

990
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:33,113
Don't act like you know what I'm...

991
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:34,825
Did I say I was going to Charlie's?

992
01:07:34,993 --> 01:07:38,408
Don't do that.
You're not in my head.

993
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,122
Send him my love.

994
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,830
See? You want...

995
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:46,453
And if I... Then....

996
01:07:48,339 --> 01:07:49,798
Okay.

997
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:51,543
Okay.

998
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:59,013
Charlie Fineman to see Dr. Johnson.

999
01:08:08,026 --> 01:08:10,517
- Did you wanna talk, Charlie?
- I'll wait. It's private.

1000
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:14,028
Oh, well, you can speak freely.
I mean, this one's totally knocked out.

1001
01:08:14,198 --> 01:08:15,858
She's a thousand miles away.

1002
01:08:16,034 --> 01:08:18,904
And Anna's from Guatemala.
She just got to this country recently.

1003
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:20,786
She doesn't even speak English.

1004
01:08:20,955 --> 01:08:23,707
Anna, Charlie's a superhero
from outer space...

1005
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:27,244
and he stuffs the front of his tights
with a sock.

1006
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:31,381
You are very nice.

1007
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:34,381
See? Privacy.

1008
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:45,183
I was thinking about it,
and you were right.

1009
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,396
I do need to get some help.

1010
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:51,109
- I wanna get help.
- That's great.

1011
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:56,782
Yeah. I just... I gotta be
really careful, though, I don't...

1012
01:08:57,575 --> 01:09:00,066
I just know I'm better off
not having certain thoughts.

1013
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:01,573
You're doing the right thing...

1014
01:09:01,746 --> 01:09:04,035
because you need help
to process those thoughts.

1015
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,413
Well, I don't want it to be
that bozo Nigel.

1016
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:08,411
- No.
- He's a dork.

1017
01:09:08,586 --> 01:09:10,828
He's the biggest dork I've ever seen.

1018
01:09:11,005 --> 01:09:12,464
- Yeah, I get it.
- All right.

1019
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:13,746
I get it.

1020
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,011
That was seriously fucked up, Alan.

1021
01:09:24,185 --> 01:09:26,854
I didn't know he was
gonna say all that shit.

1022
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:36,023
Angela?

1023
01:09:36,197 --> 01:09:38,106
- Hi.
- Hey.

1024
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:41,694
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you. You?

1025
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:44,111
- Good. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1026
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:47,622
Charlie, this is Angela. Angela, this is
Charlie. He's my college roommate.

1027
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,998
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

1028
01:09:53,298 --> 01:09:57,129
Well, thanks for seeing us
on such short notice.

1029
01:09:57,302 --> 01:10:00,137
Why don't you guys come in
and make yourselves comfortable?

1030
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:02,381
I was just gonna grab a coffee.
Anyone?

1031
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:03,588
No, I'm good.

1032
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,225
Charlie?

1033
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,558
Are you kidding me? She's a baby.

1034
01:10:09,731 --> 01:10:11,273
Listen, you're right. She's young.

1035
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:14,857
But she's good. A lot of experience
with loss and grief counselling.

1036
01:10:15,028 --> 01:10:17,566
She's got nice tits. That's not good.

1037
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:19,530
Since when?

1038
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,028
Good point.

1039
01:10:22,201 --> 01:10:24,739
We'll do the meet-and-greet,
you'll see what you think...

1040
01:10:24,912 --> 01:10:26,490
if you like her, we go from there.

1041
01:10:26,664 --> 01:10:29,665
- Am I wrong about her tits?
- No, you're right. They're wonderful.

1042
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:32,622
So, what are you guys talking about?
What's so wonderful?

1043
01:10:45,183 --> 01:10:46,594
Well, think about it, Charlie...

1044
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:51,180
and call me or have Alan call me
and we'll schedule something.

1045
01:10:51,356 --> 01:10:52,684
- Donna, hi.
- I'm early.

1046
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:55,265
- Yeah.
- Dr. Johnson. How are you?

1047
01:10:55,443 --> 01:10:56,937
- I'm fine.
- I'm early.

1048
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:58,736
Okay.

1049
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:03,569
Oh, Donna, this is Charlie.
You remember Donna, right?

1050
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:05,118
She's early.

1051
01:11:05,286 --> 01:11:07,362
- Hi.
- We were just wrapping up.

1052
01:11:07,538 --> 01:11:11,999
- Are you a patient of Angela's?
- I didn't agree to that yet.

1053
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:13,700
But you are.

1054
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:16,999
And it's because you're her....

1055
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:18,632
And you two are....

1056
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,045
- Yes.
- We should get started.

1057
01:11:20,218 --> 01:11:22,460
- And we have a session now, so...
- Let's get going.

1058
01:11:22,637 --> 01:11:24,879
We should get started.
I'm sorry about the overlap.

1059
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:27,049
Charlie, nice to meet you.
Alan, thank you.

1060
01:11:27,225 --> 01:11:30,676
Better bring out the big guns for this
one. She's crazy with a side of crazy.

1061
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,561
- Bye.
- Just saying. Protect yourself.

1062
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:37,400
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1063
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:41,020
Just make sure they never
schedule me near that girl, all right?

1064
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:42,228
I would...

1065
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:45,242
No, it's just, I never wanna
see her again. That's trouble.

1066
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,868
She's too good-looking, I just...

1067
01:11:48,329 --> 01:11:53,075
Nobody has a right to look that good.
It's trouble for everybody.

1068
01:11:53,334 --> 01:11:55,457
Okay, Charlie.

1069
01:12:01,592 --> 01:12:05,590
So have you thought at all about
what you'd like to talk about today?

1070
01:12:05,763 --> 01:12:07,174
And how you wanna start this?

1071
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:08,926
Not really.

1072
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,220
I don't know. I'm good.

1073
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,426
You're good?

1074
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:15,229
I'm okay.

1075
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:16,857
That's good.

1076
01:12:17,984 --> 01:12:19,858
What makes you okay?

1077
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,856
I don't know.

1078
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:27,737
Can I just say something?
You're too young. You're a baby.

1079
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:30,493
I can't do this.

1080
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:34,125
What can I do to help you, Charlie?

1081
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:37,496
How can someone like me help you?

1082
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:44,004
I have these things...

1083
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:47,928
that I don't like to think about.

1084
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:54,970
You're too young. You're too young.
I can't do this.

1085
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:57,719
I gotta put these back on.

1086
01:12:57,899 --> 01:12:59,642
That's okay.

1087
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:47,874
So how are you, Charlie?
How was your week?

1088
01:16:48,588 --> 01:16:50,047
It was good.

1089
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:54,046
Except I was angry.

1090
01:16:54,886 --> 01:16:57,341
- I was pretty mad.
- Who were you mad at?

1091
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,471
I was mad at you.

1092
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:03,555
- I didn't really wanna come back here.
- Why didn't you wanna come back?

1093
01:17:03,728 --> 01:17:07,560
Well, you know why. Every week,
you try to make me do it again.

1094
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:11,566
What do I try to make you do, Charlie?

1095
01:17:11,736 --> 01:17:14,607
Talk about things
I don't wanna talk about.

1096
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:18,232
Well, for the last few weeks, you've
been saying you were getting ready...

1097
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:21,825
- ...to talk about some of those...
- No, goddamn it, that was you!

1098
01:17:21,996 --> 01:17:24,203
I didn't say that, you did!

1099
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:27,707
I don't wanna talk about those things.
I don't remember.

1100
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:29,867
I'm sorry.

1101
01:17:30,755 --> 01:17:34,705
I'm glad you came in,
even though you were mad at me.

1102
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,505
Yeah. I am too.

1103
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,423
Can I say something, Charlie?

1104
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:44,930
- Yeah.
- It might make you mad again.

1105
01:17:45,103 --> 01:17:46,645
No.

1106
01:17:47,271 --> 01:17:48,730
Go.

1107
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:53,100
There is no point
in you coming here every week...

1108
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:55,603
if we eventually
don't discuss your life...

1109
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,938
and discuss your family.

1110
01:18:00,994 --> 01:18:02,785
Is this session over yet?

1111
01:18:03,788 --> 01:18:05,615
No, it just started.

1112
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,415
Can it be?

1113
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,960
If you want it to be, yes.

1114
01:18:15,383 --> 01:18:19,796
Charlie, before you go, I'd just...
I'd like to say something.

1115
01:18:20,722 --> 01:18:24,766
Look, the fact is you had a family...

1116
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:26,886
and you suffered a great loss...

1117
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:32,472
and until you can discuss that
and we can really talk about that...

1118
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:36,899
this is all just an exercise.

1119
01:18:37,155 --> 01:18:38,779
I can be patient, Charlie...

1120
01:18:40,658 --> 01:18:44,074
but you need
to tell someone your story.

1121
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:49,994
It doesn't have to be me, but someone.

1122
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:16,181
Charlie, wait a second. You didn't tell
me that this guy's partner was black.

1123
01:19:16,361 --> 01:19:18,934
I mean, that makes this
almost bearable.

1124
01:19:20,448 --> 01:19:24,861
Why do they gotta give him
the green V plunge...?

1125
01:19:25,036 --> 01:19:28,286
I mean, that's... Why'd they do that?
That's kind of faggoty.

1126
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,667
I had three daughters.

1127
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:38,836
- I know.
- Gina was 5. She was....

1128
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:41,628
Jenny...

1129
01:19:41,803 --> 01:19:43,712
was 7.

1130
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:45,883
She....

1131
01:19:48,309 --> 01:19:49,685
She liked boys already.

1132
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:55,432
Julie was 9. She was older.

1133
01:19:55,608 --> 01:19:57,648
They all looked alike, Johnson.

1134
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,819
Like Doreen.

1135
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:03,819
Doreen was my wife.

1136
01:20:04,242 --> 01:20:07,575
D.T. That was her nickname.

1137
01:20:07,745 --> 01:20:09,904
Doreen Timpleman.

1138
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:14,791
She had a dog, Spider.
Spider. A poodle.

1139
01:20:17,422 --> 01:20:21,502
They'd wake me up all the time,
Saturday mornings, you know...

1140
01:20:21,676 --> 01:20:24,926
singing Beatles songs
to me, in harmony.

1141
01:20:25,096 --> 01:20:26,923
The four of them.

1142
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,592
So cute.

1143
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,384
So cute.

1144
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:36,440
Doreen never, never judged me.

1145
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:38,227
You know?

1146
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:42,979
Never nagged, like some wives do.

1147
01:20:43,156 --> 01:20:47,153
She just wanted me to
take my shoes off...

1148
01:20:47,327 --> 01:20:51,455
so I didn't wreck the carpet.
That's it.

1149
01:20:57,462 --> 01:21:00,747
Doreen and the girls were very female.

1150
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,298
I was the oddball, you know?

1151
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:09,672
Mr. Man.

1152
01:21:12,727 --> 01:21:15,644
They adored me, Johnson.

1153
01:21:17,482 --> 01:21:21,645
I bet they did.
I know they did, Charlie.

1154
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:24,737
They had long brown hair...

1155
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:31,821
except little Gina.
She kept her hair short, you know.

1156
01:21:32,246 --> 01:21:34,820
To be different from everybody.

1157
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:39,163
She....

1158
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:42,500
She had a birthmark too.

1159
01:21:42,757 --> 01:21:44,963
Looked like a burn...

1160
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:47,334
but it wasn't.

1161
01:21:51,099 --> 01:21:53,506
When she was little,
they said it was gonna go away...

1162
01:21:53,685 --> 01:21:55,761
but it never did.

1163
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:01,559
Jenny. Jenny, this one...

1164
01:22:01,734 --> 01:22:05,020
she wanted to be a gymnast.

1165
01:22:07,573 --> 01:22:09,696
She was such a klutz, though.

1166
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:13,616
I didn't have the heart
to mention it as a problem.

1167
01:22:22,714 --> 01:22:25,169
They went to see...

1168
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:29,209
Doreen's sister, Ellen,
and her girls in Boston...

1169
01:22:29,387 --> 01:22:32,388
and they took Spider because...

1170
01:22:32,807 --> 01:22:35,559
I had to work
and they didn't trust me to feed her.

1171
01:22:35,727 --> 01:22:39,559
But that was a joke, right?
And then...

1172
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,395
we were all going to D.T.'s
little cousin's wedding...

1173
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:47,648
in Los Angeles,
and I was gonna meet them out there.

1174
01:22:47,822 --> 01:22:51,736
The kids wanted to go to Disneyland...

1175
01:22:51,909 --> 01:22:56,156
but they had... They were already
gonna miss a couple days of school...

1176
01:22:56,331 --> 01:22:58,738
so we had to say no.

1177
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,751
You know.

1178
01:23:05,423 --> 01:23:08,958
So I'm going on out to meet them
in Los Angeles.

1179
01:23:09,135 --> 01:23:12,385
And on my way to JFK,
I'm in the taxicab...

1180
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:15,224
and I hear on the radio....

1181
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:26,566
I get there and some man tells me
the plane's from Boston.

1182
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:31,773
Some other guy
says there's two planes.

1183
01:23:35,912 --> 01:23:40,289
Then I go inside the airport
and I'm watching...

1184
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:43,412
I'm watching on the television
and I...

1185
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,205
And I saw it.

1186
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:52,719
I saw it and I felt it at the same time.

1187
01:24:00,853 --> 01:24:04,472
I thought about Gina's birthmark...

1188
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,019
and I...

1189
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:10,185
I felt them burning.

1190
01:24:26,212 --> 01:24:27,671
Can we go?

1191
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:31,337
I wanna go home now.

1192
01:24:36,014 --> 01:24:38,006
I don't like this.

1193
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:41,307
I don't like doing it.

1194
01:24:43,896 --> 01:24:45,806
Remembering.

1195
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:48,516
I don't like remembering.

1196
01:25:20,391 --> 01:25:23,226
New York One has gotten
evidence of a credible terror threat...

1197
01:25:23,394 --> 01:25:25,221
and New York City may be a target.

1198
01:25:25,396 --> 01:25:28,018
As a result, the terror-alert status
has been raised.

1199
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:31,726
City officials are beefing up security
on our subways, buses and airports.

1200
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:34,026
Specifics about the threat
haven't been released.

1201
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:37,482
Cops won't confirm whether there's
a link to the al Qaeda terror group....

1202
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:10,766
For Americans and Iraqis alike...

1203
01:26:10,942 --> 01:26:12,899
today's violent demonstrations...

1204
01:26:13,069 --> 01:26:17,814
were just another long chapter
in the ongoing war on terror.

1205
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:20,612
In Baghdad, a cop...

1206
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:06,842
Charlie?

1207
01:28:07,433 --> 01:28:10,968
Charlie, are you here?

1208
01:28:13,523 --> 01:28:17,473
Lincoln next door called to say that
you were listening to the TV too loud.

1209
01:28:18,444 --> 01:28:21,231
I said you didn't listen
to the TV, but...

1210
01:28:23,157 --> 01:28:24,865
Are you okay?

1211
01:28:25,743 --> 01:28:27,368
Charlie.

1212
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:30,580
Charlie.

1213
01:28:43,928 --> 01:28:45,588
What's wrong with you?

1214
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:19,142
- What are you doing, man?
- You fucking almost hit me.

1215
01:30:19,315 --> 01:30:22,020
- What are you, drunk?
- Are you drunk? You almost hit me.

1216
01:30:22,193 --> 01:30:24,020
Get out of the way
before I run you over.

1217
01:30:24,195 --> 01:30:26,152
You run me over? Come on.
Come run me over.

1218
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:27,769
Come and run me over!

1219
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:29,776
Look out! Get out of the way!

1220
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:32,324
Okay, friend, drop the gun!

1221
01:30:32,787 --> 01:30:36,832
N.Y.P.D.! Drop the gun now!
N.Y.P.D.!

1222
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,992
Drop the gun!
Andrew, where are you, man?

1223
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:41,208
- This guy's crazy!
- It's good.

1224
01:30:41,462 --> 01:30:43,704
- Andrew!
- Just do it. Come on, do it.

1225
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:45,791
- Andrew, where are you?
- Do it.

1226
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:48,374
- I'm gonna toast him, Andrew!
- Do it.

1227
01:30:51,055 --> 01:30:53,297
- Get him the fuck down!
- Do not move a muscle.

1228
01:30:53,474 --> 01:30:57,223
Don't ever point a gun at me again.
I should've fucking shot you.

1229
01:30:57,395 --> 01:31:00,349
- Get up. Get up.
- Get up on your feet now!

1230
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:02,314
- Against the wall.
- Up against the wall.

1231
01:31:02,483 --> 01:31:06,351
Get the fuck up, you bastard!
What the fuck you think this is?

1232
01:31:07,363 --> 01:31:10,400
Stay the fuck up! Get the fuck up!

1233
01:31:21,085 --> 01:31:25,000
Alan, say hi to Pete Savarino,
Charlie's attorney.

1234
01:31:25,173 --> 01:31:26,548
This is Alan Johnson.

1235
01:31:27,258 --> 01:31:29,298
All the criminal charges
are gonna be dropped.

1236
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:31,592
- That's good.
- The city doesn't wanna make...

1237
01:31:31,763 --> 01:31:33,091
a big case out of this.

1238
01:31:33,264 --> 01:31:36,929
A 9/11 widower gets beat up
by the cops. Doesn't look good.

1239
01:31:37,101 --> 01:31:39,177
So we're gonna go a different way.

1240
01:31:39,354 --> 01:31:42,557
They wanna do a three-day psych
evaluation at Roosevelt Hospital.

1241
01:31:42,732 --> 01:31:44,974
That's standard procedure.

1242
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:47,768
Well, it's better than jail, I guess,
but Jesus...

1243
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,235
Here you go.

1244
01:31:52,408 --> 01:31:54,615
Here, talk to him and
I'll get the paperwork done.

1245
01:31:54,786 --> 01:31:56,363
Okay.

1246
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:15,513
You okay?

1247
01:32:21,896 --> 01:32:24,019
What's gonna happen?

1248
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:29,312
Well, they wanna hold on to you...

1249
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:35,487
for a few days and do
a psych evaluation, you know.

1250
01:32:38,162 --> 01:32:40,321
Angela and I, we're gonna...

1251
01:32:40,498 --> 01:32:43,784
- We're gonna follow you and...
- Okay.

1252
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,123
I'll get you settled in,
make sure everything's all right.

1253
01:32:54,679 --> 01:32:57,170
I'm really sorry, Charlie.
I feel like this is my fault.

1254
01:32:57,348 --> 01:32:59,673
You know, like I pushed you too hard.

1255
01:33:01,519 --> 01:33:03,512
I just wanted you to...

1256
01:33:06,024 --> 01:33:08,515
be better or something, I don't know.

1257
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,944
I'm sorry.

1258
01:33:50,318 --> 01:33:53,568
When you feel uncomfortable,
you let me know, all right?

1259
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,379
- Are you calm?
- I'm good.

1260
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:16,416
But something that you are not doing
has brought him here to this point.

1261
01:34:16,594 --> 01:34:18,670
That's completely irrelevant.

1262
01:34:18,846 --> 01:34:21,931
I will see to it that he has
proper out-post treatment...

1263
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,475
and I will take care of him.

1264
01:34:23,643 --> 01:34:27,094
Please don't tell me how to do my job.
I understand what is needed here.

1265
01:34:27,271 --> 01:34:29,348
I'm not wanting him to....

1266
01:34:40,868 --> 01:34:41,983
Sign out.

1267
01:34:57,302 --> 01:34:59,793
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1268
01:35:19,073 --> 01:35:21,611
Listen, Charlie, there's gonna be a...

1269
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:24,489
A hearing Friday morning.

1270
01:35:25,413 --> 01:35:28,497
The DA's office
wants you back in here.

1271
01:35:30,335 --> 01:35:32,576
They wanna have you committed.

1272
01:35:36,382 --> 01:35:39,798
They wanna have the right
to hold on to you for up to a year.

1273
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:42,009
That's what they're saying.

1274
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:45,673
The hospital staff
is recommending it as well...

1275
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:49,930
and the Timplemans,
they're onboard with it too.

1276
01:35:52,023 --> 01:35:54,016
The Timplemans?

1277
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,702
Can we go get Chinese now?

1278
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:44,362
You know what it is? Janeane and I
are just up under each other too much.

1279
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:46,573
She's always asking me
to open up, you know...

1280
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:49,318
talk to her, and then I do...

1281
01:36:49,497 --> 01:36:53,744
and everything gets so personal,
and the whole thing just goes to shit.

1282
01:36:53,918 --> 01:36:55,247
Yeah.

1283
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:58,670
Says she wants to hear what I have
to say. She doesn't wanna hear it.

1284
01:37:01,467 --> 01:37:05,417
- Well, what do you have to say?
- That I need some air.

1285
01:37:06,431 --> 01:37:07,889
You know?

1286
01:37:08,141 --> 01:37:11,260
I mean, I love her.
I'm still in love with her.

1287
01:37:11,978 --> 01:37:14,895
But, come on, give me some air, man.

1288
01:37:15,606 --> 01:37:19,770
I mean, it's like I'm not even
me anymore. You know?

1289
01:37:21,612 --> 01:37:24,981
I'm not some damn
Siamese twin, I'm me.

1290
01:37:25,158 --> 01:37:28,242
And that shouldn't piss her off.
It's just... It shouldn't.

1291
01:37:28,745 --> 01:37:33,122
You wanna know what I remember
about you from college?

1292
01:37:35,335 --> 01:37:38,252
Nobody ever gave you any shit.

1293
01:37:39,589 --> 01:37:42,080
You didn't take shit from anybody.

1294
01:37:46,054 --> 01:37:47,678
You know what else?

1295
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:53,222
I hate what I do.
You know, the money's good.

1296
01:37:53,394 --> 01:37:56,977
But I swear to God, I hate putting
phoney teeth on phoney people.

1297
01:37:57,148 --> 01:38:01,098
But don't get me wrong. I'm a dentist,
and when people need it, that's great.

1298
01:38:01,277 --> 01:38:02,937
I feel for them.
But some assholes...

1299
01:38:03,112 --> 01:38:05,235
I just wanna slap them
in the head and say:

1300
01:38:05,406 --> 01:38:07,280
"Get your ass out on the street."
You know?

1301
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:10,949
"There's a lot worse things
to worry about than your teeth."

1302
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,800
So, what's going on with this...

1303
01:38:28,346 --> 01:38:31,347
kitchen-remodelling thing?
What's up with that?

1304
01:38:31,683 --> 01:38:34,352
What else could you do
besides veneers?

1305
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:38,101
No, no. Don't change the subject.
What's going on with that?

1306
01:38:38,272 --> 01:38:42,270
Come on, tell me.
What's up with the kitchen thing?

1307
01:38:45,196 --> 01:38:46,607
Tell me.

1308
01:38:50,493 --> 01:38:54,158
The last time I spoke to Doreen...

1309
01:38:58,584 --> 01:39:01,835
she was at the airport in Boston.

1310
01:39:03,965 --> 01:39:05,625
She wanted...

1311
01:39:07,135 --> 01:39:10,468
Wanted to talk to me...

1312
01:39:11,889 --> 01:39:13,384
about the kitchen remodel...

1313
01:39:13,558 --> 01:39:18,896
that she and the girls wanted to do.

1314
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:22,563
And I was busy,
running out the door...

1315
01:39:28,072 --> 01:39:31,572
and I fucking snapped at her.

1316
01:39:36,247 --> 01:39:40,708
Oh, man, the last time
I fucking spoke to her.

1317
01:39:45,632 --> 01:39:48,301
I hated kitchen talk.

1318
01:39:54,807 --> 01:39:57,014
I think you gotta let that go, Charlie.

1319
01:40:00,438 --> 01:40:03,439
I'm sure you said a lot of nice shit
to her before then, man.

1320
01:40:06,903 --> 01:40:09,441
It's one thing, man. Just let it go.

1321
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,868
- Yeah?
- Hell, yeah.

1322
01:40:21,626 --> 01:40:23,951
Are you gonna be all right, Charlie?

1323
01:40:26,047 --> 01:40:27,292
You're gonna make it, right?

1324
01:40:32,303 --> 01:40:35,138
I'm more worried about you, Johnson.

1325
01:40:42,188 --> 01:40:44,726
I'm more worried about you.

1326
01:40:56,035 --> 01:41:00,911
If you listen carefully, you'll be able
to hear assholes puckering, okay?

1327
01:41:01,082 --> 01:41:02,825
Go, go, go.

1328
01:41:08,172 --> 01:41:09,370
Hello.

1329
01:41:09,549 --> 01:41:11,292
Listen up.

1330
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:15,376
If I ever happen to get into a situation
with a patient again...

1331
01:41:15,555 --> 01:41:17,678
I don't care what it does
to our liability...

1332
01:41:17,849 --> 01:41:20,422
you know what you're gonna do?
You're gonna back me up.

1333
01:41:20,893 --> 01:41:22,352
I put this practise together...

1334
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:25,355
and I made you all
filthy stinking rich.

1335
01:41:25,523 --> 01:41:27,017
Especially you, Stelter.

1336
01:41:28,693 --> 01:41:32,062
Got a problem with what I'm saying,
take your ass back to Brooklyn...

1337
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:34,314
and get whacked around
with insurance cases.

1338
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:36,613
That's it. I'm sick of playing
with candy-asses.

1339
01:41:36,784 --> 01:41:40,485
You know, Alan, I really think
this is inappropriate.

1340
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:42,699
I don't care what you think.

1341
01:41:42,874 --> 01:41:46,243
This isn't a discussion.
It's a warning.

1342
01:41:46,419 --> 01:41:48,542
There's gonna be some changes
made around here...

1343
01:41:48,713 --> 01:41:50,373
and you may not all make the cut.

1344
01:41:57,847 --> 01:41:58,878
As you were.

1345
01:42:01,684 --> 01:42:03,891
The new champ.

1346
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,011
No, no. You were in there with me.
It's what you said.

1347
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:10,606
See, that's the old college Johnson.
That's taking-no-shit Johnson.

1348
01:42:10,777 --> 01:42:12,568
I gotta....

1349
01:42:12,737 --> 01:42:17,565
Unfortunately, I think I was
thinking about another guy we know.

1350
01:42:17,742 --> 01:42:20,067
Handleman, Andrew Handleman.

1351
01:42:20,244 --> 01:42:22,403
- He didn't take shit from nobody.
- Oh, yeah.

1352
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,739
You used to take shit
from everybody, though.

1353
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:26,410
Remember that?

1354
01:42:26,584 --> 01:42:29,918
But you were great in this one.
That was fun.

1355
01:42:39,555 --> 01:42:42,473
What were the combined findings
of the hospital staff?

1356
01:42:43,726 --> 01:42:47,095
The staff did find Charles Fineman
victim to severe symptoms...

1357
01:42:47,397 --> 01:42:49,555
of post-traumatic stress disorder...

1358
01:42:49,732 --> 01:42:52,935
as well as delusional tendencies
related to that...

1359
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:55,150
and an incapability to function...

1360
01:42:55,321 --> 01:42:57,646
in anything resembling
a normal adult manner.

1361
01:42:57,824 --> 01:43:02,201
And do you think remanding him
to the hospital for up to a year...

1362
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:03,781
would benefit Dr. Fineman?

1363
01:43:04,831 --> 01:43:06,076
Yes, I do.

1364
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:09,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Bale.

1365
01:43:10,128 --> 01:43:11,622
You may step down.

1366
01:43:11,796 --> 01:43:14,999
I disagree strongly with that finding.

1367
01:43:15,633 --> 01:43:20,544
Your Honour, I think that Charlie
needs to find his own way.

1368
01:43:20,722 --> 01:43:23,260
Not on our time,
but on Charlie's time.

1369
01:43:23,558 --> 01:43:25,634
And I think that will happen.

1370
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:28,348
He'll find people
that will fill his life again.

1371
01:43:28,521 --> 01:43:31,557
Not today, but soon. Slowly.

1372
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:34,109
Can I just ask a question...

1373
01:43:34,277 --> 01:43:37,812
about your life experience
in regard to this long-term illness?

1374
01:43:39,115 --> 01:43:40,657
I'm curious. How old are you?

1375
01:43:41,659 --> 01:43:43,451
What does that have to do
with anything?

1376
01:43:43,619 --> 01:43:45,778
- Dr. Fineman...
- That question sucks, Your Honour.

1377
01:43:45,955 --> 01:43:49,371
- It's actually a good question.
- No, no, no, it sucks. It sucks.

1378
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:51,831
You know, we're gonna talk about age.

1379
01:43:52,003 --> 01:43:53,995
He's gotta go to
Little League practise soon.

1380
01:43:54,881 --> 01:43:56,920
Dr. Fineman.

1381
01:43:57,508 --> 01:44:01,174
Mr. Fallon, the question's specious.
It demeans the court.

1382
01:44:01,888 --> 01:44:05,221
You don't need to address it,
Dr. Oakhurst.

1383
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:09,175
He wouldn't talk about them
from that day on, any of them.

1384
01:44:10,355 --> 01:44:13,225
Then he cut us off.
He wouldn't take my calls.

1385
01:44:13,399 --> 01:44:15,855
He wouldn't take our calls.

1386
01:44:16,694 --> 01:44:20,359
You know, this has destroyed
my wife a second time...

1387
01:44:20,698 --> 01:44:22,691
what's happening here with Charlie.

1388
01:44:23,368 --> 01:44:25,111
She couldn't even
take the stand today.

1389
01:44:25,703 --> 01:44:28,490
This has been awfully hard on her.

1390
01:44:28,915 --> 01:44:32,865
Tell me about what happened
the last time Charlie was over.

1391
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:36,744
We wanted to show him some
pictures of the girls, some photos.

1392
01:44:36,923 --> 01:44:41,384
It was very, very hard.
We wanted to give them to him.

1393
01:44:41,552 --> 01:44:43,711
And what happened
when you showed him the photos?

1394
01:44:44,097 --> 01:44:47,216
Charlie broke a beautiful lamp
of Ginger's.

1395
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:50,558
It was one of a set. We gave
the other to our daughter. It was...

1396
01:44:50,728 --> 01:44:53,729
How long are we gonna
talk about this lamp? Goddamn it.

1397
01:44:53,898 --> 01:44:56,306
It was a lamp. Let it go already.

1398
01:44:56,484 --> 01:44:58,607
- It's more than a lamp, Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

1399
01:44:58,778 --> 01:45:01,234
It was a hell of a lot
more than a lamp.

1400
01:45:01,406 --> 01:45:04,822
- Just stop it already. Just stop it.
- Okay, okay. Enough.

1401
01:45:05,827 --> 01:45:08,697
That's one. Both of you...

1402
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:10,531
that's one.

1403
01:45:10,707 --> 01:45:11,786
Mrs. Timpleman, sit down.

1404
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:14,745
He knows damn well
what that fricking lamp meant to me.

1405
01:45:14,919 --> 01:45:16,912
Sit down.

1406
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,595
Go on.

1407
01:45:25,763 --> 01:45:29,595
Do you carry any pictures
of your grandchildren, Jonathan?

1408
01:45:29,767 --> 01:45:31,226
In my wallet, yes, of course I do.

1409
01:45:31,394 --> 01:45:33,221
Of course he does.
What is he, an animal?

1410
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:36,017
Oh, ma'am, please stop.

1411
01:45:43,906 --> 01:45:47,951
Are these photographs copies...

1412
01:45:48,328 --> 01:45:51,578
of the same photographs
that you carry with you every day?

1413
01:45:51,748 --> 01:45:53,123
Yes.

1414
01:45:53,291 --> 01:45:55,367
And what was this little angel's name?

1415
01:45:57,462 --> 01:45:58,956
This is Gina.

1416
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:02,131
She was 5. She was a little doll.

1417
01:46:02,925 --> 01:46:05,214
And this is little Jenny.

1418
01:46:06,804 --> 01:46:08,797
She was quite a little chess player.

1419
01:46:08,973 --> 01:46:10,551
She got that from me.

1420
01:46:11,726 --> 01:46:15,059
Jenny wanted to join a tournament,
so I signed her up and we went.

1421
01:46:17,273 --> 01:46:18,304
And that photograph...

1422
01:46:18,483 --> 01:46:20,938
that's you and her
at a chess tournament together?

1423
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,521
Yes.

1424
01:46:25,615 --> 01:46:29,363
- And this?
- This is all of us at the Cape.

1425
01:46:31,704 --> 01:46:33,080
And this photograph.

1426
01:46:33,247 --> 01:46:36,165
- This is your daughter Doreen here?
- Yes.

1427
01:46:41,464 --> 01:46:43,421
And this photograph...

1428
01:46:44,592 --> 01:46:46,917
this is all four of them?

1429
01:46:47,095 --> 01:46:48,470
Yes.

1430
01:46:48,638 --> 01:46:50,547
All four of them.

1431
01:46:55,269 --> 01:46:57,476
Dr. Fineman.

1432
01:46:58,898 --> 01:47:01,852
Dr. Fineman. That's two.

1433
01:47:05,863 --> 01:47:07,856
I bet you miss them.

1434
01:47:08,032 --> 01:47:12,196
I think about them all day.
Every day of my life.

1435
01:47:12,787 --> 01:47:14,993
I don't understand
how anyone could not.

1436
01:47:16,499 --> 01:47:17,614
Dr. Fineman.

1437
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,709
I have no further questions,
Your Honour.

1438
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,712
- Your Honour, you gonna allow this?
- That's three.

1439
01:47:30,305 --> 01:47:31,384
Bailiff.

1440
01:47:31,556 --> 01:47:33,714
Take him out to the hallway.

1441
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:35,516
Just let the guy...

1442
01:47:35,685 --> 01:47:38,354
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Hey, come on.

1443
01:47:38,521 --> 01:47:39,766
Hey, take it easy.

1444
01:47:39,939 --> 01:47:42,015
Take it easy with him.

1445
01:47:43,818 --> 01:47:45,561
I'm right here, Charlie.

1446
01:47:45,737 --> 01:47:49,022
Charlie, I'm right here.
Charlie, I'm right here.

1447
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:53,902
Clear the court.

1448
01:47:56,122 --> 01:47:59,076
I wanna see counsel for both sides
and the Timplemans...

1449
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:02,334
in my chambers in 20 minutes.

1450
01:48:07,675 --> 01:48:10,131
This is a mess.

1451
01:48:11,054 --> 01:48:15,716
First off, you ever pull crap like that
in my court again...

1452
01:48:15,892 --> 01:48:19,177
I will have hardened inmates
using you as a dress-up doll.

1453
01:48:19,354 --> 01:48:21,014
- Hear me?
- Your Honour, in my defence...

1454
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:22,600
Quiet.

1455
01:48:26,194 --> 01:48:28,186
You know something?

1456
01:48:29,113 --> 01:48:31,865
The more I think about
this damn case...

1457
01:48:32,784 --> 01:48:35,191
the more I realise
that this is a family matter.

1458
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:39,070
This is not something that
the state should be deciding upon.

1459
01:48:39,248 --> 01:48:41,455
- Your Honour...
- Shut up.

1460
01:48:46,965 --> 01:48:48,791
I'm serious.

1461
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,586
I want you to shut up, Mr. Fallon.

1462
01:48:52,762 --> 01:48:56,012
This is not going well for you,
you hear me?

1463
01:48:56,182 --> 01:48:57,807
Shut up.

1464
01:48:57,976 --> 01:48:59,221
Yes.

1465
01:48:59,394 --> 01:49:00,722
Shut up.

1466
01:49:05,191 --> 01:49:07,682
Mr. and Mrs. Timpleman...

1467
01:49:09,153 --> 01:49:12,818
this is very serious stuff
we're talking about here.

1468
01:49:13,616 --> 01:49:14,897
I mean, it's easy to see...

1469
01:49:15,076 --> 01:49:18,160
that this man is going through
something very profound.

1470
01:49:19,998 --> 01:49:21,658
It's obvious.

1471
01:49:22,959 --> 01:49:25,746
He may need some hospitalisation.

1472
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,498
He may.

1473
01:49:28,089 --> 01:49:30,331
On the other hand...

1474
01:49:30,508 --> 01:49:32,833
he might just need
to find his own way.

1475
01:49:35,513 --> 01:49:37,173
The fact is...

1476
01:49:37,348 --> 01:49:39,175
you're correct.

1477
01:49:39,809 --> 01:49:42,015
You are the closest thing
he has to family.

1478
01:49:42,812 --> 01:49:45,517
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

1479
01:49:49,277 --> 01:49:51,768
I want you to go home...

1480
01:49:52,405 --> 01:49:55,691
and think very hard this weekend.

1481
01:49:56,576 --> 01:50:00,276
Because we're all gonna meet
back here on Monday morning...

1482
01:50:00,955 --> 01:50:04,122
and I'm going to let
the two of you decide.

1483
01:50:04,876 --> 01:50:07,960
I want you to rack your brains.

1484
01:50:08,546 --> 01:50:11,666
I want you to think about what
your little girl would have you do...

1485
01:50:11,841 --> 01:50:13,798
in this situation.

1486
01:50:16,846 --> 01:50:19,171
And I'm gonna have you
look me straight in the eye...

1487
01:50:19,349 --> 01:50:21,388
on Monday morning...

1488
01:50:22,393 --> 01:50:23,804
and tell me whether or not...

1489
01:50:23,978 --> 01:50:27,561
she would want her man
put away in a place like that.

1490
01:50:30,943 --> 01:50:34,644
You understand what it is
that I am telling you, Mrs. Timpleman?

1491
01:50:36,282 --> 01:50:39,319
The power that I am putting
in your hands.

1492
01:50:39,994 --> 01:50:42,319
Yes. Yes, sir.

1493
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:44,823
Your Honour, can I just say something?
Let me...

1494
01:50:44,999 --> 01:50:46,328
What is his name?

1495
01:50:48,086 --> 01:50:50,209
Bryan Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman.

1496
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,548
Monday morning.

1497
01:50:53,716 --> 01:50:55,424
Ten-thirty.

1498
01:50:56,177 --> 01:50:58,585
Don't bring Sugarman.

1499
01:51:01,808 --> 01:51:04,429
Is Dr. Johnson coming out?

1500
01:51:04,602 --> 01:51:07,639
He's inside with the judge.

1501
01:51:10,108 --> 01:51:11,353
Can I sit down?

1502
01:51:12,986 --> 01:51:15,607
Charlie, can Donna sit down?

1503
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:19,114
She really wanted to come
to your hearing today to support you.

1504
01:51:20,451 --> 01:51:22,574
- Here?
- Yeah.

1505
01:51:23,454 --> 01:51:24,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1506
01:51:25,248 --> 01:51:27,869
On your side. She can sit
on your side, though. All right?

1507
01:51:38,469 --> 01:51:41,969
I don't know how they can't see
that he's just got a broken heart.

1508
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:45,425
It's so broken, his poor heart.

1509
01:51:53,026 --> 01:51:54,057
It's okay.

1510
01:52:18,635 --> 01:52:22,134
I don't need to talk about her
or look at pictures...

1511
01:52:22,305 --> 01:52:25,804
because the truth is,
a lot of times, I see her...

1512
01:52:25,975 --> 01:52:27,968
on the street.

1513
01:52:28,978 --> 01:52:33,058
I walk down the street,
I see her in someone else's face...

1514
01:52:33,232 --> 01:52:36,352
clearer than any of the pictures
you carry with you.

1515
01:52:37,362 --> 01:52:39,568
I get that you're in pain.

1516
01:52:39,739 --> 01:52:42,195
But you got each other.

1517
01:52:42,992 --> 01:52:45,032
You got each other...

1518
01:52:45,203 --> 01:52:48,536
and I'm the one who's gotta
see her and the girls all the time.

1519
01:52:48,706 --> 01:52:51,197
Everywhere I go.

1520
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:56,043
I even see the dog.

1521
01:52:57,048 --> 01:52:59,800
That's how fucked up I still am.

1522
01:52:59,968 --> 01:53:03,550
I look at a German shepherd,
I see our goddamn poodle.

1523
01:53:09,519 --> 01:53:11,096
All right.

1524
01:53:16,359 --> 01:53:17,937
All right.

1525
01:53:56,983 --> 01:53:58,145
What is this?

1526
01:53:58,318 --> 01:54:02,149
He's gone.
The movers finished up an hour ago.

1527
01:54:02,322 --> 01:54:04,943
Didn't even leave a forwarding.

1528
01:54:07,577 --> 01:54:09,700
He just left this.

1529
01:54:10,496 --> 01:54:13,616
He said that this
was to be for you, Ginger.

1530
01:54:21,549 --> 01:54:24,122
Listen, I know
you've both been through hell...

1531
01:54:24,302 --> 01:54:27,469
but shouldn't you
just leave him alone?

1532
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:30,598
We just wanna be part of his life.

1533
01:54:30,767 --> 01:54:33,768
No, I know. I understand,
but it's not an option right now.

1534
01:54:36,731 --> 01:54:38,558
Monday morning,
you need to go in there...

1535
01:54:38,733 --> 01:54:41,022
and just call off the dogs.

1536
01:54:56,918 --> 01:54:58,495
Okay.

1537
01:55:00,755 --> 01:55:02,463
You take care, Adell.

1538
01:55:02,632 --> 01:55:05,633
Thank you for taking care of Charlie.

1539
01:55:05,802 --> 01:55:07,344
Thanks.

1540
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:15,102
- When did he redo the kitchen?
- Oh, God, the kitchen.

1541
01:55:15,269 --> 01:55:18,187
Sixteen thousand times
he did the kitchen.

1542
01:55:19,107 --> 01:55:21,099
It's beautiful.

1543
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:25,443
The girls would love the colour.
They would love this look.

1544
01:55:28,658 --> 01:55:30,900
It's a kitchen, sweetie.

1545
01:55:31,494 --> 01:55:33,036
Come on.

1546
01:55:54,642 --> 01:55:56,884
Can you sign off for me?

1547
01:56:01,524 --> 01:56:02,555
- Hey.
- Thanks.

1548
01:56:02,734 --> 01:56:06,019
This is the last of it. I got a pizza
coming. Could you just send it up?

1549
01:56:06,779 --> 01:56:08,819
Yeah, yeah, we'll send it up.

1550
01:56:23,004 --> 01:56:24,747
You're up.

1551
01:56:25,798 --> 01:56:26,830
Wanna go?

1552
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:29,084
No, no, no. I gotta...

1553
01:56:29,927 --> 01:56:32,050
get back to your spot and get my car.

1554
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:34,843
I'll come and hang out with you
tomorrow for lunch.

1555
01:56:44,317 --> 01:56:47,401
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

1556
01:56:51,783 --> 01:56:55,531
- Anyone order pizza?
- This is the place. Here, I'll take it.

1557
01:56:55,703 --> 01:56:57,447
Come on in.

1558
01:56:59,749 --> 01:57:01,124
Come on in.

1559
01:57:02,585 --> 01:57:04,791
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, I think it's okay.

1560
01:57:07,966 --> 01:57:11,417
- Hi.
- Hey.

1561
01:57:13,763 --> 01:57:15,423
Hey, Charlie...

1562
01:57:16,683 --> 01:57:20,301
you don't mind if Donna stays
and has some pizza, right?

1563
01:57:22,981 --> 01:57:25,816
Oh, yeah, she can stay.

1564
01:57:27,568 --> 01:57:31,068
- There's some plates in the kitchen.
- Thank you, Dr. Johnson.

1565
01:57:31,489 --> 01:57:32,983
For everything.

1566
01:57:36,869 --> 01:57:37,901
Okay.

1567
01:57:47,005 --> 01:57:50,420
I'm gonna take off and I'll catch you
tomorrow, all right, buddy?

1568
01:57:50,591 --> 01:57:52,216
All right, go ahead. You're up.

1569
01:57:52,385 --> 01:57:55,421
- I'm up? I told you, I gotta go...
- You said you wanted to go again.

1570
01:57:55,596 --> 01:57:58,170
I thought you said that.
Don't you wanna go?

1571
01:57:58,349 --> 01:58:01,019
You said you wanted to
take another shot and stick around.

1572
01:58:01,185 --> 01:58:02,680
Yep, that's what I said.

1573
01:58:20,038 --> 01:58:21,864
"Shadows of the Colossus."

1574
01:58:58,076 --> 01:59:00,946
- Hey.
- Hey.

1575
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,742
Where are you?
Did you pick the girls up yet?

1576
01:59:03,915 --> 01:59:05,575
Going right now.

1577
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:07,495
What are you doing?

1578
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:09,661
What do you think I'm doing?
Cooking dinner.

1579
01:59:13,716 --> 01:59:16,468
Janeane, I gotta tell you
something, babe.

1580
01:59:18,638 --> 01:59:22,932
I don't know how I got to the place
where I'm not letting you in...

1581
01:59:23,101 --> 01:59:25,508
but you're right, I'm not.

1582
01:59:25,687 --> 01:59:27,845
And that's wrong.
I gotta open up to you.

1583
01:59:28,564 --> 01:59:30,604
Because I don't wanna be
that guy, baby.

1584
01:59:30,775 --> 01:59:33,266
I don't wanna be that guy.

1585
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:38,189
I don't know if anything I said
even makes any sense, but....

1586
01:59:48,293 --> 01:59:50,119
Alan, just come home. I love you.

1587
01:59:50,295 --> 01:59:52,964
I know I probably don't
tell you that enough, but I do.

1588
01:59:53,923 --> 01:59:55,963
I love you.

1589
01:59:56,467 --> 01:59:59,219
Can you just pick the girls up
and come home?

1590
02:00:00,888 --> 02:00:02,964
I love you too.

1591
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:05,892
I'll be home in a minute, okay?

1592
02:00:09,355 --> 02:00:11,063
You guys left this.

1593
02:00:11,232 --> 02:00:14,067
Don't leave stuff laying around.
I mean it.

1594
02:00:14,736 --> 02:00:18,568
Hey. No, no, no, Kemp.
Take this back upstairs. Kemp.
