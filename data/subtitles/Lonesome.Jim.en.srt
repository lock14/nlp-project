1
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,010
Sorry are you going towards uhh...

2
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,160
Hey.

3
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,191
Hi, Tim.

4
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,250
Jimmy! Oh my goodness.

5
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,715
Donald! Jimmy's here.

6
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,429
What?

7
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:34,887
It's Jim.

8
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:42,676
Come here, let mom look at you.

9
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:51,517
I'm pretty dehydrated. If you don't
mind, I'd like a glass a water. / Okay

10
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,059
What's all the stuff?

11
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,778
We sure did miss you
at Christmas, Jimmy.

12
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,576
You're back now

13
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:02,745
Oh. It's so good see you, Jim.

14
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,911
Mom misses you so much.

15
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:13,998
Jim? Are you okay?

16
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:23,003
Jimmy? Are you Okay?

17
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:25,721
What in the hell?

18
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,020
Jimmy's come
home to surprise us.

19
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,604
What's wrong with him?

20
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:37,107
He said he's dehydrated.

21
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:38,191
Dehydrated?

22
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,222
Well, get him some water.

23
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:40,811
Okay, okay.

24
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:47,522
Hi, Jimbo. How you been?

25
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:55,577
Here you go. Hon... Honey?

26
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,291
I brought you some clean towels.

27
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,380
Ok. Thanks

28
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,851
Lets see. Oh honey that cold.

29
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,510
Its fine mom, I'm fine.

30
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:29,609
Mom sure is happy to see you.

31
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,233
Yeah me too mom.

32
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:38,524
You call so little I worry about my
boy all alone in the big city.

33
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,369
I'm not a boy mom.

34
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:47,528
Yes you are. You are a pretty
boy. You are my pretty boy.

35
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,642
Something wrong, Dad?

36
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,602
No...

37
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,346
This food is great, Mom.

38
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,939
Nothing's wrong. I was just
thinking about your dogs.

39
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,234
My dogs?

40
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,653
Oh, that's what your mom told me
you were doing in New York.

41
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,946
Walking dogs.
Didn't you tell me that, Sally?

42
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,275
I think he does.

43
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,899
They don't need walking anymore?

44
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,696
I'm not planning on
going back to New York.

45
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,069
What are you planning?

46
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,865
I'm not sure.

47
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,797
Your Mom's short a guy in shipping.

48
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,370
Oh, he doesn't want to work with
his mother.

49
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:50,753
She's right.

50
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:53,629
What do you want?

51
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,768
Good-bye.

52
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:15,101
Bye, Tim. Just take your
time, Sweetie. You'll figure it out.

53
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,900
Not too much time.
The boy is nearly thirty.

54
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,113
He's 27, Donald.

55
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,361
Your mom and I started the business
when we were in our twenties.

56
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,946
I was eighteen, Donald.

57
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,133
There you are.

58
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:58,514
Where have you been?
Your mother was trying to call all day.

59
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,184
I was busy.

60
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:08,865
Oh. Well, I just wanted to invite
you to the girls' game.

61
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:09,282
What game?

62
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,242
Lts ok you can't win them all.
Go so Hi to your uncle Jimmy.

63
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,494
Hi, girls.

64
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:14,774
Hi, Uncle Jimmy.

65
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,750
What's wrong?

66
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,210
They lost again.

67
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,748
Their team hasn't scored a point yet.

68
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,331
Your brother's their coach.

69
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,751
What's the problem?

70
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:29,955
We suck.

71
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:34,052
Come here girls.
Grandma give you some ice cream.

72
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:41,555
You want Peanut Brickle or just
plain Vanilla?

73
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:43,266
Can I take the van?

74
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,974
Of course. You need some money?

75
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,393
Sure, I'll fill it up while I'm out.

76
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,138
Tanks full.

77
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:54,903
All right. Well, maybe I'll take a
little something anyway.

78
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:59,694
This is just the money I make
selling snacks at work.

79
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,565
Thanks.

80
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,321
No problem.

81
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:15,050
Hey... Jim? Jim Roush.

82
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:17,717
Hey

83
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:21,841
Hey, guys, look who it is.

84
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,098
Dick.

85
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,716
Can I have a Bud Light?

86
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:53,504
Hey, I was just curious...
What's with all the uniforms?

87
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:55,422
We're nurses.

88
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:05,391
Yeah. I lived across from a
hospital in Manhattan.

89
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,896
Manhattan, New York.

90
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,643
Ever been?

91
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,778
Yeah, its... /its alright...

92
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,657
What'd you do there?

93
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:37,002
Walked dogs. I mean that's what I
did for money. I also write.

94
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,753
Oh yeah, me too.

95
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,088
Really? Wow.

96
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:46,625
Yeah, just for myself though.

97
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:50,806
Well, I like your audience.

98
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,731
You make enough money to live
walking dogs?

99
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,950
I also worked at an Applebee's,
part-time.

100
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,025
I love Applebee's.

101
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:18,863
Oh yeah? My name's Jim.

102
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:20,197
Anika.

103
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,575
Nice to meet you, Anika.

104
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:25,324
You want one?

105
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,166
Sure.

106
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,503
You like working in a hospital?

107
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:41,177
Sure.

108
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,557
You don't find it too antiseptic?

109
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:48,384
Too cold and clean. Uncomfortable.

110
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:55,142
I think hospital beds are more
comfortable than regular beds.

111
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:18,832
Do you have a?

112
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,713
Oh. Yeah. Maybe.

113
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:27,172
Give it to me.

114
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,365
Did you come?

115
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:08,962
Time out.

116
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,721
Okay. We have a minute left in the
half. I'm going to make this easy.

117
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:20,847
Are you listening?

118
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,640
Yes, Coach Tim.

119
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:26,602
Don't take a shot unless you're
sure you can make it. Okay?

120
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,355
Take your time.
Look for an open shot.

121
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,524
But don't shoot it unless you're
positive it's going to go in.

122
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,984
Rachel, don't shoot it at all.

123
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:48,161
All right. One, two, three...

124
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,070
Go Ladders.

125
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,445
I am just miserable anywhere I go.

126
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,153
I'm unhappy too.

127
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:38,987
I just don't know what I'm doing
here. On earth. In this life.

128
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:41,819
You know what the answer is?

129
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:43,907
No.

130
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,463
Nothing. There is no answer.
As far as the world's concerned,

131
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,953
people like me might
as well not even exist.

132
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:56,212
I am really unhappy.

133
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:03,636
I know. If I were you,
I'm not even sure I could do it.

134
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:05,715
Do what?

135
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:12,397
Go on. I mean,
I think about ending it all as it is.

136
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,556
I can't imagine if I had your life.

137
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,604
Why?

138
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:32,164
Well... divorced with a shit job at
a lumber yard after being rejected

139
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:34,322
from the Cromwell police force.

140
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,909
And you wanted to be in the CIA.

141
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,004
I mean, look how far away you are

142
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,839
from everything you wanted to be.

143
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,176
You live with mom and dad
just to cover child support.

144
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:49,720
Making a dollar over
minimum wage at 32 years old.

145
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:50,513
I mean I'm a fuckup.

146
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:52,505
But you, you're a god-damn tragedy.

147
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,513
Yeah.

148
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,497
There's been an accident.

149
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,586
Is Tim okay?

150
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,050
He's in a coma.

151
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:39,762
How?

152
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,220
A car accident.

153
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,553
Who hit him?

154
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,435
A tree.

155
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,726
This isn't your brother's first accident.

156
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:55,854
What do you mean?

157
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,394
Oh, Jimmy.

158
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:16,957
I have to get a drink of water,
does anybody want anything?

159
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,827
Why do you got a plate there, Sally?

160
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,872
I thought I'd set
Tim's place at the table,

161
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,994
just so he knows
we're thinking of him.

162
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,378
Jesus Christ. He's not dead, Sally.

163
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,086
I know, I just...

164
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,963
You want some juice,
Jimmy? I'll get you some juice.

165
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:31,926
Can you help?

166
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:38,651
I said I'd coach the girl's team.

167
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:41,522
Well, we really could use you at
the factory now, too.

168
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,406
Your mom's
having a real hard time with this.

169
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:45,651
And she's already short handed.

170
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:51,996
Oh, jeez. I... I don't know.

171
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:54,949
What's to know?
You either will or you won't.

172
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,123
I guess I'm going to
have to say that I won't.

173
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes you will, god damn it.

174
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:11,001
You hear that, Sally?

175
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:11,845
What?

176
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:14,389
Jim want's to know
if he can come work for you?

177
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,761
No he doesn't.

178
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,346
Yeah... I do, Mom.

179
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:27,349
Well, of course you can.
You know Mom would love your help.

180
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:57,872
Jim, you remember your dad's
brother, Uncle Stacy?

181
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,262
Tim or Jim?

182
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:06,176
Um, Jim... the one not in a coma.

183
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:09,928
He's our little one.
Tim's the oldest.

184
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,604
Something happen to him?

185
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,314
He had an accident.

186
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,065
No one told me.

187
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:18,982
Don probably didn't want to bother
you on your weekend.

188
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:26,866
Uncle Stacy started helping us out
here at work a year or so ago.

189
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,242
He'll get you started.

190
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:32,155
I'm going to use your daddy's
office to call the hospital, ok.

191
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,652
Watch my snacks.

192
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,624
Okay.

193
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,422
Sorry about your brother.

194
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,881
Thanks, Stacy.

195
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,337
Call me Evil.

196
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:50,791
Evil?

197
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:58,347
So, you a... you get high, right?

198
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:01,135
What? No.

199
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:06,643
Yeah, you do.

200
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:09,646
What makes you think that?

201
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,270
First off your mother.

202
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,903
You got to be on tranquilizers
to deal with a bitch like that.

203
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:19,650
Hey. Are you going to
pay for that candy bar?

204
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:23,580
You know what you aughta do is

205
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,162
you oaughta come over to
my trailer during lunch time.

206
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:31,125
I have good stuff. Fuck you up.

207
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:35,582
Hey, Evil, got a snack for me?

208
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:41,844
Oh he's cool. This is my nephew.
Whaddya want?

209
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,884
Give me ten dollars
worth of Nutty Bar.

210
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,183
This'll do ya.

211
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,490
All you have to do
is get in Ten baskets

212
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,028
and then you are free to go home.
Starting now.

213
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:26,346
Hey. Brought you some chips.

214
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,769
Think you might want
to wake up soon?

215
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,434
The girls' need their coach.

216
00:26:42,945 --> 00:26:44,779
Also, Dad's making me
work for Mom

217
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,357
until you snap out of this.
So... Come on,

218
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:57,738
you dumb fuck. Wake up.

219
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,030
What are you doing?

220
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:06,172
Oh, hey. What are you doing?

221
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:08,424
I work here.

222
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:13,304
Have you met my... I mean, this is my
brother. Is he one of your patients?

223
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,296
No. I'm in pediatrics.

224
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:23,395
Jeez, how are you?

225
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:25,802
I'm fine. How's he?

226
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:32,067
Good, good. I mean, he's in a coma.

227
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,643
What happened?

228
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,693
Hit a tree.

229
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,073
I'd hate to see the tree.

230
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,737
I bet you were hoping
never to see me again.

231
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:54,412
What? No, of course not.
What are you doing later?

232
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:56,833
I'm busy.

233
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:58,923
Okay.

234
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,252
I'm free Saturday.

235
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:07,177
Okay. Saturday.

236
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,266
Do you want my number?

237
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:17,856
You already gave it to me.

238
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:19,186
You still have it?

239
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:23,644
Yeah. What is it, again?

240
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,785
I call you

241
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,841
Whenever you pee,

242
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:56,639
you just got to turn it off
and hold it in every couple of seconds.

243
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,259
Like a faucet. You pee in spurts.

244
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:02,847
What's that do?

245
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,274
Teaches it control. You know,
the dick is kind of like a dog.

246
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,515
Can't do anymore
than what you teach it.

247
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:19,528
My cocker spaniel can last a full ten
minutes before spooging down the hole

248
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,112
Ten minutes?

249
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:28,498
Ain't no girl need longer than that
to get her scream on.

250
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,204
Do you have a girlfriend, Evil?

251
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:42,961
Nah, I get hookers. Cheaper.
Want a snack?

252
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:46,670
No thanks.

253
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:50,261
How you like the weed?

254
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:52,799
It's strong.

255
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,511
Yeah, I put a little crack in it.

256
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:02,641
Hey, come check this out.

257
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,276
What?

258
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:18,411
They're dead animal skulls.

259
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:26,831
Hey. Will you open a checking
account for me?

260
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,760
What? / A checking account.

261
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,430
Oh man, I have been banned
from banks for like the next 7 years,

262
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:42,977
and there is a guy down state willing
to sell me a human skull,

263
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,514
but he says all I have
to do is send him a check.

264
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,230
Well, how would it work?

265
00:30:50,942 --> 00:30:53,977
You open an account with my money
and then write the check for me.

266
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,818
Why would I want to do that?

267
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,487
I'd let you write some for yourself.

268
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:10,078
Make up for all those birthdays
and graduations I missed.

269
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,789
There's four grand in there.

270
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,176
Thanks man. Hey, make sure when
they give you those checkbooks

271
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:26,509
you don't get the kind
with kittens or seashells on them.

272
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:28,176
Okay.

273
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:31,683
I just hate those things. Really
pisses me off. They are tacky.

274
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:33,640
I said okay.

275
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,072
Why do you pee like that, Jimmy?

276
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,364
Get out of here.

277
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,200
Is something wrong with your
urinary tract?

278
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,201
What? No. Just get out of here.

279
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:06,921
Oh, Jimmy, I was wondering
if you might watch the girls

280
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,996
while I do some grocery shopping.

281
00:32:11,884 --> 00:32:14,844
I'm sorry,
I sort of have something to do.

282
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,049
Well, okay. That's okay.

283
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:22,762
You always left Tim and me alone.

284
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:27,855
Can I borrow the van?

285
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,396
Of course, Honey.

286
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:33,023
You can just drop me off at the store.

287
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:37,611
Oh, well, I'm not really
going that way...

288
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,104
Never mind.

289
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,784
I could take you
to the end of the way.

290
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:47,484
Oh, no. I'lljust walk.
It'll be good for me.

291
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,528
Thanks, Mom.

292
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:52,000
You need any money?

293
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,162
Oh. No. Actually, I'm good.

294
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,397
Hey there.

295
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:10,856
Are you our date?

296
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:17,314
Mom takes me on
all her first dates.

297
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,654
Your mother and I already
had a first date.

298
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:24,900
When?

299
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:26,275
Last week.

300
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,070
The night she was out until three
in the morning?

301
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:35,699
Ready?

302
00:34:59,522 --> 00:35:01,977
Why is there a bed set up back here?

303
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,612
Do you live in this van?

304
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:08,393
Benjamin.

305
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:13,649
No, I don't live in this van.

306
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:20,955
Wine coolers? Really?

307
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:22,457
What?

308
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,414
Mom's a whiskey woman.

309
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,623
So, where are we going?

310
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:32,674
Where would you like to go?

311
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,845
There's ice skating at the
Glenbrook mall.

312
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:37,626
No.

313
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,468
I know somewhere better.

314
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:02,155
Girls, I'd like you to meet a
friend of mine.

315
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:03,939
This is Ben.

316
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,495
I thought maybe you might want to
show him the trampoline out back.

317
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:10,497
You have a trampoline?

318
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:13,783
No, but our neighbors do.
Take him girls.

319
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:15,502
It's freezing outside.

320
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:16,746
Wear your coats.

321
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,681
You live with your parents?

322
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:39,186
Just temporarily. I'm leaving soon
as my brother recovers.

323
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:45,401
Yeah. I sort of came back
to have a nervous breakdown

324
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:47,060
but the bastard beat me to it.

325
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:49,230
What's wrong with you?

326
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:51,989
Chronic despair.

327
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,999
Hey, what are you kids doing?

328
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,327
Jumping.

329
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,700
Well, who told you, you could jump
on our trampoline?

330
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:08,086
Jim.

331
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,588
He's my uncle.

332
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:11,547
Well, tell your Uncle Jim that he
needs to ask me before...

333
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:14,300
He's not my uncle.
I hardly know him.

334
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,134
He's on a date
with my mother right now.

335
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:17,094
He took Mom up to his room...

336
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,880
Okay, okay. That's fine.
Just ask next time.

337
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:25,601
Where's Benjamin's dad?

338
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:32,439
He's around. He sees Ben every once
a month or so, if he remembers.

339
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,150
And he doesn't have a
problem with you dating?

340
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:42,895
Oh, no. He's incredibly jealous.
Who are all these people?

341
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:45,615
They're all writers.

342
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,066
Oh yeah?

343
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,165
That's Virginia Woolf.
Underneath her is Richard Yates,

344
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:53,290
he's one of my favorites.

345
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,959
What'd he write?

346
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:59,462
Sad stories about sad people with
pathetic dreams.

347
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:02,090
When he died almost all of his
books were out of a print.

348
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,758
That's weird.

349
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:06,843
Then of course there's Poe
and Plath and Buroughs.

350
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:10,138
Thats a writer named
Breece D Pancake.

351
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:12,848
Next to him is Beckett.
Then Dorothy Parker.

352
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,767
The big one is Hemingway.

353
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:18,061
Oh yeah, I read him in high school.
He's good.

354
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:21,188
What did you like about him?

355
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:23,726
I think he had a boner
for what he did, you know?

356
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,278
Yeah.

357
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:32,906
His stories weren't as stuffy and
made up as others. They were realer.

358
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,855
He was a realist.

359
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,487
Maybe that's why.

360
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:38,159
He shot himself in the head.

361
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:39,532
Geez.

362
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:43,618
So did Pancake. That one
threw himself off a bridge.

363
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,034
She put her head in an oven.

364
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:50,452
And that one, that one and
that one all drank themselves to death.

365
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,963
Is Benjamin's dad going to
try and hurt me?

366
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,087
You? No.

367
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:04,433
I thought you said he was
insanely jealous?

368
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,306
He wouldn't be jealous of you.

369
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:08,974
Why not?

370
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:13,522
He just wouldn't.
Besides, we're not dating.

371
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,187
We're not?

372
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,866
Hey could you guys...
could you uh...

373
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,077
Do you have any board games?

374
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,576
Oh god.

375
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,925
I brought you some snacks.

376
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,681
Thanks. Did you bring
any of those Funions?

377
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:58,433
No is that what you wanted, Honey?
But I do have some pork rinds.

378
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:11,983
How you feeling, Tim?

379
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:15,820
Shitty.

380
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:18,407
You're lucky to be alive, boy.

381
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:22,279
I called the girls' mother.
They should be here soon.

382
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:23,915
How are they?

383
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:27,876
Oh, they're good.
I told them to make sure

384
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:31,708
and pray for you every night before
they went to bed.

385
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,078
You had to tell them?

386
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,633
Honey, you know what I mean.

387
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,553
Jesus Christ, Tim.

388
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,423
Donald, he just woke up from a coma.

389
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,130
And why was he in a
coma in the first place?

390
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,139
He had an accident.

391
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:49,431
Is that what happened?
Did he have an accident?

392
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,144
Yeah, I lived.

393
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:56,183
Don't say that.
Don't you dare ever say that.

394
00:40:56,693 --> 00:41:02,646
You're mom's baby. You're my big baby.

395
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:04,937
Oh, God.

396
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:08,357
I'm going to get a drink of water.
You want anything?

397
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:10,817
Nah.

398
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:44,565
Oh. Hey. I was just looking for you.

399
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:45,399
Really?

400
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:45,858
Yeah.

401
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:48,063
Because you smell like you were
just smoking.

402
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,607
Where's mom and dad?

403
00:41:52,864 --> 00:41:54,571
I asked them to leave.

404
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,441
Oh, well how am
I supposed to get home?

405
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,613
I don't know.
We didn't talk about it.

406
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,530
I got to get back to work.
It was nice meeting you, Tim.

407
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,495
Please don't hesitate to ring
me if you need something.

408
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:11,502
You either, liar.

409
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:14,461
See you.

410
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:18,500
She's hot.

411
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:21,929
You think?

412
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,598
Yeah. You have sex with her?

413
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,385
Um, yeah.

414
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:32,640
That's awesome.

415
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:35,596
Thanks.

416
00:42:35,816 --> 00:42:37,559
I meant for me.

417
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:43,853
It means she has no standards.
Bet she'd do it with me too.

418
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,995
Daddy!

419
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:52,026
Girls.

420
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,919
Where's your mother?

421
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:06,540
She's waiting downstairs.

422
00:43:57,008 --> 00:43:58,715
Everything okay, Jim?

423
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,295
Yeah, I was just writing.

424
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:09,680
You see your brother tonight?

425
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,473
He's looking better, don't you think?

426
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:14,720
Yeah.

427
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,064
I love talking to you, Jimmy.

428
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:26,532
How was work for you?

429
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,446
Good.

430
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:30,192
I know you'd rather not be there...

431
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:32,700
It's okay.

432
00:44:32,913 --> 00:44:35,533
Your brother always
refused to work for us...

433
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,280
Really?

434
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,541
Jim. What did we do to make you
kids so unhappy?

435
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:51,715
I don't know.

436
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,922
But what do you think? Be honest.

437
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,346
Your such a smart,
sensitive boy, Jimmy.

438
00:44:57,642 --> 00:44:59,468
I know you must have some opinion.

439
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,895
I don't know, Mom. Maybe some
people just shouldn't be parents.

440
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:11,524
I mean, it's just a thought.

441
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:21,025
Look...

442
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:25,074
No, I'm alright. Just tired.

443
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:34,005
Good night, pretty boy.

444
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:35,333
Good night.

445
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,730
Look cold, want a ride?

446
00:46:06,324 --> 00:46:07,403
On that?

447
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:13,538
I bought it with one of your
checks. Whaddya think?

448
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,486
It's great.

449
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,200
You drive. I'm tripping
my head off right now.

450
00:48:15,347 --> 00:48:16,806
What the fuck was that about?

451
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:17,885
Dunno.

452
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:26,189
Sally has been arrested for using the
company's Fed Ex account to ship drugs

453
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:31,610
They have proof of her signature on
over a dozen packages sent from here

454
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,902
Are you kidding?

455
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:36,447
No I am not kidding does
it sound like I am kidding?

456
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:37,740
Maybe?

457
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,326
Well, I'm not. Now listen,
I'm going down there to explain to

458
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:43,734
these peckerheads that
they got the wrong person.

459
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:47,945
What I need you to do is cover
for your mom and me while I'm gone.

460
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,291
Sure, sure.

461
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:51,828
No problem, Donny.

462
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:55,289
If anyone asks what's going on,
just play dumb.

463
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:05,430
So, who do you think did this?

464
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,514
You.

465
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,348
Me? I can't believe you'd think
that your own...

466
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,434
Cut the bullshit, Evil.
I know it was you.

467
00:49:11,435 --> 00:49:13,811
All right, you got me.

468
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:16,017
How could you be such an idiot?

469
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:25,863
I wrapped everyone of those
packages in foil,

470
00:49:25,864 --> 00:49:27,740
and then I double
plastic bagged them,

471
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,659
and then I'd put a little Big League
Chew in there too, Grape...

472
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,162
They are taking
my mom to PRISON, Evil.

473
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,081
I understand that.

474
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:40,698
But you're not going to rat
out your Uncle Stace now, are you?

475
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:45,171
You think I'd let my mother stay
locked-up for you?

476
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:48,256
I'd be a little nervous to narc-out
a guy with no money

477
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:51,008
after you'd just opened
a four thousand dollar account.

478
00:49:52,344 --> 00:49:53,458
You fucker.

479
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,431
Just be careful when you point a
finger at someone else

480
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:02,760
you are pointing three at
yourself and a thumb to the sky.

481
00:50:05,229 --> 00:50:06,687
What's that mean?

482
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:11,852
That means, is your piss clean?

483
00:50:27,206 --> 00:50:28,415
What are you doing here?

484
00:50:28,415 --> 00:50:29,999
Mom brought me.

485
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,624
What is your mom doing here?

486
00:50:36,797 --> 00:50:37,839
I didn't know that.

487
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,584
There's a lot people don't know
about our Central Intelligence Agency.

488
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:44,303
Sounds so exciting.

489
00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:48,097
It exciting and it's the type of work

490
00:50:48,098 --> 00:50:50,670
you can't help
taking home with you, either.

491
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:54,727
Oh. Hey. Aren't you
home a little early?

492
00:50:56,272 --> 00:50:57,979
Something happened at work.

493
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,769
What's wrong?

494
00:51:00,692 --> 00:51:04,605
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you doing here?

495
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,532
I thought I'd help
your brother get situated.

496
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,868
Did the hospital send you?

497
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,697
No.

498
00:51:16,914 --> 00:51:18,989
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

499
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,663
Oh, yeah, I can see what a favor
you're doing.

500
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:48,439
Hey, you like basketball?

501
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,608
No.

502
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,651
Ever played before?

503
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,570
No.

504
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,601
Want to?

505
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:10,739
Okay. Everybody, this is Ben. Ben
this is Rachel, Sarah and...

506
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:13,376
the rest of the team.

507
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:17,705
Now, why don't you all
grab a ball and start practicing?

508
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:32,976
It's one of my favorites.

509
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:39,429
Well, thanks so much, Sweetie. Mom
is so happy you came down to visit.

510
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:42,349
So, what is this book about?

511
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,100
An impotent man's futile love.

512
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:57,281
Oh... great. Thanks so much,
Sweetheart.

513
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:03,909
So, how is it in here?

514
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:10,419
Oh, it's not so bad.
The women are all very talkative.

515
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,966
I'm sorry about this, Mom.

516
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:19,086
Oh Honey, It's not your fault.

517
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:43,159
The police put a
freeze on our business,

518
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,495
they figured that it was
a drug front.

519
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:49,657
I can't even get into my own company
they got padlocks on the doors.

520
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,745
Your kidding.

521
00:53:58,255 --> 00:54:00,081
There's nothing I can do.

522
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:26,276
A girl's here to see you.

523
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:29,686
Said she's a nurse.
Brought a little kid with her.

524
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,820
He's sitting right next to you, dad.
His name's Ben.

525
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:37,121
Oh. Hi, Ben.

526
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:37,902
Hello.

527
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:43,498
You want to get me another one of
these from the fridge, buddy.

528
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,038
Okay.

529
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:06,139
Hi.

530
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:08,771
Don't you work anymore?

531
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:10,772
It's my day off.

532
00:55:11,232 --> 00:55:15,691
My father and brother are both in
the house and Ben is just downstairs.

533
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:18,070
I didn't come for that.

534
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:19,727
Well why?

535
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,990
I don't know Jim,
I like to help people.

536
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:05,224
Come in.

537
00:56:10,698 --> 00:56:12,239
Oh. You.

538
00:56:12,658 --> 00:56:13,772
Evil.

539
00:56:14,076 --> 00:56:15,356
This is Stacy.

540
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,151
Stacy.

541
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,992
Yeah?

542
00:56:21,832 --> 00:56:23,325
Evil, I have to talk to you.

543
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:32,340
You wanna get in on this I still
got a half hour?

544
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:34,796
The police have seized
my parents' business, Evil.

545
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:43,682
Damn, man. That's too much.
That's... What are you going to do?

546
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,308
What are you going to do?

547
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:49,730
Common there's not a jury in the
world that's going to believe that

548
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,603
that woman is selling drugs.

549
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,347
They will believe a guy like me does.

550
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:56,724
You do, Evil.

551
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,236
See.

552
00:57:00,406 --> 00:57:05,076
There's only one thing to do here,
Evil. And you know what it is.

553
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:10,288
What? Confess and go to jail and
man-rape for the next five years?

554
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:13,458
You make your own choices.

555
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:17,753
Look there's three thousand dollars
left in that account.

556
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:19,797
That'll get you pretty far from here

557
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:23,091
No, I'm not going to
sell my family out.

558
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,549
Look, I'm family too.

559
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:26,006
I can't believe you.

560
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:31,390
Hold on shithead.
That money is in your name

561
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,014
and if you don't give it back to me

562
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:35,382
then it's like you already accepted it.

563
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,021
Make your own choices.

564
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:49,937
Jim Hey.

565
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:53,778
What?

566
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:55,867
It's full.

567
00:57:57,078 --> 00:57:58,026
What's full?

568
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:04,578
Jesus Christ, man. What don't you
get your nurse do this?

569
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:07,917
I couldn't ask her to do that.
That's disgusting.

570
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:10,412
Well, what do you
want me to do with it?

571
00:58:11,048 --> 00:58:11,996
Clean it.

572
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,039
Fuck that.

573
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,466
I need something to pee in.

574
00:58:31,731 --> 00:58:39,737
Okay. Uhhh. Just do
what you want today.

575
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:41,066
I don't know what to tell you.

576
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,835
What kind of coach are you?

577
00:58:58,128 --> 00:58:59,787
Oh. Hey.

578
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:02,788
Your team's not even playing
basketball.

579
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,793
Whatever.

580
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:11,306
You must not think much of your
nieces then. Or Ben.

581
00:59:11,306 --> 00:59:14,600
Or any of those kids out there.

582
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,805
You must not
think much of me, either, I guess.

583
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,595
Oh, I do. I think you're all great.

584
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:28,570
What?

585
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,443
You think I'm great?

586
00:59:31,614 --> 00:59:33,736
Well, sure.

587
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,528
I think you're great.

588
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:45,375
There are so many fun
and cheery people in the world.

589
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:47,783
Don't you think you'd be
better off with one of them?

590
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:50,044
Someone more like yourself?

591
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:53,253
You think I'm fun and cheery?

592
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,164
Of course you are.

593
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:59,262
You just can't stop
complimenting me, can you?

594
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,387
You're missing my point.

595
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:04,337
No, I'm not.
I'm getting it very clearly.

596
01:00:39,796 --> 01:00:42,715
You want to come in?

597
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:44,754
It's okay. I don't mind.

598
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,584
No. I think I'lljust
say good bye here.

599
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:49,925
Okay.

600
01:00:52,056 --> 01:00:53,087
Bye, Ben.

601
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:54,672
Bye.

602
01:00:56,726 --> 01:00:57,805
Bye, Anika.

603
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,895
Good night, Jim.

604
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:05,679
You can kiss if you want.
I don't care.

605
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:10,070
You're kind of apathetic for such a
little guy, aren't you, Ben?

606
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:11,185
Yeah.

607
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:16,070
Good night, you two.

608
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,563
Mom, you're home.

609
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:53,776
Yup.

610
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:55,195
How?

611
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:59,659
Something called bail. One of the
girls in prison told me about it.

612
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:05,788
Apparently your father never
realized it was an option.

613
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:12,254
I called a very nice
bondsman in Kendalville

614
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,211
who put up the money for me.

615
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:16,830
That's great.

616
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:21,304
Oh, honey don't touch that.
It's for Kiki.

617
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:22,263
Who's Kiki?

618
01:03:22,263 --> 01:03:25,346
She's the con that gave me the
number for the bondsman.

619
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,560
I'm going to bring
cobbler to her and all of girls

620
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,303
I made friends with at County.

621
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:33,897
All those ladies were so nice to me.

622
01:03:33,898 --> 01:03:35,475
It's hard to believe
they're criminals.

623
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:40,902
Have you talked to Tim?

624
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:44,653
Oh. Yeah. Same old Tim.

625
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:20,679
I need a fork.

626
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:48,448
My Fork!

627
01:04:53,547 --> 01:05:01,422
Jimmy. Jim. Yoo-hoo. Jimmy.
Wake up. You have visitors.

628
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:03,593
Who?

629
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,629
Get your ass up, Jim.
It's four o' clock.

630
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,019
Sorry to say ass in front of you,
Mrs. Roush.

631
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:12,770
Oh, no. It worked.

632
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:14,470
Hi, Jimmy.

633
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,065
Hi, Mom.

634
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:18,151
You have a nice nap?

635
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:19,193
Yeah.

636
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:22,904
Your little friend, Ben, is helping
me make dinner downstairs.

637
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:25,323
Oh. Ben's here?

638
01:05:25,323 --> 01:05:26,864
We're making goulash.

639
01:05:29,327 --> 01:05:30,820
Jim's my pretty boy.

640
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:40,662
I brought you something.

641
01:05:42,337 --> 01:05:43,285
What?

642
01:05:43,964 --> 01:05:46,584
Don't get too excited, it's not much.

643
01:05:51,678 --> 01:05:52,626
What is it?

644
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,592
A smile, for poor old Hemingway.

645
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:05,147
I don't know.
It doesn't look right to me.

646
01:06:06,149 --> 01:06:08,935
That's because you're used to
seeing it the other way.

647
01:06:10,986 --> 01:06:12,610
The other way is true to life.

648
01:06:13,488 --> 01:06:15,646
The other way is depressing.

649
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:18,772
Like I said...

650
01:06:18,951 --> 01:06:20,231
Oh, Jim.

651
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,240
You smell nice.

652
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:28,619
Thanks.

653
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,421
I like you a lot, Anika.

654
01:06:37,425 --> 01:06:42,595
I like you a lot, too. So does Ben.

655
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:43,295
He does?

656
01:06:43,471 --> 01:06:46,723
Oh my God, he totally looks up to you.

657
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:48,058
Oh no.

658
01:06:48,058 --> 01:06:49,302
It's true.

659
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,886
Ben shouldn't look up to me.

660
01:06:52,062 --> 01:06:53,313
Sure he should.

661
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:54,480
No he shouldn't.

662
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,594
Why?

663
01:06:58,025 --> 01:07:01,108
I think I might of caused my
brother to hurt himself.

664
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:03,226
That's crazy.

665
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:08,693
I told him life was pointless and I
couldn't believe he hadn't killed himself.

666
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,961
So, Anika, I understand you're a nurse.

667
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:24,296
Yes, I am Mrs. Roush.

668
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:25,459
That's great.

669
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,465
I love the work.

670
01:07:28,175 --> 01:07:30,343
So, where'd you two meet?

671
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:31,374
At a bar.

672
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,683
Tim just can't stop saying enough
nice things about you.

673
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:40,685
Oh, how is Tim?
I haven't talked to him today.

674
01:07:40,685 --> 01:07:42,019
Oh he's good.

675
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,729
Benjamin?

676
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:45,397
Yes.

677
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:46,856
Do you go to school yet?

678
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:51,193
He's in third grade.

679
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:54,404
Third grade? But you're so little.

680
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:55,567
You're little.

681
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:56,782
Benjamin.

682
01:07:56,782 --> 01:08:01,369
Anika? As you know
Tim broke both of his legs

683
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,121
so he can't easily
get in and out of bed

684
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:08,207
we got him one
of those crooked plastic bottles for

685
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,459
you know his business,

686
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,753
but its not
quite big enough for his...

687
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:13,666
Mom...

688
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:23,177
To tell you the truth I don't
really like my family that much.

689
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:26,636
What a terrible thing to say.

690
01:08:28,808 --> 01:08:32,018
Its true I mean
I love them all to death,

691
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:35,766
but I just can't stand to be so close.

692
01:08:36,607 --> 01:08:38,812
Well what good is that kind of love?

693
01:08:45,364 --> 01:08:50,826
I'm thinking of leaving.
You know, I was thinking,

694
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:54,610
maybe you and
Ben could come with me.

695
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:57,362
Where?

696
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,120
I don't know.

697
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:01,991
Great. Sounds like a good plan.

698
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:05,003
Where would you like to go?

699
01:09:08,133 --> 01:09:10,208
I can't afford to go anywhere.

700
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:14,220
Sure you can. There are nursing
jobs all over the country.

701
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:15,928
Just pick a place.

702
01:09:18,766 --> 01:09:23,557
Well, you know, I've always wanted
to go to New Orleans.

703
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:26,890
New Orleans. Why New Orleans?

704
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:29,017
Bourbon St.

705
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,437
What's your second choice?

706
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:35,603
Vegas.

707
01:09:36,823 --> 01:09:40,405
I've heard really good things about
New Orleans. Let's try it there first.

708
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:43,280
I can't just up and
move to New Orleans.

709
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:45,489
You can if you do.

710
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,116
What about Ben's dad?

711
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:55,493
He's a deadbeat.
I should be Ben's dad.

712
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,051
You're crazy.

713
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:07,175
Am I?

714
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:26,685
What's this?

715
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,114
It's an Inspector Nestor book.

716
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,951
Remember when you used
to read these to me?

717
01:10:31,952 --> 01:10:35,071
You'd always know how each story was
going to end half way through every book.

718
01:10:35,371 --> 01:10:37,197
They were predictable.

719
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:40,742
Maybe. I could never guess them.

720
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:42,745
You're an idiot.

721
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:45,963
Anyway, I found them in the garage.

722
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:49,331
Thought maybe you could
read em to the girls.

723
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:58,723
They miss you, you know?
The whole team misses you.

724
01:10:58,724 --> 01:10:59,755
Sure.

725
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:01,888
They do.

726
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:06,562
I bet they haven't even noticed.

727
01:11:16,155 --> 01:11:18,313
They're playing their last game
this weekend.

728
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:23,952
Anything you want me to tell the
team at last practice?

729
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:28,029
Tell them to make a fucking basket.

730
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,023
I can't do it.

731
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:10,988
Maybe you can. Maybe you can't.
But you'll never know unless you try.

732
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,160
I've been trying all practice.

733
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:16,235
True.

734
01:12:18,165 --> 01:12:19,445
Hey, you two.

735
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:20,541
Hey.

736
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,919
What gives? I thought practice was
supposed to be over 30 minutes ago

737
01:12:23,919 --> 01:12:27,204
Jim won't let me go
until I make five more baskets.

738
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:30,425
I'm sorry Benjamin.

739
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:32,426
I didn't mean to make
you feel like you couldn't go home

740
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:33,801
if you didn't make the shots.

741
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:35,760
But that's what you said.

742
01:12:36,847 --> 01:12:39,384
Why didn't you call if you knew you
were going to be late?

743
01:12:42,643 --> 01:12:44,185
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was
that big a deal.

744
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:48,514
Yeah, well it is a big deal. Stuff
like that is a very big deal to moms.

745
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,524
What's your problem, Anika?

746
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:56,308
Nothing, Jim.

747
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:00,991
Just, you can't ask a girl
to move 1082 miles away with you

748
01:13:00,992 --> 01:13:03,114
unless you're
really going to follow through.

749
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:10,998
Why wouldn't I follow through?

750
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,331
Because you don't know what it
would be like.

751
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:17,628
What would it be like?

752
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:20,841
Difficult. Very difficult.

753
01:13:23,177 --> 01:13:26,426
Great. I'm used to challenges.

754
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,838
You're use to avoiding them.

755
01:13:30,516 --> 01:13:35,260
Well, maybe I don't want you to.

756
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:44,733
Oh. Okay.

757
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:49,614
I just said maybe.

758
01:13:49,907 --> 01:13:54,117
No, the whole idea was stupid
anyway. Come on Ben.

759
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,863
Come on Anika.

760
01:15:10,182 --> 01:15:11,973
I'd like to make a withdraw please.

761
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:28,943
I need to be on my own.

762
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:34,657
I understand. Sometimes Mom wishes
she could be on her own too.

763
01:15:35,286 --> 01:15:36,530
What?

764
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,528
Nothing. Just kidding.

765
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,282
Where you going to?

766
01:15:47,838 --> 01:15:49,213
Maybe New Orleans.

767
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:56,296
Oh fun. You know Mom's never really
been anywhere.

768
01:15:57,846 --> 01:15:59,043
I know Mom.

769
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,962
Maybe I'll come visit
you after my trial.

770
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,140
Or before, either would be great.

771
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,186
I can't really leave the state until after

772
01:16:13,943 --> 01:16:15,223
Jimmy.

773
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:40,839
All right team,
I know it's been a rough season

774
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,757
Girls... but...

775
01:16:41,758 --> 01:16:43,426
Sorry, I'm late.

776
01:16:43,426 --> 01:16:47,762
No problem, Benjamin.
Is your mom here?

777
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:48,794
No.

778
01:16:56,687 --> 01:17:00,690
Like I said, I know it's been a
rough season for us this year.

779
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:04,234
Not a lot of shots have fallen for us.

780
01:17:04,235 --> 01:17:09,026
In fact not a single shot has
fallen for us in 14 games.

781
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:14,534
So I guess the question
we need to ask ourselves is,

782
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:18,946
are we going to let those 14 games
determine the next one?

783
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:21,915
Because if we are

784
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:25,752
, then we may as welljust go out there
and shake hands with the other team.

785
01:17:25,752 --> 01:17:28,671
Congratulate them on their victory.

786
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:33,049
I see some of you nodding
your heads in agreement right now.

787
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:38,012
By all means, it's not an
altogether absurd idea. Odds are,

788
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:40,965
we are going to lose no matter how
we go about playing this game.

789
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:50,516
So why do we play at all? Well team...

790
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:55,770
I don't really have an answer for that.

791
01:17:58,112 --> 01:17:59,689
And do you know why?

792
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:07,823
Because its a stupid question asked
by a doubtful and unhappy man.

793
01:18:09,622 --> 01:18:14,375
Forget his question.
You just got to keep playing.

794
01:18:14,376 --> 01:18:17,712
Because if you don't you might end
up like him and let me tell you,

795
01:18:17,712 --> 01:18:21,548
he is no fun. Nobody
knows what we're capable of.

796
01:18:21,548 --> 01:18:25,046
The past does not
always predict the future.

797
01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:29,177
Now that team may have seen
us play before

798
01:18:30,264 --> 01:18:32,137
but they've never
seen us play today.

799
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,716
Am I right? / Yeah.

800
01:18:39,772 --> 01:18:41,064
Am I right?

801
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:42,399
Yeah.

802
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:48,602
Well, all right then. Well let's
show them what we can do.

803
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,282
One, two, three. Go Ladders.

804
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,907
Hey, come on. Come over here.

805
01:19:50,872 --> 01:19:56,707
No long faces. That was good.
That was our best game yet.

806
01:19:57,169 --> 01:19:58,283
Shut up, Jim.

807
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,215
Good job, Jimmy.
You make a great coach.

808
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:28,236
Dear Mom
I don't know where to start,

809
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:31,189
so I'lljust begin with the
end and work my way back.

810
01:20:33,324 --> 01:20:37,107
I came home because I ran out of
money and had nowhere else to go.

811
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,786
If I'd had any other option,
I would have taken it.

812
01:20:43,207 --> 01:20:46,657
I did not consider the simple fact
of having a place to return a blessing

813
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:50,542
Instead, I thought of it
as a burden and a symbol of failure.

814
01:20:51,756 --> 01:20:54,590
I'm ashamed to admit that
growing up I pitied you

815
01:20:54,967 --> 01:20:58,344
and what I thought was your naive
belief that our dreams could come true,

816
01:20:58,345 --> 01:21:00,384
simply by virtue of having them.

817
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:10,056
Because the truth, as I witnessed it,
was something completely different.

818
01:21:14,692 --> 01:21:17,986
The truth actually was that nothing
worked out and no one,

819
01:21:17,986 --> 01:21:20,274
anywhere lived the life they wanted.

820
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:30,697
But I see now, that it was
me with the naive belief.

821
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:33,743
I thought if I
resigned myself to disappointment,

822
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:37,372
at least I'd be better off then
those people who tried and failed.

823
01:21:38,253 --> 01:21:40,708
And I hate myself
for only realizing this now

824
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,462
and for taking and taking from you
without giving anything back.

825
01:21:46,093 --> 01:21:49,924
You are one of the few good peaches in
are one of the few good peaches in

826
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:56,925
I promise not to waste anymore time
or take your love for granted again.

827
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:02,102
I love you so much. Jim.

828
01:22:06,693 --> 01:22:10,529
P.S. The money in this
envelope is from Stacy.

829
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:14,228
I figure he owes you at least this
much for all the snacks he's stolen.

830
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,626
And he's the one who's been sending
drugs through the Fed Ex account.

831
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:38,168
Promise to call you soon. Jim

832
01:23:03,573 --> 01:23:04,604
Thirsty?

833
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:15,989
What are you doing here?

834
01:23:18,252 --> 01:23:22,331
Benjamin wanted to apologize to you
for telling you to shut up.

835
01:23:24,507 --> 01:23:25,882
I'm sorry Jim.

836
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:31,091
That's alright, Benjamin.
How'd you find me?

837
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:35,846
We stopped by the house
to see you. Your dad told us.

838
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:41,809
Where you going?

839
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:47,680
New Orleans. / Great.

840
01:23:50,987 --> 01:23:53,524
Benjamin,
do you want to say goodbye to Jim?

841
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:55,695
Bye, Jim.

842
01:23:55,825 --> 01:23:57,568
Bye... Benji.

843
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:04,123
You be good to your mother.

844
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,957
And promise me not to
get too much more apathetic.

845
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,500
At least not until your teens.

846
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:10,872
Okay.

847
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:30,134
It never would have
worked out anyway.

848
01:24:37,234 --> 01:24:38,644
Is that your bus?

849
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:42,893
Yeah.

850
01:24:43,864 --> 01:24:45,571
You better run.

851
01:24:58,668 --> 01:24:59,747
Bye.

852
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:01,539
Bye, Jim.

853
01:25:24,148 --> 01:25:25,523
Stop that, Benji.

854
01:25:34,406 --> 01:25:35,899
Common lets go.

855
01:26:24,656 --> 01:26:27,572
Mom. Stop the car.

856
01:26:42,671 --> 01:26:43,833
Can I get a ride?

857
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,919
Sure.

858
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:24,737
I thought you never ran.
