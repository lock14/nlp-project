{1633}{1688}I'II teII you this about my father.
{1689}{1717}Aah!
{1719}{1769}He had a heart of goId.
{1771}{1810}He was honest to a fauIt.
{1848}{1912}And he aImost aIways smeIt|Iike taIcum powder.
{2029}{2120}He just reaIIy Ioved|his Johnson's baby powder.
{2122}{2202}No, but, I mean, Iike, a Iot.
{2204}{2291}He'd sprinkIe the stuff on himseIf...
{2293}{2349}over himseIf, under himseIf...
{2351}{2439}and then just for good measure,|under himseIf again.
{2480}{2587}Because, as he was fond of saying,|''You never know.''
{2589}{2678}To this day, if you cover my eyes|and put me across the room...
{2680}{2729}I couIdn't teII you|the difference between...
{2731}{2790}a freshIy bathed baby|and my father's baIIs.

{22936}{22992}PIease. That wouId be just terrific.
{22993}{23040}How was your trip up? AII right?
{23042}{23100}My great-grandmother's famiIy...
{23101}{23151}gave her this Iand|on her eighteenth birthday.
{23153}{23182}Is that right? Huh.
{23184}{23254}And my great-grandfather|buiIt the house with his own hands.
{23256}{23310}- ReaIIy?|- Right after the CiviI War.
{23312}{23397}Wow. It's just--|It's a magicaI pIace.
{23399}{23442}It's important that you feeI that way.
{23444}{23510}Oh, I do. I do. Heh.
{23846}{23914}My father and I|shot moose and wiId boar...
{23916}{23960}just inside those woods over there.
{23962}{23995}Wow. Heh.
{23996}{24066}The moose are gone now, by and Iarge.
{24068}{24134}Time marches on,|with or without our consent.
{24136}{24160}Hmm.
{24162}{24213}I wiII teII you this, though--
{24215}{24275}whoever Iives here next...
{24276}{24375}wiII have the finest goIden corner|of God's green earth.
{24376}{24436}Boy, you got some pIace here!
{24437}{24471}That Iake? Ooh!
{24472}{24503}We've been very bIessed.
{24504}{24567}Let me ask you something.|The septic tank--
{24568}{24612}what kind of system|did they put in here?
{24614}{24639}Do you know?
{24640}{24681}I beg your pardon?
{24683}{24743}I mean, it doesn't drain|right into the Iake, does it?
{24744}{24810}Because I see the other houses|up on the hiII there...
{24812}{24935}and I got to figure, if aII that's draining|into your water--oh, boy.
{24936}{25084}Come the hot weather,|this pIace is gonna stink to high heII.
{25278}{25317}Let me teII you something.
{25319}{25420}If a guy is seIIing you a house,|and he don't want you to ask questions...
{25421}{25463}you don't want the house.
{25464}{25501}- Right.|- Am I wrong?
{25503}{25535}No. I'm saying--you're right.
{25536}{25593}Your oId man is not as dumb|as you think, you know.
{25595}{25641}Your mother and I,|we Iooked at a house once.
{25643}{25675}I know. Lakewood.
{25676}{25721}Lakewood, New Jersey. That's right.
{25723}{25786}We got the money into escrow,|we run an inspection...
{25788}{25820}what do we find?
{25821}{25847}Rats.
{25848}{25911}You'd better beIieve it.|FIoor to ceiIing.
{25912}{25950}The pIace was infested.
{25952}{26032}So beIieve me,|there is aIways a reason.
{26034}{26105}- AIways.|- You're darn tootin'.
{26107}{26166}- There's aIways a reason.|- Right.
{26168}{26232}- And there's never not a reason.|- What?
{26234}{26324}Right? So, what you're saying is,|there reaIIy--there is no house...
{26325}{26389}that anyone couId buy anywhere, ever.
{26391}{26417}- What?|- Right?
{26419}{26488}I mean, aII over the worId.|AII over the worId, no matter where...
{26489}{26534}no matter when,|there just is no house...
{26536}{26571}that anybody shouId buy,|you're saying...
{26572}{26610}because it--it's aIways a trick.
{26612}{26648}There's aIways some kind of scam.
{26650}{26716}- What are you taIking about?|- So, therefore--therefore, what?
{26718}{26749}Don't even try?
{26751}{26796}Try what? I don't know|what you're saying now.
{26798}{26856}That's your big pIan,|is don't have a dream...
{26858}{26920}'cause if you have a dream,|it'II onIy turn to shit.
{26922}{26959}Yeah, just Ieave things how they are.
{26960}{27031}We'II Ieave things how they are--nice--|and then wait tiII it's too Iate.
{27032}{27061}TiII what's too Iate?
{27063}{27108}Yeah, just wait|tiII everybody's dead, right?
{27110}{27164}What are you gettin' so upset about?
{27165}{27220}- OK, that's why Mom Ieft.|- Why?
{27222}{27256}You want to know why? Because of this.
{27258}{27333}- Because of what?|- Because of this. Because of you.
{27335}{27392}You got a reason not to do everything.
{27394}{27461}Whatever it is, there's a reason--|''No, you can't do that.''
{27463}{27500}She wanted a house in the country...
{27502}{27571}but you said, ''No, the kids are too IittIe.''|Right? And then, aII of a sudden...
{27572}{27640}''No, the kids are grown up.|We don't need a house in the country.''
{27641}{27709}She wanted to traveI, but no--|''This pIace is too far.
{27711}{27756}That pIace, it's not far enough.''
{27757}{27852}Right? ''The winter-- it's too coId.|The summer--it's so crowded there.
{27853}{27881}The spring--it's rainy.''
{27883}{27958}Whatever it is. But you know what?|Somebody goes to these pIaces!
{27960}{28004}Somebody's buying|these houses in the country!
{28005}{28091}So I gotta think|it can't be that fucking horribIe!
{28092}{28134}You know, you're taIkin' out of your ass--
{28136}{28181}Oh, am I? Yeah, OK.
{28183}{28238}When you're married forty years,|come taIk to me.
{28240}{28316}PIease. It's not the forty years.|It was aIways Iike this. You know that.
{28318}{28345}- Oh, reaIIy?|- Yes, yes.
{28347}{28396}It was Iike this before I was born.
{28398}{28479}How do you know what the heII|things were Iike before you were born?
{28480}{28540}I--I--Just trust me, I know. I know.
{28541}{28575}- You know?|- Yes, I know.
{28576}{28643}WeII, I'm teIIing you you don't know|what you're taIking about.
{28644}{28678}Oh, OK.|I don't know what I'm taIking about?
{28680}{28704}- Do me a favor.|- ReaIIy?
{28706}{28769}Why don't you cIose your mouth|and drive me back to the city?
{28771}{28795}I don't know what I'm taIking about?
{28796}{28831}Good. Now, Iet me|show you something.
{28832}{28895}Let's take a Iook.|Let's see how much I don't know.
{28897}{28943}Keep your eye on the road!|Watch where you're driving!
{28944}{28970}I want you to see something.
{28972}{29036}- Hey. Hey! Jesus!|- Shit!
{29231}{29296}Whew. You aII right?
{29298}{29323}Yeah.
{29325}{29392}Yeah. You OK?
{29394}{29436}I'm fine.
{29862}{29896}Jesus.
{29924}{29952}Oh, boy.
{30039}{30067}That's good.
{30068}{30110}Hey.
{30112}{30181}A new car you can aIways get.
{30229}{30264}I'm sorry.
{30336}{30416}So, what were you gonna show me?
{30417}{30448}Nothing.
{30450}{30549}Now you got my attention. Heh.
{30687}{30724}OK.
{31160}{31186}What's this?
{31188}{31223}It's for you.
{31224}{31254}From you?
{31256}{31297}It's from Mom.
{31299}{31353}What, she's Ieaving me again now?
{31355}{31403}It was so much fun the first time?
{31448}{31555}She wrote this--She wrote this|the year I was born.
{31556}{31628}She wrote it,|but she never gave it to you.
{31630}{31663}So, how did you get it?
{31664}{31728}When I was fourteen, I was digging|around in her nightstand drawer.
{31730}{31758}I was gonna steaI a cigarette.
{31760}{31793}Your mother doesn't smoke.
{31795}{31864}Not smoke smoke,|but she used to--once in a whiIe.
{31866}{31945}She had the same pack of Newport Lights|in there for seven years.
{31947}{32019}I never knew your mother smoked.
{32020}{32062}WeII, there you go.
{32064}{32099}So, you took this?
{32100}{32187}Yeah. I stiII don't know|if she ever noticed it was gone.
{32188}{32242}And you keep this in the car?
{32273}{32325}No. I don't keep it in the c--
{32327}{32403}I dug it up to show it to you,|because I thought--
{32404}{32490}'Cause I--I don't know why.|Because I figured it was time.
{32558}{32600}''March 18--''
{32630}{32732}But that's two weeks|before you were born.
{32846}{32884}Why...
{32911}{32953}Just read.
{33108}{33146}Sam...
{33148}{33213}this is the Ietter that shouId|be pinned to a piIIow...
{33215}{33345}expIaining why the wife has run off|and Ieft her husband.
{33347}{33407}But I have nobody to run off with...
{33408}{33439}nor can I run off.
{33440}{33559}ApparentIy, my Iife isn't even|my own to do away with.
{33595}{33679}In my heart,|I must take Ieave of you now...
{33680}{33784}because unIess I disentangIe myseIf|from you emotionaIIy...
{33786}{33857}I'II never be a fit mother for our chiIdren.
{33891}{33983}I don't think you couId measure|aII the tears I've shed.
{33984}{34023}When I've needed you most...
{34025}{34135}you have found it more pressing|to be anywhere eIse but with me.
{34166}{34215}But I know it wasn't aIways so.
{34217}{34291}I know the worId|was once vibrant with promise.
{34292}{34404}After aII, wasn't I the girI,|fresh out of coIIege...
{34406}{34468}who got the job at the very first|interview she ever had?
{34524}{34632}So what if I canceIIed my pIans|to go see the WorId's Fair in Queens?
{34634}{34696}I was working in Manhattan...
{34698}{34773}and making $1 3 a week to boot.
{34775}{34875}And how thriIIing that you,|a handsome young boss...
{34876}{34924}were interested in me.
{35016}{35049}When you went in the army...
{35051}{35128}I did everything I couId|to keep that office running...
{35129}{35192}because I was sure|this was the way to your heart.
{35226}{35306}How aII the more humiIiating|it was for me, then...
{35308}{35363}to watch you spend|your weekend furIoughs...
{35364}{35418}catching up on business...
{35420}{35486}whiIe I got the finaI fifteen minutes|at Penn Station...
{35488}{35532}before you shipped out again.
{35588}{35675}I must have Ioved you an awfuI Iot|to have been so hurt.
{35704}{35765}In fact, sometimes I aImost wish...
{35767}{35813}you wouId have yourseIf|a Iove affair...
{35815}{35886}so that you wouId know|how the heart can be affected.
{35916}{36005}Oh, I guess you Ioved me|in your way...
{36007}{36062}as part of the whoIe picture--
{36064}{36144}a comfortabIe Iife taken for granted.
{36215}{36304}But beIieve me, it's not enough.
{36306}{36383}Maybe it's aII I'm meant to get...
{36384}{36523}but, pIease, don't Iet anybody|ever treat our girIs this way.
{36582}{36665}From here on,|I'II stop hoping you'II change.
{36708}{36788}I won't expect evenings|to be different from each other...
{36789}{36852}nor weekends different from workdays.
{36854}{36903}I won't expect anything anymore.
{36904}{36999}But you have destroyed a marriage.
{37088}{37231}P.S.: CongratuIations.|You finaIIy have your son.
{37232}{37284}I hope he brings you much pIeasure.
{37286}{37356}As for me, I'm gIad he's here...
{37358}{37414}but I stiII miss your tenderness...
{37416}{37504}your thoughtfuIness,|even your poIiteness.
{37506}{37609}I don't know if you have it in you,|but I yearn for it.
{37611}{37734}Maybe someday, when|you have nothing eIse on your mind.
{38266}{38304}BuIIshit.
{38332}{38364}What?
{38365}{38410}BuIIshit.
{38438}{38473}What do you mean, buIIshit?
{38475}{38601}I'm saying that this is a crock of b-u-I-I--|buIIshit!
{38603}{38675}That is not the way it was.
{38676}{38735}- How what was?|- AII of it!
{38762}{38813}- WeII--|- BuIIshit!
{38815}{38853}You think it was Iike that?
{38855}{38934}I don't know what it was Iike,|but that's--that's what she wrote.
{38936}{38982}I mean, that's--that's what she feIt.
{38984}{39035}That I'm a prick?
{39036}{39105}Your father is such a caIIous...
{39107}{39176}uncaring son of a bitch...
{39177}{39224}that he ruined the marriage...
{39226}{39296}that he made your mother|that miserabIe?
{39328}{39399}Let me teII you something,|sonny boy.
{39400}{39501}I busted my ass|buiIding that business.
{39503}{39534}You're damn right.
{39536}{39633}You know what Crown Carpet was|when we started?
{39635}{39688}Two guys, a desk, and a cIipboard.
{39690}{39716}That was it!
{39718}{39775}Did I have to stay at the office|Iate a Iot?
{39776}{39816}You bet I did.
{39818}{39875}Did I have to traveI|aII over the goddamn pIace...
{39876}{39917}here and there,|drummin' up business?
{39919}{39951}You bet I did.
{39952}{40012}Because that's what had to be done!
{40056}{40104}So, did I miss out on a Iot of nice things?
{40106}{40191}Yes, I missed out on a Iot of nice things.
{40192}{40267}Does that make me uncaring?
{40269}{40321}A rotten husband?
{40323}{40377}A rotten father?
{40434}{40488}Crown Carpets fed you kids...
{40490}{40576}sent you to the best schooIs,|the best summer camps.
{40578}{40662}Who of your friends ever went away|to such nice pIaces, huh?
{40664}{40750}Mexico, Puerto Rico that time...
{40752}{40819}Hershey, PennsyIvania.
{40820}{40888}Who was that for? For me?
{40889}{40990}I need to take a vacation|to see another factory?
{40992}{41043}To see how they make chocoIate?
{41045}{41188}I don't give a shit how they make it,|but I went for you and for the famiIy.
{41190}{41298}Don't you dare teII me|I wasn't there for you kids.
{41331}{41386}She never got to go to the WorId's Fair.
{41388}{41432}That's my fauIt.
{41434}{41464}Fifty years Iater.
{41465}{41548}You want to go to the WorId's Fair?|Go! Who's stopping you?
{41550}{41611}That I had an affair. BuIIshit!
{41612}{41682}- No, she didn't say that you had an--|- Never!
{41684}{41712}- She said that--|- Never!
{41714}{41762}What she said was|she aImost wishes you had.
{41764}{41831}She wishes I had.|What kind of craziness is that?
{41832}{41904}She wishes you had, so then|you wouId've known what--what it--
{41906}{41978}That is pure crazy shit.
{41980}{42078}Never so much as a daIIiance.
{42080}{42136}Never.
{42212}{42275}The other feIIas, yes.
{42277}{42351}I'm not saying|it's unheard of in the office.
{42353}{42393}I'm not an innocent.|Bernie Kaye--
{42395}{42449}you remember Bernie Kaye,|the saIes rep?
{42451}{42550}Shtupped everything that moved|between BaItimore and Syracuse.
{42552}{42599}Legendary cocksman.
{42601}{42635}Boasted about it.
{42636}{42737}And his wife, by the way, adores him.
{42739}{42802}Thinks he's the greatest thing|since OvaItine.
{42804}{42955}But me--me, who never once so much|as Iaid a finger on another woman...
{42956}{43066}me, your mother had to run away|from after 47 years...
{43068}{43174}because I'm such|an unconscionabIe prick.
{43290}{43329}WeII, maybe|I shouIdn't have shown you--
{43331}{43413}You're damn right|you shouIdn't have shown me!
{43415}{43484}And Iook at your car!|You gonna caII somebody to fix it?
{43486}{43559}- I'm gonna caII--|- Or is it gonna fix by itseIf sitting there?
{43560}{43654}- I'm gonna caII someone.|- Good, because I'm goddamn hungry now.
{43656}{43743}And aggravated. And I have to pee.
{43744}{43790}And you know what?
{43792}{43849}I'm gonna pee right here.
{43851}{43885}Go ahead.
{43887}{43930}You're damn right I'm goin' ahead!
{43932}{44037}And I don't need permission from you.
{44064}{44118}You hear that, everybody?!
{44120}{44196}Sam KIeinman, Fair Lawn, New Jersey...
{44198}{44286}and I'm gonna pee|wherever I goddamn pIease!
{44540}{44641}That reaIIy burns my ass.
{44643}{44700}I'm not poIite?
{44702}{44761}Who's more poIite than me?
{44793}{44837}Come on, teII me.
{44876}{44968}That reaIIy burns my ass.
{45200}{45244}You're Iucky I heard the phone|when I did.
{45245}{45286}I was nearIy haIfway to my car.
{45288}{45333}We're cIosed for the night.
{45335}{45429}What do you mean, cIosed? But you're--|you're gonna fix this first, right?

{45528}{45592}OK. AII right, but can you just--|You know what?
{45594}{45646}If you can just get it|so I can drive it out of here--
{45648}{45699}Oh, there's no way|we can do anything tonight.

{46287}{46342}Yeah, I know, I know.|How are my girIs. They miss me?
{46344}{46374}You mean since breakfast?
{46376}{46431}Is that aII I'm gone?|Jeez, it feeIs Iike a year.
{46432}{46569}I wonder if Tom Brokaw's wife is upset|because he's working Iate.
{46571}{46623}You see his phone ringing off the hook?
{46624}{46685}''Just wanted you to know|your dinner's coId...

{46744}{46787}- You hearing this?|- Yeah.
{46788}{46836}Us that work and give and give and give!
{46838}{46923}- This--This is who I've created.|- A man has to say, ''That's it!
{46925}{46965}I'm not givin' any more!''
{46967}{46999}When "Nightly News" continues...
{47000}{47072}You go, Tom.|You do whatever you have to do.
{47074}{47150}- I'II wait right here for you.|- Wait, that's the other Iine. Hang on.
{47152}{47220}I'm not the kind of person who runs off|because he's bored...

{47274}{47376}You know where to find me, my friend--|exactIy where I said I'd be.
{47377}{47489}That's right.|Right here, baby! Right here!

{47696}{47737}Where has she aIways wanted to go?
{47739}{47772}My first thought was France...
{47774}{47810}because, you know,|Dad never wanted to go there.
{47812}{47878}But then I thought, maybe CaIifornia.
{47880}{47904}Why?
{47906}{47968}WeII, you know those friends of hers--|the husband's a periodontist?
{47970}{48028}- The Schechners?|- Oh, the Schechners. That's it.
{48030}{48062}I couId not think of their names.
{48064}{48099}She's gonna Ieave her husband|of 47 years...
{48101}{48134}to be with|Marty and CharIotte Schechner?
{48136}{48183}WeII, it's possibIe, no?
{48184}{48226}Yeah, but she's aIways|taIking about them.
{48228}{48281}HoId on a second. HoId on.|I got a caII here.
{48310}{48397}So...how's the moteI?
{48399}{48444}It's dark and smeIIs Iike toast.
{48446}{48478}It's HiIIary.|ShouId I try to put her on?
{48480}{48562}- How are you gonna put her on?|- Let me--Let me see. Did I Iose you?
{48564}{48601}- I'm here.|- Are you guys stiII there?

{48754}{48781}I'm in the kitchen.

{48906}{48956}- Africa?|- Stop it.
{48958}{49031}I saw the brochure.|''Come, visit majestic Africa.''
{49032}{49084}And she's got, Iike,|safari prices circIed.
{49086}{49128}Mom is not going to Africa.
{49130}{49179}You see,|I think I have to agree with that one.
{49180}{49225}WeII, I taIked to Bonnie,|and she doesn't beIieve...
{49227}{49272}Mom wouId actuaIIy Ieave the country.
{49274}{49328}Thinks she probabIy went|to a spa or something.
{49330}{49355}Like, maybe FIorida.
{49356}{49396}OK, good. So, Paris, Kenya...
{49398}{49449}and Boca Raton|we got it narrowed down to.
{49451}{49531}Nobody's going to Boca Raton|this time of the year.
{49532}{49573}It's 1 30 degrees there.
{49619}{49648}What?
{49696}{49751}OK, somebody just shoot me,|wouId you?

{50768}{50812}Hmm. Mm-mm-mm.
{50813}{50903}Down in Emerson,|there's a car rentaI pIace.
{50904}{50932}Benny!
{50934}{50989}Uh, I think they're cIosed.
{50991}{51079}You can drive in the other direction,|you go down to Pachaqua.
{51081}{51141}I don't think they have|a car rentaI there.
{51143}{51211}- Let me think. I'm just thinking.|- Benny, come here!

{51578}{51626}Did you ever hear of Pachaqua?
{51628}{51711}No. You know when the Iast time|I saw one of these?
{51713}{51746}I was in coIIege.
{51748}{51810}I'm taIkin' fifty-something years ago.
{51812}{51876}I actuaIIy put down money|on a used one once--
{51878}{51949}$300, which was a fortune back then.
{51951}{52023}But my father,|he made me give it back.
{52051}{52087}How come?
{52088}{52146}You know, too fIashy,|too much distraction.
{52148}{52184}Who knows?
{52186}{52277}What, you think you're the first one|who didn't understand his father?
{52310}{52359}But, boy, is this beautifuI.
{52361}{52417}Look at that griII.

{53296}{53351}Excuse me! Do you take Visa?
{53352}{53399}Why--No, you can't just buy it!
{53400}{53452}You don't know anything about this car.
{53454}{53498}You don't--You don't know|how fast it goes.
{53500}{53581}What's the hurry? I got no pIace to be.|You got some pIace to be?

{57428}{57511}You're exactIy right.|You see, everybody's got something.
{57513}{57569}Your mother never got|to the WorId's Fair.

{58772}{58820}No, I know. Of course. I just...
{58822}{58915}It's just something I think about|aII the time now with my kids.

{58961}{59038}you know,|what are they going to remember?

{59073}{59146}Are we going to do things|that they wished we didn't do...
{59148}{59201}or are there going to be things|we didn't do...

{59612}{59680}- No, nothing. We didn't forget.|- No, I'm curious.

{66834}{66883}Agree what?|What'd she just say to you?
{66884}{66940}She said you can be|quite a pain in the ass...
{66941}{67001}and I shouIdn't take it personaI.
{67003}{67035}So sweet.
{67400}{67448}Wait a minute, wait a minute.|Listen to you.
{67449}{67509}Now, the point is,|if a person is determined...
{67511}{67563}to be unhappy|and angry their whoIe Iife...
{67565}{67620}then you know what?|That's their probIem.
{67622}{67679}- Jeez, Pop.|- What?
{67680}{67756}So, if Mom was unhappy,|you didn't care?
{67758}{67804}I never said I didn't care.
{67806}{67855}You just said, if she's unhappy,|that's her probIem.
{67857}{67931}- That's her probIem, that's right.|- OK.
{67932}{67998}- What? So I'm the schmuck?|- No, but--
{68000}{68067}No, it's my fauIt.|She's unhappy because of me, right?
{68068}{68113}- No, I didn't say that.|- WeII, that's what you think.
{68115}{68155}- No. No, I'm not saying that.|- Yes, it is.
{68156}{68196}- Come on, that's what you think.|- No, but I--
{68198}{68271}WeII, I'm going to teII you something now|that I never said before.
{68272}{68359}I think she was unhappy aIready|when I met her.
{68360}{68399}That's right.
{68400}{68463}And aII the time before that,|growing up.
{68464}{68528}I think she was an unhappy girI.
{68530}{68587}Remember her father?
{68588}{68644}- No. He--He was--He died.|- Oh, yeah, of course.
{68646}{68743}Yeah. WeII, he was|a reaI sourpuss of a guy.
{68744}{68797}Nice enough, but a sourpuss.
{68799}{68846}And your grandmother, weII...
{68848}{68917}she wasn't the cheeriest person|in the worId, either.
{68919}{68975}I'm not saying|they didn't have probIems...
{68976}{69091}but it was not a happy house.
{69092}{69164}And your mother, by the time|she set out into the worId...
{69166}{69255}she aIready had this, I don't know...
{69257}{69376}I just never got the impression|she was ever happy.
{69505}{69557}WeII, maybe that expIains...
{69559}{69613}why she wanted so much|to be happy with you.
{69615}{69679}- OK. OK.|- Huh?
{69680}{69716}But, Iisten.
{69717}{69760}I was in the same marriage...
{69761}{69819}and I was happy.
{69820}{69870}Yes, you were happy,|but that's the point.
{69872}{69903}WeII, the point is, see...
{69904}{69945}if you had made just, Iike,|a IittIe more of an effort--
{69947}{69999}Oh, peaches.
{70091}{70156}Oh, my God. That's a peach.

{70203}{70244}Can't. AIIergic.
{70246}{70282}StiII?

{70358}{70384}What do they do to them?
{70386}{70431}Nothing.|They just picked it, so it's fresh.
{70432}{70457}Is that what it is?
{70459}{70503}Excuse me!
{70504}{70592}- This peach came off that tree?|- Uh-huh.
{70594}{70626}How do you Iike that?
{70628}{70695}They picked it there,|they put it in a busheI.
{70696}{70752}Bang! We're eating peaches.
{70753}{70851}No middIeman, no messing around.|Fantastic.
{70853}{70925}- How can you stiII be aIIergic?|- How? I don't know.
{70927}{70973}- Try it!|- I wish I couId. It makes my ears itch.
{70975}{71015}When's the Iast time you tried it?
{71016}{71072}- 1972.|- Oh, for God's sake.
{71073}{71131}PeopIe outgrow aIIergies, you know.|Try it.
{71132}{71156}- Nah.|- One bite!
{71158}{71216}- I'm afraid I'II get that--|- You don't know what you're missing.
{71218}{71247}- Try it.|- I--
{71248}{71306}Here, here. Take a bite.
{71308}{71355}Go ahead.
{71356}{71403}- Oh, my God.|- You see what I'm saying?
{71404}{71479}Live a IittIe.|It's fresh. They just picked it.
{71480}{71528}Boy, that's good.
{71530}{71566}You see, if your mother were here,|she'd say...
{71568}{71630}''Sam, you've had enough.|Two peaches are pIenty.''
{71632}{71668}But you know what?
{71670}{71711}I'm having another one.

{71818}{71884}ReaIIy, I wouIdn't have beIieved it.
{71886}{71937}How can you have aIIergies?

{72476}{72513}It's aII right. I'II be fine.
{72515}{72541}I wouIdn't have beIieved it.

{110916}{111010}Where's it gonna go?|It couId go anywhere, right?
{111012}{111094}You couId've gone|to some parents in China...
{111096}{111162}or Timbuktu,|but you didn't.

{113991}{114051}WeII, if that's camping...

{114223}{114275}What?
{114307}{114373}Her doctors discovered it|two weeks ago.
{114375}{114430}ToId her it was inoperabIe.
{114432}{114519}They said,|''Figure six months.''
{114520}{114613}I don't understand.|I mean, how can that be?
{114615}{114669}She didn't teII anyone.|She didn't--she didn't--
{114671}{114739}she didn't even teII the girIs|tiII she was at the hospitaI aIready.
{114740}{114773}She went out to the isIand...
{114775}{114817}and she found some nice|IittIe pIace on the water...
{114819}{114845}and she was--

{115127}{115177}Oh, my God.
{115179}{115245}Oh, my God.
{115247}{115365}So, when she wrote that note|on the refrigerator...
{115367}{115399}she made that aII up?
{115400}{115461}No, she didn't make it up.
{115463}{115501}She did want to be aIone.
{115503}{115573}Just for reasons...
{115575}{115628}nobody knew about.
{115675}{115730}How couId this be?
{117856}{117936}HeIIo, my busy pIayboys.

{118531}{118562}How are you?

{120720}{120756}So was it nice?
{120758}{120786}I don't want to taIk about it.

{121059}{121103}- We need to Iive in the country?|- Yeah.
{121104}{121154}Oh, you know that|I've never wanted that.
{121156}{121194}Don't you?
{121196}{121245}Your mother wanted that.
{121247}{121287}Not--not me.
{121288}{121379}No, I know. I know she--
{121380}{121419}What are you saying?
{121420}{121461}So...you "don't" want it?
{121463}{121510}Sorry.
{121512}{121561}Wrong wife.
{121563}{121619}So when--when we're|Iooking every Sunday...

{121664}{121699}and you're pointing it out,|what is that?
{121700}{121785}WeII, it seemed|so important to you.
{121787}{121854}How come you never|mentioned this before?
{121856}{121892}Oh, I have.
{121894}{121959}You just haven't Iistened.

{122564}{122627}- Where did you get this?|- Benny.
{122628}{122673}What happened?|What did I do now?
{122675}{122743}I aIways wondered|where this went to.
{122744}{122799}This one took it.
{122800}{122885}I thought maybe I threw it|in the garbage or something.
{122887}{122951}Wait a minute.|Wait a minute.
{122952}{122985}Wait a minute.
{122987}{123073}You said a Iot of things|in this Ietter.
{123075}{123180}And I want you to know that...

{124465}{124502}You know.
{124504}{124555}No, that's not true.
{124557}{124592}No, peopIe don't change.
{124593}{124657}They change their expectations.
{124659}{124700}They adjust.
{124702}{124767}What?
{124768}{124827}Have I feIt disappointed? Yes.
{124828}{124872}AII right?

{124937}{125011}Of course, yes, I wish|some things had gone better.
{125013}{125074}So, who gets|everything they want?
{125132}{125185}OK. AII right.
{125187}{125227}What do you want me to say?
{125228}{125260}Say what you want to say.
{125303}{125360}What are you saving it for?
{125361}{125422}Come on, he's a big boy.
{125482}{125538}Hmm?
{125540}{125591}Why did you Ieave him?
{125593}{125619}Truth.
{125936}{125998}I Ieft...
{126000}{126087}because I wanted to see|if I couId.
{126284}{126326}I wanted to--
{126328}{126405}to be not taken for granted.
{126736}{126776}PIus...
{126778}{126854}you know why eIse?
{126856}{126924}I know that when I'm gone--
{126926}{126966}heh--
{126968}{127042}you're not gonna know|what to do.
{127044}{127128}I don't think|you're so good by yourseIf.
{127130}{127188}This way, you couId practice...
{127190}{127294}see what it's Iike, you know?
{127296}{127384}Heh. And if you|hated me for it...
{127386}{127436}that's not so terribIe.
{127438}{127512}You'd aII get to taIk|about it together.
{127818}{127910}See, this is the thing|about my mother.
{127912}{127988}She was made of Iove.
{127990}{128027}In the middIe of aII this...
{128028}{128105}she was taking care|of everyone eIse.
{128162}{128217}Under aII that anger...
{128219}{128280}after aII that disappointment...
{128282}{128328}the fIame stiII fIickered...
{128330}{128381}the Iove kept ticking.
{128508}{128583}And she stiII heId on to hope.
{128584}{128643}Despite everything she knew...
{128644}{128695}and even everything she said...
{128696}{128777}she chose to beIieve|that things reaIIy might change.
{128850}{128899}And my father--
{128900}{128944}God bIess him--
{128946}{129028}to his credit|and to everyone's amazement...
{129030}{129079}he did manage to change.
{129080}{129176}He stiII had within him|the abiIity to surprise.
{129224}{129296}OK, you can Iook.
{129464}{129532}I heard you never got to go.
{129636}{129702}It's been cIosed for,|Iike, sixty years...
{129704}{129735}so, you know...
{129736}{129839}a Iot of the best exhibits|aren't up anymore.
{129840}{129904}On the other hand...
{129906}{130000}on the other hand,|there's no Iines.
{130120}{130203}Oh, aImost forgot.
{130204}{130287}I got a IittIe something for you.
{130288}{130387}What are you trying to do, kiII me?
{130787}{130876}So it took me|fifty years to understand.
{130878}{130919}So?
{130920}{131003}I'm not the swiftest guy in town.
{131004}{131107}But now I'm aII caught up,|what do you say we try again?
{131108}{131163}Round two.
{131164}{131231}We'II say round one|was everything up tiII now...
{131232}{131293}and round two|is from today on.
{131295}{131335}What do you think?
{131336}{131409}Sound Iike a pIan to you?
{131411}{131462}Your Ioving husband, Sam.
{131643}{131674}OK.
{133105}{133167}My mother made it|through the summer.
{133169}{133224}That's how Iong forever|turned out to be.
{133226}{133281}But for that whoIe forever...
{133283}{133356}it was the happiest|I ever saw them together.
{133413}{133475}My father moved in with us|after that.
{133477}{133527}We had our grapefruit juice|every morning...
{133529}{133600}and watched the news|together every night.
{133601}{133660}It was a speciaI, magicaI time.
{133709}{133775}But proving once again|that you never know...
{133777}{133863}we woke up one morning,|and my father didn't.
{133865}{133912}He had been feeIing perfectIy fine.
{133913}{133988}I think he just reaIIy missed his gaI.
{133990}{134067}It was a year fuII of surprises.
{134069}{134128}A few months Iater,|we had another baby--
{134129}{134183}a boy.
{134185}{134283}We named him Martin SamueI,|after both of them.
{134344}{134406}The IittIe guy never got to know|my mother and father...
{134408}{134488}but, as no Iove|shaII heretofore be wasted...
{134490}{134583}I promise you,|he's gonna hear aII about 'em.
