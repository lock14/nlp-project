00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,654
Benden daha az tecrübeli olanlar..

3
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,718
...Size kýzlar hakkýnda söyleyeceklerim var.

4
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:57,193
Temel olarak, çok iðrençlerdir.

5
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,818
Anlýyorsunuz ya, bu taraftan her þey oldukça siyah beyaz kadar farklý görünüyor.

6
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:05,194
Eskiden, 1 ilkokul 1 yada 2 sýnýftayken..

7
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,834
.. erkekler arasýndaki en yaygýn düþünce, baþkalarýna bit bulaþtýrdýklarýydý.

8
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,493
Biiit!! Bana dokundu!!

9
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:12,935
- Bitler!!!
- Dokunma bana!!

10
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:16,008
Bitli! O artýk bitlendi!!

11
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,671
Aslýnda, bit ne demek, bilmiyorduk bile!

12
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,973
...but the general feeling was,
if a girl touched you...

13
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,741
...some very, very bad things
were gonna happen.

14
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:37,392
How right we were.

15
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,617
This is me now.

16
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:41,922
I've been in love
for two and a half weeks...

17
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:45,497
...and it's a pain I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemies.

18
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:48,468
I'm not gonna dress this up pretty.

19
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:51,695
Just about everything I know
about women, love...

20
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,840
...and the birds and the freaking bees...

21
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,566
...I've learned in the past
two and half weeks.

22
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,209
But when you're 10 years old...

23
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,105
Rosemary!

24
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:03,839
...two and a half weeks
can be a lifetime.

25
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,666
Okay, here's the deal:

26
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,643
If you came to hear some
great New York love story...

27
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,042
...keep walking.

28
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,979
You want a real love story?
I'll tell you a real one.

29
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:35,554
My parents, Camp Anawana,
Catskill Mountains, 1984.

30
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:38,849
My father was 19
and the star sports counselor.

31
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,855
- Shoot it.
- My mom was a C.I.T.

32
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:43,317
People say she reminded them
of Sissy Spacek.

33
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:51,358
What happened under that harvest moon
that summer, that's the stuff of legend.

34
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,298
In my family,
it's what we like to refer to as...

35
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,006
...ancient history.

36
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,406
These days,
my dad's sleeping on the couch.

37
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,476
Due to this unusual quirk
in the New York state divorce code...

38
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,641
...neither one of my parents
can move out of our apartment...

39
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:11,272
...until their settlement is signed,
sealed and delivered.

40
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,583
Needless to say, it doesn't make
for the greatest living environment.

41
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,382
- Did you drink my Pepsi?
- It was my Pepsi.

42
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,785
It had my name on it.

43
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,325
Especially since my mom's
recently decided to start dating again.

44
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,987
- Hello.
- Leslie?

45
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,927
Is there anything worse
than being mistaken for your mother?

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,534
- No, this is Gabe.
- Hey, sorry, big guy.

47
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:37,398
You two sound so much alike.
Is your mom around? This is Ronny.

48
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:40,335
I got it, honey. You can hang up.

49
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:44,838
Now, that's a real love story.

50
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,243
This much I know firsthand:
Love ends.

51
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,077
You want proof?
Check out my parents' refrigerator.

52
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:59,415
Why did I ever have to discover
this ridiculous pain inside of me?

53
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:04,449
Because two and a half weeks ago,
before all this love nonsense...

54
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,821
And I'm not just saying this either.

55
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:09,156
No, before all this, I was happy.

56
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,662
No!

57
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,162
Truly happy.

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,462
I'm serious. My life was filled with song.

59
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:19,264
And sport.

60
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,197
And constant adventure.

61
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,534
Oh, Rosemary.

62
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,578
Rosemary, Rosemary, Rosemary.

63
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,839
Why did you ever
have to come into my life?

64
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,782
Who am I kidding?

65
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:38,182
She's been in my life
for as long as I can remember.

66
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:42,056
For one little stretch there
during kindergarten...

67
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,248
...you might even say we were friends.

68
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,690
What are you kids doing under there?

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,263
That was before first grade,
when the iron curtain came down.

70
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,025
Girls on one side...

71
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,896
...boys on the other.

72
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,839
Oh, she was still there, of course.

73
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,201
I have the class pictures to prove it.

74
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,003
I just didn't see her.

75
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,976
I lived in a world of men.

76
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,137
So who wants to go to Duane Reade?

77
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,874
Man, I am not helping you
steal Kit Kats again, Max.

78
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,278
Watch it!

79
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:19,545
But you got no trouble eating the candy
I provide for you, do you?

80
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,519
I'm not doing lookout. I'm sorry, guys.

81
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,056
- Hey, guys, it's 5:00. I gotta roll.
- I thought we were gonna shoot some 21.

82
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:28,217
No, I'm meeting my dad
for football practice.

83
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,191
See you guys later.

84
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:32,763
The two of you are so nuts, man.

85
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:35,263
See, my father and I
have this sort of plan.

86
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,266
I'm gonna be the Tiger Woods
of the place-kicking world.

87
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:40,403
- Yeah!
- And he's gonna be my Earl.

88
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,802
See? If you dedicate yourself
to one goal and one goal only...

89
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,600
...at a ridiculously young age...

90
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,471
...history has taught us
we can achieve anything. Get back.

91
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,168
- One, two, three...
- You see? Before Rosemary Telesco...

92
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:52,779
...I had a very fulfilling life.

93
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:53,937
Nice.

94
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,949
How did it get so late?

95
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:58,517
Your mother's gonna have
dinner waiting for you.

96
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:01,483
What do you say we stop by Patsy's
and get a couple of slices?

97
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,179
- Can I take karate?
- Karate?

98
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,755
It's a martial art.

99
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:08,688
- What's karate have to do with place-kicking?
- It can't hurt.

100
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,488
- Well, how much is it?
- I can?

101
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:15,495
If it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg.
It might help your flexibility. Sure.

102
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,657
Mistake number one
was ever taking that godforsaken class.

103
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,826
Karate is not about strength.

104
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:30,104
It's about skill. It's about focus.

105
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,211
It's an art of determination.

106
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,474
- When she showed up that first day...
- Sorry, my tap class ran late.

107
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,847
...I was actually kind of glad, you know.
A familiar face and all that.

108
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,289
I didn't know anybody else in the class.

109
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,595
If you can master the art of karate,
you can master anything.

110
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,831
Come on!

111
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,969
About face.

112
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,801
Middle punch, kiai.

113
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:09,739
You're each gonna progress
through this course at your own pace.

114
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,039
Those of you who pass the test
to get your yellow belt will be given yellow.

115
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:18,580
Those who pass red, red.

116
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,880
It's about finding your personal best.

117
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,218
Come on.

118
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,383
Now, I want you to pair up.
Everyone gets a sparring partner.

119
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:36,360
Oh, the painful dance of pairing up.

120
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,027
Twenty seconds of pure torture.

121
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:48,168
Now, I didn't want a girl for
a sparring partner. Would you?

122
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,501
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:57,313
Okay, let me tell you something
about Rosemary Telesco.

124
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:01,041
Rosemary wasn't the prettiest girl
in our class. That was Madison Shaw.

125
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:04,311
And she wasn't the second prettiest either.
That was Vanessa Muir.

126
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:09,015
No, Rosemary was third.
But, boy, could that girl do karate.

127
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,292
Keep it tight.

128
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,766
Don't get the wrong idea.
We weren't really friends.

129
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:28,133
We were just karate friends.

130
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,466
Back at school,
nothing changed, of course.

131
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:34,811
As far as the rest of the world
was concerned, the real world...

132
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,741
...that iron curtain was still solid.

133
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,581
But when we put on those white robes...

134
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,413
...we could see past our many differences
and fight like equals.

135
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:50,081
There was just one tiny problem.

136
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,885
I pretty much sucked at karate.

137
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,060
We all congratulate Rosemary Telesco...

138
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,394
...on being the first in the class
to earn her yellow belt.

139
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,002
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,201
Talk about an assault
to everything I knew about the world.

141
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:13,073
Girls mature faster than boys.

142
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:15,642
That's completely made up.
Boys are much more mature.

143
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,506
This isn't a matter of opinion, Gabe.
There were studies.

144
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,581
Girls speak first, they walk first.
I see it in my little sister's class.

145
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,342
The boys her age all seem retarded.

146
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:28,146
There's absolutely no reason I shouldn't
be able to get my yellow belt in a week.

147
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,755
- You don't take it seriously.
- I take it seriously.

148
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:34,086
You're not focused.
You think you're this natural.

149
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,193
- You don't practice.
- I practice.

150
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,827
- When?
- All the time.

151
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:40,657
You should practice with me.
You'd get better.

152
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,661
- Fine, let's practice.
- Name the time.

153
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,697
- I don't care. This afternoon.
- Fine.

154
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,096
Great.

155
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,499
Oh, I forgot. I have this one errand.

156
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:53,334
I'm supposed to be this flower girl
in a couple of weeks, and I have this fitting.

157
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:56,841
But it's gonna be, like, five minutes.
I promise.

158
00:10:57,245 --> 00:11:00,338
Classic female move.
The bait and switch.

159
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:04,142
My mother's tricked me
into many a shoe store with that one.

160
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,350
Is there anything worse
than dress shopping?

161
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,748
I'm serious.

162
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:12,856
I'd rather have my toenails peeled off
one by one with pliers...

163
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,856
...than spend five minutes
in a dress store.

164
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:38,369
Okay, what's going on here?
What the heck is this?

165
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:43,243
My God, what's this feeling
in the pit of my stomach?

166
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:45,348
Who is this..?

167
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:49,918
This amazing creature before me?

168
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,284
What do you think?

169
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:56,849
You are going to be
the prettiest flower girl there.

170
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,888
I'm definitely gonna be the oldest one.

171
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,431
Who..?

172
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,292
- Who's getting married?
- My mom's sister.

173
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,161
Oh. Cool.

174
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:15,869
It's kind of weird because she's,
like, seven months pregnant.

175
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:20,205
In that one moment, Rosemary Telesco
leaped past Vanessa Muir...

176
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,073
...past Madison Shaw.

177
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:26,181
I looked at Rosemary
and just felt so...

178
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,083
...confused.

179
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,582
She's a girl.

180
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:33,188
I'm supposed to despise girls,
not feel nervous talking to one.

181
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,583
Not be all tongue-tied.

182
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:39,455
I mean, this was Rosemary Telesco.
I knew her since kindergarten.

183
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,392
Just a little rock.
I mean, it's... It'll be fine.

184
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,589
Just gonna grab my scooter.
I'm really cool, honestly.

185
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,770
As she took me to practice karate
at her place, one thing became clear.

186
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:02,270
Rosemary went to P.S. 87 because
her parents believed in public education.

187
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,709
See, believing in public education...

188
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:08,077
...wasn't really a luxury
my family could afford.

189
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,212
Don't go to Taos. Not without me.

190
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:13,751
Mr. And Mrs. Telesco, her parents...

191
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,323
...they, like, started this soap opera,
Santa Fe, that's on, like, every day...

192
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,083
...so you know they had a few bucks.

193
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,387
Oh, look at that. You see that?

194
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:26,190
I knew your folks were gonna
keep them together. Didn't I say it?

195
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,491
- Let's go practice in my bedroom.
- Okay.

196
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,134
- Will you have me, Kate?
- What do you think I'll say?

197
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,759
Come on. He is no good for you.
Get back in the truck.

198
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,433
If karate is all about focus...

199
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:42,173
- Good one.
...my focus was all over that pink room.

200
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:47,941
I mean, there I was,
in the inner sanctum, alone with her.

201
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:50,777
Smelling her smell.

202
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:53,681
What is that? Strawberry?

203
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:58,112
- So, what made you take karate?
- Made me?

204
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,882
Daryl Kitzens.

205
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,221
- Daryl Kitzens made you take karate?
- Yeah, have you seen the guy?

206
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,622
He's insane.

207
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,159
Daryl Kitzens is without a doubt
the scariest kid in the Upper West Side.

208
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,596
He's a fifth grader
but he's supposed to be in seventh.

209
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,593
He is a giant.

210
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,204
Held back two grades
out of his first five.

211
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:20,466
At the rate he's going,
he'll graduate from high school at age 27...

212
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:24,133
...and will have terrorized
an entire generation of Upper West Siders.

213
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,543
Are you afraid he's gonna beat you up?

214
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,677
No. No, no. Of course not.

215
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,150
I just, you know, wanna be ready
when that day comes, you know.

216
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,447
Who was I kidding? I was petrified.

217
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,417
Kitzens hangs out a lot...

218
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:43,151
...in front of the subway station
on 72nd and Broadway.

219
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:47,160
I haven't walked past that corner
since October.

220
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,527
- Well, we should practice more.
- Yeah, sure, let's go.

221
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,634
We need to start working
on those maneuvers he taught us.

222
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,498
Well, I kind of meant some other time.
It's getting kind of late.

223
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:01,970
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
It's getting kind of late anyway, so...

224
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,473
Yeah.

225
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,901
How could I have said that?

226
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,343
Okay, just shake it off. Keep it together.

227
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,877
- Are you okay?
- That's the... The door.

228
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:21,690
Look at her, living this perfect life up here,
with a view of the park and everything.

229
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,688
Yet she's so humble.

230
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,154
Suddenly, Rosemary's whole world
seemed very attractive to me.

231
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,263
Her parents, with all their success...

232
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,865
...the nanny who's been with her
since she was born...

233
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,662
...and the adopted 3-year-old sister
rescued from an orphanage in Beijing.

234
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:41,102
And me, my family's on a one-way ticket
to The Jerry Springer Show.

235
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,869
- Hi.
- Hey.

236
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,567
- Is Leslie around?
- Yeah.

237
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,945
Les, your date's here.

238
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,875
She's coming. I'm her...

239
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:55,912
...husband.

240
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:01,717
Only 20 more minutes of video,
okay, hon? Bedtime soon.

241
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,084
- All right.
- Good night.

242
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,955
- Adam, Ronny. Ronny, Adam.
- Yeah, yeah.

243
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,926
- You guys met? Okay, good.
- Yeah, we met.

244
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:12,689
Shall we?

245
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,594
See, this divorce thing...

246
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,234
- You guys have fun.
- Thank you.

247
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,563
...it's a very difficult situation
for everyone.

248
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,397
This isn't anybody's fault, you know.

249
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,199
It's not anybody's fault.

250
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:27,776
It's just that your father and I
are a lot more different than we thought.

251
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,344
They're just very different people.

252
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:35,415
Even though I was just 9 and a half,
I totally took it like a man.

253
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,253
Now, I'm not saying
I'm some latchkey kid.

254
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,356
I mean, I don't wanna make it seem like
my parents are irresponsible either.

255
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,424
But for a year now,
I've been able to roam the city.

256
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:53,196
Well, okay, not really the city.
Nine square blocks.

257
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:58,526
The planetarium to the north,
Riverside Park to the west...

258
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:03,071
...Central Park to the east.
And 72nd street to the south.

259
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,343
In those blocks, I own this town.

260
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,253
Rosemary lived on 81st Street,
near the park.

261
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:26,652
A few yards north
of my territory.

262
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:30,994
When I started, you know,
casually riding past her building...

263
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,356
...I was heading into
some uncharted waters.

264
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:42,432
It was summer break.
Our next karate class wasn't for three days.

265
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:46,265
Do you know how many Telescos there are
in the Manhattan phone book?

266
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,964
Two.

267
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,469
- Telescos'.
- One's a butcher shop down in the Village.

268
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:56,844
Rosemary? No, there's no Rosemary here.

269
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:59,982
- And trust me...
- This is Frank.

270
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,120
...the other was not her either.

271
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:05,450
Hi, is Rosemary there?

272
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,147
You the kid that called
a half an hour ago?

273
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:14,428
What was I to do?
Except loiter and hope?

274
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,702
Her doorman's looking at me.

275
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,204
Oh, my God, there she is.

276
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:32,773
I didn't have a contingency plan
for if I actually saw her.

277
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,942
Just go up to her. Go, go.
Say hi to her.

278
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,547
She looked so busy.
I'll talk to her another day.

279
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,017
Coward. You fool.
How could you be so weak?

280
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,557
I'm not weak. I'm only human.

281
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:50,692
What was I gonna say? "I was
in the neighborhood"? That's pathetic.

282
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,520
No, you're weak and you're pathetic.

283
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,719
And you're gonna be alone
your entire life.

284
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:58,332
Who cares? I'd rather be alone
than endure this misery and torment.

285
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,701
- Watch it, child.
- Gabe?

286
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,899
Oh, hi. How's it going?

287
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,872
I'm just, you know,
in the neighborhood.

288
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:17,105
- Don't you live in the neighborhood?
- Well, 73rd and West End.

289
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,182
I guess it sort of depends on
how the neighborhood is defined.

290
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:25,344
Could I sound like any more of a loser?

291
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:27,681
So, what are you guys up to?

292
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,381
Well, my sister's got a birthday party
in the park.

293
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,753
I'm just bringing my book.

294
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:36,021
- Wanna come?
- Come?

295
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:39,926
Sure.

296
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,301
Stop it.

297
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:50,930
- Sorry you came?
- Not yet.

298
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,966
- Bubble.
- Bubbles, yeah.

299
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:58,170
Look. Look, there's my point.
Those two kids are the same age.

300
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,510
She's, like, talking,
using her hands, telling stories...

301
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,651
...and he's drooling over a cupcake.

302
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,913
- They're not the same age.
- How much you wanna bet?

303
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,146
A buck says
he's six months younger than her.

304
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,553
- Buy me an ice cream?
- No, you're buying me one.

305
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,792
Excuse me.

306
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:17,259
- Is that your son?
- Yeah.

307
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,297
- How old is he?
- He's two and a half.

308
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,956
And that little girl,
do you know how old she is?

309
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:25,767
She's three months younger.

310
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,934
That proves nothing.

311
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:32,672
Man, look at her.

312
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:35,833
Have you ever seen anyone
more beautiful?

313
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,537
So smart too. She's just my type.

314
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:43,281
Wow, I didn't even know I had a type.

315
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,512
Now, if I could only shake the nanny,
we'd be in business.

316
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:52,090
- So should we get that ice cream now?
- Now?

317
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:54,851
Well, I mean, sure, if you want one.

318
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:58,587
- Birdie, could we go get an ice cream?
- Yeah, hurry back, now.

319
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:03,529
Oh, no, thanks.
Unfortunately, this one's on me.

320
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,031
My first date. The big spender.
Haagen-Dazs all the way, baby.

321
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:16,610
So how come I have
nothing to say to her?

322
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,609
And why isn't she looking at me?

323
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,078
Am I that hideous? Do I smell?

324
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,685
- You come here often?
- Central Park?

325
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,854
- Yeah.
- What kind of question is that?

326
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,546
I hate myself.

327
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,821
I live across the street, you know. You?

328
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,290
- Me?
- Are you more Riverside?

329
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,486
Yeah, I'm more of a Riverside guy.

330
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,530
That's really the park.
But Central Park's pretty cool.

331
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,291
I've done my time here.

332
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,958
Hey, Strawberry Fields.
You know what it's named for?

333
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,502
- Some Beatles song, right?
- Close.

334
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:53,105
It's actually the name
of the orphanage in Liverpool...

335
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,434
...where John Lennon
used to play with his friends.

336
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,836
- Really?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,374
I didn't know that. Neat.

338
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:02,343
I took Rosemary on a tour of the park
that would make your head spin.

339
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,982
This was my Central Park, my New York.

340
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,643
Yeah, they used to have herds and hundreds
and hundreds of sheep grazing these fields.

341
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,448
And then they gave the sheepherder
a job on the zoo at the lion house.

342
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,490
Oh, yeah, didn't the sheepherder
live up in Tavern on the Green?

343
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,628
It was a sheepfold back then,
but yeah.

344
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:34,069
See those buildings up there?

345
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,706
When I was younger, I'd pretend
they were pirate ships, and I'd fight them.

346
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:42,972
- I never took you for a pirate guy.
- Well, I outgrew that eventually.

347
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,468
That's where my aunt's
getting married next week.

348
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:23,375
Oh, the Boathouse. Of course.

349
00:23:23,713 --> 00:23:28,149
- Flower girl.
- Oh, I'm so looking forward to that.

350
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:31,552
My aunt asked me to be her flower girl
when I was 4.

351
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,277
But little did any of us know...

352
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,581
...it would take seven years
for her boyfriend to pop the question.

353
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:38,524
That's hilarious.

354
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:40,249
I was charming and suave.

355
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:42,894
Everything you could hope to be
on your first real date.

356
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:45,791
- Maybe we should practice more karate.
- You need it.

357
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:49,422
- I am this close to becoming a yellow belt.
- Try this close.

358
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:52,831
- What's tomorrow like for you?
- Saturday...

359
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,161
I've got cello in the morning.

360
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,306
And then the afternoon, I've got tap.

361
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:59,634
Tap? What time does tap end?

362
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,835
I'm sorry, after tap I've got this
Indian princess thing I do with my father.

363
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:06,741
Jeez, it was easier scheduling
Arab-Israeli peace talks...

364
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,575
...than making a date with this girl.

365
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,683
- What's Indian princess?
- It's this Daddy-and-me thing.

366
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,080
Don't ask.

367
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:16,483
I just do it so he won't feel guilty
working late all week.

368
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,555
- How about Sunday?
- Sunday's good.

369
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,157
- Morning?
- In the morning I have a tutor.

370
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,850
But how about the afternoon?

371
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:27,963
- Tutor? What kind of tutor?
- It's for the ERBs.

372
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,658
My parents want me to go
to Ethical Culture next year, or Trinity.

373
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,963
Private school? Really?

374
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:39,340
I probably won't get in anywhere.

375
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,200
Maybe I'll throw the test.

376
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,576
What exactly did that mean?
Was that some kind of sign?

377
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:49,806
She'd throw her test for me?
Does she "like" like me?

378
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:52,678
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Where were you, girl?

379
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,513
- I'm sorry. We were...
- "Sorry" ain't good enough.

380
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:57,677
You're 11 years old.
This is New York City.

381
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:00,346
You can't go off running
by yourself like that.

382
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,718
You want Birdie
telling your parents on you, huh?

383
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,891
Now, you two say your goodbyes now.

384
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:08,128
- Sunday afternoon?
- Sounds good.

385
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:11,789
- Maybe I should come to your place?
- My place?

386
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,696
See, ever since
my dad moved onto the couch...

387
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:17,133
...I've been uninterested
in having friends over.

388
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:19,803
- Perfect.
- See you then.

389
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:22,373
Come on, let's go. Here.

390
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:24,735
Running off like that.
You know better than that.

391
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:30,072
Never had I felt so alive.

392
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:33,547
I had a date with Rosemary.

393
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:48,457
Was there any better age to be
in any better city in the world?

394
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,931
Sunday couldn't come fast enough.

395
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:53,123
What was today?

396
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,030
Only Friday? Oh, the eternity.

397
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:57,829
Hey, watch where you're going!

398
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,995
- Get off the sidewalk, you maniac.
- Sorry!

399
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:08,008
- Hey, how goes it, Mr. Gabe?
- Pretty fine, Ralph.

400
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,305
How's it coming along
with that place-kicking?

401
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,744
Place-kicking?
I'm more into karate these days.

402
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,144
- Karate?
- Yeah.

403
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:16,444
You gotta watch the show
Xtreme Martial Arts...

404
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:18,712
...with this guy Mike Chaturantabut.

405
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:20,116
- Mike?
- Mike Chat.

406
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,585
- Mike Chat. All right.
- Yeah.

407
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:24,224
- Cool, I'll check it out.
- Hold the door, please.

408
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:27,155
Oh, sure, no problem, Lina.
That's what I'm here for, right?

409
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,592
Thank you so much, Ralph.

410
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,807
- Thank you.
- Sure.

411
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:53,544
New au pair in 3G.
She's from Stockholm.

412
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,411
Got you.

413
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:01,887
Mike Chat knows that showmanship is huge
in the martial-arts tournaments.

414
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,954
In fact, Mike's the Tony Hawk
of martial arts.

415
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:09,989
The guy who changed the game.
And he's Matt's teacher.

416
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,628
Mike pioneered XMA,
Xtreme Martial Arts.

417
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,728
He's rooted in the fundamentals...

418
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,839
- Hey, Mom?
- Hey.

419
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,708
- I was thinking I kind of need a haircut.
- A haircut?

420
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,007
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll do it in the morning.

421
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:38,116
See, this was a sensitive subject
around our house...

422
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:39,512
...because up until now...

423
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,484
...my mom's actually given me
every haircut I've ever had.

424
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:45,316
Not to say she hasn't learned
a thing or two over the years.

425
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:47,823
But lately it's been occurring to me...

426
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:51,985
...that she's not exactly
what we might call a professional.

427
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:58,259
Actually, I was, you know, kind of thinking
maybe we could go out for one.

428
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:02,530
- Out?
- Yeah, you know, like, to a barbershop.

429
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:06,872
- You mean, pay for it?
- Well, not an expensive one.

430
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:09,540
Don't be ridiculous, honey.
I can cut your hair.

431
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:17,815
Hey, Dad, I really think it's time
that Mom stops cutting my hair.

432
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:19,541
Don't you?

433
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:23,678
The thing about Giambi,
I don't trust that damn guy.

434
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:26,220
I don't trust him going to that bag.

435
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,154
He's got bat, no doubt about that.

436
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:31,657
What do you think
we ought to do with this guy?

437
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,160
Could you take it higher
over the ears, please?

438
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,853
- No problem.
- Thanks.

439
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:39,557
Best $12 I ever spent.

440
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:41,964
Look at me. I was hot.

441
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,834
- Our ball.
- What the heck?

442
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:49,601
- Hey, man, it's a legitimate foul.
- Dude, you just totally hacked me.

443
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,140
No.

444
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,335
Look, I don't need you losers.

445
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,911
Okay, maybe I was a little excitable...

446
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,847
...but I didn't wanna get bruised up
before my big karate practice.

447
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:04,382
Hey, Rosemary. Hey there, pretty lady.

448
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:09,218
How's it going, girl?
Hey, Rosemary Telesco.

449
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,359
I got it.

450
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:19,261
Mr. Gabe, I got a Rosemary
down here for you.

451
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,764
Send her up, Ralph.

452
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:26,562
- I loathe myself for feeling like I did.
- Hey.

453
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:29,798
I mean, this is crazy.
She's a girl, for God's sake.

454
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:33,205
It's not like she's a New York Knick
or something.

455
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:38,673
- Hey.
- Hey.

456
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,282
My mom dropped me off.

457
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,816
She's gonna pick me up at 5:15
if that's okay.

458
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,453
Yeah, sure, whenever is fine.

459
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:52,720
All right, let's go.

460
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,861
So do you remember the old place?

461
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:58,224
- Yeah, it's been a long time.
- Yeah, it has.

462
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,297
Mom, this is Rosemary Telesco.
You remember her, don't you?

463
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:17,440
From kindergarten, of course.
I haven't seen you in forever.

464
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:20,442
Look at you, Rosie. You're all grown up.

465
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:23,380
- Hi, Mrs. Burton.
- We're practicing karate.

466
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,012
Excuse me.

467
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:32,822
- Yes.
- Ronny's here. Should I bring him up?

468
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:36,017
Oh, okay.

469
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:43,562
I didn't know you were having a play date
or I wouldn't have made plans.

470
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:47,465
- Should I stay?
- It's not a play date, Mom. It's practice.

471
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,837
- Do you need snacks?
- No, we're fine. Don't worry about us.

472
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,135
Okay.

473
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,473
- Who's Ronny?
- My mom has got a date.

474
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:02,909
Hey. Hey, big guy.

475
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,081
Ronny, this is Gabe's friend,
Rosemary Telesco.

476
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:09,721
- Nice to meet you, Rosemary Telesco.
- You too.

477
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,456
You want me to hold this for you?

478
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:16,684
Oh, thank you. I'll just get my coat.

479
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:23,558
Is there anything more excruciating than
you and your date and your mom's date...

480
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:26,326
...all hanging out
with absolutely nothing to say?

481
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:30,639
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Okay, kiddo?

482
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,638
Okay, that's more excruciating.

483
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:39,437
I'll be back in time for dinner.

484
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

485
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:44,409
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:55,352
- I didn't know your parents were divorced.
- Well, they're not officially.

487
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:58,494
See, it's kind of this long-term project
they've been working on...

488
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,253
...for, like, a year and a half now.

489
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,024
And my mom's decided that
she's finally gotta move on with her life.

490
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:07,497
- That sucks.
- Well, it is what it is, you know.

491
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:09,761
Hey, you wanna see something funny?

492
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:14,396
A few weeks earlier, my mother had left
her Match.com file open on her desktop.

493
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:18,771
See, this is a list of all the 45-year-old men
in New York who are looking for wives.

494
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,913
Most of them are looking
for their second or even third.

495
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,105
These are the ones my mom picked out.

496
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:26,409
They all look like the same guy to me.

497
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:30,718
- Yeah, she's kind of got a type.
- Oh, my God, there's Ronny.

498
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:35,281
"I'm a real live wire who tends
to take everything in life up a notch.

499
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,654
I like being quiet and contemplative,
but rowdy and spontaneous."

500
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,295
Enough of my mother
and her romantic dead ends.

501
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:46,399
Today was about me and Rosemary.
She was in my house, all alone.

502
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,160
It was time for us to fight.

503
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,683
Sparring that day, I was channeling
none other than the great one himself...

504
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:15,516
...my master, my inspiration,
Mr. Mike Chat.

505
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,192
It's a dance, Gabriel.
You lead her, not she lead you.

506
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,485
Kiss her. Kiss her.

507
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,650
I can't, that's disgusting.

508
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:05,791
Trust me, not disgusting.

509
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:13,293
How could you let her do that?

510
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,496
Girls mature faster than boys.

511
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:19,766
Baloney! Don't let her brainwash
you with that.

512
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:21,603
Boys stronger.

513
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,843
I had absolutely no idea
what she was thinking.

514
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:27,242
She was this total mystery to me.

515
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,144
Did I want to kiss Rosemary Telesco?

516
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:32,682
Yes, I guess I did.

517
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:35,320
I wanted to.
More than anything on earth.

518
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:38,619
Do you...

519
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,926
...want some Gatorade?

520
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:49,265
Who was I kidding, anyway?
Was I really gonna kiss her?

521
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,597
I mean, come on, she's 11, I'm 10.

522
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:55,760
Well, 10 and three-quarters, actually.
She's May, I'm September.

523
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:57,872
What do all the different names mean?

524
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,906
Oh, it's my mom's stuff
and my dad's stuff.

525
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:04,067
- Isn't that hard?
- Oh, no, not really.

526
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:06,041
I mean, I can choose
from either of them.

527
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,443
No, I mean, having them
still living together?

528
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,206
I might be falling in love
with the woman.

529
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,544
Doesn't mean I'm in the mood
for soul-searching.

530
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:15,811
Don't you think it's gonna be
so much better once it's all over?

531
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,215
What do you mean?

532
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,153
I don't know.
Like, getting your life started again.

533
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,824
I guess so, yeah.

534
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:26,154
Well, who do you think's
gonna move out?

535
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:29,529
I don't know. My dad, I guess.

536
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:33,600
- Has he looked at any places yet?
- I don't think so.

537
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,033
Hey, maybe we should look for him.

538
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:41,930
Turns out Rosemary's parents, their
favorite hobby was looking at apartments.

539
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,666
They never actually buy anything...

540
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:46,242
...but every Sunday for
as long as she can remember...

541
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:49,347
...they dragged her to open houses.
She knew what everything meant.

542
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,813
- "WBF"?
- Wood-burning fireplace. That's good.

543
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,816
- How much?
- Way too expensive, that's how much.

544
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,681
Yeah.

545
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:02,056
Estate condition is scary.
It means it has to be gutted.

546
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,692
- This is nice.
- What?

547
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,693
Romantic treetop view,
attic loft, hardwood floors.

548
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:11,194
It's a little downtown,
but there's two bedrooms...

549
00:36:11,365 --> 00:36:13,196
...so you can stay over
whenever you want.

550
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,232
- Should we call?
- Call?

551
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:20,934
- Hello, Isaac Properties.
- Yes, Isaac?

552
00:36:21,106 --> 00:36:24,701
We wanted to arrange to see
the "romantic treetop view."

553
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,445
Something right in the range
of your place.

554
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:31,172
- Yes.
- Maybe it is true.

555
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:35,249
Maybe girls do mature faster than boys.
Could I talk like that?

556
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:37,446
How's tomorrow afternoon for you?

557
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:41,484
Tomorrow, for me? Let's see...

558
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:45,985
- It's good.
- Yes, that'd be perfect.

559
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:48,923
Three o'clock? See you there.

560
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:50,722
Three o'clock tomorrow.

561
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:52,653
All right.

562
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,892
Quick.

563
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,996
Here. Here, hurry. Hurry!

564
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:02,599
G-man, you back here?

565
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:05,901
I got some new kicking tees.
They're titanium.

566
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,845
- How's it going?
- Good.

567
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:14,379
Dad, you remember
Rosemary Telesco, right?

568
00:37:18,118 --> 00:37:19,915
From kindergarten.

569
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:21,577
- Sure.
- Hey.

570
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,222
Hi.

571
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,681
Long time, no see.

572
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,826
She's in my karate class, Dad.

573
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:31,228
Cool.

574
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:36,489
But she wasn't just
in my karate class anymore.

575
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,831
Oh, no. She was in my life.

576
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:43,200
We were going out to look for
an apartment for my father tomorrow.

577
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:46,398
These are things
boyfriends and girlfriends do.

578
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:50,066
What other things do
boyfriends and girlfriends do?

579
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:55,039
Someone need a ride?

580
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:58,613
So I'll see you tomorrow, 2:30.

581
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,609
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

582
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:07,587
Are there any more beautiful words
in the English dictionary...

583
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:10,056
...than "see you tomorrow"?

584
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,025
Oh, the plan was perfect.

585
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:15,556
She would tell her friend Libby
to say Rosemary was over at her house.

586
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:17,497
Just from, like, 2:30
to around dinnertime.

587
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,294
See, Libby had a grandmother
who took care of her...

588
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:23,700
...and who was literally deaf
and would never hear the phone if it rang.

589
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,066
So her story was solid.

590
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,332
Let's try Anagrammed Birds for 200.

591
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,068
I would tell my friend
Max Kovinsky to cover for me.

592
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:32,211
The only possible flaw in my plan...

593
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:36,280
...was that I didn't actually
have the guts to tell Max...

594
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,177
...that I was hanging out with a girl.

595
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,581
So, you know, I, like,
never actually had the conversation.

596
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,518
Luckily, I knew Max was going
to Six Flags for the entire day.

597
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,116
I got this.

598
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,727
So I knew he wasn't gonna accidentally
call looking for me or anything.

599
00:38:57,732 --> 00:39:01,463
You ride the subway
a lot without any grownups?

600
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:04,502
Actually, no.

601
00:39:04,672 --> 00:39:06,264
I...

602
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,101
I do it all the time, you know.
It's much more fun this way.

603
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:12,937
I didn't have the heart to tell her
I'd never been south of West 72nd.

604
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,738
I felt she needed my leadership.

605
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,246
Greenwich Village might
as well have been 1000 miles away.

606
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:27,682
I think we might've gotten off
a stop or two early.

607
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:33,117
Do you..? Do you want to ride?

608
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:36,422
- Do you think we can both fit?
- We can try.

609
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:39,491
Come on. Get on.

610
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,071
With that girl's arms around me,
there was nothing I couldn't do.

611
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:58,770
I think it's this way.

612
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:04,817
With the possible exception of finding
that apartment we were looking for.

613
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,293
Deja vu.

614
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:18,628
Maybe we should ask for directions.

615
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:22,056
No, I think it's just right up
this alley right here.

616
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:25,593
You are so like all the guys in my family.

617
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,972
- That your girlfriend?
- Excuse me?

618
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:38,443
Is she your girl?

619
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:42,273
Yeah, my girlfriend.

620
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:46,713
I had a girlfriend once upon a time too.

621
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:48,718
She trampled my heart.

622
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,480
Left me bleeding on the floor.

623
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,251
- Run.
- What?

624
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:56,155
Run while you still can, brother.

625
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,818
Take my advice.

626
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:00,590
Make like the wind.

627
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:05,900
You were close. One block, a left,
and then another left.

628
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,696
Let's go.

629
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,247
Are you Isaac?

630
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:26,150
I'm Rosemary.
We're here to see the apartment.

631
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,084
- Am I getting Punk'd?
- No, it's for my dad.

632
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:32,120
And will Daddy be meeting us here?

633
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,691
- He will if I give him the high sign.
- Trying to make a commission or not?

634
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:43,126
We do a nice business
in two-bedrooms with divorced fathers.

635
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:47,496
This place will be gone
in a New York minute, I promise you.

636
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:50,235
Wood-burning fireplace.

637
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:53,964
Yeah, I noticed.

638
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:57,770
I didn't know what
we were looking for exactly.

639
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:59,707
What do you think?

640
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,107
I like it.

641
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:03,578
It's nice, amazing.

642
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:05,216
But I knew one thing for certain.

643
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:06,612
Yeah.

644
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:10,481
It was the most romantic
treetop view I ever saw.

645
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:18,816
We came home up the bike path
along the Hudson. Sixty-seven blocks.

646
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:23,397
The most physically grueling experience
in my short life on this planet.

647
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:25,761
But I barely felt it.

648
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:29,596
I never felt so ridiculously wonderful.

649
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:34,568
This was New York
the way I always want to remember it.

650
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:38,871
A place where anything is possible.
The city of dreams.

651
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:14,872
- What's this?
- Oh, this?

652
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,734
You don't know about this?

653
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:19,240
It's the smallest park in New York City.

654
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,469
Some commissioner died
and left his whole townhouse...

655
00:43:22,646 --> 00:43:24,841
...to be knocked down for a park.

656
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:27,606
How come I didn't know about this?

657
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:30,378
Nobody on your side of Broadway
ever comes over this way.

658
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:32,884
That's what's so cool
about West End.

659
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:48,232
- Do you come here a lot?
- Actually, I...

660
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,530
I haven't been here in quite a while.

661
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:01,909
Hey, Mini Me.

662
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:04,869
What are you doing in my park?

663
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:07,913
Oh, no way.
Not Daryl Kitzens. Not now.

664
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,674
It's a public park.

665
00:44:09,851 --> 00:44:12,183
What's she doing? Inciting him?

666
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:15,378
Didn't she know that
wild animals need to be placated?

667
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:19,154
I think this park's
big enough for all of us, right?

668
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,952
Who were we kidding?

669
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:23,060
A white belt and a yellow belt...

670
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:26,789
...facing off against
the Darth Maul of P.S. 87.

671
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,556
We were gonna get creamed.

672
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,932
You picked the wrong park, little man.

673
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,834
Get the hell out my park.

674
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:42,337
You're dead!

675
00:44:54,453 --> 00:44:57,388
Come on. Run, run, hurry.

676
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:03,425
Hop on. Go, go, go.

678
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:09,644
He's coming, he's coming!

679
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,074
Go faster, he's coming!

680
00:45:17,254 --> 00:45:19,983
- Make the light.
- Hold on.

681
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,271
We were both still flushed
from our day of adventure.

682
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,409
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

683
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,167
I could do battle with Daryl Kitzens...

684
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,575
...so why can't I just lean in to her?

685
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:52,005
Do it. Do it, you wimp. Do it!

686
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,685
That was fun.

687
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,686
Yeah, it was.

688
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,581
Scared he's gonna hunt us down?

689
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,725
I just have to keep a low profile
for the rest of the summer.

690
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:07,725
And, of course, transfer
to a military school in the fall.

691
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:11,687
I just have to keep a low profile
for one more week.

692
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:13,493
A week?

693
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,760
Well, next Sunday, after the wedding,
I'm going to camp.

694
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:19,035
Camp?

695
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:20,637
For how long?

696
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:24,138
- For six weeks.
- Six weeks?

697
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:26,469
She might as well have said she's dying.

698
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:30,643
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

699
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:52,058
- I better get inside.
- Yeah.

700
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,823
- Good night.
- Good night.

701
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,818
What if she goes to camp
and I never get to kiss her?

702
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:21,249
That's the way it's gonna be.
It's so obvious.

703
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,946
Every opportunity I have
will go the same way:

704
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:25,522
"Good night."
"Good night."

705
00:47:25,691 --> 00:47:27,750
No, I will not let that happen.

706
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:30,258
I will kiss her before
she gets on that bus to Maine.

707
00:47:30,395 --> 00:47:32,295
I will, I will, I will!

708
00:47:43,206 --> 00:47:44,867
Gabe?

709
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:49,137
That's him, there he is. Oh, thank God.
If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.

710
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:53,542
So it turns out Max Kovinsky
didn't go to Six Flags after all.

711
00:47:53,714 --> 00:47:54,942
He got sick.

712
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:58,278
My mother actually ended up
running into his mother at the Fairway...

713
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,816
...and, well, they got to talking.

714
00:48:00,986 --> 00:48:02,419
What?

715
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:06,452
Gabe, come here. Come here.

716
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:11,823
Don't you ever go anywhere again
without us knowing where you are.

717
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:14,930
Do you hear me?
You had us scared half to death.

718
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:18,624
My punishment?
No phone, no TV...

719
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:21,462
...no leaving the apartment for 48 hours.

720
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:24,264
It was the first thing my parents
agreed on in a long time.

721
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:26,429
- Please.
- Do I have to call Rosemary's mother?

722
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:27,801
No, don't call anyone.

723
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:30,910
I thought we had an understanding
on the nine square blocks.

724
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,204
- We do.
- That's the only way that this can work.

725
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:35,574
I had to throw myself
on the mercy of the court...

726
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:38,113
...to get special permission
to go to karate class.

727
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:41,047
I'll do anything. I'll wash dishes
for the rest of the summer.

728
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,207
I promise I will.

729
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,289
It just wasn't an option to miss that class.

730
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,490
You scared the hell out of us today.

731
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,684
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, what does sorry mean?

732
00:48:52,861 --> 00:48:54,590
Sorry means I'm not gonna do it again.

733
00:48:54,763 --> 00:48:56,162
- Right, never again.
- Right.

734
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:58,264
- Right?
- Right.

735
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,663
- Dad?
- Yeah?

736
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:03,425
Are?

737
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,161
Are you gonna move out?

738
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:11,941
Eventually, yeah, I am, Gabe.

739
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,976
Well, I...

740
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:17,979
- I found an apartment for you.
- You what?

741
00:49:18,382 --> 00:49:22,216
That's where I went today.
To look for an apartment for you.

742
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:25,748
- Do you want me to move out?
- No, no, of course not.

743
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:32,224
But, you know, maybe we can't get
our lives started again until you do.

744
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:36,223
Where do you get such big ideas?

745
00:49:37,097 --> 00:49:40,725
- I don't know. I just get them.
- So where is this apartment?

746
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,528
It's a two-bedroom on Grove Street.

747
00:49:43,703 --> 00:49:44,930
In the Village?

748
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:47,697
- Yeah, wood-burning fireplace.
- No way.

749
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:51,035
- Why not?
- It's too far from you, champ.

750
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:54,507
I wouldn't move more than...

751
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:57,647
...a three- or four-block radius from you.

752
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:00,775
You're gonna have to go college
to get farther away from me.

753
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:04,276
- Okay?
- Okay.

754
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,985
- Go to sleep.
- All right.

755
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:11,483
So, what's the deal with this Rosemary?

756
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,353
Rosemary?

757
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,357
How do you mean?

758
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:21,661
Nothing, I'm just not used to...

759
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:23,732
We do karate together, Dad.

760
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,629
She's my sparring partner.

761
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:31,997
- Okay, great.
- I didn't even pick her.

762
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:34,799
Whatever you say, kid.

763
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,738
That night, I had this dream.

764
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:50,414
All right, yeah!

765
00:50:54,392 --> 00:50:57,053
- I'm open, man!
- Gabe.

766
00:50:57,961 --> 00:50:59,223
I'm open, Gabe.

767
00:51:00,397 --> 00:51:02,364
Over here.

768
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:05,328
I'm open here. I'm open, man.
Where are you?

769
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:06,729
Gabe.

770
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:09,563
Gabe. Gabe.

771
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:18,267
Where you going?
You're ditching us for her?

772
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,411
Come on!

773
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:27,449
Disgusting.

774
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:36,452
The next day, I couldn't
get to class fast enough.

775
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,593
I was gonna be near her again.

776
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:41,127
Grapple with her, smell her hair.

777
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:46,425
That day, the gates of hell opened,
and Tim Staples walked right through.

778
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:51,230
So we're gonna shift sparring partners
to make sure everyone's with their level.

779
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:54,464
That means, Tim, you'll be with Rosemary.

780
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,902
Could this be?

781
00:51:56,075 --> 00:51:58,975
My woman getting ripped
from my hands like this.

782
00:51:59,144 --> 00:52:00,736
I could see where all this leads.

783
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:04,574
Do you, Rosemary Telesco,
take Tim Staples...

784
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,613
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

785
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:10,879
No! Rosemary!

786
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:15,854
And, Gabe, your new sparring partner
will be David Betanahu.

787
00:52:16,024 --> 00:52:19,084
This is my level? David Betanahu?

788
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,921
How could this happen?

789
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:22,960
She's with Ashton Kutcher over there...

790
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,893
...and I'm with the sweatiest

791
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:28,899
The kid's practically had
a mustache since nursery school.

792
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,200
Everything I took for granted,
stolen in a New York minute.

793
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:43,810
Somehow, karate wasn't quite
the same without Rosemary.

794
00:52:45,815 --> 00:52:48,943
So how was that class for you?

795
00:52:49,118 --> 00:52:50,675
Was it a good one?

796
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,010
I'm having a little trouble
with this maete zuki maneuver.

797
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:55,917
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

798
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,456
I couldn't resist.
I needed more and more pain.

799
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,787
So how's that Tim guy
at the maete zuki?

800
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:03,986
He's a lot better than me.

801
00:53:04,163 --> 00:53:06,687
But he wants us to practice together.

802
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:08,856
Oh, really?

803
00:53:09,034 --> 00:53:13,595
Well, that's terrific.
You know, hey, when can we get together?

804
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:18,004
Well, I've got cello this afternoon,
so not today.

805
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:20,836
Cello?
But I thought cello was on Saturdays?

806
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,374
Tuesday and Saturday.

807
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:24,637
She can't cancel a freaking cello lesson?

808
00:53:24,813 --> 00:53:27,747
Doesn't she know our days are numbered
before that bus to camp?

809
00:53:27,915 --> 00:53:31,282
- How about I'll call you?
- Sure, sounds great.

810
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:36,716
So that's it?
Just a lousy "call you"?

811
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,789
Not even an "I'll call you."

812
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,153
A "how about I'll call you?"

813
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:44,318
What on earth does that mean?
When?

814
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:49,526
You have no new messages.

815
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:54,965
What choice did I have
but to return to my old, miserable life?

816
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:57,766
Wait a minute, you were happy.

817
00:53:57,939 --> 00:53:59,770
Oh, please, I was miserable.

818
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:03,432
I just didn't know how miserable I was.

819
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:06,473
Heads up!

820
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:08,478
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

821
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,747
Where's your head today, G-man?

822
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:17,351
- My head?
- Yeah, it's not with the ball. What was that?

823
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,213
It's not my head, Dad.

824
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:24,258
- It's my leg. I hurt it in karate class.
- Karate.

825
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,362
See, guys like us,
we weren't built for kicking bricks.

826
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:31,432
Let's keep our priorities in line.
Eyes on the prize.

827
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:35,968
Head down.
Go, sweet spot, one, two...

828
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:39,129
He was right.
My priorities were all screwed up.

829
00:54:39,306 --> 00:54:40,534
I was an athlete.

830
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:42,334
- I just had to shake it off.
- Yeah.

831
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,445
Look at me. I can bounce back.

832
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:50,046
I don't need some girl in my life
for me to be happy.

833
00:54:58,455 --> 00:55:01,321
Hello. Yeah.

834
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:06,118
You know, I really hate it when people
call me at home and try to sell me stuff.

835
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:10,929
That's okay. Okay, bye.

836
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:21,671
Hello?

837
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:24,375
Hi.

838
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,601
Yeah, he's right here.

839
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:28,177
Gabe?

840
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,972
It's a girl.

841
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:40,349
- I got it.
- Got it?

842
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:42,183
I got it!

843
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,288
- Hey.
- I said I was gonna call.

844
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:50,191
Did you? I don't even remember.

845
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:53,264
Smooth under pressure, that's me.

846
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,834
If only I could do something
about the beating of my heart.

847
00:55:57,002 --> 00:55:58,765
Could she hear that through the phone?

848
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:01,497
So, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

849
00:56:02,107 --> 00:56:03,471
- Tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

850
00:56:03,641 --> 00:56:06,906
It's summer, so it's not,
like, a school night or anything.

851
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:08,669
I'm free, totally.

852
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:12,406
Because my parents got these special tickets
to this concert with this guy...

853
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,414
...who's supposed to be
the greatest singer in New York.

854
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:18,575
Do you wanna go?

855
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,613
Me and your parents?

856
00:56:21,789 --> 00:56:23,187
And me too.

857
00:56:23,357 --> 00:56:25,621
My mom said
I could invite anyone I want.

858
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,760
- Sounds awesome.
- Great.

859
00:56:27,828 --> 00:56:29,021
She called.

860
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:31,486
She said she was gonna,
and she kept her word.

861
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:33,827
This was not just some figment
of my imagination.

862
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:36,968
Our love is a two-way street.

863
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:46,840
- You're looking sharp there, tiger.
- Like I even care.

864
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,671
Nice.

865
00:56:49,278 --> 00:56:50,506
I especially like the hair.

866
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:56,346
Come on, mess it up.

867
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,881
Don't take all your romantic advice
from him, Gabe.

868
00:57:00,053 --> 00:57:02,578
You look very nice.

869
00:57:03,623 --> 00:57:05,317
I'm gonna wait downstairs.

870
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:08,653
Do you want us to come
say hi to her parents?

871
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:10,225
No.

872
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:13,762
Excuse me. They said
they'd have you home by 11.

873
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:17,196
And if you're gonna be one second later,
I'll need a call.

874
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,130
Okay.

875
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,867
- Our little boy is growing up, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

876
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,840
Pretty snazzy. Big night?

877
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:40,678
Just some date with some girl.
You know, nothing... Nothing big.

878
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:45,084
- That girl who came by here the other day?
- That would be the one.

879
00:57:45,856 --> 00:57:48,916
She was a nice girl,
that girl who came by here.

880
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:51,526
All right, Mr. Gabe.

881
00:57:55,632 --> 00:57:58,464
- Gabe. Nice to see you.
- Hey, you too.

882
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,534
Thanks for joining us.

883
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:03,761
- Hi, Mrs. Telesco.
- Hello. How are you?

884
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,337
Good.

885
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:14,578
Welcome to The Carlyle.

886
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:18,848
Ma'am.

887
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:27,753
Mickey took me here on our third date.

888
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:29,858
We had to stand right over there
by the bar...

889
00:58:30,026 --> 00:58:31,789
...because we couldn't afford a table.

890
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:35,020
From that moment on,
there was no turning back for us.

891
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,734
You're gonna love this guy.
No one sings like Loston Harris.

892
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,698
This guy is New York.

893
00:58:56,414 --> 00:58:58,677
I can't tell you
what that first song was about.

894
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:01,943
Something about love
and a boy and a girl.

895
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,781
And this boy can think of nothing but
holding that girl's hand in the darkness.

896
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:16,560
I'm not sure how I got the courage.

897
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,095
Maybe it was the buzz
in the Shirley Temple.

898
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,062
Maybe it was Loston Harris...

899
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:24,498
...the greatest singer
this little town has ever known.

900
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:27,797
But I knew our relationship
had to get to the next step...

901
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:32,966
...or Rosemary and I would
just remain karate friends forever.

902
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,625
Never had I been so keenly aware...

903
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:57,320
...of the ability of my palm
to manufacture sweat.

904
00:59:57,863 --> 01:00:01,855
But I was determined to hold
that girl's hand for every single second.

905
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,462
What does this mean?
Does she hate me?

906
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:10,801
Is she grossed out by me?
Am I pushing everything way too fast?

907
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:24,417
All those ridiculous songs about love,
I finally understood.

908
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:31,489
Forget the second stop.
We're gonna walk from here too.

909
01:00:31,657 --> 01:00:33,386
Thanks.

910
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,050
Thanks.

911
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:41,023
Well, you guys say
your good nights now...

912
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,658
...and Daddy and I are gonna get some milk
for breakfast tomorrow, okay? So...

913
01:00:46,002 --> 01:00:47,969
Good night, Mrs. Telesco.

914
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:51,937
- Oh, thank you for coming, Gabe.
- Oh, thank you.

915
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,138
Your parents are cool.

916
01:00:56,311 --> 01:00:58,801
Everyone says I'm gonna hate them
in a few years.

917
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:02,972
- Think you will?
- Probably.

918
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:05,549
If people say so.

919
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:07,716
This is the time.

920
01:01:07,886 --> 01:01:09,945
I know it. She knows it.

921
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:11,953
My God, even her parents know it.

922
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:13,351
Why can't I kiss her?

923
01:01:13,524 --> 01:01:17,016
What's stopping me?
Is it cooties I fear?

924
01:01:17,828 --> 01:01:20,091
So, big wedding this weekend.

925
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:23,959
Yeah, right. I forgot about that.

926
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,824
I wish you could come.

927
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:29,799
It's gonna be really boring.

928
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:34,873
Yeah, I really want to see you
do your flower-girl thing.

929
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,039
Part of me is sure I'm gonna tr...

930
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,705
Did..? Did I do it right?

931
01:01:47,218 --> 01:01:51,085
I don't know.
I've absolutely nothing to compare it to.

932
01:01:51,255 --> 01:01:52,688
My God, was I even close?

933
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:56,086
I... I should go.

934
01:01:56,859 --> 01:01:58,190
Yeah.

935
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:03,663
- Good night.
- Good night.

936
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,165
Hey, how was your night, little Romeo?

937
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,503
It was good. It was great.

938
01:02:18,677 --> 01:02:21,372
Fine, I think.

939
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,410
But I had no idea.

940
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:29,075
I kept playing the moment
over and over and over in my head.

941
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:33,879
Was it too fast? Too hard? Too gross?

942
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:36,046
Did she actually want me to kiss her?

943
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:38,488
I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.

944
01:02:39,027 --> 01:02:40,824
Or did I scare her away?

945
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:44,191
I had it bad. This new feeling
deep in the pit of my stomach.

946
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:46,263
This horrible lovesickness.

947
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:52,292
Maybe this is what cooties are.

948
01:02:52,804 --> 01:02:55,170
By the next day, I was a wreck.

949
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:57,001
I purposely didn't call her.

950
01:02:57,174 --> 01:03:01,076
Okay, except for one hang-up.
Because I knew I would see her in karate.

951
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,036
I got to class 10 minutes early.

952
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:11,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

953
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:15,478
Okay, I knew what
I was doing here early.

954
01:03:15,656 --> 01:03:18,180
But what was he?

955
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:20,053
One thing was clear.

956
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:24,595
This business had to be settled
right here and right now.

957
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,526
Staples.

958
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:14,664
If only life was so simple.

959
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:19,967
Three-oh-nine. She's not even coming.

960
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:21,836
She doesn't even wanna see me.

961
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,035
She's blowing off class. She hates me.

962
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:27,840
Your fist should be like a hammer.

963
01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:32,039
She came. She's here. She loves me.

964
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,852
- Sorry I'm late.
- Miss Telesco, nice of you to join us.

965
01:04:41,025 --> 01:04:43,118
Wait a minute. What was that?

966
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:47,730
Was that a smile?
Or is she, like, mad at me?

967
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:51,127
Why would she be mad at me?
I only kissed her.

968
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,396
Why the heck did I kiss her?
What was I possibly thinking?

969
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:02,705
There are very few things more painful
than watching the woman you love...

970
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,571
...grapple with another man.

971
01:05:04,744 --> 01:05:06,870
Actually, I take that back.

972
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:09,446
There are no things more painful.

973
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:12,606
The answer lies within you,
Gabriel, and you alone.

974
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,581
You must find your strength.

975
01:05:14,752 --> 01:05:18,016
Your focus. Your determination.

976
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:25,721
Poor David Betanahu.
He was just an innocent victim in all this.

977
01:05:25,895 --> 01:05:28,454
Collateral damage in this love affair.

978
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:32,690
One, two, three, four.

979
01:05:32,866 --> 01:05:34,731
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

980
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:36,199
- High block.
- She loves me.

981
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,338
- Middle punch.
- She loves me not.

982
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:41,200
- Side kick.
- She loves me.

983
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:45,007
Loves me not. She loves me.

984
01:05:45,177 --> 01:05:48,270
Not. Not. Loves. Not.

985
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:52,882
By 3:51, I had descended
fully into madness.

986
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,609
- Who wants to take their yellow-belt exam?
- Me!

987
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,978
Ah, Gabe, the moment
of reckoning is upon us.

988
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:05,319
Okay, maybe I was a little overeager.
But it was my only way back to her.

989
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,420
Luckily, I had the great
master of masters in my corner.

990
01:06:10,864 --> 01:06:12,229
Very nice, very nice.

991
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:14,798
- Let's see your maete zuki now.
- Gabriel, switch.

992
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:17,435
Hit, hit, sweep.

993
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:24,106
Very nice. Very nice.

994
01:06:24,274 --> 01:06:25,832
You've come a long way.

995
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,144
Excellent, Gabriel. Excellent.

996
01:06:30,146 --> 01:06:32,910
Now, time for the break.

997
01:06:33,082 --> 01:06:35,515
All that stood between me
and the woman I loved...

998
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:38,517
...was a half-inch piece of plywood.

999
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,479
Be the board, Gabe. Be the board.

1000
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,589
At that moment, I was the board.

1001
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:10,276
The pain! The pain! Oh, my God!

1002
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:21,652
I don't remember much after that.

1003
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:25,383
- Gabe.
- Damn. They said I blacked out.

1004
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:40,430
Hi.

1005
01:07:43,572 --> 01:07:46,541
I guess this is the end of karate, huh?

1006
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:49,366
I'm a place-kicker.

1007
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:53,502
If you work hard, you can achieve anything.
I really believe that, Gabe.

1008
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,705
Whatever.

1009
01:07:56,783 --> 01:08:01,947
Hey, I came as soon as I got the message.
What happened?

1010
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:05,578
He went a little too hard
for his yellow belt.

1011
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,691
Sounds like we're gonna need some
ice cream on the way home, huh?

1012
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,395
No, thanks.

1013
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,764
Was this it?

1014
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,333
Was this the end for me and Rosemary?

1015
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:23,698
Two and a half weeks was all the time
we were going to be allowed?

1016
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:26,863
I was not gonna call her.
That would be weak.

1017
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:30,498
And I resolved that night
to be weak no longer.

1018
01:08:31,077 --> 01:08:32,408
Hello.

1019
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:35,877
- Hello, Mrs. Burton?
- No, this is Gabe.

1020
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:39,608
Who cares if she thought I was my mother?
It was her.

1021
01:08:40,151 --> 01:08:42,119
- Hello?
- No, Mom, I got it.

1022
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,344
- Who is it?
- Mom, I got it. Hang up now.

1023
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:46,284
Okay, hon.

1024
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:50,258
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your hand?

1025
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:53,054
My hand? Oh, it's fine, barely hurt.

1026
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,561
I just got so worried
when you lost consciousness.

1027
01:08:56,731 --> 01:08:59,131
Yeah, that was only like
for a second or so.

1028
01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:01,324
What color cast did you get?

1029
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:03,732
Plain was the best of my choices.

1030
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:05,837
My cousin got this Hulk one.

1031
01:09:06,172 --> 01:09:09,073
Yeah, they had that too,
but I'm not at all really into the Hulk.

1032
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:13,507
This was no time for small talk.
It was time to lay things on the table.

1033
01:09:13,678 --> 01:09:17,204
To reach through that phone line
and dig deep into that woman's soul.

1034
01:09:17,381 --> 01:09:19,440
So when can we hang out?

1035
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:24,118
- It's a really crazy weekend for me.
- It is?

1036
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:26,754
It's Thursday night.
She's going to camp Sunday morning.

1037
01:09:26,922 --> 01:09:28,480
Who cares how crazy the weekend is?

1038
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:30,124
Rehearsal dinner tomorrow night.

1039
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:33,421
Wedding on Saturday, camp on Sunday.

1040
01:09:33,594 --> 01:09:35,823
Sure. Right, of course.

1041
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:38,089
Where's "wish you could
come to the wedding"?

1042
01:09:38,265 --> 01:09:40,392
Where's that Rosemary?
The Rosemary I loved.

1043
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,796
Not this alien with her crazy weekends.

1044
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:45,459
Your new sparring partner,
is he coming to the wedding?

1045
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,664
- What? Tim?
- Oh, is that what you call him?

1046
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,967
Are you calling him
after you call me?

1047
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:52,506
What are you talking about?

1048
01:09:52,676 --> 01:09:55,167
I'm talking about you and Tim Staples
sitting in a tree.

1049
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:57,403
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

1050
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,775
First comes love,
then comes marriage...

1051
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:02,178
...then comes Tim Staples
and a baby carriage.

1052
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,817
You sound crazy, you know that?

1053
01:10:03,985 --> 01:10:05,680
Why don't you have time this weekend?

1054
01:10:05,854 --> 01:10:08,981
I'm sorry, Gabe.
I haven't even started packing.

1055
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:12,086
- You know what, I hate you.
- What?

1056
01:10:12,258 --> 01:10:15,125
I hate you. Why do you even care?
I hate you!

1057
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,922
- Well, I hate you too.
- I hate you more.

1058
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:23,230
How can you say something so mean?
I hate you!

1059
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,876
Oh, Rosemary.

1060
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:50,514
Rosemary!

1061
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,096
You want to, or should I?

1062
01:11:07,804 --> 01:11:09,828
Rosemary.

1063
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:13,799
It was the pain that had no name.

1064
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:21,571
Why did Rosemary Telesco
ever have to walk into my life?

1065
01:11:21,748 --> 01:11:24,773
Why, why, why?

1066
01:11:28,687 --> 01:11:34,181
Maybe not everything
is supposed to last forever.

1067
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:37,456
Certain things are like...

1068
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:42,088
Like skywriting.
Like a really beautiful thing...

1069
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:46,199
...that lasts for a couple moments
and then... you know?

1070
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:49,636
Oh, sweetie.

1071
01:11:54,575 --> 01:11:58,101
- Mommy.
- I know, honey.

1072
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:01,610
- Love sucks.
- Yeah.

1073
01:12:09,353 --> 01:12:10,411
Look at them all.

1074
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:13,145
Rats in their cages.

1075
01:12:13,323 --> 01:12:15,553
Their lives destroyed by love.

1076
01:12:15,725 --> 01:12:17,589
I'm done with it.

1077
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:20,922
I won't be like them.

1078
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,794
The fools.

1079
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:29,331
I remember my first girl.

1080
01:12:29,503 --> 01:12:30,731
We met on the Jersey shore.

1081
01:12:30,904 --> 01:12:32,962
But she was from Philly,
I was from Brooklyn...

1082
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:35,630
...so we knew right from the start
we were cursed.

1083
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:37,775
Ralph, not right now.
I'm not in the mood.

1084
01:12:38,777 --> 01:12:40,335
Okay.

1085
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,763
It's amazing how quickly time moves.

1086
01:13:50,935 --> 01:13:53,768
Just yesterday, I thought I loved her.

1087
01:13:53,938 --> 01:13:57,600
But now I don't even
care about her at all.

1088
01:14:17,323 --> 01:14:21,053
The next morning, this kind of
amazing thing happened.

1089
01:14:21,226 --> 01:14:23,717
The sun came out again.

1090
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:27,926
See, life is about so much more
than Rosemary.

1091
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:33,166
I had my family, my health,
my kicking career.

1092
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,696
I really had no room
for a woman in my life.

1093
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,665
How about some rocky road?

1094
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,932
I guess.

1095
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,504
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1096
01:14:48,681 --> 01:14:53,674
What's the deal with girls?
I mean, why are they the way they are?

1097
01:14:56,788 --> 01:14:59,188
You're talking to the wrong man.

1098
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:04,559
Well, how come all love has to end?

1099
01:15:14,269 --> 01:15:15,896
Let me...

1100
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:19,639
Let me tell you something
about me and your mom.

1101
01:15:20,274 --> 01:15:24,266
Once upon a time,
we really loved each other.

1102
01:15:25,611 --> 01:15:30,604
But as time went by,
there just got to be all these things...

1103
01:15:30,782 --> 01:15:35,878
Little things.
Stupid things that were left unsaid.

1104
01:15:36,053 --> 01:15:40,682
And all these things
that were left unsaid piled up like...

1105
01:15:40,857 --> 01:15:42,916
Like the clutter in our storage room.

1106
01:15:43,092 --> 01:15:46,788
And after a while, there was so much
that was left unsaid...

1107
01:15:46,962 --> 01:15:50,727
...that we barely said anything at all.

1108
01:15:51,532 --> 01:15:54,694
Well, why didn't you
just say them then, Dad?

1109
01:15:57,604 --> 01:15:59,696
I don't know, Gabe.

1110
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,466
I kind of wish I had.

1111
01:16:04,442 --> 01:16:08,310
Who was I kidding anyway?
I wasn't gonna get any real comfort here.

1112
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:11,072
I mean, the old guy meant okay.

1113
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,442
Let's knock over a hot dog stand
on the way home.

1114
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,948
Drown our sorrows
in pork shoulders and nitrates.

1115
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:18,518
No, I think that's all right.

1116
01:16:18,688 --> 01:16:21,588
I'm just gonna, I don't know,
hang out here for a while.

1117
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:24,125
Okay, champ.

1118
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,589
- See you at the homestead.
- All right.

1119
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,193
You kicked good today.

1120
01:16:28,362 --> 01:16:30,352
I'm telling you,
the trajectory you're on...

1121
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,122
...to the moon.

1122
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:35,460
- Or at least the Big Ten.
- Thanks.

1123
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:39,464
- It felt good.
- Good. I'll see you at home.

1124
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:46,498
Somewhere a million miles away...

1125
01:16:46,943 --> 01:16:50,606
...the girl I once loved
was going down her road...

1126
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:54,507
...and I was stuck back on mine.

1127
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:45,623
I couldn't escape them,
all the little things I left unsaid.

1128
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:46,815
I was drowning in them.

1129
01:18:02,371 --> 01:18:04,668
Suddenly, I knew what I had to do.

1130
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:10,640
Love isn't about ridiculous little words.
Love is about grand gestures.

1131
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,745
Don't go to Taos. Not without me.

1132
01:18:14,013 --> 01:18:16,413
Love is about airplanes
pulling banners over stadiums.

1133
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:18,907
Proposals on Jumbo Trons.

1134
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:22,720
Giant words in skywriting.

1135
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:27,013
Love is about going that extra mile,
even if it hurts.

1136
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,092
Letting it all hang out there.

1137
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:35,754
Love is about finding courage inside of you
that you didn't even know was there.

1138
01:20:08,105 --> 01:20:09,936
What are you doing here?

1139
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:13,974
You're going to camp tomorrow.
I had to say goodbye.

1140
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:20,844
- But I thought you hate me.
- I don't. I lied.

1141
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:23,276
I wasn't gonna be like my father.

1142
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:27,581
I wasn't gonna let all these things
left unsaid smother me.

1143
01:20:28,255 --> 01:20:29,950
Rosemary...

1144
01:20:33,492 --> 01:20:35,460
...I love you.

1145
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:39,957
- You what?
- I do.

1146
01:20:40,298 --> 01:20:43,926
I'm sorry, but I love you more
than anyone has ever loved.

1147
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,467
I love you. I love you. I love you.

1148
01:20:46,637 --> 01:20:48,764
How's that for letting
it all hang out there.

1149
01:20:49,172 --> 01:20:50,469
And hang...

1150
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,302
...and hang, and hang.

1151
01:20:57,512 --> 01:21:02,574
Do you think you might
wanna love me too?

1152
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:08,282
I don't know what I think, Gabe.
I'm only 11.

1153
01:21:10,322 --> 01:21:13,655
I don't think I'm ready to be in love.

1154
01:21:13,826 --> 01:21:16,487
Well, I'm not ready and I'm doing it.

1155
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:20,187
But it wasn't that easy.
I guess love never is.

1156
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:25,695
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe girls don't mature faster.

1157
01:21:25,868 --> 01:21:28,336
No, they do. They do.
You know they do.

1158
01:21:28,504 --> 01:21:30,562
You even said so at the park.

1159
01:21:30,738 --> 01:21:32,638
We at least mature at the same rate.

1160
01:21:34,342 --> 01:21:37,174
I don't know what mature is anymore.

1161
01:21:41,614 --> 01:21:44,640
But I'm really happy you came.

1162
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:55,019
- Do you wanna dance, Gabe?
- Dance?

1163
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:57,749
Sure, what the hell.

1164
01:22:12,706 --> 01:22:15,903
As I held on to Rosemary Telesco
for dear life...

1165
01:22:16,076 --> 01:22:18,202
...we both knew the truth.

1166
01:22:18,377 --> 01:22:22,813
She was going off to camp
and eventually private school.

1167
01:22:23,047 --> 01:22:25,538
We were on different roads, she and me.

1168
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:27,877
Two ships that passed
in Sheep Meadow.

1169
01:22:41,163 --> 01:22:43,824
See, this is just like I told you.

1170
01:22:43,998 --> 01:22:46,592
Same thing I knew
getting into this whole mess.

1171
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:49,234
Love ends.

1172
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:54,865
- Hey, Mr. Gabe, how goes it?
- Hey, Ralph.

1173
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,234
Hold the door, please.

1174
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:10,474
The truth is, you come
into this world alone...

1175
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:13,417
...and leave it the exact same way.

1176
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,984
I'm home.

1177
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,621
Who are these strangers laughing
in my mother's bedroom?

1178
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,199
I'd only seen them in pictures.

1179
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:12,935
Hi.

1180
01:24:17,707 --> 01:24:20,039
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1181
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:23,974
We were just talking about how horrible
our honeymoon was.

1182
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:25,607
Yeah?

1183
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:29,840
Key West.
Everything that could possibly go wrong...

1184
01:24:30,017 --> 01:24:33,349
An unmitigated disaster.
It wasn't even a tropical storm, it...

1185
01:24:33,519 --> 01:24:35,180
- Remember that?
- Like yesterday.

1186
01:24:35,355 --> 01:24:39,188
It was awful. We lost our luggage.
God, you were so sick.

1187
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,250
God, I'm hungry. What time is it?

1188
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:49,656
- We should get something to eat.
- All of us?

1189
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:53,497
Yeah, we should...

1190
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:55,796
Why don't we go down
to the place on the corner.

1191
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:59,701
Yeah, the place on the corner
sounds good.

1192
01:24:59,874 --> 01:25:03,365
- It's getting cooler out there.
- Yeah, we're gonna need jackets.

1193
01:25:12,752 --> 01:25:16,687
I just cleared some old stuff
out of the storage room.

1194
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:39,901
You wanted a New York love story?

1195
01:25:40,073 --> 01:25:42,541
There's a New York love story for you.

1196
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:45,302
I told you it wasn't gonna be pretty.

1197
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:51,942
Love is an ugly, terrible business
practiced by fools.

1198
01:25:52,116 --> 01:25:55,778
It will trample your heart
and leave you bleeding on the floor.

1199
01:25:55,952 --> 01:25:58,785
And what does it really
get you in the end?

1200
01:25:59,189 --> 01:26:03,955
Nothing but a few incredible memories
that you can't ever shake.

1201
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:14,800
The truth is, there's gonna
be other girls out there.

1202
01:26:14,968 --> 01:26:17,527
I mean, I hope.

1203
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:22,399
But I'm never gonna get
another first love.

1204
01:26:24,142 --> 01:26:27,201
That one's always gonna be her.

1205
01:26:28,201 --> 01:26:38,199
