1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,327
Five minutes,
my little lambs.

2
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,201
Has anyone seen
Bliss Cavendar?

3
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,834
Pash, this can't
be happening.

4
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:49,202
Why aren't you
backstage, Brooke?

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,508
You know how it is.

6
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,742
They get to a certain age,
they don't want you back there.

7
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:55,712
She said
she'll meet me here.

8
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,720
Really? That's odd.

9
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,415
It says "temporary."

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,086
It did a minute ago,
I swear.

11
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,957
My mom is
gonna kill me.

12
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,633
Now, Miss Amber Black

13
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:17,574
If I could have dinner with
anyone, it would have to be God.

14
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,867
Because what they say
is true. God is great.

15
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,114
Don't tell them
that I did it, okay?

16
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,878
Those are the rules,
you're not allowed to tell.

17
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:33,390
Let go.
I'm your only friend.

18
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,322
Corbi Booth,
ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:38,987
If I could have dinner with anyone,
it would have to be my grandfather.

20
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:41,591
I love you, Papa.

21
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,661
And now, also from Bodeen,
Miss Bliss Cavendar.

22
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,518
If I could have
dinner with anyone,

23
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,196
it would be
Amelia Earhart,

24
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:22,031
because not only was she
a pioneer of aviation,

25
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:26,131
but she was a great woman in history.

26
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:29,709
Thank you.

27
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,213
So enlighten me What was
that little stunt all about?

28
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,150
Are you trying to
sabotage your chances?

29
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:44,057
Or was it just your biological urge to
make your mother look like a jackass?

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,218
It was just a dare.

31
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,956
How did that
work out for you?

32
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,793
Not so great?

33
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,465
Corbi

34
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,632
Congratulations, honey
Well-deserved.

35
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,498
Thank you.
Thumbs way up.

36
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,407
Thank you,
Mrs. Cavendar.

37
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:03,644
Bliss is so hard
to beat. Usually.

38
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:07,479
Well, the Blue Bonnet pageant
is right around the corner.

39
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,018
And we'll be there.
Come on, honey.

40
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,018
See you later
See you.

41
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:17,857
I'm sorry that
these pageants

42
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,521
don't live up to your high
moral standards, Bliss,

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,055
but there's a lot you
can learn from them,

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,066
no matter what you
go on to be in life.

45
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:28,365
You think you're being
judged up there on that stage,

46
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,406
but no one's asking you
to be Miss America.

47
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,996
I wanna be Miss America.

48
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,168
And you're gonna be the
best one ever, sweetheart.

49
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:35,369
Teeth.

50
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,036
Eyes.

51
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:48,187
Trudy, bless your heart
for fitting us in.

52
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,586
Well, hell.
Shit happens.

53
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,426
Let me get my foils.

54
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,795
Now, what were you
thinking, getting blue hair?

55
00:03:58,468 --> 00:03:59,867
Fourteenth
drive in the red zone.

56
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,632
They have now given up
nine touchdowns

57
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,798
and three field goals. We'll
see how this one ends up.

58
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,637
He's only had one take away
in the red zone.

59
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,613
Hey.

60
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,144
I won another one.

61
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:17,079
Lord, child,
you are unstoppable.

62
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,748
And had I known what you were up
to, I would have bought a ticket.

63
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,789
Earl.

64
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,484
I mean, dang it, girl,
what has gotten into you?

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,484
Just defective, I guess.

66
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,094
Nice parenting, Earl

67
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,495
Come on, now

68
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,164
I'll see you later

69
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:37,765
Dinner.

70
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:48,505
Seriously, out of all the
places to go to in the world,

71
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,016
who would come to Bodeen?

72
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:51,950
Them
I mean, they're smart,

73
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,612
at least they just
pass through.

74
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,121
Go ahead
and mock it.

75
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,455
But without the Blue Bonnet
factory, this town wouldn't exist.

76
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,757
You know what, Birdman,

77
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,321
I think I preferred you
before you got promoted.

78
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,158
You know, now
you're all corporate.

79
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,864
I know. I miss the old Birdman. Yeah.

80
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:14,874
Ladies, don't let the tie
fool you. I'm still one of us.

81
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:18,778
But y'all are gonna have to
start calling me Dwayne now.

82
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,712
It's more dignified.
No.

83
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,113
Birdman is the only thing
you have going for you.

84
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,313
That's what you think.

85
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,358
Really?

86
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,551
Yeah.

87
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:36,386
Hey

88
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,895
Make sure they
tip you this time.

89
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,877
Hey, what can I
get you guys?

90
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,510
Hey, Corbi

91
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:59,816
So what are you, like,
alternative now?

92
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,685
Alternative to what?

93
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:06,022
What's the name of that thing that
if I eat it real fast, it's free?

94
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:09,427
That's the Squealer. You have to
eat it in three minutes or less.

95
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,196
Yeah, you bring me
a Squealer.

96
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,537
And I don't mean Corbi.

97
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:23,877
Let's go, buddy, pick
it up Come on, come on.

98
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,412
Yes, you got it, you got it.

99
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:28,346
I can't believe you
used to share a bed with her.

100
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:33,383
You make it sound very dirty.
It was just sleepovers.

101
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:35,446
Come on! Come on!
Baby, do it. Do it.

102
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,022
Come on, Colby! Yeah!

103
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,528
That's my man.
Come on, Colby.

104
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,391
It's free, bitches!
It's free! It's free!

105
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:01,643
I was thinking

106
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,618
maybe we could go to
Austin and do some shopping.

107
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,078
Really?

108
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:12,387
Teach them well and
let them lead the way

109
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:17,620
Show them all the beauty
they possess inside

110
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:23,829
...them a sense of pride
to make It easier

111
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:29,140
You hate them.

112
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:33,509
Well, they don't have duct tape
on them That's an improvement.

113
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,142
Hi

114
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,013
Thanks.

115
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,957
Pretty vases.

116
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,954
They're great
for tulips, really.

117
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,139
Thank you. Yup,
I changed my mind.

118
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,835
- No, please, Bliss.
- Come on.

119
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:08,375
Don't...
Don't be embarrassed.

120
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:09,471
It's funny.

121
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,883
I'm supposed to buy you
shoes from a head shop?

122
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,011
Does that really strike you
as responsible parenting?

123
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:19,559
Fine 'cause shoes
are a gateway drug.

124
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:20,887
For gosh sakes, Bliss.

125
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:24,728
It goes out
of bounds near the 42 yard line.

126
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,561
There is a flag down.

127
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,862
- Yeah, it's Earl.
- Hello, Earl

128
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,664
Can you please explain
to your daughter

129
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:34,139
why it's inappropriate to
buy shoes in a head shop?

130
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,169
Dad, it's not like that

131
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,370
You took your
mother to a head shop?

132
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,503
Are you off your nut?

133
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,980
You know, if she wasn't
here and I used my own money,

134
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,346
it wouldn't make a difference
That's not the point.

135
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:47,819
Look, I am in the middle
of a deal here, okay?

136
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:51,085
So whatever you all
work out is fine with me.

137
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,215
- Give me that
- Okay?

138
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,886
Earl, do you know
how hard I have worked

139
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,929
to raise these girls in
a drug-free environment?

140
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:58,498
- Yes, I do.
- Exactly.

141
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,841
Hi.
Hey, girls. What's up?

142
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,176
Hello.
Dropping my flyers off.

143
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,881
- Perfect.
- Hurl Scouts-Holy Rollers.

144
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:27,026
- See you then
- Thanks, girls. Bye.

145
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,474
Come on All right,
let's go. Come on.

146
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:11,297
Screw you and your
grandma's Chevy Celebrity.

147
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:17,768
Here.

148
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,905
No, what are you doing?
Yes, yes, yes you got stiffed

149
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,175
on your tips again, just take it. No.

150
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,341
- Just take it, take it.
- No.

151
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:31,685
What is this?

152
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,359
Roller derby?

153
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,623
This is...
This is tomorrow.

154
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,790
This is in Austin.

155
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,358
Yeah, I know.

156
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,871
Will there be
cute boys there?

157
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,770
Hey, Mom, Dad. Ee're gonna
go to a football game.

158
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:56,975
It's an away game, but...

159
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,381
The team
kind of needs us.

160
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,817
No, not "kind of," they do.

161
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,014
Well, sure

162
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,520
Hey, I'll tell you what,
I'll take you.

163
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:09,654
No, it's cool.
You have your car.

164
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,788
Yeah, I have my car.

165
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:15,027
No, but I mean, you know,
we can watch together.

166
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,194
Earl, let the girls go on
and have their fun.

167
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,499
And then you and I
can nuzzle.

168
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,052
I kind of feel bad
lying to them.

169
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,679
I don't. I give my
parents straight A's.

170
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,247
I get freedom.

171
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,134
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

172
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:57,732
Okay, everybody, and welcome
to skate night at the Warehouse.

173
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,171
I'm a little hung-over
tonight, so I...

174
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,935
Anyway, let me introduce you
to our first team.

175
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,739
Coming to you from
the streets of Austin,

176
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:11,680
men, hold on to your
cookies, it's the Hurl Scouts.

177
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,909
Number 99, captain of the
Hurl Scouts, Maggie Mayhem.

178
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:19,753
Number 69, Bloody Holly.

179
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:22,691
Number 3, Rosa Sparks

180
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:26,696
Number 2, Smashley Simpson

181
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,995
Razor Magee's Hurl Scouts have come
in last place three years running.

182
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:33,864
This league has five teams,
each with their own theme.

183
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,839
What outlaw do we have
skating against the Hurl Scouts

184
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,000
this fine Texas
evening here?

185
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,778
I'm talking about the girls so bad
that even God can't keep them in line.

186
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:49,684
Give it up for the
undefeated Holy Rollers.

187
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:52,286
Last season's champs
are led by their captain,

188
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:56,225
the league's leading
scorer, Iron Maven.

189
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,156
Yeah, she's the one
from the flyer.

190
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:01,528
I'm feeling hot in these
polyesters right now, baby.

191
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,295
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:08,704
let's play some
roller derby!

193
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:12,408
A jammer scores
a point in this course

194
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,001
by passing members
of the opposite team.

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,173
Maven gets a great jump.
That's fast.

196
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,840
And she's out
to an early lead.

197
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,509
Iron Maven,
ladies and gentlemen.

198
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,981
Folks, the ones to watch
tonight are the jammers.

199
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:26,353
Those are the ones with
the stars on their helmets.

200
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:30,724
Some of you might remember watching
derby on TV back in the '70s,

201
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,026
but it was reborn right here
in the heart of Texas,

202
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,363
a true Austin tradition.

203
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,198
Maven's heading up on the outside
but It's real crowded in there.

204
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,532
That's a big
hit by Rosa Sparks.

205
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,335
Jackie Daniels is down.

206
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,899
Lucky for the Hurl Scouts
this is only an exhibition bout

207
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,103
because the Rollers
are in control.

208
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,280
Thank you, Maggie.

209
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,094
I just wanna tell you all
that you're my new heroes.

210
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,794
It's your
first time here?

211
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,361
Yeah.

212
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,263
Well, put some skates on,
be your own hero.

213
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:14,570
The last time I wore skates,
they had Barbies on them.

214
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,233
Hey, you know, none of us knew our
ass from an elbow pad when we started.

215
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,739
You should come to
tryouts on Tuesday.

216
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,245
You have to be 21.
You're 21, right?

217
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,310
Two... I'm 22.

218
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,985
Yeah, I just had my...
I had my birthday, so...

219
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,247
Great, it's this
Tuesday at 5:00.

220
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,551
It is?
Yeah.

221
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,485
I'm Maggie,
Maggie Mayhem.

222
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,552
I'm Bliss,
but I can change that.

223
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,165
Yeah, you'll have
to change that.

224
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,325
Don't be late.

225
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,172
"Twenty-two.
Just had my birthday."

226
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,601
Twenty-one,
it's a red flag.

227
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:52,437
Twenty-two is way
more believable.

228
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,003
I guess, 'cause you're not actually
gonna do it, so I guess it makes sense.

229
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,071
Why don't
you and I try out?

230
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,616
Excuse me?

231
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,811
I didn't have a
Barbie-roller-skating phase. Okay?

232
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,081
I had a fat-kid-sits-inside-
and-reads-a-book phase.

233
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:06,315
You know that.

234
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,791
Well, what makes you
think I won't try out?

235
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:14,452
Because you'd
be scared to go without me.

236
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:17,967
And those roller derby
girls, they're tough.

237
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,935
And you are not.

238
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:22,096
How dare you?

239
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,532
Not to mention
your mom.

240
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,132
She doesn't
have to know.

241
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,210
You don't have
the balls.

242
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,148
I can grow the balls.

243
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,892
No way.

244
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,506
Hey!

245
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,174
Do you have room
for one more?

246
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,891
I like your hair.

247
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,794
Thanks, hon.
I do it myself.

248
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,433
All right, next
stop, downtown Austin.

249
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

250
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:56,917
What's your derby name?

251
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,119
Pocket Rocket.

252
00:18:58,194 --> 00:18:59,252
What's yours?

253
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,420
Jaba the Slut.

254
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:04,333
- Hey, you made it.
- Oh, yeah.

255
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:06,162
Yeah, I'm glad
you came.

256
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:07,428
Thanks.

257
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,644
What is that?

258
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:19,203
That would be Razor.
He's our coach.

259
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:22,549
He's a good guy. And he
really knows his derby.

260
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,310
All right, ladies.
Let's roll.

261
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:26,712
Ooh, jeans shorts

262
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:28,221
Every single day.

263
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:32,722
Meet the
Manson sisters.

264
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:36,161
Gift from the Ottawa Women's
Hockey League to the Hurl Scouts.

265
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,496
They both seem
really aggressive.

266
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,662
Maybe we can finally
win a few this year.

267
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:42,897
Maybe.

268
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,475
All right, listen up,
fresh meat.

269
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,739
There's a lot more to derby than
fishnets and picking out a tough name.

270
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,244
This is a sport.

271
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,008
Now, the league
has six spots open.

272
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,050
So whatever shred
of talent you have,

273
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,915
hope you leave it out
on the track for me today.

274
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:00,688
Okay, what is it?

275
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:01,848
Sorry

276
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,087
Just what are the rules?

277
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,428
Derby 101, people.

278
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,761
Four blockers from each team
are lined up on the track.

279
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,162
Ten feet behind them,

280
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,167
two jammers are lined up,
one from each team.

281
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:15,532
We're the ones who score.

282
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,572
First whistle blows
and the pack takes off.

283
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:21,073
Then a second whistle blows
and the jammers take off.

284
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:24,043
Some of us faster than others.

285
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,770
Once the jammer
breaks through the pack,

286
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:30,339
she hauls ass around the track
a second time and tries to score.

287
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,251
For every player on the
opposing team the jammer passes,

288
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,685
she gets a point.

289
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:37,452
Most points wins the game
every single time.

290
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,049
Now, line up
and get you some.

291
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:44,558
Get up.

292
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,104
Go, ladies!
Move it!

293
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:54,231
Up, up, up, go!

294
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,741
Looking good, Barbie.

295
00:20:57,912 --> 00:20:59,880
It's roller derby,
not cotillion.

296
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,882
Come on,
put a hit on somebody.

297
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,949
God damn it, Diane!

298
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:15,328
Hey. That move will get
you tossed from a game.

299
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,126
There's no place in
this sport for that.

300
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:20,960
What?

301
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,662
Okay, sorry.

302
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:28,641
But I like the aggression.

303
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,676
Is it bad?

304
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,682
No.

305
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:41,649
Forty-one, gotta improve
on that. 39. 32, not bad.

306
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,017
Twenty-nine. Let's go.

307
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:49,686
Twenty-three?

308
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:57,766
Looks like you've
got some competition.

309
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,297
Yeah, yeah, wake me when she
learns how to throw a hit.

310
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:08,547
Or take one.

311
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,568
Hey, you're
Iron Maven.

312
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:33,539
That's right,
kiss-ass.

313
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,703
Why don't you suck up
a little harder?

314
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,712
There's still part of your face
that doesn't have doodie on it.

315
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,978
- Nice shorts.
- Help.

316
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,410
Can somebody help me?
I...

317
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,927
Just kidding.

318
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:02,225
Hey, by the way, you made
it, you're a Hurl Scout.

319
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,599
Nice work out there.

320
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,251
Your feet are on fire.
They're on fire.

321
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,792
Seriously, look,
they're on fire.

322
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,291
You're changing
your schedule?

323
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:30,590
Well, I have to.
You know, for practice.

324
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,858
Don't leave me alone
with Birdman.

325
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,867
You can change
yours to mine.

326
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,768
I can't. I'm actually taking
an SAT class, remember?

327
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:12,129
Shania, I am not cleaning Salisbury
steak sauce off of that fringe again.

328
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,069
Hey, I just wanted
to let you guys know

329
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:16,803
that I'm gonna change
my work schedule

330
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,241
to Mondays, Wednesdays,

331
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:21,611
'cause I wanna take an SAT
class on Tuesdays, Thursdays.

332
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,111
I'm impressed.

333
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:25,446
Me, too.

334
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:29,652
I like smart girls, that's
why I married your mama.

335
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,156
Well, that and I
knocked her up.

336
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:24,339
Shouldn't... Shouldn't we,
like, be practicing soon?

337
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:26,379
Yeah, hurry up, you guys,
we don't wanna be late.

338
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:31,175
Careful, Pee-Wee here might
get the idea we actually win.

339
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,518
You don't?
Hell, no never.

340
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:36,521
All that "We're Number 1"
corporate crap doesn't apply.

341
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,023
Our bad attitude's
an asset here.

342
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:42,220
Okay, ladies.
Check it out.

343
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:46,355
Hot off the presses, brand new
playbooks compiled by yours truly.

344
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:48,722
Your hands clean?

345
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,563
Yes, my hands
are clean.

346
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,899
Pay particular attention
to Play Number 3.

347
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,996
I think it's gonna
blow your doors off.

348
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:56,871
Smashley,
you're late as per usual.

349
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,500
I know.

350
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:02,536
Well, then you must also know that
there's nothing cool about being late.

351
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:04,082
Hey...
Let's hit the track.

352
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:08,415
Who's up for Lovejoy's later
tonight? $2 pitchers. Beer?

353
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:09,745
I'm in.

354
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:10,879
Me, too.

355
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,184
I'm in.

356
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,287
You weren't invited.

357
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:18,619
I'm still in.

358
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,198
There's no such thing
as a scrimmage.

359
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,894
We practice
the way we play.

360
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,401
Maven, you know
what to do.

361
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,734
Bliss, show me
something good.

362
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,040
You ready?
Am I ready?

363
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,149
Let's go,
ladies. Skate.

364
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:41,749
Don't block your own player,
let's go.

365
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:44,119
Crossover the turn, stay
low. Crossover the turn.

366
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,590
Bend those knees. Bend
those knees. Bend those knees.

367
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:59,434
What the hell
was that?

368
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:00,995
You had Maven beat,
but she smoked you

369
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,506
'cause you're too
scared to throw a hit.

370
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,131
And then you quit.

371
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,676
I need you to
be a lot more...

372
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:08,770
- I want you to start being a lot...
- Ruthless.

373
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:10,808
Yeah.

374
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:15,453
That's right, you little peanut,
I need you to be ruthless.

375
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,512
This is
a contact sport, Bliss.

376
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:20,456
Eventually I'm gonna
need you to make contact.

377
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,795
- Next group up.
- Back off, Razor

378
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:25,125
- Just ignore him
- We do.

379
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:26,528
Seriously.

380
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:34,534
I mean, he's right.
I'm not cutting it.

381
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:38,540
You know what I like to
think about before every game?

382
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,168
My ex.

383
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,507
Little piece
of advice, Bliss.

384
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,047
Don't fall for your
regional manager

385
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,276
and think that he's not
gonna give you crabs

386
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:48,718
because he cheated on you,
'cause it happens.

387
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:54,216
And when I think about myself in the
shower, using that special shampoo,

388
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:58,953
which, for the record, doesn't make
anyone feel very special at all.

389
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,556
I really, really
wanna hit somebody.

390
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:06,026
You have to find that thing that
really pisses you off and you use it.

391
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,869
Have you ever had crabs?

392
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:13,633
No.

393
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:17,245
No, okay, my doctor said
it was really common, but...

394
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:26,517
B- man, come on.
What do you say?

395
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:30,254
Pash has to come. You
know, it's my first game.

396
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:32,487
Yeah, well,
what about me?

397
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,532
I mean, did anybody
bother to think.

398
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,194
"Hey, Birdman might appreciate hot
girls in fishnets and roller skates

399
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:40,897
"beating the crap
out of each other"?

400
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,033
No, they did not.

401
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:46,040
Do you wanna come, too?

402
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:50,845
Yeah, but I can't.
I have a prior engagement.

403
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:54,208
I'm covering for Pash.

404
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,385
- Yes, we love you.
- Birdman.

405
00:28:58,456 --> 00:28:59,718
- Yeah?
- You know we love you.

406
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,520
- Thank you. We do.
- You know that, right?

407
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:03,856
Yeah, yeah.
Not enough.

408
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:05,190
We're crazy about you.

409
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:14,131
You can never have
too much eyeliner.

410
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:18,598
Or Lash Blast.

411
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,735
Here's a little gift
from the team.

412
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,371
Safety is sexy

413
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:28,748
You'll need these, too.
Those are just sexy.

414
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,481
Guys, thanks.

415
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,482
Let the bout come to you.
Let the bout come to you.

416
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:40,123
So, are you ready
for your big debut?

417
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,892
Has anyone ever thrown up
on the track before?

418
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:47,663
Yeah.

419
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:50,764
- Let's get them.
- Kill them dead.

420
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:52,840
Skate fast, skate hard.

421
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm gonna puke.

422
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:56,272
During the day,
they go by Peggy, Francine,

423
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:57,814
Tammy, and Rachael,
but here...

424
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,849
All right, let
the bout come to you.

425
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,077
Okay.

426
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,512
One, two,
three, kick ass!

427
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:06,783
And they're off!

428
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:09,952
Jamming for the Widows, Eva
Destruction against the Hurl Scouts.

429
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:12,588
Bloody Holly who makes
her way out to the pack.

430
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:16,361
And, oh, she passes the block
with a beautiful backward skating.

431
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,298
But wait a second,
from out of nowhere,

432
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,099
Eva Destruction shows up
right on her tail.

433
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:24,005
Each girl the jammer passes,
they get a point.

434
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:26,099
Pass a girl,
get a point.

435
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:30,039
And she's gotten the first
seven points of the game.

436
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:34,211
And the Widows
take the lead.

437
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:37,650
Hey, Black Widows, my
spidey senses are tingling.

438
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,213
About to make a sequel
in my pants.

439
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,485
Yeah,
Spider-Man 3 and a Half?

440
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:46,159
Yeah, it is three and
a half inches wide.

441
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:49,028
Air trombone, yeah.

442
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,391
Nice jam, man.

443
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,196
That was amazing.

444
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:55,362
Thanks.

445
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,229
Yeah. Thank you.

446
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,866
Where did you learn
to skate like that?

447
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:01,466
Well, I once tried out
for the Olympics,

448
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:03,740
but that didn't
exactly work out.

449
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,008
You gotta maintain the
triangle configuration.

450
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,984
I've been over it and
over it with you guys.

451
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,246
What do you want
to do? Come on.

452
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:14,222
I don't need to do the triangle
I need to get up there and...

453
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,857
It's the second quarter
and we have Manson Number 1

454
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:20,521
jamming for
the Hurl Scouts.

455
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:22,929
This is a rough
contact sport.

456
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,227
These girls are lean,
mean skating machines.

457
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,701
And they gotta go fast if they
wanna get past the blockers

458
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,363
who are trying
to knock them down.

459
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:32,738
And by "knock them down,"
I mean "beat them to a pulp."

460
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:34,835
Eva's gonna grab
another four points,

461
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:38,540
bringing the Widows' score to
26 over the Hurl Scouts' 10.

462
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:43,109
Team captain Maggie Mayhem doing the
honors for the Hurl Scouts, but...

463
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,053
Getting Widows jammer Honey
Suck it back for that rail check

464
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:48,717
and Whiskey sweeps Manson
Number 2 out of the way,

465
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,783
making room for Honey
to widen the gap

466
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:56,457
to collect another three points
there as we go into halftime.

467
00:31:56,933 --> 00:32:00,061
That makes the score 29-10.

468
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,562
They say the Scouts have
the most loyal fans,

469
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,905
and being the worst team in the
league, Lord knows they need them.

470
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:09,275
Oh, Rosa Sparks,
no, you didn’t.

471
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:12,145
God damn it.

472
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:15,974
Okay, folks, the Widows
have a pretty comfortable lead here

473
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:17,246
late in the game.

474
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,810
Hurl Scouts coach Razor

475
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:21,720
still sticking with Smashley
Simpson as the jammer.

476
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,386
She's up against the Widows'
speed woman, Honey Suckit.

477
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:28,295
The Widows' jammer
hip-checks Smashley.

478
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:32,094
Well, our favorite
Whole Foods checkout girl

479
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:34,501
is about to bag her some Honey.

480
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:37,636
Clean-up on Aisle 5.

481
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:40,505
With time left for only one
more jam, and the game out of reach,

482
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:43,977
Smashley Simpson
is out of here.

483
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,615
Okay, you're in.

484
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:50,008
Show me why they
call you Ruthless.

485
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,426
Go get you some.

486
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:13,272
Okay, Austin, get ready to
meet your newest Hurl Scout.

487
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:18,781
Here she is, Number 22, the fastest
thing on eight wheels, Babe Ruthless.

488
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:23,212
Babe Ruthless? All
right. Go, Babe Ruthless!

489
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:26,344
All right,
it's the final jam of the night.

490
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,787
I like the taste
of fresh meat.

491
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,450
And Razor, with nothing
to lose, throws the rookie

492
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,497
into the last jam on
her very first game.

493
00:33:35,564 --> 00:33:36,656
And dang.

494
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:40,828
Babe Ruthless gets a double shove
to the rail served up by Whiskey.

495
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,303
But she's back up
like a Weeble.

496
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:44,737
Okay, okay, that's good.

497
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,073
She darts down the inside
and heads towards the outside

498
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:54,012
and makes a run for it
out of the pack.

499
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:57,246
Oh, but here comes Eva
Destruction, still skating strong,

500
00:33:57,353 --> 00:33:59,583
hoping to ruin
Babe's debut.

501
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:03,590
Ruthless is out of the pack. She's
coming around for her points.

502
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:08,389
That's my best friend.
That's my best friend.

503
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:11,557
Rumor has it that Ruthless blew
away the judges in speed trials,

504
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,897
and you could certainly see why tonight.

505
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:16,198
And now Manson Number 1
takes out Eva.

506
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:18,206
Feeling the heat
Ruthless is bringing,

507
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,105
and she gets through
for the score.

508
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,605
And Ruthless
gets four points.

509
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,540
Go, Babe Ruthless!

510
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:27,548
Babe Ruthless scored the
last four points of the game,

511
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:30,517
but the Widows
take this one home.

512
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:32,076
Congratulations,
you still suck.

513
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:37,520
That's great. Celebrate
mediocrity, that's fantastic.

514
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:39,083
Yeah, it's all a big joke.

515
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:40,218
We came second.

516
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:42,526
We came second.
You came second.

517
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:45,465
We came in second
out of two teams. Nice.

518
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:48,797
We're
number 2, we're number 2.

519
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:51,566
We're number 2.
We're number 2.

520
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,733
Razor, come on you did good.

521
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,106
Well, I didn't
throw up.

522
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,404
That'll do.
Good thing.

523
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,907
Oh, my God I take back what I
said about you not being tough.

524
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,781
- You kicked ass.
- Really?

525
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,944
- And I saw that guy you liked.
- You did?

526
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:07,386
But then I lost him.

527
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:09,651
- Bliss.
- Hey, Hot Tubs.

528
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,919
Oh, I can't. I gotta
get home to my man.

529
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:15,088
- No.
- Yes. Great game.

530
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:16,657
Yeah, man,
that was good.

531
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:18,130
What's Hot Tubs?

532
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:22,499
Well, here at the
Warehouse, he's Johnny Rocket.

533
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,931
But here he's
"Hot Tub" Johnny.

534
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:28,238
Even though he's not allowed in,
we started calling him "Hot Tub"

535
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,073
until he got us one.

536
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:34,475
All right.
Check it out.

537
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,312
No, that's the thing.

538
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:41,586
- Coke?
- You swallowed?

539
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:43,522
That's hilarious.

540
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:46,018
Not in this lifetime, Johnny.

541
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,755
Or the next one.

542
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:50,990
Hey!

543
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,267
What's up, ladies?

544
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,332
Should we help him?

545
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:06,504
Nah, that's her fiancé.
He loves it.

546
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:08,980
- That's my fiancé
- Hey.

547
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,515
You know, there's some stuff
I'm pretty sure I could teach you.

548
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,520
Johnny.

549
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:20,620
Y'all check it out.
He's not even in anymore, man.

550
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,828
Hey, man, check this out.

551
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,028
That's not a bruise.
That's a bruise.

552
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,431
Yeah, you look pretty good
That's nice, huh?

553
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:13,778
Pash?

554
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,277
Nice choice.

555
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:48,473
Yeah?

556
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,307
Yeah, and I love
this one.

557
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,785
So where you from?

558
00:37:55,423 --> 00:38:00,292
Well, I hail from the bustling
metropolis known as Bodeen, Texas.

559
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,794
The tiny town, right?
Off of South 84?

560
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,092
That would be the one.

561
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,066
You live alone?

562
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:08,432
Roommate.

563
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,494
Me, too.
Four of them.

564
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,632
Why Bodeen? If you don't mind
me asking what do you do there?

565
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:19,238
By day, I work
at the Oink Joint.

566
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:22,064
But by night...

567
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:24,065
Oliver! Oliver!

568
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:25,614
Oliver!

569
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:27,085
One second.

570
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,350
Oliver!

571
00:38:34,494 --> 00:38:36,860
Get your ass down here you left
Jasper's guitar in your car.

572
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:37,952
All right, dill weed.

573
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:39,089
Shut up, douche bag.

574
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,497
- Nimrod.
- Tampon.

575
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,658
Tool.

576
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:49,802
What are you doing in approximately
five and a half minutes?

577
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,144
No official plans.

578
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:53,372
Great.

579
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:56,875
I'll go bring
you something.

580
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,788
There she is.
All by herself.

581
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,230
- Hey.
- Don't fight it.

582
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,671
Let's get a beer.

583
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,175
Oh, my God.

584
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:32,882
Okay, you can make out
with him, but that is it.

585
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:35,516
Who are you,
my mother?

586
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:36,749
Pash?

587
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:44,426
Savage and I have been
looking everywhere for you.

588
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,023
Yeah, I bet.

589
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,361
My belly hurts.

590
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:49,527
There's a storm
in there.

591
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:53,701
It really does, though.

592
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,901
Come on, hold on.
Hold on. Let's get this.

593
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:00,211
It's cool.
I swallowed it.

594
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,680
No, come on. Just stick
your fingers in your throat.

595
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:04,717
No, you stick your finger
down your throat.

596
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:09,744
Pash. Have you ever thought
about your parents making love?

597
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,419
Your dad's naked body?

598
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:13,549
What?

599
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:15,720
His balls jiggling.

600
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:18,524
- Sweaty.
- No.

601
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:24,929
That's not fair.

602
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,130
Could you get me
a washcloth?

603
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,365
Yeah.

604
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,802
I'm sorry I ruined
your kind of date.

605
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:35,910
But I want dirt.

606
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:42,419
His name's Oliver.
It's a great name.

607
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:48,658
Yeah, if you like wayfaring
Dickensian orphans.

608
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:57,770
You're gonna have to roll over
you smell like a dead goat.

609
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,936
Sorry

610
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,424
Hey, girl.
How was the sleepover?

611
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:22,790
Fine.

612
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:38,466
Bliss, are you ready yet?

613
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,603
The Blue Bonnet brunch
is in an hour.

614
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:44,439
Did you forget?

615
00:41:46,185 --> 00:41:49,382
You think you have all
the time in the world,

616
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:54,454
but there's not many girls who
are both smart and pretty like you.

617
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:57,495
And I hate to admit it, but the
pretty part doesn't last forever.

618
00:41:57,563 --> 00:42:00,964
You got to make the most of
what you have while you can.

619
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,694
Nobody tells you that.

620
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,826
Mom, you're still
really beautiful.

621
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,999
Save your sarcasm for later.

622
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,042
How's your inspiration
speech coming?

623
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:14,075
- I'm working on it.
- You want me to read it?

624
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:15,976
- Not yet.
- Later?

625
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:31,560
Bodeen, Bodeen,
Bodeen, Bodeen.

626
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:35,398
Someone get me
out of here, Bodeen.

627
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:38,527
It's depressing
in the sticks.

628
00:42:38,604 --> 00:42:40,697
I'm all over
these racist hicks.

629
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,436
And I'm jonesing
for an Austin fix.

630
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,340
Yeah. That's right.

631
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:58,453
Oh, my God,
it's him.

632
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:01,726
What do I do?

633
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,694
Go ask him if he
wants a Squealer.

634
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,734
Are you stalking me?

635
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:20,972
No, ma'am.

636
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:25,743
I happen to be here in Bodeen on
business craving some barbeque.

637
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:29,216
And, yeah,
I'm stalking you.

638
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,624
Okay.

639
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:38,087
Can you take a break?

640
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:47,300
You owe me. I wasn't even
supposed to work today.

641
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:51,407
I love you.

642
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:03,185
Is this you?

643
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:11,752
Technically, it's my brother's
band. But, yes, I'm in it.

644
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,423
And I'll be taking
that from you now.

645
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:21,365
Wow. From here it kind of looks like
you're wearing a Stryper T-shirt.

646
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:25,306
Stryper? Yeah, '80s
Christian heavy metal.

647
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,311
I mean, "In the name
of Jesus, we rock."

648
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:33,373
Well, I suppose if
it's in His name then.

649
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,715
What's this? What's this three
million five hundred and...

650
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:39,380
Oh, that's nothing.

651
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,656
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know.

652
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:45,696
It's a little thing
called a high score.

653
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:50,567
At just the right...
Go. Nice shot.

654
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:54,362
Is this what you do
with all the girls?

655
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:56,837
You take them here to
show off your skills?

656
00:44:56,908 --> 00:45:01,140
Yeah. And it
usually works, too.

657
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:03,009
Oh, yeah?

658
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,715
Maybe we should do
something different.

659
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:26,231
I should probably
get to practice.

660
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:34,377
Shit.

661
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:40,913
I think I might
have lost my keys.

662
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:44,281
- Marco.
- Polo.

663
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,621
Marco.

664
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:48,851
Polo.

665
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,727
Marco!

666
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:54,560
Polo!

667
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,028
Found them.

668
00:45:57,101 --> 00:45:58,693
Cool, I guess
we can go now.

669
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:05,067
Oops.

670
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:07,201
I'm gonna kill you.

671
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,143
I'm gonna tear you up.
I know.

672
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:10,544
I am going to...

673
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:12,947
I realize this.
I realize this.

674
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:18,052
Holy crap, you guys.
We almost won that one.

675
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:19,384
Yeah, almost.

676
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:22,426
You know, Razor's play
actually worked.

677
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:25,222
Man, maybe we ought
to learn new plays.

678
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:27,286
What's up,
Hurl Scouts?

679
00:46:27,397 --> 00:46:28,830
That was so
good out there.

680
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:31,492
It was really cute to see
y'all trying so hard.

681
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,567
I hate her.

682
00:46:35,672 --> 00:46:37,640
- Bliss.
- Yeah?

683
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:41,575
Remember all that stuff I said
about winning not mattering?

684
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:43,237
Forget it.

685
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:45,508
I wanna beat
that cocky bitch.

686
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,409
Me, too.

687
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,989
On my team. Yeah!

688
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,856
Look what Corbi did.

689
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:07,697
With all that
combined brain power,

690
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:09,499
this is the best
they could come up with?

691
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:11,301
They got
your freckles.

692
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,602
That they did.

693
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,181
Hey, are you all right?

694
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:31,790
You can't do that.

695
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:33,658
She just did.

696
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,129
We deserve
better villains.

697
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,127
Just a few minutes gone by,

698
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,828
but the game is already
falling into a familiar pattern,

699
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:43,134
giving the Fight Attendants
an 18-to-6 lead.

700
00:47:43,206 --> 00:47:46,801
Okay, ladies, we're getting
beat, but we got the playbooks.

701
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:50,573
Time to show these Fight
Attendants a few tricks of our own.

702
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:54,813
Let's run Play Number 3.
Stampede.

703
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:56,842
Number 3?

704
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,979
Yeah. I think we only
got to Number 2.

705
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:01,487
Like, one and a half

706
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:05,693
You didn't learn
a goddamn thing, did you?

707
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:08,697
What's it gonna take for
you guys to pull it together?

708
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:12,326
You know what?
That's it. Hold this.

709
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:16,167
Did he just
take Number 3?

710
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,432
Come on. That's all I'm
saying, just skate on through.

711
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:23,869
Hey, what's up, Razor?
Ready to forfeit?

712
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:27,280
Forfeit my ass.
Run this play.

713
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:30,718
What do I look like?
An idiot?

714
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:33,221
Anyway, I've got
my own plays.

715
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,715
Here's $20. You know
how little money I have.

716
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:38,624
You run the play. You don't
score at least three points,

717
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:40,753
you got another 20 coming
at the end of the bout.

718
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,557
Just run the play, Jeff.

719
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,190
- You all right? Let's skate.
- Yeah.

720
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:47,701
- Ladies, we've got a change of plan
- What?

721
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:52,803
Hey, don't let that traitor throw
you. Let's hit him where it hurts.

722
00:48:53,443 --> 00:48:56,378
Did Razor just coach the other
team or did my peyote just kick in?

723
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,945
I don't even know
what's coming on

724
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,947
'cause I don't know what's
coming around the corner.

725
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:03,540
Fight Attendants are
about to take on the sky.

726
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,747
Whoa! Holy crap,
a 180 turn.

727
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:10,986
Kami Kaze makes her way through the
rubble to score an easy four points.

728
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:13,584
Fight Attendants, 22,
Hurl Scouts, 6.

729
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:15,789
Is that Play Number 3?

730
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:17,559
Works pretty well, doesn't it?

731
00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:19,765
You suck.

732
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:20,927
You turncoat.

733
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:23,836
Want me to give them
Play Number 4 now?

734
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:26,597
No.

735
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,768
Okay, take a knee.

736
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:33,279
Okay, I wanna put what
just happened behind us.

737
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:36,681
I know I've moved on. We're
gonna run Play Number 2.

738
00:49:36,785 --> 00:49:40,915
Fire and Smashley, you at least
know the first half of that, right?

739
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,782
Yes.

740
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:43,950
Okay.

741
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,655
Then get out there
and get you some.

742
00:49:46,762 --> 00:49:50,163
Hey, Scouts. You mind finishing
your little Family Feud huddle?

743
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:52,927
Survey says you're
wasting our time.

744
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:58,367
Let's go ape shit.

745
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,099
Yeah.

746
00:50:09,017 --> 00:50:12,180
Coming out of halftime
and an alternate universe,

747
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:16,053
Coach Razor puts former figure skater
Bloody Holly in the jammer position,

748
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:18,183
who launches furiously
into the pack.

749
00:50:18,293 --> 00:50:21,228
The team is on their game now,
pushing Bloody to the front.

750
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,821
And she makes it through
Bitch and Cooke Flake

751
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,800
grabbing a total of eight
points for the Hurl Scouts.

752
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:28,166
Come on, come on!

753
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:32,833
The Hurl Scouts are catching up
in points for the first time ever.

754
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,876
As this space
oddity continues,

755
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:39,004
Babe Ruthless uses
her speed to fly by...

756
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,073
Oh! Axels of Evil
knocks her down.

757
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:45,176
But she's back up. Here
they come around the turn.

758
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:46,846
A choreographed move
from the Hurl Scouts.

759
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,856
Has to be from
Razor's playbook.

760
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,892
That makes
the score 58-58,

761
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:52,984
a first in the history
of the Hurl Scouts.

762
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:56,656
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but the Hurl Scouts are tied.

763
00:50:56,732 --> 00:50:59,223
We got a tie game
here, folks.

764
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:01,359
Oh, but Smashley goes down.

765
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:03,267
- Really?
- Bitch. What the... No.

766
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:05,533
Ooh, watch out, Tammy.

767
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,575
Here comes Smashley

768
00:51:07,676 --> 00:51:09,041
Get off me,
you psycho.

769
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,908
We've got two girls
brawling on the track.

770
00:51:11,013 --> 00:51:13,880
I don't know whether to break it
up or break out the video camera.

771
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:16,884
Hell hath no fury
like a woman fouled.

772
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:18,078
That's not legal.

773
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:21,747
By day, these ladies are your
favorite waitresses, nurses, teachers.

774
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:26,123
But by night these girls give
the crowd what they came for.

775
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,094
Smashley Simpson is out of
here. We're only moments to go

776
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:32,564
and the Hurl Scouts have
managed to squeak out in front.

777
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:37,230
We're at a 70-67.
Hurl Scouts!

778
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:41,798
Okay, grab her wrists,
hold on tight. Go.

779
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:45,271
Play Number 8.
You ready for the whip?

780
00:51:45,379 --> 00:51:47,074
Put your arm out,
I'll be there.

781
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:48,581
It's the final
seconds of the game.

782
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:50,913
Manson ramps Cookie Rumble,
and the Hurl Scouts attempt

783
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:53,215
a classic move in derby.

784
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,221
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

785
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:57,484
Nothing gives you
speed like the whip.

786
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,098
A whip!

787
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,558
Ruthless is flying into the pack

788
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:03,756
while her teammates are doing
a downright professional job

789
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:07,961
of clearing the way. She picks
up one, two, three, four points.

790
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:11,596
Break out
the merit badges. 74-67.

791
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:14,738
The Hurl Scouts
have finally won one.

792
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,673
Fight Attendants, this
is your captain speaking.

793
00:52:17,778 --> 00:52:20,440
It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride back
to Loserville. So if you have your...

794
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:23,608
You win the game. If you
run the plays, you win the game!

795
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:26,118
How about them Hurl Scouts?
Yeah, how about them Hurl Scouts?

796
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,484
How about them Hurl Scouts?

797
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:29,681
Touché, ladies.
Touché.

798
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,021
We got to run the plays. We
run the plays, we win the game.

799
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,525
- We'll do our homework
- Every time.

800
00:52:34,762 --> 00:52:37,856
There're only 10 of them.
It's not... Not rocket science.

801
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:39,489
Let's get those
Holy Rollers!

802
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,828
Yes!

803
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:59,717
Murray. Murray.
Murray!

804
00:53:14,335 --> 00:53:19,204
Please tell me you did not
shove Corbi Booth over a rail.

805
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:21,471
Actually, I did.

806
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:24,705
Corbi has a huge
bruise on her leg.

807
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:27,645
I know that you're just
too bohemian to care,

808
00:53:27,715 --> 00:53:29,342
but she has to
cheer tonight.

809
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,017
And she's gonna go through
with it? What an athlete.

810
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:35,317
I'd like to
speak to the parents alone.

811
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:43,921
She's passing one, two,
three girls. That's three points.

812
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:46,063
If you're still having trouble
following the game, folks,

813
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,758
don't worry,
you're not the only one.

814
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:49,429
We'll keep
track of the score for you.

815
00:53:49,537 --> 00:53:51,437
You keep track
of the fishnets.

816
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:54,531
This is a whole new Hurl Scouts on this
four-game winning streak they're on.

817
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,771
They ain't playing scared,
that's for sure.

818
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,275
Number 22 pulls it off again,
earning another merit badge.

819
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:05,113
Looks like she's on her way
to rookie of the year,

820
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,382
and I can't think of anyone in
recent history more deserving.

821
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,083
Oh!
They gave her the whip

822
00:54:10,191 --> 00:54:12,056
You wanted it and they
gave it to you, folks.

823
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:13,218
You've been whipped.

824
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:17,027
Nothing gives you
speed like the whip.

825
00:54:17,564 --> 00:54:19,225
And the Scouts,
they go for another one,

826
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,757
inching even closer to
a slot in the championship.

827
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:49,726
So my brother's been
working on some dates.

828
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,390
And it looks like this tour
thing is actually gonna happen.

829
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,495
That's really great.

830
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:57,968
Yeah, I guess.

831
00:54:58,404 --> 00:55:02,431
Thirty-four days crammed into a
crappy van with four other dudes.

832
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:05,839
Like a bathroom on
wheels or something.

833
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:07,408
That's a long time.

834
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:11,678
No, it's cool.

835
00:55:13,653 --> 00:55:17,180
Look, you'll be doing your
thing, I'll be doing mine.

836
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:21,857
It'll go by fast,
you'll see.

837
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:41,539
- Hit it.
- Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.

838
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:44,511
Go, go, go, baby
Yeah. I love it.

839
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:46,050
- Oh, my God
- Do it.

840
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,682
No, I don't wanna
know, I don't wanna know.

841
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:52,188
Blisster?
What are you doing?

842
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,725
I'm watching the game.

843
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:01,164
That's what I tell the folks
at work, I'm cutting out early.

844
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:03,964
I tell your mom
I'm coming home late.

845
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,736
Dad, I'm not
gonna tell her.

846
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:14,672
Why do you feel like
you have to lie to her?

847
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,713
You gotta pick your
battles with your mother

848
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:24,984
because she is a fighter.

849
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:31,691
This Blue Bonnet deal
means so much to her.

850
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:36,531
And I think it's really
nice, you going along.

851
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,704
But you know there's more
to life than beauty pageants.

852
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,571
You know that, right?

853
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:44,700
I'm aware.

854
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,870
All right.
I'll shut up.

855
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:50,842
Can I have one?

856
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:55,951
No, you may not, but you
can have a sip of mine.

857
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,459
Oh!
He took it to him.

858
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,962
That was a nice...
That was a good block.

859
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,864
Since when do you
like football?

860
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:15,096
I don't.
I better go.

861
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:26,544
Hey, listen up. Just
a brief announcement,

862
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:28,449
then you get right
back to your food.

863
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:30,487
The championship bout
is November 12th.

864
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:33,884
You got your flyers
right there.

865
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:36,985
If the Hurl Scouts win
one more game, we're in it.

866
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:38,460
Good luck with that.

867
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:40,656
Now I'd like to yield the
floor to Miss Eva Destruction.

868
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,434
Love you, Eva.

869
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,834
Thank you.

870
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:48,339
In the grand
derby tradition,

871
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,241
as you know, the new poster girl is
revealed by a member of another team.

872
00:57:53,946 --> 00:57:55,675
Sorry, Widows.

873
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:58,443
Suck on this, girls!

874
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:03,520
Yes!

875
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:07,023
Very cute.
Very cute indeed.

876
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,795
One for our team, man!

877
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,125
There she is.

878
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,600
Yeah, yeah.
Make the face.

879
00:58:17,669 --> 00:58:19,000
Make the face.
Do it.

880
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:31,978
Exactly

881
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,615
Congratulations, Ruthless.

882
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,479
Hey, Smash.

883
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,048
What's up, Maven?

884
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,150
- Hurl Scouts.
- What up?

885
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,220
I just wanna congratulate
you on your new poster child.

886
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:47,559
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

887
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,657
Yeah, you worked hard
for that, didn't you?

888
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,168
That's really
kind of you.

889
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,669
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

890
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:53,864
You guys hang on a sec.

891
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,200
That's okay.

892
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:59,309
- It's just a French fry.
- Maven, man

893
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:09,544
Yes! Yes!

894
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:11,417
Ruthless, yeah.

895
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,757
- Okay I love it
- I love it.

896
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:18,728
I like banana cream,
but I like chocolate, too.

897
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,596
Food fight!

898
00:59:42,253 --> 00:59:46,121
Gorgeous.
Just beautiful.

899
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:48,520
How's your speech coming?

900
00:59:48,592 --> 00:59:49,786
It's good.

901
00:59:50,594 --> 00:59:52,357
Okay, turn around

902
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,093
What is that?

903
00:59:57,201 --> 01:00:00,193
Oh, it's...
I tripped at work.

904
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:01,862
Are you okay?

905
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:03,471
It's a bruise.
I can handle it.

906
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:05,735
It looks like it'll hurt.
It's fine.

907
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:22,423
You got
to be kidding me.

908
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:26,820
Oh, shit.

909
01:00:28,265 --> 01:00:30,233
This is
an important game, folks.

910
01:00:30,301 --> 01:00:32,565
This is the last game
before the championship.

911
01:00:32,636 --> 01:00:36,003
The winner today
goes on to the big game.

912
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,638
And Ruthless is your lead
jammer and she gets through.

913
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:41,233
And the Scouts
score four points.

914
01:00:41,345 --> 01:00:43,506
The Hurl Scouts have won!

915
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,479
Listen to how high my voice
is. I need an hour of Oprah.

916
01:00:49,587 --> 01:00:50,733
I'm like a woman.

917
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:54,115
I need a
white wine spritzer.

918
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,190
By order
of the fire marshal,

919
01:00:57,294 --> 01:01:00,786
you are hereby ordered
to evacuate the building.

920
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,662
Well, this
game is over, folks.

921
01:01:02,766 --> 01:01:04,961
The Holy Rollers are
already in the championship,

922
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:07,367
so now the Hurl Scouts
will play the Rollers

923
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:10,702
in the championship game
on November 12th.

924
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,039
Come on, man, roller
derby is not a crime.

925
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:14,338
Illegally filling
a warehouse...

926
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:18,278
- ...with too many people is.
- Wait here, I gotta go find Oliver.

927
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,680
Hey, hey, you two.
I need to see your ID.

928
01:01:20,784 --> 01:01:21,842
I was just leaving.

929
01:01:21,952 --> 01:01:25,217
Look, you can show me your
ID, or you can go to jail.

930
01:01:26,357 --> 01:01:29,485
Young lady, what was
that you just disposed of?

931
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:34,456
Seventeen, huh? Don't you think
you're kind of far from home?

932
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:36,496
That's why
I was leaving.

933
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,057
Yeah, good idea.

934
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:42,570
Hey.
Hi, come on.

935
01:01:42,673 --> 01:01:46,404
What do you say? Cherry Slurpees
to celebrate our last night?

936
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:55,879
I gotta find Pash.

937
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,654
Where the hell
have you been?

938
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:03,123
We got a phone call from Pash's
parents at about 3:00 in the morning.

939
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:05,591
That wasn't fun.

940
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:08,734
This is your SAT class?

941
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,570
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

942
01:06:15,644 --> 01:06:17,305
You can't do that.
I paid for those.

943
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:21,109
Hey, you lied, kiddo, all
right? That dog ain't gonna hunt.

944
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,683
Okay all right,
I screwed up.

945
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:27,655
I get it, but what
was I supposed to...

946
01:06:27,756 --> 01:06:28,950
Was I supposed to
ask for permission?

947
01:06:29,024 --> 01:06:30,286
I mean, you would
have just said no.

948
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:32,485
You're damn straight,
we would have said no.

949
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:33,959
What do you think,

950
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:36,429
that the world thinks of those
girls with all their tattoos?

951
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:39,296
Do you think they have an
easy time finding a job?

952
01:06:39,367 --> 01:06:42,268
Or getting
a loan application?

953
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:43,632
Or going to
a decent college?

954
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:45,002
I think it depends
on the girl.

955
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:46,801
Or finding a husband?

956
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,206
No, you just limit
your choices.

957
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,800
Seriously,
you need to stop.

958
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:51,641
You really need
to stop shoving

959
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:55,672
your psychotic idea of '50s
womanhood down my throat.

960
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,145
And pageants? I mean, what
have they ever done for you?

961
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:05,187
That's my point, Bliss!

962
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:06,555
I didn't have a mother..

963
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:10,062
...to navigate all my opportunities.
- Jesus Christ.

964
01:07:10,165 --> 01:07:12,998
I am in love with this.

965
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,963
I mean,
don't you get it?

966
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:18,562
It won't last.

967
01:07:19,074 --> 01:07:22,634
In two or three years, it'll
be over. This is a moment.

968
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,678
Well, how great is that?

969
01:07:26,347 --> 01:07:28,144
You don't understand.

970
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,479
You will when you have
to support yourself.

971
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,813
I do support myself.

972
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:33,376
No, you don't.

973
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:35,250
You buy shoes.

974
01:07:43,097 --> 01:07:45,258
You're full of shit.

975
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,698
You know what,
actually...

976
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:48,860
Hey.

977
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,699
Hey, you calm down,
little lady.

978
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:53,205
Why don't you go back
to your turtle shell

979
01:07:53,274 --> 01:07:56,368
so you don't have to
freaking confront anything?

980
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,946
You all right?

981
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:16,592
I just don't
wanna talk about it.

982
01:08:16,697 --> 01:08:18,688
Pash, come on.

983
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,760
You told me
to wait for you.

984
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:24,064
I was so busy waiting for you
that I didn't notice the cop

985
01:08:24,138 --> 01:08:26,129
coming over to arrest me
for an open container.

986
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,730
Shit, are you okay?

987
01:08:27,808 --> 01:08:29,935
No, actually I'm
not okay, all right?

988
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:34,577
On top of everything, my parents
decided to put a GPS in my car

989
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:37,310
so they can track
my every goddamn move.

990
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:42,289
So what's your problem?

991
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,914
Hope the joyride with your
boyfriend was worth it.

992
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:48,052
Wait, wait.
How is this my fault, okay?

993
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:49,425
I didn't put that
drink in your hand.

994
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:52,329
You know what? I'm ecstatic
that you have this whole new life

995
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:54,264
and you have all new
friends and it's great.

996
01:08:54,335 --> 01:08:58,431
But I'm trying to get out of this
armpit of a town just as much as you.

997
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:00,666
And last time I checked,

998
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:03,766
getting arrested is not
the kind of extracurricular

999
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:06,574
that Ivy League schools
are looking for.

1000
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:11,945
Do you really think that this roller
derby career of yours is going anywhere?

1001
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,277
That's not what
it's about.

1002
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:16,016
Oh, yeah, right.

1003
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:17,681
I'm sorry, Pash.

1004
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,498
Thanks for
letting me stay.

1005
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:29,694
Anytime.

1006
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:35,633
That's Riley back there.
He's my little man.

1007
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,841
So that's why you never
come out with us?

1008
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:43,644
Yeah, he pretty much owns
my ass. Don't you, Rile?

1009
01:09:45,786 --> 01:09:49,222
Okay, first stop, sitter.
Then the Warehouse.

1010
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:03,164
Ruthless, Ruthless,
Ruthless.

1011
01:10:05,071 --> 01:10:06,868
Maven, Maven, Maven?

1012
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:10,575
Hey, guess how old I am.

1013
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:13,839
Twenty-seven?

1014
01:10:13,913 --> 01:10:15,244
Oh, that's sweet.

1015
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,214
I'm 36

1016
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:23,349
Guess when I
started skating.

1017
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,423
I was 31.

1018
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:32,692
'Cause it took me that long to find
one thing that I was really good at.

1019
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,529
And you know what? I
worked my ass off to get it.

1020
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,176
Yeah, me, too.

1021
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:47,773
It's too bad
you're only 17.

1022
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:53,545
What do you think the league is
gonna say when they find that out?

1023
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:57,385
Or your teammates, when they
find out you've been lying?

1024
01:10:57,457 --> 01:10:59,789
That's gonna be rough.
Maven, please. Look...

1025
01:10:59,892 --> 01:11:01,359
No, you look.

1026
01:11:01,427 --> 01:11:04,919
One day it will be your time,
Ruthless, but it's not your time now.

1027
01:11:05,031 --> 01:11:08,967
And if I was you, I wouldn't even
bother lacing up those skates.

1028
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:31,081
Fuck.

1029
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:36,424
It's Oliver, I'm running
with the bulls right now.

1030
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,995
Hey, Oliver.

1031
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:45,160
I just need to talk to you. I...
I'm calling you from a payphone.

1032
01:11:48,274 --> 01:11:50,071
Look, I've left home.

1033
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:57,606
I... You know, this...
I don't...

1034
01:11:57,683 --> 01:11:59,981
I don't wanna do this
on voicemail,

1035
01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:03,783
so maybe you can get me
on Maggie's phone.

1036
01:12:04,857 --> 01:12:08,816
512-697-4998

1037
01:12:10,296 --> 01:12:14,357
And then we can just... We
can talk later. Okay, bye.

1038
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:19,966
- Oink Joint
- Hey, B.

1039
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:21,533
Hey, Bliss.

1040
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:22,801
Is Pash there?

1041
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:26,635
She's not here.

1042
01:12:30,883 --> 01:12:32,475
Yeah, okay.
Bye.

1043
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:49,461
If, you know, you hear a
hint of pain in my voice

1044
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:52,230
when I say that I've
lost my best friend..

1045
01:12:52,337 --> 01:12:55,795
..to a gang of
roller skating she-males

1046
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:59,673
and that the only highlight of my
night was serving corn to an old man

1047
01:12:59,744 --> 01:13:03,680
who can't even chew it,
then I'd say you're wrong.

1048
01:13:06,484 --> 01:13:07,815
I'm happy.

1049
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:27,501
Okay, that was odd.

1050
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,534
Oddly glorious.

1051
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,078
Ruthless, what's up?

1052
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:41,948
I just had something
I wanted to tell you all.

1053
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:44,252
Seventeen!?

1054
01:13:44,356 --> 01:13:45,550
What if you'd
gotten hurt?

1055
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:47,717
Her parents could sue
the league, you guys.

1056
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:48,781
I know.

1057
01:13:48,894 --> 01:13:50,759
We're in enough trouble with
the fire marshal as it is.

1058
01:13:50,896 --> 01:13:52,523
- Exactly.
- You know what? She can still play..

1059
01:13:52,631 --> 01:13:56,089
..as long as she gets permission
from one of her parents.

1060
01:13:58,236 --> 01:13:59,464
I can't.

1061
01:13:59,738 --> 01:14:02,901
I'm not even living
at home right now.

1062
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:07,434
Well, even though you can't skate
with us, and you're a big liar.

1063
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:09,570
You're still
a Hurl Scout.

1064
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:11,976
Yeah, you could
be our mascot.

1065
01:14:17,555 --> 01:14:21,286
You can't understand until you
have one, everything changes.

1066
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:26,089
Yeah, that's what
my mom always says.

1067
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:28,329
But you're not
really like her, though.

1068
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:29,763
Oh, I'm the cool aunt?

1069
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:30,960
Yeah.

1070
01:14:34,506 --> 01:14:38,306
Why don't I just cut school and
hang out with you guys today?

1071
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:41,305
Bliss, I know what it's like
to wanna do your own thing,

1072
01:14:41,413 --> 01:14:42,505
believe me, I do.

1073
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:45,242
But maybe there's
a way you can do it

1074
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:48,150
without making your
parents feel like crap?

1075
01:14:49,187 --> 01:14:51,121
What?
I've just been thinking.

1076
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:54,852
I think maybe you're being a
little selfish with your mom.

1077
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:01,029
Okay, no.

1078
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:05,465
She's the one who has
been shoving her agenda

1079
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:07,767
down my throat
since day one.

1080
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,431
First of all, you're lucky
to have a mom that even cares.

1081
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,306
And just because
she's wrong about derby,

1082
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:17,677
doesn't mean she's wrong
about every single thing.

1083
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:20,978
And if Riley ever lies to me
the way you lied to your parents.

1084
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,519
He wouldn't even be able to run
away 'cause I'd break his legs.

1085
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:27,618
I'm just kidding, honey.
That was a joke.

1086
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:31,828
I am here for you,

1087
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:36,889
but just because you've found a new family
doesn't mean you throw the old one away.

1088
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:51,074
Have a swell day at
school, sweetheart.

1089
01:15:53,584 --> 01:15:54,881
You didn't see that,
did you?

1090
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,329
Please don't
judge me right now.

1091
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:28,075
Whoever he is.
He doesn't deserve you.

1092
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:32,012
Come here.

1093
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:38,086
I feel sick.

1094
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:40,946
I know you do.

1095
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,100
I gave him everything.

1096
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:56,537
No, don't say that.

1097
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:06,871
No, it's true.

1098
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:10,712
I did.

1099
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,073
That's a lot to process.

1100
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:50,915
She was wearing
my Stryper T-shirt.

1101
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:54,091
I just don't understand
how he could do that.

1102
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,664
Your T-shirt?

1103
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,900
It's the only
cool thing you own.

1104
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:01,761
That you'd know about.

1105
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:04,437
Stryper.

1106
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:12,574
Mom, this isn't...

1107
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,850
This isn't working.

1108
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,914
I know.

1109
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,421
You just make me
feel so guilty.

1110
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:27,354
That's not what I want.

1111
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,265
I deserve it sometimes.

1112
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:37,899
Well, I know I can go
overboard sometimes.

1113
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:43,367
But when the person that
you love more than anything

1114
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,313
tells you
that you suck, it...

1115
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:52,915
If you want me to do the Miss
Blue Bonnet pageant, I will.

1116
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:56,049
No, no, no, no.
We're way past that.

1117
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,754
No, it's not a big deal. I
mean, we already got the dress.

1118
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,931
Don't do it for me.

1119
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,298
Fine, I'll do it
for myself.

1120
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,611
Look who's back.

1121
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:21,674
Hi.

1122
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,817
Glad you're safe.

1123
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,525
I shouldn't have said
those things to you.

1124
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,026
Already forgotten, kiddo.

1125
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,778
She's trying to
look pathetic on purpose.

1126
01:20:58,953 --> 01:21:01,717
How long you gonna
hold onto that grudge?

1127
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,295
Thanks.

1128
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,063
Pash, I'm sorry.
You see, I just...

1129
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:20,664
Come on.

1130
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,073
I'm sorry.

1131
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,741
I'm really sorry.

1132
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,144
I know.

1133
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,419
Just keep...
Keep saying it.

1134
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:34,545
Yeah.

1135
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,021
Over and over
again, please.

1136
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,252
Yeah, I will.
I'll keep it up.

1137
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,221
So what happened?

1138
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,765
God, I just feel
like such...

1139
01:21:45,266 --> 01:21:50,499
I'm stupid. I'm just... I feel
so stupid for falling for it.

1140
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,365
Yeah, that's why I like
a good fondling, you know?

1141
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,239
It's so much simpler.

1142
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:02,112
Well, while you were
off gallivanting, I...

1143
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,279
I got some news.

1144
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,852
What... What... What's...

1145
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,281
I got into some colleges.

1146
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:13,886
Wow!

1147
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,192
My parents want me
to go to Johns Hopkins,

1148
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:20,598
but I think I'm
gonna go to Columbia.

1149
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:24,763
I know. I'm gonna see what it's like
to live in New York for a little while.

1150
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,807
That's amazing.

1151
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,739
Do you still have
his stupid jacket?

1152
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:47,120
Did he turn into
a handsome prince?

1153
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:48,820
No, he stayed a Birdman.

1154
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,955
But the worst part is,
he's actually a good kisser.

1155
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:55,893
Really good.

1156
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:58,097
Congratulations
are in order.

1157
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,903
Uh, no. Let's not
encourage this.

1158
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:04,136
I like Birdman.
He's nice.

1159
01:23:04,244 --> 01:23:07,941
Hey, Bliss, somebody on the
phone for you. A Maggie Mayhem?

1160
01:23:09,149 --> 01:23:10,173
Well, look at you.

1161
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:11,273
I got a makeover.

1162
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:12,841
Yes, you did.

1163
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:19,185
Hello.

1164
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:20,624
Ruthless,
it's the championship.

1165
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:23,094
Don't even tell me
you can't make it.

1166
01:23:23,163 --> 01:23:24,187
I can't.

1167
01:23:24,798 --> 01:23:28,199
Is it her mom? Let me talk
to her. I'll knock her out.

1168
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:31,034
Just tell your mom
it's important.

1169
01:23:32,005 --> 01:23:34,769
The pageant is the same day
as the game, and I can't.

1170
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:38,107
Well, you have to try harder and
you have to make it work. We need you.

1171
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:39,645
- Let me talk to her mom.
- Bye.

1172
01:23:39,713 --> 01:23:41,647
I'll kick her in her...

1173
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:44,512
You're selling out.

1174
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,226
"Babe Ruthless."

1175
01:24:03,303 --> 01:24:05,498
A classic
move in derby.

1176
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:08,632
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

1177
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:13,203
Nothing gives you speed like
a whip. Look at Ruthless fly.

1178
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,517
Excuse me, ladies.

1179
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:28,594
I'm looking for Maggie,
Maggie Mayhem.

1180
01:24:33,433 --> 01:24:35,230
Good pageant, y'all.

1181
01:24:38,772 --> 01:24:40,569
Love the dress, Amber.

1182
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:47,439
- We'll have to break through.
- I know.

1183
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:48,945
What time is it?

1184
01:24:51,618 --> 01:24:54,382
- Your gown is custom, huh?
- Yeah.

1185
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:56,718
It's beautiful.

1186
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,087
Thanks.

1187
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,190
Your dress is nice
too Amber.

1188
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:05,629
- Hey.
- Hey.

1189
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:09,026
We need to talk.

1190
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:16,566
Ma'am, put down
the lip gloss.

1191
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,076
Step away from the mirror.

1192
01:25:20,447 --> 01:25:23,143
What are you all doing
here? Are you...

1193
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,074
You're just springing
this on me now?

1194
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:26,642
I know the timing sucks,

1195
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:28,914
but I've been thinking. You
know, I'm not so bothered

1196
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:30,957
by her playing
this roller derby.

1197
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:32,548
In fact, I think
it's kind of neat.

1198
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:35,561
I went on the website, they got
Blisster's pictures all over.

1199
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:37,426
And it looks like they're
having a ton of fun.

1200
01:25:37,497 --> 01:25:41,830
Earl, we just spent a lot of
money on a custom-made gown.

1201
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:44,425
And you want her
to just up and quit?

1202
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:46,937
Yeah, but her team is in
the league championships.

1203
01:25:47,006 --> 01:25:48,769
The game's tonight.

1204
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:52,277
$800, Earl.

1205
01:25:55,281 --> 01:25:57,442
I can take
losing the money.

1206
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:02,344
I cannot take losing the
chance for our kid to be happy.

1207
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,651
- I love her.
- Yeah, she looks nice

1208
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:08,192
- Really sweet.
- Bliss.

1209
01:26:08,294 --> 01:26:09,591
You guys gotta
hide, my mom's coming.

1210
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:12,528
- Bliss.
- Seriously you guys have to hide.

1211
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,960
Bliss.

1212
01:26:16,302 --> 01:26:19,465
Your daddy is about to come in here
and tell you that he thinks it's okay

1213
01:26:19,538 --> 01:26:22,837
for you to go off
and play roller derby.

1214
01:26:23,275 --> 01:26:25,004
- I don't agree.
- Mom.

1215
01:26:25,111 --> 01:26:29,980
When you told me that you weren't
doing the Miss Blue Bonnet for me,

1216
01:26:30,483 --> 01:26:32,280
did you mean it?

1217
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:45,553
Well, good luck.

1218
01:27:03,683 --> 01:27:07,710
Come on, ladies.
What are we waiting for?

1219
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:08,809
Ready to play!

1220
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:11,017
Okay!

1221
01:27:15,094 --> 01:27:16,394
Wait.

1222
01:27:18,689 --> 01:27:20,054
One more thing.

1223
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:24,194
- Yeah, come on, let's go!
- Good luck, Amber!

1224
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,498
Step it up!

1225
01:27:31,677 --> 01:27:33,907
That's when...

1226
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:35,105
Hi.

1227
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:39,882
I got it.

1228
01:27:40,786 --> 01:27:43,448
We just got back into town.
I came straight over.

1229
01:27:43,556 --> 01:27:47,720
I probably still smell
like the van. But...

1230
01:27:48,194 --> 01:27:51,721
I went on your website and saw some
girl wearing my Stryper T-shirt.

1231
01:27:51,797 --> 01:27:53,389
Oh, that girl...

1232
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:56,365
She just climbed
into our van,

1233
01:27:56,435 --> 01:27:59,029
threw on your shirt.
She was an idiot.

1234
01:28:00,706 --> 01:28:03,402
You know, I don't
wanna be this girl.

1235
01:28:03,476 --> 01:28:04,807
What girl?

1236
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:10,277
I don't wanna be the girl
that has to stand here

1237
01:28:10,382 --> 01:28:14,478
and hear about what didn't
happen between you and some idiot.

1238
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:18,647
You don't. And this is bullshit,
anyway. I didn't cheat on you.

1239
01:28:20,558 --> 01:28:23,994
But you never
called, okay?

1240
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:25,426
Okay.

1241
01:28:25,497 --> 01:28:28,796
I know I should've called, but
there was no privacy in the van.

1242
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,391
And then I got
your message and...

1243
01:28:38,676 --> 01:28:40,405
I would've called.

1244
01:28:42,747 --> 01:28:44,942
My mom wants
her shirt back.

1245
01:28:52,357 --> 01:28:54,291
That's right, I'm back.

1246
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:57,490
Thanks a lot for outing me.
That was a class move.

1247
01:28:57,595 --> 01:29:00,689
I didn't out you.
I never said a word.

1248
01:29:01,132 --> 01:29:02,793
I was just
messing with you.

1249
01:29:02,867 --> 01:29:04,801
I don't wanna beat
your ass with rumors.

1250
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:08,134
I wanna beat your ass on
the track with my skates.

1251
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,203
It is
happening tonight, folks.

1252
01:29:11,676 --> 01:29:13,803
There they are,
the coaches shaking hands,

1253
01:29:13,878 --> 01:29:15,505
being nice and diplomatic

1254
01:29:15,613 --> 01:29:18,639
right before the craziest match
that we will ever see here.

1255
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:21,777
Oh, I love it, Austin.

1256
01:29:22,887 --> 01:29:24,115
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1257
01:29:24,189 --> 01:29:26,851
we're talking about the
one and only Iron Maven

1258
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:31,657
versus the upstart from the
heart of Texas, Babe Ruthless.

1259
01:29:32,397 --> 01:29:33,557
Yes.

1260
01:29:36,734 --> 01:29:38,998
Our jammers,
Ruthless versus Maven

1261
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:42,233
head-to-head,
the teams' two top stars.

1262
01:29:42,907 --> 01:29:44,169
As they approach
the pack,

1263
01:29:44,242 --> 01:29:46,972
Ruthless seems to be having an
easier time finding an opening,

1264
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:50,378
slithering through like a
proverbial snake in the grass.

1265
01:29:51,482 --> 01:29:54,349
There's Babe Ruthless,
Iron Maven, neck and neck.

1266
01:29:54,419 --> 01:29:57,183
They've been after each
other the whole time.

1267
01:29:58,089 --> 01:29:59,750
That's a hip check
right there.

1268
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:01,758
You don't see Maven taken
down like that too often.

1269
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,192
Did you see that?
Call it.

1270
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:05,889
That was illegal. What
are you talking about?

1271
01:30:05,997 --> 01:30:07,021
It's a clean hit.

1272
01:30:07,098 --> 01:30:09,191
That was illegal.
Just call that shit.

1273
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:10,928
Calm her down.

1274
01:30:12,103 --> 01:30:14,435
I'll show you ruthless,
Ruthless.

1275
01:30:17,008 --> 01:30:18,532
It's the
second quarter, folks.

1276
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:21,909
We got Babe Ruthless jamming
against the Rollers' Jackie Daniels.

1277
01:30:25,049 --> 01:30:27,176
Finally, I made it
to the promised lands.

1278
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:30,380
Okay, don't embarrass me now
that you're here, all right?

1279
01:30:30,455 --> 01:30:31,615
Never.

1280
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,616
Go, Bliss Go!

1281
01:30:37,228 --> 01:30:39,025
Go, Babe Ruthless!

1282
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:40,189
Go!

1283
01:30:41,132 --> 01:30:42,429
Babe Ruthless
coming in to the pack,

1284
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:43,966
but she's having
trouble getting out.

1285
01:30:44,068 --> 01:30:47,765
That tiny pipsqueak finds a hole,
but not as fast as Jackie Daniels

1286
01:30:47,872 --> 01:30:50,306
breaks out of the pack.
Becomes the lead jammer.

1287
01:30:50,408 --> 01:30:54,400
Rollers just picked up four more
points, bringing the score 24-11,

1288
01:30:54,478 --> 01:30:55,968
Rollers in the lead.

1289
01:30:57,447 --> 01:30:59,312
Slaya takes down Smashley

1290
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:01,447
Oh, but the Mansons
grab those wings

1291
01:31:01,551 --> 01:31:04,884
and Smashley flies after
Slaya like a bat out of hell.

1292
01:31:07,925 --> 01:31:10,257
You just
clotheslined me, man.

1293
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,992
Princess Slaya,
feeling the force now.

1294
01:31:18,468 --> 01:31:21,335
That's gonna hurt tomorrow
in a galaxy far, far away.

1295
01:31:22,606 --> 01:31:24,506
Listen. You play smart,
stay aggressive.

1296
01:31:24,608 --> 01:31:26,769
Don't leave any holes for them
to slip through, all right?

1297
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:29,437
Bliss, this may be time
for Play Number 4.

1298
01:31:29,513 --> 01:31:31,845
LBJ.
Knock them out.

1299
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:36,850
Coach Razor throws
Ruthless in the jammer's seat

1300
01:31:36,954 --> 01:31:38,444
as she makes her way
through the pack.

1301
01:31:38,655 --> 01:31:41,783
Look, she gets a hand from Bloody
Holly and slingshots out front.

1302
01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:42,950
This could be big.

1303
01:31:43,026 --> 01:31:46,655
And one of the Manson sisters
sends Maven hard into the rail.

1304
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:52,195
Maven can yell all she
wants, but she can't hear you.

1305
01:31:52,469 --> 01:31:55,165
No, seriously, she can't
hear you. She's deaf. So...

1306
01:31:58,041 --> 01:32:01,533
I'll tell you what. The Holy Rollers
have got to lay some hits on Ruthless

1307
01:32:01,645 --> 01:32:03,510
if they're gonna have
any hopes of stopping her,

1308
01:32:03,613 --> 01:32:05,945
otherwise she's
just too quick.

1309
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:11,487
All the Scouts dive-bombing
the Rollers, clearing the path.

1310
01:32:11,555 --> 01:32:13,648
Not one schoolgirl
left standing.

1311
01:32:15,559 --> 01:32:18,027
But we are tied as we
go into the halftime.

1312
01:32:18,128 --> 01:32:23,327
Ladies and gentlemen, that
was a game-changing down.

1313
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,335
Okay, Razor, what's
next? Tell us what to do.

1314
01:32:35,412 --> 01:32:38,677
We're gonna run Play Number
7, Rose of San Antone.

1315
01:32:38,749 --> 01:32:40,307
Hey, Smashley, if the
play was called Bong Water,

1316
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:42,716
would you be paying
attention right now?

1317
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:45,083
You know what, I'm taking you
out and putting Ruthless in.

1318
01:32:45,188 --> 01:32:47,588
No! My head
is in the game.

1319
01:32:49,493 --> 01:32:52,087
Then get out there
and prove me wrong.

1320
01:33:00,604 --> 01:33:02,868
Slaya hip-checks
Smashley into the rail.

1321
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:05,601
She's up and over
and she's crowd surfing.

1322
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:08,041
And Smashley Simpson
is back on the track.

1323
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:10,272
Slaya and Smashley have been
at this all season, folks.

1324
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,042
And it looks like Smashley
is speeding towards revenge.

1325
01:33:14,584 --> 01:33:15,573
I hope the medic is ready

1326
01:33:15,685 --> 01:33:19,086
'cause it looks like Slaya's
about to get a rainbow special.

1327
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:21,214
This game's about
to get ugly, folks.

1328
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,717
Walt, I don't
believe this.

1329
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:25,955
Smashley goes for the points
instead of the beatdown...

1330
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:30,621
...and picks up four for her team.

1331
01:33:32,134 --> 01:33:35,467
Okay, we're running Play
Number 10, Pièce de résistance.

1332
01:33:35,571 --> 01:33:37,232
Get back out there
and win it.

1333
01:33:37,306 --> 01:33:38,637
All right.

1334
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:44,042
Let's go, you
know what to do. Get you some!

1335
01:33:44,113 --> 01:33:45,580
The game's still
too close to call,

1336
01:33:45,648 --> 01:33:47,707
but the Scouts may have
some tricks up their sleeves.

1337
01:33:47,783 --> 01:33:50,081
Looks like they're
forming a wall. Kaboom!

1338
01:33:50,152 --> 01:33:54,316
The entire Rollers team is
down as Ruthless flies through.

1339
01:33:55,424 --> 01:33:57,756
Walt, out of nowhere,
Jackie Daniels...

1340
01:34:26,188 --> 01:34:29,624
She's okay, she's okay.
That little munchkin's a trouper.

1341
01:34:29,692 --> 01:34:30,920
Give it up, folks.

1342
01:34:40,302 --> 01:34:43,135
Let's remember that
derby is a brutal sport.

1343
01:34:43,205 --> 01:34:45,969
We've seen our fair share of
sprained ankles and broken bones,

1344
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:48,009
fishnet burns
and black eyes.

1345
01:34:50,179 --> 01:34:52,306
It's the final jam.

1346
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:54,815
Two points
deciding Austin's fate.

1347
01:34:54,884 --> 01:34:57,614
Let me hear you. Folks.
Give it up for these girls.

1348
01:34:59,488 --> 01:35:02,321
It's Iron Maven
versus Babe Ruthless.

1349
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:04,621
Would you have it
any other way?

1350
01:35:04,693 --> 01:35:07,958
The Mansons play Maven in the
middle of a patented cage move.

1351
01:35:09,532 --> 01:35:11,830
They're calling for the whip, and
they just might get what they want.

1352
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:13,562
They got it.

1353
01:35:21,477 --> 01:35:23,001
Go, Maven!

1354
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,972
Ruthless gets out first.

1355
01:35:26,048 --> 01:35:27,982
And now as she gets a hand
from Bloody Holly...

1356
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:31,178
No, Maven sneaks out from the
inside and is heading for the lead.

1357
01:35:31,253 --> 01:35:34,882
But wait, the Manson sisters
line up. A double leg whip.

1358
01:35:51,073 --> 01:35:54,008
Ruthless is surging ahead.
She can taste the victory.

1359
01:35:54,843 --> 01:35:56,834
But no!

1360
01:35:56,946 --> 01:35:58,345
That's it.

1361
01:35:58,414 --> 01:36:01,383
Iron Maven brings
down the anvil.

1362
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:04,283
The Holy Rollers
remain undefeated

1363
01:36:04,386 --> 01:36:07,183
and are league champions
yet again!

1364
01:36:09,757 --> 01:36:11,918
The Holy Rollers
are champs!

1365
01:36:13,962 --> 01:36:18,296
Undefeated three years
in a row. Unbelievable.

1366
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:19,798
What a game.

1367
01:36:20,702 --> 01:36:23,569
You gotta take your hat off to
both teams, ladies and gentlemen.

1368
01:36:23,638 --> 01:36:26,801
As for the Hurl Scouts,
there's always next year.

1369
01:36:28,543 --> 01:36:32,138
But this year it's a
three-peat for the Holy Rollers,

1370
01:36:32,247 --> 01:36:34,442
once again,
three- time champions.

1371
01:36:34,549 --> 01:36:35,709
I'm sorry, Razor.

1372
01:36:35,783 --> 01:36:38,274
Sorry, my ass.
You were great.

1373
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:40,481
Still, who do they
love the most?

1374
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:42,419
Did you see
that leg whip?

1375
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:45,220
How about that jump
by Ruthless?

1376
01:36:45,293 --> 01:36:47,659
Smashley's dive
was hall of fame.

1377
01:36:49,163 --> 01:36:53,395
Yeah!Holy Rollers!

1378
01:36:54,669 --> 01:36:55,761
We did it.

1379
01:36:55,837 --> 01:36:58,328
We're Number 2
We're Number 2.

1380
01:36:58,439 --> 01:36:59,633
We're Number 2.

1381
01:36:59,774 --> 01:37:02,242
We're Number 2.
We're Number 2.

1382
01:37:02,343 --> 01:37:04,106
Ladies, just seeing
you guys run the plays,

1383
01:37:04,178 --> 01:37:06,510
I can't tell you how good
that makes me feel. It's...

1384
01:37:06,614 --> 01:37:07,638
Razor,
are you gonna cry?

1385
01:37:07,749 --> 01:37:08,773
No, I'm not gonna cry.

1386
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,478
It's just it's such
a long time coming.

1387
01:37:11,586 --> 01:37:13,417
I think he might cry.

1388
01:37:18,026 --> 01:37:19,015
Hurl Scouts on three.

1389
01:37:19,127 --> 01:37:21,960
One, two, three
Hurl Scouts!

1390
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:44,951
Nice jump, Evel Knievel.

1391
01:37:45,019 --> 01:37:46,281
Thanks.

1392
01:37:46,354 --> 01:37:48,879
Maybe I'll teach it
to you sometime.

1393
01:37:50,224 --> 01:37:51,452
Really?

1394
01:37:53,895 --> 01:37:55,021
Okay.

1395
01:38:15,316 --> 01:38:17,011
Listen, folks,
it's been another great year

1396
01:38:17,085 --> 01:38:18,677
at the Texas Roller
Derby League.

1397
01:38:18,753 --> 01:38:22,154
I've enjoyed the ever-loving shit
out of you I hope you have, too.

1398
01:38:22,223 --> 01:38:25,192
Come out next year, and
we'll do it all over again.

1399
01:38:25,259 --> 01:38:27,921
And if you would, this is
a residential neighborhood,

1400
01:38:28,029 --> 01:38:30,395
so please don't be too
loud as you head out.

1401
01:38:30,498 --> 01:38:32,864
And whatever you do,
don't drink and drive.

1402
01:38:32,934 --> 01:38:34,925
All right,
thank you, Austin.

1403
01:38:35,036 --> 01:38:37,027
I love you.
I'm out of here.

1404
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:47,911
This is your daughter's
playing card. Might wanna buy it.

1405
01:38:48,014 --> 01:38:49,709
Actually, how
much are these?

1406
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:52,685
- 3 each?
- Yeah.

1407
01:38:54,388 --> 01:38:55,548
It's a piece
of cardboard.

1408
01:38:55,622 --> 01:38:56,884
Yeah, they support the...

1409
01:38:56,957 --> 01:38:58,254
- How much for the shirt?
- Earl.

1410
01:39:08,635 --> 01:39:12,127
I'll tell you what, kiddo, I've
seen some ballgames in my time,

1411
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:16,141
but this...
This was even better.

1412
01:39:34,828 --> 01:39:37,820
I really didn't think
you were going to come.

1413
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,561
I'm really glad you did.

1414
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:46,161
That was scary.

1415
01:39:49,242 --> 01:39:50,334
I...

1416
01:39:51,511 --> 01:39:54,503
I can't change what
you're gonna do, can I?

1417
01:39:59,186 --> 01:40:03,088
Probably not.
I really wanna do this.

1418
01:40:04,191 --> 01:40:06,489
I want to move to Austin,

1419
01:40:07,594 --> 01:40:10,688
and I need to know
that you can accept that.

1420
01:40:13,366 --> 01:40:15,664
That's gonna be
a hard one.

1421
01:40:24,311 --> 01:40:26,541
- In poetry, if...
- It has to be midnight 'cause...

1422
01:40:26,713 --> 01:40:29,181
I know. Okay.

1423
01:40:36,523 --> 01:40:37,956
Hi, Mrs. Cavendar.

1424
01:40:38,024 --> 01:40:39,286
Hi, Amber.

1425
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:40,553
I just wanted to
return the gown.

1426
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,684
Thank you.

1427
01:40:41,795 --> 01:40:43,660
Oh, and Bliss left
this at her station.

1428
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:45,322
I wasn't sure if
she still wanted it.

1429
01:40:45,398 --> 01:40:46,558
Thank you.

1430
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,697
How did you do?

1431
01:40:48,802 --> 01:40:50,394
I came in second.

1432
01:40:50,504 --> 01:40:52,028
Good for you.

1433
01:40:52,138 --> 01:40:53,730
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1434
01:41:08,755 --> 01:41:10,814
"The person I admire most..

1435
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,820
"..is my mother,
because she is a fighter..

1436
01:41:17,898 --> 01:41:20,730
"..who never gives up
on what she believes in..

1437
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:23,930
"..and she never
gives up on me.

1438
01:41:25,104 --> 01:41:29,097
"Obviously, I would be delighted
to win the Blue Bonnet pageant.

1439
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:34,505
"But knowing my mother
is proud of me..

1440
01:41:37,182 --> 01:41:39,412
"..means more than
any crown."

1441
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:19,652
Earl.

1442
01:42:20,392 --> 01:42:21,586
Ronny.

1443
01:43:06,505 --> 01:43:08,029
Wait.
Turn the music up.

1444
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:13,172
Roller derby
is not a crime.

1445
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:16,611
Come on man. Roller
derby is not a crime.

1446
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,527
Undefeated.

1447
01:43:56,555 --> 01:43:57,919
How do I get out?

1448
01:43:58,256 --> 01:43:59,382
There we go.

1449
01:44:00,391 --> 01:44:04,418
Get out. I can't do it
Do it for me.

1450
01:44:15,907 --> 01:44:18,171
Female Fight Club!
Okay, all right.

1451
01:44:26,117 --> 01:44:28,108
I love you.
Oh, I love you.

1452
01:44:43,301 --> 01:44:46,464
Hey, inbreeders, you're
supposed to leave a tip.

1453
01:44:54,912 --> 01:44:57,710
If Jack Black was working
here... is it Jack White?

1454
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:01,108
- He's sexy.
- I like Jack Black.

1455
01:45:01,652 --> 01:45:04,086
Here you go, baby. You have
as much of that as you want.

1456
01:45:04,155 --> 01:45:05,144
Okay

1457
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,820
It's just so funny.

1458
01:45:12,263 --> 01:45:13,321
Hey.

1459
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,628
Fishnets and sexy nicknames.
