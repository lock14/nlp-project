00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,867
All of our</i>
<i>earliest memories are lies,</i>

3
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:08,633
<i>family mythologies</i>
<i>handed down to us repeatedly</i>

4
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:11,266
<i>until they become as real</i>
<i>as what actually happened.</i>

5
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,005
Get the door, Mama.

6
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:21,951
<i>You may be king,</i>
<i>you may possess the world and it's gold</i>

7
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,884
<i>But gold won't bring you happiness</i>

8
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:30,394
<i>When you're growing old</i>

9
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:36,663
<i>The world still is the same,</i>
<i>you never change it</i>

10
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:39,235
Get the damn door, Mama.

11
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:43,637
<i>As sure as the stars shine above</i>

12
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,777
No one in the family can say</i>
<i>exactly when my mother went crazy.</i>

13
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:52,441
<i>According to Grandma,</i>
<i>she was always that way.</i>

14
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:54,280
Get the damn door, Mama.

15
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:57,321
<i>Dad said it started</i>
<i>when she lost the babies.</i>

16
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:01,154
<i>Seven miscarriages in eight years</i>
<i>can tend to do that to a person.</i>

17
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,989
<i>That's why my arrival on the scene</i>
<i>came as somewhat of a surprise.</i>

18
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,958
<i>I was born with the umbilical cord</i>
<i>wrapped around my neck.</i>

19
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:11,661
<i>I've been pissed off ever since.</i>

20
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:37,049
<i>The world still is the same,</i>
<i>you never change it</i>

21
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,959
The miscarriages had taken</i>
<i>such a toll on Mom</i>

22
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:43,933
<i>that she somehow got it in her head</i>
<i>that she'd lost me as well.</i>

23
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:52,342
<i>Well, you're nobody</i>
<i>'til somebody loves you</i>

24
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:59,449
<i>So find yourself somebody to love</i>

25
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,763
Shortly after I was born,</i>

26
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:23,170
<i>my mother drove me to California</i>
<i>and placed me in a Catholic orphanage.</i>

27
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:26,939
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>about my earliest memories there,</i>

28
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,343
<i>but the truth is, no one knows.</i>

29
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:41,216
<i>Back home, she claimed I had died at birth</i>
<i>and couldn't tell anyone where I was.</i>

30
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,384
What?

31
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:46,990
<i>Two years later, after another miscarriage,</i>

32
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:49,828
<i>she suddenly remembered</i>
<i>where she'd left me.</i>

33
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,802
<i>Despite all of Mom 's craziness,</i>
<i>Dad never stopped loving her.</i>

34
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,962
<i>But they divorced,</i>

35
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:57,838
<i>and I was passed around</i>
<i>like an unwanted Christmas fruitcake.</i>

36
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:14,251
<i>Eventually, my mother decided</i>
<i>she needed to be a full-time mom again,</i>

37
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,953
<i>and that we needed a fresh start.</i>

38
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,052
<i>I disagreed.</i>

39
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,189
- You'll have your own room.
- I already have my own room.

40
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:22,289
I'll get you bunk beds.

41
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:25,426
But why do I need bunk beds?
I'm an only child.

42
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,202
<i>It wasrt all bad.</i>
<i>The best thing in my life was my dad.</i>

43
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:34,873
<i>His name was Dell Fong,</i>
<i>and he was Chinese.</i>

44
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,413
<i>I identify him as being Chinese,</i>

45
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,005
<i>because his race</i>
<i>is the most vibrant memory I have of him.</i>

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,177
Richard, that's not safe.
Come on, time to work.

47
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,220
Maybe you can be a cook, too, someday.

48
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,609
<i>I could never be a cook like my father</i>

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
<i>because I'd already made</i>
<i>my career choice.</i>

50
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,908
<i>Superhero.</i>

51
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,386
<i>As a superhero, you occasionally</i>
<i>have to deal with something annoying,</i>

52
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,047
<i>like Kryptonite.</i>

53
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,353
<i>My Kryptonite was called home.</i>

54
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:26,996
<i>My mother had this ritual.</i>

55
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:30,431
<i>Every year, she'd celebrate the birthday</i>
<i>of each of the children she miscarried</i>

56
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:34,369
<i>by buying them a birthday card</i>
<i>and taking an overdose of sleeping pills.</i>

57
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,497
<i>That happened seven times a year.</i>

58
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:40,533
<i>I wouldn't call her successful at suicide,</i>
<i>but she was punctual.</i>

59
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,283
<i>My dad's Kryptonite?</i>

60
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:54,182
<i>Soy sauce.</i>

61
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:16,138
"Most people go to their graves
with their music inside them."

62
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,274
What was Mr. Holmes saying?

63
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,288
Come on, guys, it's not that hard.

64
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,382
He's saying that most people die

65
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,953
without discovering their own genius,

66
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,195
without expressing the uniqueness
that makes them special.

67
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,260
And that's what
this little exercise is about.

68
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:46,901
I want you to give me three minutes
about something, anything that you know,

69
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:49,445
that your classmates may not know.

70
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,685
Mr. Pimentel, I like your spirit.
Come on up.

71
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,456
Butt kisser.

72
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,022
Funny how things happen.</i>

73
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,361
<i>Only in hindsight do you realize how</i>
<i>something as small as raising your hand</i>

74
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:10,559
<i>can change your entire life.</i>

75
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:17,699
Well, have any of you ever eaten chicken
at the Golden Dragon,

76
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,936
the Rickshaw Gardens
or the Chinese Gardens?

77
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,535
Well, you know the restaurants
don't buy live chickens, right?

78
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,342
They buy dead ones.

79
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,044
And you know where they get those
chickens and how those chickens die?

80
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,282
I do, 'cause I killed them.
I killed your dinner.

81
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:35,758
I've chopped the head off chickens
for every Chinese restaurant in the city.

82
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:38,158
You find the biggest knife you can find,

83
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,198
then you have to grab the chicken
by the lower of its neck and swing...

84
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:44,029
<i>I could've talked for hours.</i>

85
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:47,935
<i>Mr. Parks was almost as happy as I was,</i>
<i>because he ran the speech club.</i>

86
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:50,872
warnings of</i>
<i>approaching missiles over the Arctic.</i>

87
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>And in other news, Soviet Premier</i>
<i>Khrushchev has made great strides</i>

88
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:58,812
<i>in his policy towards peaceful coexistence</i>
<i>with non-Communist countries.</i>

89
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:02,410
And I believe Premier Khrushchev
has made great strides

90
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:07,549
in his policy towards peaceful coexistence
with non-Communist countries.

91
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>I may not have been</i>
<i>the most original speaker,</i>

92
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,085
<i>but I became a star.</i>

93
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:15,258
<i>Forget that superhero dream,</i>
<i>now I knew what I really wanted to be.</i>

94
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,624
Mom?

95
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:51,029
<i>I forget whose birthday it was this time.</i>
<i>I just know it wasrt mine.</i>

96
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:56,362
<i>My mother ended up surviving</i>
<i>only to leave me a few months later.</i>

97
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,671
<i>It didn't matter, though,</i>
<i>because I had plans.</i>

98
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,868
<i>Things didn't happen</i>
<i>as quickly as I expected.</i>

99
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,670
<i>A few years after high school, I got a job</i>
<i>working in the kitchen of a go-go bar</i>

100
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:35,234
<i>to earn money for college.</i>

101
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:39,874
Richard, I need that order 10 minutes ago.
I don't pay you to stand around.

102
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:47,715
<i>I still had my dream,</i>
<i>but there were a few distractions.</i>

103
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:56,364
<i>Bambi was a visual effect</i>
<i>that would only be rivaled years later</i>

104
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,867
<i>by my first viewing of</i>Star Wars.

105
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:12,245
Tiff, you're exposed.

106
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,111
What are you working on?

107
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:18,416
There's a tournament
at Portland State University,

108
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,184
and it's open to anybody.

109
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:23,055
So I figured if I went there
and I did really well, I might get noticed,

110
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,823
and who knows, maybe a scholarship.

111
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,158
No shit.

112
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,030
- What are you gonna wear?
- I don't know. Probably a sweater.

113
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,564
Oh, honey, no way.

114
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:40,705
You see that guy over there?
He owns the biggest mers store in town.

115
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,973
Girls.

116
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:01,061
<i>Did you hear about the midnight rambler?</i>

117
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:04,931
<i>Everybody got to go</i>

118
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:08,836
<i>Did you hear about the midnight rambler?</i>

119
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:09,895
Well done.

120
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,736
Yeah, thank you, sir.

121
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,235
Hey.

122
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:18,981
Mr. Pimentel?

123
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,678
I'm Ben Padrow with the University.
I'm chairman of the Speech Department.

124
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,721
Hi, Dr. Padrow, I know who you are.

125
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,382
Well, congratulations. I'm impressed.

126
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,047
Nice suit.

127
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,252
Oh, thank you very much.

128
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:31,351
Where do you go to school?

129
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,453
Actually, sir, I'm not in school right now.

130
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,330
I'm a little strapped financially.
But I'd love to come to State.

131
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:41,428
Well, we have scholarships
and financial aid. We'd love to help.

132
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:42,699
Come see me.

133
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,035
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:08,455
You're late.

135
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,227
I'm sorry. I was over at the admissions...

136
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,564
No time for apologies.
On the stage, let's go, come on.

137
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,730
I picked three speeches, like you asked.
Now, which one do you wanna see first?

138
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:18,206
The good one. Tick, tock. Come on.

139
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,640
All right.

140
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:29,549
Last meal's been eaten.

141
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,347
Last prayer has been said.

142
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:35,754
The prisoner is strapped
into the electric chair...

143
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:39,523
My black brothers will gladly sacrifice
for freedom overseas

144
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,894
when there's freedom in Birmingham...

145
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:47,426
...until my right to vote in this country
precedes my obligation to die for it.

146
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,707
Just sit down there, please. Right here.

147
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:06,854
You like it up there?

148
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,289
Yeah, I...

149
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,521
I like it better than anything.

150
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:12,687
Why?

151
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,696
I don't know.

152
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,289
Stop right there.

153
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:20,268
That's the first honest thing you've said,
"I don't know."

154
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:24,899
You don't know why you're up there.
You don't even know what you're saying.

155
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,374
Sure, you're talented and passionate.

156
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:29,173
You could fool some blue-haired judge
in high school, but not here.

157
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:31,180
This is another league.

158
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,142
Wait a minute, I...

159
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:38,211
I've won every single tournament
I've ever entered.

160
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,688
You didn't think that I was good?

161
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,524
I think you're the most gifted,
natural speaker I have ever seen,

162
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,564
and you have incredible potential.

163
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:50,191
And you are completely full of shit.

164
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:57,966
Hold on, wait a minute. So that's it?

165
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,805
I've been working towards this
for the last six years, all right?

166
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:03,813
I'm not asking... It doesn't have to be
a full scholarship. I can...

167
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,645
Look, my advice? You're not ready.

168
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,085
Go live a life. Fill yourself up.

169
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,384
Find out what's important,
earn a point of view.

170
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,481
- I...
- Earn.

171
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:18,824
Earn a point of view. Then come back
when you've got something to say.

172
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,823
"Get a life,"my ass.</i>

173
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:52,953
<i>I had a life, and there was no way</i>
<i>I was going back to it.</i>

174
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,157
<i>Fortunately, the government</i>
<i>had this program</i>

175
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:58,724
<i>where you could gain valuable</i>
<i>life experience and see the world.</i>

176
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:03,068
<i>They would guarantee your education</i>
<i>in exchange for services rendered.</i>

177
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,039
<i>It was called Vietnam.</i>

178
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:16,043
<i>Now my girl you're so young and pretty</i>

179
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,718
<i>And one thing I know is true</i>

180
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,223
<i>My reaction may have been a bit hasty.</i>

181
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:28,628
<i>After six months in country,</i>
<i>life in Portland didn't seem all that bad.</i>

182
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,964
<i>Watch my daddy in bed a-dyir</i>

183
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:35,732
<i>Watched his hair been turnirgrey</i>

184
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:39,674
<i>He's been workirand slavirhis life away</i>

185
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:43,008
<i>Oh, yes, I know it</i>

186
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:45,206
<i>Yeah</i>

187
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:49,343
<i>- He's been workir so hard</i>
<i>- Yeah</i>

188
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,911
<i>- I've been workir too, baby</i>
<i>- Yeah</i>

189
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,015
<i>Every night and day</i>

190
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:58,687
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

191
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:01,895
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

192
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,966
<i>If it's the last thing we ever do</i>

193
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,696
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

194
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:15,643
<i>'Cause girl, there's a better life</i>
<i>for me and you</i>

195
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,276
So we're gonna move off this hill
before they decide to take it from us.

196
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:28,791
I need four volunteers to stay behind.
This is your chance to be a hero.

197
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,654
I always wanted to be a hero.

198
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,593
All right, there we go. I need three more.

199
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,599
<i>Watch my daddy in bed a-dyir</i>

200
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:43,572
<i>- Yeah</i>
<i>- Every single day</i>

201
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:52,543
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

202
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,414
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

203
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:59,119
<i>If it's the last thing we ever do</i>

204
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,582
Sector One. Sector One. We need help!
Under fire in the sector. Over.

205
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,321
Let's move!

206
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,158
We're out. Let's go. We're out.

207
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:13,768
What you did out there took courage.
Know your outfit is proud of you.

208
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:17,238
I just wanted you to understand
that I'm personally proud of you.

209
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:18,797
I got something planned for you
you can enjoy,

210
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,002
while you're right here in Vietnam.

211
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,340
Carry on.

212
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,750
<i>Come here, sister</i>

213
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,987
<i>Papa 's in the swing</i>

214
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,820
Oh, the mother Iode.

215
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,626
Who needs a medal, huh?

216
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,721
I don't want a medal, man.

217
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,799
<i>He ain't no drag</i>

218
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,995
To surviving the surviving.

219
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,130
<i>Papa 's got a brand new bag</i>

220
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:53,741
<i>Come here, mama</i>

221
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,041
<i>And dig this crazy scene</i>

222
00:17:57,814 --> 00:18:00,908
<i>He's not too fancy</i>

223
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,752
<i>But his line is pretty clean</i>

224
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:08,050
<i>He ain't no drag</i>

225
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,351
Bring it on, gooks.

226
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,893
<i>Papa 's got a brand new bag</i>

227
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,463
Incoming!

228
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,548
Richard! Point to where it hurts.
Can you hear me?

229
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:43,884
<i></i>

230
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,833
You got tinnitus. It's ringing in the ears.

231
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,502
I can't hear you.

232
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,182
<i></i>

233
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,741
You're lucky.
You only lost half your hearing.

234
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,754
Your friends lost theirs completely.

235
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:14,655
If I'm deaf,
why do I hear this noise all the time?

236
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:17,784
You lost your upper register,
and hearing aids won't help.

237
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:20,329
By the time you can hear
those high sounds,

238
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:23,230
the low sounds will be so loud,
you'd go crazy. You understand?

239
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,393
Can you just make the noise stop?

240
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,437
I can't. That's tinnitus.

241
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:32,066
Some days will be better than others,
but it won't stop.

242
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,067
Ever.

243
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:38,777

244
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,435
<i></i>

245
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,148
This is my letter of acceptance
to the university.

246
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:20,553
And I also brought
a couple of recommendations.

247
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:22,990
No, no, I can't authorize this.

248
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:27,126
I'm sorry. Could you speak up
and look at me when...

249
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:28,562
Thank you.

250
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:33,425
I can't authorize government funds
to send you to college.

251
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,629
Why?

252
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,103
You're deaf.

253
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:39,136
I'm what?

254
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,574
It's a deaf joke.

255
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:46,147
You're worse than deaf, you're confused.

256
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:48,912
You can hear only vowels, no consonants.

257
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,377
Yeah.

258
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:53,547
Well, if you can only hear vowels,
you've got two choices,

259
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:56,217
learn to read lips or move to Hawaii.

260
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:01,591
I don't wanna go to Hawaii,
I wanna go to college.

261
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,235
Listen, even if you graduate,
they won't be able to place you.

262
00:21:06,303 --> 00:21:07,827
Why? 'Cause I'm deaf?

263
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:09,531
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
She had a job.

264
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,699
- No.
- No, I know she had a job...

265
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,902
No, because of the ringing.

266
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:17,173
- Night and day, right?
- Yeah.

267
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,215
- In both ears?
- Uh-huh.

268
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:22,809
You won't be able to concentrate.
You'll forget what you've read.

269
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:24,581
You won't have any friends.

270
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,316
You'll be incompetent
and you'll be foul-mouthed.

271
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,823
No shit?

272
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,358
You know what?
Who the hell are you, huh?

273
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,925
You got a desk and a clipboard.
You don't know me.

274
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,563
'Cause if you did, you'd know
how close I am to coming over that desk

275
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,699
and shoving that clipboard
up your fat, pompous ass.

276
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:49,506
I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna
graduate, and then I'm gonna get a job,

277
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,480
and you can stick that
in your goddamn chart.

278
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:04,155
You ungrateful piece of shit!

279
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:05,626
Get your hands off me, bro!

280
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:07,094
- Don't touch me.
Get the hell out of here.

281
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:09,996
Don't fucking touch me.
- Don't come back.

282
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,840
Hey, bro, could you hold it a sec?

283
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:27,007
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

284
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,724
What the hell's wrong with you?

285
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,226
Thanks, man.

286
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,330
Damn thing only lights half the time.

287
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:53,036
Hell, I only work half the time myself.

288
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,276
You don't say much. Got a light?

289
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:01,813
Buddy, you got a light?

290
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:04,115
Hey, man, you deaf?

291
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,321
Yeah, I am.

292
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,619
I heard that. I lost a wheel.

293
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:12,322
Fucking peaceniks.

294
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,858
I'd hate them a lot more
if I didn't agree with them.

295
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:17,126
You wanna get a beer?

296
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,224
What?

297
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:21,464
A beer. A brew. Cold one.

298
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,369
It's 10:00 in the morning, man.

299
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,464
So?

300
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,433
No, no thanks.

301
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:36,149
Mike Stolz.

302
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,146
Mike.

303
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:40,152
Richard.

304
00:23:40,223 --> 00:23:41,588
Like Nixon?

305
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:46,455
That's awesome. Here you go, bro.

306
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,520
That shit's good for you.

307
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:04,779
They overran us. Swarmed us, bro.

308
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:08,348
And it's just me and Jimmy left,
and I'm like...

309
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:10,852
I'm fucking gone. Fuck Jimmy, bro.

310
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,416
And I fucking stand to run,

311
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:18,552
and Jimmy pulls me down
and greases this guy that was right on me.

312
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:20,887
I never saw him.

313
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,328
Jimmy saved my life.

314
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:28,228
Then I look over, tell him, "Let's go, bro."

315
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:32,271
And Jimmy's head was just gone.

316
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:41,006
Motherfuckers!

317
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:53,589
He saved my life.

318
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:58,494
And God forgive me, bro,
I was gonna leave him there.

319
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:09,237
What the fuck, man?
Can nobody afford a decent roach clip?

320
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:14,674
Look at this shit.
What the fuck is this, bro?

321
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,723
Clearly, Kesey's expressing
his hatred for conformity.

322
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,453
Yeah, he's celebrating the individual,

323
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,222
but I think it's more about
the abuse of power.

324
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,627

325
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:29,562
The individual is disengaged
from the society, although...

326
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:32,123
I think it's more about the abuse of power.

327
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:35,171
As a result, he acts
as a spiritual and emotional...

328
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:37,365
...authority figure, right?

329
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:39,733
I...

00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,906
I forgot something.

00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,923
Look like you have a coke problem.

342
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:37,586
May I?

343
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:40,687
I...

344
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:43,126
I don't...

345
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,499
Yeah, don't bother, all right? I'm deaf.

346
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:52,335
I can read lips, but not that well.
Those are gonna make me seasick.

347
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:57,903
You're welcome.

348
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:04,041
All right.

349
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,880
Damn boy scout.

350
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,993
You think you're too good to talk to me?

351
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:18,830
Wait a minute, I understood that.

352
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:21,233
You want a fucking medal?

353
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,067
No, I wanna hug you.

354
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:27,739
How about I shake your hand? Richard.

355
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,337
Art.

356
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:36,282
You better wash your hands.

357
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:41,346
This may be contagious.

358
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,021
You wanna sit down, Einstein?

359
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,825
Yeah, sure.

360
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:49,922
You wanna...

361
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:52,331
The only person on the planet</i>
<i>that I could hear</i>

362
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,701
<i>was a wickedly obscene genius</i>
<i>with cerebral palsy.</i>

363
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:58,536
<i>And the only person that could</i>
<i>understand him was a deaf vet.</i>

364
00:28:58,608 --> 00:29:00,974
<i>We were like a traveling freak show.</i>

365
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:02,510
How old is that chair, anyway?

366
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:05,513
I saw tanks in Nam
smaller than that thing.

367
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:07,913
No.

368
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:11,181
Why the hell would I need a new one?

369
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,955
There's nowhere for me to go.

370
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,289
Hey, watch it!

371
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,691
Oh, sorry.

372
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,353
Can't you go forward in that thing?

373
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,557
Yeah, sure, if you blow me.

374
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:26,332
What? What's so funny?

375
00:29:26,402 --> 00:29:27,426
What'd she say?

376
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:30,131
Oh, she just wants to blow me.

377
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,197
What did that spaz say?

378
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:37,178
Art is what I'm called.
A work of art, some would say.

379
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,148
Support Art and blow me.

380
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:45,779
He said he's very, very sorry,
and he'll try to be more careful.

381
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:47,982
- Yeah, right.
- Freaks.

382
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:49,718
Oh, and blow him.

383
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:18,209
This reminds me of my childhood.

384
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:20,982
You used to skate?

385
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:26,893
I used to sit here with the grandmas

386
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:29,591
and watch everyone else skate.

387
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:35,395
Times they are a-changing.

388
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,665
Yeah.

389
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,332
Are you a good skater?

390
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:41,808
Oh, hell no.

391
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:44,779
<i>It's your thing</i>
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

392
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,508
Oh, yeah.

393
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:49,511
<i>I can't tell you</i>

394
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,610
<i>Who to sock it to</i>

395
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:54,019
<i>It's your thing</i>

396
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,456
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

397
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,758
<i>I can't tell you</i>

398
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,626
<i>Who to sock it to</i>

399
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:04,097
<i>If you want me to love you</i>

400
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,930
<i>Maybe I will</i>

401
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:10,097
<i>I need you woman, it ain't no big deal</i>

402
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,402
Go faster, go faster.

403
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:16,411
<i>You need love now, just as bad as I do</i>

404
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:19,673
<i>Make's me no difference now</i>

405
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:22,115
<i>Who you give your thing to</i>

406
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:23,913
<i>Oh, it's your thing</i>

407
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:26,621
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

408
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,486
- Whoa, watch it.
- Hey!

409
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,390
Art! Honeyman, stop!

410
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:41,168
I can't tell if he's hurt or not.

411
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:43,029
Art, are you okay?

412
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:47,132
I was kicking ass
till this chick knocked me down.

413
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,473
She's dangerous.

414
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:50,944
You okay?

415
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:53,982
- Yeah, next time use a blinker.
- Ah, yeah.

416
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:10,997
Wait here.

417
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:15,864
You're a lousy date.

418
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,010
Are you listening to me?

419
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,513
You wanna repeat that to my face?

420
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,875
- What?
- What did you say?

421
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,713
- What?
- You heard me.

422
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:30,945
No, I didn't, actually, I'm deaf.

423
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,647
But I can see
what you're saying from over there.

424
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:35,088
Hey, easy, tiger.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

425
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:37,853
First of all, you're eavesdropping
on a private conversation.

426
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,758
Secondly, I can say whatever I want.

427
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,354
Yeah? So can I. You're an asshole.

428
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:43,591
My friend is not a retard.

429
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,601
Actually, he's probably smarter
than the three of us put together.

430
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:48,193
He's certainly smarter than you.

431
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,034
He's got cerebral palsy.
See, it affects his motor skills.

432
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,938
It means that his brain
is perfectly functioning

433
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,102
while his body is more or less useless.

434
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,304
If you have a little trouble
wrapping your head around that,

435
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,440
think of it as the opposite of you. Asshole.

436
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,885
Who the hell is this guy?

437
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:13,992
I'm sorry about my friend.

438
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:16,554
Yeah, I'm sorry for you, he's a jerk.

439
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:18,429
Sometimes.

440
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,698
You didn't have to threaten him.
That was puerile.

441
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,439
What'd she say?

442
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:26,407
She said you're a dick.

443
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:28,735
Oh.

444
00:33:29,578 --> 00:33:31,671
You know what, why don't you
just head back over to your friend?

445
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:33,806
The two of you deserve each other.

446
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:35,714
What is your problem?

447
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:41,146
You believe that?

448
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:43,157
She's a fox.

449
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:46,353
You should've asked her out.

450
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,590
What are you talking about?
She just called me a dick.

451
00:33:48,664 --> 00:33:51,531
Actually, she said you were immature.

452
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,692
What?

453
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,795
How come you said "dick"?

454
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,771
Because it was funnier.

455
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:29,193
<i>Sunshine came softly</i>
<i>through my a-window today</i>

456
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:36,567
<i>Could've tripped out easy</i>
<i>a- but I've a-changed my ways</i>

457
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:42,808
<i>It'll take time, I know it</i>
<i>but in a while</i>

458
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:47,450
Oh. You.

459
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:50,287
Yeah, remember me? Immature guy.

460
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:52,691
Yeah. I got class.

461
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:53,820
Oh, I'll walk you.

462
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,261
No, thanks.

463
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:57,799
<i>You're going to be mine</i>

464
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,759
<i>I'll tell you right now</i>

465
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:03,100
<i>Any trick in the book now, baby</i>

466
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:06,403
<i>All that I can find</i>

467
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:23,887
It's sold out.
How are we going to get in, genius?

468
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,120
We'll figure that out.

469
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:28,527
What if that guy's coming?

470
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,792
Then the two of you can hold hands.
Don't worry about it.

471
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,731
Okay, here she comes.

472
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:40,842
No. You're Richard?

473
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,539
Oh, my God, this is so trippy.
What are the odds?

474
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,104
Where's your friend? He's not coming?

475
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:49,014
Nikos? Nah.

476
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:51,945
Aw, man.

477
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,549
I don't think this is a good idea.

478
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,287
Come on. You need the gas money,
we need the ride.

479
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:04,492
Look, come on, I'll be nice.
I promise. Please?

480
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:07,960
Yeah, well, if you're mean, I'll leave you.

481
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:11,598
All right, that sounds fair.
Art, that sound fair to you?

482
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:15,832
- Art thinks that's fair.
- Oh, come on, baby. I'll drive.

483
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:19,204
<i>I like to dream</i>

484
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:23,012
<i>Yes, yes, right between my sound machine</i>

485
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:27,215
<i>On a cloud of sound I drift in the night</i>

486
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,519
<i>Any place it goes is right</i>

487
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:33,323
<i>Goes far, flies near,</i>
<i>to the stars away from here</i>

488
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:37,923
<i>Well, you don't know what we can find</i>

489
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,434
<i>Why don't you come with me, little girl</i>

490
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,561
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

491
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:46,472
<i>You don't know what we can see</i>

492
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,737
<i>Why don't you tell your dreams to me</i>

493
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,938
<i>Fantasy will set you free</i>

494
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,052
Are you guys coming?

495
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:01,112
Yeah, we'll be right in.

496
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:07,793
Pardon me.

497
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:10,487
Hi.

498
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,231
You better not molest me back here.

499
00:37:14,303 --> 00:37:17,500
I have a plan. Bite me.

500
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:18,835
Do what?

501
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:22,400
Oh, my God, he's got me! Help!

502
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:25,675
Help! For the love of God,
somebody help me! Help!

503
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,739
No, no, he's contagious. He'll get you, too.

504
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,909
Go, go get help. Hurry!

505
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:44,025
<i>When the truth is found to be lies</i>

506
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:51,264
<i>And all the joy within you dies</i>

507
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,808
You didn't have a ticket, did you?

508
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,070
Sorry?

509
00:37:55,144 --> 00:37:57,578
You didn't have a ticket, did you?

510
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:59,238
<i>Don't you need somebody to love?</i>

511
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:02,512
<i>Wouldrt you love somebody to love?</i>

512
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:07,146
Hey, hey. I really can't see
anything from here.

513
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:09,918
<i>You better find somebody to love</i>

514
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,154
Hey!

515
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:18,159
That is so uncool.

516
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:25,232
<i>Yes, and your mind</i>

517
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:26,535
Better?

518
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:30,100
<i>Your mind is so full of red</i>

519
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:33,671
<i>Don't you want somebody to love?</i>

520
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:36,240
<i>Don't you need somebody to love?</i>

521
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,162
You knew it was me, didn't you?

522
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:56,263
All my signs disappeared off the campus
and you're the only one that called.

523
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:01,674
I like that.

524
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,581
I need to shower.

525
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:46,111
You know, I just can't stop
thinking about last night.

526
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:47,212
Jesus Christ!

527
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,723
Hey, morning, Tarzan.

528
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:53,751
I'd invite you in, but I don't think
there's room for both of us in here.

529
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,559
- Hey, babe.
- Hey. You remember Richard.

530
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:57,621
Uh-huh.

531
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:00,994
What, do you guys, like, live together?

532
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,537
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

533
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:05,664
What, are you guys, like, friends or what?

534
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,536
We have an open relationship.

535
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:13,709
You look a little confused, man.
You need me to draw you a picture?

536
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:19,516
You just spent the night with me
and you sleep with this guy, too?

537
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:21,613
I'm not confining myself.

538
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,662
So are you trying to get back at me?

539
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,066
No, Richard, this is my life.

540
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:39,096
We had fun last night, right?
I like you, but I like Nikos, too.

541
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,533
Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.

542
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:45,503
I can't handle this shit.

543
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,113
Richard?

544
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,347
Richard, I know you hear me.

545
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:56,016
Look, I guess I should've warned you.

546
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,820
Maybe before I looked in the shower.

547
00:40:57,893 --> 00:41:01,852
Well, let's just have fun. I mean,
we don't even know what we have yet.

548
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,422
I think what we have
is one too many sausages in the bun.

549
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:10,200
Look, I like to have fun, too,
but your idea of fun is a testicle tag team.

550
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:12,263
No, that's... Wrong guy.

551
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,575
You're old-fashioned. That's cute.

552
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,342
Am I going to see you again?

553
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:24,841
Hmm?

554
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:26,579
Okay.

555
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:30,424
Here's how this works.

556
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:36,820
If you're with me,
when you're with me, you're with me.

557
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:40,198
I don't wanna hear about him,
I don't wanna see him,

558
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,238
I don't wanna smell him.

559
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,204
That's fair.

560
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,674
<i>Well, I don't know why I came here tonight</i>

561
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:59,445
<i>I got the feeling that something ain't right</i>

562
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:03,713
<i>I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair</i>

563
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:06,492
<i>And I'm wondering</i>
<i>how I'll get down the stairs</i>

564
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:08,393
Pass the towel, baby.

565
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:11,796
<i>Clowns to the left of me</i>
<i>Jokers to the right</i>

566
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:15,598
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>Stuck in the middle with you</i>

567
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:19,232
<i>Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you</i>

568
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:22,840
<i>And I'm wondering what it is I should do</i>

569
00:42:23,412 --> 00:42:27,212
<i>It's so hard to keep this smile from my face</i>

570
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:30,979
<i>Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place</i>

571
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:34,886
<i>Clowns to the left of me</i>
<i>Jokers to the right</i>

572
00:42:34,957 --> 00:42:38,449
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>Stuck in the middle with you</i>

573
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,927
<i>Well, you started out with nothing</i>

574
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:43,396
<i>And you're proud</i>
<i>that you're a self made man</i>

575
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:45,524
<i>Please</i>

576
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,265
<i>Please</i>

577
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:52,731
Your grades are excellent.

578
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,669
You're a decorated veteran.

579
00:42:56,745 --> 00:42:59,612
You mind telling me
where you were wounded?

580
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:05,351
I don't usually divulge that information
till the second date.

581
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,615
So what do you wanna do
with your life, Richard?

582
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:14,253
I wanna help people.
And make a lot of money.

583
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:18,558
Yeah!

584
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,202
After graduation,</i>
<i>I lied about my experience</i>

585
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:27,572
<i>and got a great job</i>
<i>with an insurance company.</i>

586
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:29,804
<i>They had no idea I was deaf.</i>

587
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:33,245
<i>

588
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:48,628
Right here.

589
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:53,329
Careful.

590
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:55,461
Where do you want this?

591
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:58,563
Yeah, right... Over here.

592
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:07,539
Hey.

593
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:13,718
- What do you think?
- I love it.

594
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:15,620
Nobody's asking for handouts, man.

595
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:18,683
All these cats here,
they all wanna work, bro.

596
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:22,321
They just need somebody
to front them, you know?

597
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:28,268
Some buttoned-down asshole who's
already got his nose up the mars ass.

598
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:36,000
Somebody with a job, bro.

599
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,876
Yeah, somebody like me.

600
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:40,471
Good idea, bro.

601
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:45,810
<i>I will give you those things</i>
<i>you thought unreal</i>

602
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:49,651
<i>Follow me now and you will not regret</i>

603
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:02,668
New shirt?

604
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:20,879
Baby, the phone.

605
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:30,925
Hello?

606
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,497
Wait, whose birthday?

607
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:48,347
They better be
the best pancakes on the planet.

608
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:54,317
Forget it, I'm not hungry anymore.

609
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,150
Oh, that's funny.

610
00:45:57,692 --> 00:45:59,887
- You know what else is funny?
- What?

611
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:03,055
A guy with CP
rolling down a flight of stairs.

612
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:13,163
Hey, buddy, can you hold that for...

613
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:15,534
Thank you, appreciate that.

614
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:39,124
Hi.

615
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:48,471
Just here.

616
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,471
Yes, your highness.

617
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:53,037
- You want your coat on or off?
- Off.

618
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:54,103
Okay.

619
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:01,186
All right.

620
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:04,114
You need a menu?

621
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:07,293
No, no. I...

622
00:47:07,362 --> 00:47:09,023
I know what I want.

623
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:11,822
Good evening.

624
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:14,233
I mean, good morning.

625
00:47:14,302 --> 00:47:15,394
Hi.

626
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,836
Hey, we'll just have the pancakes.

627
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:19,032
Yeah.

628
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:26,670
Actually, my manager
told me that we can't serve.

629
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:29,876
- You can't serve pancakes?
- Why? They...

630
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:31,976
They got them.

631
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:34,521
Look, I don't want to sound rude...

632
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,650
No, no, no. You're not rude, it's...
I'm the only one who understands him.

633
00:47:41,062 --> 00:47:43,929
I'm trying my damnedest
to not make this a scene.

634
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,593
Good. I don't feel there is one.

635
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,766
I think you two need to leave.

636
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,706
You're making the other customers
very uncomfortable.

637
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh.

638
00:47:57,379 --> 00:47:58,607
Why?

639
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:02,573
Hey, we can refuse to serve
whoever we want here.

640
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:03,777
You gotta be kidding me.

641
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,412
It's my friend's birthday.
All he wants is pancakes.

642
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:09,355
I... I think

643
00:48:09,424 --> 00:48:12,621
she needs some hot man love.

644
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:16,395
Maybe. I'll ask her,
but I don't think she's your type, Art.

645
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:19,193
Okay, don't you dare.

646
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:23,431
You are the ugliest,
most disgusting thing I have ever seen.

647
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:26,065
I thought people like you died at birth.

648
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:29,008
How do you expect people
to eat around you?

649
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:31,170
Normal people
shouldn't even have to look at you.

650
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:32,577
Listen, lady.

651
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:34,675
I'm

652
00:48:40,956 --> 00:48:43,151
sorry if I'm

653
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:51,928
doing your job for you.

654
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,665
He says he's very sorry
for turning your customers' stomachs.

655
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:58,672
- That's obviously your job.
- Yeah.

656
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,335
Okay, you know what?
You guys can leave, or I can call the police.

657
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,900
Oh, oh, wait.

658
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:16,421
Call them.

659
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:23,563
That night we were arrested for</i>
<i>violating what was known as an Ugly Law.</i>

660
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:26,601
<i>This law made it a crime</i>
<i>for anyone to appear in public</i>

661
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:30,069
<i>who was diseased,</i>
<i>maimed or deformed in any way</i>

662
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:32,629
<i>so as to be</i>
<i>an unsightly or disgusting object.</i>

663
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:34,101
Hey, hey, buddy.

664
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:42,009
Watch it, dickwad.

665
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:46,679
<i>No parkirby the sewer sign</i>
<i>Hot dog, my razors broke</i>

666
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:51,715
<i>Water drippir up the spout</i>
<i>But I don't care, let it all hang out</i>

667
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,992
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

668
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:05,271
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

669
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,839
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

670
00:50:13,148 --> 00:50:15,844
That horrible waitress</i>
<i>had done me a huge favor.</i>

671
00:50:16,484 --> 00:50:20,386
<i>I'd been trying to hide from my past.</i>
<i>She made me embrace it.</i>

672
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:27,386
<i>I quit my nice, high-paying job</i>
<i>and went to work for a real jerk.</i>

673
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:28,656
<i>Me.</i>

674
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:40,474
I cold-called every business</i>
<i>in the phone book.</i>

675
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:44,706
<i>I wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>
<i>I found jobs for every vet I knew,</i>

676
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:48,044
<i>and in the process,</i>
<i>I found a life calling for myself.</i>

677
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,680
All right, Richard,
let's see how this sounds.

678
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:02,027
Dr. Collins,</i>
<i>please call extension 21-10, stat.</i>

679
00:51:02,097 --> 00:51:03,462
<i></i>

680
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:06,728
<i>Dr. Collins, please call extension 21-10.</i>

681
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:09,770
At that time, the only people</i>
<i>vets trusted were other vets,</i>

682
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,864
<i>so I got a job at a government agency</i>
<i>helping them find work.</i>

683
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:14,841
What is it that you're afraid of,

684
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,978
that he can't work with you,
or that you can't work with him?

685
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:22,883
You had to stop
and think about that, didn't you?

686
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:28,014
<i>As soon as I was hired,</i>
<i>Mike said he wanted a job.</i>

687
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,113
<i>Nothing tickled him more</i>

688
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,091
<i>than trying to tear down a system</i>
<i>that made no sense to him.</i>

689
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,354
<i>Mike was a natural headhunter.</i>

690
00:51:33,428 --> 00:51:35,259
I'm like Chinese water torture, lady.

691
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,788
I'm gonna keep calling you back
till you pull your head out of your ass.

692
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:41,461
Listen, lady, listen to me.

693
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:43,436
I left my leg in a rice paddy.

694
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:45,336
I get a big, fat check every month.

695
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,397
I don't need to be
begging work for these guys.

696
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:48,635
But they need me.

697
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,302
And they need
somebody like you with balls

698
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:53,472
to give them a freaking chance
to make your company better.

699
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,542
What?

700
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:59,649
Yeah? Well, amen, sister.

701
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,520
Listen, maybe you and I
could get a drink sometime.

702
00:52:05,994 --> 00:52:08,792
All right, maybe not. All right, take care.

703
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,588
The word was out.</i>

704
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:15,727
<i>I could find jobs for any disabled person,</i>
<i>veteran or otherwise.</i>

705
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:19,740
She's a file clerk and she hasn't missed
a day of work in 20 years.

706
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:22,299
Sounds good.</i>
- Tell him I'm a dwarf. Tell him.

707
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:24,809
<i>- Can she start tomorrow?</i>
- Yeah. And she's a dwarf.

708
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:26,743
<i>- A what?</i>
- A dwarf.

709
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,179
<i>How the hell can a dwarf be a file clerk?</i>

710
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,776
She specializes in L through Z.

711
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,850
- I have a step stool, stupid.
- She got a step stool. Come on.

712
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,726
<i>- Okay, I'll give her a shot.</i>
- Right.

713
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,954
<i>- Have her come in tomorrow.</i>
- Great.

714
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,944
Hello?

715
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:09,217
Is this the Governor's office?

716
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:14,925
Yeah, well, this is Richard Pimentel.
I have a note to return a call.

717
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:17,156
Okay.

718
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,162
Hello.

719
00:53:24,072 --> 00:53:25,266
Yes, sir.

720
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,035
Well...

721
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:31,610
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much. I certainly try.

722
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,012
'Cause you're an ungrateful piece of shit.
'Cause you're selfish.

723
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,607
What kind of offer?

724
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:37,673
What?

725
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:41,017
What? You wanna fucking take me on?
You wanna take me on, tough guy?

726
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:44,422
Yeah, I would love
to talk about that. Absolutely.

727
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:46,221
I don't give a shit, man.

728
00:53:46,628 --> 00:53:48,152
Okay. Thank you very much.

729
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:50,390
Listen, bro, how about
I come down there right now

730
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:53,195
and I beat you to death
with my plastic leg?

731
00:53:53,268 --> 00:53:55,293
What? When?

732
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:58,063
You can start tomorrow?

733
00:53:58,139 --> 00:53:59,333
He'll be there.

734
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:03,741
Hey, bro, listen, you're doing
a great thing for a vet, man.

735
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:06,173
Don't fuck it up.

736
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:16,056
- To our future.
- Absolutely.

737
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:23,656
So, when the Governor's office
called me last week...

738
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,164
Whoa. Excuse me?

739
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,292
I guess his office
had heard something about me.

740
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:32,772
I don't remember the exact words,
but something like innovator or genius.

741
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,104
- But you don't remember?
- No, not the exact words.

742
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:36,803
Anyway, the upshot is

743
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:41,306
they want me to create a program

744
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:45,011
to train employers to hire
and work with the disabled persons.

745
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:49,250
- Seriously? Honey, that's amazing.
- That's what I thought.

746
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:50,621
What were they doing before?

747
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:53,354
There is no before.
This is the first time they've done this.

748
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:56,420
- I'd be starting from scratch.
- Well, you little groundbreaker, you.

749
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,761
You heard about this for a week
and you never told me?

750
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:02,166
Well, I didn't know
it was going to be definite yet.

751
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:05,296
And the bad news is
I'd have to quit my job.

752
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:07,807
But the good news is,
is that once the program was created,

753
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:11,003
they wanna send me around
the country and train all the trainers.

754
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:14,478
So the good news is you'll be traveling?

755
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:17,575
Yeah. If you want to,
you could come with me for some of it.

756
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:21,419
What's wrong?

757
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:25,255
I just... Nothing. Nothing.

758
00:55:26,494 --> 00:55:28,621
Well, come on, you seem bummed.

759
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:30,220
I'm not bummed. It's...

760
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:34,026
It's just that I hardly see you now as it is,

761
00:55:34,102 --> 00:55:36,730
so what's it going to be like
when you start traveling?

762
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:40,262
No, no. This... Look,
this is a completely different job. Okay?

763
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:42,332
When I'm in town, I'm gonna be at home.

764
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,371
I've been working a lot lately
and you've been really great about that.

765
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:48,915
This is a really big deal.

766
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:51,445
I know.

767
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:56,921
Okay. I'm proud of you.

768
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,626
So when are you gonna tell Mike
you're leaving?

769
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:05,264
Mike's the hardest worker you got, okay?
He's a little bit volatile.

770
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,528
He's a ticking time bomb.

771
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:09,968
He's effective.
That's the important thing, right?

772
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:12,006
He's completely out of control.

773
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,674
What happens when you're not here
to baby-sit him?

774
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:19,178
As it is, no one wants to work with him.

775
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:21,738
The people that he got work for
will work with him.

776
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:25,809
Look, I'll talk to him. This job is his life.

777
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:29,320
I don't care.

778
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,022
I want him gone.

779
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:41,467
I'm on time, bro. I'm never late.

780
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:44,698
I wear nice clothes.

781
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,968
Who's placed more people than me,
even more than you?

782
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:50,408
No doubt, I know.

783
00:56:51,345 --> 00:56:54,712
You got an unorthodox style, man.
It makes management nervous.

784
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,511
So when are you leaving, man?

785
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,746
I go in a week.

786
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,785
Fucking A, brother. You're gonna be great.

787
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:06,985
Thanks.

788
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,027
Look, man, I don't have to do this
if you're not...

789
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,499
No, don't worry about me.

790
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:17,503
I'm a survivor, brother. I'm gonna be fine.

791
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:21,964
Yeah.

792
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,457
<i>Sometimes late when things are real</i>

793
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:52,495
<i>And people share the gift of gab</i>
<i>between themselves</i>

794
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,473
<i>Some are quick to take the bait</i>

795
00:57:57,545 --> 00:58:00,275
<i>And catch the perfect prize</i>

796
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:03,283
They wanted me to write</i>
<i>the book on hiring the disabled.</i>

797
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:07,185
<i>I finally had something to say,</i>
<i>I just didn't know how to say it.</i>

798
00:58:07,255 --> 00:58:10,315
<i>But oz never did give nothing</i>
<i>to the tin man</i>

799
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:14,889
<i>That he didn't, didn't already have</i>

800
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:20,701
<i>And cause never was the reason</i>
<i>for the evening</i>

801
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:25,738
Come on, guys.
Now, I don't wanna see text in your eyes.

802
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,831
Has he told you yet you're full of shit?

803
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:32,571
'Cause if you're any good he will, trust me.

804
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:38,485
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Richard Pimentel,

805
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:40,282
the best student I never had.

806
00:58:41,756 --> 00:58:43,519
That's all for today, thank you.

807
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:48,556
<i>Tilting at Windmills.</i> You a Quixote fan?

808
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,419
Yeah.

809
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:54,467
I was reading it one night
and I had an epiphany.

810
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,366
You know, the hardest thing
about being disabled

811
00:58:56,437 --> 00:58:58,496
is the way that other people treat you.

812
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:02,037
Employers, they don't wanna
hire people with disability.

813
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,508
Why is that?

814
00:59:03,578 --> 00:59:05,671
They lack confidence in us.

815
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:11,415
- I think you may have that wrong.
- What do you mean?

816
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:14,454
You don't need to change their minds
about people's disabilities,

817
00:59:14,522 --> 00:59:17,616
you need to change their minds
about themselves.

818
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:22,921
I wanna show you something.

819
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:32,298
- Lithium?
- Yeah.

820
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:35,935
I'm what they call a manic-depressive.

821
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:38,809
That medicine you're holding
allows me to function.

822
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,813
I don't share that with a lot of people.

823
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,042
For years,
I didn't wanna accept what I was.

824
00:59:44,252 --> 00:59:46,720
The day you auditioned for me
was not a good day.

825
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:49,956
No, I got a life 'cause of you.

826
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:53,152
- You could've lost it because of me.
- I make my own decisions.

827
00:59:54,562 --> 00:59:56,223
I lost my hearing.

828
00:59:57,765 --> 01:00:00,495
I gained a superpower, lip-reading.

829
01:00:00,568 --> 01:00:03,799
I can spy on conversations
a hundred feet away.

830
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:08,336
I could have some fun with that
at those god-awful faculty lunches.

831
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:14,575
- So you don't wear hearing aids?
- No, they don't help.

832
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:19,917
I get them from the government, but I just
pass them out like candy for Halloween.

833
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:24,988
Do me a favor,
I want you to meet someone.

834
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:43,571
- Richard?
- Yeah.

835
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,612
Bill Austin. Come on back with me.

836
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:49,973
- Right in here, please.
- All right.

837
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:53,709
No offense,
but this is all kind of a circle jerk.

838
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,756
I'm just here to humor Ben.

839
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:58,690
See, I have this ritual with Uncle Sam
every year where he tells me

840
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:00,727
how much more deaf I am
than the year before,

841
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:02,490
and then I cash his disability checks.

842
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,224
Well, there doesn't seem to be
too much purpose

843
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:07,597
in living a life with a hearing problem
if we can find the right solution.

844
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:08,965
Wait, wait.
What are you gonna do with that thing?

845
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:10,594
I'm going to stick it in your ear,

846
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,333
unless you have another place
you'd rather I stick it.

847
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,606
Ear's good.

848
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,849
Now we're ready to try
the new hearing aids.

849
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:25,476
Is that them?

850
01:01:25,553 --> 01:01:28,420
They're like a contact lens for the ear.

851
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,616
We've found that
smaller's better.

852
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:34,388
We get a more efficient coupling
for the ear when the aid is in the canal.

853
01:01:34,462 --> 01:01:36,089

854
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,190
Can you hear me, Richard?

855
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:44,331
How does it sound? Can you hear me?

856
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:45,736
<i></i>

857
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:47,398
Can you hear me?

858
01:01:56,117 --> 01:01:58,176
Oh, yeah. That's great.

859
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:09,693
<i>Wash away my troubles</i>
<i>Wash away my pain</i>

860
01:02:09,764 --> 01:02:13,291
<i>With the rain in Shambala</i>

861
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:16,800
<i>Wash away my sorrow</i>
<i>Wash away my shame</i>

862
01:02:16,871 --> 01:02:19,806
Once I started writing again,</i>
<i>it was like I tapped a vein.</i>

863
01:02:19,874 --> 01:02:22,809
<i>My central focus was</i>
<i>to change the attitudes of employers</i>

864
01:02:22,877 --> 01:02:25,141
<i>about persons with all disabilities.</i>

865
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,407
<i>It took me a year to write.</i>

866
01:02:28,883 --> 01:02:33,081
<i>Ah, ooh, yeah</i>

867
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:36,385
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

868
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:40,257
<i>Everyone is helpful</i>
<i>Everyone is kind</i>

869
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:43,956
<i>On the road to Shambala</i>

01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:47,899
<i>Everyone is lucky</i>
<i>Everyone is so kind</i>

871
01:02:48,903 --> 01:02:50,666
<i>On the road to Shambala</i>

872
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:58,308
What page are you on right now?

873
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:02,110
I'm on page shut the fuck up.

874
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,870
I've got CP, I'm not deaf.

875
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:33,141
All right, come in.

876
01:03:45,493 --> 01:03:47,984
Come on, man. Say something.

877
01:03:50,231 --> 01:03:54,167
Why did you want me to read this?

878
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,962
'Cause I don't think
I know what I'm doing, Art.

879
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,872
But I never would've written that
if I hadrt met you.

880
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,977
Now, you're the smartest guy that I know,

881
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:08,173
and if you don't think that's any good,
I'm just gonna tear it up.

882
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,913
You don't have

883
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:17,756
a clue...

884
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:21,124
- All right, shit.
- No, let me finish.

885
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:29,394
You don't have a clue how good this is.

886
01:04:33,574 --> 01:04:38,477
You know what we cripples want

887
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:41,606
besides getting laid?

888
01:04:41,682 --> 01:04:44,150
To be seen.

889
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,855
When they look at me out there now,

890
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:51,723
you know what they see?

891
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:55,489
Nothing.

892
01:04:56,697 --> 01:04:58,096
I'm ignored.

893
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:01,963
How can you ignore this?

894
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:05,562
But they ignore me,

895
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:09,031
because

896
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:14,142
I am so disturbing

897
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:18,878
to their definition of human,

898
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:23,512
that I make them feel.

899
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,327
I love that.

900
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:33,299
What you've created

901
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:38,934
will help to make them see us.

902
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:45,202
If you try to tear this up,

903
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,405
I'll kick your ass.

904
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:53,408
All right.

905
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:57,149
<i>

906
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:00,350
I threw myself into my career.</i>

907
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:03,453
<i>I was changing lives and ignoring my own.</i>

908
01:06:04,765 --> 01:06:08,462
<i>I was keynote speaker for</i>
<i>the US government, training every agency.</i>

909
01:06:08,535 --> 01:06:13,131
<i>CIA, NASA, the VA, all of them.</i>

910
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,903
<i>My own subversive little goal</i>
<i>was to make the federal government</i>

911
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:19,343
<i>into the biggest employer</i>
<i>of disabled persons in the country.</i>

912
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:23,346
<i>Mike would've dug the irony.</i>

913
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,653
Richard, we made plans
for this months ago.

914
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,059
Why did you wait till now
to tell me you can't go?

915
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:39,998
- I just forgot all about it. I'm sorry.
- So tell them that.

916
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,831
It's an important conference,
I'm the speaker.

917
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:45,235
I can't just not show up,
people count on me.

918
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,829
And I don't?

919
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:50,343
They're strangers at a convention,
an audience.

920
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:51,605
They applaud, you eat it up.

921
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:54,375
So I have to wonder,
are you doing this for them or for you?

922
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:57,440
I'm doing it for them
and I'm doing it for me.

923
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:03,387
We'll do something special
when I get back.

924
01:07:04,158 --> 01:07:05,250
Okay?

925
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:12,322
Richard, this is important to me.
I'm asking you not to go.

926
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:15,095
Stop it! I am not doing this right now.

927
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,971
I'll call you from the hotel.

928
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:35,044
<i>Until you've seen</i>
<i>this trash can dream come true</i>

929
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:41,918
<i>You stand at the edge</i>
<i>while people run you through</i>

930
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:46,726
<i>And I thank the lord</i>

931
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:50,398
<i>There's people out there like you</i>

932
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:52,531
<i>I thank the lord</i>

933
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:56,667
<i>There's people out there like you</i>

934
01:08:00,948 --> 01:08:05,078
<i>While Mona Lisas and mad hatters</i>

935
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:08,883
<i>Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers</i>

<i>For unless they see the sky</i>

938
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:29,137
Hey, baby, it's me.
I know it's late, but pick up if you're there.

939
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:34,573
Hello? Just wanna say that</i>

940
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:37,774
<i>today went really well</i>

941
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:40,982
<i>and I wanted to see how you were doing</i>

942
01:08:41,054 --> 01:08:44,455
and tell you that I miss you a lot.

943
01:08:45,726 --> 01:08:46,886
And...

944
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:52,290
Pick up if you're there
'cause I really wanted to tell you that I...

945
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:53,594
<i></i>

946
01:08:57,571 --> 01:08:59,334
I think I messed up.

947
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:20,657
Christine?

948
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:25,762
Christine?

949
01:09:49,223 --> 01:09:50,451
Oh, boy.

950
01:09:50,824 --> 01:09:53,349
The minute I turn my back,
you come sniffing around.

951
01:09:54,962 --> 01:09:56,224
You just don't get it, do you?

952
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:58,958
Just go get Christine
before I have your visa revoked.

953
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:01,393
It's okay, Nikos.

954
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,709
You've been seeing him behind my back?

955
01:10:16,783 --> 01:10:19,718
No. I'm just here until I find my own place.

956
01:10:20,854 --> 01:10:22,651
I'm not getting back with Nikos.

957
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:24,657
- Does he know that?
- Of course.

958
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,220
You two sleeping
in the same bed together?

959
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:30,388
- Jesus. You don't get it.
- What?

960
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,461
I just want you to come home.

961
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:37,328
- I'm not coming home.
- Why?

962
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,873
Is this because
I don't give you enough attention?

963
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:44,138
No, it's because
I don't give me enough attention.

964
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:45,769
I've always depended on men like you

965
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:48,576
to make me feel better
and take care of me.

966
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:49,946
I need to be on my own.

967
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:52,747
All right, well, be on your own.
Be on your own with me.

968
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,853
I mean, I'm traveling,
I can give you all the space you want.

969
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:01,291
I'm flailing here, okay?
I don't know what you want me to say.

970
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:06,028
- I love you. I wanna be with you.
- You don't wanna be with me.

971
01:11:08,068 --> 01:11:12,368
You just wanna win me and put me
on a shelf to remind you that you won me.

972
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:16,273
That's not a relationship, Richard,
I think we need to be apart.

973
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:20,408
I need to figure out who I am and...

974
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,678
And I think you need to figure out
what's important to you, too.

975
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:44,898
Margaret, you have a visitor.

976
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:46,567
Hi, Mom.

977
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,502
How you feeling?

978
01:11:55,882 --> 01:11:58,612
The doctors tell me I'm doing well.

979
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:03,144
But I don't feel like it, and neither do I.

980
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:09,327
Schizophrenia humor. That's good, Mom.

981
01:12:10,063 --> 01:12:11,690
You know what I miss?

982
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:15,066
Dancing.

983
01:12:15,969 --> 01:12:19,370
You know who was a good dancer?
Richard.

984
01:12:20,774 --> 01:12:22,503
Not really.

985
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:27,843
He took foxtrot, cha-cha, tango lessons.

986
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:31,116
I used to take him to the nightclubs.

987
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,516
Oh, we had so much fun.

988
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:35,578
No, Mom, actually, I didn't.

989
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:38,783
No 12-year-old boy
really wants ballroom dancing lessons.

990
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,520
That's a lie.

991
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:47,698
- Why'd you do it for two years?
- So that I could be with you.

992
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,137
I wanna take a nap now.

993
01:13:01,982 --> 01:13:04,815
- But your son came so far to visit you.
- That's all right.

994
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,615
That's all right. That's okay, it's fine.

995
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:13,457
Here, I wanna give you something.

996
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:18,191
This is a new standard for disability
training for employers nationwide,

997
01:13:18,265 --> 01:13:19,789
and I wrote it.

998
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,201
I don't feel like reading anything.

999
01:13:29,276 --> 01:13:32,302
Well, I just wanna tell you, Mom,
I'm doing great.

1000
01:13:32,379 --> 01:13:35,007
I love my job, I'm making a difference.

1001
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:40,479
What do you want?

1002
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:45,285
You want me to pat your hand,
say you're a good boy?

1003
01:13:45,358 --> 01:13:47,349
I'm not wired that way.

1004
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:04,908
The average able-bodied person
doesn't give a damn about the disabled.

1005
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:07,469
Would we care about womers rights
if they hadrt mobilized?

1006
01:14:07,547 --> 01:14:09,981
We're not gonna care about
disabled people

1007
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,451
until they set aside their differences,
stop being invisible,

1008
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,818
and come together
for the passage of the ADA.

1009
01:14:15,889 --> 01:14:17,948
That would be the Americans
with Disabilities Act, am I right?

1010
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:19,787
Yes, exactly,
Americans with Disabilities Act.

1011
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,523
This bill, simply put, says that
you can't discriminate against people

1012
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:26,122
simply because they don't look like you.

1013
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:28,599
Okay. Why don't we hold that thought
right there until...

1014
01:14:28,668 --> 01:14:30,966
Now that the election
has come down to Bush and Dukakis,

1015
01:14:31,037 --> 01:14:32,834
I have it on very good authority

1016
01:14:32,906 --> 01:14:36,364
that the very first candidate who
comes out publicly in support of the ADA

1017
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:39,310
is gonna get the disabled vote.
The whole thing, all of it.

1018
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:42,439
Everybody, which is
millions of votes for the first candidate

1019
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,381
that has the balls
to come out and support this.

1020
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:46,316
- Richard, please, just...
- One second.

1021
01:14:46,386 --> 01:14:51,983
Rumor has it that one of our senior
elected officials was told by his advisors,

1022
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:54,891
okay, "Sir, we have a problem.

1023
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:56,451
"There is a horrific disease.

1024
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,591
"It is infecting homosexuals
and drug addicts at an alarming rate,

1025
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,464
"and it is always fatal."

1026
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,902
And you know what he said?
You know what his reply was?

1027
01:15:04,971 --> 01:15:07,872
He said,
"What did you say the problem was?"

1028
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:12,606
That is the kind of Nazi Germany
mentality that we're looking at

1029
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:16,080
here in America, in the late 20th century.

1030
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:19,312
That's it. We're off the air, all right?

1031
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:24,781
Somewhere along the way</i>
<i>I realized my heart wasrt driving me.</i>

1032
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:26,325
<i>My anger was.</i>

1033
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:29,194
<i>I think Art noticed it first.</i>

1034
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:32,464
You're a complete asshole.

1035
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:38,604
You used to be a partial one,
but you graduated.

1036
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,571
How the hell did you get in here?

1037
01:15:41,641 --> 01:15:44,201
When you're not looking, I can walk.

1038
01:15:48,014 --> 01:15:51,677
So you're too busy
to see your friends anymore?

1039
01:15:51,751 --> 01:15:55,084
Too deaf to hear the phone ring?

1040
01:15:55,155 --> 01:15:57,350
You know what?
Don't bring your wobbling ass in here

1041
01:15:57,424 --> 01:16:00,484
and try and guilt-trip me, all right?
You know who I lectured last week?

1042
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,549
I do.

1043
01:16:01,628 --> 01:16:04,426
The CIA, man. Fucking CIA.

1044
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:07,260
I'm doing great.

1045
01:16:09,936 --> 01:16:11,927
But you don't look great.

1046
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:15,134
Yeah? Well, who's this?

1047
01:16:16,176 --> 01:16:19,441
"But you don't look great."

1048
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:37,654

If Bush wins, you know what that means?

1070
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,235
That means I'm gonna have to
renovate this whole place

1071
01:18:25,305 --> 01:18:26,738
just to service these retards.

1072

You know what that's gonna cost me?

1073
01:18:28,141 --> 01:18:29,938
No, what's it gonna cost you?

1074
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:33,968
I'm just talking about
this Disabilities Act, it's gonna...

1075
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,742
Yeah, what's it gonna cost you?

1076
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:38,511
It means I have to put in ramps,
I have to put in all these kinds of things.

1077
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:41,213
It's gonna wind up...
It's gonna be a big deficit.

1078
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:45,621
Right. You might have to spend, what,
$1,000 to get a wheelchair ramp

1079
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:48,490
and widen a toilet stall
so somebody can take a piss?

1080
01:18:49,095 --> 01:18:50,255
Sir...

1081
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:53,324
I don't mean anything by it, all right...

1082
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,800
Yeah, you do.
I'm one of those retards, okay.

1083
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:57,427
I lost my hearing in the war.

1084
01:18:57,504 --> 01:19:00,268
You wanna talk about
how much that's gonna cost you?

1085
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:05,343
Tell you what, go ahead.
Go ahead, talk about it, all right?

1086
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,804
I won't listen. Say something funny.

1087
01:19:09,549 --> 01:19:10,811
Tell him.

1088
01:19:10,984 --> 01:19:13,885
Why don't you tell him a joke
about a guy who's got a 180 IQ

1089
01:19:13,953 --> 01:19:17,116
but he a has a brain disorder
so he can't tie his shoe?

1090
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,214
Huh?

1091
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:22,159
Or a world-class skier who breaks her neck
and now she needs a machine to breathe?

1092
01:19:22,228 --> 01:19:24,128
That's funny stuff.

1093
01:19:24,197 --> 01:19:26,495
And poor you, 'cause now you gotta
sink a little bit of money

1094
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:29,467
into this piece-of-shit restaurant.

1095
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:33,434
You know what? Here you go.

1096
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:39,309
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Buy yourself a conscience.

1097
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:48,417
Richard? Richard, it's me.

1098
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,950
Hey, Christine.

1099
01:19:51,024 --> 01:19:52,992
It's been a while. How are you?

1100
01:19:53,593 --> 01:19:56,619
Good, yeah, I'm just...
I'm meeting some friends.

1101
01:19:57,564 --> 01:19:59,657
So are you still
leading seminars, traveling...

1102
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:01,222
Yeah. Yeah, it's good,

1103
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,792
- it's going really well.
- Yeah? I'm glad. How's Art?

1104
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,566
The same old Art. Is that your husband?

1105
01:20:07,407 --> 01:20:08,431
No.

1106
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:15,209
No? You know, it's strange to see you.

1107
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:17,749
I was thinking about you
just the other day.

1108
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:22,015
Thinking about you a lot, actually.
I... Well...

1109
01:20:22,088 --> 01:20:24,386
I was remembering the trip to Seattle.

1110
01:20:24,457 --> 01:20:26,948
I'm engaged. He's my fianc.

1111
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:30,893
Well, is it hot in here
or is my life going up in flames?

1112
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:33,398
- Richard...
- I'm kidding.

1113
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:36,731
Well, I'm gonna go.

1114
01:20:38,972 --> 01:20:40,439
Are you okay?

1115
01:20:41,274 --> 01:20:43,504
Yeah, absolutely.

1116
01:20:50,483 --> 01:20:52,610
He's just an old friend.

1117
01:20:54,988 --> 01:20:56,512
<i></i>

1118
01:20:56,589 --> 01:21:00,923
Mr. Pimentel, it is urgent that you</i>
<i>call us back regarding your mother.</i>

01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:03,758
<i></i>

1120
01:21:25,652 --> 01:21:27,415

1121
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,358
Richard, open the door!

1122
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:41,931
- Hey.
- There's a gas leak. Can't you smell that?

1123
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:54,136
What are you doing, Richard?

1124
01:21:56,482 --> 01:21:58,382
Why would you do that?

1125
01:22:00,954 --> 01:22:02,216
She died.

1126
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,290
My mother finally died.

1127
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:15,598
It's okay.

1128
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:27,774
It's hot.

1129
01:22:29,749 --> 01:22:31,546
I feel like an idiot.

1130
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,885
All the shit I've dealt with,
and the thing that gets me

1131
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:40,858
is I can't get some mentally ill woman
I barely know to ever love me.

1132
01:22:40,927 --> 01:22:44,658
Well, that's not your fault.
She's the one that was damaged.

1133
01:22:45,098 --> 01:22:48,397
And she missed being close
to a really great person.

1134
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:53,336
What are you doing here, anyway?

1135
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:57,702
I was worried about you.
And I came to thank you.

1136
01:22:58,778 --> 01:23:02,043
If not for you, I wouldn't be
as happy as I am now.

1137
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:06,345
I don't think that's a compliment.

1138
01:23:06,419 --> 01:23:08,319
No, it is, it is.

1139
01:23:09,422 --> 01:23:12,619
I learned a lot from you.
And I came to apologize.

1140
01:23:13,993 --> 01:23:17,793
I never told you how glad I am
that you're a part of my life.

1141
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:21,259
So after spending my whole life
trying to prove myself

1142
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:23,666
to someone that was not capable
of accepting me,

1143
01:23:23,736 --> 01:23:27,900
I finally realized I actually had something
in common with my mother,

1144
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:31,034
that neither of us much cared
whether or not I lived.

1145
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:32,941
But I didn't like that.

1146
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:36,004
So I did what she could never do.

1147
01:23:36,816 --> 01:23:38,579
I accepted myself.

1148
01:23:39,585 --> 01:23:41,075
Two years ago,

1149
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:44,885
the Americans with Disabilities Act
was passed through Congress.

1150
01:23:44,957 --> 01:23:47,357
And last week it became a reality.

1151
01:23:50,096 --> 01:23:53,554
Congratulations. You did that.

1152
01:23:58,271 --> 01:24:02,708
My teacher, Mr. Parks, would say
that I've been able to find my music.

1153
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:06,142
Now does that mean that
I became a superhero? No, I don't think so.

1154
01:24:06,212 --> 01:24:09,545
Although, I do like to wear spandex
and a cape around the house sometimes.

1155
01:24:11,117 --> 01:24:16,111
The differences that you make
that are the ones of lasting importance,

1156
01:24:17,623 --> 01:24:22,026
they're the little differences that
you make in the life of another person.

1157
01:24:22,095 --> 01:24:25,326
And all of these people
that I got to tell you about tonight,

1158
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:28,265
they all made a difference in my life,

1159
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:31,792
and I can only hope that somehow
I made a difference in theirs.

1160
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:37,810
And that after years and years and years
of trying to become larger than life,

1161
01:24:39,112 --> 01:24:42,206
I'm now working on maybe
being a little smaller.

1162
01:24:46,385 --> 01:24:49,354
Hey, you're late.

1163
01:24:49,922 --> 01:24:51,787
Blow me, Ironsides.

1164
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:57,055
Last one in pays.

1165
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:12,033
All right, easy there, Andretti.

1166
01:25:13,212 --> 01:25:15,339
Come on, cowboy.

1167
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:16,938
Two?
Please.

1168
01:25:17,016 --> 01:25:18,313
Follow me.

1169
01:25:20,153 --> 01:25:21,177
Is this one okay?

1170
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:23,381
Yeah, if you're big tippers.

1171
01:25:24,157 --> 01:25:28,423
He's paying,
but he's a cheap son of a bitch.

1172
01:25:28,494 --> 01:25:32,521
But if you play your cards right,

1173
01:25:32,598 --> 01:25:37,729
you could have a ride on my chair, baby.

1174
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:40,632
He says I'm buying
and I'm a cheap son of a bitch,

1175
01:25:40,706 --> 01:25:44,870
but if you play your cards right,
you can have a ride in his chair.

1176
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:48,072
Honey, only if you promise to go real fast.

1177
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:56,220
No, thank you.
I think we know what we want.

1178
01:25:56,756 --> 01:25:57,848
Yeah.

1179
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:01,089
You got a live one, Honeyman.

1180
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,593
Yeah.

1181
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:06,154
Here you go.

1182
01:26:09,435 --> 01:26:10,595
Thank you.

1183
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,161
Well, that's the slowest service
I've ever seen.

1184
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:15,901
It only took us 20 years to get these.

1185
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:19,137
Be cool.

1186
01:26:19,212 --> 01:26:24,149
You're gonna get us arrested again.

1187
01:26:27,353 --> 01:26:29,617
And I probably wouldn't mind.

1188
01:26:40,766 --> 01:26:42,529
I think he likes it.

1189
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:45,428
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:26:50,476 --> 01:26:53,036
So, I guess this one's mine, huh?

1191
01:26:53,112 --> 01:26:56,377
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1192
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:57,780
You've gotta be kidding me.

1193
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:01,115
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1194
01:27:01,187 --> 01:27:05,453
<i>Happy birthday, dear Richard</i>

1195
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:08,288
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1196
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:14,698
Hey, come on, make a wish.

1197
01:27:19,538 --> 01:27:20,527
Yeah.

1198
01:27:27,914 --> 01:27:30,747
- Hey, Richard.
- Yeah?

1199
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,914
There's something
I have always wanted to ask you.

1200
01:27:36,989 --> 01:27:38,047
What's that?

1201
01:27:38,124 --> 01:27:41,287
Does this wheelchair

1202
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:46,224
make my butt look big?

1203
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,299
I'll see you around, Art.

1204
01:27:49,368 --> 01:27:50,562
Yeah.

1205
01:27:54,006 --> 01:27:56,975
<i>

1206
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:42,747
<i>Everyone pretends</i>

1207
01:28:43,723 --> 01:28:47,284
<i>Why am I knocking on your door?</i>

1208
01:28:49,028 --> 01:28:53,829
<i>It never opened for me before</i>

1209
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:57,928
<i>Up against the glass</i>

1210
01:28:58,004 --> 01:29:00,495
<i>I wonder what it's like</i>

1211
01:29:00,573 --> 01:29:03,872
<i>For ordinary people</i>

1212
01:29:05,978 --> 01:29:08,538
<i>Running through your life</i>

1213
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:10,912
<i>Don't you wanna fly?</i>

1214
01:29:11,384 --> 01:29:14,649

<i>You go the other way</i>

1222
01:29:45,718 --> 01:29:48,278
<i>I thought I heard you say</i>

1223
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:51,881
<i>You wish you'd never come</i>

1224
01:29:54,026 --> 01:29:56,688
<i>Tearing through the time</i>

1225
01:29:56,762 --> 01:30:02,325
<i>Would you try to right</i>

<i>Is everybody lost before they're found?</i>

1233
01:30:40,706 --> 01:30:44,335
