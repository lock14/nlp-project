1
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:14,143
I told you I don't have time to wait.
What is this?

2
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,413
Do you have any idea? What's going on?

3
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,127
I know, honey, I'm on my way, okay?

4
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,895
Hi. I need to check your bag.

5
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,670
Right this way.

6
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,440
Come on, let's go. Get out of the way, now.

7
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:21,847
Hold it!

8
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:26,111
Please take the ticket.

9
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,584
Please take the ticket.

10
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,827
Please take the ticket.

11
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:48,068
Come on! Get in there!

12
00:02:58,153 --> 00:02:59,882
Please insert card.

13
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:03,852
Please insert card.

14
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,192
Please insert card.

15
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,367
Please insert card.

16
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:16,535
I can't follow you guys. You drive too slow.

17
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,434
Bernie. Hey.

18
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,242
- Sad, huh?
- Tragic.

19
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,473
- Poor Jocelyn.
- It's ridiculous.

20
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,242
- Daniel, he was her world.
- Hold up. Cat hair.

21
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:31,150
Oh, that's why I never wear black.
Don't even look in the mirror anymore.

22
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,882
Should've thought of it years ago.

23
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:37,153
We celebrate a very special life

24
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:42,721
as we lay to rest Jocelyn's cherished
companion, Pridey Sahara Morgan.

25
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:04,474
Honey, we have to stay.
She raised him from a puppy.

26
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,953
All I know is that if I'm not back
in the office this afternoon,

27
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,751
Monday is gonna be hell.

28
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,917
She went to every one
of Allegra's birthday parties.

29
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:15,259
Oh, come on. Allegra is our actual child.
Let's get some perspective here.

30
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,264
Do you think if Jocelyn
were married with kids

31
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:20,460
she'd be giving her dog a state funeral?

32
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,469
This whole thing is warped.

33
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,097
- I find that personally offensive, Dad.
- What?

34
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,698
I mean, I may never be married
or be a mother.

35
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:30,006
Yes, some gay women
get some version of that,

36
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,308
but we don't all need the same things.

37
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,406
Can we at least agree that

38
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,677
human beings need

39
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,280
human connection?

40
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:42,585
You know, companionship,
conversation, sex.

41
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:46,560
You get those things from Mom.
Jocelyn gets them from her dogs.

42
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,962
Can I take your car?

43
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,698
Dad had to go.

44
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,202
We can't let Jocelyn sit home and brood.

45
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,546
Maybe we could all take a class.
Learn Portuguese. Go to Brazil.

46
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:12,678
I don't think I could fit
one more thing in my week, honestly.

47
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:16,815
No, no, you're right. You're right.
We should make an effort.

48
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,383
She just lives so far away from everything.

49
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,001
Give it back, Trey.

50
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,697
Come on. Give it back.

51
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:36,037
See ya.

52
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,285
Thanks. Take care.

53
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,082
Hi.

54
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,554
- Trey. Yeah.
- Trey.

55
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,996
Lovers' Guide to Paris.

56
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,557
Food Lovers' Guide.

57
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:02,865
We're gonna go to Paris. My husband and I.

58
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:07,431
It's his first time in Paris. Mine, too.

59
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,443
- It's a business trip for him.
- Really?

60
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,479
They fly him business class.

61
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:16,415
So we're just gonna do an exchange
so that I can tag along.

62
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,282
- That's pretty thrifty.
- Yeah.

63
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:21,379
I've never been to France. I mean...

64
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,716
I've been to Québec. But that's...

65
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,162
- It's not in... It's in... Okay.
- No.

66
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:32,496
Do you want me to help you
carry these to your car?

67
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,397
- No.
- Okay.

68
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:37,802
- Well, have fun.
- Okay.

69
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:39,636
Send me a postcard.

70
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,478
- Hi.
- Hey.

71
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:47,811
Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I stopped to buy us a present.

72
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,044
Oh, yeah. What do you got?

73
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:54,884
- What?
- Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

74
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,856
I thought I said something.

75
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,415
- Yo, jeez, these guys are terrible.
- What?

76
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,223
Been like this all game. This one guy...

77
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,120
Paris is off.

78
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,932
- We're not going to Paris?
- Dale's going.

79
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:12,030
My boss-boss asked me to take the CEO
of Consolidated to the NBA playoffs.

80
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:15,008
I guess the guys at Consolidated
are like basketball freaks.

81
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:17,544
But if it's San Antonio, it'll be over in four.

82
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:21,173
Unless Tim Duncan gets hit
with an asteroid or something.

83
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,247
Anyway, figure I'll be on the road
for like a week, maybe eight days.

84
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,654
Maybe 10, just depending on...

85
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,595
Oh, what if your mom came and stayed?

86
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,023
Ten days with my mother?

87
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,630
Prudie.

88
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,641
What, did you want me
to say no to my boss?

89
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,343
Always doing something wrong, you know?

90
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:01,711
I have no idea what I did.
I genuinely have no idea.

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,798
I was just thinking about
something Allegra said

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,701
at Jocelyn's the other day.

93
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,966
I don't know if it was just
the sadness of the occasion, or...

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,405
- Oh, don't make fun, Daniel.
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

95
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,965
- That was her dog.
- No.

96
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,705
I'm saying it affected me.

97
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,339
- Come on.
- Okay, honey. Whatever you say.

98
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,440
Anyway, so Allegra and I are talking about

99
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,543
how we all need to have

100
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,152
connection, you know?

101
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:38,125
Conversation. Sex.

102
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,061
Companionship.

103
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:46,033
And Allegra says,
"Well, you get all that from Mommy."

104
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,735
I gotta tell you, it really made me sad.

105
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:51,101
Oh, baby, she'll find somebody.

106
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,640
No, it made me sad for us.

107
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,040
See, 'cause I've been struggling

108
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:01,080
with whether a marriage
can sustain all of that

109
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,046
over 20-plus years,

110
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:10,057
or whether it's just inevitable
that after a certain amount of time...

111
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,149
What are you...

112
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,854
Maybe being with someone else can have

113
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,557
a renewing effect, because for me...

114
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,871
I've been seeing a woman at work.

115
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:30,543
We've been together six months now.

116
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,637
We can't think of this as a failure.

117
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,148
We have had a very successful marriage.

118
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:38,879
We've had a long marriage, by any standard.
We've got three wonderful kids.

119
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,182
They're grown, they're working, they're...

120
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:43,747
Just open the car door, Daniel,
I need a tissue.

121
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,993
The kids, that's... That's all you.
You know, you...

122
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,799
You made all the sacrifices with that.
I know.

123
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,673
But there's a logic to us
quitting while we're ahead.

124
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:06,737
And I think that they'll be able to see that.

125
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:10,817
I don't understand a single word
of what you're saying, Daniel.

126
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,375
Who is this woman?

127
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,121
Look, I'm tired of lying to you.

128
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:20,423
I'm tired of making promises to Pam
that I can't keep.

129
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,986
She deserves better. And so do you.

130
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,559
And I won't give her up.
That's non-negotiable.

131
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,206
Syl.

132
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,720
I really like Edmund in this movie.
Have you seen it?

133
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,018
I love this movie.

134
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:53,754
Oh, I like it, but it's not Mansfield Park.

135
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,557
It's more of an interpretation.

136
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,495
- Do you know the book?
- Yes.

137
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,329
And I happen to teach film.

138
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:02,597
- Do you like this movie?
- No.

139
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,834
Do you know it mixes up Fanny Price
with the author of the book?

140
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,842
Makes Sir Bertram
some kind of slave owner.

141
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,434
Well, it means well.

142
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:12,139
And a little Jane Austen's
better than none at all.

143
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,649
No. No. No.
That is how I talk myself into everything.

144
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,985
I'm married to a man

145
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,422
who would cancel our trip to Paris
for a basketball game,

146
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,221
which is making me a fraud
in front of my students.

147
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:29,263
A French teacher
who's never been to France?

148
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,991
The screenplay is outstanding.

149
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:35,025
Excuse me. I'd like to talk to you.
Come with me.

150
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:36,900
You seem to know a lot about Jane Austen.

151
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:38,029
I do.

152
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:41,098
You know, Prudie,
I've been married six times.

153
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,879
You're always happy at first.
It's how you feel at the end that counts.

154
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:49,349
I've been thinking, I'd like to get married
again, maybe just once more.

155
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:54,080
My favorite was Ben Weinberg.
And this is Ben.

156
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:58,681
He produced Fred Astaire movies.
Don't underestimate older men.

157
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,228
We lived in a house in Beverly Hills
that had a little pond

158
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:03,127
and a bridge and goldfish.

159
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,132
That's how I met my friend Jocelyn.

160
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,634
- Carlos.
- My pleasure.

161
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:10,000
Ben was her godfather. Her family's loaded.

162
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,834
Who's Jocelyn again?

163
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:15,401
The one I wanna start the book club for.
Lost her dog?

164
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,640
Eat. So, book club.

165
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:21,443
I can get Jocelyn and maybe Sylvia.

166
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,347
Jocelyn put Sylvia and Daniel together
in high school.

167
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:24,510
They've been together ever since.

168
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:27,953
Though Sylvia's gonna want Daniel
in the book club,

169
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,683
but I think it should be all women.
Don't you?

170
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,249
I mean, men, they pontificate
and no one can get a word in edgewise.

171
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,056
- Well, I think if you...
- And women won't butt in,

172
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,859
but men, they keep monologuing.
Yammer, yammer, yammer.

173
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,399
And we keep listening,
protecting their feelings.

174
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,560
- But if...
- And men don't do book clubs.

175
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,434
Women want to share,
but men, they hoard what they read,

176
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,599
if they crack open a book.

177
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:48,574
Does your husband read?

178
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,873
He reads stuff online.

179
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,081
You know, it's gonna be
like extracting teeth to get Sylvia,

180
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,779
because she has to read so much already.

181
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,378
She works at the state library. But, oh!
Hey, no. Okay.

182
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,151
Now, this is brilliant.

183
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:05,692
We'll only do books we've already read.
Is that inspired?

184
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,955
How do we know what books
all of us have read?

185
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,189
Isn't it obvious?

186
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:14,964
Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice,
Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion.

187
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:16,196
- I'm leaving some...
- Sense and Sensibility.

188
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,431
And Sense and Sensibility.
It's been three years

189
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,372
since I've read Sense and Sensibility.
I have to pee.

190
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,931
When I get back, hot water and lemon.

191
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,409
And we still have to think
of two more people.

192
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:24,467
Six novels, six people.

193
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:26,980
We'll each be responsible for one book.

194
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:29,414
All Jane Austen, all the time!

195
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:30,644
It's the perfect antidote.

196
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,413
- To what?
- To life.

197
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:36,047
I get Pride and Prejudice.

198
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,727
I called the library
and said you had bronchitis.

199
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:46,062
Anne Marie's moving your indigenous
peoples meeting to next week.

200
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,658
I should go in.

201
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:53,239
Pam Gower did her law degree at Bolt,
passed the bar in 2002.

202
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,466
She's an infant.

203
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:59,309
She joined the firm
of Perry, Liebman, Avila in 2006.

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,780
Says here she was divorced in 2005.

205
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,511
Bitch. She went right for Daniel.

206
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:04,882
She's 45.

207
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,814
She's not even young.

208
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,689
- Do you think he has a brain tumor?
- I think he fell in love.

209
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,522
Well, I'm rooting for the brain tumor.

210
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:16,223
People our age don't fall in love.
I mean, I've never even been in love.

211
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:19,789
- You've never been in love?
- I've had sexual partners.

212
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:23,269
I mean, I don't know.
I wouldn't mind falling in love,

213
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,829
but it just all seems
like fiction to me, anyway.

214
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,741
Well, for a fiction,
he just threw 20 years of marriage away

215
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,301
on an impulse.

216
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,044
Do you think he was thinking,
the whole time,

217
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:35,377
"I can't wait to get out of here?"

218
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,112
- Am I really that uninteresting?
- No.

219
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:41,986
- I can't believe I'm alone at this age.
- Mom, you're not alone.

220
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,183
And listen to me.
Alone's not the end of the world.

221
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,820
For as many years as you've been married
I've been quite happily unmarried.

222
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,761
It's just so unfair.

223
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,890
He can start his life over again.
And at this age.

224
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:55,561
You know, men can do that.
Women... It's over.

225
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:57,070
You're beautiful, Mommy.

226
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,504
Yes, and accomplished and interesting.

227
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,474
You're not without your options, Sylvia.

228
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,705
Daniel's the one with options.
He can sleep with anyone.

229
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,271
Twenty-year-olds.
People will say, "Way to go, Daniel."

230
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,950
If I tried to sleep with someone
that age, it'd be pathetic.

231
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,285
Well, yeah, that's 'cause
guys my age are lame.

232
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:18,086
- My body will become a museum.
- No, it won't.

233
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:22,322
We'll get you a membership to my gym.
You might even meet somebody.

234
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,996
I don't wanna meet someone.

235
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,801
I wanna pull the covers over my head
and read novels.

236
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,304
And eat.

237
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,635
I'm starving.

238
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,576
Allegra, mija, go get me a dozen eggs.

239
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:46,083
- I'm gonna make a flan.
- Okay.

240
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,286
Can you stay with her this weekend?

241
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,985
- Actually, I'm moving back in.
- Really?

242
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,260
My lease is almost up and, you know,
I won't let her be here alone.

243
00:15:57,365 --> 00:16:00,163
Oh, sweetie, that's... Thank you.
You're amazing.

244
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,032
See, that's why people have children.

245
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:07,803
My father left my mom when I was 10.
Sylvia was the first person I told.

246
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,968
That's when I knew
we were really best friends.

247
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,035
I'm gonna be at Stockton
at the Breeders' Convention,

248
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:13,171
if you need me, okay?

249
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:35,327
- Are you here for the Buffy conference?
- Oh, no.

250
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,176
Excuse me.

251
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,717
My dog has the same exact collar.

252
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,631
- She was invisible.
- What?

253
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:09,431
It's a game. They're vampires.

254
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:11,563
When you see one of them
with their arms crossed like that,

255
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,731
you should pretend you don't see her.

256
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,298
That's why she didn't answer you.
Nothing personal.

257
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:16,604
Thanks.

258
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:21,343
- My name's Grigg.
- Greg?

259
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,281
Grigg, G-R-l-G-G.

260
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,352
Oh. I'm meeting some people, Grigg.

261
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,518
Okay.

262
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,144
Can I have a whiskey straight up?

263
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,040
Excuse me. Could I apologize? I'm Jocelyn.

264
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,013
Your friend isn't coming?

265
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,413
I'm meeting him a little later.

266
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:34,451
So how do you know so much
about the "faux vampire" scene?

267
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,889
That's funny. Well, it's...

268
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,484
I'm here for a sci-fi conference.

269
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:45,863
So the Buffy contingent is a kind of,
you know, offshoot of that.

270
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,094
Yeah. You read much science fiction?

271
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,502
I'm more of a Jane Austen,
Jane Eyre kind of girl.

272
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:53,631
Oh, right, yeah. No, I never really...

273
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,404
Read those books? Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:18:57,578 --> 00:19:00,308
So, where do you live?

275
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:04,784
I just relocated to the Sacramento area.
I do tech support at U.

276
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,114
You know who you might like?
Ursula Le Guin.

277
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,988
Left Hand of Darkness. Lathe of Heaven.

278
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:15,585
She's science fiction
but she's just a terrific writer.

279
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:17,062
- Have to check her out.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:21,067
My sisters love those books.
I really think you might like them.

281
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,230
And I'm willing to be directed as well.

282
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,503
Seriously, you know,
if you tell me who I should be reading,

283
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,841
I promise to read it.

284
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:34,108
I'll give you my email.

285
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,548
That's the old one.
I'll write those books, too.

286
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,985
You know what I'm actually
wondering before I go?

287
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,489
How do you feel about older women?

288
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:47,693
Great. Yeah.

289
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,990
I have three older sisters, so...

290
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,367
You know, I like all women.

291
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,961
Good. That's great.

292
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:01,804
- Well, thanks. I'll be in touch.
- Oh, okay.

293
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:02,865
Great.

294
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,605
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

295
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,514
Oh, good, Prudie, you're here.

296
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,917
Save these tables, okay?
Oh, Jocelyn, Prudie.

297
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:14,511
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello. Good.

298
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,752
- So what do you want, Prudie?
- A soy cappuccino.

299
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,095
I have to be allowed
to miss one meeting out of the six.

300
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:23,494
I can only do this if there's no pressure.

301
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:26,124
- Hey. Mom's looking for parking.
- Hi.

302
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
That's Prudie. Say hi.

303
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,429
We're still only five. Too bad about Daniel.

304
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:36,966
He could've filled in, although clearly
he's never read Jane Austen.

305
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,036
For Prudie's sake,
the last thing we need is an Austen virgin.

306
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,877
We need real discussion.

307
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,578
I sort of invited someone.
Said he might come, maybe.

308
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,745
- He?
- No one I'm interested in.

309
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:51,923
He's young, compliant,
said he might enjoy being in a book club.

310
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:53,984
I'm sure Daniel's read Jane Austen.

311
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:55,995
No man who reads Austen
would ever dump his wife

312
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:58,293
because it's better for the other woman.

313
00:20:58,366 --> 00:20:59,731
Chai latte with a shot.

314
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm so sorry. I'm really behind.

315
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:05,003
I got slammed with orders on my website.

316
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:08,906
I've actually... I've started adding
these little dangles at the top here.

317
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,036
- What do you think?
- I'm no judge.

318
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,603
I mean, my idea of jewelry

319
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:17,048
is Coco Chanel's Byzantine oeuvre
from the 1920s.

320
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,551
Oh! Definitely. Yeah, I get that.

321
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:25,548
Being the only child of a woman
who gave birth in a commune

322
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:30,586
after changing her name to Sky Girl,
I've come to loathe hippie handicrafts.

323
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,968
There she is.

324
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,397
Actually, I'm not so sure
I wanna do this book club.

325
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:44,205
So, quick, while Sylvia's still in line,
how she's doing without Daniel?

326
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:46,678
She's still stuck in the wounded stage.

327
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:50,410
- When she's ready for anger, I am so there.
- Me, too.

328
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,576
My dad left my mom.

329
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:54,553
Prudie is no stranger
to marital disappointment.

330
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,452
Actually, we're fine now.

331
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,958
You're married? But no ring, huh?

332
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,054
Yeah, it's this hand, and... I teach French.

333
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,597
You teach French, so you wear your
wedding ring on the right hand?

334
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:07,429
- It's a European custom.
- Are you European?

335
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:10,937
So Prudie, you haven't said which book
you wanna be responsible for.

336
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,563
Maybe Persuasion.

337
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,905
'Cause I'm increasingly drawn
to its elegiac tone.

338
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,945
- Don't think I'm doing the book club.
- You're doing it.

339
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,641
You lead one discussion. Pick a book.

340
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:26,249
Well, I just saw Sense and Sensibility,

341
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,949
and I think,
since I'm back living with my mom,

342
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:33,460
I really get that whole two-women,

343
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:37,088
tight-relationship, living-together-
but-really-opposites thing.

344
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,029
Is it weird living back at home again?

345
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,797
I think what Austen is actually writing about
is two sisters,

346
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,237
moving separately toward what
they each believe to be a perfect love.

347
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:50,175
Okay, but the point is
Marianne and Elinor's relationship...

348
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,735
Maybe if you'd read the book
instead of watching the movie...

349
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:55,611
- I thought I might do Emma.
- Which leaves what for Sylvia?

350
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,651
Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.

351
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,909
Which one's gonna make her feel better?

352
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,081
Because we're only doing the book club
to get her mind off Daniel.

353
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:05,421
I thought the reason for the book club
was for my not going to Paris.

354
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,085
- Exactly.
- Northanger Abbey.

355
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,753
No, don't make her do Northanger.

356
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,229
I mean, first you're going off
to all these dances,

357
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:15,564
and then suddenly it's sort of like
Nightmare on Northanger Abbey Street.

358
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm afraid this isn't the book club
that I had in mind.

359
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:21,672
I mean, I find when someone in the group
feels superior to the author,

360
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,437
it just... It sets the wrong tone.

361
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,671
Okay, I'm happy to leave.

362
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:28,181
- No, Allegra. No. Allegra. No.
- Allegra, you can't. You can't.

363
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:30,740
After this day, I am so happy
to be talking about Jane Austen.

364
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,513
- Hi.
- Hi. Did we choose the books yet?

365
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,781
Sylvia, Prudie.

366
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,846
Oh, I'm sorry. Sylvia Avila.

367
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,859
- So, how do you feel about Mansfield Park?
- My favorite.

368
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:42,452
- I love Fanny Price.
- Stop, Mom, why?

369
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,758
She's such a goodie-goodie.

370
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:46,095
Six books, five people.
We skip Northanger Abbey.

371
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,294
- Definitely.
- And miss out on Mr. Tilney?

372
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,769
- No, you're right.
- He's such a flirt.

373
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,430
We don't have to do all six books, do we?

374
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:55,373
Doing all six novels
is the raison d'étre of the book club

375
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:57,809
and it is the only reason I'm here.

376
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:00,608
- Okay.
- Do you wanna invite your husband?

377
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,584
My husband has never read Austen
and he never will.

378
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,652
Okay, how should we do this?

379
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,630
Just meet once a month
at each of our houses, potluck...

380
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:20,132
Or, you know, pick some central location.

381
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,828
No, I don't think a coffee shop's conducive.

382
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,927
I'll host the first one, we'll start with Emma,
at my place.

383
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,437
But let's not get into this
competitive cooking thing.

384
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,734
Bakeoffs!

385
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:28,638
- No, we'll do finger foods.
- We're gonna do takeout.

386
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:31,542
And we have to create
the Jane Austen mood.

387
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,047
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

388
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,342
- He came.
- Yeah.

389
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,749
Sorry, I sat in the wrong Starbucks
for half an hour.

390
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:46,390
Golly, there are a lot of these places, huh?

391
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,022
But they've got interesting coffee
from all over the world, so...

392
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,730
- This is Grigg, everyone.
- I'm Bernadette.

393
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:58,968
- Prudie.
- Prudie, and Allegra.

394
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,700
- Sylvia.
- Grigg Harris.

395
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,035
Hi.

396
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,541
Well, I'm excited.

397
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:11,049
Never read anything by Jane Austen before.

398
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:14,845
What is it?

399
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:17,857
Well, I went to the bookstore
to buy a copy of each one of the novels,

400
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:18,914
and I saw this.

401
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:20,961
And I thought,
"Well, maybe they're all sequels."

402
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,122
So, I figured it might be a good idea
to keep them all together in one book,

403
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,826
in case I needed to refer back.

404
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,960
Is this the order that we read them in?

405
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:32,005
Do you wanna grab a coffee, Grigg?

406
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,564
No, no. No, I'm fine.
I had plenty at the other place.

407
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:39,807
And... I bought this and they filled it up
for me, so I'm a little...

408
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:42,271
Yeah.

409
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:46,080
Oh, you said in your email
there was someone you wanted me to meet?

410
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:50,180
Yeah. Yeah, all of us, actually.

411
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:53,089
I thought we might benefit
from the perspective of a male in the group.

412
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,560
- A little testosterone.
- Right.

413
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:59,497
- Okay. So, none of you ladies are married?
- Prudie.

414
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,598
Right, so we just... What?
We just read them chronologically, and...

415
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:12,612
- We're doing Emma first.
- Emma?

416
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,580
Oh. Starting in the middle, huh?

417
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:17,446
- They're not sequels.
- They're not?

418
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:20,316
Well, great. We just start anywhere.

419
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,182
- What were you smoking?
- He's cute.

420
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,956
I thought he'd be a distraction for Sylvia.

421
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,793
She needs an adventure.
If he becomes a problem I'll get rid of him.

422
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:35,028
- What happened, you pull a DUI?
- No, no, I pretty much bike everywhere.

423
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:36,535
Where do you live?

424
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:40,701
About 20 miles north. Vista Mar.

425
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:44,107
- You live in what, that development?
- Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:47,670
I had this software company
and my accountant says to me,

427
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:48,976
"You gotta buy a house."

428
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:51,108
So, we were right by that exit.

429
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:54,621
And I said, "Pull over."

430
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:57,156
Got out, went in, pointed, bought a house.

431
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:59,385
- Like that.
- I should sell it, I guess.

432
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,327
Or at least buy some furniture.

433
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:04,626
Well, I guess I'll have to,
if you guys are coming over, right?

434
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,061
Allegra.

435
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:09,566
- Bye.
- Yeah. Sayonara.

436
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,039
You know, I never picked a book.

437
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:17,077
Could I do that abbey one?

438
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:19,578
- Perfect. Yeah, it's yours.
- Oh, Northanger Abbey.

439
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,638
Great. All right.

440
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:24,275
- Emma. Starting in the middle.
- Yeah.

441
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,292
Well, you gotta hand it to him
for taking the dud book.

442
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,725
It's the shortest, that's why.

443
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:37,491
- He's eager to please.
- Prudie, see you next time.

444
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:39,896
He is eager to please. He likes women.

445
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:42,936
- A welcome quality in a man.
- Yes. Yes.

446
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:47,667
- Do you think Sylvia responded to him?
- We let him in. It's done.

447
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,936
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

448
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,459
You're up.

449
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:22,171
Go big!

450
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,053
You okay?

451
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:17,588
Hey. Hey, you. Listen.

452
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:20,360
Can you make sure
they don't call my mother? Please.

453
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:23,232
Just make sure they don't call my mother.

454
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:27,269
Mrs. Avila? This is Corinne.

455
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:31,334
- I'm a friend of Allegra's.
- Allegra's.

456
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,107
And she's asked me to call you.

457
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,672
We're up here in Vacaville at a...

458
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,217
- Jewelry show.
...jewelry show.

459
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:43,120
I was showing her how to use my scooter
and she took a little spill.

460
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,590
It's minor. She banged up her wrist.

461
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,390
She doesn't need you to come. It's nothing.
We're at the doctor's.

462
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,931
He says she could be a bit sore.

463
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:57,264
Allegra didn't want you to worry
if she's not home tonight.

464
00:29:58,138 --> 00:30:00,902
I'll remind her. Book club Monday night.

465
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,753
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:28,695
We don't shop on this side of town, ever.

467
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,627
Sorry.

468
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:39,095
You can have this Whole Foods.
We won't ever use it again. Okay?

469
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:54,220
So I was getting the wine for book club
and I bumped into Daniel.

470
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,312
He was with her.

471
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,879
- Oh, sweetie.
- Yeah.

472
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,482
They were going home to make dinner.

473
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:02,587
He was wearing a jacket with a zipper.

474
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:05,223
- No.
- That's so not Daniel.

475
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:11,193
I just... I walk around this house,
and it's not my home anymore.

476
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:14,399
I feel like Fanny Price
banished from Mansfield Park.

477
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,740
- That woman is living my life.
- Honey, she can't live your life.

478
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,643
Are you all right?

479
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:25,174
I know you like being alone,
but don't you ever get Ionely?

480
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,290
So what'd you think about Grigg?

481
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:36,357
The book club guy.

482
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:38,462
If you like him, I like him.

483
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:42,195
- How about those dreamy eyes?
- I didn't really notice.

484
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:43,463
Well, notice.

485
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:46,529
Can you come early tomorrow
since you're bringing the wine?

486
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:50,064
That's my girls. That's my girls.
That's my girls.

487
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,645
It's a smallish world, pedigreed Ridgebacks.

488
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:56,308
- "Pedigreed" is...
- Well, it's breeding.

489
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:58,943
Certain bloodlines
are naturally more valuable.

490
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:03,285
Mine are out of Queenie of the Serengeti.
Gorgeous hound. Gone now.

491
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:07,886
I bred her to my first
really important sire, Pridey.

492
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:12,159
Sire's the boy dog. Great disposition.
Passed away last month.

493
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:14,223
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

494
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:17,737
Miss him. But Queenie was the real star.

495
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:22,002
Ridgebacks are matriarchal.
That's one of their attractive features.

496
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,737
Hey, hey, hey! Sahara, off!

497
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,802
Sorry. Sorry about that.

498
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:31,442
Sahara I had to have spayed.
Thyroid issues.

499
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:36,148
I still show her, though.
She's very competitive in her category.

500
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,192
- Yeah?
- Sexually altered bitch.

501
00:33:43,764 --> 00:33:45,163
Well, I got you those books.

502
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,224
You know the ones I suggested?
Ursula Le Guin.

503
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:51,862
Oh, yeah. Thanks, that was thoughtful.

504
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,041
You don't have to bring a hostess gift
to these meetings, FYI.

505
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,974
It's just a book club.

506
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,944
Where's the heat
between Emma and Mr. Knightley?

507
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,745
There's no animal passion.

508
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:07,286
Look at Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax.

509
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,016
You can tell they're really in love
because they behave so badly.

510
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,079
And that's good?

511
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:16,425
Emma and Mr. Knightley,
you just never feel the sex.

512
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,089
Still, I think Mr. Knightley's very yummy.
Don't you?

513
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:23,068
He may be my favorite of all the Austen men.

514
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:25,468
Sans passion I'amour n'est rien.

515
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,903
- That's not Jane's theme, is it?
- Jane?

516
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,442
That's cozy.

517
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:35,976
What we're meant to see
is not the lack of passion

518
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:39,280
so much as the control of it,
and the not giving in.

519
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,183
Après moi, le deluge.

520
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:45,491
But Prudie's right, it is in all the novels.

521
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:47,719
Sense and Sensibility, obviously.

522
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,558
Oh, and then there's Maria's infidelity
in Mansfield Park.

523
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,860
I forgot there's infidelity in Mansfield Park.

524
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,457
Austen's all about keeping it zipped.

525
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:59,164
Yeah, but isn't physical attraction
one of the ungovernable forces?

526
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,106
You know, like gravity.
That's what we like about it.

527
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:07,238
You know, downhill, release the brakes,
loosen your grip, and...

528
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,544
Yeah. Love makes people crazy.

529
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,777
- It does not excuse bad behavior.
- I agree.

530
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:16,812
And Mr. Knightley is violently in love.
"Violently!" His word.

531
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,949
And yet, he's never anything
but a gentleman.

532
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,721
- Yeah, a gentleman who scolds people.
- Not everyone.

533
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:24,423
You know, just Emma,
just the woman that he loves.

534
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,728
C'est vrai. C'est typique.

535
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,098
A man can do whatever he likes
to the woman he loves.

536
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,034
I don't think that's what Austen's saying.

537
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,267
Actually, Emma stops being crazy
when she falls for Mr. Knightley.

538
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,071
It's the event of the book.
Love is an act of sanity.

539
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:40,602
One thing that I noticed about Emma
is the sense of menace.

540
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,548
The gypsies,
Jane Fairfax's boating accident,

541
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:45,710
Mr. Woodhouse's worries.

542
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:49,448
Austen's entire thesis is that
none of these things are real, Grigg.

543
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:53,983
I mean, Emma, she acts
on the basis of her fantasies.

544
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,620
Yes, Grigg, I'm afraid
you've just entirely missed the point.

545
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,425
You know, I've read that the Emma plot,

546
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:02,127
the humbling of the pretty, know-it-all girl
is the most popular plot of all time.

547
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,329
Yes, universally satisfying.

548
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:08,233
Okay. Well, what bothered me

549
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:11,505
was how Emma kept forcing
her friend Harriet on Mr. Elton.

550
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,239
And then she finds out
who Harriet's father is,

551
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,372
and suddenly, "Ew!"
She's lucky to get the farmer.

552
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:18,815
I think Jane was being ironic there.
I think some readers might miss that.

553
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,716
- Emma's a snob.
- Please.

554
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:24,223
People are instinctively drawn to partners
who are their near equal in looks.

555
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,124
The pretty marry the pretty,
the ugly the ugly.

556
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:29,560
To the detriment of the breed,
in my opinion.

557
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:32,655
God, you're such an Emma. Isn't she?

558
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:35,792
You'd love to pair up the whole world,
from dogs to people.

559
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,064
Put me together with Daniel.

560
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,806
And you had beautiful children.

561
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,342
Oh, no, don't get up, Jocelyn.
I'll get the tea. Sorry.

562
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:55,682
Mom.

563
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,072
I hope we didn't scare Grigg away.

564
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:24,344
- Yeah, he sure got out of here fast.
- Yeah, we'll toughen him up.

565
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,884
Was the book club a bad idea?

566
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,820
Austen has a way of making you forget
that most marriages end in divorce.

567
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,050
Well, she's all about the weddings, Jane.

568
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,990
Yeah, "Jane." Did you catch that?

569
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,359
Oh, Prudie?
"Jane and I, we know our themes."

570
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,762
And why did she have to speak in French?

571
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,826
And if so, couldn't she do it in France,
where it's less noticeable?

572
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:47,634
I feel for Prudie.
She's married to a complete Neanderthal.

573
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:53,473
Okay, I will call you when I land in Dallas.
You know what?

574
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:56,037
Let me call you when I check in the hotel
if there's time before the game,

575
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:58,209
- 'cause we're gonna wanna get there early.
- Whatever, okay.

576
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:00,048
Have fun with your mom.

577
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,815
- Hey, Sky. Hi.
- Hi.

578
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,220
Mom, you were supposed
to sit with the car.

579
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,622
I'm gonna get a ticket!

580
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:07,557
- Yo!
- Get some ass!

581
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:10,887
So... Hey, what're we doing today?

582
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,194
Well, I'm teaching. It's a school day, okay?

583
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:14,290
So I'm gonna drop you at the house.

584
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:16,733
Or you can take the car
and you can go see a movie or something.

585
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:19,169
- No, no, I'll hang with you.
- No, no, you can't.

586
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,070
They don't allow that.

587
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:23,871
Mom, could you... Oh, my God, please.

588
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:26,910
Okay, I can't.

589
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,348
Mom, I'm late. Please. Come on.

590
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,317
Oh, ditch them. Blow them off.

591
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:36,617
Tell them your mother doesn't wanna
hang around while you go to work.

592
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,393
What's the story with the clothes?
You dress like a flight attendant.

593
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:47,126
No, I dress like a teacher.
Or it gets confusing.

594
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,169
Mom, mind your stupid... For everyone.

595
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,431
Why would anyone
wanna teach high school?

596
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:53,972
I hated my teachers.

597
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,270
Well, I'm just gonna settle you at the house.

598
00:38:56,343 --> 00:39:00,109
No, I'll drop you at school
and then I'll take the car.

599
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,341
- Should you be driving?
- Huh?

600
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,280
Okay, you know what?
Just don't forget to come get me at 3:00.

601
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,118
Okay? Don't forget.

602
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,292
I'm in Brigadoon.
Would you mind running lines with me?

603
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:26,931
"Of course I'm all right."

604
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,201
"I'd have died
if anything had happened to you.

605
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:31,266
"I love you so."

606
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:33,312
"But how can you be sure in just one day?"

607
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,642
"I dinna know, 'tis just

608
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:38,548
"when a lass falls in and out of love,
she knows it right away."

609
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,750
- What?
- It's a good accent.

610
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:44,915
Well, languages are my speciality.
I just thought that...

611
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,754
French teacher.

612
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:51,828
It's your line.

613
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:53,991
"Do you think you're in love with me?"

614
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,864
"Think? What good does thinking do?

615
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,835
"But what I feel is something else."

616
00:39:57,904 --> 00:40:00,134
"What do ye feel then, Tommy?"

617
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,470
And then we kiss.

618
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:07,875
Who plays opposite you?

619
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,749
Karen Bhave.

620
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:17,316
I think she only tried out because
she thought we'd hook up during the play.

621
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:25,924
I saw you watching me in the library.

622
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,059
- I wasn't watching.
- You were watching.

623
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,796
No, I was reading.

624
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:34,267
- You were watching.
- I was reading this...

625
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,601
- I was reading this book...
- Oh, yeah?

626
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:40,441
...about some people
in this house called Mansfield Park.

627
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:41,605
- Austen.
- Yeah.

628
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:45,344
We're doing Mansfield Park
for senior seminar, so...

629
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:49,821
I actually bought the book already.
I'm trying to make myself wait, you know?

630
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:55,387
Delay gratification. That sort of thing.

631
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:01,699
- So what happens?
- Right, well...

632
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:04,362
Well, they decide to put on a play
in the house.

633
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:08,203
And rehearsing it, it sort of unleashes them.

634
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:11,072
Two of them actually fall in love, and one...

635
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:14,477
One of them, Maria Bertram, is set... Stop it.

636
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:17,038
- Is set to marry someone else.
- Or maybe not.

637
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:19,107
Well, I think... I think...

638
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,178
I think what Austen is trying to say
is that play-acting is dangerous.

639
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:27,556
All of that intimacy backstage,
the waiting and the whispering,

640
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:33,224
and onstage you're gazing at each other,
and "I love you."

641
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,630
I mean...

642
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,730
Well, you can see how it happens.

643
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:41,535
Yeah, I can see it happening,
just not with Karen Bhave.

644
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:45,343
So, do you wanna go over it again?

645
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:14,667
Hello?

646
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:23,983
- Yeah.
- Hey, Grigg, it's Jocelyn.

647
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,608
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

648
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:29,716
- So how's Mansfield Park coming?
- Just great.

649
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:31,154
Am I disturbing you?

650
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:35,456
I'm just writing an email to my sisters
about you, as a matter of fact.

651
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:37,052
And Ursula Le Guin.

652
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,031
- Did you ever read Left Hand of Darkness?
- Not yet.

653
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:41,623
Hey, listen, Bernadette and I
were just saying

654
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,761
we hope Allegra didn't
scare you off the book club.

655
00:42:44,837 --> 00:42:47,169
- Which one is Allegra?
- Sylvia's daughter.

656
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,606
Really pretty, really passionate,
wonderful girl.

657
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:51,803
Ask him if he can make time today.

658
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,675
You might take Sylvia to lunch today.

659
00:42:53,746 --> 00:42:56,943
Tell him that Sylvia and Daniel are
in court this morning over their separation.

660
00:42:57,016 --> 00:42:58,677
She could use the ego boost.

661
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:01,151
You have Sylvia's number, right?

662
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,957
Would you wanna come, too?

663
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,220
Listen, I know
there's a difference in your ages,

664
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,888
but I really think
the two of you will hit it off.

665
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,831
Sahara. I gotta go, okay?

666
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:24,042
This woman I like
definitely seems interested, but it's weird.

667
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,877
She's sort of pushing me to date this girl,
Allegra, who's way younger than me.

668
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:36,184
She said I should
take this girl's mother to lunch.

669
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,686
Bank assets will be divided equally.

670
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,090
Each individual will keep his or her own car,

671
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:52,729
and each will be wholly responsible
for the attendant payments and insurance.

672
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:56,605
The house owned by Daniel and Sylvia
will be jointly held,

673
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:01,704
with both parties paying an equal share of
property taxes, upkeep and repairs.

674
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,909
Sylvia may live in the house. Daniel will not.

675
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:24,793
As soon as Daniel hit 50, his wheels fell off.

676
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,395
Here's what I get from Mansfield Park.

677
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:29,635
That a marriage is only as strong
as its weakest partner.

678
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,769
Daniel has always wanted
to find his center by wobbling.

679
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:34,403
This is a pretty big wobble.

680
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,107
Mansfield Park is full of wobblers.

681
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:40,642
Lady Bertram lying around,
letting a houseful of adolescents run riot.

682
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,347
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.

683
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:45,152
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months,
dumps her husband...

684
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,818
And don't forget Fanny's father,
the unemployed alcoholic.

685
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,260
Marry the weak link and you're screwed.
That's what she's saying.

686
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,423
No wonder why Austen never married.
It's terrifying.

687
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:57,302
- I think I finally hate him.
- Good.

688
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:03,603
I'm home. I'm going out again.
I have book club.

689
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:22,192
You just missed this guy

690
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:28,757
who got buried up to his neck
in a tank filled with cockroaches.

691
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,700
And they were real.

692
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:35,238
You'd think it'd be illegal
to show stuff like that.

693
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:37,071
Here, grab a spoon.

694
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:41,708
You have to leave.

695
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,314
You put your things in your suitcase
'cause I'm booking your flight.

696
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,231
- Want me to...
- Yeah.

697
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,561
- How did you break it?
- I fell.

698
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,901
Which was kind of lucky, actually.

699
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:12,138
'Cause I met this girl, Corinne,
who I've been seeing. She's a writer.

700
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,200
Which, um,

701
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:16,172
isn't so great, really,

702
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:18,774
'cause if she had to choose
between me and writing,

703
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:21,581
she'd probably choose writing.

704
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,680
But she doesn't ever have to choose.
So you never have to know.

705
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:28,158
So you're a lesbian. Full-time?

706
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:32,860
You mean, do I ever slip
and accidentally sleep with a man?

707
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:36,732
No, no, my sister Cat,
she goes out with guys and girls.

708
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:38,100
She lives in Idaho.

709
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,662
Your sister isn't Cat Harris.

710
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,708
- You know her?
- Bernadette knows everyone.

711
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:47,439
I met her through my doctor friend
in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.

712
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,413
You know my sister, Bianca?

713
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,609
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.

714
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,551
Those are your sisters!

715
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,986
Our world is an English village.

716
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:02,689
My topic is the long-suffering daughter.

717
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:05,322
One can't help but see the parallels

718
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:08,424
between the long-suffering
Fanny Price in Mansfield Park

719
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,867
and the long-suffering Anne Eliot
in Persuasion.

720
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:12,404
I hate Fanny Price.

721
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:16,066
Excuse me, we're not electing
the homecoming queen, okay?

722
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:18,804
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes,

723
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,574
we all know Elizabeth Bennet
would be most popular

724
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:23,239
and that Fanny would be least.

725
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,376
- Who's Elizabeth Bennet?
- Of Pride and Prejudice.

726
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:30,153
Don't give away too much,
'cause I haven't read that one yet.

727
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,987
- You don't know Pride and Prejudice?
- No.

728
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,960
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price
was Austen's favorite.

729
00:47:36,028 --> 00:47:38,292
- Fanny's boring.
- She's faithful.

730
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:41,162
She's Horton Hatches the Egg.

731
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,828
She sits on that nest
and she never, ever wavers.

732
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,167
Well, she'd probably be easier to like

733
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,400
if she would just
allow some weakness in others.

734
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:50,499
- She doesn't allow it in herself.
- True.

735
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,841
I didn't see what was so bad
about Henry Crawford.

736
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,677
Yes. Thank you, Grigg.
Why does it have to be Edmund?

737
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:00,014
Well, Austen, she's always suspicious
of people who are too charming.

738
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,782
Just once I'd like to pick up Mansfield Park

739
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:06,154
and see Fanny end up in the sack
with Henry Crawford.

740
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,214
Yes! Yes!

741
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:09,055
You can't read these novels
without wondering

742
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:10,993
if she doesn't have a little thing
for the naughty boys.

743
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:12,360
Well, who doesn't?

744
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,399
Except for Fanny Price.

745
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:18,631
Okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.

746
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:21,298
- She puts her family's needs above her own.
- Mom, it's okay.

747
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:24,241
And she never, ever
stops loving Edmund, ever.

748
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,778
Even when he's stupid enough
to do something like

749
00:48:26,846 --> 00:48:29,041
take up with Mary Crawford.

750
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:37,889
Oh, dear.

751
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:41,458
I thought Mansfield Park would be safe,
didn't you?

752
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,757
I don't think we're gonna get through
all six books.

753
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,390
Reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.

754
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:51,101
You're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?

755
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:53,363
Yeah.

756
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:08,345
Yeah. Yes!

757
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:11,413
The relationship
between Edmund and Fanny.

758
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,924
They seemed like brother and sister.

759
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:17,622
But then in the end,
it's like The Empire Strikes Back,

760
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:23,397
but it's in reverse. You know?
'Cause in Jedi, Luke Skywalker,

761
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:26,632
he gets over Princess Leia
when she turns out to be his sister.

762
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:31,905
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it
on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...

763
00:49:39,752 --> 00:49:41,845
Did that bother anybody else?

764
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:44,981
- Weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch?
- Oh, yeah.

765
00:49:45,057 --> 00:49:47,958
- You know Allegra's gay, right?
- Of course.

766
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,796
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.

767
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,628
And before we do Northanger Abbey,
I gotta buy a couch, so...

768
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,498
- Is something going on between these two?
- Grigg, you have to...

769
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,936
Would you come with me,
help me pick it out?

770
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:02,338
If you take Sylvia to lunch.

771
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,705
Great.

772
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,110
Good, that's great.

773
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,244
- Okay, see you.
- All right, yup, here.

774
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:14,411
- Take care.
- Oh, God. Sorry.

775
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:17,445
I caught him staring at my titties.

776
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:21,224
I like that.

777
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:30,298
- I like this.
- That color's difficult.

778
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:35,198
I like things that are difficult. I'll take it.

779
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,374
Wait, you just don't buy
the first one you like.

780
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:42,209
- You don't even know if it'll fit.
- What? It's fine.

781
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:44,078
You getting hungry?

782
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:49,877
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude,
but may I ask,

783
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,349
do you have a lot of money?

784
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:55,190
Never know how to answer that.

785
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah, I have enough money.

786
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,022
But, you know,
I like working in tech support.

787
00:51:02,134 --> 00:51:03,601
- May I?
- Sure.

788
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,568
You should bring Sylvia here.
It's so romantic.

789
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,732
You know, she's planning
this library fundraiser.

790
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:10,673
- She's busy.
- Call her.

791
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,175
It's hard to be alone.

792
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:18,980
- Well, maybe her husband will come back.
- Maybe.

793
00:51:19,051 --> 00:51:21,212
Jane Austen should write that.

794
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,482
She did. In Persuasion.

795
00:51:23,556 --> 00:51:27,219
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy
Wentworth who's in the navy, right?

796
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,261
But her family thinks that
he's not good enough.

797
00:51:29,328 --> 00:51:30,659
- Right.
- So he leaves.

798
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:32,560
And when he comes back
he's become this wealthy man.

799
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,624
- But he's no longer in love with her.
- Okay. Don't tell me any more.

800
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:42,072
- Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see.
- Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?

801
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:47,469
- You didn't like Le Guin?
- I didn't read them.

802
00:51:47,913 --> 00:51:49,904
How are you gonna know what you like
unless you try?

803
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,313
I think at my age I should know what I like.

804
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:52,509
Age? Come on, age.

805
00:51:52,585 --> 00:51:53,916
Age has nothing to do with anything.

806
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,183
I was willing to read girly books
like Jane Austen...

807
00:51:57,256 --> 00:51:58,280
She is not girly.

808
00:51:58,357 --> 00:51:59,949
Which I found out.

809
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:02,892
So maybe you would find out
that science fiction's not just...

810
00:52:02,962 --> 00:52:05,294
- Aliens on rocket ships.
- Right.

811
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,796
All right, hurry up and finish.
I'm gonna show you something really cool.

812
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,338
What you have to understand
is that when I was a kid,

813
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:17,364
my dad and I
were basically surrounded by girls 24l7.

814
00:52:17,443 --> 00:52:20,310
You know, there was my mom,
my sisters, and their friends.

815
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:23,381
So there'd be like 15 girls in the house.
It was insane.

816
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:27,112
My dad would hide out in the shed
and no one was allowed back there.

817
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:31,418
And he'd listen to ballgame,
you know, smoke his pipe.

818
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:34,754
He actually died a couple years ago
of mouth cancer.

819
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:38,354
- I'm so sorry.
- Anyway, one day...

820
00:52:38,497 --> 00:52:40,931
I'm like 10 years old,
my dad takes me back to the shed

821
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,494
and he shows me some magazines
that he keeps back there.

822
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:49,904
He says, "This is strictly guy stuff.
It's top secret. Very private.

823
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:51,567
"Tell no one."

824
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,381
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...

825
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:03,182
I don't know...
It's like me and my dad and science fiction.

826
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:06,654
These were like the first books
that I fell in love with,

827
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,693
and I never got over it.

828
00:53:09,995 --> 00:53:12,828
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.

829
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,731
Theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.

830
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:21,972
Philip K. Dick.
This was my top-secret all-guy world.

831
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,605
- Andre Norton.
- Very manly.

832
00:53:27,146 --> 00:53:30,707
Except, as it turns out,
Andrew Norton, a.k.a. Andre Norton,

833
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:34,480
- a.k.a. Alice Mary Norton.
- No way.

834
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:36,282
- James Tiptree, Jr.
- I heard of him.

835
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:40,291
Real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.

836
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:43,260
- Patrice Anne...
- You were still surrounded.

837
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,328
But by that time I liked girls.

838
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:00,372
You win. I'll read the Le Guin.

839
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,009
Great.

840
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,625
- Tell me a secret.
- Your turn.

841
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:25,228
No. You have better secrets.
You can trust me.

842
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:30,873
Tell me.

843
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:36,544
Okay, but this is not something
I would tell anyone else.

844
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,951
There was this special needs kid
in the grade above me, Benny.

845
00:54:42,388 --> 00:54:46,484
He wore his hat squashed down
really low, and his ears stuck out.

846
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:49,118
And he was always carrying around
this basketball and going...

847
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:55,624
And, one day, I was in fourth grade,

848
00:54:56,235 --> 00:55:00,433
I saw that he was holding his penis.

849
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:03,030
So, I just went back to my friends.

850
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:06,174
Well, later my dad picked me up.

851
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:09,214
And he was distracted,
just not really listening, and...

852
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:11,044
And I don't know why, but...

853
00:55:11,116 --> 00:55:15,678
I said, "Dad, this boy at school
made me look at his penis."

854
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:18,222
- Wait. What was his name?
- Benny.

855
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,053
We actually got their address
and drove to their house.

856
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:27,531
And Benny's mom answers the door.
I mean, she was old.

857
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:32,200
She has these two long, skinny gray braids.
And my dad's yelling.

858
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:37,369
And she starts crying.
"I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?"

859
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,242
And he says,
"I expect you to speak to your son."

860
00:55:43,816 --> 00:55:48,150
And then right behind her is Benny
with his stupid basketball, going...

861
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:55,058
And my dad just stops.

862
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,222
'Cause he had a little brother like that
who died.

863
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,001
Oh, my God.

864
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:08,733
So we get back in the car
and my dad is just silent.

865
00:56:12,044 --> 00:56:16,743
And then he says, "I think you knew

866
00:56:17,783 --> 00:56:20,946
"you were leaving out
the most important part."

867
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:25,383
And I just felt horrible.

868
00:56:26,325 --> 00:56:30,318
You know, I didn't really know
any of that was gonna happen.

869
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,097
I just wanted his attention.

870
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,351
Have you lost your mind?

871
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,254
I thought about... I thought about calling.

872
00:56:58,323 --> 00:57:03,022
- I... But I didn't wanna wake you.
- You can't just show up here, Daniel.

873
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:04,562
Somebody's gotta mow the lawn.
I don't mind.

874
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,461
Well, I'll pay somebody.

875
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:12,368
You know? I mean, this is my home.
You cannot just arrive here without asking.

876
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:15,062
What if I had somebody staying over?

877
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,906
- Are you seeing someone?
- Put the mower away.

878
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,741
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.

879
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,784
I just missed hearing what's going on here.

880
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:32,216
Allegra, she acts like she hates me,
and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy,

881
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,555
they call from school,
but they don't say much.

882
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:36,958
They're ashamed of their father.

883
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:43,932
So Diego says you told him
the handle on the shower's loose?

884
00:57:45,871 --> 00:57:48,271
- Thirty seconds.
- I'll deal with it.

885
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:50,768
Is there something in the house
you don't want me to see?

886
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,037
Do you think
I'm not taking care of the house?

887
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,806
- No, no...
- You wanna do what a husband does?

888
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,677
You wanna fix things?

889
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:59,179
You can't fix this.

890
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:01,985
You're not my husband.

891
00:58:03,155 --> 00:58:06,989
- All that's gone now.
- Can I call you next weekend?

892
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:09,994
- No, you cannot call me next weekend.
- Okay.

893
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,193
I'll check in with you, okay?

894
00:58:42,027 --> 00:58:44,655
My mom said I could buy a motorcycle
if I paid for it myself.

895
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,563
It's her one stipulation, right?

896
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,225
So I work at the mall.

897
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:52,099
And I have that whole Kerouac thing
planned for this summer,

898
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,161
and now it's, "No."

899
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:58,264
I'm 18 years old.
I have the right to buy a motorcycle.

900
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:01,377
But you had a motorcycle once.

901
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:03,380
And you ended up hating it.

902
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:04,915
Remember, Trey?

903
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,319
Remember? You used to park it
on the other side of the gym.

904
00:59:08,387 --> 00:59:10,287
It was red and black. And...

905
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:13,549
You got really tired of taking care of it.

906
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,115
What're you talking about?

907
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:19,323
That was my mom's technique
when I wanted something.

908
00:59:19,398 --> 00:59:23,266
She'd say, "But you had
a birthday party last year.

909
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,499
"Remember? We had a big cake

910
00:59:27,339 --> 00:59:30,968
"with pink icing and roses all over it.

911
00:59:31,143 --> 00:59:32,667
"And you hated it."

912
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:36,612
And she was totally messing with you?

913
00:59:36,682 --> 00:59:38,013
- It got her out of giving me a birthday party.
- Wow.

914
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,314
I mean, I have wonderful memories of

915
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:48,587
balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.

916
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:56,291
And it never happened.
That's pretty messed up.

917
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:03,401
"We certainly can't have a big party
like that every year, can we?"

918
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,780
So, when did you finally figure it out?

919
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:14,215
Well, by then she had this other trick.

920
01:00:17,923 --> 01:00:22,587
So suggest something to me.
Something you'd like to do.

921
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,356
Okay. Um...

922
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,494
Let's get a room.

923
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:33,567
Let's not get a room and just say we did.

924
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:36,365
Then we give up?

925
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:43,614
You weren't a very persistent kid, were you?

926
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,173
- Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me.
- Why?

927
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,242
Because you're a teacher?

928
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,463
I... We can't do this.

929
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:11,706
Let's get out of here.

930
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:15,245
We'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.

931
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:17,611
Let's not and just wish we did.

932
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:22,317
I don't wanna pretend.

933
01:01:30,128 --> 01:01:31,652
Um, we're late.

934
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,032
Just give me a second.

935
01:01:39,271 --> 01:01:40,363
God.

936
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:16,870
- Does this place seem creepy?
- It's quiet.

937
01:02:19,544 --> 01:02:21,842
- Wow, Sylvia, you look great!
- Hottie!

938
01:02:21,913 --> 01:02:24,006
It's the new me.

939
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:26,448
- Hey, how's Corinne doing?
- Great.

940
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:29,612
So, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights
on Northanger Abbey?

941
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:31,121
Stop it. He might surprise you.

942
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:34,181
- I hope his couch has arrived.
- Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.

943
01:02:34,259 --> 01:02:37,490
- Passing around cans of aerosol cheese?
- Stop it. Fine.

944
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:40,861
Grigg is a grownup.
I'm sure he's made it very nice.

945
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:42,900
All right.

946
01:02:44,035 --> 01:02:46,503
Welcome. Please come in.

947
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:50,200
- Whoa.
- Grigg? Whoa!

948
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:53,038
Apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.

949
01:02:57,215 --> 01:03:01,584
- No, it's Northanger Abbey! It's Gothic!
- Right!

950
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:09,653
No one gets out alive!

951
01:03:10,796 --> 01:03:13,492
- I don't like this. I don't like this.
- Sylvia, Sylvia!

952
01:03:13,565 --> 01:03:16,363
- Grigg? Grigg? Grigg?
- Sylvia, it's a joke.

953
01:03:18,603 --> 01:03:20,503
- He's just having fun...
- Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!

954
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:23,006
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

955
01:03:23,074 --> 01:03:26,908
- Look.
- It's a send-up of Northanger.

956
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,911
- It's a program.
- Bernadette, that's your phone.

957
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:34,179
This is my remote.
And everything's on sensors.

958
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:38,120
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean.
Is Prudie running late?

959
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,658
- What do you do on Hallowe'en?
- Oh, Hallowe'en is big.

960
01:03:40,725 --> 01:03:43,523
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger.
You should come over for Hallowe'en.

961
01:03:43,595 --> 01:03:45,256
- Wait.
- Oh, that's terrible.

962
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,628
I got inspired reading
The Mysteries of Udolpho.

963
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,362
You know, the book in Northanger Abbey
that Catherine's obsessed with reading?

964
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:53,336
- You read The Mysteries of Udolpho?
- Food!

965
01:03:53,405 --> 01:03:56,602
- Hey, Grigg, that color almost works.
- When did you...

966
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:58,836
- He read The Mysteries of Udolpho.
- Wow.

967
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,708
Wait, that book they were reading
in the book? That's a real book?

968
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,374
Yeah, with the black veils
and Laurentina's skeleton.

969
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:08,317
- Didn't you think that sounded great?
- Yeah, it sounded awesome.

970
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,378
Dean, I'm so sorry.
Prudie must be devastated.

971
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,750
Prudie said to ask you.

972
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:15,452
She's supposed to talk or something,
about some book?

973
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:16,892
Persuasion.

974
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:20,590
We don't know how long we're gonna be
down in San Diego, so...

975
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:21,825
She may have to cancel.

976
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,834
Tell her we'll save Persuasion for the end.

977
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:27,167
It's better to do it last, anyway.
It was Austen's final book.

978
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,332
I thought Northanger Abbey was
the final book.

979
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,171
- Written first. Published last.
- That makes much more sense.

980
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,109
- Why?
- What happened with her?

981
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:35,806
'Cause it's a novel about novels.

982
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:40,045
You know? You see Austen as
the young writer, questioning herself.

983
01:04:40,118 --> 01:04:43,212
"Who's a heroine?
What makes a good story?

984
01:04:43,288 --> 01:04:46,485
"Are novels a waste of time? Am I
gonna write? What should I write about?"

985
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:49,959
- I like that.
- That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.

986
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:51,722
Thanks.

987
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:54,062
Prudie's mother died.

988
01:04:54,132 --> 01:04:55,599
- What?
- Jesus.

989
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:01,063
She got into her car yesterday,
this was in San Diego.

990
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:06,104
She made a left coming out of a parking lot
into oncoming traffic.

991
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:07,838
- Jesus.
- Terrible.

992
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:11,437
- Were Prudie and her mom close?
- Well, there was tension.

993
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,784
What do we think? Is Persuasion
too depressing to take on right now,

994
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:21,587
with the dead mother and everything?

995
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,594
She doesn't die on the page.

996
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:26,460
Even Sense and Sensibility, the dad dies.

997
01:05:26,731 --> 01:05:28,096
What about Pride and Prejudice?

998
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:32,762
I could use a little encounter in the woods
with Mr. Darcy right now.

999
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:35,362
- Are we all up for a little romance?
- Ready.

1000
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,103
I think we're all overdue.
And it'll be better for Prudie.

1001
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:44,175
I still can't believe you read
The Mysteries of Udolpho, Grigg.

1002
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:47,912
- Bravo, Grigg. Bravo.
- Yay for the grilled artichokes.

1003
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:52,286
- You can move in with us any time, Grigg.
- Please, don't bring skeletons.

1004
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:55,052
She loves these.

1005
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,019
Are you and Grigg seeing each other?

1006
01:05:59,097 --> 01:06:03,625
No. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously.
That was the plan, right?

1007
01:06:33,264 --> 01:06:34,288
I don't wanna fight, okay?

1008
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,630
I don't know why you didn't
just take her back to the car

1009
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,068
and have sex with her.
I mean, clearly you wanted to.

1010
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:43,836
I talked to her...
I talked to her for like five minutes.

1011
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:45,671
Longer. Longer, Dean.

1012
01:06:45,744 --> 01:06:49,737
And with those ridiculous plastic boobs.
Is that what you go for?

1013
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,878
Prudie, you know,
I was just trying to be nice to your friend.

1014
01:06:54,953 --> 01:06:58,047
Okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.

1015
01:06:58,123 --> 01:07:03,060
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral
to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead."

1016
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:04,527
And you hit on her!

1017
01:07:04,596 --> 01:07:06,496
- I do... I do...
- You hit on her!

1018
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,759
I was not hitting on her.

1019
01:07:24,149 --> 01:07:26,743
You know, when I was in the 10th grade,

1020
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:31,414
I wrote an entire paper on Julius Caesar
in iambic pentameter.

1021
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:37,894
And Chloe Baher removed it from my locker
and she read it aloud to the whole class.

1022
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:41,290
And everyone laughed at me.

1023
01:07:43,468 --> 01:07:45,459
Baby, high school's over.

1024
01:07:46,638 --> 01:07:48,629
High school's never over.

1025
01:07:58,883 --> 01:08:01,784
"And turning 'round,
he looked for a moment at Elizabeth

1026
01:08:01,853 --> 01:08:05,516
"till catching her eye,
he withdrew his own and coldly said,

1027
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,356
"'She is tolerable but not handsome
enough to tempt me.

1028
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,954
"'I am in no humor at present to give
consequence to young ladies

1029
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,862
"'who are slighted by other men.

1030
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:17,902
"'You had better return to your partner
and enjoy her smiles,

1031
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,665
"'for you are wasting your time with me."'

1032
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:26,301
You know, I don't know if we can
do Pride and Prejudice next week,

1033
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:27,810
because it's the library dinner.

1034
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:30,643
Well, we need to go for Sylvia.
Daniel's bringing Pam.

1035
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:33,240
- That's so unnecessary.
- Tell me about it.

1036
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,878
- His firm's buying a table.
- Well, then we should buy one.

1037
01:08:35,954 --> 01:08:37,546
All of us, the book club.

1038
01:08:37,622 --> 01:08:39,419
- Show up in force.
- Yes.

1039
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:44,554
"The Central Valley River City
All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,"

1040
01:08:44,629 --> 01:08:45,994
is what Grigg calls it.

1041
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:48,464
He's so funny. I'm so glad
he finally made a date with Sylvia.

1042
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,091
He's taking her to lunch.

1043
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,160
I sure hope there's some dancing
in this thing.

1044
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:54,967
I'm trying to diet.

1045
01:08:56,107 --> 01:08:59,167
My husband is bringing a date
to my fundraiser.

1046
01:09:00,278 --> 01:09:02,178
Yeah, re-reading Pride and Prejudice again,

1047
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:04,238
I keep thinking,
"You know, courtship is easy."

1048
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:07,443
- Where's Austen's novel on divorce?
- I wouldn't say it was easy.

1049
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,113
Depends who you're courting, I guess.

1050
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:16,092
- Does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone?
- Occasionally.

1051
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:18,759
She used to date my husband
in high school.

1052
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,799
Then she sort of gave him to me.

1053
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,496
Daniel's the one
that first bought Jocelyn a dog.

1054
01:09:25,904 --> 01:09:31,035
- She traded your husband for a dog?
- Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...

1055
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:34,009
If loving is letting go,

1056
01:09:34,078 --> 01:09:39,516
then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to
have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.

1057
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:55,522
- Hey.
- Hi.

1058
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,624
Hey.

1059
01:09:56,701 --> 01:09:57,963
Do you know Lynne from my writing group?

1060
01:09:58,036 --> 01:10:00,095
- I don't, actually. Allegra.
- Hey.

1061
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:03,038
Listen, I just have to say,
you have been so good for Corinne.

1062
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:05,803
Ever since you two have been together,
she's been writing nonstop.

1063
01:10:05,877 --> 01:10:08,209
Didn't you just love that story
that she wrote last week?

1064
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:12,181
Well, Allegra and I don't discuss
what I'm working on.

1065
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,177
Okay.

1066
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,685
"Dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret

1067
01:10:26,231 --> 01:10:29,598
"that we must decline to publish
the three short stories you sent us.

1068
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,636
"Benny's Basketball" is strong narratively,

1069
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:38,108
"but the depiction of your penis-waving
retarded boy felt a little unkind.

1070
01:10:38,743 --> 01:10:43,077
"And isn't the title
"Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious

1071
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:45,308
"as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?

1072
01:10:45,383 --> 01:10:48,477
"Yet we confess that "Skydiver"
puzzled us most.

1073
01:10:49,254 --> 01:10:53,588
"Why would a beautiful, self-centered
young lesbian jump out of a plane?"

1074
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:05,368
I thought we could drive together.

1075
01:11:05,503 --> 01:11:08,165
We should hurry.
I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.

1076
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,230
- Sahara, off.
- Sylvia's already at the library.

1077
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:13,641
- She said she had to get there early.
- So you offered her a ride first.

1078
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:16,441
No, she happened to mention it at lunch.

1079
01:11:18,016 --> 01:11:19,813
That's a great dress.

1080
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,646
Stay.

1081
01:11:23,955 --> 01:11:28,289
I converted it to biodiesel.
So it basically runs on donut grease.

1082
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:34,362
This is so great. I never get to drive it.

1083
01:11:36,367 --> 01:11:38,358
Or vacuum it, apparently.

1084
01:11:43,074 --> 01:11:44,701
I like your hair.

1085
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:49,073
You need to dance with Sylvia tonight.

1086
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:53,045
- You do know how to dance, don't you?
- Of course I do.

1087
01:11:53,117 --> 01:11:55,881
I have three older sisters. I can dance.

1088
01:11:56,087 --> 01:11:58,612
Wait, if we stay in this lane,
we're gonna be late.

1089
01:11:58,723 --> 01:12:01,283
Given that I have to convert
donut grease into biofuel

1090
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,817
every time I fill up the tank,
I just try not to drive very fast.

1091
01:12:04,896 --> 01:12:06,659
We're barely moving.

1092
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,760
You ever read those Le Guin books
I bought you?

1093
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,269
I prefer books about real people.

1094
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,800
Okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real
and people in science fiction aren't.

1095
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,004
Is that it?

1096
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,174
Science fiction books have people in them,
but they're not about the people.

1097
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:26,614
Real people are complicated.

1098
01:12:26,684 --> 01:12:28,311
Well, there's all kinds of science fiction.

1099
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:32,117
When you've read some,
I will be interested in your opinion.

1100
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:36,351
- Why are you getting off here?
- I enjoy seeing the river.

1101
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:37,956
What are you, Mark Twain?

1102
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:40,827
Now we're gonna get stuck at every light.

1103
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,172
Look at the talent in this room.

1104
01:12:51,676 --> 01:12:54,008
Half the Silicon Valley is here.

1105
01:12:56,114 --> 01:12:57,411
To romance.

1106
01:12:57,482 --> 01:12:58,847
- Hi.
- Hello.

1107
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:03,814
I'm planning on meeting a software baron
and moving to Pemberley.

1108
01:13:03,888 --> 01:13:07,324
Well, everyone knows a rich man
is eventually going to want a new wife.

1109
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,118
- Hi.
- Hi.

1110
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,355
I'm Dean.

1111
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,160
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.

1112
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:17,463
Uh, moral support.
She's had a rough couple of weeks.

1113
01:13:17,535 --> 01:13:21,631
- Well, you're welcome to join in, Dean.
- Nah, that's okay.

1114
01:13:21,706 --> 01:13:25,164
I think I'll just head to the bar.
Let you ladies talk.

1115
01:13:25,243 --> 01:13:28,110
There is no bar. It's a library.

1116
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:30,647
- Serving liquor.
- Well, that'll work.

1117
01:13:30,715 --> 01:13:32,615
You guys need anything?

1118
01:13:34,152 --> 01:13:37,053
We had this big fight on the way over here.

1119
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:39,846
- Have some champagne.
- Mom?

1120
01:13:42,226 --> 01:13:44,217
I broke up with Corinne.

1121
01:13:45,163 --> 01:13:46,790
Oh, my God. Honey.

1122
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:53,370
- Nice.
- We have plenty of time.

1123
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,515
Honey, whatever happened between
you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.

1124
01:14:14,592 --> 01:14:17,891
- You don't even know what she did.
- Did she hit you?

1125
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,021
Did she say cruel things?

1126
01:14:21,966 --> 01:14:25,265
You are so quick to love. You're too quick.

1127
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:29,739
You jump in, you jump out.
That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.

1128
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:33,174
"It's not working? Well...
Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?"

1129
01:14:33,244 --> 01:14:38,307
We don't just dispose of people we love.
You stay. You repair.

1130
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:41,010
Okay, you know what?
This is not you and Daddy.

1131
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:44,020
This is Corinne. The difference being
that Daddy actually loves you.

1132
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:46,283
So you go repair. Power on.

1133
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,985
Maybe Daddy'll give up
this woman he's been fucking.

1134
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:52,085
- Allegra.
- But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.

1135
01:14:56,234 --> 01:14:59,533
- We're gonna be so late.
- I'll call a cab.

1136
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:03,040
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel
walks into that library with Pam.

1137
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:04,836
You got your phone?

1138
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,004
I'll find a payphone.

1139
01:15:11,082 --> 01:15:13,209
Are you attracted to Sylvia?

1140
01:15:14,785 --> 01:15:17,845
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.

1141
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,123
She's more than nice.
She's smart and funny...

1142
01:15:21,192 --> 01:15:25,356
- And she's in love with her husband.
- Well, she needs to get over that.

1143
01:15:27,698 --> 01:15:30,667
Why don't you stop interfering?
Let Sylvia work out her own life.

1144
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,327
It's interfering
to want my best friend to be happy.

1145
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,304
If that's interfering, I hope I never stop.

1146
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,972
What about me? Am I your friend?

1147
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:42,772
Or am I just some widget to help you
make Sylvia feel better about herself?

1148
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:45,438
Why did you invite me
to be part of your book club?

1149
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:47,643
What went through your mind
the first time you saw me?

1150
01:15:47,718 --> 01:15:51,313
"There's a man who is dying to read
every book Jane Austen ever wrote."

1151
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:53,016
- Is that what you thought?
- No.

1152
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:57,049
But I thought, "What a beautiful woman.
I hope she looks over at me."

1153
01:15:57,795 --> 01:16:00,195
I thought if I read your favorite books
that you would read mine.

1154
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,994
But, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.

1155
01:16:05,636 --> 01:16:07,627
That's why you have dogs.

1156
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:13,310
For such a famously romantic story,

1157
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:17,040
Pride and Prejudice is a parade
of bizarre marriages.

1158
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,480
I've had every marriage in this book.

1159
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:23,885
My first husband was a politician.
He was embarrassed by every move I made.

1160
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:26,446
He said I was rude and loud.

1161
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:30,051
"Stop pointing your breasts everywhere,"
he'd say to me.

1162
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:34,090
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.

1163
01:16:34,165 --> 01:16:36,861
I married the first man who looked at me.

1164
01:16:36,934 --> 01:16:39,528
Tout le monde est sage après le coup.

1165
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:45,038
You don't see your own marriage
until it's too late.

1166
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:51,313
So, um... I actually thought
that Charlotte Lucas was gay.

1167
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:56,745
Really, I think that when she tells Lizzie
she's not as romantic as she is,

1168
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,049
I think that's what she means.

1169
01:16:58,122 --> 01:17:02,183
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not.
She just... She just has no options.

1170
01:17:02,259 --> 01:17:04,784
Wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay

1171
01:17:04,862 --> 01:17:07,296
or Charlotte is gay
and Austen is not aware of it?

1172
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:11,392
I just love the idea
of a character having a secret life

1173
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:12,936
that the author doesn't even know about.

1174
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,939
You know, frankly,
I kind of admire Charlotte

1175
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,908
for looking at her situation
and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.

1176
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:22,468
I mean, yes, yes, she knows
he'll never be the "love of her life,"

1177
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:24,036
but that's okay.

1178
01:17:24,115 --> 01:17:26,345
That is exactly the reason
that Jocelyn would hate her.

1179
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:27,816
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone

1180
01:17:27,885 --> 01:17:29,853
who settles for anything less
than the perfect love.

1181
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,117
You know, it's probably why Jocelyn
has never married.

1182
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,158
My apologies, everybody.

1183
01:17:37,094 --> 01:17:38,891
- Hello.
- Hi.

1184
01:17:41,832 --> 01:17:43,925
We ran out of donut grease.

1185
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,702
- Grigg Harris.
- Dean Drummond.

1186
01:17:48,806 --> 01:17:51,206
- Wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club?
- Yeah.

1187
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:56,403
No, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg,"
and I just didn't picture it as a guy.

1188
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,812
So you thought Grigg was a girl?

1189
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:04,314
Dean thinks "Austen"
is the capital of Texas.

1190
01:18:06,524 --> 01:18:07,616
Wow.

1191
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:11,791
You'll notice that Jane,

1192
01:18:12,329 --> 01:18:15,423
she never shows what happens
after the wedding.

1193
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:19,398
Maybe Elizabeth and Darcy
start hating each other.

1194
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:22,205
Maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley,

1195
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:25,606
and she turned into this crazy person,
like her mom,

1196
01:18:25,676 --> 01:18:28,110
because our mothers are like time bombs.

1197
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:31,376
They just... They tick away inside of us.

1198
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:35,146
Let's not give Mrs. Bennet
more importance than she deserves.

1199
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:40,779
- You know, I mean, what about the father?
- What father?

1200
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:45,690
You know, my mom showed me
a picture of a guy in uniform.

1201
01:18:46,497 --> 01:18:48,522
Well, maybe she made him up.

1202
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,035
Or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.

1203
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:55,902
And I kept it in my room, this...

1204
01:18:59,477 --> 01:19:01,672
I kept it in my room.

1205
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,848
Let's not do this now, okay?

1206
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,954
Dean, I got it.

1207
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:02,736
Bernadette.

1208
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,601
Daniel never came.

1209
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:07,369
Good.

1210
01:20:25,996 --> 01:20:28,556
I'm in love with one of my students.

1211
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,237
But I mean, nothing's happened. Much.

1212
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:38,708
But it could.

1213
01:20:40,177 --> 01:20:42,042
It could, if I let it.

1214
01:20:44,648 --> 01:20:47,640
I fantasize about him constantly.

1215
01:20:48,152 --> 01:20:51,383
Sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.

1216
01:20:52,957 --> 01:20:59,863
He looks at me like he's the spoon,
and I'm the dish of ice cream.

1217
01:21:04,268 --> 01:21:07,738
It's a good thing we're reading
Sense and Sensibility next.

1218
01:21:24,188 --> 01:21:27,589
- I love you so.
- But how can you be sure in just one day?

1219
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:32,857
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in
or out of love, she knows it right away.

1220
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:38,662
- You think you're in love with me?
- Think?

1221
01:21:38,736 --> 01:21:42,866
What good does thinking do
but what I feel is something else?

1222
01:22:12,036 --> 01:22:13,469
- Hey, you got your cast off.
- Yeah.

1223
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:15,164
- How does it feel?
- Great.

1224
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:19,141
You can reach it.
Just really stretch your arm out.

1225
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,769
There you go.
Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.

1226
01:22:25,015 --> 01:22:27,040
You can do it, there... Can you put your...

1227
01:22:27,117 --> 01:22:30,109
Can you put your right foot
in that blue thing?

1228
01:22:30,187 --> 01:22:31,779
It's gonna be fine.

1229
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:34,585
- Here, hang on.
- You can reach it.

1230
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,319
- Just reach up.
- It's caught.

1231
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,759
It's okay. You're doing good.

1232
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:53,699
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt.
It's nothing.

1233
01:22:53,777 --> 01:22:55,677
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.

1234
01:22:55,746 --> 01:22:58,146
It's not likely to be anything
more than a concussion.

1235
01:22:58,215 --> 01:23:01,616
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation
for a few days, okay?

1236
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,483
And if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.

1237
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:12,055
How many times have we had to come here
to get her stitched up?

1238
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:14,196
- It's always Allegra, never the boys.
- Well, she's the one

1239
01:23:14,264 --> 01:23:18,667
who goes mountain climbing
and skateboarding and snowboarding.

1240
01:23:18,736 --> 01:23:21,671
It's a miracle she never tried parachuting.

1241
01:23:23,307 --> 01:23:24,968
She's so extreme.

1242
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:30,339
One minute she's crazy in love
with Corinne,

1243
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:33,474
the next minute she's never
hated anybody more.

1244
01:23:37,488 --> 01:23:39,922
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- She's fine.

1245
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,891
She just took a knock on the noodle.

1246
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,793
This is gonna sound, probably, horrible,
considering the fact that

1247
01:23:48,866 --> 01:23:52,825
she's got this lump on her head, but...
It's just...

1248
01:23:53,337 --> 01:23:56,306
It's great to have us all
in the same room again.

1249
01:23:57,474 --> 01:24:01,467
Just feels so normal.

1250
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,716
Normal, yeah.

1251
01:24:16,126 --> 01:24:19,960
You know, I haven't been seeing Pam
for a couple of months now.

1252
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:23,455
So, that must be a big change.

1253
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:27,235
You know, I was thinking just this morning

1254
01:24:27,304 --> 01:24:30,671
about this book club that we're in,
Allegra and me.

1255
01:24:31,575 --> 01:24:33,634
The first meeting was...

1256
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:39,041
Yeah, we had just been separated.
'Cause Allegra had just moved in.

1257
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:44,485
And I was realizing how different I feel.

1258
01:24:46,824 --> 01:24:48,758
I don't think I'm the same woman
that you left.

1259
01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:51,454
I can see that. I so see that.

1260
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:54,122
Well, it's probably the same for you.

1261
01:24:54,398 --> 01:24:57,458
I guess that's what happens
when you let go.

1262
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:04,001
We did a good job taking things apart.

1263
01:25:06,376 --> 01:25:08,241
I'm kind of proud of us.

1264
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:14,211
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts
making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.

1265
01:25:14,284 --> 01:25:17,185
You two just keep it together
for one more book.

1266
01:25:17,254 --> 01:25:19,950
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.

1267
01:25:22,793 --> 01:25:26,729
Austen sets up this juicy triangle
between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.

1268
01:25:26,797 --> 01:25:30,164
And then at the end, she practically
has to whip a rabbit out of a hat

1269
01:25:30,234 --> 01:25:32,600
to make Lucy Steele run off
with Edward's brother?

1270
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,467
- Yeah, that requires some hand-waving.
- I think the ending's well-plotted.

1271
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:40,636
To me, the part that seems forced is
Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.

1272
01:25:40,711 --> 01:25:43,305
- Anyone else feel that?
- Oh, I have no problem with that.

1273
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:49,376
He rides up on a big stallion,
sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.

1274
01:25:50,087 --> 01:25:52,419
From the time Colonel Brandon
meets Marianne,

1275
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:54,218
he just lavishes all this attention on her.

1276
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,657
And meanwhile,
she's throwing herself at Willoughby.

1277
01:25:56,727 --> 01:25:58,217
Willoughby is a player.

1278
01:25:58,295 --> 01:25:59,660
Women never go for the nice guy.

1279
01:25:59,763 --> 01:26:02,823
Please. Men say that, but you get to know
some of these men who complain the most,

1280
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:06,859
you find out they're not as nice
as they like to think they are.

1281
01:26:06,937 --> 01:26:08,666
Okay. You know what struck me?

1282
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:12,675
Is that Colonel Brandon is only
a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.

1283
01:26:12,743 --> 01:26:14,836
Well, why does he take up with
the daughter and not the mother?

1284
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:16,607
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?

1285
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,547
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
won't give him the time of day.

1286
01:26:19,616 --> 01:26:22,676
- The book is about the young people.
- Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks

1287
01:26:22,753 --> 01:26:25,313
that nothing interesting can happen
to a woman over 25.

1288
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:30,884
When actually, a novel about a woman
seducing a slightly younger man

1289
01:26:31,361 --> 01:26:33,352
just yields so much more.

1290
01:26:34,164 --> 01:26:37,133
Well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood
should go for Willoughby.

1291
01:26:37,201 --> 01:26:38,498
Why not?

1292
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:41,330
It's a long, hot summer.

1293
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,464
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
has more sense than that.

1294
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,407
Okay, can I just point out,
she's hardly in the story.

1295
01:26:46,476 --> 01:26:48,205
Sex is messy.

1296
01:26:48,278 --> 01:26:51,145
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
prefers a more well-ordered life.

1297
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:54,707
Maybe that's why
she's such a minor character.

1298
01:26:54,785 --> 01:26:57,185
- I think if you read Austen's novels...
- Oh, I have.

1299
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:58,380
You wanted me to, and I did.

1300
01:26:58,455 --> 01:27:02,915
I think you'll see she always writes
in favor of order and self-control.

1301
01:27:02,993 --> 01:27:05,257
- Nothing unwise.
- Nothing in haste.

1302
01:27:05,329 --> 01:27:08,298
Okay, so, this is...
This is what, this is a rulebook?

1303
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:09,457
We could do worse.

1304
01:27:09,533 --> 01:27:12,502
I think Jane Austen wrote about women
falling in love because she was Ionely.

1305
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:14,764
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.

1306
01:27:14,838 --> 01:27:18,069
Austen lived a very full life.
She could've gotten married anytime.

1307
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:19,768
- She almost did.
- That's right.

1308
01:27:19,843 --> 01:27:23,802
- But she decided not to.
- Why, too messy? Too out of control?

1309
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:31,649
His name was Harris Bigg-Wither,
and they were engaged for one night.

1310
01:27:31,722 --> 01:27:35,556
"Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither!"
I can't believe you know that.

1311
01:27:36,493 --> 01:27:39,929
I understand why Colonel Brandon
goes for Marianne.

1312
01:27:39,997 --> 01:27:41,726
And it's not 'cause she's young.

1313
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:46,565
It's because she's generous with herself.

1314
01:27:48,272 --> 01:27:52,641
She's willing to risk her heart.
No rules, no fear.

1315
01:27:54,578 --> 01:27:58,446
- And Willoughby tramples her.
- She just picked the wrong guy.

1316
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,577
No rules, no fear.

1317
01:28:03,787 --> 01:28:05,186
I like that.

1318
01:28:34,318 --> 01:28:37,253
- Hi.
- You're wearing that to your book club?

1319
01:28:37,321 --> 01:28:41,621
It's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day,

1320
01:28:41,692 --> 01:28:44,252
'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme,

1321
01:28:44,328 --> 01:28:47,957
which is, you know,
like, the beach in England.

1322
01:28:48,065 --> 01:28:49,930
This is your last one, right?

1323
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,492
I think we're gonna do some more books
after this one.

1324
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:23,194
Prudie's gonna be hours late
and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.

1325
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,225
Thank God it's the last meeting.

1326
01:29:26,303 --> 01:29:29,101
Yes, there's getting to be
a little too much plot.

1327
01:29:29,172 --> 01:29:30,332
Not that I blame Grigg.

1328
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:35,435
Something about reading Austen
sort of makes you wanna get it on.

1329
01:29:35,512 --> 01:29:36,536
Hi.

1330
01:29:38,615 --> 01:29:41,982
Started reading it with Allegra
at the hospital. This is a great book.

1331
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:44,417
Are you joining our discussion?

1332
01:29:45,455 --> 01:29:48,015
- Am I? 'Cause I'd like to.
- Hi.

1333
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,489
- Daniel wants to join us.
- Well he's not in the club, is he?

1334
01:29:51,561 --> 01:29:54,655
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen.
So far.

1335
01:29:56,867 --> 01:29:59,768
It's all about mistakes and second chances.

1336
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:03,834
Yeah, you can stay.

1337
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,133
Glass of wine?

1338
01:31:19,816 --> 01:31:23,252
I can't believe he brought a date
to our last meeting.

1339
01:31:24,554 --> 01:31:29,958
- I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling.
- For me?

1340
01:31:30,894 --> 01:31:33,192
Honey, I took your boyfriend away from you
in high school.

1341
01:31:33,263 --> 01:31:35,561
Look how that turned out.

1342
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:38,366
- Hi.
- Hey.

1343
01:31:38,435 --> 01:31:40,528
- How ya doing?
- Guys, this is Cat.

1344
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:43,664
- Hello.
- I'm Grigg's big sister.

1345
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:49,235
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so...
I'm... God, that's wonderful.

1346
01:31:49,312 --> 01:31:51,371
You're Grigg's sister.
I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.

1347
01:31:51,448 --> 01:31:52,574
- How are you?
- Hi.

1348
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:54,640
- Good, thank you.
- Hi. Bernadette.

1349
01:31:56,686 --> 01:31:59,814
- I don't believe it.
- Look at you!

1350
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,755
- You look great.
- Good to see you.

1351
01:32:01,825 --> 01:32:03,452
Thank you.

1352
01:32:03,527 --> 01:32:05,995
- Wow, are you visiting from Idaho?
- Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:10,089
We kept seeing these emails.
And we said, "What kind of strange power

1354
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:14,000
"do these women have
that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?"

1355
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:18,598
Just thought I'd check it out.
You wanna take a walk?

1356
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:20,974
Well, sure.

1357
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,611
Excuse me.

1358
01:32:31,521 --> 01:32:34,354
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!

1359
01:32:35,025 --> 01:32:38,324
- Hi.
- Dr. Yep?

1360
01:32:38,395 --> 01:32:40,829
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.

1361
01:32:40,897 --> 01:32:45,561
- I'm sorry we're late.
- Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.

1362
01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:47,034
Is that Dad?

1363
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,803
- Let's say hi.
- Okay.

1364
01:32:53,843 --> 01:32:55,105
A doctor.

1365
01:32:57,581 --> 01:32:59,242
Nothing in haste.

1366
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:02,145
- Dad! Hi!
- Hey.

1367
01:33:10,594 --> 01:33:12,562
Would you do me a favor?

1368
01:33:13,863 --> 01:33:15,626
Would you read this?

1369
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,500
Please. Right now.

1370
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:23,102
Isn't that what your
special little book club's for?

1371
01:33:25,275 --> 01:33:27,470
I really want you to read it.

1372
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,635
Please, Dean.

1373
01:33:36,086 --> 01:33:38,213
It doesn't... They don't...

1374
01:33:38,755 --> 01:33:41,883
Prudie, I feel like you want me
to be something that I'm not.

1375
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:45,689
I just walk around being me.
I don't pretend to be anything else.

1376
01:33:45,762 --> 01:33:47,593
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen"
is a city in Texas.

1377
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,224
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.

1378
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,359
You just set me up for a test
that you don't want me to pass.

1379
01:33:52,435 --> 01:33:56,201
No, no. This is not a test.

1380
01:33:56,272 --> 01:33:57,967
This is something to share.

1381
01:33:58,041 --> 01:34:00,942
Why don't you just tell me what it's about?

1382
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:08,711
It's about these two people
who used to love each other.

1383
01:34:09,653 --> 01:34:11,553
And they don't anymore.

1384
01:34:12,656 --> 01:34:16,456
And it's how they persuade themselves
to give it another try.

1385
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:21,630
Look, I can get you started off. Okay?

1386
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,131
- "Sir Walter Eliot...
- Prudie.

1387
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,997
"...of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire
was a man who...

1388
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:28,663
"for his own amusement, never took up
any book but the..."

1389
01:34:28,738 --> 01:34:32,469
Come on, you're really not gonna
read all of this out loud.

1390
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,440
One page.

1391
01:34:41,951 --> 01:34:45,887
"There he found occupation
for an idle hour

1392
01:34:45,989 --> 01:34:48,150
"and consolation in a distressed one."

1393
01:34:48,425 --> 01:34:49,824
- Come on.
- So I've been trying to figure out

1394
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:53,329
that moment in Persuasion when
Wentworth and Anne

1395
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:55,762
just began to stop hating each other.

1396
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,430
Maybe it's when they went
with everyone to Lyme.

1397
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:01,436
After Louisa Musgrove fell.

1398
01:35:01,504 --> 01:35:04,166
After Wentworth used her
to make Anne jealous.

1399
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,832
You think he was using Louisa?

1400
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,241
Yeah. That's one interpretation.

1401
01:35:09,713 --> 01:35:12,910
- I think the guy was just trying to feel...
- Valued again.

1402
01:35:12,982 --> 01:35:14,745
It was a bonehead move.

1403
01:35:14,818 --> 01:35:16,683
I mean, he knows he's nothing
without Anne.

1404
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:19,278
He loved her then, he loves her now.

1405
01:35:19,956 --> 01:35:22,982
I like how Austen always lets the men
explain themselves.

1406
01:35:23,059 --> 01:35:25,550
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet
in Pride and Prejudice,

1407
01:35:25,628 --> 01:35:26,993
and Frank writes to Emma.

1408
01:35:27,063 --> 01:35:30,931
Yeah, in Persuasion, everything hangs on
Wentworth leaving her that note

1409
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,868
- when everybody's talking all around them.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.

1410
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:39,371
No, smart guy. Perfect timing.

1411
01:35:39,876 --> 01:35:40,968
Yeah.

1412
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:46,547
Let us never underestimate the power
of a well-written letter.

1413
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:50,242
Grigg has always loved dogs.

1414
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,845
You know, we were never allowed
to have one when we were kids.

1415
01:35:52,922 --> 01:35:55,720
Dogs and books. That's our Grigg.

1416
01:35:56,459 --> 01:36:00,225
Okay, he'd kill me for saying this,
but my brother likes you.

1417
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:04,198
I'm figuring he'll never tell you.
And this way it's up to you.

1418
01:36:04,834 --> 01:36:08,964
My sisters and me,
I wouldn't say we ruined him,

1419
01:36:09,038 --> 01:36:12,997
but he's just way too considerate
to make the first move.

1420
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:16,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

1421
01:36:16,212 --> 01:36:20,615
I was just wishing that Austen
had written a bunch more books, you know?

1422
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:23,114
I'm gonna miss this.

1423
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:26,618
"All of the ladies were contented to pass
quietly and carefully down the steep flight,

1424
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:27,781
"excepting Louisa.

1425
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:30,382
"She must be jumped down them
by Captain Wentworth.

1426
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,156
"She was safely down and instantly,
to show her enjoyment,

1427
01:36:33,229 --> 01:36:35,163
"ran up the steps to be jumped down again.

1428
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:37,893
"He advised her against it, but no..."

1429
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,319
Shoot.

1430
01:39:09,052 --> 01:39:12,749
I'm so sorry. I should've called first.
I read these books.

1431
01:39:13,756 --> 01:39:15,087
I love them.

1432
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:16,250
I couldn't stop reading.

1433
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:20,057
I went to the all-night newsstand on
State Street to buy Searoad, the next one,

1434
01:39:20,129 --> 01:39:23,565
- but they didn't have it, and...
- Do you wanna borrow Searoad?

1435
01:39:23,633 --> 01:39:26,193
I mean, I have... You know, there...

1436
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:30,405
There are other writers that you might like.

1437
01:40:02,905 --> 01:40:03,963
Hey.

1438
01:40:05,475 --> 01:40:06,840
Hi, honey.

1439
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:09,910
I didn't expect you back so soon.

1440
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,186
Wait, wait, wait.

1441
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:04,298
Hey, has anyone read those
Patrick O'Brian novels?

1442
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:07,234
- British Navy.
- Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.

1443
01:41:07,303 --> 01:41:09,294
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?

1444
01:41:09,372 --> 01:41:11,704
- There's more of us now.
- I'm in.

1445
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:18,440
- Oh, my God, is that Bernadette?
- I thought she was in Costa Rica.

1446
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:22,951
Buenas noches, everyone.
This is Señor Obando.

1447
01:41:23,019 --> 01:41:24,919
- Hola.
- Hello.

1448
01:41:24,987 --> 01:41:28,252
- Hello.
- He's working on his English.

1449
01:41:28,324 --> 01:41:30,724
- I'm working on my Spanish.
- Hello.

1450
01:41:32,762 --> 01:41:35,458
And so far I have te amo.

1451
01:41:36,699 --> 01:41:37,791
And mi esposo.

1452
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,595
- Oh, my God!
- Congratulations!

1453
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:43,503
- That's incredible!
- That's incredible. Congratulations!

1454
01:41:43,573 --> 01:41:45,370
- Oh, it's gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1455
01:41:45,441 --> 01:41:46,499
- I'm so happy for you.
- Congratulations.

1456
01:41:46,576 --> 01:41:50,273
- Dad, check it out.
- Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.

1457
01:41:55,084 --> 01:41:57,484
- Don't be gone too long.
- Yikes. That makes seven.

1458
01:41:57,553 --> 01:41:58,952
- What?
- Yeah.

1459
01:42:02,925 --> 01:42:04,688
Hey, guys. Guys.

1460
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,092
He hasn't read a word of Austen.

1461
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:10,966
Oh, poor man.

1462
01:42:11,734 --> 01:42:14,703
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.

1463
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,767
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
