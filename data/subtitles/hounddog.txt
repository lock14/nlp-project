poison in the soul.



Turn them by some poison,which can
kill you,into something powerful and good.



This will fix you right up...

She's something, ain't she?



- But she's singing it all wrong.
Oh no,missy,she's singing it all right.



But that's Elvis' song.



- No,maam.
- Is so.



Missy,that's Willie Mae Thornton



They call her"Big Mama" now, she hit
number one with "Hounddog" in 1953,

Hurry.



Lewellen? Lewellen?



Missy,I know you're hiding there.



This ain't no time for your hiding games.



Your daddy's been struck by lightning.



What?



Your daddy's been struck.



By lightning?



By God.



Is he dead?



For your sins, was it.



No, ma'am.



You better run, boy.



We were doing nothing.



Is he dead? Is my daddy dead?



Maybe it was you who struck him down.



What were doing out in that shack,
while you daddy was out working the fields?



What were you doing,missy?



Nothing.



Can I go for an ice cream?



One scoop,you'll spoil your dinner.



Be home before dark.



Lewellen? Stay out of the tall grass.



Snakes are in the tall grass.



He's stupid now,right?



No.



That's what my daddy says.



Well,he's not.



It is poisonous?



No, stupid.



Hold your arm out.



Come on,it won't hurt you,

Wow... yeah.



Can I have it?



Sure.



I gotta go.



Why? It ain't dark yet.



I gotta go.



Lightning struck...



first thing, it gives an awful thirst



You have to keep a close watch on him,



'Cause they'll try to drink the entire river.



I was in Pensacola



fishing with my brother,



we saw a man crazy with thirsty



He was drinking the ocean water like
it was whiskey, died from the salt.



Just gotta always be careful
handling the dead snake.



Always use the stick.



Reflex action make the poison of a
snake bite even after he's dead.



Grammie says you must
drink whiskey,if you're bit.



It gets right in the blood
and kills the poison.



Always drink whiskey for a snake bite?



But only the celebrities
who are still alive make it known.



That whiskey will move that poison
so fast through your blood ,



to your heart and knock you flat dead.



You think God will strike you down
for your sins?



No,missy,I don't.



You think God will strike you
down for someone else's sins?



No,missy, I know he don't do that.



I'm a sinner.



Yes, we're all sinners.



Did you ever put the sinners here,
and they gotta be got rid of..



I think God put us all here,



I think he put every single one of us here.



My daddy's thirsty all the time.



You keep a close watch on him.



What's wrong,daddy?



I can't remember my name.



Lou.



- Lou?
- Yeah..

you shared the first part of my name,
you remember?



The first part of my name is you,



'Cause you're my daddy, remember?



What am I called Lou?

Well,the first reason I preach against it,is
because of this right here the word of God.



- Amen
- Amen.. I believe this music...



is 100% responsible for the delinquency
of our youth today.



And the reason I believe that, 'cause
I know what it feels like when you sing.



I know what it feels like
when you listen to it,



I know the evil thoughts and desires that
come over..



you when you get swept away in the beat.



And you ask an average young person,



what it is they like this music so much they
are going to tell you one thing.



Didn't I tell you,it's the beat.
it's the beat,it's the beat.



it's the beat!



And we are a music loving church here,



we sing our hymns of praise
each and every week to the Lord



The Bible says, make a joyful
noise unto the Lord,



but there is nothing joyful
about this rock n roll music, because...



Thank you very much,
thanks for coming.

Lewellen is fine.



But I want to take her with me.
You can't her with you,she's mine.



You said she's yours,

I loved him.



You sinned,with your
 own sister's husband.



You made him marry her.
- He got her pregnant.



But he loved me, mom.
I was the one, he loved.



So what was he doing sleeping
with your sister?



It was just once, one time
and he didn't even mean it.



Lewellen should have been mine,
and you know it.



Because I was the one that he loved.



He never loved you.



You wanted him too.



That's why you still
 keeping him around.



Go on,shoot me, mom.

And we all would play,



It was so beautiful, I just had to cry,



I was feeling so safe there
in your mamma's arms.



And when we was all finished singing



mamma will carry you across the field



and slip into the kitchen door
and put you in your bed...



Without waking your mamma.



Oh,your mamma was good.
She was so good.



God, I miss her.



I do miss her.



Why don't you take  Lewellen?



- I can't...
- You could.



Her eyes are too big,
it makes me scared.



Looking in the mirror.



Oh,no I feel I up....



 I can't breathe sometimes,I feel I get
 all choked up,when I'm near her.



Maybe you, finally be putting your arms 




all round yourself the way
 your mamma never could.

I hate you...



I hate you...



- Leave me alone
you can't let...



...without your spirit
- Leave me alone, I hate you.



Leave me alone.



Get up. Get up.



I can't shake no more.



You don't have to shake.



If you stand still you can
reach deeper into the sound.



I can't sing.



Is hiding in the dark Lewellen.



Stand still and reach down deep.



Stand still.



Stand very,very still.



There it is.



The Rattler got powerful medicine..



If you make good when your done...



the spirits fly free



and the ghosts don't chase after you



if you don't



the spirits slither after you and drive you mad.



Gotta always somehow make
good of what can pause in you



For you to shake.



Look at you.



I love you.



What you got there?



You know, I'm thinking...



I got a fenced-in backyard now,
in this new place I moved in,



It would be great for a puppy.



But you'd have come too.



'Cause I could not take of it
all by myself,you know?



And you can do it.



And he needs you.



I just couldn't breathe, Lewellen.



I couldn't breathe.



I was scared, you know?



I feel I can breathe now.



I got a room made up for you.



And a record player?
- Yeah,I do



I do.. got a player.



Just get in here,come on



I gotta check and see.



I just can't say you can't.. no?



I'll wait right here.



I'll be waiting right here for you.



Did I get it?



I Got it.



Daddy?



Yes, maam.



I love you.



Yes, maam.
