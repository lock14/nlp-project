1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,325
<i>My favorite children's book
is about a little prince</i>

2
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:13,107
<i>who came to Earth
from a distant asteroid.</i>

3
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:17,614
<i>He meets a pilot whose plane
has crashed in the desert.</i>

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,506
<i>The little prince teaches the pilot
many things, but mainly about love.</i>

5
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>My father always told me
I was like the little prince,</i>

6
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,548
<i>but after I met Adam,</i>

7
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:31,617
<i>I realized I was the pilot
all along.</i>

8
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,032
Morning, Adam.

9
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,758
Good morning, Kelli.

10
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:26,074
Good morning, Lulu.

11
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,416
Good morning, Adam.

12
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,117
I don't know what to say.

13
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,363
Say anything.

14
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,912
Okay, Adam Raki is the cutest
guy in the office. How's that?

15
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,118
- That's fine.
- Morning, Adam.

16
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,364
Good morning, Mr. Klieber.

17
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,187
Good morning, Kelli.

18
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,913
Good morning.

19
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,351
Good morning, Adam.

20
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:46,886
- How did she do that?
- What? What?

21
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,379
How did she know it was me
and then you talking?

22
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,010
Oh, voice recognition.

23
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,216
I put in voice patterns from
some people in the office

24
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,806
and added SPLICE
to the recognition system.

25
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,245
SPLICE stands for

26
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,601
stereo-based piece-wise linear
compensation for environments.

27
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,327
It's an algorithm that I placed...

28
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:05,013
Adam, Adam, did Chatty
Patty have SPLICE?

29
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,986
Did Big Mouth Billy Bass
have SPLICE?

30
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,096
You said I could make her
sound like Kelli.

31
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,438
I said she could sound like Kelli.

32
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,069
I didn't say to give her free will.

33
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:16,905
She doesn't have free will.

34
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,304
5,000 at $100, not five at $1,000.

35
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,701
Capisce?

36
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,017
Good-bye, Mr. Klieber.

37
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:28,031
Good-bye, Adam.

38
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:17,807
<i>All of which gives us
the rare opportunity</i>

39
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,629
<i>...to explore the
mysterious terrain</i>

40
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,986
<i>that lies between
fame and craft.</i>

41
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,206
<i>Between the public persona
and the private precious self.</i>

42
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,084
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Actor's Studio</i>

43
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,673
<i>is proud to welcome
an actress we admire</i>

44
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,071
<i>Julia Roberts.</i>

45
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:47,059
Perfect.

46
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,087
Oh.

47
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,005
Is this open?

48
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,595
I mean to residents?

49
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,034
Do you have a key?

50
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,336
Oh, yes.

51
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:00,582
I just moved in.

52
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:01,733
Beth Buchwald.

53
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,884
3A.

54
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,186
Adam. Second floor, two.

55
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,734
You're not doing your laundry?

56
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,666
Oh... um... yeah.

57
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,831
Looks like a bit of an emergency.

58
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:20,723
Would you mind letting me in?

59
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,833
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

60
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,272
Thanks.

61
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,601
I mean, I loved it downtown

62
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:33,191
that's my hood,
but this place is bigger,

63
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,972
and it's right around the
corner from Wildwood.

64
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:38,849
Can you see the sky
from the third floor?

65
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,631
I guess I would if the windows
weren't covered in soot.

66
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,892
Some nerve, right?

67
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,249
Calling a school in the middle
of Manhattan "Wildwood. "

68
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:51,414
It's just temporary, actually.

69
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,003
The job, not the name
of the school.

70
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,401
I'm a writer, for children,
so it's a good experience.

71
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,935
What do you do?

72
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,141
Uh, I help make toys.

73
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,483
Oh, you're an elf?

74
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,114
No, I'm a...

75
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,033
I'm an electronic engineer.

76
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,965
Oh, you need a card for the wash.

77
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,404
No, I've got one.

78
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,185
Funny.

79
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,295
I think I left mine
upstairs in my packet.

80
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,405
Could I borrow yours for now?

81
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,665
Okay.

82
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,791
Thanks.

83
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:36,490
Good. Good work, Beth.

84
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,491
Hi, neighbor.

85
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:48,191
There are new images of Saturn
from the Cassini project.

86
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,810
Oh. God.

87
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,455
I always wished I knew
more about space.

88
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,332
You did?
Like what?

89
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,770
I don't know.

90
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,880
You know, what's out there.

91
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,333
You have to narrow that down.

92
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,868
Yeah, I guess you're right.

93
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,307
Oh, well, I have books

94
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:20,225
and telescopes, star charts.

95
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,855
You could borrow some stuff.

96
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,691
And we could go out,
look at sky, tonight.

97
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,856
Maybe, sometime. Sure.

98
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,582
Okay.

99
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:34,323
Well, I'll just be hauling

100
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,433
these enormous grocery
bags upstairs now.

101
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,255
Okay.

102
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,749
Okay.

103
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,892
What are you doing?

104
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:16,906
Oh...

105
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:18,632
People watching.

106
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,893
Anyone in particular?

107
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,770
Oh, just people.

108
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,074
Listen, I'm going out with
some friends tonight later,

109
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,704
if you want to come.

110
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,335
Oh.

111
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:38,965
They're people,

112
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,171
so you might want to watch them.

113
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,377
Uh-huh.

114
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:45,199
But, if not, you know, that's fine.

115
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,172
No, I want to go, but, um, I...

116
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,898
I don't think I can.

117
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:51,530
Okay, if you're busy.

118
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,968
No.

119
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,311
I mean, it's not a date.

120
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:57,572
It's just a little moving-in
celebration, you know?

121
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,490
When?

122
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:01,983
8:00?
8:00-ish.

123
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,613
Uh-huh.

124
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,340
Look, there's no pressure.

125
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,737
I'll just knock on your
door on my way out,

126
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,368
and if you can, you can.

127
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,094
Okay.

128
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,628
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,259
Okay.

130
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,831
Adam?

131
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,449
Adam?

132
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,592
Good night!

133
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,895
I... I'm sorry I didn't come
out with your friends.

134
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,909
No problem.

135
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:04,074
I get kind of overloaded.

136
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,678
I have something to show you.

137
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:13,665
Come in, come in.

138
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,954
Oh, my!

139
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:27,668
You said you want to know
more about space.

140
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,065
Because it looks like this

141
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,408
people think of it as still

142
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:33,326
even though we know
it's expanding.

143
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,628
All parts of the universe are
moving away from one another.

144
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,410
Most of them faster
than the speed of light

145
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,479
- except for... - I thought nothing
went faster than the speed of light.

146
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,205
Right, right.

147
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,219
Uh, nothing goes
through space faster

148
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:46,466
but space itself...

149
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:49,918
Okay, um, you know
about the big bang?

150
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:52,604
A little, uh, "In the beginning,

151
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,330
- God created... "
- Inflation theory says

152
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,960
the big bang came
from as little as

153
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,550
a 20-pound chunk of space,
about 14 billion years ago

154
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,468
that expanded to the
size of the universe

155
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,579
in 10 to the minus 39 seconds.

156
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,784
- 10 to the minus 39?
- A decimal point,

157
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,127
39 zeroes and then a one.

158
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:07,470
That's the fraction of a second

159
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,908
in which the universe was formed.

160
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,649
That's billions and billions
of times faster than light.

161
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:16,197
Hmm, that's... fast.

162
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:19,266
Yeah.

163
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,268
Wow!

164
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:29,241
These are all pictures
of stars and galaxies

165
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,351
that have been traveling
away from us

166
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,324
for hundreds of millions
or billions of years.

167
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,050
But, but that's still nearby

168
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,831
compared to most of the
universe that we'll never see.

169
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,709
- Never?
- Well, things

170
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,243
that move apart faster than light,

171
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,449
can't ever see one another
because the light from one

172
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:46,791
never catches up to the other.

173
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:50,245
After the big bang, the
expansion of the universe

174
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:53,506
slowed down, but then,
after seven billion years,

175
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,807
for some reason,
it speeded up again

176
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,205
and it's been speeding
up ever since.

177
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:02,425
Some day, everything you see
here will disappear forever.

178
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,781
And, eventually, the night sky

179
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:09,522
will be almost completely dark.

180
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,428
That's kind of sad.

181
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,401
Sad?

182
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:28,512
I... I've been talking
too much, so...

183
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,909
No, it's... fascinating.

184
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,019
But I talk too much
when I get excited.

185
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,170
No, really.

186
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,896
It's, it's amazing.

187
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,391
Well, I... I could tell you
quickly about embrain theory.

188
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,117
Oh, no, it's okay.

189
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,652
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

190
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,666
It's very speculative.

191
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,022
I should go.

192
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,105
Good night, Beth.

193
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,215
Good night.

194
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,914
Thanks!

195
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,832
I love your planetarium.

196
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:01,888
Oh...

197
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,998
You're welcome.

198
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,740
Well, I could've waited, Daddy.

199
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,274
Not another day.

200
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,480
I wanted you out of that
rattrap for five years.

201
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,398
- They were mice.
- But I was right, wasn't I?

202
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:22,028
You love it.

203
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,755
It's okay, it's not like the Village.

204
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,194
I've only met one person so far.

205
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,537
It's new.

206
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,551
He did have a planetarium
in his living room, though.

207
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:29,893
You were in someone's
living room?

208
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,387
He's cute; he lives
in the building.

209
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,305
What ever happened
to Rich Litman?

210
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,127
Not going there.

211
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:40,251
Now, what was the name of his
company? Founder's Fund?

212
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,977
Okay, okay.

213
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,375
So, your neighbor's
an astronomer?

214
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:47,348
No, he's an electronic engineer,
whatever that means.

215
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:49,747
But he hasn't even said hello
to me since the first time.

216
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:50,706
So, he's an idiot.

217
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,432
No, it's me.

218
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,117
Didn't anyone tell you
and Mom that only children

219
00:15:55,213 --> 00:16:00,392
are emotional retards, spoiled,
too trusting and unequipped to cope?

220
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,502
What were you thinking?

221
00:16:02,598 --> 00:16:05,667
That we had one perfect child.

222
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:09,503
How's school?

223
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,709
We just started.

224
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,107
"The course of civilization
is a race between

225
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,121
catastrophe and education. "
John F. Kennedy.

226
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:17,943
I know.

227
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,725
Now, if you marry an investment banker,
you could do whatever you want.

228
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:23,314
Rich Litman is a dick, Daddy,
can we leave it at that?

229
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,520
Don't say "dick" to your father.

230
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,301
No one's perfect, Bethie.

231
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:30,315
That's all I'm saying.

232
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,727
But there's sensor systems
that detected an error

233
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,357
- in analyzing space figures...
- Adam...

234
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,468
I'm having lunch.

235
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,098
- Speak English.
- I'm sorry.

236
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:42,304
See, the star tracker system...

237
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,373
No... No more background radiation,
black holes

238
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,250
or Mars robots.

239
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,264
Lunch time is for guy talk.

240
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,525
Two guys talking about women,
the weather and such.

241
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,635
You got it?

242
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,855
- But the star tracker systems...
- No.

243
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,350
A woman moved into 3A.

244
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,611
All right, now, that's lunch talk.

245
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,762
So?

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,022
So, that's all.

247
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,653
Well, no...

248
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:22,489
A woman moved into 3A,
she looked...?

249
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,408
She looked nice.

250
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:25,751
Good.

251
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,285
Good!

252
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,450
- Uh, you gonna meet her?
- I did.

253
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,080
You did?

254
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,190
We did laundry; she came
to my apartment.

255
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,821
She did?

256
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,547
And I told her some about space.

257
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:39,753
Oh, Jesus, how'd she take it?

258
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,095
She liked it.

259
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,438
She...

260
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,644
Well, bless my stars!

261
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,178
You gonna see her again?

262
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,673
I see her almost every day.

263
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,111
You talk to her again?

264
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,605
No.

265
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:56,057
Adam... you're the man.

266
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,167
You have to start the conversation.

267
00:17:58,263 --> 00:17:59,798
Ask her out; take her to dinner.

268
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:02,291
I can't do that. H-How...

269
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,429
This jackass locks himself
out of his car,

270
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,018
figures he can cuss me
out on the phone.

271
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:14,568
Well, he ought to
be chill by now.

272
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,486
Harlan...

273
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:19,843
Follow through, young man.

274
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,953
Follow through.

275
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,844
Are you and Mom still going
to Barbados this year?

276
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,433
Well, we're still deciding.

277
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,351
Oh, really?

278
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,708
There's a little problem
that has to be dealt with.

279
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,339
Between you and Mom?

280
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:38,641
No, no, at the firm.

281
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:39,983
Oh.

282
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,189
There was an indictment
last March.

283
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,779
There was an indictment
of the firm?

284
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,848
No, of me... personally, no less.

285
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:48,998
It's nothing.

286
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,876
Some junior G-man playing
Clarence Darrow.

287
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,273
But there's a trial date now:
January 19.

288
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,904
- A trial?!
- Yeah.

289
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,918
So we have to work everything
out before then.

290
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,316
But bullshit, if you'll excuse
the expression,

291
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,042
expands to Philly
a lot of times

292
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,248
so now Barbados is up in the air.

293
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,276
Daddy!

294
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:09,715
Don't worry.

295
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,208
But if you happen to come up
with the next Harry Potter,

296
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,318
we may need it to pay
the goniff lawyers.

297
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,332
Home Friday for dinner, right?

298
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,154
Yeah.

299
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,689
I love you, Daddy!

300
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:20,936
Love you!

301
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,518
Beth?

302
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,588
Beth?

303
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:09,561
Adam.

304
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm so sorry,

305
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:13,974
I just don't feel like
any company tonight.

306
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,988
Oh, that's okay.

307
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,043
Come out with me.

308
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:19,057
I want to show you something.

309
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,715
Beth?

310
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,222
Adam, the park's closed.

311
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,757
Just a little bit further.

312
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:31,908
I want to go back.

313
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:32,963
- I'm not...
- Shh.

314
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,018
Over here.

315
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,897
Adam, I...

316
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,121
A raccoon in Central Park?

317
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:35,495
That was so cool.

318
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,468
What are they doing here?

319
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,441
Foraging.

320
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:43,263
How did you know
where they'd be?

321
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,277
They live here.

322
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:47,964
I used to come and
watch them a lot.

323
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,978
It's quiet.

324
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:56,211
They don't really belong here,
you know, but...

325
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:59,280
here they are.

326
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:02,157
They're coming back around
in a little while.

327
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:04,171
You want to wait?

328
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,185
Yeah, sure.

329
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,329
Wh... Oh, Mr. Klieber.

330
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, that's all right.

331
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,398
I... startled you.

332
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:44,453
Yes.

333
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:45,700
I just wanted

334
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,577
to tell you what a good job
you've done for us

335
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:50,016
the last year and a half.

336
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,126
Well, that's good.

337
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,427
When your father explained your...

338
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:58,360
you know, when he
explained your... things...

339
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:01,142
Well, I had my-my doubts,
but he was right...

340
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:03,731
a man of your background
at the salary you're getting

341
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:05,553
has been a value to this company.

342
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:06,992
Well, that's good.

343
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,485
Yes... but the world is changing.

344
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,787
You can't be the corner
candy store anymore;

345
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:13,225
you've got to compete.

346
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:14,472
Candy store?

347
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,925
5,000 at a hundred,
not five at a thousand.

348
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,706
Adam, I've got to let you go.

349
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:22,625
But I will write you
a recommendation

350
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:25,310
- that will knock your socks off.
- Let me go?

351
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:28,379
- I'm truly sorry.
- But I... I don't want to go.

352
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,626
- Hold on.
- But I haven't finished.

353
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,120
- I still have...
- I have a bid, Adam. It's done.

354
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:34,805
On a better chip?

355
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,970
Not better, cheaper.

356
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:41,422
Look, go home, talk it over

357
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:42,957
with your dad...
I'm sure he'll

358
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:45,067
- find you another job before
you know it. - But my dad...

359
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,218
Kelli has your severance.

360
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:48,041
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

361
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:51,206
And I mean that, sincerely.

362
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:52,836
Good-bye, Adam.

363
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,576
Good-bye, Mr. Klieber.

364
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,112
Adam, dude, sorry about that.

365
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,468
Don't worry about it, bro.
Something will come up, man, I promise.

366
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,142
I'm so sorry, Adam.

367
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:18,251
See you around, okay?

368
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:36,896
Excuse me, sir,
what are you doing there?

369
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,814
I said, whatcha doin'?

370
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,732
Watching the children.

371
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:43,417
Uh-huh. Let me have some I.D., sir.

372
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:45,912
I... I was looking at the children.

373
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,501
Sir, turn around, put your
hands on the fence, please.

374
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,323
Why-why are you doing this?

375
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:53,105
Lean forward, put your hands
on the fence, please.

376
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,927
Turn around!

377
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,941
Hands on the fence.

378
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:58,571
What-what are you doing?

379
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,585
I'm taking your wallet
out of your back pocket

380
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:02,120
to check your identification, sir.

381
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:03,366
15-Adam to Central K,

382
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,860
I need a name check: Adam Raki.

383
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,778
- Robert-Adam...
- Is this the man you reported?

384
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:09,697
I wasn't the one who saw him.

385
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,327
Where do you live, sir?

386
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:13,341
Please stay where you are.

387
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:16,315
Do you live or do you have business
in this neighborhood, sir?

388
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,465
Everything's fine.

389
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,904
Go on back inside.

390
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,028
Beth?

391
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,850
Are you the one that
reported this?

392
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,576
Adam! What's going on?

393
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,111
You know this man?

394
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,645
Yeah, he's my neighbor.

395
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:31,084
What happened?

396
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,811
15-Adam - Raki,

397
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:35,017
- R-A-K-I. No hits.
- He's clean.

398
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:37,223
All right. Sorry about that.

399
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,812
Can't be too careful
with kids, right?

400
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,922
You can go.

401
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,019
Adam!

402
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,092
Adam?

403
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:17,695
Enough with the presents, okay?

404
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,916
Well, that was kind of
awful, wasn't it? I mean...

405
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:26,040
God, you just stopped by to watch
the kids. I do that for a living.

406
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,575
Police freak me out, too, okay?

407
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,781
Do you want to come in?

408
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,754
Okay.

409
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,921
So you live alone?

410
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:52,510
Yes.

411
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:55,675
I mean, it's...
it's big for one person.

412
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,552
For the city.

413
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:00,566
Well, my father lived here, too.

414
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,580
Oh!
Where is he now?

415
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:04,547
- Queens.
- Queens?

416
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,896
Oh, he died six weeks ago.

417
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:08,431
Oh, God!

418
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:10,062
I'm so sorry.

419
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:13,898
My friend Harlan says Queens is
where everybody goes to die,

420
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,104
because they can't
tell the difference.

421
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,132
That's... that's awful.

422
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:23,201
Well, Harlan said it was a joke.

423
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:26,078
Oh, I meant about your father.

424
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,188
Oh.

425
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,448
What about your mother?

426
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,518
She died when I was eight.

427
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:38,259
I'm so sorry.

428
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:46,123
I had a really nice time
last night, in the park.

429
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:50,055
Were you excited?

430
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,589
What?

431
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:53,603
Sexually, when we
were in the park.

432
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:59,742
Uh, no, not exactly.

433
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,756
Well, I ask because I was,

434
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,866
and I wondered if you were, too.

435
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,333
Thank you so much
for the glass of water.

436
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:12,593
I... I should...
I should be going now.

437
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,799
Because I said that thing
about being sexually excited?

438
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:17,101
No... no, no.
I just...

439
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:19,499
Well... yeah.

440
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,158
Uh, sometimes it's hard
for me to, um...

441
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:28,227
...I have this thing

442
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:30,241
that makes it hard to, um...

443
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,830
It's called Asperger's syndrome.

444
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,189
One thing about
it is not knowing

445
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,586
what people are thinking.

446
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,368
Like right now.

447
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:49,518
Oh, right.

448
00:29:49,614 --> 00:29:51,532
I guess I was...

449
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:55,081
wondering what that
feels like for you.

450
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:57,383
Well... Well, it doesn't
feel like anything.

451
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,342
It just is.

452
00:29:58,438 --> 00:30:00,643
Okay.

453
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:04,000
My brain works differently from NTs.

454
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,302
NTs?

455
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,125
Neurotypicals.

456
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,235
Um, sometimes I can't
understand them.

457
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,345
Especially when they mean
something different

458
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,167
from what they're
actually saying.

459
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,605
You don't do that?

460
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,811
No, most aspies are really honest.

461
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,592
Psychologists think it's
a lack of imagination,

462
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,278
but psychologists are mostly NTs.

463
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,292
Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson,

464
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,593
Mozart, they all had
lots of imagination.

465
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,991
They had Asperger's?

466
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,294
Probably.

467
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,226
When I was younger,

468
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:38,432
I would've just thought
you were sexually excited

469
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:39,582
because I was.

470
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:42,364
That's called "mind blindness. "

471
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,624
I had to learn to ask what
other people are thinking.

472
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,652
I understand.

473
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,584
It's okay.

474
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,695
Oh.

475
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,805
I really... I really should go.

476
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,066
Okay.

477
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:06,724
I'm really sorry about your father.

478
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,738
Oh.

479
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,520
Can I see you again?

480
00:31:11,615 --> 00:31:16,507
Um... well, I'm...
I'm right upstairs, so...

481
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,137
Great. Okay.

482
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,248
I'll see you.

483
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,673
Hey.

484
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:36,168
- Do you have a minute?
- Oh, hi, Beth.

485
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:37,319
Sure, come on in.

486
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:39,045
Thank you.

487
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:41,539
You think it's a bad sign

488
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,841
when the description of a
school bores its director?

489
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,787
What do you know about
Asperger's syndrome?

490
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:51,801
Oh.

491
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,815
Well, it's a developmental disorder.

492
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,309
Kind of a high-functioning autism.

493
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,419
What does that mean exactly?

494
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:00,433
Well, there's a broad range.

495
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:02,063
It could be hard to tell.

496
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,324
Could be severe social
interaction problems.

497
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,832
Maybe I should get in on this;
interview the child and we can get some...

498
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,846
Oh, no, no, it's my neighbor.

499
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,668
He has it.

500
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:16,737
But he's really, really sweet,

501
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,710
and kind of interesting.

502
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:21,533
Yeah, sometimes

503
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:24,314
they can be quite brilliant.

504
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,903
It is on the autism spectrum.

505
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,069
Oh, you know, actually,
I think I have a...

506
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,522
This is a first-person account...

507
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,056
<i>Pretending To Be Normal.</i>

508
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:38,221
Oh, no, it's-it's not...
it's not serious.

509
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,468
Thank you.

510
00:32:39,564 --> 00:32:42,057
Okay. Sure.

511
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:44,359
Oh, Beth, would you just
take a look at this

512
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,277
- ... for me, please?
- Sure.

513
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:48,483
So, you're saying, really,

514
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:51,743
that he's not prime
relationship material,

515
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,757
right?

516
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:54,909
Um...

517
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,635
Not really.

518
00:32:56,731 --> 00:32:57,595
- Well...
- No.

519
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,841
Well, it...

520
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,855
It's...

521
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,500
Thanks.

522
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,514
So, um,

523
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,199
subtracting your
father's liabilities...

524
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,980
uh, credit card debt,
funeral cost fees,

525
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:15,049
etcetera... from his assets,
reduces

526
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:19,845
the, uh, the estate roughly $25,000.

527
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:23,394
And, uh, he bequeathed $5,000

528
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,271
to The Kids At Risk,
uh, music fund.

529
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,148
$10,000 to you, Mr. Keyes.

530
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:30,587
Oh.

531
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:33,560
So, as his primary beneficiary, Adam,

532
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:37,492
Adam, uh, you inherit
the remainder.

533
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:40,081
That would be the, the death
benefit from Juilliard

534
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,863
and the funds from
the TIAA retirement plan.

535
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,645
Also, there's approximately

536
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,042
$300,000 worth of equity
in the apartment.

537
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,919
So, assuming you sell
after closing fees

538
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,837
- ... and taxes, etcetera...
- Sell what?

539
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,290
We presumed that you'd be
moving to a smaller place.

540
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:58,304
Move?

541
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,085
Well, uh, with... without
your father's income

542
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:02,428
the mortgage payments are...

543
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:03,675
I don't want to move.

544
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,306
Easy.

545
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:06,744
Think of it as an opportunity.

546
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,854
You might want to
try a different city.

547
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,019
Uh, Mr. Wardlow,

548
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:15,855
Adam has never been out
of the city alone in his life.

549
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:18,924
Well, uh, closer to home than.

550
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,555
With the income from your job...

551
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:23,144
I don't have a job.
I was fired from my job.

552
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,733
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

553
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,843
Well, that makes the equity
in the apartment even more

554
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:29,475
- ... valuable.
- Changes like this are hard.

555
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,201
- It's my house. I won't
sell my house. - Adam!

556
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:33,407
- Mr. Raki... - Go away.
You're hurting my ears.

557
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,325
- And I'm not gonna sell my house.
- You need to calm down.

558
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:36,955
- I'm not selling my house!
- Adam,

559
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:39,353
cross your arms over your chest.

560
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,450
Mr. Wardlow, are we done?

561
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,327
There are papers to be signed.

562
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:50,861
Can you send them?

563
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:52,300
They need to be notar...

564
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:56,041
Yes, yes, yes, we, uh...
we can do that.

565
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,247
Come on, Adam.

566
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,686
Let's go.

567
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:03,426
I... I can't.

568
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:05,919
I... I can't move...

569
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:07,550
All right.

570
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,564
Come on.

571
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,797
You're not ten years old anymore.

572
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,004
You need a job.

573
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,826
I'm fired.

574
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:21,169
So what?

575
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:23,663
You know how many times
I've been fired?

576
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:26,444
When your dad and I came
back from the service,

577
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,074
I might as well have had

578
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,321
a three-day week.

579
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:31,431
Day one, I hate the freaking job.

580
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,541
Day two, I hate the freaking boss.

581
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:35,171
Day three, I hit someone,

582
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,897
and I got to start all over.

583
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:38,144
I didn't hit anyone.

584
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,158
I never hit anyone.

585
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:42,844
Adam,

586
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,667
you're 29 years old,

587
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:48,599
and you can't pay your mortgage
without finding a job.

588
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:51,572
So what are you going to do?

589
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,758
<i>Hey, Bethie-boo,
just wanted</i>

590
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:33,388
<i>to make sure you
got home okay.</i>

591
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,018
<i>You home okay? Call us.</i>

592
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,320
<i>Beth, are you there?</i>

593
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,759
<i>Look, maybe the
whole point was</i>

594
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:41,252
<i>for me to find out what an
amazing thing we have.</i>

595
00:36:41,348 --> 00:36:43,746
<i>You're not really
gonna throw this away...?</i>

596
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,489
Adam? Wha...?

597
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,599
What?

598
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:07,339
Get in here!

599
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,438
Wait. What?

600
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,452
What in the world

601
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:24,795
were you doing out there?

602
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,521
You... You could have been killed.

603
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:28,439
How were you gonna get down?

604
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:29,973
Climb up.

605
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:31,316
Climb?

606
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:33,618
It's rated for 3,000 pounds.

607
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:36,111
You said you couldn't see
out of your windows.

608
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:50,498
Why did you scream like that?

609
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:52,224
Because I walked
into my apartment,

610
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,526
and there was this strange
man in my window.

611
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:55,964
It was me!

612
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,787
But I didn't know that.

613
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,968
I guess not.

614
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,188
Thank you for trying to...

615
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,298
You're welcome.

616
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:25,408
Would you, um...?

617
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,423
Would you like some tea?

618
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:31,930
Uh, sure.

619
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,273
Okay.

620
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:40,658
Harlan said I should send
out application letters

621
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:43,247
and... and worry about
the interviews later.

622
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:44,590
Interviews?

623
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,563
Interviews usually
don't go very well.

624
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,728
But you put in

625
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:51,975
some applications?

626
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,222
Eighty-seven.

627
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:54,565
Eighty-seven?

628
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:57,442
Mm-hmm. Oh, applications
and letters of inquiry.

629
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:00,031
You applied for 87 jobs.

630
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,854
Including the letters of inquiry.

631
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:03,100
Today?

632
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:06,745
Wow.

633
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:09,238
Wow?

634
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:11,828
I mean... that's a lot.

635
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:14,129
Well, I don't want to move.

636
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,103
Yeah.

637
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,282
This is very good-smelling tea.

638
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:24,584
English breakfast.

639
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,749
My father calls it coffee
without the bad breath.

640
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:49,520
Uh, maybe I should go.

641
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:52,205
- I'm...
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

642
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:54,219
Sorry? You're s...?

643
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:55,370
A little upset.

644
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,617
Oh.

645
00:39:56,713 --> 00:40:00,453
My father's... an accountant,

646
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:03,235
and he's been accused of
doing something illegal.

647
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,345
Oh. Did he do it?

648
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:08,894
No, no, but tonight,
he said it looks like

649
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,771
he will probably
have to go on trial.

650
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,223
And I know your father
just passed away,

651
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:16,662
so I shouldn't

652
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:19,731
even...

653
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:28,843
Um...

654
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,693
I... I can see that you're upset,

655
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:38,625
but... I don't know what to do.

656
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:49,462
Could you give me a hug?

657
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:52,724
Yes.

658
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:57,231
Adam, I'd like you to give me a hug.

659
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:12,001
<i>'But he's naked!'</i>

660
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,151
<i>cried a little boy.</i>

661
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,399
<i>All the people whispered
among each other.</i>

662
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,509
<i>'He's naked!
There's a little boy</i>

663
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:19,194
<i>'who says the
king is naked. '</i>

664
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,688
<i>The king shivered, for he was
sure that the boy was right,</i>

665
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:25,236
<i>but he thought, 'I must bear it
until the procession is over. '</i>

666
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:30,164
<i>And he walked even more proudly
all the way back to the palace. "</i>

667
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:35,402
So, what do we think?

668
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,896
He was naked.

669
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:42,404
Ran around the whole
town naked.

670
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,569
Yes. Okay, he was naked.

671
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:46,720
Anything else?

672
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:48,926
The little boy was bad.

673
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:51,227
Really? Why do you
say that, Stephanie?

674
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:52,858
- Because he told.
- That's dumb.

675
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:54,584
Bruce...

676
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,023
But he was naked!

677
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:59,379
Don't you think the king needed
to know that he was naked?

678
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,626
Well,

679
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:02,449
he didn't have to yell it out.

680
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,559
He could have just
gone over to him

681
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,093
and whispered it in his ear.

682
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:08,203
Everybody else
was just lying

683
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:09,834
so nobody'd think
they were stupid

684
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,382
and because they were afraid
of seeing the king's weenie.

685
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:16,455
- Weenie!
- Weenie!

686
00:42:17,698 --> 00:42:19,712
I like the boy.

687
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:24,603
I do, too.

688
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,607
Maybe we should go.

689
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:47,717
Our table's next.

690
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:52,417
Can't eat macaroni and
cheese every night.

691
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:54,815
Why not?

692
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,021
Because it's a meager life.

693
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,363
It lacks stimulation.

694
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:02,487
Thanks for coming.

695
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,117
I... I know it's hard.

696
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:07,186
Okay.

697
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,587
This is better, right?

698
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:26,560
Hello. I'm Rom, with an M.

699
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,958
I see you have drinks.
Would you like a wine list,

700
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:31,451
or may I describe the specials?

701
00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:32,698
It's all right.

702
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:34,328
Um, we know what we'd like.

703
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:36,150
We'll take two tricolored salads,

704
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,220
one grilled salmon on lentils
with roasted potatoes,

705
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,098
and a penne Alfredo.

706
00:43:42,193 --> 00:43:44,016
And Ron...?

707
00:43:44,112 --> 00:43:45,071
It's Rom-uh.

708
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,509
Sorry. Rom.

709
00:43:46,605 --> 00:43:48,427
Could we get that all to go?

710
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:02,047
It's macaroni and cheese.

711
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,924
When in "Rom"...

712
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,225
What?

713
00:44:07,321 --> 00:44:08,952
How's the job hunt going?

714
00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:12,212
Mm, a lot of them
were already taken.

715
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,514
I'm still getting responses,
though.

716
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,487
I'm sure the right thing
will come along.

717
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,501
How can you be sure of that?

718
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:22,858
I mean, I hope the right
thing comes along.

719
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:24,969
Oh.

720
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,572
My dad and I came out here

721
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,161
to watch Hale-Bopp for
five nights in a row.

722
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,669
Voyager 2 will pass
within 4.3 light years

723
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:40,601
of Sirius, the Dog Star in
approximately 196,000 years.

724
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,711
I brought you something.

725
00:44:46,355 --> 00:44:48,946
Oh. Are there supposed
to be presents?

726
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:52,590
No, no, this is a spur
of the moment kind of thing.

727
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:54,604
Oh.

728
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,578
<i>How to Find Work That
Works for People</i>

729
00:45:04,674 --> 00:45:06,400
<i>with Asper...</i>

730
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:13,306
I thought it might be helpful.

731
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,334
Are you offended?

732
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:22,225
No.

733
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:25,774
'Cause I was just trying to help.

734
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:57,999
Thank you.

735
00:45:58,095 --> 00:46:00,013
You're welcome.

736
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:10,947
Try to be careful.

737
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:14,783
I had my heart broken
by a big jerk recently.

738
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:20,441
I need time to take
things slowly.

739
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:25,333
What did he do?

740
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:29,361
While we were together,
he slept with other women.

741
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:37,897
Not together together

742
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:41,637
but while we were
in the relationship.

743
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,651
Oh.

744
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:51,612
So I need to take
things slowly.

745
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:55,544
- No sex.
- Right.

746
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,599
- Kissing?
- Yes.

747
00:46:56,695 --> 00:46:58,325
- Holding?
- Yes.

748
00:46:58,421 --> 00:47:00,339
No sex.

749
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:02,737
Is that all right?

750
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,491
Yes.

751
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:15,589
It's only been a month.

752
00:47:15,685 --> 00:47:17,699
How long it should be
before you meet Adam

753
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:19,713
is not written in Scripture, Daddy.

754
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:22,302
You just... you made that up.

755
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,632
Don't worry about me; I'm fine.

756
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:35,730
Has there been any more news
on the, on the court...?

757
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:38,032
Okay.

758
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:40,717
Okay, sure.

759
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:43,402
I will, I'll tell him.

760
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:44,361
Okay.

761
00:47:44,457 --> 00:47:45,416
I love you, Daddy.

762
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:47,814
Bye.

763
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,348
<i>You can stay for an hour.</i>

764
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:51,171
You might even have fun.

765
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,281
I'd have fun at home.

766
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:57,309
It's not the gates of Hell,
Adam, it's my friends.

767
00:47:59,322 --> 00:48:01,242
You look great.

768
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,680
You've got to meet the baby.

769
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:05,941
Her name is Lin Yao, which means
"beautiful jade treasure. "

770
00:48:06,037 --> 00:48:07,955
That's beautiful.

771
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,914
Don't you think?

772
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,024
I mean, really,
she is young enough.

773
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,079
We could call her anything.

774
00:48:12,175 --> 00:48:13,326
Her name is Lin Yao.

775
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,860
That's what I said.

776
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:16,970
- That's who she was when
we got her. - Yeah.

777
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:18,025
Oh, she's asleep.

778
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,176
I know, look at her.

779
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,477
Yeah, she is.

780
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:23,204
We have a video, of course.

781
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,698
Would you... would you
like to see the video?

782
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:27,233
No, thank you.

783
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:28,767
Where is the bathroom?

784
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:33,179
Down the hall, second right.

785
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,700
I'd love to see the video.

786
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,139
Oh, so now you're an expert.

787
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:42,385
Oh, come on.

788
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:45,263
Tory, y-you don't have
to know a lot about Islam

789
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,483
to understand hunger or,
or anger or desperation.

790
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:52,648
We don't understand who these
people are, h-how they think.

791
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:54,662
I don't understand people
from New Jersey.

792
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:56,964
Look, either you believe

793
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,033
that human beings share
some basic similarities

794
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:02,239
or you just throw the towel in.

795
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:04,157
Buying a telescope is
a complicated decision.

796
00:49:04,253 --> 00:49:05,499
You should focus
on your interests.

797
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:07,705
No pun intended.

798
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,240
What?

799
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:10,870
"Focus"?

800
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:12,214
Right. A-Are you interested

801
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,036
in the solar system,
moon, planets,

802
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:16,433
etcetera, or deeper
space - nebulae,

803
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:18,064
star clusters, galaxies?

804
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,420
Then you want a much larger
lens with a Dobsonian mount.

805
00:49:21,516 --> 00:49:23,530
Uh, the apo refractors go
up to 180 millimeters.

806
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:24,969
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

807
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,038
Michael's looking for a telescope
to buy for her cottage in Kerhonkson.

808
00:49:28,134 --> 00:49:30,340
For deep space, in a static
position, you can really think

809
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:33,025
about some bigger
reflectors and...

810
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,684
Have, have you heard too
much about telescopes?

811
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,561
No, no... just some
of what you're saying

812
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:43,671
is going right over my head.

813
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,124
Oh, okay, well, I'll start over.

814
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,001
Three basic considerations:
Kind of lens...

815
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:52,494
Come and say good-bye
to Robin and Jen with me.

816
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:56,618
All right.

817
00:49:57,673 --> 00:49:59,592
Uh, thank you for
the information.

818
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:02,086
Oh, you're welcome.
It's a very big decision.

819
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:03,141
Nice to meet you, Michael.

820
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:05,251
And you.

821
00:50:08,415 --> 00:50:10,621
Wow.

822
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:14,649
I remember the other kids
chattering away before school

823
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,581
or at parties whispering
to one another,

824
00:50:18,677 --> 00:50:22,706
and I'd always wonder what
they were talking about.

825
00:50:23,761 --> 00:50:26,446
Looked so easy.

826
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,652
One, then the other.

827
00:50:28,748 --> 00:50:33,735
Laugh, laugh, laugh,
new topic, start again.

828
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:38,722
I started outlining
my new book.

829
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:40,161
Really excited.

830
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:42,271
That's good.

831
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,764
You're going to be the
first person I thank

832
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,067
in my Newbery Award speech.

833
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:48,889
It's an award for
children's book...

834
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:51,191
No, I know what a
Newbery Award is.

835
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:56,370
Are you still going
to make them talk?

836
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,439
They're going to be a
typical New York family

837
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:02,603
except they live in the
park and they're raccoons.

838
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:09,413
Okay, your turn.

839
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,141
I think the father is going
to be in advertising.

840
00:51:23,224 --> 00:51:25,142
Instead of making stuff up,

841
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:29,553
why couldn't you write
about the real raccoons?

842
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:32,622
Because it's a children's
book, not a nature book.

843
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:35,117
Well, I'd probably like
the nature book better.

844
00:51:37,419 --> 00:51:39,912
Yeah, you probably would.

845
00:51:49,598 --> 00:51:52,571
Well, I didn't mean...

846
00:52:06,383 --> 00:52:08,972
This is what I meant.

847
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,003
Do you, um...

848
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:29,113
do you want sex?

849
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:33,429
I think I do.

850
00:52:37,744 --> 00:52:39,758
You...

851
00:52:40,813 --> 00:52:43,499
You said you needed time.

852
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:49,829
Well, then, take it very,
very slowly.

853
00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:55,621
This isn't fair.

854
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:56,676
What's fair?

855
00:53:56,772 --> 00:53:58,500
It's a small manipulation.

856
00:53:58,595 --> 00:53:59,938
What, you aren't curious?

857
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:02,048
Of course, but if he isn't
ready to meet us...

858
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:03,583
Yeah, well, sometimes you've got

859
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:05,405
to give "ready" a little push.

860
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:07,706
- Beth.
- Honey!

861
00:54:07,802 --> 00:54:10,488
Daddy, Mom, what...?

862
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:11,734
What are you doing here?

863
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,173
We're seeing the play.

864
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:14,899
- But I thought you...
- What?

865
00:54:14,995 --> 00:54:16,050
Hi, honey.

866
00:54:16,146 --> 00:54:18,448
I thought we had your tickets.

867
00:54:18,544 --> 00:54:19,886
No, we were going
with the Pierces,

868
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:21,518
and they couldn't make it.

869
00:54:21,613 --> 00:54:23,819
Come on, we're not ogres,
at least Becky isn't.

870
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:25,162
This is Beth's mother Rebecca.

871
00:54:25,258 --> 00:54:26,409
I'm Marty.

872
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:27,655
We've heard so much about you.

873
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:28,998
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah.

874
00:54:29,094 --> 00:54:30,628
Lovely to meet you, Adam.

875
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:32,451
Uh... thank you.

876
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:35,232
Me and my little girl,
we are thick as thieves.

877
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:36,575
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

878
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:39,260
I just couldn't wait any longer.

879
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:40,890
We rarely go Off-Broadway.

880
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,192
I didn't even know this
theater still existed.

881
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:45,878
The Cherry Lane Theater is

882
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:50,098
the oldest continuously running
theater Off-Broadway.

883
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:52,975
It was converted from a
box factory in 1924, and,

884
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:55,181
and then in the
'20s and '30s and '40s,

885
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:58,250
it presented the work of writers
such as F. Scott Fitzgerald,

886
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:00,552
John Dos Passos, Eugene O'Neill...

887
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,621
I used to bone up on conversation
topics, too, when I had a date.

888
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:06,775
- Marty. - Ask Becky.
- From 19... from 1951 to 1953,

889
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,056
Julian Beck and Judith Malina's
Living Theatre was based here.

890
00:55:10,091 --> 00:55:11,294
Oh, oh, and in 1952,

891
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,075
Judith Malina chased a fire
marshal down the street

892
00:55:14,171 --> 00:55:16,952
with a spear from her
production of 'Ubu Roi'.

893
00:55:17,432 --> 00:55:21,460
'Endgame' by Samuel Beckett had
its American premiere here in 1957,

894
00:55:21,556 --> 00:55:25,104
followed by other new works such
as 'Happy Days', also by Beckett,

895
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,228
in 1962, 'Dutchman' in
1964 by LeRoi Jones,

896
00:55:29,324 --> 00:55:34,120
'The Happy Journey to Trenton and
Camden' by Thornton Wilder in 196...

897
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,874
B... But that... that's enough
about the Cherry Lane Theater.

898
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,176
W... What about the '70s?

899
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,765
Well, in 1971 'Godspell'
opened, and in 197...

900
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:47,259
Adam, Daddy's joking.

901
00:55:47,355 --> 00:55:48,985
Oh, oh.

902
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:52,246
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, that's okay. - No, no,

903
00:55:52,342 --> 00:55:53,684
history is always very interesting.

904
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,835
Please take your seats.

905
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:57,330
Come on, in we go.

906
00:55:57,426 --> 00:55:59,536
Shall we?

907
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:11,811
Oh, they're dying to go to trial.

908
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:13,538
They'll get their pictures
in the paper.

909
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:14,880
It's written all over them.

910
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:16,607
What does Mr. Beranbaum say?

911
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:18,621
He's a lawyer;
he's paid to worry.

912
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:21,882
Bottom line: if defense
pushes all the way to trial,

913
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,321
we settle, right?

914
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,143
He's sure they'll settle.

915
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:26,965
That's why you don't
have to be there.

916
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:29,267
You said it would help if
we showed our support.

917
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:31,185
You had to tell her that.

918
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:33,103
Your father is right;
you have work.

919
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,733
Mom, I'm covered at work.

920
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,747
I'm coming. I need
to be there for you.

921
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,953
What are you accused of,
Mr. Buchwald?

922
00:56:46,147 --> 00:56:48,257
I'm accused of trying
to help a friend.

923
00:56:48,353 --> 00:56:49,600
That's what I'm accused of.

924
00:56:49,696 --> 00:56:51,901
Beth's uncle Eric...

925
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:52,956
Eric Cooper.

926
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,258
...made his daughter Jennifer
CFO of his company.

927
00:56:55,354 --> 00:56:56,409
But she's qualified, right?

928
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:57,847
I mean, she went to Wharton.

929
00:56:57,943 --> 00:56:59,382
Yes, she's qualified.

930
00:56:59,478 --> 00:57:01,012
Uncle Eric's not really my uncle.

931
00:57:01,108 --> 00:57:03,793
He's an old friend of Daddy's,
and Jennifer is his daughter.

932
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:06,383
She's young, she made a few
mistakes. I carried them over

933
00:57:06,479 --> 00:57:08,781
from one year to the next,
made it look a little better

934
00:57:08,877 --> 00:57:10,220
even to her own father.

935
00:57:10,316 --> 00:57:13,385
It wasn't even a hard call to
make, but now they all think

936
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:14,536
they've uncovered Enron.

937
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,454
Could you go to jail?

938
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,796
Adam.

939
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,427
No.

940
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,345
I'm glad you asked.

941
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,702
Bethie,
I'm not going anywhere.

942
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:29,880
Any more questions,
Mr. Prosecutor?

943
00:57:29,976 --> 00:57:32,471
Uh, no.

944
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:35,827
See, he fits right in.

945
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:38,800
You put him on the spot,
confronted him, pushed him.

946
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,719
Well, I... I didn't understand
what he was saying.

947
00:57:40,814 --> 00:57:42,349
Well, maybe that's not his fault.

948
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:44,555
Monday he goes on trial,
in case you didn't get that.

949
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:46,377
You don't talk about
going to jail!

950
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:47,911
It seemed like the
important thing.

951
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,350
The important thing?!

952
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:50,980
All of a sudden,
you know what's important.

953
00:57:51,076 --> 00:57:53,666
You can't say two words on
how you feel about anything,

954
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,393
but you know what's
important to my family.

955
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:59,037
- I... I... I... - You know, my
father's not some criminal, okay?

956
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:01,914
- Okay.
- Just forget it.

957
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:02,969
Beth?

958
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:04,024
I'm going home.

959
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,326
Please don't follow me!

960
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,865
May I come in?

961
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:41,811
I'm sorry.

962
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:43,826
It's some chocolate.

963
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,800
I'm not Forrest Gump, you know.

964
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:50,540
Of course not, I didn't eve...

965
00:58:50,636 --> 00:58:51,978
Was that a joke?

966
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:53,129
Are you joking?

967
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:54,760
I can joke.

968
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,828
I'm sorry.

969
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:00,034
I...

970
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,761
I took it out on you.

971
00:59:01,856 --> 00:59:04,350
I'm just...
just scared for my father.

972
00:59:11,736 --> 00:59:12,982
You can apologize,

973
00:59:13,078 --> 00:59:14,517
too, you know?

974
00:59:14,613 --> 00:59:16,243
You said it was your fault.

975
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,038
I got an interview.

976
00:59:21,997 --> 00:59:23,148
You did?

977
00:59:23,244 --> 00:59:24,587
Halloran Industries,

978
00:59:24,683 --> 00:59:27,176
research and engineering
for space communication

979
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,711
and exploration.

980
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:31,301
Adam, that's...
that's perfect!

981
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:32,356
Break out the chocolate.

982
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,890
Let's go get some champagne.

983
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:35,713
No, it's just an interview.

984
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:37,631
There's a saying in my family:

985
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:40,508
"It's never too early
to drink the champagne. "

986
00:59:50,578 --> 00:59:52,592
You'd be good at the job, right?

987
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:55,182
So all you got to do
is let them know it.

988
00:59:55,278 --> 00:59:57,196
That's all? That's impossible.

989
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:59,018
When is it?

990
00:59:59,114 --> 01:00:01,895
February 3rd. 17 days.

991
01:00:01,991 --> 01:00:03,622
All right, so that's
how long you got.

992
01:00:03,718 --> 01:00:05,444
You got to learn
it during the day,

993
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,746
and then I'll help you at night.

994
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:09,856
They'll think I'm a freak.

995
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,061
Fine.

996
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:14,363
Whatever you say.

997
01:00:15,143 --> 01:00:16,292
Beth?

998
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:18,747
Beth?

999
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:24,818
Good one.

1000
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:38,436
<i>In most interview situations,</i>

1001
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:41,313
<i>the greeting is done
in the standing position.</i>

1002
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:42,944
<i>Simple greeting:</i>

1003
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,958
<i>"Hello, nice to meet you. "</i>

1004
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:46,493
<i>Basic greeting:</i>

1005
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:48,123
<i>"Hello, my name is Jason.</i>

1006
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:49,466
<i>Nice to meet you. "</i>

1007
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,151
Mr. Buchwald,
how do you plead?

1008
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:54,069
Not guilty, Your Honor.

1009
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:55,987
<i>Involved greeting:</i>

1010
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,810
<i>"Hello, you must
be Miss Austen.</i>

1011
01:00:57,906 --> 01:00:58,865
<i>My name is Jason.</i>

1012
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,303
<i>Nice to meet you. "</i>

1013
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:02,413
Mr. Raki?

1014
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:08,264
I'm Elizabeth Buchwald.

1015
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,415
I'll be interviewing you

1016
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:11,237
for the job we discussed
over the phone.

1017
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,059
Phone?

1018
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,306
"Nice to meet you"?

1019
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:16,032
Oh, oh, right, right.

1020
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:17,950
Eyes.

1021
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:20,444
Please, step into my office.

1022
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,458
<i>Make it a goal
of your interview</i>

1023
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,815
<i>to mention each of your
strengths at least once.</i>

1024
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:29,267
The items, uh, listed as assets
are really expenses,

1025
01:01:29,363 --> 01:01:30,994
covered up in order to increase

1026
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,008
the earning statement
of the company.

1027
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,681
<i>Eye contact.</i>

1028
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:43,174
<i>One way to get around
poor eye contact dilemma</i>

1029
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,723
<i>is to have the candidate look
at the interviewer's forehead.</i>

1030
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:49,216
<i>Practice is needed, however,</i>

1031
01:01:49,312 --> 01:01:51,038
<i>because it will still
require an effort</i>

1032
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:53,917
<i>to remember to
look at a forehead.</i>

1033
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:01,972
Beth?

1034
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:03,123
No.

1035
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,850
Just once more, please.

1036
01:02:04,946 --> 01:02:06,864
Adam, can't you think
about anyone

1037
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:09,453
but yourself,
even for a minute?

1038
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:10,796
I'm sorry.

1039
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:12,042
No, I...

1040
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:14,248
Okay.

1041
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:18,277
Tell me something
about your previous

1042
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:20,483
work experience, Mr. Raki.

1043
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:23,936
<i>At your last job,
how much of the work</i>

1044
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,662
<i>did you perform
independently?</i>

1045
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:27,100
<i>How much as a team?</i>

1046
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:30,361
Now, you've testified that your
relationship with the Cooper family

1047
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:33,142
is personal, as well as professional.
Isn't that right?

1048
01:02:33,238 --> 01:02:34,581
Yes.

1049
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,746
Eric Cooper and I have been
associated for over 30 years.

1050
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,760
He's become a close friend.

1051
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:40,719
But that doesn't mean...

1052
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:42,350
Would you tell the court a little

1053
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:45,899
about your relationship
with, uh, Jennifer Cooper?

1054
01:02:47,145 --> 01:02:48,968
She's a wonderful young woman.

1055
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:50,694
I have known her, her...

1056
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,132
her whole life.

1057
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:54,722
Isn't it true that you'd be eager

1058
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,407
to help Jennifer with any
problem she was having?

1059
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:58,750
Yes.

1060
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:01,819
- Out of your affection for
the family, of course. - Sure.

1061
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:04,024
Mr. Buchwald,
would you feel compelled

1062
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,286
to help Jennifer to preserve
your own reputation?

1063
01:03:07,382 --> 01:03:09,972
No.

1064
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:13,040
Did you have an affair
with Ms. Cooper in 2001?

1065
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:16,301
- Objection, Your Honor. - Mr. Buchwald
opened the door, Your Honor.

1066
01:03:16,397 --> 01:03:18,315
I understand the evidence,
counselor.

1067
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:19,658
Overruled.

1068
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,480
Please answer the question.

1069
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:26,467
Yes. Briefly.

1070
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:30,592
So, Jennifer had every
reason to believe that you

1071
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:32,318
would help her with
this problem.

1072
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:34,620
That had noth...

1073
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,127
The one...

1074
01:03:39,223 --> 01:03:42,100
had nothing to do
with the other.

1075
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:44,978
Nothing.

1076
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:57,638
<i>Somehow</i>

1077
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:03,009
<i>I'm leading
someone else's life</i>

1078
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:05,502
<i>I cut a star down</i>

1079
01:04:07,037 --> 01:04:09,530
<i>With my knife</i>

1080
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:16,052
<i>And right now</i>

1081
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:19,026
<i>I still see</i>

1082
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,135
<i>The way the moon</i>

1083
01:04:23,054 --> 01:04:26,218
<i>Plays this tune</i>

1084
01:04:26,314 --> 01:04:29,383
<i>Though our nights died</i>

1085
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:37,247
<i>My hands shake</i>

1086
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:41,852
<i>My knees quake</i>

1087
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:46,167
<i>It's every day</i>

1088
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:48,949
<i>Same way</i>

1089
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:51,346
<i>'Cause then came you</i>

1090
01:04:51,442 --> 01:04:53,744
<i>Then there's you</i>

1091
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,237
<i>I keep your picture</i>

1092
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,731
<i>In my worn-through shoes</i>

1093
01:04:58,827 --> 01:05:00,361
<i>Then there's you</i>

1094
01:05:00,457 --> 01:05:03,047
<i>Then came you</i>

1095
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:05,157
<i>When I'm lost</i>

1096
01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:08,130
<i>Look at my picture of you</i>

1097
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:21,557
<i>And somehow</i>

1098
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:25,777
<i>I'll make tonight our own</i>

1099
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:30,669
<i>Show you every way
I've grown</i>

1100
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:32,971
<i>Since I met you</i>

1101
01:05:35,272 --> 01:05:39,588
<i>And right now</i>

1102
01:05:39,684 --> 01:05:43,808
<i>I'll be the boy
in your next song</i>

1103
01:05:43,904 --> 01:05:48,891
<i>I'll learn the parts
and play along</i>

1104
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,865
<i>If you let me</i>

1105
01:05:55,797 --> 01:05:58,290
<i>My hands shake</i>

1106
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:00,208
All rise.

1107
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:05,004
<i>My knees quake</i>

1108
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,018
<i>It's every day</i>

1109
01:06:08,073 --> 01:06:09,415
Be seated.

1110
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,196
<i>The same way</i>

1111
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,210
<i>'Cause then came you</i>

1112
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:16,225
<i>Then there's you...</i>

1113
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:18,623
Mr. Raki.

1114
01:06:19,678 --> 01:06:21,212
Hello, you must be Doug Brandel.

1115
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:23,131
I'm Adam Raki.
Pleased to meet you.

1116
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:24,090
Come in.

1117
01:06:24,185 --> 01:06:26,008
<i>Then there's you</i>

1118
01:06:26,104 --> 01:06:28,022
<i>I keep your picture</i>

1119
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,899
<i>In my worn-through shoes</i>

1120
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:34,927
<i>When I'm lost in your eyes</i>

1121
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,708
<i>I see</i>

1122
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:40,202
<i>A way for me.</i>

1123
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,217
Beth?

1124
01:06:49,313 --> 01:06:51,040
Adam, is Beth there?

1125
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:52,958
No, she isn't.

1126
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:55,739
Marty pled guilty.

1127
01:06:55,835 --> 01:06:58,328
There's some discretion
in sentencing.

1128
01:06:58,424 --> 01:07:00,055
The... the hearing is tomorrow.

1129
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:01,493
We may have to
make statements,

1130
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:03,412
but she isn't answering her cell.

1131
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:05,522
I called the school, but they...
she wasn't there.

1132
01:07:05,618 --> 01:07:07,536
Uh, do you... do you know
when she'll be home?

1133
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:10,605
No, I thought... I was waiting.

1134
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:12,619
Adam, please, can-can
you check her calendar,

1135
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:14,537
see if there's any way
I can reach her?

1136
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,263
Okay.

1137
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,717
Never mind. Marty's coming.
I have to go.

1138
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:29,595
They-they-they're keeping him
overnight. Tell her to call me.

1139
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:32,568
Tell her to call me right away.

1140
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:46,954
Adam!

1141
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,255
I've been thinking about
you all afternoon.

1142
01:07:49,351 --> 01:07:50,598
How did it go?

1143
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:53,476
I forgot my phone.

1144
01:07:53,572 --> 01:07:55,394
How did the interview go?

1145
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,122
Okay, you're right.

1146
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:05,752
Right?

1147
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,629
My father and I arranged
for us to meet.

1148
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:10,547
You arranged...?

1149
01:08:11,698 --> 01:08:14,096
I knew they were going
to be at the theater.

1150
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:15,631
They really wanted to meet you.

1151
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:18,892
Now, will you please
tell me what happened?

1152
01:08:20,714 --> 01:08:22,440
You lied?

1153
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:25,701
A little.

1154
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,223
Fooled you!

1155
01:08:32,318 --> 01:08:33,757
Dumb Adam!
Dumb!

1156
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:35,004
Dumb! Dumb!

1157
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,826
Dumb! Dumb!
Dumb! Dumb!

1158
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:37,785
Dumb!

1159
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,129
Dumb!
Dumb Adam!

1160
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:41,143
Adam, I didn't...
I'm sorry.

1161
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:42,677
I...

1162
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:45,075
Adam, please, just calm down.

1163
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,568
No, I hate you! I hate you!

1164
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:49,966
I hope your father goes
to jail forever! I hate you!

1165
01:08:50,062 --> 01:08:51,980
What?

1166
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:53,514
He's guilty.

1167
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:55,624
Your mother called and
he's a liar like you,

1168
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,775
and he's going to jail.

1169
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:57,830
I hate you!

1170
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,858
You're a child, Adam.

1171
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,352
Fuck Asperger's,
you're a fucking child.

1172
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,943
You liar!

1173
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:31,015
A long time ago,
when I told Grandpa Morse

1174
01:09:31,111 --> 01:09:32,837
that I wanted to get married,

1175
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:35,810
he said Marty was great,

1176
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:38,879
but that he was an angles guy.

1177
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:40,989
What does that mean?

1178
01:09:41,085 --> 01:09:45,017
That he was a guy
who plays the angles...

1179
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:47,990
in business, love...

1180
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:50,964
He even said

1181
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,033
he might wind up
in jail someday.

1182
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,444
And I told him he didn't
understand Marty,

1183
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:02,281
and that even if he ended
up in jail for life

1184
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:04,678
I would never regret
marrying him.

1185
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,473
And I don't.

1186
01:10:14,174 --> 01:10:16,475
We have to help him now, Beth.

1187
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:21,942
Tell the judge who your
father is in your life.

1188
01:10:22,038 --> 01:10:25,011
Who he's always been.

1189
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:27,121
Whatever...

1190
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:32,875
...bad decisions he's made.

1191
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:41,699
Okay.

1192
01:10:43,425 --> 01:10:45,439
Okay, Mom.

1193
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,951
<i>I read that</i>

1194
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:13,540
planets are lined up across the sky

1195
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:17,185
like they haven't been
in 30,000 years.

1196
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:19,295
Uh-huh.

1197
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:24,282
You didn't get the job
you were going for?

1198
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:26,201
No.

1199
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:28,694
That why you so down?

1200
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,900
Hell, I lost more jobs than...

1201
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:33,106
No, Beth and I broke up.

1202
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:35,407
Oh.

1203
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:36,942
She lied.

1204
01:11:37,038 --> 01:11:38,956
She lied and I found out about it.

1205
01:11:39,052 --> 01:11:40,682
I can't trust her anymore.

1206
01:11:47,587 --> 01:11:49,602
These all seem fine.

1207
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:54,493
Now, before I went
into the service,

1208
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:57,946
I met a girl who made
me a promise.

1209
01:11:58,042 --> 01:11:59,960
When I came back,

1210
01:12:00,056 --> 01:12:02,453
she was right there
waiting for me.

1211
01:12:02,549 --> 01:12:06,002
But I found out she hadn't
quite kept the promise,

1212
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:09,454
so I put some things
in a bag and I left.

1213
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:12,427
Never spoke to her again.

1214
01:12:12,523 --> 01:12:15,497
Though, sometimes,
the wanting to is...

1215
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:17,895
was like a live animal clawing

1216
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:20,005
at my chest from the inside.

1217
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:22,786
35 years.

1218
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:25,855
She's the only picture
in my head

1219
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:29,308
can still stop me
in broad daylight

1220
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:32,185
and make me curse myself

1221
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,391
for a stubborn, old fool.

1222
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:40,625
It's not rocket science.

1223
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:43,023
I'm saying you need
to talk to the girl

1224
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,037
one more time, that's all.

1225
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:46,667
Oh...

1226
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:47,818
I don't know.

1227
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:50,791
Liars is all you're going
to run across

1228
01:12:50,887 --> 01:12:52,326
in this world.

1229
01:12:52,422 --> 01:12:56,641
A man has got to learn the difference
between just plain liars

1230
01:12:56,737 --> 01:12:59,710
and liars worth loving.

1231
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:08,055
Harlan, if you called that girl,

1232
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:09,877
couldn't you stop
cursing yourself

1233
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:11,220
for a stubborn, old fool...

1234
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:13,330
even if you still had to be old.

1235
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:24,359
Be seated.

1236
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:30,977
This court sentences you to a
prison term of five years:

1237
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,607
24 months to be served

1238
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:34,334
in a federal corrections institute,

1239
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,266
followed by three years
of mandatory probation.

1240
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:40,184
As per your plea agreement,

1241
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,102
you'll have one week
to settle your affairs.

1242
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:44,691
Report to the corrections
department

1243
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:48,144
Monday, February 9, at 9:00 a. m.

1244
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,255
Adjourned.

1245
01:13:57,448 --> 01:14:00,325
You have one new message.

1246
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:02,339
Adam, this is Rebecca.

1247
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:05,791
Marty was sentenced to
two years in prison today.

1248
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:08,381
Of course we're all very upset,

1249
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,066
but Beth...

1250
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:13,081
anyway, we're going
home to Westchester.

1251
01:14:13,177 --> 01:14:14,903
211 Richmond Road,
Bedford Hills.

1252
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:16,150
You have the number.

1253
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:19,027
I... I thought you should know
where she is.

1254
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:20,945
For months, all they wanted was

1255
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,671
for me to give them Eric Cooper.

1256
01:14:24,206 --> 01:14:26,124
"Do not go about
as a talebearer

1257
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,658
amongst your people. "

1258
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:30,248
At least I don't have
to pack, right, Becky?

1259
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:31,878
We always pack too much.

1260
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:34,468
This time, just a toothbrush.

1261
01:14:38,113 --> 01:14:40,127
Excuse me.

1262
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:44,443
Let's talk for a minute.

1263
01:15:06,406 --> 01:15:10,338
Oh, Bethie, Bethie.

1264
01:15:10,434 --> 01:15:13,311
Your mother's going
to need your help.

1265
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:15,421
Yeah, I know.

1266
01:15:18,969 --> 01:15:21,942
<i>Oh, there're things you do,
there're things you have to do,</i>

1267
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:25,396
<i>and you make your choices,</i>

1268
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:28,369
<i>you live with them.</i>

1269
01:15:28,465 --> 01:15:31,342
You and your mother will
never want for anything.

1270
01:15:31,438 --> 01:15:33,356
I made arrangements.

1271
01:15:33,452 --> 01:15:35,370
In two years, I'll be back home,

1272
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:37,959
and this will all be over.

1273
01:15:38,055 --> 01:15:41,603
One more thing... about Adam.

1274
01:15:45,152 --> 01:15:47,166
He's not for you.

1275
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:50,236
<i>It's not his fault,</i>

1276
01:15:50,332 --> 01:15:52,729
<i>but he's more
like your child</i>

1277
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:55,415
<i>than-than anything else.</i>

1278
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:58,196
<i>He'll never be the kind of man
that you can admire,</i>

1279
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,114
<i>that you can look up to.</i>

1280
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,895
<i>And it's not fair that he
should hope for something</i>

1281
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,334
<i>that's-that's-that's...</i>

1282
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,444
<i>impossible.</i>

1283
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:11,431
People with Asperger's
get married.

1284
01:16:11,528 --> 01:16:13,062
They have families...

1285
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:15,172
Married?

1286
01:16:16,131 --> 01:16:18,912
He lives in another world.

1287
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:21,981
You don't need to make that
kind of compromise, Beth.

1288
01:16:25,817 --> 01:16:27,544
Now, you know this
is the best thing.

1289
01:16:30,517 --> 01:16:33,490
You do know that, Bethany.

1290
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:45,191
<i>Something is said</i>

1291
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:47,780
<i>Sits in my head</i>

1292
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:49,794
<i>It's been there too long</i>

1293
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,480
<i>It's killing me slow</i>

1294
01:16:52,576 --> 01:16:54,494
<i>It's rolling around</i>

1295
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,850
<i>It's pushing me down</i>

1296
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,783
<i>It's keeping the good
part of me closed</i>

1297
01:17:01,879 --> 01:17:05,332
<i>Can't you see</i>

1298
01:17:07,346 --> 01:17:10,415
<i>When I find you</i>

1299
01:17:10,511 --> 01:17:12,429
<i>I'll find me</i>

1300
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:15,114
<i>Oh</i>

1301
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:17,128
<i>I need you to know</i>

1302
01:17:17,224 --> 01:17:21,156
<i>Today, I'll wait
for you always</i>

1303
01:17:21,252 --> 01:17:24,801
<i>Oh</i>

1304
01:17:24,897 --> 01:17:27,103
<i>I need you to know</i>

1305
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:31,611
<i>Today, I'll wait
for you always</i>

1306
01:17:31,706 --> 01:17:35,159
<i>'Cause when I find you</i>

1307
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:38,228
<i>I'll find me</i>

1308
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:07,959
<i>Can't you see</i>

1309
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:11,796
<i>That when I find you</i>

1310
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,714
<i>I'll find me</i>

1311
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:15,728
<i>Oh</i>

1312
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,606
<i>I need you to know</i>

1313
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:22,921
<i>Today, I'll wait
for you always</i>

1314
01:18:23,017 --> 01:18:25,894
<i>Oh</i>

1315
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:28,292
<i>I need you to know</i>

1316
01:18:28,388 --> 01:18:30,306
Beth?

1317
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:33,087
<i>I'll wait for you always
Beth Buchwald?</i>

1318
01:18:33,183 --> 01:18:35,294
<i>Oh...</i>

1319
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,541
Beth?

1320
01:18:36,637 --> 01:18:39,801
<i>I need you to know
today Beth Buchwald!</i>

1321
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:40,856
God.

1322
01:18:40,952 --> 01:18:43,350
<i>I'll wait for you always</i>

1323
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:46,035
<i>Oh...</i>

1324
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:47,282
I'll get him.

1325
01:18:47,378 --> 01:18:49,488
<i>I need you to know today
Beth?</i>

1326
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:51,022
<i>I'll wait for you always</i>

1327
01:18:51,118 --> 01:18:53,708
- Adam!
- Beth...

1328
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:57,831
<i>When I find you</i>

1329
01:18:58,983 --> 01:19:02,915
<i>When I find you.</i>

1330
01:19:04,546 --> 01:19:06,943
We... we have to talk again.

1331
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,533
You scared me.

1332
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:11,355
I thought you were
going to hit me.

1333
01:19:12,793 --> 01:19:14,807
I would never, ever do that.

1334
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:20,753
The job was gone.

1335
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:23,152
They hired someone for the job,

1336
01:19:23,248 --> 01:19:26,413
but they have another
one in an observatory.

1337
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:29,674
They said I was just
what they needed.

1338
01:19:29,769 --> 01:19:32,551
It starts in April, but it's
in Flintridge, California.

1339
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:35,811
I want you to come with me.

1340
01:19:35,907 --> 01:19:37,058
I could work,

1341
01:19:37,154 --> 01:19:39,744
and you could write,
and, uh, you wouldn't have

1342
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:40,798
to teach anymore.

1343
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:42,333
Uh, hello, Mr. Buchwald.

1344
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:44,059
I came... oh, um, I'm...

1345
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:45,690
I'm sorry you have
to go to prison.

1346
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:46,841
I came to ask Beth

1347
01:19:46,937 --> 01:19:48,568
to come to California with me.

1348
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:50,294
I'd be engineering microchips

1349
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,924
for satellite guidance systems.

1350
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,801
I have a job in Flintridge, California.

1351
01:19:54,897 --> 01:19:56,048
Uh, that's fine.

1352
01:19:56,144 --> 01:19:57,199
Congratulations, Adam,

1353
01:19:57,295 --> 01:19:59,021
but Beth won't be
able to go with you.

1354
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:00,652
What?

1355
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:02,474
The family needs her.
She's needed here.

1356
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,625
I need her.

1357
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:05,447
I... I can't go without her.

1358
01:20:05,543 --> 01:20:08,132
Well, I'm sorry, Adam,
but she can't go.

1359
01:20:08,228 --> 01:20:10,531
No... you can't do that.

1360
01:20:10,627 --> 01:20:12,353
- Bethie, Bethie, we...
- You can't speak for me.

1361
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:14,079
- We agreed. We agreed!
- You don't make my decisions.

1362
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:16,189
- We're standing in the middle
of the street. - I don't care!

1363
01:20:16,285 --> 01:20:19,354
- Calm down. Just calm down.
- You have choices, you liar! Cheater!

1364
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,272
Nothing will ever be
the same - nothing!

1365
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:22,806
- I'm going now with Adam,
- No, you're not!

1366
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,245
- ... and I don't care what
you think. - Don't go!

1367
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:26,163
- You can't go!
- Let go! Let go of me!

1368
01:20:26,259 --> 01:20:27,985
Get off of me!

1369
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:29,903
Adam!

1370
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:32,876
Adam!

1371
01:20:36,714 --> 01:20:38,248
You're coming to California?

1372
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:40,262
No, I mean home, to the city!

1373
01:20:40,358 --> 01:20:41,797
- You're not coming to California?
- Maybe!

1374
01:20:41,892 --> 01:20:43,235
I don't know.
I'll think about it!

1375
01:20:43,331 --> 01:20:44,290
- Okay.
- Mom!

1376
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:45,729
I'm going to take the car.

1377
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,647
- I'll leave it at the station.
- Beth!

1378
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:50,332
Come back here!

1379
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:38,190
It didn't go well?

1380
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:46,727
What did he say?

1381
01:21:46,823 --> 01:21:49,124
He wouldn't even see me.

1382
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:53,728
I waited in the visiting
room for an hour.

1383
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:55,262
And finally, a guard came

1384
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:58,043
and told me that he
wasn't coming out.

1385
01:21:59,578 --> 01:22:01,784
Your mother said
he wasn't ready.

1386
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:05,332
I thought if I actually went...

1387
01:22:05,428 --> 01:22:08,785
I didn't think that he
wouldn't even see me.

1388
01:22:10,512 --> 01:22:12,046
What are you going to do?

1389
01:22:12,142 --> 01:22:14,444
What do you mean?

1390
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,170
We're going, right?

1391
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:19,527
We're getting on a plane tomorrow
and going to California.

1392
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:24,226
You should pack. You
haven't packed at all.

1393
01:22:25,185 --> 01:22:26,720
Can you give me a minute?

1394
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,350
Okay?

1395
01:22:31,707 --> 01:22:34,681
Just leave me alone for a while.

1396
01:23:09,495 --> 01:23:10,838
I'm not sure.

1397
01:23:10,933 --> 01:23:14,386
I mean...
I should be sure, shouldn't I?

1398
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:16,784
Do you know what you want?

1399
01:23:18,222 --> 01:23:19,757
We'll never have a moment

1400
01:23:19,853 --> 01:23:23,402
where we look into each
other's eyes and know

1401
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,224
exactly...

1402
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,910
what the other person's feeling.

1403
01:23:29,828 --> 01:23:32,225
The idea of that wouldn't even
make sense to him.

1404
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:35,582
He's never told me
that he loves me.

1405
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:41,624
I don't know what it would
mean to him if he did.

1406
01:23:44,213 --> 01:23:50,064
Yes, feeling loved is
very important, but...

1407
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:54,476
loving, my precious girl...

1408
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:56,969
that's the necessity.

1409
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,107
Mom, I got to go.

1410
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:04,642
I... I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1411
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:06,176
Okay?

1412
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:11,740
I love you, Beth.

1413
01:24:14,905 --> 01:24:16,727
Adam,

1414
01:24:16,823 --> 01:24:20,659
why do you want me to go
to California with you?

1415
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,207
What... what do you mean?

1416
01:24:24,303 --> 01:24:26,988
Why do you want me to go?

1417
01:24:28,043 --> 01:24:30,825
Um...

1418
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:38,594
You, um...

1419
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:41,471
you are a...

1420
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,773
like a...

1421
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:45,595
part of me.

1422
01:24:50,582 --> 01:24:52,500
Um...

1423
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:57,584
And...

1424
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:01,612
And...

1425
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:04,489
I need you...

1426
01:25:04,585 --> 01:25:06,503
uh, to...

1427
01:25:09,284 --> 01:25:10,915
...to, uh...

1428
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,792
help find a place to live

1429
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:17,148
and to learn how to get to work

1430
01:25:17,244 --> 01:25:18,971
and to understand what it means

1431
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:21,273
when people say crazy stuff

1432
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:23,191
and...

1433
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:25,685
I couldn't go without you.

1434
01:25:36,906 --> 01:25:38,728
I'm sorry.

1435
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:44,195
I can't go.

1436
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:52,155
If you want me to go because...

1437
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:55,128
you can't go without me, I...

1438
01:25:57,238 --> 01:25:59,252
I can't go.

1439
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:49,259
You sure about this?

1440
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:50,602
I have to go.

1441
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,424
I have to go alone.

1442
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,110
Let me get that.

1443
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:02,015
Hey, uh, I want you to know,

1444
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,125
I made that call.

1445
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:12,277
It, uh, took me a
while to find her.

1446
01:28:14,004 --> 01:28:16,114
But we're...
we're going to meet up.

1447
01:28:18,511 --> 01:28:20,813
The woman's even more
stubborn than I am.

1448
01:28:24,457 --> 01:28:27,430
I'm just trying to say
thank you, damn it.

1449
01:28:29,444 --> 01:28:31,555
Oh, you're welcome, Harlan.

1450
01:29:01,382 --> 01:29:03,588
Actually, the best image
resolution is achieved

1451
01:29:03,684 --> 01:29:07,808
by multiple smaller telescopes
called interferometers.

1452
01:29:07,904 --> 01:29:10,301
Interferometers, uh,
combine light waves

1453
01:29:10,397 --> 01:29:12,315
collected from the same source.

1454
01:29:12,411 --> 01:29:14,521
Um, a star, for instance.

1455
01:29:14,617 --> 01:29:16,919
And the-the waves form
an interference pattern

1456
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:18,742
as they add together,
or cancel out,

1457
01:29:18,838 --> 01:29:20,085
add together, cancel out.

1458
01:29:20,181 --> 01:29:21,907
It's what we call
constructive interference,

1459
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:23,441
or destructive interference.

1460
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:27,277
So that the light from two or
more telescopes can produce, um,

1461
01:29:27,373 --> 01:29:30,538
a - a brighter image
than one alone.

1462
01:29:34,278 --> 01:29:40,033
But sometimes it's best just
to look up at the night sky.

1463
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,103
Thank you.

1464
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,829
Thank you so much, Mr. Raki.

1465
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:46,555
All right, we'll be heading out.

1466
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:48,665
Watch your step.

1467
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:53,556
Adam, the top one's for you.

1468
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,338
Oh, Carol?

1469
01:30:05,448 --> 01:30:07,751
Would you like me
to help you with those?

1470
01:30:07,847 --> 01:30:09,765
Yeah.

1471
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:13,313
Thank you.

1472
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:22,424

1473
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,438
Hello, Brian.

1474
