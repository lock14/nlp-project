不!
No!

找到了、找到了
There she is. There she is.

00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,800

9
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,363
各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,604
我至今已走遍北达克达州大半土地
I've traveled over half our state to be here tonight.

11
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,235
由于新油井的开凿，我来晚了点
I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in

12
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,248
我得去监督一下
at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it.

13
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,375
那口井现在日产两千桶油
That well is now flowing at 2,000 barrels

14
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,682
每周都给我带来五千美元进帐
and it's paying me an income of $5,000 a week.

15
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,655
我还在安特洛有16口量产油井
l have two others drilling and l have 16 producing at Antelope,

16
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,197
各位女士先生，若我说我是油商，你们也会同意
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if l say l'm an oilman, you will agree.

17
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,697
现在，你们有了绝佳的机会
Now, you have a great chance here,

18
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:08,705
但一不小心还是会赔光本钱
but bear in mind you could lose it all if you're not careful.

19
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,206
在所有凿井碰运气的人之中
Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots,

20
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,538
也许20个有1个能成为油商
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

21
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:15,874
剩下的都是投机客
The rest will be speculators,

22
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,471
所以才有人会介入你们和油商间
that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen

23
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:22,211
赚取那些原本应属于你们的钱
to get some of the money that ought, by rights, come to you.

24
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,255
就算你们找到的人有钱又想凿井
Even if you find one that has money and means to drill,

25
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,789
他也可能对于凿井一无所知
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

26
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,894
那样他就得雇请人手
He'll have to hire the job out on contract,

27
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,793
接着你们就得指望包工
and then you're depending on a contractor,

28
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,989
他的动作俐落纯熟
who'll rush the job through

29
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,192
找新工作就跟他的动作一样快
so he can get another contract just as quick as he can.

30
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:37,859
这一行就是这样
This is the way that this works.

31
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:41,234
你出多少？别浪费时间
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

32
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,529
请安静
Please!

33
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,677
我自己凿井
l do my own drilling.

34
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:52,215
我的手下就是我的手下，他们也是我熟识的人
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men l know.

35
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:56,048
我认真经营，也谨慎监督
l make it my business to be there and to see their work.

36
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:59,213
我不会乱扔工具，又到处乱找
l don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

37
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,517
我不会敲坏水泥
l don't botch the cementing off

38
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,186
让水流进洞里，搞砸整块地
and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease.

39
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,287
我是个爱家的人
l'm a family man.

40
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:11,027
我经营的是家族事业，这是我儿子兼伙伴，H.W.普兰优
l run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

41
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:16,837
少有油商能有如此家族伙伴关系
We offer you the bond of family that very few oilmen can understand.

42
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,870
在这一行，只有我是如此做事
l'm fixed like no other company in this field

43
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,174
因为我的灰狼坡油井已开始量产
and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

44
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,750
我有一组设备随时准备上线
l have a string of tools all ready to put to work.

45
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,013
一周内就能运送整组设备过来
l can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week.

46
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:33,182
钻油井的木头我有熟人会帮忙
l have business connections,
so l can get the lumber for the derricks.

47
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:37,088
时间这么赶，得靠朋友帮忙
Such things go by friendship in a rush like this.

48
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,062
因此我也敢保证能动手钻探
And this is why l can guarantee to start drilling

49
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,134
并提供现金来证明我说的话
and to put up the cash to back my word.

50
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,793
我向各位保证
l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:49,202
不管其他人保证要怎么做
no matter what the others promise to do,

52
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,777
他们根本做不到我所做的承诺
when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there.

53
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,980
坐下!你没有权利...
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

54
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,042
我们讨论一下这人说的话吧
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

55
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,346
- 你相信他吗？- 我们讨论一下吧
-Prescott, do you trust this man?
-Let's discuss what he has to say.

1911年

57
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,215
- 他的话毫无逻辑 - 他知道什么？我的家当都在那里！
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!
1911年

58
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:07,086
- 他的话毫无逻辑 - 他知道什么？我的家当都在那里！
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!

59
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,654
两三年，有可能要十年
Two or three years, it could be ten years!

60
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,924
-我们除了互相争执啥都没有 -看看那里的那口井
-We gain nothing by losing our heads!
-Look at that well out there!

61
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,522
没有人在吵架
Nobody's losing their heads.

62
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:20,096
你不该到这里的
You have no business being here!

63
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,507
叫那女人坐下
Sit that woman down, sir!

64
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,576
你可以坐下
You can sit down.

65
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,145
普兰优先生，请别走
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

66
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,250
不，先生，你要去哪里？
No, Mr. Plainview! No, where are you going?

67
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:35,443
-我不需要租这块地，谢谢 -可是我们需要你
-l don't need the lease. Thank you.
-But we need you.

68
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,784
这太混乱了，谢谢你拨空给我
Too much confusion. Thank you for your time.

69
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,584
不，没有什么混乱
No, no, there's no confusion.

70
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,387
你们心甘情愿，我才会要这块地
l wouldn't take the lease if you gave it to me as a gift.

71
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:56,802
班克先生，我不想浪费你的时间
Mr. Bankside, I'm not going to waste your time.

72
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,375
我也会感激你不浪费我的时间
I'd certainly appreciate it if you didn't waste mine.

73
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,210
如果你想跟我签约，我们十天内就能开始凿井
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

74
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:07,715
你的地在现存油井的北边
Your lot is further north from the discovery well up here.

75
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,445
那表示我们可能得凿深一点
That means we'll probably have to dig deeper.

76
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,954
如果那里的油跟我想的一样多
And if there's as much oil here as l think there is,

77
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:16,049
就会更难凿，不过一凿到就发了
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

78
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:20,721
动作要快，油很快就会被凿光了
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

79
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,196
我要你知道自己想怎么做
l need you to know what you want to do.

80
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,326
由于现存油井的距离
Now, because of the distance from the discovery well,

81
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,701
我付的使用费会少一点
l'll pay you a smaller royalty than you'd get down there

82
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,640
不过我会给你一千美元签约金
but l'm prepared to give you a $ 1,000 bonus on your lot.

83
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,301
你说的使用费是多少？
What kind of royalty are you talking about?

84
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:38,848
六分之一，加上十天内开凿的保证
One-sixth, plus a guarantee to start drilling within 10 days.

85
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,181
这种条件你在别处绝对找不到
Now, that's something you won't find anywhere else.

86
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,086
夫人，你小孩几岁了？
What age are your children, ma'am?

87
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,132
10岁和12岁
Ten and twelve.

88
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,902
普兰优先生，我有个问题，你太太人呢？
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir. Where is your wife?

89
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,837
她因难产过世了，夫人
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

90
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,275
我跟儿子一起相依为命
So it's just me and my son now.

91
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,086
就快喷油了，老板
lt's coming in, boss!

92
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:19,115
听见没？
Hear it?

93
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,744
普兰优先生？
Mr. Plainview?

94
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,511
什么事？
Yes?

95
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,414
你就是丹尼尔普兰优？
Are you Daniel Plainview?

96
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,792
对
Yes.

97
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,096
有何贵干？
What can l do for you?

98
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,729
你在找油
You look for oil.

99
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,459
没错
That's right.

100
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,596
你花多少钱租用有藏油的土地？
What do you pay for a place that has it?

101
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,731
-看情况 -看什么情况？
-Well, that depends. -What does it depend on?

102
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,575
有很多
On a lot of things.

103
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,541
如果我说我知道一个地方有油，那里的地价钱又便宜
lf l told you l knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

104
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,416
你想这消息值多少钱？
what do you think that would be worth?

105
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:29,654
我想...你该让我知道你知道什么
l think that you should let me know what you know

106
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,888
然后我们再谈交易的事
and then we'll try and work something out.

107
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,059
-我能坐吗？-请坐
-Can l sit down? -Please.

108
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:50,510
你隶属于哪个教堂？
What church do you belong to?

109
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,744
我...
l...

110
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,182
我不排斥宗教，我没有特别隶属于哪个教堂
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong
to one church in particular.

111
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:07,320
我全都爱，全都喜欢。你是从哪来的？
l like them all. l like everything. Where are you from?

112
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,299
那正是我要卖给你的消息
That would be telling you. That's what l want to sell you.

113
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,396
你在西诺丘做什么？
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

114
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,906
我们有油，地上就会渗油
We have oil, and it seeps through the ground.

115
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,602
你想付钱知道地点吗？
Do you want to pay me to know where it is?

116
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:23,646
地上有油并不代表地下也有
Just 'cause there's something on the ground
doesn't mean there's anything beneath it.

117
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,478
标准石油为什么买上面的地？
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

118
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,988
这地方在加州？
ls it in California?

119
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:34,983
-也许吧 -他们买多少地？
-Maybe. -How much land did they buy?

120
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,493
我比较希望你不要把我当笨蛋
l'd like it better if you didn't think l was stupid.

121
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,302
你为什么来找我？
Why did you come to me?

122
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:53,707
-你才刚挖到油 -没错
-You just brought this well in. -That's right.

123
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,144
所以，现在给我五百元现金
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash right now

124
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,682
我就让你知道地点
and l'll tell you where it is.

125
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,083
这样吧，我现在就给你一百元
l'll tell you what l'll do, son. l'll give you $ 1 00 now,

126
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:07,784
如果证明那里值得开凿，我就再给你一千元奖金
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $ 1,000 bonus.

127
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,858
六百元
Six hundred dollars.

128
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:15,597
你再告诉我，你们那里有什么
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

129
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,394
你们种什么？
What do you grow?

130
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,232
我们有个大牧场，但大多是石头
We have a big ranch, but it's mostly rocks.

131
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:23,807
试过种东西，却只长杂草
Plant things. Nothing will grow but weeds.

132
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,170
你以为上面会长什么？
What makes you think it's up?

133
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:28,301
那里有硫磺吗？还是碱矿？
ls there sulfur around? Or alkali deposits?

134
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,471
附近有碱矿，我不知道硫磺是啥
Alkali nearby. l don't know sulfur.

135
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,953
那是你儿子？
ls that your son?

136
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,791
对
Yes.

137
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,222
- 你好 - 你好
-Hi. -Hi.

138
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,265
-你是谁？-我是费契汉弥顿
-Who are you? -l'm Fletcher Hamilton.

139
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,368
幸会，孩子，你叫什么名字？
Nice to meet you, son. What's your name?

140
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,403
你是做什么的？
What do you do?

141
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,199
我帮普兰优先生做事
l work with Mr. Plainview.

142
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,672
这里有五百元
Here's $500, son.

143
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,577
你告诉我有价值的消息，这钱就是你的了
You tell me something worth hearing, this money's yours.

144
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:11,419
我来自伊沙贝郡的小波士顿镇
l come from a town called Little Boston in lsabella County.

145
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:18,061
就是这里。小波士顿有个铁路支线站
This is us, here. Spur station here at Little Boston.

146
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,132
你要找的就是桑德牧场
The Sunday ranch is what you're looking for.

147
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,461
有一条羊肠小径通到那里
There's a sheep trail that takes you there.

148
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:26,569
由镇上往西走一哩，不远
lt's a mile out of town headed west, not far.

149
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:30,571
只要走山脚下这条小路
Just through a small pass here near the base of the hills.

150
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:34,404
你会经过教堂，沿着小径走就行
You'll pass a church and just follow the sheep trail.

151
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:38,709
-标准石油买下哪里？ -这里和这里
-Where's Standard buying up? -Here and here.

152
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,285
-你姓桑德？ -对
-Your family name is Sunday, yes? -That's right.

153
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,911
你家有多少人？
How many's in your family?

154
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:48,185
父母、妹妹和我弟弟伊莱
My father and mother and sisters and my brother Eli.

155
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:51,020
-你有几个妹妹？ -两个
-How many sisters do you have? -Two.

156
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,426
-你叫什么名字？ -保罗
-What's your name? -Paul.

157
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,761
你家人知道石油的存在吗？
Does any of your family know about the oil that you say is there?

158
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,334
我不知道
l don't know.

159
00:23:58,435 --> 00:24:01,029
我叔叔一直说有石油
My uncle always said there was oil there,

160
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:03,673
但我不知道他们的想法
but l don't know what they heard or what they think.

161
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,173
你们种些什么？
What do you grow?

162
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:10,474
我们养羊，那是养羊的牧场。我说过，那里只长杂草
lt's goats. lt's a goat farm.
l told you, nothing grows but weeds.

163
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,049
-那里有水吗？ -是咸水
-ls there water? -lt's salty.

164
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,550
只要挖井，出来的几乎都是咸水
You drill a well, it's hard not to get saltwater.

165
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,824
我跟你们说，那里有石油
The oil is there. l'm telling you.

166
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,660
-我想走了 -你可以留下过夜
-l want to go now, so... -You can stay tonight.

167
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:33,861
-不，我想走了，我要走 -听着，保罗
-No, l want to go now. l want to leave.
-Listen, Paul.

168
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,507
如果我大老远跑去那里，却发现你骗我
lf l travel all the way out there
and l find that you've been lying to me,

169
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:43,271
我会找到你，拿回加倍的钱
l'm going to find you and l'm going
to take more than my money back.

170
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,611
那样可以吗？
ls that all right with you?

171
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,947
-可以，先生 -那么好吧
-Yes, sir. -All right, then.

172
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,782
-祝你们好运，上帝保佑 -你也是，年轻人
-Nice luck to you. God bless.
-And to you, young man.

173
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,213
有人来了
-There's someone coming. -Thank you, Mary.

174
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:47,494
-晚安 -晚安
-Good evening. -Good evening.

175
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:53,305
我叫丹尼尔普兰优，这是我儿子
My name's Daniel Plainview. This is my son, H.W.

176
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,942
-你来打猎的？ -猎鹌鹑
-Are you hunting? -Hunting for quail.

177
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,913
听说桑德牧场附近适合扎营
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

178
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,883
这里就是桑德牧场，你可以扎营
This is the Sunday ranch. You can camp here.

179
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:04,682
-谢谢，你有水吗？ -有的
-Thank you. Do you have water? -Yes.

180
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,713
听说几天前这里有地震
We heard there was an earthquake up here a few days ago.

181
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,759
-真的吗？ -是啊
-ls that right? -Yes.

182
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,190
-家里还好？ -很好，谢谢
-Your family? -Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

183
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:19,269
-你想喝的话，我们有羊奶 -那太好了
-We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
-That would be fine.

184
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:22,363
那现在
Now,

185
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:28,234
如果我们把帐棚架在那里，就不会挡到你们的路了
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

186
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:29,641
可以
That's fine.

187
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,942
露丝，过来帮忙，拿水给他们
Ruth! Help these men and bring them some water.

188
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,983
不行，H.W
No! H.W.

189
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,810
普兰优先生，你现在想喝羊奶吗？
Mr. Plainview, would you like that milk now?

190
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:43,017
-好的，谢谢 -玛丽，拿些羊奶来给他们
-That would be fine. Thank you.
-Mary! Bring them some milk.

191
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,616
我的家人会帮你架好你的帐棚
My family will help you set up your tent.

192
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,923
不，我们露营要自己动手
No, please. We set ourselves on this camping trip.

193
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,726
我们自己来架帐棚
We have to do the camping.

194
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,424
动作快
Hurry up!

195
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,163
-你有面包吗？ -我们有马铃薯
-Do you have bread? -We have potatoes.

196
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:58,969
马铃薯就很好了，谢谢
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

197
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,544
我会叫她们煮些马铃薯给你们
l'll have them boil you up some potatoes.

198
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,942
没关系，我们可以生火来煮
That's all right. l thought maybe we'd make a fire.

199
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,310
我想跟我儿子一起合作生火
l wanted to work with my son on making a fire.

200
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,349
我儿子伊莱会拿些柴来给你们
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you some wood.

201
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:09,510
谢谢你盛情的招待，桑德先生
Thank you so much for your hospitality, Mr. Sunday.

202
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,644
-没问题 -我们不会碍事
-Yes. -And we'll be out of your way.

203
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,486
只是来猎鹌鹑
-We're just hunting for quail. -Yes.

204
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,622
-抱歉我们没有面包 -没关系
-l'm sorry we don't have any bread.
-No, no, no.

205
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,527
这里种不出玉米，全是石头
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here. lt's mostly rock.

206
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,430
我们没地方可以种谷子
We don't have room to raise the grain.

207
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,230
谢谢你，小姐
Thank you, young lady.

208
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,126
我叫伊莱
My name is Eli.

209
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,596
是的，你是...伊莱桑德
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

210
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:03,066
欢迎你们
Welcome.

211
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,478
-H.W. -伊莱
-H.W. -Eli.

212
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,644
-你们来猎鹌鹑？ -是的
-You're hunting quail? -That's right.

213
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:25,420
-我们会拿晚餐过来 -谢谢，真感谢你
-We will bring dinner. -Thank you. Thank you so much.

214
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,035
爸!
Dad!

215
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,142
看我的鞋子
Dad, look at my shoe.

216
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,269
那是地震震出来的油，别激动
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

217
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,393
所以...
So...

218
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:48,296
所以？
So?

219
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:50,501
是啊，所以
So, so.

220
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:54,240
这里若有油，我们就运到海边
If there's anything here, we take it to the sea.

221
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:59,112
拉输油管到怀尼米港或圣宝拉
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

222
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:00,740
大约有一百哩
it's about 100 miles,

223
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:04,752
我们再跟联合石油谈交易，这一行就是这样
and we do a deal with Union Oil. This is what we do.

224
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:08,258
之后我们就不需要铁路还有运送成本了
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

225
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:09,951
懂吧？
You see?

226
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:13,653
懂
Yeah.

227
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,425
-你懂了？ -我懂
-You see that? -Yeah.

228
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,731
那样我们就能赚钱，赚大钱
Then we're making money. We're making the real money.

229
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:21,701
那也是我们该赚的
What we should be making. Not just...

230
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,137
不是把赚的钱浪费在运送上
Not just throwing it away on shipping costs.

231
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:26,434
那样赚的就太少了
Otherwise, it's just mud.

232
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,241
我们要付他们多少？
How much are we going to pay them?

233
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,846
他们是谁？
Who's that?

234
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,086
桑德家
The Sunday family.

235
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:43,558
我不会给他们油田价
l'm not going to give them oil prices.

236
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,394
我会给他们鹌鹑价
l'll give them quail prices.

237
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,766
我想跟你们谈一下
lf we could take a few minutes,

238
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,000
有件事我想跟你谈谈
there's something l'd very much like to talk with you about.

239
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,442
孩子的妈，带女孩子们出去
Mother, would you take the girls outside, please?

240
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,422
我说话不喜欢拐弯抹角
l believe in plain speaking, so...

241
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,258
这牧场很美，我喜欢猎鹌鹑
This is a beautiful ranch. l love hunting for quail.

242
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,192
我儿子有病，他需要新鲜空气
My boy has been sick, you know. He needs fresh air.

243
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:28,532
医生说他需要大量的新鲜空气
Doctors all say he needs plentiful fresh air.

244
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,432
那
So,

245
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:37,903
你想这块地的值多少钱？
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

246
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,576
-买下这里？ -是的
-To buy this place? -That's right.

247
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,386
想一下
Take a moment.

248
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:56,028
- 对不起，我不知道 - 一备六元
-l'm sorry. l don't know. -Six dollars an acre.

249
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,568
六元？谢谢，伊莱
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

250
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:03,365
还有加上多年来 用来改良牧场的五百元
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

251
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,031
我想出三千七买这个牧场
l'd like to offer you $3,700 for this ranch.

252
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,735
-就是三千七百元 -不行
-That's $3,700. -No.

253
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:12,010
上帝派这人来此，伊莱
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

254
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,639
是的，我相信是的
Yes, l believe He has.

255
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:17,811
-我出价三千七百元 -是什么引你来此的？
-My offer to you is $3,700.
-What is it that brought you here, sir?

256
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,684
万能上帝的指引
The Good Lord's guidance.

257
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,853
当然，之后我们可以租地给你
-Now, of course, within that... -What about our oil?
...we're going to develop a lease.

258
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:28,688
-你说呢？ -那我们的石油呢？
-What's that? -What about our oil?

259
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,500
什么石油？
What about it?

260
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:33,831
我们这里有石油，那很值钱
We have oil here. That's worth something.

261
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,338
你们有人会钻探石油？
Do you have someone who can drill for it?

262
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,431
-你认为这里有石油？ -我相信有
-Do you think there's oil here? -l know there is.

263
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,532
钻油费用是很昂贵的
lt's very expensive to drill.

264
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,871
把油从地底弄出来，你试过吗？
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

265
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,039
-那要多少钱？ -很贵
-How much is it? -Costly.

266
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:48,175
我们的油在地上就有
Well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.

267
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,016
我想那是渗出来的
l believe that's called seepage.

268
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,644
并不必然意味底下有东西
Doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath.

269
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,916
-你出多少钱买油？ -我不知道
-What would you give us for it? -l don't know.

270
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:57,925
-你也有不知道的 -是啊
-Something you don't know. -That's right.

271
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,233
你要多少？
What would you like, Eli?

272
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,233
一万
Ten thousand dollars.

273
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,101
为什么？
For what?

274
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,775
为了我的教堂
For my church.

275
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:26,045
有趣
That's good.

276
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,856
真是有趣
That's a good one.

277
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:33,588
那
Well...

278
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:38,360
要是我们决定钻探石油，若油井量产
lf we decide to drill for oil and if the well begins to produce,

279
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,096
我就给你的教堂五千元的签约金
l'll give your church a $5,000 signing bonus.

280
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,262
一万
Ten thousand.

281
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,840
你想找别人来这里钻油？
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

282
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,001
找别人投资兼做苦工？
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

283
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:51,012
我去别的牧场也能猎鹌鹑
l can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as l can here, so...

284

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,682
只有红利

286
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:03,322
很巧的是，我刚好在钻油业有认识人
Now, as it happens, l do have some
connections in the drilling business

287
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:07,989
他们也许能帮我们起头。你觉得如何，亚伯？
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

288
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:09,998

然后...地图在哪？

296
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:47,769
桑德牧场后的丘陵地在哪？
Where are the hills behind the Sunday ranch?

北文家的，那很好买，我保证
That's the Belvins', and that could be got, l'm sure.

304
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,163
这附近的地都能买下吗？
Can everything around here be got?

305
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,403
行
Sure.

306
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:49,186
保罗桑德成了我们的好朋友
Paul Sunday turned out to be a good friend of ours.

307
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,458
没错
That's right.

312
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,284

-Pretty good. Where's your dad? -He's inside.

313
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,820
你们从西诺丘大老远赶来了
You fellas are a long way from Signal Hill.

314
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,913
-你好，普兰优 -你好，金

318
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,664
你们是标准的家族事业
You boys are a regular family business.

319
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,498
你们来的有点晚了
You boys are a little late.

320
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:32,632
-你找到什么了？ -我找到一些有趣的东西
-What did you find?
-l found some interesting prospects.

321
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:34,003
听说标准石油买地了？
Did you hear Standard bought up?

322
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,739
-大多是北边的地 -我听说的也是
-Mostly in the north, so far.
-That's what l hear.

323
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,246
金，如果你想买地，往东去
l'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

324
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:45,650
我宁可是你买下那里。这附近的地都被买下了
l'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

325
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:49,315
有这个小帅哥在身边，谈买卖一定更顺利
lt must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

326
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:52,519

你真好，谢谢，祝你好运
That's very nice. Thank you. Good luck, Gene.

328
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:58,423
-保重 -我说过，往东边去
-Take care. -Like l said, go east.

329
00:38:58,534 --> 00:38:59,592
H.W.

330
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:03,298
你若要签约，可以找我当律师
l'll be your lawyer if you need to draw up a contract.

331
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,706
我能确保你不会被骗，帮你弄到你爸一半的利润
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

332
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,579
怎样？
How's that?

333
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,664
那些人在干嘛？
What are those men doing?

334
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,567
他们是帮我们工作的人
They're just guys that are working for us.

335
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,976
他们只是四处看看
They're just looking around.

336
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,447
我们能赚多少钱？
How much money can we make?

337
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,820
不知道，要看情况
l don't know. lt depends.

338
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:01,121
一千元？
One thousand dollars?

339
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:12,771
玛丽说若她不祷告，她爸就打她
Mary said that her father beats her if she doesn't pray.

340
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,817
玛丽，年纪比较小的那个？
Mary, she's the smaller one?

341
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,182
对，就是她
Yes, she is.

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,295
-都到齐了？ -非常成功
-Everyone here? -Very successful.

343
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,130
可是？
But?

344

有几块地找不到地主
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

345
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,405
-是谁的？ -威廉班迪
-Who? -William Bandy.

346
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,538
他是谁？
...eight. Who's he?

347
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,081
他在这里务农
He's an old man who homesteaded here.

348
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:56,242
跟孙子一起住，他想跟你谈谈
Lives with his grandson. He said he'd like to speak with you.

349
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,614
他来了？
ls he here?

350
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,713
不，他要你去找他
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

351
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,619
他要抬高价钱
He's boosting his price.

352
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,525
他说他想跟收买土地的人谈
He said he'd like to speak with whoever is doing the buying.

353
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:09,893
让他等着，他会找上门的，走吧
Well, let him wait. He'll come around. Let's go.

354
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,873
各位？
Ladies and gentlemen?

355
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,900
各位
Ladies and gentlemen.

356
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,445
谢谢你们今晚大驾光临
Thank you so much for visiting with us this evening.

357
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:29,143
我跨越了大半的北达克达州来到这里，来看看这块土地
Now, l've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

358
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,746
我敢说你们有人可能听说过
Now, I daresay some of you might have heard

359
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:37,690
一些更夸张的谣言，传说我有些什么计划
some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,

360
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:40,523
我只是认为你们该亲耳听我说
so I just thought you'd like to hear it from me.

361
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:43,530
就是这张脸，没什么神秘的
This is the face. It's no great mystery.

362
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:50,362
我是个石油商人，各位
I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,677
我对许多地方都有兴趣
I have numerous concerns spread across this state.

364
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:58,177
我有很多油井每天产出数千桶油
I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,

365
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,250
所以我认为我是个石油商
so I like to think of myself as an oilman.

366
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,016
身为石油商
As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive

367
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:07,021
我希望各位原谅我有话直说
just good old-fashioned plain speaking.

368
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,184
我们做的是家族事业
Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.

369
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:14,989
我跟我儿子H.W.携手合作
I work side by side with my wonderful son, H. W.

370
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,329
我想你们有人可能见过他了
I think one or two of you might have met him already.

371
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:22,233
我也鼓励我的手下带家人一起来
And I encourage my men to bring their families, as well.

372
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:26,331
当然，这么做有助于促进他们获得更有价值的人生
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

373
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:30,411
家庭代表孩子，孩子代表教育
Family means children, and children means education.

374
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,177
所以，不管我们落脚何处，教育是必要的
So, wherever we set up camp, education is a necessity,

375
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,512
我们也很高兴能满足需求
and we're just so happy to take care of that.

376
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:39,052
让我们在小波士顿造一间学校
So let's build a wonderful school in Little Boston.

377
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:41,418
这些孩子是我们努力的未来
These children are the future that we strive for,

378
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,619
所以他们也该拥有最好的
and so they should have the very best of things.

379
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,728
现在，还有一件事
Now, something else,

380
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,664
请别误会我有侮蔑的意思：面包
and please don't be insulted
if l speak about this. Bread.

381
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,802
我们来谈谈面包吧
Let's talk about bread.

382
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:56,802
在我看来，我很讨厌去想到
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination to consider

383
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:01,137
有任何男人、女人、或小孩，在我们这个伟大的国家里
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

384
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,768
竟然将一条面包视为是奢侈品
should have to look upon a loaf of bread as a luxury.

385
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:09,108
我们要在这里挖水井，而水井就代表灌溉
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

386
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,617
灌溉就意味着耕种
Irrigation means cultivation.

387
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:15,621
我们要在这里种谷子，在这之前一片荒芜的土地上
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

388
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,192
你们会有更多的谷子可以运用
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

389
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,264
面包会多到你吃不完，夫人
and bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am.

390
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:26,664
新的道路、农业、就业、教育
New roads, agriculture, employment, education.

391
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:28,793
这些只是改进的一小部份
These are just a few of the things we can offer you,

392
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,873
各位，我向你们保证
and l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

393
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,101
若我们真在此找到石油
that if we do find oil here,

394
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:36,677
我想我们很有可能会找到
and l think there's a very good chance that we will,

395
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:41,273
你们的社区将不再贫瘠，它将兴隆繁盛
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

396
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:46,579
我很乐意回答任何问题，请说？
l'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

397
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,213
新的道路会通往教堂吗？
Will the new road lead to the church?

398
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,762
那会是第一个通往的地方。谢谢你，伊莱，还有谁？
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

399
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,762
如果有任何事，我很容易找的
Well, if anything comes up, l'm pretty easy to find.

400
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,128
你们随时可以来找我
You just come visit with me.

401
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,226
谢谢各位宝贵的时间，晚安
Thank you so much for your time, and good night.

402
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:43,711

只要沿着通往教堂的新路

00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,835
新的路会引领你们过去

407
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:15,672

00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:49,306
“劳苦多愁软弱不堪”

415
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,373
“挂虑重担压肩头”
Cumbered with a load of care?

416

“主是你我避难处所”

“快到主恩座前求”
Take it to the Lord in prayer...

418
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:17,396

-All the men are provided for? -Of course.

424
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,621
充满干劲
Spirits seem high.

425
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:41,530
有什么需要我帮忙的吗？
ls there anything that you need from me?

426
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:48,865
-任何教堂能帮得上的忙？ -我想没有，谢谢
-Anything the church can do for you?
-l don't believe so. No. Thank you.

427
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,336
我知道你明天邀请大家
l understand you've asked the people to gather around

428
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:53,101
来此观看开井仪式
and watch the well begin tomorrow. ls that right?

429
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,177
- 是 - 我会为这口井祈福
-That's right. -l will bless the well.

430
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:59,608
在你开始之前，你该介绍我
Before you begin, you should introduce me.

431
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,309
你会看到我走向油井，然后...
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when l...

432
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:03,476
是油井塔
The derrick.

433
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:07,353
你会看到我走出来，然后你可以说出我的名字
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,650
你走出来？
When you walk up?

435
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:13,661
对，你会看到我走出来，然后你可以说...
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

436
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:18,891
“看顾上帝子民的本土之子”
''The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,''

437
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,501
然后你可以说出我的名字
and then you could say my name.

438
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,398
很好
That's fine.

439
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,775
-接着会怎样？ -接着我们就开始钻油
-And what happens then?
-Well, then we start the drill.

440
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:35,577
这是简单的祈福，不过却很重要
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel, but an important one.

441
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:38,721
只有几句话，不会太久
lt's just a few words. lt won't take long.

442
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:42,882
-什么时候？ -你们什么时候方便？
-What time? -What time's good for you, Eli?

443
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,858
-四点 -那就四点吧
-4:00. -Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

444
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:50,695
-很感谢你来访 -祝你愉快，谢谢
-My thanks for your visit. -Good day. Thank you.

445
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:08,050
各位午安
Afternoon, everyone.

446
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:11,012
跟我来
Come with me.

447
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,851
感谢各位在这个时刻来访
l thank you all so much for visiting with us at this time.

448
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,827
我很荣幸见过你们其中几位
l've had the pleasure of meeting some of you

449
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:23,762
希望接下来的日子里
and l hope very much in the months to come,

450
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,030
我能拜访你们每一个人
l'll be able to visit with each and every one of you.

451
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:29,831
我擅长钻凿却不善演说
l'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

452
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:31,563
所以今晚略过演说
so let's forget the speech for this evening,

453
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,539
直接祈祷吧
just make it a simple blessing.

454
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,472
要明白，钻油不能只靠一个人
You see, one man doesn't prospect from the ground.

455
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:39,480
这要靠一整个社区的善良百姓，像各位
lt takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

456
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:42,608
而这很不错，我们齐聚一堂
and this is good. We stay together.

457
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,481
我们一起祷告、工作
We pray together, we work together,

458
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:47,521
若上帝对我们的努力微笑以待
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly on our endeavor,

459
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,159
我们就共享财富
we share in the wealth together.

460
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,621
在玛丽一号井开工前
Now, before we spud in Mary's Well Number One,

461
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,927
这井以我身旁的玛丽桑德命名
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

462
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:01,003
在地的本土之女
a proud daughter of these hills,

463
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,833
我想说，上帝保佑真诚的工人，当然，还有
l'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

464
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,998
上帝保佑各位
God bless you all.

465
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,268
阿门
Amen.

466
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,902
去吧

467
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,414

Fast as you can, H.W.

469
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,088
准备好了？
Are you ready to do this?

470
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,407
动工了，各位
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

471
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:47,409
艾尔罗斯很慷慨的为这个典礼自掏腰包的
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

472
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:50,213
提供了一些点心，谢谢你
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

473
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:55,391
请各位自便，我马上回来
lf you'll all just care to help yourselves,
l'll be back in a minute.

474
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:09,922
玛丽

475
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,195
玛丽桑德

476
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,768
-你喜欢你的新衣服吗？ -喜欢，谢谢
-Do you like your new dress?
-Yes. Thank you.

477
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,775
不用客气，我就觉得你会喜欢

478
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:25,170
-你高兴我来这里吗？ -高兴
-Are you happy l came here? -Yes.

479
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:30,614
你爸没再打你了吧？他有吗？
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

480
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,478
最好是没有，对吧？
Better not, right?

481
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:36,014
我会照顾你的
l'll take care of you.

482
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:42,224
不再被打了，对吧？不再被打了，去吧
No more hitting, right? No more hitting. Now go.

483
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:45,425
去多玩一下，不用再回来了
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

484
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:56,204
丹尼尔？
Daniel?

485
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:03,813
没事，H.W.，回去睡吧。去吧，快回去睡
lt's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

486
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,516
丹尼尔
Daniel.

487
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,119
丹尼尔
Daniel.

488
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,324
丹尼尔
Daniel!

489
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,092
丹尼尔
Daniel!

490
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,793
怎样？
What?

491
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:23,429
井里死了一个人
Lost a man down the well.

492
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:30,103
-哪一个？ -乔根达
-What man? -Joe Gundha.

493
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:34,309
-我认识他吗？ -不认识
-Did l know him? -No.

494
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:35,742
怎么回事？
What happened?

495
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,018
拉起来
Pick it up.

496
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:47,086
拉刹车
Set the brake.

497
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,527
-绑起来 -绑好
-Tie it down. -Tie it on.

498
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:55,626
糟了
Shit!

499
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,340
该死，遗体呢？
God damn it. Where's the body?

500
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:03,668
-他们正在找 -好
-They're fishing it out now. -All right.

501
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,677
-钻头呢？ -在台子上
-Where's the bit? -lt's on the deck.

502
00:53:53,195 --> 00:53:56,028
清理一下，帮他换衣服
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

503
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,461
然后
And...

504
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:01,695
架设一顶帐棚
Set up a tent.

505
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:05,706
任何人下去井里都要通知其他人，明白吗？
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

506
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,036
- 是 - 是，老板
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

507
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,739
中午以前停工
Shut down till midday.

508
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:50,452
我看到了，是的，昨晚，我看到了
And l had a vision. Yes, last night, l had a vision

509
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:53,452
我感觉到上帝的气息贯穿我
and l felt God's breath move through me.

510
00:54:57,092 --> 00:55:01,188
沉入我的胃
And it rolled down into my stomach.

511
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,065
它劈啪作响
lt sloshed around.

512
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,302
我的胃低语着，不是呐喊
And my stomach spoke in a whisper, not a shout,

513
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:17,773
“用手抚摸这位女士并抚慰她”
''Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her.'' Yes.

514
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:24,278
亲爱的杭特太太
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

515
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:27,820
你有关节炎，对吧？
you have arthritis, don't you?

516
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,925
-是的，伊莱 -好
-Yes, l do, Eli. -Yes.

517
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,653
恶魔在你手上，我会把它拉出来
The devil is in your hands, and l will suck it out.

518
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:39,166
我不会激动的把这恶魔扔出去
Now, l will not cast this ghost out with a fever

519
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:44,329
因为在我体内的神灵告诉我，我有新的沟通方法
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me l have a new way to communicate.

520
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,833
就是轻柔的低语
lt is a gentle whisper.

521
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:57,583
离开吧，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,588
离开这里，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,150
离开
Get out.

524
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,563
离开这里，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.

525
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:15,130
离开这里，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.

526
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:19,173
-快进入这位女士的身体 -离开这里，恶鬼
-...and enter this woman's body now.
-Get out of here, ghost.

527
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:24,110
离开这里，不准你再转身回来
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

528
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:26,974
你若胆敢回来
For if you do,

529
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:32,612
我会用全身神力给你迎头痛击
all the armies of my boot will kick you in the teeth

530
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,213
而你会被扔出去，丢进泥土里
and you will be cast up and thrown in the dirt

531
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:38,759
一屁股跌回地狱
and thrust back to perdition!

532
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,592
只要我牙齿还在，我要咬穿你
And as long as l have teeth, l will bite you,

533
00:56:42,697 --> 00:56:46,657
就算我没牙齿，也会咬紧双颚
and if l have no teeth, l will gum you!

534
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:50,500
只要我拳头还在，我会痛揍你
And as long as l have fists, l will bash you!

535
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,338
滚吧，恶鬼!快离开这里!
Now, get out of here, ghost! Get out of here, ghost!

536
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,503
滚出去，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost!

537
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,275
它走了
And it left!

538
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,077
哈利路亚!
-Hallelujah! -Hallelujah!

539
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:10,056
-赞美主和他的节日 -赞美上帝
-Praise the Lord and His holy days! -Praise God!

540
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,617
-阿门!谢谢 -感谢您，耶稣，感谢你，上帝
-Amen! Thank you.
-Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

541
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,059
亲爱的杭特太太
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

542
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:22,570
跟我一起跳舞吧
Dance with me.

543
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:31,943
-感谢莅临 -真精彩的讲道
-Thanks for coming. -lt was a wonderful sermon.

544
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,447
-明天你会来吗？ -会的
-Will l see you tomorrow? -Yes.

545
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:40,547
伊莱
Eli.

546
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,789
昨晚井里发生悲剧
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

547
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,724
我听说了
Yes, l heard.

548
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,231
乔根达是虔诚的信徒
Joe Gundha was a man of considerable faith.

549
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:55,565
如果你想为他祈祷，他的葬礼是明天中午
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

550
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:58,538
丹尼尔，这场意外原本可以避免
Daniel, this accident could have been avoided.

551
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,733
那口井真令人遗憾
lt is terrible to think of that well

552
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:02,503
- 他们连续工作... - 这些人轮12小时的班
-working away out there...
-These men work in 12-hour shifts.

553
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,010
-没有获得祈福 -他们需要休息
-...unblessed. -They need their rest.

554
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:05,512
没休息，就会犯错
lf they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

555
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:06,672
我看过他们喝酒
l've seen the men drinking.

556
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:08,612
那有关系吗？
Don't you think that has something to do with this?

557
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:10,150
这些人需要好好休息
We need these men well-rested to bring in this well.

558
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,447
如果他们听你讲道就不能休息
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

559
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,681
油井就没办法产油...更没办法让大家发财
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

560
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:16,815
我真希望跟乔多相处些时日
l wish l had more time with Joe Gundha.

561
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:18,153
该多做些什么的
More could have been done.

562
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:23,221
那么那口井就不能产油，也不能让大家发财
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

563
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,869
请你帮忙把他的私人物品
Now, would you see to it that his personal possessions

564
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,135
送还给他的家人，好吗？
find their way back to his family, please?

565
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:35,766
谢谢
Thank you.

566
00:58:36,244 --> 00:58:39,373
听说你计划改建？
Heard you were planning some renovations.

567

我们脚下有无尽的藏油
There's a whole ocean of oil under our feet!

除了你，没人能帮我挖出来

624
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:53,238
你要怎么找？

我们什么时候可以拿到钱？

630
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,765
你不是治疗者吗？你不是神灵选中的人？
Aren't you a healer? And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

631
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,911
你何时要来让我儿子恢复听力？
When are you coming over and make my son hear again?

632
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,204
你做不到？
Can't you do that?

633
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:39,280
若让我为井祈福，这就不会发生
lf you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

634
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,180
-丹尼尔 -你不该这么做的
-Daniel. -You shouldn't have done that.

635
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:47,853
你欠第三启示教堂5千元
You owe the Church of the Third Revelation $5,000

636
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:50,823
这是我们谈妥的交易条件之一
as part of the arrangement that we made!

637
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:05,404
别想跟我斗，小矮子! 敢到这里来闹事
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

638
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,215
就是这样
That's it, that's it.

639
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,923
我要把你埋到地下
l'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

640
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,563
我要把你埋到地下
l'm going to bury you underground.

641
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:09,899
你是个笨蛋，亚伯
You are a stupid man, Abel.

642
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:16,371
你引狼入室来占我们便宜
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

643
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:23,041
你让他来，在这里开挖石油
You let him in and do his work here,

644
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:27,118
你这个笨蛋却廉价贱卖土地
and you are a stupid man for what we could have had.

645
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:31,225
我遵照上帝旨意，我试过
l followed His word, Eli. l tried.

646
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,056
你啥都没做，只是呆坐家中
You didn't do anything but sit down.

647
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,899
你既懒又蠢
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

648
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:45,734
你想上帝会为你的愚蠢拯救你？
Do you think God is going to save you for being stupid?

649
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,935
他不救愚蠢的人
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

650
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:58,753
我要为你做的事扯烂你，笨蛋
l will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

651
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,219
他怎么会来？你真的知道吗？
How did he come here? Do you really know? l know!

652
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,917
-儿子，求你别这样 -安静!
-Son, don't do this, please! -Be quiet!

653
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:09,087
闭上你的嘴，亚伯! 都怪你那个笨儿子
Shut your mouth, Abel! lt was your stupid son!

654
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:13,201
是保罗叫他来的，我知道
lt was Paul who told him to come here. l know it.

655
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:15,030
他跑去找他，还说...
He went to him and he said,

656
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:19,869
“我愚蠢的父亲会卖出他的地”
''My stupid, weak father will give away his lots.

657
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,434
“去占他的便宜” 而你竟让这一切发生了
''Go and take him.'' And you let it happen.

658
01:16:27,984 --> 01:16:31,078
真是一对呆瓜父子
A stupid father to a stupid son.

659
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,420
滚出去
Get out of there!

711
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,314
-不多 -直接回答我
-Not much. -Just answer me directly.

712
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:17,015
没有，就说你想留下来工作
You say ''nothing,'' then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

713
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:22,095
更好的是，我希望听到你说你想留下来
And it's better, l'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

714
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,097
我想留下来
l'd like to be here.

715
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:36,069
我是个好工人。我做过钻油架、建过铁路

716
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,238
我不需要帮忙

717
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:46,810
很好

718
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,408
我母亲知道些什么？
What did my mother know?

719
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:18,680
我不知道
I don't know.

720
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,783
我不知她知不知道，换个角度想，也许她根本不知道
I don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.

721
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,393
你为何离开？
Why did you leave?

722
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:33,234
我知道你跟我们的爸爸处不好
I know you didn't get on with our father.

723
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:42,139
我为地理调查组织工作去了堪萨斯
l worked for Geological Survey and went to Kansas.

724
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:47,605
我在那待不下去，我就是没办法
l couldn't stay there. l just couldn't.

725
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,876
我不喜欢自我辩解
l don't like to explain myself.

726
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:02,158
-亨利，你很容易生气吗？ -气什么？
-Are you an angry man, Henry? -About what?

727
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:06,764
你嫉妒心重吗？你会嫉妒吗？
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

728
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,003
我不这么想，不会
l don't think so, no.

729
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:16,807
我天生爱出头
l have a competition in me.

730
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,447
我不要别人成功
l want no one else to succeed.

731
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:29,980
-我痛恨大部分的人 -那部份的我已经死了
-l hate most people. -That part of me is gone.

732
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:34,094
工作和不成功
Working and not succeeding,

733
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:38,189
所有的...失败都让我...
all my failures have left me...

734
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:43,100
我不在乎了
l just don't care.

735
01:25:44,805 --> 01:25:47,399
如果我有，你就有
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

736
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:54,314
我有时候看着人们，却看不到值得喜欢的特点
There are times when l look at people
and l see nothing worth liking.

737
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:04,382
我想赚到足够的钱，远离所有人
l want to earn enough money l can get away from everyone.

738
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,899
你要拿你的孩子怎么办？
What will you do about your boy?

739
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,268
我不知道
l don't know.

740

也许情况会改变
Maybe it'll change.

741
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:29,783
人的听力会恢复吗？我不知道，也许也没人知道
Does your sound come back to you?

742
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:34,115
-医生也许也不知道 -他母亲呢？

743
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:43,087
我不想谈我的私事
l don't want to talk about those things.

744
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,698
我很清楚人性的黑暗面
l see the worst in people, Henry.

745
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:54,573
我不需要认识他们就能知道
l don't need to look past seeing them to get all l need.

746
01:26:56,744 --> 01:27:00,703
多年来我逐渐的建立了我的仇恨感
l've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.

747
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:07,752
你的到来给了我第二股能量
Having you here gives me a second breath of life.

748
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,585
我不能继续靠自己打拼
l can't keep doing this on my own

749
01:27:14,895 --> 01:27:19,923
跟这些烂人
with these people.

750
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,265
丹尼尔!丹尼尔，醒醒!丹尼尔!
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

751
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:48,104
我要去跟车掌说句话
Just have to go and have a word with the conductor.

752
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,976
我马上回来
l'll be right back.

753
01:29:51,086 --> 01:29:55,819
你待在这里，明白吗？待在这里
You stay here. You understand? You stay here.

我马上回来

-提佛 -普兰优

这是我弟弟，亨利普兰优

我是提佛，幸会

01:31:16,371 --> 01:31:17,770
那么...
So...

-Shall we? -Yes.

763
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:29,912
你儿子好吗？
How's your boy?

01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:33,418
-多谢你关心 -我们帮得上什么忙吗？
-Thank you for asking. -ls there anything we can do?

765
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,921
关心就够了
Thanks for asking is enough.

766
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:39,594
你有什么计划？
So what are your plans?

767
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:44,594
你们是想买我这里的土地？
ls this about buying up my tracts here?

768
01:31:44,733 --> 01:31:45,791
对
Yes.

769
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,698
电报提的是我在灰狼坡的地
The cable was about my Coyote Hills lease.

770
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:53,068
-我们也想买那里 -灰狼坡的地你出价多少？
-We'd like that, too.
-What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

771
01:31:53,173 --> 01:31:57,735
-我们出15万买所有的权利 -我接受，接下来呢？
-We'll offer 1 50,000 for full title.
-That's a deal. What's next?

772
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:02,981
你在小波士顿有一万一千备地。你有一口能产油的井
You have 11 ,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

773
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,948
-先前出了事 -我有三口能产油的井
-that was damaged... -l have three wells proven.

774
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:08,954
你根本没查清楚，是三口井
You haven't been paying attention. That's three proven wells.

775
01:32:13,228 --> 01:32:17,561
我们一分钟内就能让你成为富翁
We'll make you a millionaire while you're sitting here
from one minute to the next.

776
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:22,163
那我接下来要做什么？
And what else would l do with myself?

777
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:28,273
-你问我？ -我还能做什么？
-Are you asking me? -What else would l do with myself?

778
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,003
照顾你儿子
Take care of your son.

779
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,149
我不知道你要做什么
l don't know what you would do.

780
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:40,186
若你是我，标准石油花一百万
lf you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

781
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:43,051
买你所拥有的一切，为什么？
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

782
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:45,385
你知道原因
You know why.

783
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:47,358
你该自己去挖掘
Yeah, you fellas should just scratch around in the dirt

784
01:32:47,462 --> 01:32:50,828
像我们一样找油，而不是买下别人的心血
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

785
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:52,932
我挖过，孩子
l've scratched around the dirt, son.

786
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:55,059
你要改变你的运输成本？
You going to change your shipping costs?

787
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:58,139
运送成本不由我们决定，是铁路
We don't dictate shipping costs. That's railroad business.

788
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,801
你们没买下铁路啊？
You don't own the railroads?

789
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:08,373
你们当然买下了
'Course you do. Of course you do.

790
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,484
你要把油运到哪里？
Where you going to put it all?

791
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:15,180
哪里？
Where?

792
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:20,885
建输油管？找联合石油？随便你
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

793
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:22,690
不过你若无法成功
But if you can't pull it off,

794
01:33:22,796 --> 01:33:26,823
你脚下有再多油也卖不出去
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

795
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:32,533
何不卖给我们？我们能让你发财
Why not turn it over to us? We'll make you rich.

796
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,938
你就好好陪你儿子吧
You spend time with your boy.

797
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:38,137
这是个伟大的发现
lt's a great discovery.

798
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:41,207
让我们帮你吧
Now, let us help you.

799
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,485
你这是教我怎么经营我的家庭？
Did you just tell me how to run my family?

800
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:55,789
这可能比找到石油还重要
lt might be more important now
that you've proven the field

801
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,795
而我们想帮你
and we're offering to buy you out.

802
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:00,162
有一天我会去找你，摸进你家
One night l'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

803
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:03,237
或你睡觉的地方，割了你的喉咙
or wherever you're sleeping,
and l'm going to cut your throat.

804
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:04,930
什么？
What?

805
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:06,364
你说什么？你疯了吗？
What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy?

806
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,135
-你听见我说的话了？ -我听见了
-Did you hear what l said? -l heard what you said,

807
01:34:08,243 --> 01:34:10,541
- 你干嘛这么说？-不准你教我怎么养儿子
-why did you say it?
-You don't tell me about my son.

808
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,840
你干嘛抓狂又威胁要杀我？
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

809
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:16,006
-不准你教我怎么养儿子 -我没教你任何事
-You don't tell me about my son.
-l'm not telling you anything!

810
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:19,917
我要你讲理，若有冒犯，我道歉
l'm asking you to be reasonable.
lf l've offended you, l apologize.

811
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:22,216
等着看我有何能耐吧
You'll see what l can do.

812
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:34,195
这一小块地是哈普拥有的三千备牧场
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

813
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,826
这是圣路易斯郡的土地
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

814
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:38,801
从这里到海边，都是联合石油的
And from here to the coast, it's all Union Oil.

815
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:42,034
这是什么？这怎么不是我的？
What's this? Why don't l own this?

816
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:49,574
-这怎么不是我的？ -那是班迪的地
-Why don't l own this?
-That's the Bandy tract.

817
01:34:50,385 --> 01:34:53,547
我们在买地时，他拒绝出售
He was the holdout, when we were doing the buying.

818
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:56,087
他原本想跟你谈
He had hoped to speak with you.

819
01:35:00,295 --> 01:35:03,752
不能在这块地附近建输油管吗？
Can't you just build the pipeline around this tract?

820
01:35:06,768 --> 01:35:10,795
我能在第赫求庇山脉周围建五十哩的输油管吗？
Can l build around 50 miles of Tehachapi mountains?

821
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:13,463
别在我面前耍白痴
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

822
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:17,805
-我可以再去找他 -不，我去跟那个人谈
-l can go to him again. -No, l'll go and talk to the man.

823
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:20,846
我去谈，让你看看怎么做才对

好，打包行李吧，亨利

你要带亨利去见联合石油的人？

830
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:19,498
-你是威廉班迪的儿子？ -孙子

01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:21,404

我说他出去了，你要干嘛？
Told you, he's out. Now, what do you want?

834
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:32,985
我叫丹尼尔普兰优，我想跟他谈谈他的地

我们不要你来这里乱挖

我也不要，他什么时候回来？

告诉他我想跟他谈，不谈挖地

方达勒克有间房子

约翰霍利建的，你记得吗？

the most beautiful house l'd ever seen,

850
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:03,155
我想要它
and l wanted it.

851
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:06,399
我想住在里面
l wanted to live in it.

852
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:08,229
在里面吃饭
And eat in it.

853
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:10,462
清扫它
And clean it.

854
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:17,774
就算还只是个孩子，我也想让自己的孩子在附近奔跑
And even as a boy, l wanted
to have children to run around in it.

855
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:22,210
你现在想要什么都能拥有了
You can have anything you'd like now, Daniel.

856
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,645
你也该拥有
And you should.

857
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,983
-你想在哪里建房子？ -这里，也许吧，靠近海边
-Where are you going to build it?
-Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

858
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:35,690
你想建一栋一模一样的房子？
Would you make it look like that house?

859
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:43,893
我现在要是看到那栋房子会吐
l think if l saw that house now, it'd make me sick.

860
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:52,811
我们可以用餐，再找几个女人
We can eat and get some women.

861
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,877
带她们去桃树舞厅跳舞
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

862
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:05,625
我说灌醉她们再带她们去跳舞
l say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

863
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:09,962
好

864
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:31,076
你能给我一点钱吗？
Can l have some money, please?

865
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,920
你能给我一点钱吗？
Can l have some money, please?

866
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:32,462
我要你告诉我一件事
l want you to tell me something.

867
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:37,804
什么事？
What?

868
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:41,804
那房子旁边的牧场叫什么名字？
What's the name of the farm next to the Hill House?

869
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:57,657
那房子旁边的牧场叫什么名字？
What was the name of the farm next to the Hill House?

870
01:44:01,202 --> 01:44:04,194
-我不记得了 -你是谁？
-l can't remember... -Who are you?

871
01:44:07,173 --> 01:44:09,108
我会走的，丹尼尔
l'll leave, Daniel.

872
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:12,471
你是谁？
Who are you?

873
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,479
我谁都不是
l'm no one.

874
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:20,582
让我起来离开吧
Just let me get up and go.

875
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,755
我有弟弟吗？
Do l have a brother?

876
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:33,927
我在国王城认识一个人，他说他是你弟弟
l met a man in King City who said he was your brother.

877
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:39,564
我们当了几个月的朋友
We were friends for months.

878
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,975
在国王城工作
Working in King City.

879
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:48,113
他想设法来找你
And he wanted to make his way to you, Daniel.

880
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,476
我们身无分文
We didn't have any money.

881
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:58,654
他死于肺结核
He died of tuberculosis.

882
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:01,925
他没有遇害
He wasn't harmed.

883
01:45:02,962 --> 01:45:05,158
不是他杀，没阴谋
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

884
01:45:07,033 --> 01:45:09,264
不过他跟我说过你的事
But he told me about you,

885
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:14,604
我只是用了他的故事
and l just took his story,

886
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:20,246
利用了他的日记
used his diary.

887
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:24,775
丹尼尔
Daniel.

888
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:29,685
丹尼尔，我是你朋友
Daniel, l'm your friend.

889
01:45:31,891 --> 01:45:34,326
我并没有想伤害你
l'm not trying to hurt you.

890
01:45:34,427 --> 01:45:36,088
从来没有
Never.

891
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:38,625
只想苟活
Just survive.

892
01:45:39,033 --> 01:45:40,556
不!
No!

893
01:47:30,845 --> 01:47:33,609
“我的哥哥...”

894
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,551
你是谁？
Who is it?

895
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,320
我是班迪
l'm Bandy.

896
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,771
是的、是的
Yes. Yes.

897
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:12,972
威廉班迪
William Bandy.

898
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:18,810
对，我想租用你的土地
Yeah, l'd like to lease your land.

899
01:49:21,287 --> 01:49:24,814
我之前有请你来找我谈
l had asked for you to come and talk to me before.

900
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:27,189
当时你正在租地
When you were leasing land.

901
01:49:28,462 --> 01:49:30,259
没错，是的
That's right, yes.

902
01:49:31,966 --> 01:49:34,457
我儿子生了重病
My boy's been very sick, you know.

903
01:49:35,636 --> 01:49:38,127
这是在你儿子生病之前
This was before your boy got sick.

904
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:48,646
我知道
你想在我的土地上建输油管
Now, l know that you would like to build a pipeline
through my property.

905
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:52,845
-我听说的没错吧？ -完全正确
-ls that right, what l've heard?
-lt's absolutely right. And,

01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:59,020
八寸的油管，有你同意就可以埋设

908
01:49:59,126 --> 01:50:01,685
我向你保证绝对不会破裂
l guarantee you absolutely no disruption...

909
01:50:01,795 --> 01:50:03,319
上帝
God.

910
01:50:04,864 --> 01:50:07,425
上帝跟我说过你该怎么做
God has told me what you must do.

911
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,670
该怎么做呢？
And what is that?

912
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:18,409
你该接受耶稣基督的洗礼
You should be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ.

913
01:50:20,247 --> 01:50:22,146
但我受洗过了
But l am.

914
01:50:23,684 --> 01:50:26,345
我受洗过了，班迪先生
l have been washed, Mr. Bandy. l have been.

915
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:32,185
那是你救赎的唯一方法,也是你达成目标的唯一方法
lt's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

916
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:37,654
你可以在第三启示教堂受洗
You can take it at the Church of the Third Revelation.

917
01:50:40,067 --> 01:50:42,034
我付你三千元
l'll pay you $3,000.

918
01:50:44,704 --> 01:50:47,469
我希望你成为我们教堂的一员

919

我付你五千元

920
01:50:52,378 --> 01:50:53,970
受洗吧

921
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:59,048
免除你所犯下的罪行
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

922
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:08,192
你是说什么罪行，班迪先生？
What sin are you referring to, Mr. Bandy?

923
01:51:09,363 --> 01:51:11,194
钻油的罪行？
My sin of drilling?

924
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:05,975
我真诚希望每个人都能获得救赎，你们不是吗？
I truly wish everyone could be saved, don't you?

925
01:52:06,086 --> 01:52:07,985
是的
Yes.

926
01:52:08,087 --> 01:52:10,818
可是恐怕并非如此
I am afraid that's just not the case.

927
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:16,219
普世救赎的教义是谎言，不是吗？
The doctrine of universal salvation is a lie, is it not?

928
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:18,957
-那是谎言 -那是谎言
-lt's a lie. -lt's a lie.

929
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:23,832
我希望每个人都能获得救赎，但并非如此，并非如此
l wish everyone could be saved, but they won't. No, they won't.

930
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:27,429
你永远不会获得救赎，如果你...
You will never be saved if you...

931
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:29,509
拒绝接受主
Reject the blood.

932
01:52:30,344 --> 01:52:31,868
很好
Good.

933
01:52:32,546 --> 01:52:37,006
现在，有罪人想获得救赎吗？
Now, is there a sinner here looking for salvation?

934
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,448
新的成员？
A new member?

935
01:52:45,792 --> 01:52:47,520
我再问一次
l'll ask it again.

936
01:52:49,563 --> 01:52:52,225
有罪人来此寻求上帝吗？
ls there a sinner here looking for God?

937
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:53,890
是的
Yes.

938
01:52:57,671 --> 01:52:59,262
让我来
Allow me.

939
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:04,070

01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:14,113
我们这里有个罪人，他希望获得救赎
We have a sinner with us here who wishes for salvation!

942
01:53:14,253 --> 01:53:17,814
-丹尼尔，你是罪人吗？ -是的
-Daniel, are you a sinner? -Yes.

943
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:20,619
主上听不见你，丹尼尔
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

944
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:24,560
告诉他，去跟他说，没关系的
Say it to Him. Go ahead and speak to him. lt's all right.

945
01:53:25,364 --> 01:53:27,662
-是的 -双膝跪地
-Yes. -Down on your knees.

946
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,462
向他祷告
Pray to Him.

947
01:53:30,703 --> 01:53:35,106
仰望天空说出来
Look up to the sky and say it.

948
01:53:37,711 --> 01:53:39,837
你要我说什么？
What do you want me to say?

949
01:53:40,881 --> 01:53:45,375
你来到这里，带来良善和财富
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

950
01:53:45,519 --> 01:53:49,682
可是也带来你的坏习惯
but you have also brought your bad habits as a backslider.

951
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:54,088
你勾引女性又遗弃孩子
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

952
01:53:54,194 --> 01:53:57,253
你的孩子，你抚养又遗弃
Your child, that you raised, you have abandoned

953
01:53:57,363 --> 01:53:59,797
只因他病了，因此你有罪
all because he was sick and you have sinned.

954
01:53:59,932 --> 01:54:02,094
大声说吧，我是罪人
So say it now. l am a sinner.

955
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:04,101
-我是罪人 -大声一点

956
01:54:04,203 --> 01:54:06,934
-我是罪人 -我是罪人

大声点，丹尼尔!我是罪人!

-我是罪人 -主啊，对不起

959
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:14,373
-主啊，对不起 -我要受洗

960
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,814
-我要受洗 -你遗弃了你的孩子
-l want the blood. -You have abandoned your child.

961
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:19,916
我遗弃了我的孩子
l have abandoned my child.

962
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,386
-我将永远不再犯 -我将永远不再犯
-l will never backslide. -l will never backslide.

963
01:54:22,488 --> 01:54:25,457
我曾迷失，但我现已觉醒

说出来，说啊
Say it. Say it.

966
01:54:34,568 --> 01:54:37,594
-我遗弃了我的孩子 -大声说，说大声点
-l abandoned my child. -Say it louder. Say it louder!

967
01:54:37,703 --> 01:54:39,796
我遗弃了我的孩子
l've abandoned my child!

968
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:43,234
我遗弃了我的孩子
l've abandoned my child!

969
01:54:43,342 --> 01:54:45,333
我遗弃了我的孩子
l've abandoned my boy!

970
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:47,912
现在乞求受洗
Now beg for the blood!

971
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:50,947
让我受洗，让我离开这里
Just give me the blood, Eli. Let me get out of here.

972
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,814
让我受洗，主啊，让我离开
Give me the blood, Lord, and let me get away!

973
01:54:53,953 --> 01:54:57,685
你接受耶稣基督成为你的主和救世主吗？
Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?

974
01:54:57,823 --> 01:55:00,587
-我接受 -滚出去吧，恶魔
-Yes, l do. -Get out of here, devil!

975
01:55:00,694 --> 01:55:03,492
出去，恶魔!出去，罪衍!
Out, devil! Out, sin!

976
01:55:03,663 --> 01:55:06,224
-让我感受主的力量 -你接受
-Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
-Do you accept

977
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:10,234
第三启示教堂导引你吗？
the Church of the Third Revelation as your spiritual guide?

978
01:55:11,771 --> 01:55:15,935
-滚出去，恶鬼 -你的主在哪里，伊莱？
-Get out of here, ghost! -Where is your Lord, Eli?

979
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:20,170

“你是否愿从罪担得释放？”
Would you be free from the burden of sin?

983
01:55:32,626 --> 01:55:34,957
“宝血有能力”

你何不一边挥你的手

一边要这家伙告诉我你去了哪里

你这是一大失策。为什么要这么做？

我知道你我许多事都意见相左

我宁可你当父亲而不是事业伙伴

我要离开你
l'm going away from you.

1120
02:12:35,314 --> 02:12:37,975
这并不难，对吧？
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1121
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:42,579
以你的所作所为扼杀我们
Killing us with what you're doing.

1122
02:12:45,457 --> 02:12:48,916
你扼杀了我把你当儿子的形象

你太顽固，不肯聆听

别这么说，我知道你不是有意的
Please don't say that. l know you don't mean it.

02:12:58,304 --> 02:13:02,239
这是事实，你不是我儿子，你一直都不是
lt's the truth. You're not my son. You never have been.

1127

你听过这个字眼吗？
Did you ever hear that word?

02:13:11,917 --> 02:13:13,850
把我说的话告诉他
Tell him what l said.

1130
02:13:14,587 --> 02:13:17,488
你现在的行为就像孤儿
You operated here today like one.

1131
02:13:19,125 --> 02:13:21,592
我早该料想到这一天的
l should have seen this coming.

我早该知道的，过去这些年来

02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:31,432
你逐渐的建构了对我的仇恨
you've been building new hate for me, piece by piece.

我甚至不知道你是谁，因为你跟我一点都不像
l don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1135
02:13:35,306 --> 02:13:38,207
你是...别人的小孩
You're someone else's.

1136

这样的愤怒、这样的存心不良
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1137
02:13:44,216 --> 02:13:47,082
跟我完全没关系
Backwards dealings with me.

1138
02:13:48,753 --> 02:13:52,712
你是沙漠中某个篮子里的孤儿
You're an orphan from a basket in the middle of the desert.

1139
02:13:55,560 --> 02:14:00,520
我认养你没别的理由，只因我需要一张小孩脸好买地
And l took you for no other reason
than l needed a sweet face to buy land.

1140
02:14:02,033 --> 02:14:03,762
你明白没？
Did you get that?

1141
02:14:05,037 --> 02:14:06,902
现在你知道了
So now you know.

1142
02:14:10,074 --> 02:14:14,408
看着我，你连废物都算不上
Look at me! You're lower than a bastard.

1143
02:14:39,371 --> 02:14:43,807
你跟我一点都不像，你只是某个篮子里的废物
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1144
02:14:53,519 --> 02:14:57,784
感谢上帝我一点都不像你
l thank God l have none of you in me.

1145
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:07,121
不是我儿子，只是一个没力的竞争对手
Not my son. Just a little piece of competition.

1146
02:15:09,033 --> 02:15:11,127
篮子里的废物
Bastard from a basket.

1147
02:15:13,538 --> 02:15:15,769
篮子里的废物
Bastard from a basket!

1148
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:26,673
你是篮子里的废物
You're a bastard from a basket!

1149
02:16:29,247 --> 02:16:31,181
醒醒，丹尼尔先生
Get up, Mr. Daniel.

1150
02:16:35,421 --> 02:16:37,149
丹尼尔先生

1151
02:16:38,924 --> 02:16:41,518
丹尼尔先生，你有访客

1152
02:16:45,164 --> 02:16:47,029
醒醒，先生

1153
02:16:49,735 --> 02:16:51,326
先生？
Sir?

1154
02:17:04,816 --> 02:17:06,751
你可以退下了
You can leave us now.

1155
02:17:15,059 --> 02:17:16,152
丹尼尔
Daniel.

1156
02:17:19,298 --> 02:17:20,458
丹尼尔
Daniel.

1157
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:26,364
丹尼尔普兰优的房子失火了!
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1158
02:17:31,042 --> 02:17:34,034
丹尼尔兄弟，我是伊莱
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1159
02:17:44,323 --> 02:17:48,020
是的，你是
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1160
02:17:50,162 --> 02:17:52,061
我弄点喝的吧
l'll make us a drink.

1161
02:17:58,671 --> 02:18:01,799
你家真神奇
Your home is a miracle.

02:18:03,041 --> 02:18:04,668
真美
lt's beautiful.

1163
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:07,369
上帝庇佑它
God bless it.

1164
02:18:07,513 --> 02:18:11,505
我四处传播他的话语
l've been spreading His word far and wide.

1165
02:18:12,817 --> 02:18:14,614
四处传播
Far and wide.

1166
02:18:16,388 --> 02:18:19,152
为他旅行各处
So much travel for Him.

1167
02:18:23,861 --> 02:18:26,296
我在广播电台做过
l've been working in radio.

1168
02:18:29,001 --> 02:18:32,959
发生了...发生了好多事
Yes, so much... So much has been happening.

1169
02:18:34,005 --> 02:18:39,467
到这里，找到你，看到你还好真的很棒
To be here and find you and see you well is wonderful.

1170
02:18:39,645 --> 02:18:42,170
我们也有机会叙叙旧
And we have a chance to catch up.

1171
02:18:55,293 --> 02:18:57,387
不了，谢谢
No. Thank you so much.

1172
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:17,141
我的兄弟
My brother.

1173
02:19:18,416 --> 02:19:21,647
丹尼尔，我的姻亲
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1174
02:19:23,655 --> 02:19:27,784
我们真是老朋友了，这么多往日时光
We're such old friends. So much time.

1175
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:37,393
世事多变
Things go up, things go down,

1176
02:19:37,503 --> 02:19:41,836
但至少主总是与我们同在
but at least the Lord is always around.

1177
02:19:43,407 --> 02:19:46,103
我们历经了人生起伏，不是吗？
We've seen ups and downs, haven't we?

1178
02:19:49,915 --> 02:19:52,884
你现在混得不好了，伊莱？
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1179
02:19:54,253 --> 02:19:55,777
没有
No. No.

1180
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:00,718
不过我的确带来了悲伤的消息
But l do come with some sad news.

1181
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:05,191
也许你还记得班迪先生？
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1182
02:20:07,865 --> 02:20:11,199
班迪先生蒙主恩宠了
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1183
02:20:12,103 --> 02:20:15,231
他于99岁辞世，上帝保佑他
He lived to be 99 years old, God bless him.

1184
02:20:15,941 --> 02:20:19,843
班迪先生有个孙子，你见过他孙子威廉吗？
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1185
02:20:20,845 --> 02:20:25,407
威廉班迪是我们第三启示教堂
William Bandy is one of the finest members we have

1186
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:28,075
最优秀的成员之一
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1187
02:20:28,219 --> 02:20:31,519
他很想到好莱坞演电影
He's eager to come to Hollywood to be in movies.

1188
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:35,152
他的面貌非常俊秀

02:20:37,228 --> 02:20:42,256
-而我认为他会成功 -那太好了
-And l do think he will have success.
-That's wonderful.

1190
02:20:44,369 --> 02:20:47,166
你要我跟他谈吗？
Would you like me to speak with him?

1191
02:20:54,712 --> 02:20:59,445
丹尼尔，我是在问你想不想
Daniel, l'm asking if you'd like to have business

1192
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:01,815
跟第三启示教堂一起携手
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1193
02:21:01,953 --> 02:21:06,152
开发小班迪的土地？
in developing this lease on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1194
02:21:08,627 --> 02:21:10,254
我在提议让你钻探
l'm offering you to drill

1195
02:21:10,361 --> 02:21:13,819
小波士顿未开发土地的精华之一
on one of the great undeveloped fields of Little Boston.

1196
02:21:13,966 --> 02:21:18,061
-我很乐意跟你合作 -你愿意？
-l'd be happy to work with you. -You would?

1197
02:21:19,638 --> 02:21:22,470
是啊，当然，那太好了
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1198
02:21:22,608 --> 02:21:25,576
不过这合作有个条件
But there is one condition for this work.

1199
02:21:25,676 --> 02:21:27,166
好的
All right.

1200
02:21:29,281 --> 02:21:32,772
我要你告诉我你是个假先知
l'd like you to tell me that you are a false prophet.

1201
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:43,559
我要你告诉我你是，以前也是一个假先知
l'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1202
02:21:44,763 --> 02:21:47,129
还有上帝是个迷信
And that God is a superstition.

1203
02:21:53,272 --> 02:21:55,068
那可是谎言
But that's a lie.

1204
02:21:57,843 --> 02:22:00,403
那是谎言，我说不出口
lt's a lie. l cannot say it.

1205
02:22:14,692 --> 02:22:17,093
-我们何时可以开始钻探？ -很快
-When can we begin to drill? -Very soon.

1206
02:22:17,194 --> 02:22:18,855
油井要多久才能量产？
How long will it take to bring in the well?

1207
02:22:18,963 --> 02:22:20,828
应该不用多久
lt shouldn't take long.

1208
02:22:20,966 --> 02:22:24,264
我想要十万签约金
l would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1209
02:22:24,403 --> 02:22:27,600
加上你欠我的五千元本利
plus the five that is owed to me with interest.

1210
02:22:28,307 --> 02:22:30,103
那很公平
That's only fair.

1211
02:22:35,846 --> 02:22:40,613
我是假先知，上帝也是迷信
l am a false prophet, and God is a superstition.

1212
02:22:40,786 --> 02:22:43,754
如果你这么想，我就说
lf that's what you believe, then l will say it.

1213
02:22:43,854 --> 02:22:47,313
-真心诚意的说 -丹尼尔
-Say it like you mean it. -Daniel.

1214
02:22:47,893 --> 02:22:50,225
就像你讲道一样
Say it like it's your sermon.

1215
02:22:53,397 --> 02:22:55,024
别笑
Don't smile.

1216
02:23:00,806 --> 02:23:02,706
我是假先知
l am a false prophet.

1217
02:23:02,808 --> 02:23:06,140
-上帝是迷信 -你何不站起来
-God is a superstition. -Why don't you stand up?

1218
02:23:09,246 --> 02:23:11,237
把杯子放下
Put your glass down.

1219
02:23:23,361 --> 02:23:26,957
我是假先知
l am a false prophet.

1220
02:23:27,065 --> 02:23:30,158
-上帝是迷信 -伊莱，停
-God is a superstition. -Eli, stop.

1221
02:23:30,301 --> 02:23:35,672
想像这里是你的教堂，你的教徒满坑满谷
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1222
02:23:38,209 --> 02:23:41,976
我是假先知，上帝是迷信
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.

1223
02:23:42,079 --> 02:23:43,740
再说一次
Say it again.

1224
02:23:44,716 --> 02:23:48,618
我是假先知，上帝是迷信
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.

1225
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:49,879
后面的听不见
They can't hear you at the back.

1226
02:23:49,987 --> 02:23:53,320
我是假先知，上帝是迷信
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.

1227
02:23:53,492 --> 02:23:54,549
再说一次
Say it again.

1228
02:23:54,658 --> 02:23:59,289
我是假先知，上帝是迷信
l am a false prophet! God is a superstition!

1229
02:23:59,397 --> 02:24:01,093
再说一次
Say it again.

1230
02:24:01,199 --> 02:24:04,930
我是假先知，上帝是迷信
l am a false prophet! God is a superstition!

1231
02:24:06,138 --> 02:24:08,469
那里的地已经被钻探过了
Those areas have been drilled.

1232
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:13,042
什么？
What?

1233
02:24:13,145 --> 02:24:15,738
那里的地，已经钻探过了
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1234
02:24:17,349 --> 02:24:20,876
-不，并没有 -有的
-No, they haven't. -Yes, it's...

1235
02:24:20,986 --> 02:24:22,351
那叫汲取
lt's called drainage, Eli.

1236
02:24:22,453 --> 02:24:27,254
我拥有附近的地，当然就能得到下面的东西
See, l own everything around it, so,
of course, l get what's underneath it.

1237
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:31,888
不过那里没有钻油井
But there are no derricks there.

1238
02:24:32,030 --> 02:24:34,430
我说的是班迪的地，你明白吗？
This is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?

1239
02:24:34,532 --> 02:24:36,523
伊莱，你明白吗？
Do you understand, Eli?

1240
02:24:37,269 --> 02:24:40,466
不止是那样，你明白吗？
That's more to the point. Do you understand?

1241
02:24:40,604 --> 02:24:45,975
我喝了你的水，我每天都喝
l drink your water. l drink it up every day.

1242
02:24:46,977 --> 02:24:51,244
我喝了班迪那块地的羔羊宝血
l drink the blood of Lamb from Bandy's tract.

1243
02:24:56,487 --> 02:24:58,581
你可以坐下了
You can sit down again.

1244
02:25:16,774 --> 02:25:18,105
丹尼尔
Daniel.

1245
02:25:21,413 --> 02:25:22,402
丹尼尔
Daniel.

1246
02:25:26,283 --> 02:25:27,876
求求你
Please.

1247
02:25:30,221 --> 02:25:34,556
-我很绝望 -我知道
-l am in desperate times. -l know.

1248
02:25:34,692 --> 02:25:37,490
-我需要朋友 -当然，你需要
-l need a friend. -Yes. Of course, you do.

1249
02:25:37,896 --> 02:25:39,487
我有罪
l've sinned.

1250
02:25:41,233 --> 02:25:44,326
我需要帮忙，我是罪人
l need help. l'm a sinner.

1251
02:25:44,435 --> 02:25:49,066
我让恶魔以我无法想像的方法掌握住我
l've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways l never imagined.

1252
02:25:49,207 --> 02:25:50,605
我满身是罪
l'm so full of sin.

1253
02:25:50,709 --> 02:25:53,974
上帝有时会挑战我们，不是吗？
The Lord sometimes challenges us, doesn't He, Eli?

1254
02:25:54,111 --> 02:25:56,102
-是的，他会 -是的，他会
-Yes, He does, Daniel. -Yes, He does.

1255
02:25:56,213 --> 02:25:58,738
是的，他会
Yes, He does!

1256
02:25:58,916 --> 02:26:00,816
是的，他会
Yes, He does!

1257
02:26:02,086 --> 02:26:07,683
他完全没有警告我最近的经济恐慌
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1258
02:26:07,825 --> 02:26:09,952
-而这一切... -亲爱的
-And this... -Oh, dear.

1259
02:26:10,094 --> 02:26:16,727
我一定要开发这块地，我一定要、一定要开发
l must have this, Daniel. l must, l must, l must have this.

1260
02:26:16,902 --> 02:26:19,165
我的投资都...
My investments have...

1261
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:24,334
我不逼你，不过若我能抓住上帝帮助的手
Daniel, l won't bore you, but if l could
grab the Lord's hand for help l would,

1262
02:26:24,476 --> 02:26:27,343
他常行如此神迹
but He does these things all the time.

1263
02:26:27,478 --> 02:26:31,380
他现出了那些神迹，我们等待...
These mysteries that He presents, and while we wait...

1264
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:34,844
我们等待他的指示
While we wait for His word!

1265
02:26:34,986 --> 02:26:37,950
因为你不是上帝的兄弟，伊莱
Because you're not the chosen brother, Eli.

1266
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:44,157
上帝的兄弟是保罗
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1267
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:47,965
他告诉我地的事，你只是个笨蛋
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1268
02:26:48,066 --> 02:26:50,933
-你为什么要说保罗？ -我做了你兄弟做不到的事
-Why are you talking about Paul?
-l did what your brother couldn't.

1269
02:26:51,036 --> 02:26:53,527
-别对我说这个 -我让你破产还打了你
-Don't say this to me.
-l broke you and l beat you.

1270
02:26:54,471 --> 02:26:57,270
保罗先把你的事告诉了我
lt was Paul told me about you.

1271
02:26:57,375 --> 02:27:01,834
他才是先知，他才有脑袋，他早知道那里有什么
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1272
02:27:01,979 --> 02:27:04,345
他找我去把地下的东西挖出来
and he found me to take it out of the ground.

1273
02:27:04,481 --> 02:27:07,507
知道最好笑的是什么吗？听着
Know what the funny thing is? Listen, listen.

1274
02:27:08,386 --> 02:27:12,322
我当面给了他一万元现金，就这样
l paid him $10,000 cash in hand. Just like that.

1275
02:27:13,358 --> 02:27:16,656
他现在拥有自己的公司，不错的小事业
He has his own company now. Prosperous little business.

1276
02:27:16,795 --> 02:27:20,322
三口井量产，每周五千元
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1277
02:27:22,367 --> 02:27:26,166
别哀嚎了，你这个爱哭鬼。别胡闹了
Stop crying, you sniveling ass. Stop your nonsense.

1278
02:27:27,371 --> 02:27:31,273
- 你只是个胎盘，伊莱 - 不
-You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
