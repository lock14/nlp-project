00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,544
<i>- How was it?
- (man) I played this game. "Stay Alive."</i>

3
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,912
<i>Seriously, man,
the sickest shit since Fatal Frame.</i>

4
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,213
It was creepy. Really creepy.

5
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,824
Are you gonna make it over here? Can you
come over? You wanna come over?

6
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,923
Dude, look, I'll come up this weekend,
we'll burn it solid.

7
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:12,111
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Late.

8
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,669
- Shit, man. Don't you knock?
- All right. Whoops.

9
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,368
- Shut the door, perv.
- I found you in the game. You got it good.

10
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,757
We haven't played for hours.

11
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
OK.

12
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,200
It is not real. Don't freak.

13
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:54,092
- Hello?

14
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,139
- Hello?

15
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,712
Rex?

16
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,612
Sar...

17
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:06,164
Sarah?

18
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,544
Rex! No!

19
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:11,267
Please!

20
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,461
Oh!

21
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,304
- That was fast.
- Hi. How are you?

22
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:05,216
- Did you take care of the marina report?
- I was just about to.

23
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,158
Oh, don't bother.

24
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,353
He wants to see you right away,
and he's in one of his moods.

25
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,136
<i>- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Oh, merci. Darling.</i>

26
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,729
Hi.

27
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:24,352
- I was just gonna...
- Over a month.

28
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,784
That's how long
I've been working on this.

29
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,408
That's 100... that's 100 hours.

30
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,608
Right? That's, uh...

31
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm sorry. I'll finish
the marina report as soon as possible.

32
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,602
The ma... The what?

33
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,656
- Marina report?
- Yeah.

34
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,256
Oh, man.

35
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:43,759
Hm.

36
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,088
- Hutch.
- What?

37
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:48,350
You know what?
Have a seat. Enjoy yourself. OK?

38
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:53,631
All right, listen to me now, OK? I hired you
for one reason, and one reason only.

39
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,599
Now, the walk-through says
I dump the ammo and the boss dies.

40
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,380
<i>I'm sorry. We're not still talking
about Silent Hill 4, are we?</i>

41
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,174
Yes.

42
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,247
OK. Damn. All right. Uh... I don't know what
else to tell you. You got the hyperblaster?

43
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,360
Do I look like an asshole?
Yes, I have the hyperblaster.

44
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,392
Right, OK. Yeah, dump it.

45
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:17,535
I mean, it's got unlimited ammo,
nullifies the... Hey, can I get tomorrow off?

46
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,608
Let me think about that.

47
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,048
No, no, no.
I need it to get to the final boss.

48
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:26,022
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.

49
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,600
You know, Hutch, if you put as much effort
into clerking as you did into gaming,

50
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
you could end up like me someday.
You know that, right?

51
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,011
OK.

52
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:36,445
All right, you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?

53
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:39,223
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.

54
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:44,128
So lose it right before going down the
stairs. She'll die on her own. Game over.

55
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,039
All right. OK. Hey, man,
are you hip to this PDA sex thing?

56
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,887
- I haven't got into that.
- You've got a phone call, Hutch.

57
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,149
Thank you.

58
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,064
<i>(man) I think that's a vegetable.</i>

59
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:58,873
Hello?

60
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,426
What?

61
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:32,671
Oh, Hutch. I'm so glad that you came.
It means so much to me.

62
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,020
<i>(vicar) Today we lay to rest
Loomis Crowley...</i>

63
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,509
<i>(vicar continues)</i>

64
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,607
- Did you just take a picture of me?
- I did.

65
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:59,175
There are so many crying faces
at this funeral and you seem the saddest,

66
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,248
but you weren't crying,

67
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,558
so I took a picture.

68
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:08,761
- You and Loomis must have been close.
- Yeah, we were close.

69
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,815
<i>I mean, we were so close, but...
Did you know Loomis?</i>

70
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,604
Kinda.

71
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,468
I grew up with Sarah back in Georgia. I was
supposed to hang out with her that night.

72
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,502
Really? Yeah, so was I.

73
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:28,160
I always thought I'd be taking pictures
on her wedding day, not her funeral.

74
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,592
- Looks like you're up.
- Emma. Hi.

75
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,703
- Hi.
- How are you? God, look at you.

76
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,743
You're so grown-up.
How are you doing?

77
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm OK. Um, here.

78
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:42,365
This is your brother's bag.
You don't want this?

79
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,942
Mom and Dad won't let me play those
video games. They were gonna toss 'em.

80
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,640
You know, they're too violent.
Besides, he would want you to have 'em.

81
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,061
Come here. Take care, all right?

82
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,207
<i>(Emma) OK.</i>

83
00:10:55,823 --> 00:11:00,855
Here. If you need to talk,
that's my number.

84
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:28,916
- Hey, sunshine.
- Hey.

85
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,007
Didn't think you'd be back so soon.

86
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,750
Give us a kiss.

87
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:40,191
- Sorry, Hutch. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to believe.

88
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,656
Tragedy, Hutch.
I tell you, bro, first your parents, now this.

89
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:44,832
God dealt the straws
and gave you a short one, man.

90
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,237
You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth

91
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:51,905
is that stupid insensitive shit
comes out of it. You're an idiot.

92
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:55,328
Be strong - that's all I'm saying. You know
what I mean, bro? You're a rock. I love you.

93
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,542
- I love you too.
- Who talks to their brother like that?

94
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,440
- Somebody with an idiot for a brother.
- Oh, my God, you're a terrible person.

95
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,382
So, do they know what happened yet?

96
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,015
All I know is that he was murdered -
him and two of his friends.

97
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:08,920
- That's awful.
- What's in the bag?

98
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:12,328
- Games, pictures, crap like that.
- From Loomis?

99
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,235
Yeah.

100
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:19,098
- No shit! Is this you two?
- Yeah.

101
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:22,616
Look at that.

102
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,464
Lighter works.

103
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,431
- Gorgeous.
- Dude, you can keep that if you like it.

104
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,148
- I'm sorry, Hutch.
- You must have been adopted.

105
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,263
Thank you, Loomis.

106
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:40,270
- So he was a real gamer, huh?
- Yeah.

107
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,303
- Any good titles in the bag?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

108
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,059
Goddamn, y'all.

109
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,455
<i>Stay Alive? Never heard of it.</i>

110
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,527
Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out the night he died.

111
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:53,211
He asked me to come over and play.
I totally blew him off.

112
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,191
- Hutch, come on. You didn't know.
- I know. It's just...

113
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,875
- How'd he get his hands on it?
- He did some beta-testing.

114
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:03,488
I beta-tested for a while. It's awesome
at first, then it's goddamn monotonous.

115
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,624
- Let's burn a round for Loomis.
- Are you an idiot?

116
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:10,500
I told you, that'd be weird.
That was the last thing he was doing.

117
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,105
Hey, sack up, bro.

118
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:17,138
If Loomis was indeed testing this game,
that means it is barely legal.

119
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:20,566
Yeah, this could be nice.

120
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:50,009
- Hey.
- Jesus Christ!

121
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,211
Can Hutch come out and play?

122
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,450
Swink,
you scared the crap out of me, man.

123
00:13:56,783 --> 00:14:00,863
Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.

124
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,464
I wanna make sure we're all set up.

125
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:04,991
So, uh...

126
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,808
I'm sorry, you know,
about your friend and all.

127
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:09,302
It...

128
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:11,934
stinks.

129
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,956
Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good. No worries.

130
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,111
It'll be good to hang out with you guys,
get my mind off things.

131
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,119
Hey. Ooh.

132
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,870
Dollface, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

133
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:27,161
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas, this is Abigail.

134
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,463
She's kind of a friend of Loomis's.
She's gonna hang out for a while.

135
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:33,088
- What's up, mama?
- What's up? I gotta pee.

136
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,719
- Oh, yeah. It's right down the hallway.
- Oh, sorry.

137
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,280
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

138
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:40,780
Girl has got body karate going on.

139
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,225
Anyone who says size doesn't matter
never played a third-person shooter.

140
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:48,857
You're a whore.

141
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,941
- Here.
- No.

142
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:55,739
<i>- What did you say?
- (Abigail) Hey.</i>

143
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,596
God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.

144
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,695
- Don't worry, I'll get your back.
- Sweet Sebastian Bach, I wanna play.

145
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,840
- Bossman hooking up tonight?
- Miller, you signed in? You there?

146
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,912
Yeah, I'm here.

147
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:15,261
Yeah, Loretta called my wife, told her
I got caught up in a partner meeting.

148
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,252
<i>All right, guys. Enough chatter.
The name of this game is Stay Alive.</i>

149
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:24,127
We don't know much else,
other than we're not supposed to have it.

150
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,111
Sit back down.

151
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:28,455
Bro!

152
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,731
<i>(Phin) Let's do it.</i>

153
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,270
- Dude.
- Put your hands on it.

154
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:35,670
- Disgusting.
- Touch it.

155
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,661
She's stubborn.
Isn't letting me get to the game.

156
00:15:56,716 --> 00:16:00,888
Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.

157
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,491
- Just a thought.
- Voice-activated? No way.

158
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,193
- That's next-generation technology.
- OK.

159
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,407
"Come to me, clouds."

160
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,414
Whoa.

161
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:16,569
- What?
- It's... it's like a séance or...

162
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:21,676
Can we skip this bullshit cinematic
foreplay? I wanna butter this muffin.

163
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,600
- OK. Let's go. Everybody say this, right?
- OK.

164
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,087

<i>200 years ago.
Countess Elizabeth Bathory</i>

178

<i>opened Gerouge
as a finishing school for young...</i>

179
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,746
- Gerouge.
- You've heard of it?

180
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,279
Yeah. Grandma used to tell us if we didn't
get home before dark, we'd get taken off...

181
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,447
Yeah, but do you remember Grandma
used to wear panties on the outside?

182
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:35,546
Seriously, though, I know this, guys.
I've heard this story.

183
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,879
<i>(voice) What happened to those girls
was so depraved</i>

184
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:41,912
<i>that all accounts were stricken

185
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,815
<i>The evil of Gerouge has been reborn.</i>

186
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,831
<i>Your salvation lies
beyond the gates of this plantation.</i>

187
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:52,973
<i>Your only chance is this:</i>

188
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,159
<i>Uncover the horrible truth about
Gerouge Plantation and stop the evil.</i>

189
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,264
<i>But. In order to do that.</i>

190
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,703
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

191
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:08,588
- My God.
- I'm starting to get a little creeped out.

192
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,815
- Sh!
- Shut the hell up.

193
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,791
<i>- (Phin) Where the hell are you going?
- Just trying to figure it out.</i>

194
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:21,370
<i>- (Hutch) What is that?
- Whoa.</i>

195
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,972
- You guys feel that?
- Hell, yeah. Feel it in my pants, baby.

196
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,983
<i>- Must mean we're close to something.
- (Swink) Or something's close to us.</i>

197
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,056
Uh, you better pull your weapon, bro.

198
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,970
- Somebody do something. Swink?
- No, I'm good.

199
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,157
How do you kill her?
She's already dead. Look out!

200
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,767
<i>(man) When fear cripples you.
When death's shadow surrounds you.</i>

201
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,912
<i>Drop a rose.</i>

202
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:58,584
<i>It will help you stay alive.</i>

203
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:01,299
Right. It'll give us a chance
to escape ghosts we can't face.

204
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,904
Undead can't cross
the twig of a wild rose.

205
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:09,503
That is what you learn when you read
too much goth chick-lit. Lay off the incense.

206
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,031
And the game's fun,
but it kind of moves along at a snail's pace.

207
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,399
<i>(Phin) Left, go left.
Left! On your left!</i>

208
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,701
Left! Left!
Goddamn it, you noob!

209
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,859
<i>(Phin) OK. And you eat my nails.
And you eat my nails.</i>

210
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:24,371
<i>Go round the mausoleum. Man.
Nice. And eat this.</i>

211
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,391
Come on! Sweet Jesus, these dead bitches
are coming out in droves.

212
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,563
<i>Miller. The Bathory tomb.
In front of you.</i>

213
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:33,151
<i>Do not close the door. Man.
Do not close the door. No! Oh. My God!</i>

214
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,706
Hello, Mumsy.

215
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,799
- Whoa, whoa. What's that?
- What's... where?

216
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,727
- There. Is something in that wardrobe?
- Oh, nice eye.

217
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,353
<i>(Abigail) Thank you.</i>

218
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:53,381
<i>- Congrats, Abs.
- (Abigail) It's a secret room or something.</i>

219
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,206
<i>- (Abigail) Is that a diary?
- (October) Yeah.</i>

220
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,734
The one from the beginning
with the prayer in it.

221
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,336
<i>- (Hutch) Miller. Are you OK?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.</i>

222
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,465
Are you in those tunnels again? There is
no action there. The doors are locked.

223
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:20,255
Well, they're open now.
You know, I'm exploring, tearing shit up.

224
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,360
- Ownin' fools.
- "Ownin' fools"?

225
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,553
- I'm telling you, my controller is vibrating.
- You'd better drop a rose.

226
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:35,127
Now I'm out of... I'm out of...
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.

227
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:40,567
- Tell us what you see before you book it.
- Some sort of sick torture room or...

228
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:45,146
God, man.
I just saw a flash of dead girls, or...

229
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,647
Goddammit, man.

230
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,954
<i>- She got me.
- (Abigail) One of the girls?</i>

231
00:20:54,979 --> 00:21:00,051
Some woman, man. I think it was the dame
from the painting. You know, that countess.

232
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,755
I didn't even
get a chance to fight her, man.

233
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:06,047
- Where's the torture chamber?
- I went through a secret entrance.

234
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,191
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?

235
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,668
Well...

236
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:13,358
Hey, is somebody out there?

237
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,649
<i>- (Hutch) Miller. Who are you talking to?
- I don't know.</i>

238
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,959
Probably some goddamn rent-a-cop
trying to scare the shit out of the living.

239
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,287
You know what they say. You play
the game too long, you start seeing shit.

240
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,549
<i>- You know, or have seizures.
- (Swink) Games could cause seizures.</i>

241
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:35,807
Perceptive reality, on the other hand,
has yielded some interesting studies.

242
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,815
<i>- (Phin) And you've read them all.
- I have. It seems the longer you play,</i>

243
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:41,750
the more your mind
perceives the game world to be a reality.

244
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:47,167
It's interesting, but it's only a theory.
But then there's retinal memory, which...

245
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,599
That is so fascinating, sweetie,
but I'm feeling like we should call it a night.

246
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,966
Yeah, some of us
have gotta be at work.

247
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,815
<i>All right.
Miller. You can rejoin us. Then.</i>

248
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,270
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.

249
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,959
Thanks again for hanging, you guys.
I really needed it.

250
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:04,195
<i>- To Loomis.
- (all) To Loomis.</i>

251
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:09,140
To Loomis.

252
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:13,402
Perceptive reality.

253
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,678
- Hutch!
- Loretta.

254
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,276
<i>- What's going on? What's going on?
- (sobs)</i>

255
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:40,439
- What's going on?
- It's Miller.

256
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,500
Miller?

257
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:46,361
Miller. Miller!

258
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:48,583
Hey, it's a crime scene.
You have to clear out.

259
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,493
Can I get a damn curtain over here?

260
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:54,120
- I just spoke to him a few hours ago.
- Whoa. A few hours ago?

261
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:59,182
- Get off me.
- All right, buddy. Come on. Come on.

262
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,092
Thanks.

263
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,535
I know this kind of thing ain't easy, son.
I'm gonna try to be quick about it.

264
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:12,317
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?

265
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,399
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.

266
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,773
Oh.

267
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:21,431
His wife said that he was working late.

268
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:27,647
Yeah, sorry. What I meant was, he was
playing from here and I was at my place.

269
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:30,503
- Just the two of you?
- I was with four friends. We were online.

270
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,291
Uh-huh.

271
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:35,262
- Make sure we get those names.
- Roger that.

272
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,875
- Do you live close by?
- Yeah, uptown. Off Magazine.

273
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,047
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.

274
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:44,779
Those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime.

275
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,846
Charlie, chill.

276
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:51,534
- I just wanna know what happened to him.
- All right, now.

277
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:56,095
OK, if you ever need to give me a call,

278
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,583
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.

279
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,263
I may need to speak with you again.

280
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,822
And I'm sorry about your friend.

281
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:06,677
Thanks.

282
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:09,564
All right.

283
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:29,077
Sweet shit! Get a load of this!

284
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:33,127
I think I've found bossman's body.

285
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,680
- Oh, God!
- That's off-putting.

286
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:39,131
- Didn't you just say Miller was stabbed?
- Man, I can't look at this.

287
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,704
I'll have to quit
hanging around with you.

288
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:44,167
I'm sorry. Phin, if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.

289
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:47,274
Now shut the goddamn game up.

290
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:50,719
- Because we found Miller's body in it?
- It is a horror survival game.

291
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,958
I hate to be a dick, but I think
you guys are overreacting a little bit.

292
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,130
- Would you show some respect, man?
- Respect?

293
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:59,548
You pay respect to gamers by gaming,
so let's boot it up. To Miller.

294
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:04,981
- You're not playing for Miller or Loomis.
- You didn't even know those guys, right?

295
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:07,902
If you wanna curl up in the fetal position
for the day, fine, but don't expect me to.

296
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:10,959
As for you,
I just met you yesterday, so kiss my ass.

297
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,341
- Phin!
- What?

298
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:16,150
Look, why don't you guys get out of here
and let me play in peace?

299
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:20,525
Peace.

300
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,941
Hey, take it easy.

301
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,332
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,157
Are you OK?

303
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:43,519
- I'm just having a hard time, you know?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,631
Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,

305
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,671
other than you can't game for shit.

306
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,598
Well, I grew up in Georgia.

307
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:55,519
My dad's an architect and my mom's
a kindergarten schoolteacher.

308
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,828
I'm going to Princeton in the fall.

309
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:00,371
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family.

310
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,925
I don't know about perfect.

311
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,909
- Uh...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

312
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,819
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

313
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:14,022
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.

314
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:16,932
What's up?

315
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,645
Finding Miller's body in the game...

316
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:29,118
Look, I'm no gamer, but there are only so
many ways you could die in a video game.

317
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:32,380
It's all just really bad timing.

318
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,370
Not really. In a sense, the timing is bad
because he overresponds to deaths.

319
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:39,999
But the coincidence of finding Miller's
game body and his real body was perfect.

320
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:43,428
That's why we're freaked out.

321
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:47,293
It's better in single player anyway.

322
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,864
Dickheads.

323
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:56,155
All right, Countess, let's go.

324
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,918
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.

325
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:04,277
<i>- You can't break this one.
- (horse neighs)</i>

326
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:08,858
Maybe timing had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was inevitable.

327
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:11,686
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.

328
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,279
Where are you going?

329
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:19,838
Loomis and his friends were playing that
video game the night they died. Now Miller.

330
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:22,502
What are the chances of all of them being
murdered right after playing that game?

331
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:23,474
Jesus, if Phineus is playing...

332
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:28,070
- Come on, honey. You've gotta relax.
- It's just bad timing.

333
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,092
Swink said
maybe timing has nothing to do with it.

334
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,182
Did I say that? I have a penchant
for big theories. Don't listen to me.

335
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:43,131
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!

336
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,206
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm pulling this bitch. What's it look like?

337
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,108
- What if Loomis and Miller...
- Was more than a coincidence?

338
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:56,318
They both played the game
and then they died, so...

339
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:58,957
obviously the video game
killed them, right?

340
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,689
- Are you serious, man? Listen to yourself.
- Phin.

341
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:04,798
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Check this mirror I found.

342
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:09,436
I flipped it. The back works like a mirror,
but it won't break like the others.

343
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:14,560
I think it's made out of polished silver.
I don't know. You guys don't have one.

344
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:21,788
You've been through a lot and I love you,
but you're freaking everybody out now.

345
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,462
I know. Yeah.

346
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,971
Nice.

347
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,033
"No distinguishing marks."

348
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:14,298
Had a broken banister.

349
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:35,076
"Adjoined twin blades."

350
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,015
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap-up?

351
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:14,054
Hot sugar.
We had this conversation.

352
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:17,343
Call me crazy, call me paranoid,
I don't give a shit. Just look at this.

353
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,967
- Why isn't Phineus showing?
- He said he'd be here, so he'll be here.

354
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:23,120
OK. So we all saw
that Miller was stabbed to death.

355
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,142
The cops think he was stabbed
with shears. Loomis's friends too.

356
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:28,859
Sarah - her body was drained of blood.

357
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,830
The police report said Loomis's neck
was broken, and he was hung in the game.

358
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,678
They all died
the same way they died in the game.

359
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:38,446
This can't just be some coincidence.

360
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:42,919
I don't like this at all.

361
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,021
I think you're right.

362
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:53,014
You know I told you I heard
the story of Gerouge from my grandma?

363
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,271
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted - and very real.

364
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:02,362
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.

365
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,478
The tower,
the cemetery, the torture chamber.

366
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,918
She'd hunt for victims in a black carriage.

367
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,230
She'd gut them with silver shears. The
shattered mirrors, why were they broken?

368
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,947
She couldn't stand to see herself get old.
All facts.

369
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,030
All I care about is finding out
what happened to Miller and Loomis,

370
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,590
and you are not helping.

371
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:24,410
As punishment, they walled the bitch up
in her tower alive - and here's the kicker.

372
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,566
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.

373
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:32,158
So what if she's back and killing us
one by one after we die in the game?

374
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:35,679
This is insane. Listen to yourself.

375
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:40,247
You don't want to listen to me, fine. All
I care about is: Where the hell is Phineus?

376
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,294
<i>(sings along to stereo) # Close your eyes,
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams</i>

377
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:54,648
# Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams

378
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,020
Funky.

379
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,262
Is anybody out there?

380
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:35,927
Phin, are you OK?

381
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,616
<i>- Yeah. I'm awesome.
- Phin, it's Hutch. Where are you?</i>

382
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:41,465
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck out on River Road.

383
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:44,318
- I'm just south of Binky's Adult Store.
- I'll drive.

384
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:46,334
<i>- Who's that? Abigail?
- Yeah.</i>

385
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,276
<i>- What's up, mama?
- What's up?</i>

386
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,900
Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality,

387
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,398
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things, or both?

388
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:58,400
<i>Both. It's bizarre.
Retinally speaking...</i>

389
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:02,270
Shut up. I've not tripped out like this
since I ate that matzo ball at Bible camp.

390
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,606
<i>(October) Hey. Phin. Hang on.
We're coming to get you.</i>

391
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,297
Let's go.

392
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:10,171
<i>(October) You didn't die in the game.
I'll be right there.</i>

393
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:14,661
That's right!
I didn't die in the game, baby.

394
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,819
Hey.

395
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:51,254
Wait a minute.
In the game, she only comes at night.

396
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:06,810
Is anybody out there?

397
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:20,479
OK, we're close.
Look for his car.

398
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:26,454
Stop, stop, stop. Stop! Wait.

399
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,199
Phin!

400
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:37,308
<i>Phin. (sobs)</i>

401
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:59,190
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way he died in the game.

402
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,878
Need to tell me something?

403
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:05,016
This is...

404
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:08,508
This is gonna sound crazy,

405
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:11,774
<i>but this game, Stay Alive,</i>

406
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:13,950
is about the Gerouge Plantation

407
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,055
and a woman, Elizabeth Bathory.

408
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:21,578
- I think I know that ghost story, yeah.
- OK. Phineus was run over in the game.

409
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:24,790
Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.

410
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:30,270
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, kid.
- I got this game last week from a friend.

411
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,150
Him and two of his friends were murdered
the same way they died in the game.

412
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,059
Now, explain that.

413
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,885
Right.

414
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:42,836
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.

415
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:43,582
You lived with that family, right?
After what happened with your folks?

416
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:44,214
Yeah.

417
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,628
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?

418
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:53,243
You know I did, Detective.

419
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,089
<i>- Technically, anybody can hack into...
- (Thibodeaux) Shut up.</i>

420
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,899
Let's take a walk.

421
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:06,118
- Let's see why you're so scared.
- I don't think...

422
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:07,966
Shut up.

423
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:09,118
- How do you do this thing?
- You have to read that.

424
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:10,197
All right.

425
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:14,078
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."

426
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:16,412
There must be a connection.

427
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:20,539
- Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
- Look, I already told you...

428
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,646
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend, game or no game,

429
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,461
next time I see you on a crime scene,
I'm gonna take you in.

430
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:29,405
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.

431
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:32,094
- Someone you cared about, Detective.
- I would let the cops do their job.

432
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:33,523
Hey!

433
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:36,116
Hey, don't play that game.

434
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,683
Hey! Come on! Come on.

435
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,986
I just think
it would be better if no one plays.

436
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,989
I can see, at your tender age,
something like this might scare you.

437
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,230
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

438
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,401
All right.

439
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:54,974
I'm gonna look into this,
but you're gonna have to go home, Hutch.

440
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:56,665
Why don't you lock that kid up?

441
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,830
He rode up on a carriage
and mowed down the girl's brother?

442
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,034
This game business
sounds like bullshit.

443
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,902
<i>(Swink) That's great.
That's just really stupendous.</i>

444
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,104
I know it! We all know it!
Something's happening, something bad!

445
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,371
Swink, shut the hell up!

446
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:17,344
You're not helping, man.

447
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:24,470
Why did you have to bring that game
into our lives, Hutch?

448
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,582
Why?

449
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,621
October.

450
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:38,924
My brother was all that I had.

451
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:43,627
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.

452
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,979
October...

453
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,437
I didn't know.

454
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:08,994
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

455
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:17,217
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

456
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:23,127
Neither do I.

457
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,852
So we have to do something.

458
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:32,890
Hutch, I want you to find out
everything you can about this game.

459
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:35,741
OK. I can start with Loomis's house.

460
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,821
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of things for Phin.

461
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:41,829
Are you OK?
Are you sure you're up to this?

462
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,301
Hutch, somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.

463
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:48,902
I'm gonna find whoever did it
and hurt them.

464
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:50,929
OK.

465
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:54,104
Abigail, stay with Hutch.
But if anything happens to him...

466
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:56,895
And we don't play that game,
not for a second.

467
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,804
Hey, a little help here?

468
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,772
Let me guess.
Your wife and kids are driving you nuts.

469
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,870
Need something to take the edge off?
Something with a high frag-count.

470
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:14,238
- Do I look 12, man?
- I take it you don't play, then.

471
00:42:14,238 --> 00:42:16,669
<i>I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana Q *bert tournament.</i>

472
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:19,036
<i>- Oh, Q *bert, huh? Great.
- Yeah, listen.</i>

473
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:22,526
<i>I need information
on a horror game called Stay Alive.</i>

474
00:42:22,526 --> 00:42:24,605
<i>Stay Alive? Never heard of it.</i>

475
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:26,613
Maybe it's underground.

476
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,678
- Do you know who made it?
- Some basehead in his mom's attic.

477
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,430
You know, a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.

478
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,573
You wouldn't play a game
by Charlie Manson.

479
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:38,430
No. Probably not.

480
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,219
Maybe you already have.

481
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,435
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.

482
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:50,398
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.

483
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:53,213
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,

484
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,846
I'll talk to you in a little bit,
all right?

485
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,099
She must have left
at least one of these windows open.

486
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:14,206
- How do you know that?
- I lived with the Crowleys for a while.

487
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:16,115
Oh, yeah.

488
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:22,758
Yeah, it was like, you know,
Loomis's house just felt like home.

489
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:28,766
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...

490
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:31,701
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No.

491
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:35,031
My dad went a little nuts,

492
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:39,769
thought my mom was sleeping around,
which she wasn't.

493
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,834
He figured
if she wasn't gonna be with him,

494
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:44,990
she wouldn't be with anybody,

495
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,221
so he set the place on fire.

496
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,425
Just torched it.

497
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:54,765
The firemen barely got me out alive,
but my mom...

498
00:43:56,765 --> 00:44:00,061
She was still in bed
when they found her.

499
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:04,638
I tell myself if I'd been a little older
or a little braver,

500
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:06,809
I would've...

501
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:10,268
I would've stopped him.

502
00:44:10,846 --> 00:44:12,821
I didn't move.

503
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,386
When he gets out, he'll be 76.

504
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:18,002
Ain't nothing like family.

505
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:21,821
This window's open.

506
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:24,661
So that's why you're scared of fire?

507
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:27,581
That's why I hate fire.

508
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,886
- I'll go around to the front door, OK?
- OK.

509
00:44:58,886 --> 00:44:59,991
Come on.
Come on, come on.

510
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:04,230
Let's check out Loomis's room.

511
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,034
<i>(Abigail) What could we find in here
that the cops haven't already found?</i>

512
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:14,189
They didn't know where to look.

513
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,374
- Huh.
- What?

514
00:45:21,374 --> 00:45:23,283
What is it?

515
00:45:24,862 --> 00:45:27,486
<i>(Hutch) It's the game company
Loomis tested for, where he got the game.</i>

516
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,340
Scary.

517
00:45:30,117 --> 00:45:35,166
I found the address for the game company.
Tell me where 1420 Cypress Road is.

518
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,140
Not a problem.

519
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,206
Let's see. Take the Belle Chasse Highway
to Breaux Bridge, near Spanish Lake.

520
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,540
Look, we're heading
to the game developer.

521
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,454
<i>I've been reading this book
called The Malleus Demonium.</i>

522
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,821
<i>- (Hutch) What?
- It means "the witches' hammer."</i>

523
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,939
It was a handbook for witch hunters
in the Inquisition. It says if we find her,

524
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:58,493
we need to put three nails through
her heart, neck, and then forehead.

525
00:45:58,493 --> 00:46:01,341
The nails are gonna put
her human spirit back into her body,

526
00:46:01,438 --> 00:46:04,307
and then - this is really,
really important, you guys -

527
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:07,581
"An undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood."

528
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:10,134
So you think her ghost
could've been brought back?

529
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:15,965
It's like a séance. A strong enough spirit
can be brought back with the proper text.

530
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,058
I just can't believe this.

531
00:46:19,134 --> 00:46:22,477
<i>Detective Charles King
was murdered today at Clearwater Mall.</i>

532
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:23,749
October?

533
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:25,953
<i>Sources say
this murder may be linked...</i>

534
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:29,509
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.

535
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:31,233
What?

536
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:36,152
<i>- We've got another problem</i>

537
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:38,236
Oh, God. The police are here.

538
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,469
OK, OK. Meet us at Loomis's.

539
00:46:41,277 --> 00:46:43,437
<i>- (Swink) Loomis's?
- He's right.</i>

540
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:47,189
- If you don't wanna go to jail, go now.
- Jail?

541
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:50,518
Now! Come on!

542
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:54,925
<i>(October) Give it to me.</i>

543
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,694
Toss the apartment.

544
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:12,821
What have we got?

545
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:19,348
<i>- You remember her diary?
- (Abigail) Her diary?</i>

546
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,071
Yeah, in the game.

547
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:25,622
- What if that's it?
- What?

548
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,733
- The proper text.
- That would mean that...

549
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:32,391
This is not about some ghost.

550
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:36,154
You expect me to believe we conjured up
her evil spirit with a game séance?

551
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:41,725
- To start, we all had to recite that prayer.
- That just... It's highly unlikely.

552
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,508
What is it, Swink?

553
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,349
October and I were talking about this.
I don't know. Maybe she's onto something.

554
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,837
- Why is the game on?
- What?

555
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:52,787
The game.

556
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,547
I didn't turn it on.

557
00:47:57,054 --> 00:47:59,355
I told you not to play.

558
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:07,995
<i>- Where's October?
- (Swink) She's out smoking.</i>

559
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,358
But you said if we didn't play the game
we'd be fine. I thought those were the rules.

560
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,733
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe there aren't any rules.

561
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:37,042
October!

562
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,911
It's not possible.
I didn't play. None of us did.

563
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:44,498
- If nobody played the game, that means...
- The game's playing by itself.

564
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:37,446
OK.

565
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:03,722
October!

566
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:04,905
October!

567
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,148
Shit!

568
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:25,462
No!

569
00:50:29,877 --> 00:50:31,701
Let me go!

570
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,949
<i>- October!
- (Swink) October!</i>

571
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:39,378
October!

572
00:50:43,517 --> 00:50:45,721
Help me!

573
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,251
October!

574
00:50:52,422 --> 00:50:53,698
Let me go!

575
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:56,396
<i>- Open the window! Come on!</i>

576
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:02,152
Come on!

577
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,444
Go fuck yourself.

578
00:51:08,157 --> 00:51:09,367
Come on.

579
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,326
It's open. It's open.
October!

580
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:17,853
Oh, no! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

581
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:20,308
You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.

582
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:24,983
I can fix this. I can fix this. No, no, no, no.

583
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:28,349
Goddammit!
Please, don't do this to me!

584
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,933
- I shouldn't have left her alone.
- This isn't your fault, Swink.

585
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:50,486
This is all my fault.

586
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:54,641
You should've left
when you had the chance.

587
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:57,197
Your life was perfect before this.

588
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:02,745
My dad's not an architect.

589
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,509
- What?
- My dad's not an architect.

590
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:07,706
My mom doesn't teach first grade.

591
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:13,405
- You mean kindergarten?
- Whatever. I'm not heading to Princeton.

592
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:16,187
Pretty much
everything I said was bullshit.

593
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:21,270
- So this van is...
- Home sweet home.

594
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:27,029
I hate telling people the truth and
watching them get embarrassed for asking.

595
00:52:33,029 --> 00:52:35,069
We gotta end this.

596
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:37,947
We gotta stop it.

597
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:41,133
- I don't think we have much time.
- You're right. We don't have a lot of time.

598
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:45,117
We need to find her body.

599
00:52:47,117 --> 00:52:49,026
Which means
we need to find her tower.

600
00:52:49,149 --> 00:52:53,110
Whoever made this game
knows everything about Elizabeth Bathory.

601
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:56,829
They're the ones who are gonna know
exactly where her plantation really is.

602
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,617
Hey! Swink, what are you doing?

603
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:08,589
It's obvious we have to stay alive
in the game until we end this.

604
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,142
- One of us has to play.
- If you die in the game...

605
00:53:11,373 --> 00:53:13,990
Something won't let us stop playing.
Am I right?

606
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:15,741
If it's gonna play with or without us,
at least I can use myself as a decoy.

607
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:17,383
I can protect us.

608
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:18,492
Let's go.

609
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:38,881
- All right, buddy, you know what to do.
- Stay alive.

610
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:55,532
Game time.

611
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:01,301
<i>This thing is gay.</i>

612
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:14,165
<i>(Abigail) This is where
they made Stay Alive?</i>

613
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:17,785
<i>(Hutch) It seems like
a strange place to make a game.</i>

614
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:23,883
Come on. Let's go.

615
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:48,730
Hello?

616
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:06,794
Hold on.
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

617
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:08,326
Wait here.

618
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:31,633
Oh, my God.

619
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,442
Holy shit.

620
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:55,493
Thank God, man.
Tell me you haven't died in the game.

621
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:57,467
- No, we're fine.
- The place is deserted.

622
00:55:57,577 --> 00:56:01,100
- OK, I need you to get to the back door.
- I'm not really sure where that is.

623
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,365
<i>- What room are you in?
- Some kind of parlor.</i>

624
00:56:03,365 --> 00:56:04,958
All right. Hold on.

625
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:23,259
<i>- (Swink) You're looking at two entries?
- Yeah.</i>

626
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:26,837
<i>Move through the archway.
Not the doorway. Back into the hall.</i>

627
00:56:43,837 --> 00:56:46,301
<i>(Swink) There should be a staircase
to the right and the kitchen to the left.</i>

628
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:48,690
What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?

629
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:54,229
Just pay attention. All right, go through
the kitchen and out the back door.

630
00:56:54,605 --> 00:56:57,729
Just keep walking
until you see the steps with the statues.

631
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:09,071
<i>- (Swink) Do you see the iron gates?
- (Hutch) Uh. Yeah. I see them.</i>

632
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:17,134
<i>(Abigail) Just like the game.</i>

633
00:57:26,805 --> 00:57:30,041
Oh, Jesus Christ.

634
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,835
This is Gerouge Plantation.

635
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:51,219
We're in the bitch's backyard.

636
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:01,814
Elizabeth.

637
00:59:11,196 --> 00:59:14,612
<i>- What does this mean, Hutch?
- It means her body's up in that tower.</i>

638
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,314
No shit.

639
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,465
Elizabeth's diary.

640
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:27,510
All these girls. She killed them all.

641
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:42,693
Abigail's in trouble upstairs.
Which way do I go?

642
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:44,100
Uh...

643
00:59:44,188 --> 00:59:46,910
It's faster to take
the staircase around the side.

644
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:48,310
OK.

645
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:06,661
It's locked! It's locked.
I need a crowbar or something.

646
01:00:09,661 --> 01:00:12,082
<i>(Swink) Do you see one on the step?</i>

647
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:14,764
You gotta be kidding me.

648
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,645
- Which way?
- Right, to the bedroom.

649
01:00:26,645 --> 01:00:28,519
Aw, come on, Swink.

650
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:46,437
<i>- (Hutch) I can't get in. It's locked.
- Wait. Wait. I have a key.</i>

651
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,085
- This is...
- Insane. Now go!

652
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:54,197
Hutch!

653
01:00:57,244 --> 01:01:00,889
- I don't think I'm gonna make it. Help me.
- I know. I see her.

654
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:05,975
<i>Let me try something.</i>

655
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:14,610
It's all right. It's all right.

656
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:19,004
It's OK.
It's all right. It's OK.

657
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:29,117
What happened?
Are you guys all right?

658
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:31,157
Yeah. You saved her life, man.

659
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:34,034
<i>- Goddamn sweet!
- (Hutch) So. What now?</i>

660
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:38,268
We need three nails. And one last thing.
Remember what October said.

661
01:01:38,268 --> 01:01:41,432
The way to cleanse a witch's soul
is to burn her blood.

662
01:01:42,108 --> 01:01:45,741
Wait. The roses. If you're gonna go
up there, you can't forget the wild roses.

663
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:50,555
<i>- You never know, and I bet...</i>

664
01:01:52,057 --> 01:01:53,996
No! No!

665
01:02:09,996 --> 01:02:11,371
Hell, yeah!

666
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,329
Swink!

667
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,402
Come on, you bitch.

668
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,028
Oh, shit.

669
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,965
Bitch, that's cheating!
I'm not dead yet.

670
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,372
<i>(Abigail) Go!</i>

671
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,962
- Swink!
- Swink!

672
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:43,886
<i>- Swink!
- (Swink) Help me!</i>

673
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:05,223
Get away!
Get away from me!

674
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:30,075
Swink!

675
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:39,994
Hutch, I'm sorry.

676
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,581
OK, we're gonna need a hammer.

677
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,064
- Come on.
- Quick!

678
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:18,221
<i>(Abigail) Open the door!</i>

679
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:28,338
Hutch, come on.
Come on! Hutch!

680
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:41,917
Thanks, Swink.

681
01:04:45,053 --> 01:04:47,191
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

682
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,463
It's OK. It's all right.

683
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:51,834
OK?

684
01:05:00,909 --> 01:05:03,291
- I'm gonna go first. Stay right behind me.
- OK.

685
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:23,626
It's OK.

686
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:41,649
- Wait. Did you hear that?

687
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,805
OK. All right. All right, all right.

688
01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:53,398
Come on.

689
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:54,425
This way. This way.

690
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:34,829
There should be a second door in here.

691
01:06:37,764 --> 01:06:40,539
This should be the tower.
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

692
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:53,655
Hutch!

693
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:57,012
<i>- (Hutch) It won't open.
- Oh, no! Open it!</i>

694
01:06:58,172 --> 01:07:00,413
OK. OK, wait, wait, wait. Let me think.
Let me think. I can get this open.

695
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:02,396
- How?
- I don't know. Just give me a second.

696
01:07:02,396 --> 01:07:04,305
- Hutch. Hutch!
- It's just a... What?

697
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:08,419
We don't have the time!

698
01:07:08,572 --> 01:07:10,652
Just think about it.
You gotta finish this.

699
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,380
No.

700
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,039
- Listen.
- I'm not leaving you.

701
01:07:16,572 --> 01:07:18,482
Hutch.

702
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:22,906
I want you to go.

703
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,911
You're our only chance.

704
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:28,434
OK?

705
01:07:30,388 --> 01:07:33,737
- This can't be happening.
- Well, it is.

706
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:49,751
I won't let her take you.

707
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:52,114
I know.

708
01:07:58,396 --> 01:08:00,818
You be careful of that.

709
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:06,871
OK.

710
01:08:52,989 --> 01:08:55,061
He loves me,

711
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:58,448
he loves me not.

712
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,670
He loves me,

713
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,426
he loves me not.

714
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:12,499
He loves me,

715
01:09:14,972 --> 01:09:16,149
he loves me not.

716
01:09:18,396 --> 01:09:20,501
He loves me...

717
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:25,786
Go away!

718
01:09:26,556 --> 01:09:29,109
Go away!

719
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:48,948
No! Go away!

720
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,196
Hutch!

721
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,460
<i>(October) The broken mirrors - why? She
couldn't stand to see herself grow old.</i>

722
01:10:57,971 --> 01:11:01,339
<i>(Phin) It won't break like the others.
I think it's made out of silver or something.</i>

723
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,268
Mom!

724
01:12:13,404 --> 01:12:15,516
- Hutch!
- Come on! Move!

725
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:17,244
Come on, hurry.
Move! Come on, man!

726
01:12:17,244 --> 01:12:18,902
- Move!
- Hutch!

727
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:26,487
<i>(Swink) Come on.
Come on, man! Come on!</i>

728
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,707
Killer.

729
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,710
<i>(group) Come to me. Clouds.</i>

730
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:04,247
<i>May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.</i>

731
01:14:04,476 --> 01:14:06,715
<i>Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist</i>

732
01:14:06,715 --> 01:14:08,887
<i>so they shall harm me not.</i>

733
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:11,633
<i>Let the blood of many cleanse me.</i>

734
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:14,971
<i>Preserving beauty eternal.</i>

735
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:16,580
<i>I pray you.</i>
