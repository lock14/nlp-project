1
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,375
<i>Sometimes I wonder...</i>

2
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,250
<i>how I got to be the way I am.</i>

3
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,583
<i>Most fathers have big dreams
for their little girls.</i>

4
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:10,417
<i>For me, it was to become a concert pianist.</i>

5
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:18,667
<i>But life never turns out the way we expect.</i>

6
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,250
<i>And when we moved to Hong Kong...</i>

7
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>everything changed.</i>

8
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,167
<i>My father was an important businessman.</i>

9
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:56,833
<i>I never knew exactly
what he did for a living...</i>

10
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,083
<i>but we always moved around a lot.</i>

11
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,875
<i>For me, home was always where my family was.</i>

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,958
Ah.

13
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,042
Hi.

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,090
Thank you Liu.

15
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,590
Here it is... your new home.

16
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,780
Chun-Li, don't you know it's rude...

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,890
to sneak up on your elders?

18
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,130
You move quietly... I'm impressed.

19
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:56,292
Would you like to learn to move better?

20
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,375
Huh?

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,417
Ho! Okay.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,292
<i>As the years went by...</i>

23
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,875
<i>a new love brought me closer to my father...</i>

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,250
<i>the art of Wushu.</i>

25
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,833
<i>he was very proud.</i>

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,458
<i>Growing up was like a dream.</i>

27
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:53,042
<i>But nothing lasts forever.</i>

28
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,125
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

29
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,170
May I pour you a glass of Montrachet?

30
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,450
No thank you. I'll see you in the morning.

31
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,208
<i>Balrog.!</i>

32
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>- Papa.! Papa.!
- Chun-Li.!</i>

33
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,083
- Where you going?
- Get off me!

34
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,042
- Let her go.
- Let me go!

35
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,375
I love what you've done to your new place.

36
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,750
<i>Next time you move, tell me...
I'll bring you a housewarming gift.</i>

37
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,000
Papa!

38
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,542
- Let me go! - Well, well, Balrog.
It seems we have a wild one here.

39
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,417
Let her go, Bison.

40
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,210
Go upstairs.

41
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,410
Do as I say!

42
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,958
Shh. It's okay, my sweet.

43
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,708
A gentleman would never harm a schoolgirl.

44
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,000
Go.

45
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,542
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

46
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,375
Night-night.

47
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,167
<i>Balrog.</i>

48
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,083
Chun-Li!

49
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,375
<i>No.!</i>

50
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,708
Hey! You leave her alone!

51
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,333
Get in there!

52
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,510
This was given to me during my travels in India.

53
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,400
They call it the spinning bird.

54
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,920
The bird lacks the prowess to preserve its life.

55
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,990
So when under great duress...

56
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,970
it remains in motion...

57
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,950
so that it may never be caught.

58
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,310
I love you Papa.

59
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,958
Thank you very much.

60
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:26,250
Now I remember why no one wanted to play
with you at Juilliard.

61
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,583
- Aren't you so sweet.
- I'm serious.

62
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:33,000
You always get the flowers.

63
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,000
So how's your mom? Did she come?

64
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,500
<i>- No. She's not doing very well.
- Oh.</i>

65
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,667
I'm so sorry.

66
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,292
Oh! I almost forgot.

67
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,917
- This came for you.
- Who's it from?

68
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,042
I don't know. An admirer maybe?

69
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,667
I wonder what it says.

70
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,667
Wow!

71
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,542
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

72
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,167
<i>So, after the concert,
I finally gave him my phone number.</i>

73
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,333
I don't know if he'll call but...

74
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,750
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- I'm okay. I like taking the subway.

75
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,458
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay.

76
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,750
Are you alright?

78
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,270
Is anyone going to help this man?

79
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm glad you're home.

80
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:07,110
Thank you.

81
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,833
<i>The crime rate continues to rise...</i>

82
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,833
<i>in several slum districts
throughout Southeast Asia.</i>

83
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:19,917
<i>No single group has been identified
for this new wave of violence.</i>

84
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,917
<i>Authorities instead suggest an overlap...</i>

85
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,292
Chun-Li?

86
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,500
Why did you take off your concert dress?

87
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,042
I couldn't wear it all the way home.

88
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,708
<i>I wanted to see you in it.</i>

89
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,083
And I'll bet you took the subway again, huh?

90
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,042
<i>It's dangerous out there, sweetie.</i>

91
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,500
Mama...

92
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,542
we can't just change our lives...

93
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,167
every time the news tells us so.

94
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,250
<i>Just like your father.</i>

95
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,125
Always standing up when standing's not easy.

96
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,708
<i>Gentlemen, thank you for coming.</i>

97
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,542
<i>As the distinguished leaders
of the Shadaloo Investment Corporation...</i>

98
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,542
you're all very important men.

99
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,792
And I don't mean to waste your time.

100
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,583
So, a toast.

101
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,875
Over the years our networks
have been very useful for each other.

102
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,833
We've all been well compensated for it.

103
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:43,042
Unfortunately for you,
that compensation is about to come to an end.

104
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:47,083
<i>I'm taking over Shadaloo
and moving my interests...</i>

105
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,125
into Bangkok.

106
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,917
Now, I understand that many of these
territories overlap with neighborhoods...

107
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,583
that, at this moment,
you consider to be your own.

108
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,500
This is no longer true.

109
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,292
The sooner you accept this,
the better it'll be.

110
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:03,590
This guy's nuts.

111
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:05,690
We should kill him right now.

112
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,560
Let me finish.

113
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,042
<i>Show your loyalty to me right now...</i>

114
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,000
and we'll have no problems.

115
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,042
Slainte.

116
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,020
I would watch my words if I were you.

117
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,270
Don't worry about my words.

118
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,390
This conversation is over.

119
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,708
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

120
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,375
- Nobody talks to me like that.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

121
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,375
That pig.

122
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,625
Mmm. Mmm-mm.

123
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,958
This just came in.

124
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,180
You need to see this.

125
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,430
Someone wanted to make a statement.

126
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,542
Gangland homicide?

127
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,450
You're looking at her.

128
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,833
<i>I love this job.</i>

129
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,042
You're the Interpol man?

130
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,542
Yeah. Call me Nash.

131
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,667
Maya Sunee, Bangkok G.H.

132
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,875
New Year's come early?

133
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,208
We got a tip at 6:00 this morning.
Someone wanted us to know this was here.

134
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,250
heads of every crime family.

135
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,750
<i>Signed, sealed and delivered.</i>

136
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,750
<i>Yeah, Last Supper.</i>

137
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,875
And he serves 'em their own heads.

138
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,958
"He"?

139
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,917
Tell me something I don't know, Nash.

140
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,792
You just inherited a big problem.

141
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,917
Good morning.

142
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,292
Or is it evening?

143
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,500
She had a piano concert.

144
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,167
From what I've heard,
she was quite well received.

145
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,042
You know, I'm surprised you chose
the landscape setting.

146
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:18,083
<i>I'd have thought of you
as being much more of a big city man.</i>

147
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,750
A prison is a prison, Bison.

148
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,917
No matter what's outside.

149
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,583
Show a prisoner the world, and all he sees...

150
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,208
are the bars on the window.

151
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,625
You needn't be so cynical.

152
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,167
<i>Ahhh. Home, sweet home.</i>

153
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,875
- Gorgeous, isn't it?
- So how'd your meeting go?

154
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,583
Very well. Thank you for asking.

155
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm officially the only surviving
partner of Shadaloo.

156
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,167
Now we move on to
the Bangkok board of directors.

157
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,750
I'll need their contacts for that.

158
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:04,417
Killing them isn't gonna
get you anywhere, Bison.

159
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,833
I'm not interested in the board.

160
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,750
I'm interested in their families.

161
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,750
Damn you!

162
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:28,792
Get him more pictures of the girl,
something more upbeat this time.

163
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:33,208
It's amazing what a man will do
just to see his daughter.

164
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,708
There's one thing I learned in the slums...

165
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,625
When people are hungry,
there's nothing they won't do.

166
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,333
Everyone has a price.

167
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,458
<i>With my mother gone,
the path in front of me was empty.</i>

168
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,625
<i>I couldn't help feeling
like I was being led somewhere new.</i>

169
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,208
<i>Was this mysterious scroll a message?</i>

170
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,542
<i>Who was it from?</i>

171
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,542
<i>I had to find out.</i>

172
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,100
If what you look for is shelter, you have come to the wrong place.

173
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.

174
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,000
You have something for me?

175
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,350
How did you know that?

176
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,280
This is ancient Chinese.

177
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,750
This is not a letter, it is a light...

178
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,560
shining only upon you.

179
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,520
Go to Bangkok...

180
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:23,520
Find Gen to find out what you are missing.

181
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,020
I don't understand.

182
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:30,130
In life, there is beauty and terror all around us.

183
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,670
One must not overwhelm the other.

184
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,490
To embrace both, you'll need the strength of a warrior,

185
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,970
the stealth of a predator and the wisdom of a Master.

186
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,500
Gen can help you.

187
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:45,600
Who is Gen?

188
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,330
He was once a feared criminal.

189
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,090
Now, he is a guardian of those he hurt.

190
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,840
He leads the Order of the Web.

191
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,700
How can I find him?

192
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,050
He will choose when you find him.

193
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,130
Perhaps he is closer than you thought.

194
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,690
You must go to Bangkok.

195
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,875
Crashing our party?

196
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,458
Get used to it.
We're your new roommates.

197
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,458
<i>Who says we need any?</i>

198
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,625
<i>I've spent the last three years of my life...</i>

199
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,458
chasin' around an organization
called Shadaloo.

200
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:47,708
- Shadaloo's a myth.
- I wouldn't be in this ashtray if it was.

201
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,333
Those bodies piled up in the harbor...

202
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,792
they were the heads of the ruling
crime families of Bangkok, correct?

203
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,417
<i>- Yes.
- Uh-huh. Right?</i>

204
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,917
And now they're all dead except for one.

205
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,917
His name's Bison...

206
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:07,375
and I've tracked him through 11 major cities
on four continents and never come close.

207
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,417
Not once.

208
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
This guy walks through the raindrops.

209
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:17,375
And anybody that's against him
is either dead or on their way.

210
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,708
Now he's the last man standing.

211
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,708
So, where do we start?

212
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,083
You don't want a ticket
to this dance, Detective.

213
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,375
You've never even seen me dance.

214
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,000
<i>To find Gen...</i>

215
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:48,250
<i>I was told I had to leave behind
the life I knew...</i>

216
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,250
<i>even my home...</i>

217
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,500
<i>and all the memories that were so dear to me.</i>

218
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,450
Thank you.

219
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,430
We're going to miss you.

220
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
I'll be back.

221
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,417
<i>As it was written in the scroll...</i>

222
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,417
<i>I had to forget everything I used to be.</i>

223
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,333
<i>I had to lose myself
to the pulse of the streets.</i>

224
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,708
<i>I had to become one
with the people of Bangkok.</i>

225
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,708
<i>This was all so new to me.</i>

226
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,208
<i>Life was hard on these streets.</i>

227
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:07,625
<i>Every night was a struggle.</i>

228
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>Every meal was a gift.</i>

229
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,500
<i>Day after day, I searched for Gen.</i>

230
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:40,292
<i>As time went by,
I was getting further and further away...</i>

231
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,542
<i>from all that I ever was.</i>

232
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,833
<i>I felt lost...</i>

233
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,583
<i>chasing a ghost I might never find.</i>

234
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,958
<i>But what I found...</i>

235
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,625
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

236
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,708
<i>Everywhere I looked...</i>

237
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,833
<i>there was crime without punishment.</i>

238
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,125
<i>I wanted to do something.</i>

239
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,542
<i>Anything.</i>

240
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,750
<i>I just didn't know where to begin.</i>

241
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,333
<i>Who could protect these people?</i>

242
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,750
<i>Who was oppressing them?</i>

243
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,167
Fantastic, isn't it?

244
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,708
All these waterfront slums
will soon belong to Shadaloo.

245
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,750
Location, location, location.

246
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,708
This came in from Murmansk.
I think you're gonna like it.

247
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,542
<i>It's the White Rose.</i>

248
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,125
How long has it been? Fifteen years?

249
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,792
Seventeen years...

250
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,792
four months and six days.

251
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,500
Bring the package to Bangkok... safely.

252
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,792
There is no room for error.

253
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,333
I got some bad news too.

254
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:41,167
The schoolgirl's gone.

255
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,542
<i>We think she's in Bangkok.
But don't worry. We'll find her.</i>

256
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,792
Hey!

257
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,708
Hey!

258
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,875
Leave him alone.

259
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,625
It's none of your business, baby.

260
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:30,000
Where you go, trouble follows.

261
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,042
My name is Gen. Don't worry, Chun-Li.

262
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:43,042
- How do you know who I am?
- We've been watching you for some time.

263
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,750
I know who took your father.

264
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:49,125
He's alive? Where is he?

265
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,708
<i>- I'll tell you when you're ready.
- Ready for what?</i>

266
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,083
<i>Ready to put away your anger.</i>

267
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,750
<i>You are the only one who can bring
your father back, and I can help you do it.</i>

268
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,667
But you have to do it my way.

269
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,750
Just tell me where he is.

270
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,500
You don't know what you're up against.

271
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,500
Let me show you.

272
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,083
<i>These are the slums.</i>

273
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,125
<i>The people are suffering.</i>

274
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,625
<i>The streets are being taken over
by a criminal organization...</i>

275
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,625
called Shadaloo.

276
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,042
I used to be a part of 'em.

277
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:31,333
When you fight on the side of monsters,
eventually you become one yourself.

278
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,917
That's why I changed, saw the better way.

279
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,417
The Order of the Web.

280
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:43,167
I created the Order to fight injustice...

281
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,792
<i>to protect the people
who can't fight for themselves.</i>

282
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,833
- What does this have to do with my father?
- Everything.

283
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,458
Your father was a very
well-connected businessman.

284
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,917
His relationships could open any doors
in any country anywhere.

285
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,542
Many people wanted those connections.

286
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,333
People like Bison, the leader of Shadaloo.

287
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,625
My father would never help someone like that.

288
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,708
No? Not even for the safety
of his only daughter?

289
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:15,250
- What do you want from me?
- I'm giving you a chance to join us...

290
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:18,500
to become part of the Web, to fight
for something far greater than yourself.

291
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,583
I already know how to fight.

292
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,500
Impress me.

293
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,125
Anger isn't gonna guide you.

294
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,958
Trust me. I know.

295
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,917
- Why are you mad right now?
- Because you're hurting me.

296
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,875
No. You're hurting yourself.

297
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,083
You fight with passion...

298
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,875
but your anger distorts your judgment.

299
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:28,833
Bison will see right through you.

300
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,208
<i>Believe in your true self.</i>

301
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,667
Look for an innocence beyond the anger.

302
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You still got a long way to go.

303
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,375
<i>Bison, the same man who took my father...</i>

304
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,458
<i>was here in Bangkok.</i>

305
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>I'd never been so close...</i>

306
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,875
<i>and so far away.</i>

307
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,125
<i>I had to research his organization.</i>

308
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,708
<i>I had to find out about Shadaloo.</i>

309
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,625
<i>I must congratulate you all, gentlemen.</i>

310
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:15,292
You've shown remarkably sound judgment.

311
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,625
Not many municipal governments
would take such a bold stand...

312
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,708
against the criminal elements
of their own population.

313
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:26,167
People will point to you
long after your time has passed.

314
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,042
<i>And here's the best part...
your debts are now clean.</i>

315
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,500
<i>What about our families?</i>

316
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,792
Your children have been returned.

317
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,167
Mr. Bison thanks you
for your continuing support.

318
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,100
Local authorities refused to comment on this controversial decision.

319
00:35:55,101 --> 00:36:00,300
However, one source confirmed the waterfront slums of Bangkok...

320
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:04,140
will be handed over to Esperanto Corporation within hours.

321
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,792
The papers are signed.
The slums are in your hands.

322
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:13,083
Good girl, Cantana.
I'll handle the Secretary of Commerce.

323
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,750
Looks like somebody's about to own
the Ministry of Commerce.

324
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,625
<i>Nash, I have a source at the port authority.</i>

325
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:24,000
He said the state just sold the majority share
of the slums to Esperanto Security Company.

326
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,292
<i>Everything from the harbor to the markets.</i>

327
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,958
Of course. It's a front for Shadaloo.

328
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:33,583
<i>Bison's bringing crime into the neighborhoods
to drive the land value down.</i>

329
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:36,875
And then he's buying it back up wholesale.

330
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,417
- We gotta move on then.
- Okay, we're on it. Come with me.

331
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:44,042
Isn't this your old neighborhood?

332
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,333
Old and new.

333
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,917
Home, sweet home.

334
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,458
I'm such a sentimental guy
that I invested in this shit hole.

335
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:54,125
Though I have to admit,
I got a very nice deal on it.

336
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,167
It doesn't look like a nice deal for them.

337
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,292
<i>And I think they want it back.</i>

338
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,292
Too late for that.

339
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,500
Bulldozers come in tomorrow.
And soon after...

340
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:06,458
beautiful homes for those who can afford it.

341
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,458
I'm making Bangkok a better place.

342
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:12,083
- They should build me a temple for that.
- Mmm.

343
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,625
<i>Life's about choices, Balrog.</i>

344
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,750
<i>I was about his age when I made mine.</i>

345
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,125
<i>And I've never looked back.</i>

346
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,042
<i>Hey, Maya?
I love stakeouts as much as the next guy...</i>

347
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:47,042
<i>but what the hell are we doing here?</i>

348
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:49,083
<i>Well, our source says Bison's guy...</i>

349
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,292
<i>should be leaving
for the meet any second now.</i>

350
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,458
Are you sure we're in the right place?

351
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,458
No, I just like the view.

352
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,375
Wait. There he is.

353
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,125
Come here.

354
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,292
- That had to be done.
- Yeah, it had to.

355
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:47,792
<i>There goes the Benz.</i>

356
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,208
<i>Just make sure you don't lose him, Romeo.</i>

357
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,208
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

358
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,667
Why are we meeting here? We handed over
the slums. What more do you want?

359
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:02,750
There's a package coming in
on a ship from Murmansk.

360
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,042
We need safe passage and no damn customs.

361
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,417
You're the commerce secretary.

362
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,375
So make it happen.

363
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
- I need details.
- It's on the shipping manifest.

364
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,625
<i>The package is called the White Rose.</i>

365
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:29,167
Only in the dark do all colors become one.

366
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:32,333
You can't just cope with the darkness...

367
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,917
You have to embrace what is without fear.

368
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,583
You have to feel without your senses.

369
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:42,625
Harness the energy around you.

370
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,125
Well done. Let's eat.

371
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,417
<i>Yo, Maya. You almost done in there?</i>

372
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,917
<i>Hey, it's not my fault you got here early.</i>

373
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,042
So we're going clubbing tonight.

374
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:07,125
Bison's attache loves
hittin' the nightlife...

375
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,750
and I want to see what she's up to.

376
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,375
Always work with you.

377
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,667
You know, Nash,
if what you say about Bison is true...

378
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,375
waiting and watching his bitch
is not gonna be the way we bring him down.

379
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,000
We should be more aggressive.

380
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,042
Looks like you got that down.

381
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:32,208
Well, unlike you, I don't lose my man.

382
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:36,292
And besides,
there's nothing I won't try once.

383
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,083
Do you have any cash? I'm thirsty.

384
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:58,667
- Are you serious?
- I don't have any money.

385
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,708
You should try hocking those gold handcuffs.

386
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,850
They are here.

387
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,090
Are they in? I can't see them.

388
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:38,000
To the boys who have got my back.

389
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,083
Tonight, I've got my own. Enjoy.

390
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,292
Thought I might ask you a few questions.

391
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,417
<i>Tell me about the White Rose.</i>

392
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,375
You must be Daddy's little girl.

393
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,417
Out of order, ladies.

394
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,500
- Cantana.
- I know who your boss is.

395
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:27,333
- Tell me.
- It's a shipment.

396
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,583
Arrives at the end of the month...
the last Friday.

397
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,833
<i>- Where?
- Central Shipyard, Berth 21.</i>

398
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,250
<i>I want you to send Bison a message.</i>

399
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:42,792
Tell him the schoolgirl's grown up.

400
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,917
<i>This is it.</i>

401
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,375
Nash... Nash, something's going down.

402
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,792
<i>Hey.!</i>

403
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:43,042
<i>Interpol.! Freeze.! Stay down.</i>

404
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:13,708
Are you gonna tell me, or should I guess?

405
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:15,750
Go ahead and guess.

406
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:47,083
That is one tough cookie.

407
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:49,750
She most certainly was.

408
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,292
But she'd said enough.

409
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,458
The damage was done.

410
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:58,500
You think we gotta change the plans?

411
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:04,792
Unfortunately, we do.
Get the insurance policy.

412
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,875
Call Vega.

413
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,000
<i>- I don't know. Maybe she's an angry stripper.
- Yeah.</i>

414
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:18,167
An irate pole dancer
not happy with her tips...

415
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,208
sets off Armageddon.

416
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:25,250
<i>- Keep spitballing that, Maya.
I love where your head's at. - All right, Nash.</i>

417
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,250
What do you think it is?

418
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:32,083
This girl just wiped the floor with some
of the most dangerous players in Bangkok...

419
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,333
and then bails out like
she's got a plane to catch.

420
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:39,000
She's making a statement.
Now, come on, fellas. Who is this girl?

421
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:43,125
Does she have priors?
A paper trail? How about a name?

422
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,208
We checked the archives.
Nash, she's off the radar.

423
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,417
We can look at
the closed-circuit security feed.

424
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,958
The front door has a good shot.

425
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,875
Hey, thanks.

426
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,140
Have you seen this woman?

427
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,190
Have you seen this woman?

428
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,430
Have you seen this woman?

429
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,750
Mmm-mm.

430
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,625
How's aggressive workin' for ya?

431
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,125
Shut up.

432
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:33,583
<i>- No one's talking.
- No, they won't.</i>

433
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:36,167
They're protecting her.

434
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,083
You're right.

435
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:56,083
- Home-cooked.
- Tell me about Bison.

436
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:03,833
We grew up together.
Like me, he was a criminal...

437
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,000
with no future.

438
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,000
His parents were Irish missionaries...

439
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,167
who died in Thailand when he was very young.

440
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,833
<i>Soon, the boy became very ill.</i>

441
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:20,375
<i>Where he was, no one cared about the sick.</i>

442
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,750
<i>So they left him... to die.</i>

443
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,083
<i>But the child survived.</i>

444
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,833
<i>With each passing year...</i>

445
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:35,208
<i>he became more and more feared...</i>

446
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:38,000
<i>and a well-known thief on the streets.</i>

447
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:42,875
<i>He took what he wanted when he wanted it.</i>

448
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,042
<i>But even that wasn't enough.</i>

449
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,958
<i>He yearned for more.</i>

450
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:57,708
<i>So he went to the dark caves
in the Phang Nga Bay...</i>

451
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:00,542
<i>and brought his new wife.</i>

452
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,500
<i>From ancient tales...</i>

453
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,375
<i>he'd heard about the Dark Forces...</i>

454
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,458
<i>that could free a man from his conscience.</i>

455
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:45,750
<i>He had to transfer
the goodness of his soul...</i>

456
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:48,583
<i>into his unborn daughter.</i>

457
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,000
<i>The transformation was complete.</i>

458
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,250
<i>He had finally rid himself of his conscience.</i>

459
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,750
Now he's home again...

460
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:27,000
Bangkok, where it all started.

461
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:30,417
He's making moves on a bigger scale
than I've ever seen before.

462
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:33,708
Sounds like the perfect time
to take him down and bring my father back.

463
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,125
How's your wrist?

464
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,458
- It's better.
- Good.

465
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,875
You're doing well.

466
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,208
Chun-Li.

467
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,250
I've got an important task for you.

468
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,167
Maybe the hardest thing
I'll ever ask you to do.

469
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,167
I want you to go buy groceries for breakfast.

470
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,208
Pawning off all the hard work?

471
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:00,417
That's the privilege of a teacher.

472
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,625
<i>Get the R.P.G.</i>

473
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,417
Fire the missile!

474
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,708
But our men are in there.

475
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:52,917
Give me that! I'll do it myself.

476
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:05,500
Say good night, baby.

477
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:14,708
Let's go.

478
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,250
<i>I called you because
you do my best dirty work.</i>

479
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:05,125
Something very important
to me is about to arrive in Bangkok.

480
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,208
And I don't want anything to
interfere with it.

481
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,458
There is a schoolgirl
that needs taking care of.

482
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:16,333
<i>What kind of schoolgirl are we talking about?</i>

483
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,542
She is a problem child.

484
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,750
Well, well, well.

485
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,708
She'll never be a problem again.

486
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,292
<i>You've got ghosts. Let's see 'em.</i>

487
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,792
Chun-Li.

488
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:11,750
Huh?

489
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:54,333
No wonder you wear a mask.

490
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:57,083
I'd hide that face too.

491
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,417
You bitch!

492
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
I'll cut you open!

493
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:12,208
You think this is over?

494
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,250
No. I'm just getting started.

495
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,458
This is a restricted area.

496
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:40,917
I thought you might make an exception.

497
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,500
I have a question for you.

498
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:51,458
A shipment was scheduled
to arrive at Berth 21 in two days.

499
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:56,333
Listen, lady,
I think it's time for you to go.

500
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:03,458
<i>They call it Bai Mei... the White Rose.</i>

501
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,250
What time does it arrive?

502
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,083
Midnight.

503
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,625
You should learn some manners.

504
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,042
Never put your hands on a lady.

505
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,875
Forget to pay the rent? Where is everybody?

506
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,042
Orders from up high. We're off the case.

507
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,042
What orders?

508
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,458
Orders, Nash.

509
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,500
You were right.

510
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,500
Shadaloo is very well connected.

511
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:44,667
- We're out.
- Hey, wait a minute. Maya.

512
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,917
That's it?

513
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:51,083
I'm sorry, Charlie.

514
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:13,333
You're not a schoolgirl anymore.

515
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,208
Bring her in.

516
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,708
<i>Oh.</i>

517
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,958
So this is the girl that roughed up Vega?

518
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,667
<i>I like her already.</i>

519
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,875
Huang!

520
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,083
Let me go!

521
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,292
<i>Papa.</i>

522
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,458
<i>You two take some time and catch up.</i>

523
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,417
Chun-Li.

524
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Why?

525
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,958
Papa, I had to.

526
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,292
You know I tried so hard for so many years...

527
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:29,417
just to keep you safe...

528
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,333
to protect you...

529
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,333
to make sure you had the good life.

530
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,958
I would rather have you.

531
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:43,458
Getting in Bison's way, it's a losing battle.

532
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:46,125
Why are you doing this to yourself?

533
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,708
Sometimes, you have to stand up...

534
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,792
when standing isn't easy.

535
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:54,708
- You taught me that.
- I love you so much.

536
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,875
I love you.

537
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:09,750
I love family reunions.

538
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,875
Don't touch her.

539
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:16,333
If you touch her again,
you get nothing more from me.

540
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:20,167
- Do you understand?
- Oh, I understand.

541
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:23,833
You see,
your father has been the milk of my business.

542
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,542
But even milk...

543
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,708
has an expiration date.

544
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,958
- No. No, don't.
- I'm a man of my word.

545
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:39,458
- No, please! 
- I promised him he'd have a chance to say good-bye.

546
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:43,208
<i>No! No! No, please, stop!</i>

547
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:45,708
No!

548
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:57,583
You... will not stop me.

549
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:08,042
<i>Take the body away.</i>

550
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,083
Balrog.

551
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,083
Is there anything you wanna say before
we get this over with?

552
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,958
<i>All right.</i>

553
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,833
And make it quick.

554
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,667
Should we kill you
before or after we cut you?

555
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:45,583
I wouldn't do either.

556
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:47,917
- You're not in a place to negotiate.
- Not yet.

557
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,542
Swing around the block.

558
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,625
Ow!

559
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,625
<i>Somebody got a problem?</i>

560
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:59,417
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

561
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,917
You're alive.

562
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,958
Come on.

563
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,875
<i>Gen.</i>

564
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,917
Where you go...

565
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,417
trouble certainly does follow.

566
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,708
Let me see this.

567
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,958
Hmm. Let's fix it.

568
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,292
Come.

569
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:30,208
Pretty soon,
You're not gonna need me anymore.

570
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,750
<i>Now, let's find the White Rose.</i>

571
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,917
How's your arm doing?

572
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:49,167
I'm sorry. They made me do it.

573
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:52,208
Do you remember my question,
or do I have to ask you again?

574
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:56,917
Tomorrow night, a ship from Murmansk...

575
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:59,042
will arrive in the front berth.

576
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:01,208
You wouldn't set me up twice now, would you?

577
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:04,042
Please. Look.

578
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,125
It's right here. See?

579
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,625
Thank you.

580
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:41,917
<i>Sorry for interrupting.</i>

581
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:44,083
<i>No problem.</i>

582
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,750
Hi.

583
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:49,792
What can I do for ya?

584
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,875
Bison's shipment arrives
at Central harbor tomorrow night.

585
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,125
And?

586
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,167
I'm gonna need backup.

587
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,667
<i>Unit three's holding. Got it.</i>

588
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,500
<i>Check the ammo.</i>

589
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,542
Good. We're good to go.

590
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:13,542
<i>All right, Bison, where the hell are you?</i>

591
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:20,042
- We've got guests, fellas.
- We're set.

592
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,150
Alpha team, stay with me.

593
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:36,420
Sergeant, secure the perimeter.

594
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,458
I thought you were out.

595
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:48,417
We all grew up in this neighborhood.

596
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:51,167
Don't wanna see it disappear.

597
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,708
<i>Looks like they're expecting us.</i>

598
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,875
We are not alone.

599
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,917
It makes no difference. We're ready.

600
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:32,208
Bomb! Everybody out! Go! Go!

601
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,958
Go! Go! Go!

602
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,833
Nash!

603
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,625
- Stay low!
- Come on! Come on!

604
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:29,792
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

605
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:15,000
Are you okay?

606
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,930
I don't understand. Where's my father?

607
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:20,000
Okay. Just stay here.

608
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:46,125
You know,
You're a lot slower than you used to be.

609
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,542
And you're just as ugly as I remember!

610
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,000
<i>Where's the White Rose?</i>

611
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:38,750
<i>You don't even know what the White Rose is!</i>

612
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:41,625
By the time you fools figure it out,
she'll be long gone.

613
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,042
"She"?

614
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,958
You two stay with her! You, come with me!

615
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:23,625
<i>That's Bison.</i>

616
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,167
Give me a fix on the helicopter
leaving my location.

617
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,042
Nash, out.

618
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,708
<i>Gen.!</i>

619
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:56,250
<i>The White Rose...
not a weapon. A girl.</i>

620
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:59,792
A girl? I just saw her.

621
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,292
Bison's daughter was
the conduit for his soul.

622
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,542
<i>- He rid himself of his goodness
by passing it into her.</i>

623
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:10,542
<i>And she is his only weakness.</i>

624
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,292
That's why he's been
looking for her all this time.

625
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,000
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

626
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,250
And I'm gonna need support when we get there!

627
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:21,208
Don't keep me waiting! Nash, out!

628
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,708
We got him on radar! We gotta move now!

629
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:27,042
- Bison's got a girl with him.
- What girl?

630
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:29,583
<i>- His daughter. her name's Rose.
- Let's get her.</i>

631
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,833
Okay.

632
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:33,958
Move!

633
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,060
My sweet girl.

634
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,060
You're as beautiful as your mother.

635
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,400
I loved her very much,

636
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,850
even to this day.

637
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:06,680
I still wear the ring she gave me.

638
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,875
Ah.

639
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,690
We're finally together.

640
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,560
I built this empire for you.

641
01:20:23,561 --> 01:20:26,770
Papa will protect you. Nothing will happen to you now.

642
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,958
Still no word from Balrog.

643
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,500
If anything happens to her...

644
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,833
I'll kill you first.

645
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,292
Where's the girl?

646
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,542
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

647
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,250
You should never have left the team.

648
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,417
We wouldn't be standing here like this.

649
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:54,042
But, of course,
only one of us is standing.

650
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,292
Nice try.

651
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,708
<i>Seven-six-seven-five.</i>

652
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,625
<i>You must be Rose.</i>

653
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,708
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

654
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,583
<i>Where is she?</i>

655
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,083
It's time we said good-bye,
old friend.

656
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,292
Fathers always have a soft spot
for their daughters.

657
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:26,708
That's how I brought yours down.

658
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:30,500
<i>You didn't think this was
going to end well, now, did you?</i>

659
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,542
<i>Chun-Li.!</i>

660
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:43,542
You know what you need to do.

661
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:43,792
Fathers always have a weakness
for their daughters.

662
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:49,708
Chun-Li.

663
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:56,083
Nice work.

664
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:03,167
Hey, you'd better get out of here.

665
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:06,292
Chopper's on the other side of the island.

666
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:09,125
I never saw you.

667
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:14,375
See to it she gets a real life.

668
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,458
You too, huh?

669
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,500
Thanks, Nash.

670
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:35,958
Charlie Nash, Interpol! hold your fire!

671
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,083
Hey.

672
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,125
Hey.

673
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:50,750
- You're back in business, huh?
- Yep.

674
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,917
Are you sure you wanna go back
to Gangland homicide?

675
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,958
- It's what I do.
- It's your first time?

676
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,250
Nah. I've been there before.

677
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,250
I can imagine.

678
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,792
If you get lonely at night, don't call me.

679
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:22,833
I love this job.

680
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:34,542
<i>I don't think
this was the life my father envisioned for me.</i>

681
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:36,917
<i>But... maybe it was.</i>

682
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,833
<i>I know he would have been proud.</i>

683
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:49,583
<i>I've stood when standing was not easy...</i>

684
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:52,792
<i>and have found something to believe in.</i>

685
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,833
<i>Something worth fighting for.</i>

686
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:01,292
<i>The Order of the Web.</i>

687
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,792
Gen!

688
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,750
There's more work to be done.

689
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:32,625
Something about this smells of an old friend.

690
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:39,958
- But Bison's dead.
- We need to recruit.

691
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,000
<i>They've been talking about
a fighter in Japan...</i>

692
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:44,333
<i>Ryu... something.</i>

693
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:47,333
<i>I hear he's a force to be reckoned with.</i>

694
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:49,125
Wanna come?

695
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,792
Maybe next time.

696
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,833
Does this mean you're done fighting?

697
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,333
No. For now, I'm home.

698
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,583
<i>Ace... hood.!</i>

699
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:51,500
<i>hood.! Brother.!</i>

700
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:54,500
<i>Look at that! Shit. Hey.</i>

701
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,583
<i>Yeah.</i>
