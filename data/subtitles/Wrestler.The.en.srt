What's the matter?
Did they raise the price of tights?

Funny.

Hey. Tommy. We're gonna

118
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,293
<i>I know you, Tommy. I saw you out in, uh,
Pennsylvania a couple months ago.</i>

119
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,422

<i>You know, people
who drive the Cadillacs...</i>

122
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,538
the ones with the politics...
they run the show.

123
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,734
- It ain't about ability, so you just hang in there.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

124
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,106
- All right.
- But, uh, as far as tonight...

125
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,145
I don't know what you wanna do.

126
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,239
I had a few ideas. I was thinking,
you know, maybe just for the heat...

127
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,945
- I would give you a low blow,
follow it up with a bulldog.
- Just bring the cheap heat, bro.

128
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,181
- You guys should get the heat on us right away.
- <i>All right.</i>

129
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,225
Keep the heat on us, beat the shit
out of us. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

130
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,259
We'll come up,
we'll get on the ropes.

131
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,385
- You guys bring us both in the hard way.
- Okay.

132
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,296
Then we get up, double dropkick,
we powder out again.

133
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,299
All right.
So we're gonna really milk it tonight.

134
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,562
- We're gonna milk it.
Nice and slow, old-school, easy.
- Old-school.

135
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,230
Don't work his leg, man.
That's - Everybody does that.

136
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,774
- Work his neck. Work his neck.
- <i>No, no. We working the neck.</i>

137
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,809
- You're working the neck?
- <i>I already got the leg.</i>

138
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,471
- All right. You guys got the leg?
- Leg or neck. What you got?

139
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,379
- Maybe make your comeback right off there.
- Bang off the ropes...

140
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,077
<i>then super kick and, uh, Ram Jam...</i>

141
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,086
and we go have a beer, okay?

142
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:05,089
- That sounds great, man.
- You hang in there. You got a lot of ability.

143
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,590
- All right. All right.
- Okay?

144
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:07,648

00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:07,268
<i>I'm coming out there, and I'll beat the
hell out of each and every one of you!</i>

168
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,671
<i>You know who you're dealing with?
I will destroy you people!</i>

169
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:18,274
<i>Shut the hell up!
That's it, old man!</i>

170
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,513
<i>Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!</i>

171
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,577
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

172
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,663
Yeah.

173
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,982
Huh?

174
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,221
Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,152
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here is your winner...</i>

182
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:38,491
<i>Randy "The Ram" Robinson!</i>

183
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,341
Ram, you really popped that crowd.

184
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,943
- I'm just gonna glue this up, okay?
- Yep.

185
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,003
<i>Yo, Ram, you got a sec?</i>

186
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,014
Come on in.

187
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,607
You realize what's coming up?

188
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,519
- Huh?
- April 6.

189
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,615
Twentieth anniversary
of you and Ayatollah at the Garden.

190
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,354
- I know. Hey. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,623
- Long time ago.
- Time fucking flies, right?

192
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,688
Here's what I'm thinkin'

193
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,791
Two words: Re... match.

194
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,859
Okay, Ram.
You're all set.

195
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:22,236
We're doing this big Fanfest thing down in
Wilmington with Ring of Honor that weekend.

196
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,640
I wanna main event it
with you two guys.

197
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,645
"Ram, Ayatollah II."

198
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:31,979
Hey. I heard Bob was doing really good
with his used car lot out in Arizona.

199
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,780
- I don't know if he's gonna... You know.
- Come on. For this?

200
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,116
Bob's gonna dust off the old turban.

201
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,248
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,622
- Hey, bring it.
- Okay.

203
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,964
Hey.

204
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,330
- That's for Ram!
- Ram!

205
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,565
- Good stuff. Good stuff.
- <i>Good stuff. Just like the old days.</i>

206
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:58,035
Come on, guys.
Let's all go take a shower together.

207
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,310
What's up, Ram?
How you doing?

208
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,539
- What's up, Big Chris? What's shaking?
- I'm all right.

209
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,380
Yo, baby, you still got that hookup with
that quack at your gym? The juice head?

210
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,420
- What do you need?
- Yo, my back is killing me.

211
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,421
Vicodin, Perc, Nubain,
whatever he's got.

212
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:15,517
- Come by the mansion in a couple of days,
I'll hook you up.
- You the man, Ram. You the man.

213
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,433
<i>Grab some. Yeah.</i>

214
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,807
- Hey, Ruby. How you doing, baby?
- Hey, Ram. How's it goin'

215
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:36,040
- I'll take a cold one.
- All right.

216
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,843
There you go.

217
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,082
- Cassidy around?
- I think she's working the V.I.P.

218
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,719
Yeah, thank you.

219
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,380
<i>♪ I got a question, if
you can answer this ♪</i>

220
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,077
<i>♪ I got a question ♪</i>

221
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,211

222
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,756
<i>I'm sorry, sweetie.
We said the other girl.</i>

223
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,587
<i>Yeah, the blonde girl with the
belly chain. Yeah, the other girl.</i>

224
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,993
- Well, yeah, but she's on break.
- <i>I'm sorry, but we really don't want you.</i>

225
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,032
- How old are you anyway?
- Oh, you're like my mom's age.

226
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,365
<i>Hey.
There's nothing like experience.</i>

227
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,869
<i>I do things your fiancée's
never even dreamed of doing.</i>

228
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,430
Yeah, like graduate in 1985!

229
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,800
Hey, hey. You girls are being
a little rude to the lady.

230
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,869
- How about an apology?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

231
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,608
Don't talk to the lady like that.

232
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:47,277
- I'll talk to her like I wanna talk to her.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

233
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,912
- You don't need to be talking to her like that.
- It's cool. I got it.

234
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,445
- I got it. It's all right, guys.
- No. Let me tell you something.

235
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,256
I guarantee you,
this lady's a hundred times hotter...

236
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,455
than any skank-ass pussy
you're gonna be marrying.

237
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,692
- What the fuck? That's my fucking sister.
- What you say?

238
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,428
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

239
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,935
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

240
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:08,063
- Fucker.
- See you soon.

241
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,041
200 fuckin' bucks walked out.

242
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,042
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

243
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,909
<i>Oh, come on.
They were punks.</i>

244
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,074
- You!
- <i>Hey. Whoa. Easy there.</i>

245
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,708
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,948
<i>I'm better-looking
than them anyway.</i>

247
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,454
<i>I didn't mean to piss you off.
Come on.</i>

248
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,890
Yeah? Okay.

249
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,894
- It's good to see you, Ram.
- Good to see you. Goddamn.

250
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,625
I haven't seen you in a while.
How you been?

251
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,930
Now, I'm telling you, it was one of
the historic matches in history.

252
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,596
It was 20,000 people.

253
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,538
Another million and a half sitting
at home watching it on pay-per-view.

254
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,701
We're slamming the piss
out of each other.

255
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,712
I mean, for God knows how long.
We're both gassing.

256
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,409
You ask any wrestling fan,
they've heard about that one.

257
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,917
- Million and a half. Shit.
- Oh, yeah, it was big.

258
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,250
And a rematch?
Hey. This could be history all over again.

259
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,292
Goddamn, look at you.
You are one smoking baby. Mmm.

260
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,853
Let me make an honest
woman out of you.

261
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,865
Hmm?

262
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:10,163
I mean, who knows?
I'm in pretty good shape right now.

263
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:13,102
You know, with a little luck,
this could be my ticket back on top.

264
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,663
- You never know who's in that crowd.
- Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,732
That would be a dream.

266
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,045
Oh, Jesus. You're bleeding.

267
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,742
- Oh!
- Yeah, I got cut tonight.

268
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,750
Oh!

269
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:29,787
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's nothin'

270
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,824
- They say wrestling's fake, huh?
- Fake? I'll show you fake.

271
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,415
Look at this.
1986, Denver Coliseum.

272
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,927
Billy Bob Banjo hit me
with a two-by-four.

273
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,964
It had a loose nail in it,
split my bicep right the hell open.

274
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:43,865
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Look at that. I got a better one than that.

275
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:45,903
Take a look at this here.

276
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,101
1988, okay?
Orlando Civic Center.

277
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,734
Mr. Magnificent threw me
over the top ropes.

278
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,144
I landed on my shoulder
and cracked my clavicle right in half.

279
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:58,478
Oh, my God.
Does it hurt?

280
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,212
Well, it hurts when I breathe, but, I mean,
you know, you hear the roar of the crowd...

281
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,585
you just...
you motor through, you know?

282
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,092
"He was pierced
for our transgressions.

283
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,252
"He was crushed for our iniquities.

284
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,888
"The punishment that brought us
peace was upon him...

285
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:16,023
and by his wounds we were healed."

286
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,968
Hmm. What was that all about?

287
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,096
It's <i>The Passion of the Christ.</i>
You have the same hair.

288
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,607
- You never seen it?
- No.

289
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:27,076
Dude, you gotta!
It's... It's amazing.

290
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:30,546
- They throw everything at him...
whips, arrows, rocks.
- Hmm.

291
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,584
They beat the living fuck out of him
the whole two hours, and...

292
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,143
- he just takes it.
- Hmm.

293
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,282
Tough dude.

294
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,556

00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,858
Just need the juice,
and you're all right, then, right?

328
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,335
- I'm just gonna get big and strong.
- Yes, you are, my friend.

329
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:34,337
- Okay.
- All right? Anytime, man.

330
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,396
- You're looking good, brother.
- I'm trying, baby. I'm trying.

331
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,204
- Show me what you got there.
- Ah, come on, man. Come on.

332
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,109
- Show me what you got.
- Just a little something.
There's not much there, baby.

333
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,807
- Come on.
- Bring it up. Bring it up. Look at that motherfucker.

334
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,943
- Okay, right up there. See?
What you're doing right there.
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,474
Don't... Don't leave the foils on too long,
because last time they broke off.

336
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,250
I think they got too fried.

337
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,951
Yeah. I got it.

338
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,928
So, how's the old man
doing these days?

339
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,964
Yeah?

340
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:36,090
- Work, work, work.
- Work, work, work. Well, hey.

341
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,603
Hmm. At least he's got a job, right?

342
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,272
- Hey, Gloria. How you doin'
- Hey, babe. Five's open.

343
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,009
- Thanks again for the lift, bro.
- You got it.

344
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,343
Here you go.
Lay it on, brother. Lay it on.

345
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,576
- Like... Like...
- There you go.

346
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,777
You're supposed to fall to your knees.

347
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,912
- Ooh.
- All right. Good.

348
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,958
- Where's the bug spray in here? Huh?
- Lane six on the right side.

349
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,959
- The right side, bottom.
- Right side, bug spray.

350
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,031
- Hmm?
- Go ahead. Once more.

351
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,500
- Now give it to me, brother.
- All right, man.

352
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,268
Fuck. Come on. Let's...

353
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,605
- Couple mousetraps?
- Load 'em and set 'em in the ring, body slam.

354
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,611
Hmm. Let's do it.

355
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,340
- How you doing, sir?
- How you doing?

356
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:00,942
- What's going on, my man?
- Tell me, what do you think?
What do you think about this?

357
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,452
Huh?

358
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,011
Huh?

359
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,059
- That'll work.
- Okay.

360
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:11,253
Come here.

361
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,297
Ah!

362
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:21,704
- <i>I don't look good, but I feel good.</i>
- Yeah.

363
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:25,209
So, my... my knees, my back,
anything you need me to do, sir.

364
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,300
Just maybe, uh, keep
the running to a minimum.

365
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:31,247
Like maybe I can hit the ropes once, take a bump
for you, but, like, no crisscrossing, please.

366
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,912
This hard-core stuff. What do you... Talk to
me about it. What do you wanna do tonight?

367
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,921
Well, are you cool with the staples?

368
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,048
- Staples?
- Staple gun.

369
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,152
- What do you mean?
- Like... staple gun.

370
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,197
- Staple gun.
- Yeah. You never did it before?

371
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,824
- Uh, no. Does that hurt?
- Silly question, but yeah.

372
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,266
- Man, uh, not so bad going in.
- Yeah.

373
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,327
Kind of scary. You know, you got a big
metal thing up against you, but...

374
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:57,864
pulling them out, they're gonna leave a couple
little holes, a little bit of blood loss there.

375
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,036
- Rock and roll.
- <i>Thank you, sir. It's an honor. Thank you.</i>

376
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,546
- Take it easy with that staple gun.
- <i>No problem, sir.</i>

377
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,015
<i>Dead! You're so dead!</i>

<i>Well, much better

<i>You need to start

Like how?
What do I do?

455
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,320
<i>Well, for starters, you're going
to be on a slew of medications.</i>

456
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:09,492
<i>And the stuff that you're putting in
your body... you need to cut it out.</i>

457
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,297
I know. I know. I can...

458
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,862
I can... I can do without that.

459
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,434
When can I, uh,
get back in the gym and, uh...

460
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,637
start working out?

461
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:27,150
As far as exercise goes, it's still okay,
as long as it's moderate.

462
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:29,583
Doc, I'm a professional wrestler.

463
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,416
That's not a good idea.

464
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:34,780
Well, what do you mean?

465
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,554
<i>Well, your heart
has been through a lot.</i>

466
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,255
<i>It won't be able to handle
a strenuous activity.</i>

467
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,260
Well, I can slow my routine down.
I can... I can just pace myself.

Did I what?

493
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,713
- Call of Duty 4?
- What?

494
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,012
- Call of Duty 4.
- Call "It" Duty 4?

495
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,711
- Call <i>of</i> Duty 4.
- Call <i>of</i> Duty 4?

496
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:33,483
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, actually.
- Really?

497
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:37,322
<i>This game is so old.</i>

498
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:41,922
- Wh... What's it about?
- It's a war game. Most all the other Call of Duties...

499
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:45,798
they were, like, based on World War II,
but this one's with Iraq.

500
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:47,804
- Oh, yeah?
- And... Yeah.

501
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,806
You switch off between a Marine...

502
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:52,206
and an "S" and "S" British
special operative...

503
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:55,677
- so it's pretty cool.
- Wow.

504
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,838
<i>Hold on. All right. Hold on.
There we go.</i>

505
00:41:57,914 --> 00:42:00,782
<i>All right. Here... There! There it is!
Ram Jam! You're finished.</i>

506
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,784
- <i>Okay, one more.</i>
- I gotta go.

507
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,786
- Huh?
- I... I gotta leave.

508
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,880
- I just gave you an ass-whipping.
Don't you wanna get even?
- Nah, that's okay.

509
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,449
- All right.
- I... I'll catch you later, all right?

510
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,461
All right.
See you later, man.

511
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,498
- Do your push-ups, brother.
- All right.

512
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:59,240
Oh, fuck.

513
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,326
- Hey!
- Hey.

514
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,460
Ram man!
Been a while.

515
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,563
- Hmm.
- Hi.

516
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,440
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood, thought
maybe we could go grab a... a hamburger.

517
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,501
I'm working.

518
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,014
Okay. You know, maybe later.

519
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,074
You okay?

520
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,577
- Could we talk for a second?
- Sure.

521
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,179
Sure. What's up?
What's up?

522
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,224
No, I mean somewhere quiet, not...

523
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,284
Randy...

524
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,831
I can't leave with
a customer, you know.

525
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,630
Listen. I had a heart attack.

526
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:05,541
<i>I know.</i>

527
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:08,077
- Where you parked?
- Out in the back.

528
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,978
Good. Go to your car.
I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes.

529
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:13,141
<i>So, they're just fucking,
or what's the story?</i>

530
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,913
You know what?
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go on break.

531
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,755
- I need a cigarette. I can't quit.
- Okay.

532
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,936
- Hey.
- <i>Thanks. I appreciate it.</i>

533
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:40,407
No, it's okay.

534
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:43,844
- <i>When was it?</i>
- Uh, a couple weeks ago.

535
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:47,077
Oh. How are you feeling?

536
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,780
Oh.
I don't feel like Hercules.

537
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:53,880
- What happened?
- <i>I just-</i>

538
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:58,121
I was walking in the dressing room,
and the guys told me I just...

539
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,427
dropped like a brick,
and, you know, I don't remember nothin'

540
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:06,902
Now the doctors tell me, uh...

541
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:08,903
that I can't...

542
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,065
that I can't wrestle no more.

543
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:15,300
What are you gonna do?

544
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:19,610
You know,
it just don't feel... right.

545
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,141
And that's why...

546
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,416
That's why I wanted
to talk to you, you know.

547
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:28,856
'Cause I don't want to be alone.

548
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,396
Randy.

549
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,634
You should be with your family now.

550
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,070
Don't you have a daughter?
Where's your daughter?

551
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,132
Uh, my daughter...
she don't like me very much.

552
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,804
<i>I don't believe it.
Everybody needs a father...</i>

553
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,313
and... trust me...

554
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,646
this kind of thing
brings people together.

555
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:57,414
Ah-

556
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,081
<i>You should call her.</i>

557
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:03,148
I should go back in.

558
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:05,490
You're gonna be okay, huh?

559
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:08,121
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.

560
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:30,208
Stephanie.

561
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,751
Hi, this is Stephanie.
Leave a message.

562
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,920
Ah...

563
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,353
Man.

564
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:01,239
Oh. Uh, is, uh, Stephanie home?

565
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:06,447
- Who can I say it is?
- Uh, tell her it's her father.

566
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,695
Hey. Stephanie.

567
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,438
- Where you goin'?
- What do you want?

568
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:34,202
Well, I just... I have to talk to you.

569
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:36,211
I can't really talk right now.

570
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,771
- I really need to talk to you.
- I have school.

571
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,782
- You're going to school?
- Yeah.

572
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,818
Well, that's great.

573
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:48,050
Listen. I had a heart attack...

574
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,356
and I just thought
I needed to tell you.

575
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,331
You are such an asshole.

576
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,335
What do you want from me?

577
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,393
<i>What do you want?</i>

578
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,530
I just been alone, and, uh...

579
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:07,338
you're my daughter, and I love you,
and I just... I just needed to see you.

580
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,402
That's bullshit.

581
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,469
You want me to take care of you.

582
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,208
- No.
- <i>Yes.</i>

583
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:16,911
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

584
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,445
'Cause where the fuck were you
when I needed you to take care of me?

585
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:22,458
You know, on all my birthdays...

586
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,516
<i>which you never even made one.</i>

587
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:28,030
<i>You probably don't even
know when it is.</i>

588
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:32,501
So, you know what? No. I don't care
if you had a heart attack. Fuck you!

589
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,653
- Oh! Ram.
- Hey.

590
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:54,748
- Didn't think I'd see you here.
- Why not?

591
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:55,849
- Hey.
- Hey.

592
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:58,224
I heard you collapsed
at the DiFusco show.

593
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,628
Ah, man, I just overheated
and blacked out. That's all.

594
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:04,565
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah, I was out of the hospital in less than an hour.

595
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,431
- <i>So, you're fine?</i>
- Brother, I'm good to go.

596
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:10,905
That's excellent!
I was just gonna cancel the minivan.

597
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,704
- What minivan?
- I rented one for Fanfest.

598
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,710
Yeah, m-me and the whole
gang's driving down.

599
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:18,110
Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback.

600
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,148
Oh, I'm so fucking psyched!

601
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,514
<i>Volpe gave me an assload offlyers.</i>

602
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:27,349
Yeah. It's gonna be epic.

603
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:30,552
<i>Volpe said the scout from
the show was gonna be there.</i>

604
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:32,719
- Uh...
- <i>Twenty years in the making.</i>

605
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,628
- It's gonna be something.
- Yeah. Come on. I got you set up down here.

606
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,099
- Hey, bro.
- Hey. What's going on, bro?

607
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:41,637
So, uh, yeah.
Should get a pretty good crowd today.

608
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:44,606
Oh. Great.
I'll, uh... I'll loosen up.

609
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,641
All right.

610
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,577
- Hey, my man. How you doing, big guy?
Good to see you. Wow.
- Haven't seen you in a while.

611
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,454
<i>- Smile.
- Who makes your T-shirts?</i>

612
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,831
<i>I like your T-shirts.</i>

613
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,836
- How much for an autograph?
- Ten dollars.

614
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,998
- Ram. Been a big fan of yours for years.
- Hey. How you doin', brother?

615
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,942
- It's really great to meet you. Can I get a Polaroid?
- All right. Absolutely.

616
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,978
Okay. Ready, guys?

617
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:24,911
<i>Ram!</i>

618
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,914
- What's your name again?
- <i>Evan.</i>

619
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:30,918
- Evan. E-E-V...
- E-V-A-N.

620
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,320
- <i>One, two, Ram!</i>
- There we go.

621
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,018
Okay, it's eight.
There you go, Matthew.

622
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,028
- Here you go.
- Yeah, hold on.

623
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,239
<i>Well, no. It's $30.</i>

624
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,666
<i>You gotta get the VHS.
I'll give you the VHS.</i>

625
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,038
Hi, I'm Cassidy.

626
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:29,010
- Henry.
- Nice to meet you. Where you from?

627
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,137
- Garfield.
- Yeah?

628
00:52:31,213 --> 00:52:33,148
How you doing tonight?

629
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,309
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm?

630
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,012
How about a private dance,
make you feel a little better?

631
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,318
- Mmm, no, not tonight.
- No, Henry?

632
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,722
- No.
- No? Okay.

633
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,521
<i>And don't forget
Tuesday night is-</i>

634
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:50,931
<i>♪ Is how you dance
You're up to no... ♪</i>

635
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,059
Nah.

636
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:59,266
<i>On the main stage, the exotic-</i>

637
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,768
<i>Hey. Hey, you.</i>

638
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,940
Hey. When'd you get here?

639
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:09,007
- <i>I just flew in.</i>
- You did?

640
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,521
- How you been feeling?
- I'm feeling good.

641
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:15,056
- A lot better.
- Good.

642
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,525
And I took your advice.
I went and saw my daughter.

643
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:20,755
Yeah? How did that go?

644
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,764
Uh, it didn't go very well.

645
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:25,356
She sort of ripped me a new asshole.

646
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,369
Oh. Oh.
Sorry to hear that.

647
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:29,063
Oh, hey.
What are you gonna do?

648
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,969
Oh, just...

649
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,875
Maybe if I went out
and did something special, you know?

650
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,936
- Bought her a present.
- That's a really great idea.

651
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,481
- Well...
- What's she into?

652
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,710
Hmm. Yeah, I don't really...
You know.

653
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,878
What kind of music does she like?

654
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:46,980
I really don't know.

655
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:51,117
Well, is she into something else,
like, well, cooking or books or something?

656
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:53,184
Oh.

657
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:58,161
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well...

658
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,965
you should get her clothes,
like some kind of clothes.

659
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:02,936
- All girls like that. Yeah.
- Yeah?

660
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:05,838
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Hey. I know the right place.

661
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,844
It's this kick-ass little vintage shop
in Elizabeth.

662
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,438
- Ah.
- I think it's on Elizabeth Avenue.

663
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:15,210
You should go on Saturday.
That's when they get all the best shit.

664
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:17,445
Hey, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

665
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,445
You want a dance?

666
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:26,027
I don't think
I'm quite ready for that yet.

667
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:30,655
Okay.

Listen. Why don't I meet you
there on Saturday...

674
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:05,532
and, um... and help you
pick something out?

675
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:09,695
- Wow. I'd like that a lot.
- Oh.

676
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,329

- Yeah.

Yeah, 1:00.

679
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,690
Hey. Whoa.

680
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,728
Did you forget how to knock?

681
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:37,594
- No.
- Let's try that again, all right? I'm serious.

682
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,844
What do you want?

683
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:53,177
Well, I was wondering if I could
get some more work... something, uh...

684
00:55:53,248 --> 00:55:55,273
- you know, steady, full-time.
- Ah, cell phone.

685
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,284
All I got is weekends.

686
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,378
Yeah, well, that works.

687
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:02,581
Isn't that when you sit on
other dudes' faces?

688
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:07,889
- So, what do you got?
- <i>Deli counter.</i>

689
00:56:07,963 --> 00:56:11,523
- Deli counter.
Dealing with the customers and stuff?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

690
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,795
A parade of hot, horny housewives...

691
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,802
begging for your meat.

692
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,800
- You got anything else?
- No, I do not.

693
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,400
You interested?

694
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:27,637
Yeah. Sure.

695
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:50,735
- Hey!
- Hey.

696
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:53,036
Goddamn.
I almost didn't recognize you.

697
00:56:53,108 --> 00:56:55,338
You look... You look clean.

698
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,969
Clean?

699
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,807
No, I mean you look lovely.

700
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,748
Okay. Thanks.

701
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:05,684
Uh, listen. Should I call you, uh,
Pam or Cassidy or what?

702
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:07,516
- Pam.
- <i>Pam.</i>

703
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:09,523
Don't get used to it.

704
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,717
What is she?

705
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:14,092
Goth? Punk? Hippie?

706
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:17,155
- Preppy?
- Oh, man, I ain't got a clue.

707
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,992
Oh. Hey, Pam.

708
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:24,163
- <i>Pam.</i>
- Yeah. Mm-hmm?

709
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,036
Thank you.
I really appreciate this.

710
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,001
You're welcome.

711
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,172
<i>Uh, listen.</i>

712
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,375
I think Stephanie is, uh...

713
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,385
a lesbian.

714
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:38,976
Uh-huh?

715
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:41,351
Does that make
a difference what she...

716
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,219
No.

717
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:47,284
- <i>It's cool.</i>
- I mean, or maybe it's all in my head. I don't know.

718
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:52,400
Oh, wow. What about this?

719
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,992
Look at this.
Got an "S" on it.

720
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,300
- Um...
- That looks perfect, huh?

721
00:57:58,306 --> 00:58:00,400
Well...

722
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:04,503
I mean, it's winter, so maybe you want
something warmer, like a peacoat.

723
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:06,706
You got a point there.

724
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:09,648
- If you know her size.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

725
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:12,481
I don't know, man.
I think that's pretty rock and roll.

726
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:16,045
- What do you think?
- I...

727
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:19,126
You should go with your gut, man.

728
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:20,684
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

729
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:24,425
You know, you look so goddamn pretty
in the daytime.

730
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,230
Hey, have a beer with me?

731
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:30,396
Uh, I gotta get going.

732
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:32,804
- <i>One beer.</i>
- I really...

733
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,277
I got a... I got a kid.

734
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,246
You have a kid?

735
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:42,248
<i>Well.</i>

736
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:45,581
- What do you have, a boy or girl?
- <i>Boy. Jameson.</i>

737
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:48,213
- So, how old?
- Nine.

738
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,521
Wow. Hmm.
Who would figure, huh?

739
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:54,994
Well, it's not something
I usually tell the customers.

740
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:58,088
It's not exactly...
It's not a turn-on.

741
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:02,126
Uh, hold on.
Wait a second.

742
00:59:11,646 --> 00:59:14,445
I want you to give this
to your little guy. It's a...

743
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,916
<i>It's a Randy the Ram
action figure.</i>

744
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:19,976
Tell him not to lose it.
It's a $300 collector's item.

745
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,956
- Really?
- No.

746
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:26,619
Come on. Hey, one beer.

747
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,925
Okay.

748
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:34,264
That's a great-looking kid
you got there.

749
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:36,565
I think so.

750
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:39,436
Well, I can see where
he got his good looks from.

751
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:42,806
Yeah. Well, he doesn't
get it from his father.

752
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:48,342
What's that?

753
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,817
Oh, that's this condo thing
down in Trenton.

754
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,778
What are you thinking about,
moving there?

755
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:56,789
- Workin' on it. Yeah.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

756
00:59:56,858 --> 00:59:59,018
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the schools
are really awesome...

757
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:02,427
<i>great neighborhood, and... cheaper.</i>

758
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,795
What about your gig
over at, uh, Cheeques?

759
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:08,199
Done. Quitting.

760
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:13,030
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

761
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:18,271
Whoa! Hell, yeah!

762
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:20,110
<i>All right!

01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:22,480

765
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:26,150

01:00:26,221 --> 01:00:30,317

This is supposed to say "Randy."

798
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:29,976
I guess they got it
off your W-4 or something.

799
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:32,275
So I really gotta wear
one of these things?

800
01:02:33,347 --> 01:02:35,873
No, you're special.

801
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:38,715
Well, uh, can you change it?

802
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:41,119
Just wear the fuckin' thing,

01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:43,123
Ah.

01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:11,376
Oh, fuck.

805
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:15,344
Uh, here's your bologna, pal.

806
01:04:19,086 --> 01:04:22,021
Eighteen.

807
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,922
Are... Are they all on sale,
or just the regular ones?

808
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:28,190
- The Hudson Acres. Uh...
- Well, it wasn't very clear.

809
01:04:28,262 --> 01:04:30,925
- Let me check.
- <i>Okay.</i>

810
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:36,269
Wayne, to the deli counter.

01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:38,635
It'll just be a minute.

812
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:43,302
<i>Okay. So, uh, which, in your opinion,
is the best smoked ham?</i>

813
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:45,811
- The best what?
- Smoked ham.

814
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,179
- Uh...
- Which?

815
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:51,646
I don't...
Smoked ham, I guess...

816
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:53,880
Uh, the maple-glazed is not bad.

817
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:03,456
- Breasts, thighs.
- Breasts, thighs.

818
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,088
- Small pieces.
- Right.

819
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,498
- Lock it up. Push start.
- Yes.

820
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,476
<i>Forty-six.</i>

821
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:28,079
- What would you like?
- Can I have a half a pound of pesto pasta salad?

822
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:29,646
Okay. Comin' up.

823
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:34,855
Half a pound of pesto pasta
on the button.

824
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:39,530
- Can I get you anything else?
- <i>No, that's it.</i>

825
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:43,128
- You have a lovely day, darling.
- Thanks. You too.

826
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:49,208
Forty-seven.

827
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:55,639
- Let me get a eight-piece, uh, chicken.
- <i>What kind of chicken you want?</i>

828
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:59,175
I want a eight-piece.
That's two breasts.

829
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:02,222
- Give me two big breasts.
- Two big breasts, coming up.

830
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:04,918
That's what I want. Two big breasts.

831
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:08,860
Two big breasts...
Uh, something with a brain.

832
01:06:08,929 --> 01:06:12,365
- And two wings? Yeah, stay away from them thighs.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

833
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:15,630
A lot of chicken flying out the door.
There you go, honey. Have a good day.

834
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,797
- <i>Thank you. Have a good day.</i>
- Who's next?

835
01:06:17,871 --> 01:06:19,806
- <i>Me.</i>
- What you having, good-looking?

836
01:06:19,873 --> 01:06:22,934
- Uh, half a pound of egg salad.
- Half a pound of egg salad, coming up.

837
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,914
- Here we go.
- <i>Fresh?</i>

838
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,246
- Fresh? Fresh as monkey's breath, brother.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

839
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:32,251
Oh, yeah.
This is the good stuff.

840
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,311
Comin' up.
Down and out. Come on.

841
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:37,380
It's the fourth quarter.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

842
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:40,360
<i>There's 12 seconds left.
Go. Down and out. Here. Both hands.</i>

843
01:06:40,427 --> 01:06:44,659
<i>Hey! Touchdown! Goddamn!
How about them Cowboys?</i>

844
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:46,666
- What you having, spring chicken?
- Hi.

845
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:48,668
Okay.

846
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:54,204
- Hey, Migg, how you doing?
- Who is this?

847
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:57,869
- Yeah, it's the Ram.
- Hey, Ram. Good to hear from you.
We gonna see you in two weeks?

848
01:06:57,945 --> 01:07:01,244
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.
- It's gonna be big. I got 12 calls already.

849
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:05,411
Listen, uh, you're gonna have to
count me out of Utica.

850
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:08,478
What do you mean?
We've been selling tickets for a week!

851
01:07:08,556 --> 01:07:11,023
Nah, I'm retiring.

852
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,762
- Hey, Frank, how you doin'
- Good, Ram. Good. How are you?

853
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:21,563
Nah, I'm good, man.
I'm good. Uh, listen.

854
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,708
Oh, come on. I'm sorry, Volpe.
You know I'd kill to do it.

855
01:07:30,778 --> 01:07:34,077
- I already bought Bob's plane ticket.
- No, I realize. I understand.

856
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:36,742
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Nah, no more. I am done.

857
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:38,751
- I'm retired.
- Yeah, I... I... I know.

858
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:12,315
<i>Stephanie.</i>

859
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:14,320
What, are you stalking me?

860
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:18,484
No. I, uh, brought you a present.

861
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:21,895
Go ahead. Open it.

862
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:35,266
The "S" stands for "Stephanie."

863
01:08:35,342 --> 01:08:37,435
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

864
01:08:37,511 --> 01:08:39,445
Do you like it?

865
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,448
It's, uh... It's shiny.

866
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:45,645
That's not really your present.
I got you something else.

867
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,654
Hold on.

868
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:54,394
This is your real present.

869
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,332
- It's a peacoat.
- Yeah. Well, it's wintertime...

870
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:09,204
and I want you to keep warm.

871
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:14,842
- Thank you.
- Hey, anything for you, sweetheart.

872
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:17,578
So what are you doing right now?

873
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:19,586
What am I doing?

874
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:23,886
You know, I thought maybe we could,
you know, stop by our old favorite place.

875
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:26,926
We have an old favorite place?

876
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:29,429
You'll recognize it when you see it.

877
01:09:32,065 --> 01:09:34,591
Uh, now's not really
the best time. I...

878
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,829
I got some stuff I gotta do.

879
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,395
What kind of stuff?

880
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:42,203
Just stuff.

881
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:44,768
Come on.
I'm not gonna, like...

882
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:47,041
I'm not gonna take a bite
out of you or anything.

883
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:50,015
Just, you know,
hang out for a little while.

884
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,957
I haven't been here in ages.

885
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,652
You remember the fun house?

886
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:05,927
Right there.
Used to be the Monster Motel.

887
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,934
- Kinda.
- Oh, you loved it.

888
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:11,403
We used to go in there,
and they had this, uh, spooky-ass skeleton.

889
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:13,735
It would pop out of a coffin.

890
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,242
You'd get really scared
and cry and wanna run out.

891
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:20,407
And then... then you'd beg
to go back in again.

892
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,041
Oh. Always was a glutton
for punishment.

893
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:25,641
Yeah, you wouldn't go in
unless you could sit on my foot...

894
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,654
and wrap your arms around my leg.

895
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:30,417
And we'd walk all the way
through like that.

896
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:34,359
Ah, I don't even remember that.

897
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:36,420
I do.

898
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:49,436
I just want to tell you.

899
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,444
<i>I'm the one...</i>

900
01:10:51,511 --> 01:10:54,447
who was supposed to
take care of everything.

901
01:10:54,515 --> 01:10:59,475
I'm the one who was supposed to make
everything okay for everybody.

902
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:05,052
But it just didn't
work out like that.

903
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:07,060
And I left.

904
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:09,061
I left you.

905
01:11:10,297 --> 01:11:12,765
You never did anything wrong.

906
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,099
You know?
I used to try to...

907
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,104
Huh! Forget about you.

908
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:21,868
I used to try to pretend that...

909
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:24,877
you didn't exist.

910
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:26,880
But I can't.

911
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:31,318
You're my girl.

912
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:34,685
<i>You're my little...
You're my little girl.</i>

913
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:38,082
<i>And now-</i>

914
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:44,054
I'm an old,
broken-down piece of meat.

915
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,659
And I'm alone.

916
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,828
<i>And I deserve to be all alone.</i>

917
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:55,335
I just don't want you to hate me.

918
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:03,917
Okay?

919
01:12:28,408 --> 01:12:30,342
Hey.

920
01:12:33,814 --> 01:12:35,748
Oh.

921
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:39,751
Oh, man, we can't go in there.

922
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,755
Come on.

923
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,893
Oh, God.

924
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:54,296
- Whoo, man. Wow.
- This must have been a ballroom or something.

925
01:12:55,703 --> 01:12:58,034
Oh, look at this.
We can...

926
01:12:58,105 --> 01:13:00,039
Hey, here we go.

927
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:04,340
- What is that?
- It's my bow to you.

928
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:08,648
Am I supposed to bow back?
I bow to you?

929
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,649
Ah.

930
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:20,126
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

931
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:27,500
You can lead.
You're not bad.

932
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:29,899
Well, thank you.

933
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:40,891
Hold on.

934
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:44,650
Wait.
Let me get the door.

935
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,018
Well, I hope that wasn't
too painful for you.

936
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:55,926
- No, it was okay.
- Yeah, well...

937
01:13:55,997 --> 01:13:58,465
Okay, uh, bye.

938
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,659
Bye.

939
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:03,726
Hey, maybe we could
go out to dinner sometime.

940
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:06,204
- Dinner?
- You know, on Friday or something?

941
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,842
Whatever works for you.

942
01:14:11,212 --> 01:14:13,442
Saturday would be better.

943
01:14:13,514 --> 01:14:15,505
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

944
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:17,516
You got it.

945
01:14:22,122 --> 01:14:24,056
Oh, wow.

946
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,462
Wow.

947
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:29,212
<i>Hey, you there. Hey.</i>

948
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,726
Come on. Open it.

949
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,737
I'll wait till later
when it's quiet.

950
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:47,534
Oh, come on.
I want to watch your face when you read it.

951
01:16:01,521 --> 01:16:03,456
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

952
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:07,551
Hey, thank <i>you.</i>
I mean, come on, baby. You saved my ass.

953
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:12,962
What?

954
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,967
I can't... do this.

955
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:18,301
Can't do what?

956
01:16:18,372 --> 01:16:20,363
This.

957
01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:23,867
I thought we had
a little something going on here.

958
01:16:23,944 --> 01:16:28,006
<i>No. W... Well... I... I think you're
awesome. I think that you're a great guy.</i>

959
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,673
So what's the problem?

960
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,550
You think that I'm, like,
this stripper, and I'm not.

961
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:35,645
I'm a mom.

962
01:16:35,722 --> 01:16:39,283
I have responsibilities.
I have a son.

963
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,021
<i>Anyway, you don't want
that fuckin'luggage, so-</i>

964
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:44,792
What if I do?

965
01:16:44,864 --> 01:16:46,798
I can't go there.

966
01:16:46,867 --> 01:16:49,529
- <i>What about the other day?</i>
- It was a mistake.

967
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:53,171
It didn't feel like a mistake to me.

968
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:56,333
The club and the real world...
they don't mix.

969
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:59,173
I don't know. I'll tell you,
I think that's a lot of bullshit...

970
01:16:59,246 --> 01:17:02,511
because I think
you still feel something.

971
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:07,212
You're a customer, okay? You're a fucking
customer. I don't go out with customers.

972
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:09,619
<i>You got it?</i>

973
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:11,423
Yeah, I got it.

974
01:17:11,492 --> 01:17:13,208
<i>Hey, can I have some
tequila over here, please?</i>

975
01:17:13,274 --> 01:17:14,421
<i>Sure.</i>

976
01:17:14,494 --> 01:17:17,953
<i>I tell you what. Here.</i>

977
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:21,001
- <i>What's that?</i>
- I want a dance.

978
01:17:21,068 --> 01:17:22,796
Stop it.

979
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:25,337
What's the matter?
You gonna refuse a paying customer?

980
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:27,896
- I want a goddamn dance, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

981
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:30,341
- Get up there and move your ass.
Squeeze your titties together.
- <i>Fuck off!</i>

982
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:32,037
- Shake your fucking ass...
- Fuck you!

983
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:33,704
<i>Ram!</i>
And pretend you like me!

984
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,408
<i>- Gimme a goddamn dance!
- Get the fuck outta here!</i>

985
01:17:36,484 --> 01:17:39,078
<i>- Ram! Let's take it outside.
- Want a drink, my man?</i>

986
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:41,087
<i>No, I'm okay.</i>

987
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:05,935
Oh, God.

988
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:28,993
- <i>Ram! Hey, man. What's happening?</i>
- Hey, Larry.

989
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:31,470
How ya doin' What are you doing here?
I thought you retired.

990
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:33,939
- I did. I just came to see the show.
- Well, come in.

991
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:35,942
Come on, man. Of course.

Ram! Ram!

993
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:41,310
Hey, what's up there?
I haven't seen you for a while.

994
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:43,747
All good?

995
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,934
Yeah!

996
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:19,511
One, two, three!

997
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:24,256
- Hey!
- Ram!

998
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:26,315
- You guys were great.
- What's up? Did you like it?

999
01:19:26,393 --> 01:19:28,759
- Yeah, it was a hell of a show.
- Appreciate it, man.

1000
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:30,762
- You were fast. You looked good.
- 'Cause of this guy, man.

1001
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,698
- Nah, 'cause of this guy.
- Hey. What's important... they liked you.

1002
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:35,257
- Exactly.
- They did. They loved it.

1003
01:19:35,336 --> 01:19:38,305
- So how you been, man?
- Well, hanging and swinging, brother.

1004
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:41,636
- You swing. I get a couple drinks.
- Get a drink? You buying?

1005
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,198
- I'll buy for you.
- Yeah, you buying.

1006
01:19:43,277 --> 01:19:47,270
Fifty even.

1007
01:19:54,121 --> 01:19:57,818
<i>Oh. Thanks, Meliss.</i>

1008
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,292
- You know, I know who you are.
- Well, cheers.

1009
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,828
Mmm.

1010
01:20:02,896 --> 01:20:05,694
My brother used to have
your poster on his door.

1011
01:20:05,765 --> 01:20:07,926
Well, your brother's got good taste.

1012
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:10,128
<i>Yeah, it was a pretty hot picture.</i>

1013
01:20:10,203 --> 01:20:12,637
So, what are you doing
in our town of Rahway?

1014
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:14,900
<i>We did a show over at
the rec center tonight.</i>

1015
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:17,204
Wrestling.
Wow. So you still wrestle?

1016
01:20:18,645 --> 01:20:21,409
- Still jumping off the top rope.
- <i>Oh, wow.</i>

1017
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:23,712
That's hot.

1018
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:26,184
So, uh, do you want to party?

1019
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:29,916
Party?
What do you call party?

1020
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:31,923
I don't know.

1021
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:33,926
Party like a fireman party.

1022
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:40,733
Oh, shit, that's speedy.

1023
01:20:43,636 --> 01:20:44,796
Oh!

1024
01:20:50,109 --> 01:20:52,043
Oh, get a fucking room.

1025
01:20:52,112 --> 01:20:54,046
Oh, yeah!

1026
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,466
Oh.

1027
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,757
Oh. Ooh.

1028
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,445
Oh, fuck.

1029
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:04,905
Oh.

1030
01:22:22,703 --> 01:22:24,801
Oh, God.

1031
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:38,618
Oh, shit.

1032
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,761
Oh, sh... Oh, shit!

1033
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:00,963
Fuck!

1034
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,975
Goddamn it!

1035
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:16,688
Hey, uh, is Stephanie home?

1036
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:25,256
<i>Steph, guess who
finally decided to show up.</i>

1037
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:27,527
<i>Yeah, he's standing outside.</i>

1038
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:32,305
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i>

1039
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:38,742
<i>I've seen you get stressed out. I don't want you
to be stressed. Let me get this asshole out.</i>

1040
01:23:38,811 --> 01:23:40,301
- <i>Just don't, don't say anything.</i>
- Hey.

1041
01:23:40,381 --> 01:23:42,747
<i>- Who said you could come in?
- What are you doing in here?</i>

1042
01:23:42,815 --> 01:23:44,875
- <i>I'm sorry, Stephanie. I'm so sorry.</i>
- No, get the fuck out!

1043
01:23:44,952 --> 01:23:47,386
- I'm gonna handle this, okay? I can handle this.
- Obviously not.

1044
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:51,150
- I can handle this!
- <i>Oh, come on. I'm sorry I screwed this up.</i>

1045
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,886
- I'm so sorry.
- <i>Wait. Don't worry.</i>

1046
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,587
<i>- I just... You don't have to leave.
- I'll be back.</i>

1047
01:23:55,662 --> 01:23:57,686
Fuck.

1048
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:00,393
I waited in that restaurant for two hours...
Two fucking hours...

1049
01:24:00,466 --> 01:24:02,900
telling myself, " Maybe something happened.
Maybe he's stuck in traffic."

1050
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:05,564
But, no! You just keep doing
the same shit to me over and over again!

1051
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:07,265
I know, and I apologize.
Look, I apologize.

1052
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:09,467
I got a lot of stuff
swimming around in my head...

1053
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,103
and I went out and had a drink,
and another drink, and I just spaced.

1054
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,614
- That is tough shit!
- Goddamn it. Why do I do this to you?

1055
01:24:15,681 --> 01:24:18,617
Because you are a fuck-up!

1056
01:24:19,886 --> 01:24:22,515
<i>You're a living,
breathing fuck-up...</i>

1057
01:24:22,588 --> 01:24:24,716
and I cannot fucking do it anymore!

1058
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:28,319
I can't stand it! I can't fucking cry
for you! I can't fucking do it anymore!

1059
01:24:28,395 --> 01:24:29,588
I can't fucking...

1060
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:32,826
<i>- You are a fucking asshole!
- Calm down. Stop.</i>

1061
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:35,198
- You are an asshole! You're a fucking asshole!
- Calm down. Calm down.

1062
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:37,463
- Go fuck yourself! Go fuck...
- Calm down. Calm down.

1063
01:24:37,537 --> 01:24:39,938
- Do not touch me! I fucking hate you!
- I'm sorry. I know.

1064
01:24:40,006 --> 01:24:43,305
- I fucking hate you!
- I know you hate me. I know you do.

1065
01:24:43,377 --> 01:24:45,470
I know you hate me.

1066
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:49,345
- Calm down.
- You know what? I don't care.

1067
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:52,510
I don't hate you.
I don't love you.

1068
01:24:52,586 --> 01:24:54,780
I don't even like you.

1069
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:57,948
- And I was stupid to think that you could change.
- I can... I can change.

1070
01:24:58,024 --> 01:25:01,426
- I don't care.
- Come on.

1071
01:25:01,494 --> 01:25:05,328
There is no more fixing this.

1072
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:08,731
It's broke. Permanently.

1073
01:25:10,002 --> 01:25:13,996
And I'm okay with that.
It's better.

1074
01:25:14,073 --> 01:25:17,042
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1075
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:24,349
I don't ever want to see you again.

1076
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:28,519
Look at me.

1077
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:30,579
I don't want to see you.

1078
01:25:30,657 --> 01:25:33,626
I don't want to hear you.

1079
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:35,627
I am done.

1080
01:25:35,695 --> 01:25:39,188
Do you understand?
Done.

1081
01:25:41,702 --> 01:25:43,693
Get out.

1082
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:13,661
Twenty-seven.

1083
01:26:13,734 --> 01:26:17,693
<i>Here. Apound of
German potato salad, please.</i>

1084
01:26:22,242 --> 01:26:24,801
Okay.

1085
01:26:27,213 --> 01:26:29,181
A little less.

1086
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:31,182
Less.

1087
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:38,524
A little less.

1088
01:26:41,127 --> 01:26:43,118
A little more.

1089
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:45,494
Little more, little more.

1090
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:47,226
Okay.

1091
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,234
<i>Hey, Stevie.</i>

1092
01:26:55,809 --> 01:26:58,333
A little more.

1093
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:00,470
A little less.

1094
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:03,710
A little less.

1095
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:05,717
Little less.

1096
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:15,993
Quarter pound of Swiss.

1097
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,164
A little less.

1098
01:27:23,036 --> 01:27:25,698
At last.

1099
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:29,730
<i>What's with the line? Let's pick things up.
All right? It's rush hour.</i>

1100
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,972
Come on, people.
Let's pick it up. Where's Katie?

1101
01:27:33,046 --> 01:27:34,340
<i>I'm here.</i>

1102
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:36,412
<i>Oh, you're here. You're
at your job. Great.</i>

1103
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:38,814
Have a nice day, lady.

1104
01:27:38,885 --> 01:27:43,322
<i>Go. Go, go, go.</i>

1105
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:47,323
Thirty-one.

1106
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:50,192
Thirty-one.
Yeah, can I get...

1107
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:53,028
- Do I know you from somewheres?
- No.

1108
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,728
You just look so damn familiar.

1109
01:27:55,801 --> 01:27:58,270
- <i>You Teamsters?</i>
- What are you having?

1110
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:01,698
Uh, can I get
a half-pound of Virginia ham...

1111
01:28:01,774 --> 01:28:04,835
- <i>half-pound of theJarlsberg?</i>
- Yeah.

1112
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:08,012
I know I know you from someplace.

1113
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:09,570
I don't know.

1114
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:12,311
- <i>You play softball?</i>
- Nah.

1115
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:15,650
<i>And you're not one
of Mikey Bosch's buddies, right?</i>

1116
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:17,882
Never heard of the guy.

1117
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:22,954
Wait a second.
Randy the Ram?

1118
01:28:24,331 --> 01:28:26,958
- No.
- The wrestler from the '80s?

1119
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:29,524
- Ram Jam?
- No.

1120
01:28:31,104 --> 01:28:33,095
<i>That's freaky.</i>

1121
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:35,470
- <i>You look just like the dude.</i>
- Yeah?

1122
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:37,475
Except older.

1123
01:28:42,448 --> 01:28:43,847
Ah!

1124
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:46,385
Ah! Ah! Goddamn it!

1125
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:48,250
Blood!

1126
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:50,085
<i>Randy... Randy, there are customers!</i>

1127
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:54,092
- You little prick! You gonna talk to me
the way you do? Huh?
- Randy!

1128
01:28:54,161 --> 01:28:55,992
I fucking quit!

1129
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:57,394
- I quit. All right?
- <i>What the fuck, man?</i>

1130
01:28:57,463 --> 01:28:59,091
Want some fucking cheese, lady?

1131
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:03,659
- Huh? Get your own fucking cheese!
- <i>Fucking lunatic!</i>

1132
01:29:04,604 --> 01:29:08,198
- Oh, fuck!
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

1133
01:29:08,274 --> 01:29:09,867
Ah, fuck! I quit!

1134
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:12,069
Goddamn it, I quit!

1135
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,078
God... I'm out of here!

1136
01:29:20,453 --> 01:29:22,921
Ah, shit.

1137
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:25,457
Ah, fuck.

1138
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:28,118
Oh, Robin.

1139
01:29:28,194 --> 01:29:33,097
Robin. Robin, man.
It's Randy. Randy.

1140
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,529
- Listen. I want to do it.
- You want to do what?

1141
01:29:35,601 --> 01:29:37,536
- I want back in. Fanfest.
- With Bob?

1142
01:29:37,604 --> 01:29:40,163
- Just tell him it's back on.
- I have no money to pay you.

1143
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:44,108
Hey, man, I don't give a shit.
I just wanna wrestle. That's right.

1144
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:46,645
