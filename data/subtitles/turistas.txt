1
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:21,780
Please.
You don't have to do this.

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,620
Oh, God!

3
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:28,184
Not like this.
No, you can't. Please!

4
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,527
No.

5
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,693
Please.

6
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,308
<i>Por favor!</i>

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,469
I am so sorry.

8
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,342
Oh, God, I wanna go home!

9
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,979
You having fun?

10
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,117
- Am I the only one having a problem with this?
- I guess they're used to it.

11
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:16,288
<i>I just keep thinking about
how far we must be from a hospital.</i>

12
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:19,492
<i>You know, with doctors who operate
instead of amputate?</i>

13
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,831
So dramatic.

14
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:28,470
- Would you slow the fuck down!
- Jesus Christ, relax! You're such a tourist.

15
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,045
<i>Por favor!</i>

16
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:34,912
<i>Calm down. He drives through it every day.
I think he knows how to drive better than you do.</i>

17
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:38,179
- He drives like a fucking lunatic.
- Well, we're fine, aren't we?

18
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:41,483
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

19
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,558
<i>- We're flying back.
- Okay, fine.</i>

20
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,559
- And I'm picking the hotels from now on.
- You were right about that.

21
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,595
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,535
Check it out.

23
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:02,610
- That looks painful.
- Stop it!

24
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,111
What do you think it says?

25
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,738
It says,
"Welcome to Brazil. Now bend over."

26
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,409
- We have to remember that.
- He likes you.

27
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,125
<i>Deus!</i>

28
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,998
<i>Jesus Christ! Stay on the road, you lunatic!</i>

29
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,307
Go out the window!
Go! Go!

30
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,906
<i>- Get out!
- Get out! Go, go, go!</i>

31
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,315
Get out right now!

32
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,617
Everybody out!

33
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,961
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Go!

34
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,361
Go! Get off!

35
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,194
<i>Jump! Get off!</i>

36
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:39,603
Oh, my God.
Get off! Get off, get off!

37
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,676
<i>Get off!</i>

38
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:01,055
<i>- Oh, shit!
- Did everyone get out of there?</i>

39
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,159
- You still think flying
would've been a waste of money?

40
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,828
- Don't start.
- I told you this was-

41
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,600
- Don't!
- Fine.

42
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,198
Why is my luggage
always the last to come out?

43
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,944
Ale-Alex? Found it!

44
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,950
Great!

45
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,984
I'm impressed.

46
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,681
- Why?
- Bit like bringing sand to the beach though.

47
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,191
Bringing a couple of fit little birds
like that to Brazil?

48
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:35,421
- That's my sister.
- Splendid.

49
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,828
Just like to know me options.

50
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,059
It's not an option.

51
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,329
- Get everything?
- Yeah, I think so.

52
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,667
- Hi, I'm Finn. Nice to meet you.
- Bea. You too.

53
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,333
- Liam.
- Hi. How are you guys?

54
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:49,603
Good as gold.
Hi. I'm Finn.

55
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:52,111
- Amy. Nice to meet you.
- Liam.

56
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,580
Guess we're bonded for life now, eh?
Near-death experience.

57
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,117
- Great story to tell the grandkids.
- Yeah.

58
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:01,279
- You think they got a plan to get us out of here?
- I doubt it.

59
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,357
- Should find out, I suppose.
- I'll find out.

60
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,926
Oh, man.

61
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:17,100
"Bussie!"
You suck at driving buses!

62
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,298
You should do something else.

63
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,170
Pick bananas or something.

64
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,301
- Hey.
- Hi.

65
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,312
- I'm Alex.
- Pru.

66
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:28,314
Yes. Yes.

67
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,214
- You're, um, supposed to kiss back.
- Ah. Sorry.

68
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,087
Except you don't actually kiss.
You sort of kiss the air.

69
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,919
- Yeah. Start again.
- I'm Alex.

70
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:39,585
- Pru. Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

71
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,662
- So, do you speak Spanish?
- It's Portuguese here.

72
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:45,130
- Right. So, any idea what
these guys are talking about?
- Another bus is on its way.

73
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,100
- It's gonna be about 10 hours.
- Ten hours?

74
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:50,797
- Yeah. And then it's another 18 to Recife.
- Wait, what did you just say?

75
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,805
<i>- About what?
- About where we're headed.</i>

76
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,899
Well, the way that guy was driving,
I'm not really sure.

77
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,671
- But you said Recife, right?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,145
- Which is north of Salvador.
- On most maps.

79
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,513
<i>- Which means we've been
headed north this whole time.
- Idiots, the pair of us.</i>

80
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,950
We got on the wrong fucking bus!

81
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,646
- The Rastafarian.
- I knew he was dodgy.

82
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,849
<i>- Brilliant cunts we are.
- Wait. Where did you guys think you were going?</i>

83
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,519
- To Floripa.
- Oh, you took the long way.

84
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,687
<i>- Yeah. Where was this bus headed?
- Belém.</i>

85
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:19,699
<i>Don't suppose that Belém is famous
for having a 10-to-1 ratio of women to men...</i>

86
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,735
where even the ugly girls
look like Giselle.

87
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,896
<i>And they're all smart, fun,
alcoholic nymphomaniacs...</i>

88
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,338
with a soft spot for charming
if slightly grubby foreign tourists?

89
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,910
Uh, not that I'm aware of, no.

90
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,911
- Too bad.
- 'Cause Floripa is.

91
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,380
<i>Six- Six Sports Illustrated
swimsuit models are from Floripa.</i>

92
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:38,816
<i>- Do you understand how select
that gene pool must be?
- It's a tiny town.</i>

93
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,225
- Leave it out.
- All right.

94
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,166
- Hey, are you getting anything?
- No. Nothing.

95
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,737
Do you think they know
something we don't?

96
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,776
I'm gonna walk around.

97
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,977
<i>Bonita.</i>

98
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:14,248
<i>Meu nome é Bea.</i>

99
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,823
Hey!

100
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:21,021
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

101
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,687
Photograph.
Photograph. It's a-

102
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,965
Hey, hey.

103
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:31,038
- Jesus! Calm down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

104
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,767
Calm down! I'm sorry!

105
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,106
- You're not to take pictures
of kids without permission.
- How am I supposed to know?

106
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,374
Hey. "No, senhorita"
would have been fine.

107
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,381
Or even "No, you stupid,
bloody gringo!"

108
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,815
Asshole! I can't hear ya!

109
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,480
Leave the girl alone. All right?

110
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,325
Prick.

111
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,327
Tabloids have been writing stories
about foreigners...

112
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,023
coming here to steal kids
to sell their organs for transplants.

113
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,156
It's created a lot of hostility
to tourists.

114
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,725
- Has that anything to do with
that couple that were missing?
- I don't think they're a couple.

115
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:05,670
- French couple, right?
- Oh, I thought you meant the kayakers.

116
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:09,903
Oi! We got no designs on your organs!
All right? Your kidneys are safe with us!

117
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,911
We're on holiday, for fuck's sake!

118
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:15,039
Hey, where'd you get those from?

119
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:24,352
- What did she say?
- She said there's a bar on the
beach and it's really close.

120
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,359
<i>- We can walk.
- Is there a town?</i>

121
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,988
<i>- Don't you think we should wait for the next bus?
- They haven't made the next bus.</i>

122
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,196
Let's go.
We'll come back later.

123
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,205
Let's do it.

124
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,540
So, how did you end up here?

125
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:47,046
I'm here with my little sister.

126
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,048
She's always wanted
to come to Brazil...

127
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,711
my mom didn't want her to go alone
and didn't trust her with Amy...

128
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,221
so I get to pretend to be the boyfriend
when creepy guys try to bother her.

129
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,225
What happens when
creepy girls bother you?

130
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,455
- So what about you? You traveling alone?
- Yeah.

131
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,726
- That's brave.
- Not really. I've been everywhere
they tell you not to go.

132
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,236
Colombia, Nigeria. Just spent
three months in a favela in Rocinha.

133
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:13,796
The only place I've ever had any problems
is in a small town in Australia.

134
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,468
- So, you're from Australia?
- Uh-huh.

135
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,477
Got a boyfriend in Australia?

136
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,480
No! You did not just say that!

137
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,380
- What?
- "So, you got a boyfriend in Australia?"

138
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:28,717
I just meant that if I had a girlfriend
or a little sister who was traveling alone...

139
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,723
I'd be a little worried, that's all.

140
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:33,794
Well, don't be.
I can take care of myself.

141
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:37,456
- So, did she say this was
a proper bar with real drinks?

142
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,795
I don't know.
She didn't say.

143
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,392
Christ, I'd do anything for a pint.

144
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:45,404
I'd lick the sweat
off a monkey's balls.

145
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:48,839
"I'd lick the sweat off a monkey's balls."

146
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,639
<i>- Christ on a cracker.
- This is amazing!</i>

147
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:55,182
<i>Oh, yes! Check this out!</i>

148
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:02,850
- Baby!
- Oh, yes!

149
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,323
Whoo! Who wants to go for a swim?

150
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:08,327
- Yeah, sure!
- Yes! This is what I was talking about.

151
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:11,125
<i>- They got beer?
- Get your kit off, girls!</i>

152
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,132
<i>Come on!
Let's swim!</i>

153
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,303
Shit.

154
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,863
I left my top in Rio.
Would you guys mind if I went topless?

155
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,536
<i>- Are you serious? No. Keep your shirt on.
- Yeah. Why not?</i>

156
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,614
Do you see what they're wearing, Alex?
We're not in America.

157
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:30,479
<i>No one's gonna care if I go topless.</i>

158
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:34,715
Yeah, but the idea is to tastefully reveal
as much as possible-

159
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,382
Oi, oi.
Get a load of that.

160
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,960
without actually
revealing so much...

161
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:43,292
that you can still get into heaven.

162
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,657
That was good.

163
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:49,635
Yes!

164
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:52,865
- That is a fantastic trick.
- Well, it's still a Catholic country.

165
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,306
- Well, we're Catholics.
- And we definitely don't mind.

166
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:00,608
<i>No. In fact, I think I can speak for Liam when
I say we wouldn't be offended in the slightest.</i>

167
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,479
<i>In fact, let's all go topless,
boys and girls.</i>

168
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,916
No, Amy-

169
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,921
<i>Oh! Nice!</i>

170
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,923
Put your shirt on.

171
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,754
She's a naughty girl.

172
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,886
<i>- How about that? Is this better?
- Oh, no!</i>

173
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,555
Come on.
Let's go.

174
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,724
All right, let's go get it wet.

175
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,736
<i>- Come on, Alex!
- Whoo!</i>

176
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,933
Let's get a drink.

177
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,435
<i>- Alex, where are you going?
- Over here.</i>

178
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,301
<i>Whoo!</i>

179
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,115
<i>- Qual é seu nome?
- É camila.</i>

180
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,208
Pru. Alex.

181
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,844
Nice to meet you.

182
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,685
- What do you want?
- Uh, Coke, please.

183
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,692
A Coke? You're 7,000 miles away
from home. Try something new.

184
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:21,694
- Like what?
- Have you ever had assai?

185
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,388
Uh, no.

186
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:26,466
It's, like, this amazing drink
from the Amazon. It's-

187
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,536
Just a Coke's fine.
Thank you. No ice.

188
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,969
My God, I love this country.

189
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:35,042
<i>It's like we died on the bus and this is heaven.</i>

190
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,303
<i>It's heaven.
It's, uh, paraíso.</i>

191
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,777
And you? Angel.

192
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,545
Wait.

193
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,551
You too!
Come on!

194
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,917
Ah!

195
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,921
<i>- Don't want to-
- Por favor?</i>

196
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:56,228
- No ice.
- No, no. It's, like, a hundred fucking degrees.

197
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,924
No, it's like ordering with dysentery
or without dysentery. No ice.

198
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,227
Dysentery.

199
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,768
This is unbelievable.

200
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:06,931
You think you've found
your own private Shangri-la.

201
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,477
Next thing you know, the place is crawling
with backpacking tourists wearing sandals.

202
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,876
Welcome to paradise.
I'm Svend.

203
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,777
- Pru, my sister Bea, Amy.
- Hi.

204
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,316
<i>- Where are you from?
- London.</i>

205
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,818
<i>- London. We're from Sweden.
- Sweden! Nice!</i>

206
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:25,382
We rode this beauty all the way from Mexico City
and stopped to have a drink three days ago.

207
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:27,893
<i>Now we can't
find any reason to leave.</i>

208
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,555
Yeah, and Brazilians
are the warmest and friendliest...

209
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:33,259
and most chill people
you're ever gonna meet.

210
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:37,963
<i>The drinks are cheap, and Camila's cooking,
it's unbelievable.</i>

211
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:41,906
And you even have a barrack you can sleep in
on the beach- only four bucks a night.

212
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,909
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Go on!</i>

213
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,911
About what?

214
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,846
Oh, no, no.
It's just an expression, like "no way."

215
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,886
<i>- Oh. Yeah!
- I hate living up to the natives' stereotype, but-</i>

216
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,547
and I think I speak for
my brother when I say this-

217
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,556
we're not leaving here...

218
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:01,059
- until either we run out of money-
- Or they run out of beer!

219
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,532
- Oh, my God.
- So, what do you think?

220
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,761
About getting on the bus?
Come on. Look where we are.

221
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,769
Well, how do we get back?

222
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:14,034
Hitchhike to a bigger town. We'll get on
a better bus, with air conditioning and brakes.

223
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,210
You in?

224
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,212
- Sure.
- Yeah! Let's do it!

225
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,975
All right, fuck the bus.

226
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,318
Yes!

227
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:32,552
Ow.

228
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,934
Camila.

229
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,243
<i>- Da. Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

230
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,257
Whoo! Let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

231
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,553
- Amy! Amy!
- Come on! In the middle!

232
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,060
Ohh! Nice!

233
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,927
Why won't someone pass me the ball?

234
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,569
<i>- Come on, come on!
- Think fast!</i>

235
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,730
<i>Oh!</i>

236
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,775
<i>We know how to play this game!</i>

237
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,777
- Ohh!
- You okay?

238
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,813
- You suck, Amy.
- Let's go!

239
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,314
You're on our side, Alex!

240
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,620
<i>Come on, Alex! Pass!</i>

241
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,952
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

242
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:44,122
<i>Come on, Liam! Run! Run!</i>

00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,131

<i>Go on. Dance with her.</i>

No, no, I'm not dancing.

293
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:04,255
No, no, no, it's not you. It's just that I have
these very European hips.

294
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,528
- They have to stay parallel to the floor at all times.
- Huh?

295
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,103
Apart from when I'm naked.

296
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,866
I can't do that.

297
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,134
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are you?

298
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,836
Go on!
Show her how it's done!

00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,065
I get a kiss just for
saying your name?

313
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,161
Arolea.

314
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,934

Mmm!

316
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,472
<i>This song is so nasty.</i>

317
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,474
What are they saying?

318
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,476
I'm not getting it all,
but basically...

319
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:00,479
it's a long list of explicit things
he likes to do in his car-

320
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,913
one being up the ass.

321
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,916
Mmm!

322
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:22,102
Do you wanna dance?

323
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,170
- Yes.
- Come on. Let's dance.

324
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:37,782
Oh, yes!

325
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,511
Oh, it's like that, is it? Oh!

326
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:45,353
- Yes. I want. Yeah. I like very much.
- Mmm.

327
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,460
Oh, God!

328
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,621
- Ah?
- Damn!

329
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,700
Yes. More.
All of it. All of it.

330
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:57,862
Oh! Yeah!
Take it all off. Yeah!

331
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,701
<i>- Mais?

332
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,708

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,142
<i>Mais! Mais!</i>

334
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,044
Oh, my God.

335
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:14,644
Oh, God bless Brazil.
Come on.

336
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,390
Yeah!

337
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,800
I love Brazil!

338
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:37,806
<i>God, you really are an angel.
Wanna come back with me to London?</i>

339
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,511
Oh, w-wait. No!
It's not like that!

340
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,608
<i>- É assim.
- But I thought you liked me. No?</i>

341
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,710
No.

342
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,734
Hey, Svend!
What a night!

343
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,243
Hey! Dude!

344
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,576
Bloody lightweight.

345
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,808
<i>Bea!</i>

346
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,810
<i>Bea, get up!</i>

347
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,073
Come on, get up. Get up.

348
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:23,149
Bea.
Come on, come on.

349
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:26,918
- You okay?
- What?

350
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,955
- You okay?
- No. I feel sick.

351
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,423
What happened?

352
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:34,391
They robbed us.

353
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:36,985
<i>- What?
- We got robbed.</i>

354
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,292
- By who?
- I don't know.

355
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,299
- What did they take?
- Everything.

356
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,335
- What do you mean, everything?
- I mean everything.

357
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,406
Our money, our credit cards,
our phones, our backpacks...

358
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,406
our passports, everything.

359
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,772
- Nana's ring.
- Yes, everything.

360
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,480
My earrings are gone.
How did they take my fucking earrings?

361
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:59,177
I think that they drugged us. They must have
put something in our drinks last night.

362
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,846
Mom is gonna kill me. She told me not to
bring the ring, 'cause-

363
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,014
Bea.

364
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:08,185
That is a very small problem right now.
We have no money. We have no way out of here.

365
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:11,094
We'll be fine.

366
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,029
<i>- You think so?
- Yeah.</i>

367
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,931
<i>'Cause I'm not so sure.
Come on.</i>

368
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:33,244
Mm-mmm.

369
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:36,907
Hold on.

370
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,195
Hey!

371
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,240
No! No! No! No!

372
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,605
No.

373
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,060
No.

374
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,067
What?
What did she say?

375
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,138
Oh, God. She's saying it's down here to the left.

376
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,140
The other guy said it's down here
to the right. So I have no idea.

377
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,642
Are you sure it's smart
going to the police?

378
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:47,645
- Aren't they supposed to be
worse than the criminals?
- Not all of them.

379
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:51,046
- Come on.
- Someone in this town
must know what's going on.

380
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,022
These kids are definitely in on it.
It's freaking me out.

381
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,865
- God.
- What did he say?

382
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:12,405
Let's, uh- Let's just try up here-
this little house or something.

383
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,247
- Are you sure we're going the right way?
- That's what he said.

384
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,317
I don't know.

385
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,696
Alex?
Where are you going?

386
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,196
Aah! Ow.

387
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,927
<i>- What is it?
- The Swede's motorcycle.</i>

388
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,738
Hello?

389
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,609
Olá!

390
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,041
<i>Olá!</i>

391
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:55,676
Hey! Hey!
Whose motorcycle is this?

392
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:58,273
Ask him who got-
Where'd they get this motorcycle?

393
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:04,414
That's Alex's hat.
That kid has Alex's hat.

394
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:07,084
- Alex!
- Alex, he's got your hat.

395
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,393
Grab him! Quick!

396
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,502
<i>- Wait up, Liam!
- Just wanna talk to you!</i>

397
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,400
<i>Where'd you get that hat?</i>

398
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:21,838
Come back here!

399
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,274
<i>Wait! Shit!</i>

400
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,680
<i>Oww! Aah!</i>

401
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,282
<i>- Where'd he go?
- Don't know.</i>

402
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,848
Aah!

403
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,762
Come back here!
Now!

404
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:49,524
You wait till I fucking catch you.

405
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,936
Now I've got you, you little shit.

406
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,846
Oh, shit.

407
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:10,256
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

408
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,192
What happened?
What'd you do?

409
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,200
<i>- It was an accident.
- You threw a rock at him?</i>

410
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,236
Didn't mean to hit his head.

411
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,862
- It was an accident.
- We got robbed!

412
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,464
He had our friend's cap!

413
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,476
It was an accident!

414
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:34,012
Hey! Don't touch me!

415
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,892
- Walk away.
- Let's just go. Let's just go.

416
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:52,089
Hey, come on. Just relax.
Just walk away.

417
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,099
Come on, come on, come on!

418
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:03,508
<i>- Are they following us?
- No, I don't think so.</i>

419
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,601
<i>W-We were robbed.
R-Roubado. Roubado.</i>

420
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,612
- I know.
- You know?

421
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,614
- Everybody knows.
- Who did it?

422
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,617
<i>Who did it?</i>

423
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,852
What police?

424
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:19,356
You crazy.
No police here. Okay?

425
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,360
<i>What do you mean, there's no police here?</i>

426
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:25,431
<i>- Christ, dude, where are you going?
- Stay here.</i>

427
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,536
Nice work.

428
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:34,038
<i>- Leave him alone.
- It was a fucking accident.</i>

429
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,404
- You don't throw a rock at a kid!
- Let it go!

430
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,444
<i>- Let it go!
- I'm sorry. Okay?</i>

431
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:42,242
<i>- Sorry, everybody.
- It's all right.</i>

432
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,429
Let's go, guys.

433
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,193
- Damn!
- Come on!

434
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:00,732
Come on!
Come on!

435
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:04,463
<i>- Okay, man! Hold up!
- Where are we going?</i>

436
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,563
- Is not good for you in town.
- Yeah, no kidding.

437
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:10,666
They are looking for the father
of this boy that you hurt.

438
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,677
<i>Is bad man.</i>

439
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,441
<i>They find him, is very bad for you.
Okay?</i>

440
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,448
Ask him where we're going, Pru.

441
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:24,188
There is-There is
a house of his uncle...

442
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,690
<i>and he says that it's very safe
for us there.</i>

443
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,194
No. We just want a ride.
Do you know anybody with a car?

444
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,165
No, no, no. No car.

445
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:38,294
There is-

446
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:41,168
<i>The only car is of the guy
that robbed us.</i>

447
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:44,368
<i>- You'd better wait for the bus.
- There's a bus? When is there a bus?</i>

448
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,638
<i>Uh, qu-quando- At what time?</i>

449
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,646
Uh... today?

450
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:50,875
<i>- Today there's a bus?
- Yes.</i>

451
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,647
- What time?
- Two day.

452
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,654
- Two days.
- Two days?

453
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:59,224
Why does everything take
so fucking long in this place?

454
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,294
<i>- Two day-
- Okay, vamos. Vamos la. Vamos.</i>

455
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:10,468
<i>Fuck! These insects are eating me alive.</i>

456
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,471
- Look at that. All over me legs.
- Leave it out.

457
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:16,872
There'd better be a big bag
of fucking weed at this house.

458
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:23,873
Kiko, can we just...
stop for a minute?

459
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:26,383
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

460
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,977
- Where are you going?
- The men's room.

461
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:05,149
Whose idea was it to leave the bus?

462
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:08,159
- Whose idea was it to come to Brazil?
- It was yours!

463
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:11,162
- I wanted to go to Bali.
- You're missing the point.

464
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:14,392
The point is, if we dig deep enough
I'm sure we'll discover this is all your fault.

465
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh, right. Yeah.

466
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,403
<i>- Which'll make me feel a lot better.
- Right.</i>

467
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,770
<i>And you know what? I did want to
come to Brazil. Why? Because I like girls.</i>

468
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,638
And I like beaches and drinking.

469
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,735
And when they say
"Come to Brazil," they say...

470
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:30,646
"Come to Brazil! We've got girls
and beaches and drinking!"

471
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,651
What they do not say,
what they completely neglect to mention...

472
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:37,120
is anything about being chased
into the jungle by an angry fuckin' mob...

473
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:40,124
<i>which is not my idea
of a fun vacation at all!</i>

474
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:42,660
<i>Oi, Kiko!
How far is this house?</i>

475
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:46,459
<i>- Uh, uh, como far?
- Hey, man, not so bad.</i>

476
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,160
What do you mean?
This is pretty fucking bad!

477
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,931
<i>What about a road?
Is there a road we can walk on?</i>

478
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:55,303
- No roads.
- What kind of house has no roads?

479
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,436
Fucking hell.

480
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:05,569
<i>Come on! Almost there!</i>

481
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,071
<i>Kiko! Where are we going?</i>

482
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:11,075
<i>There is a place where we can rest.</i>

483
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:13,145
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

484
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,747
Check it out!

485
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,749
<i>Come on! I show you something.</i>

486
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:21,820
<i>- Wow.
- This is my secret place.</i>

487
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,821
Kiko, can we swim here?

488
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,823
I show you some caves.

489
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,825
What caves? Where?

490
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,327
There are caves in the water.

491
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,330
We'll swim, then go to house.

492
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:35,629
- How close is the house?
- It's right on the river.

493
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,033
Ten minutes.

494
00:40:38,137 --> 00:40:40,571
<i>Hey, guys, watch me!</i>

495
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:43,540
You're joking. You're never gonna jump off of this!

496
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:46,271
- Kiko, It's too dangerous.
- Go ahead!

497
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,870
- Stop encouraging him!
- I am diving all the time!

498
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:51,472
Less talking!
More action!

499
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,575
No, stop!
Don't do it! No!

500
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:56,484
Kiko! Whoa!

501
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,218
<i>Crazy son of a bitch!</i>

502
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:05,024
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Come on!

503
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,691
<i>Come on, come on! Come down!</i>

504
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,360
Swim!
I show you caves!

505
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,234
<i>- No way I'm doing that!
- Come on. Let's go see 'em.</i>

506
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,671
<i>- I'm staying here.
- You sure?</i>

507
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,675
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

508
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:20,405
<i>- You can do it!
- Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, stay here too.</i>

509
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:22,811
Right.
Behave yourself.

510
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,988
Here?

511
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,285
- The caves! Come on!
- Over there?

512
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:35,292
I can't.
No, no, I can't.

513
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:37,089
Follow me.
It's an easy swim.

514
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:39,096
You can do it.

515
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:42,167
<i>- Come on. Let's do it.
- Okay.</i>

516
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:00,547
- Hey, Bea, you okay?
- Yeah.

517
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:04,555
- Is this it?
- Come on. A little more far.

518
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:13,254
<i>- Follow me.
- Kiko, where are we?</i>

519
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,266
Where are we goin'?

520
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,302
Fuck! That was a bat!

521
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:20,400
Kiko.

522
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:22,406
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

523
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:25,602
<i>- Kiko, what is this?
- We go under.</i>

524
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,508
- No!
- No. No.

525
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:29,513
- There-There is a hole.
- No, no, no, no.

526
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:32,049
Hey, man, it's easy.

527
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:34,676
This is incredible.
Incredible!

528
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:37,312
- All right. Let's go. Fine. Fine.
- No. No.

529
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:40,153
- One, two, three.
- What?

530
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:20,090
Asshole!
What the fuck is this?

531
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:23,794
Oh, Jesus!

532
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:26,804
That was not easy.
It was scary.

533
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:28,806
And this is not incredible.

534
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:30,808
We go more.
We go more.

535
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,810
Ow! Ow!
Jesus!

536
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:35,244
- Kiko!
- Fucking lunatic!

537
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:38,474
<i>- Kiko!
- Shit! The light!</i>

538
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,117
Holy shit!

539
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:19,191
<i>Wow, look at this place.
Bea, look at this.</i>

540
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,520
Wow, this is amazing. What is this place?

541
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:25,529
Very nice, Kiko!

542
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:28,031
<i>This water is so beautiful!</i>

543
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,567
<i>- This is incredible.
- Yes.</i>

544
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,114
<i>Is my secret place.</i>

545
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,352
I-I never making friends
with the gringos before.

546
00:44:57,463 --> 00:44:59,090
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

547
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:01,496
I never have, um, speak with one.

548
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,500
Really?

549
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:05,467
Well, hi there!

550
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:07,539
Oh, my God.

551
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,444
You okay?

552
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,104
What?

553
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:16,977
You-You feel okay?

554
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,779
- Yes, yes. I am okay.
- Okay.

555
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,816
Uh, maybe...

556
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:24,822
we go back to town.

557
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,653
<i>- What?
- Aqui. Yes.</i>

558
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:28,522
Is better we go back.

559
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:32,028
We just hiked 10 hours through the jungle.
How can you go back?

560
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:35,123
- Did you say go back?
- We're not going back. No way.

561
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:38,567
Yes.
I-I-I think is better.

562
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:42,129
- Why?
- Maybe I talk with these guys, okay?

563
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:45,039
Um, tell them you are okay.

564
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:47,305
Maybe find a ride for you.

565
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:49,847
But why are you saying this now?

566
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:53,680
- I don't know. It's just, um-
- It's just what?

567
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,686
No- No nothing.

568
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:59,383
<i>Look, it's simple- 10 hours hike through
the jungle, or 10 minutes to the house.</i>

569
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:02,256
I don't like hiking.
We go to the fucking house.

570
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:05,330
Is there a problem
with this house, Kiko?

571
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,989
No. No problem.

572
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,624
Then we go to the house.
Okay?

573
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:11,896
- Okay.
- Okay.

574
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:14,268
That's for almost killing us!

575
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,908
Come on, guys.
We walk back.

576
00:46:26,752 --> 00:46:30,188
- Oh. Hey. What's going on?
- Oi, oi!

577
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:33,452
Hi. How was it?

578
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:36,460
- Awesome. Underwater caves. It was cool.
- There were bats.

579
00:46:36,562 --> 00:46:38,462
Come on.
Let's go together.

580
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,794
Hey, Kiko, show me how you do that.

581
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,733
- I wanna do it. Show me. Yeah.
- Let's jump together.

582
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:46,270
One, two, three!

583
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:55,279
You guys should try it!

584
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,179
Dude, I wanna try.
Show me how you do it.

585
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:00,252
Okay, okay.
I go.

586
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:04,151
<i>Whoo! Crazy!</i>

587
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,756
<i>Whoo! Oh!</i>

588
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:14,732
<i>- Shit! He's bleeding!
- Kiko!</i>

589
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:16,734
- We're coming down!
- Stay up!

590
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:18,394
Jesus Christ!

591
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,338
<i>- What happened?
- He must have hit his head on a rock below.</i>

592
00:47:23,442 --> 00:47:25,410
Keep his head above the water!

593
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:28,309
Is he conscious?

594
00:47:28,414 --> 00:47:30,609
Oh, my God.

595
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:33,241
- Get him to the side.
- Come on, come on!

596
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,115
<i>- Swim! Swim!
- Over here!</i>

597
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:40,018
What are we gonna do?

598
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,025
Take him back to the village.

599
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,493
We'll never get back before dark.
We'll go to the house.

600
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,498
- We don't know where the house is!
- He said it was on the river.

601
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,262
Help me get him out. Grab my shirt.
We're gonna wrap his head.

602
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,139
<i>Is he gonna die?</i>

603
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:57,141
<i>- No.
- How do you know?</i>

604
00:47:57,243 --> 00:48:01,145
<i>Between rugby and bar fights, I've probably
had a concussion a year since I was nine.</i>

605
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:03,647
<i>- When did you play rugby?
- I played!</i>

606
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:06,183
- We should have just gone back to the village.
- No way!

607
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,253
They'll fucking kill us!

608
00:48:10,923 --> 00:48:13,323
What is this place doing here?

609
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:15,325
You okay?

610
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:17,895
He all right?

611
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,298
Hello!

612
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,595
Nearly there.

613
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:25,602
Whoa. This is crazy.

614
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:27,604
Almost there.

615
00:48:27,706 --> 00:48:29,674
Hello?

616
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:32,676
This guy likes his privacy.

617
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:36,009
- Hey, look, there's a dip there.
- Hello!

618
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:38,015
Oi!

619
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:41,018
Anyone home?

620
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,213
Bea, get a chair.

621
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:48,457
Here we go.

622
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,798
<i>Fuck!</i>

623
00:49:02,908 --> 00:49:05,741
- Oh, shit, that's deep.
- Jesus.

624
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:09,280
Keep pressure on that.
We need something to close this up.

625
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:12,748
Find, uh, superglue,
needle and thread, anything.

626
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:14,546
Check upstairs.

627
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:26,831
<i>Olá?</i>

628
00:49:37,776 --> 00:49:39,744
<i>Olá!</i>

629
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:15,680
<i>Olá?</i>

630
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:47,674
- Hold his head right here.
I gotta cut some of this out.
- Okay.

631
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,680
Oh. Sorry.

632
00:50:49,782 --> 00:50:52,512
- Hold his fucking head up!
- I got it. I got it!

633
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:58,155
Vicodin, codeine, Demerol made out to
every imaginable name and nationality-

634
00:50:58,257 --> 00:51:01,090
<i>- Gustav Roth, Marco Terelli-
- Hold him.</i>

635
00:51:01,193 --> 00:51:04,253
What the hell is this place, some kind of
youth hostel for drug addicts?

636
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:06,263
- Gotta hold this shut.
- I got it!

637
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:08,265
- A stapler?
- No, no, no. You can't use that.

638
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,335
- It's fine.
- No!

639
00:51:10,436 --> 00:51:12,870
It's what they used on me when I split
me head open. Hold it closed.

640
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:14,598
- Hold it shut.
- You got it.

641
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:16,230
- Oh, Jesus.
- More.

642
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:17,706
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

643
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,074
- Sorry, mate.
- Hold him.

644
00:51:22,781 --> 00:51:25,443
- Okay?
- I got him. I got him.

645
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,183
<i>Kiko, where you going? Are you okay?</i>

646
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,919
<i>- Kiko.
- Kiko, you okay?</i>

647
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:42,562
<i>Kiko.</i>

648
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:44,761
Should we keep him awake?

649
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,770
I don't know.

650
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:49,238
He could have a concussion.

651
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,381
Clothes.

652
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:05,722
Mmm.
Smoked herring.

653
00:52:07,826 --> 00:52:09,885
Let's see.
Mushrooms and cheese.

654
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:12,395
That's good.

655
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,434
Hey. Look. Look what I got.

656
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:19,436
Oh, you want some, don't you?

657
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:21,938
You want some.
Come here. Up here.

658
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,008
Yeah.

659
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,440
Nasty.
Here you go.

660
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,243
Ohh.

661
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:34,982
Yeah!

662
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,728
Hey.

663
00:52:45,964 --> 00:52:49,229
- Anything good?
- I think our luck might be turning.

664
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:52,792
- Oh, yeah?
- Twenty-year-old single malt.

665
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,978
What the hell is this?

666
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:12,089
Who the hell are these people?

667
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:21,993
Hmm.

668
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,398
Thank you.

669
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,151
This house is so fucking creepy.

670
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,153
We'll just stay the night.

671
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:53,156
Then Kiko will show us the way out
in the morning.

672
00:54:53,258 --> 00:54:56,659
- If he dies, how do we get back?
- He's not gonna die.

673
00:54:56,762 --> 00:54:59,663
'Cause I don't wanna be here
if his uncle shows up and we're like...

674
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:02,666
"Hello, mate. Here's your dead nephew.
And you're out of scotch."

675
00:55:06,772 --> 00:55:09,673
And why is there no road?
What kind of fucking hermit lives-

676
00:55:09,775 --> 00:55:12,903
- Oi!
- Yeah, I know. Leave it out.

677
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:18,048
So, how does this rank
with your other trips?

678
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,051
After the last few days,
right at the bottom. You?

679
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:24,953
- Well, we had a pretty tough time in Cambodia.
- At least we had that hash.

680
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:27,025
Yeah, and those Dutch girls.

681
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:30,695
I just want to go home.

682
00:57:35,754 --> 00:57:37,722
His uncle.

683
00:57:46,998 --> 00:57:48,898
What's going on?

684
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,627
I'm not sure.

685
00:58:08,186 --> 00:58:10,313
What is he saying?

686
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:25,360
<i>Alex.</i>

687
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:30,969
Kiko, what's-

688
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:32,976
<i>Olá.</i>

689
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,487
Hi.

690
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,487
Hi.

691
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,716
- You guys American?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:49,225
Cool. I've been one time
to New York.

693
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:51,352
Hmm.

694
00:58:54,499 --> 00:58:56,592
Go. Run.

695
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,726
- What do you mean?
- Run right now.

696
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:02,136
This guy has plans for you
and your friends...

697
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,141
and his plans are pretty fucking elaborate
and pretty fucking fucked.

698
00:59:05,243 --> 00:59:07,370
<i>So if I were you, I'd just run.</i>

699
00:59:19,324 --> 00:59:22,816
Look, we didn't-
We're friends of Kiko.

700
00:59:22,928 --> 00:59:25,226
He said- Hey! Shit!

701
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,094
No.

702
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:49,786
Kiko. Kiko!
Where the fuck did you take us?

703
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:52,686
Tell him we're your friends.
Where the fuck are you going?

704
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,191
<i>- Kiko!
- Tell him we're your friends!</i>

705
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:57,386
<i>Where are you going?</i>

706
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:59,690
- Alex, help me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

707
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:03,393
- Get your fucking hands off me!
What's the matter with you?

708
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:05,401
Back off!

709
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,903
Oh, God!

710
01:01:00,892 --> 01:01:04,692
<i>Don't take this personal, okay?</i>

711
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:10,267
If it makes you feel any better...

712
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:13,201
please know that I'm doing this...

713
01:01:13,304 --> 01:01:16,000
<i>for a good cause.</i>

714
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:19,270
Please, don't.

715
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:21,345
Did you know that in America...

716
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:24,745
there is a seven-year wait...

717
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,113
for a healthy kidney?

718
01:01:29,454 --> 01:01:31,081
And in Europe...

719
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,086
it's worse.

720
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,027
So...

721
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:41,189
if a rich gringo needs a kidney...

722
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:43,267
what does he do?

723
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:46,929
Wait and get sick and die
like the rest of us?

724
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,199
- Don't. Please.
- No.

725
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:53,234
He comes here to Brazil...

726
01:01:53,344 --> 01:01:55,642
to take advantage of our bounty...

727
01:01:55,747 --> 01:01:59,979
and of our poverty.

728
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:03,486
<i>The whole history of our country...</i>

729
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:06,250
is you taking from us...

730
01:02:06,357 --> 01:02:08,518
and our land-

731
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:11,495
rubber, sugar, gold.

732
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:18,095
And from our bodies-
for slaves, for sex.

733
01:02:18,203 --> 01:02:23,163
And now, for- for our insides.

734
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:32,144
<i>But I...</i>

735
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,616
have had...

736
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,347
enough.

737
01:03:28,439 --> 01:03:30,737
Bea! Bea!

738
01:03:31,776 --> 01:03:34,677
Take the knife!
Take it!

739
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:37,145
Take the knife.
Cut this rope off.

740
01:03:37,248 --> 01:03:39,216
Cut this off my hands.

741
01:03:50,628 --> 01:03:52,289
Cut.

742
01:03:58,102 --> 01:04:00,730
<i>Hurry.
Bea, hurry!</i>

743
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,570
<i>Attagirl. Attagirl.</i>

744
01:04:05,476 --> 01:04:07,205
Cut- Cut it.

745
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:11,812
Hurry!

746
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:24,057
It sickens my heart,
this combination-

747
01:04:24,162 --> 01:04:26,756
- your greed-
- Oh, God, no.

748
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:29,425
and our weakness.

749
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:34,271
And so I am thinking:

750
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:39,810
Maybe there is something
I can do to even the scales just a little-

751
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,007
to help you find a way...

752
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:46,083
to give back.

753
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:21,485
Today I am to take
the organs of all of you...

754
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:24,384
and give them...

755
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:26,787
to the People's Hospital in Rio.

756
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:31,653
Counting down from right now,
I have-

757
01:05:31,763 --> 01:05:34,129
I have about 12 hours...

758
01:05:34,232 --> 01:05:37,963
to get your liver
and your kidneys...

759
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:40,060
and the liver and kidneys...

760
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:42,162
<i>of all your fucking amiguinhos...</i>

761
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:46,175
into that helicopter
and back to the city.

762
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:51,214
I'd take your hearts too,
your corneas-

763
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:54,376
even the skin from your lily-white asses.

764
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:56,578
But they don't travel too well.

765
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:04,791
You can only keep a heart
outside a body for six hours.

766
01:06:06,597 --> 01:06:08,724
But I want that.

767
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,026
I want a heart-

768
01:06:13,237 --> 01:06:16,570
a heart of some
arrogant fucking gringo tourist...

769
01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:18,665
pumping life back into the veins...

770
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:21,074
<i>of a little Brasileiro.</i>

771
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:27,443
But that's gonna take more planning.

772
01:06:45,536 --> 01:06:47,936
Your turn.

773
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:23,166
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, come on!

774
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:25,235
<i>Kiko, grab the key!</i>

775
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:29,763
Go, go!

776
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:33,275
- Come on, come on!
- Oh, oh!

777
01:08:40,518 --> 01:08:42,577
Hurry up!

778
01:08:44,889 --> 01:08:48,416
Come on, come on!

779
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:54,360
- Come on. Go to the waterfall.
We'll meet you there.
- No!

780
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:56,592
- Alex!
- Take her to the waterfall! Go!

781
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:58,760
- Alex, no!
- Come on. Let's get him out.

782
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:11,181
Please. Please, don't.

783
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:15,418
<i>Please. Please.</i>

784
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:25,628
Please don't. Please.

785
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:29,222
No. No.

786
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,426
No, please don't.

787
01:09:31,536 --> 01:09:33,970
<i>No, please!
Please, don't!</i>

788
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:57,359
Shut up, you-

789
01:09:57,461 --> 01:10:00,624
Come on!

790
01:10:00,731 --> 01:10:02,995
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

791
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:08,096
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go, man! Go!

792
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:10,640
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not leaving Finn.

793
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:12,868
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Don't be stupid!

794
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:14,945
What the fuck is that?
Yo, go, man!

795
01:10:15,046 --> 01:10:17,571
- Get the fuck away from me, Kiko!
- Ow!

796
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:24,407
Shh. Stay back.

797
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:57,578
<i>Jesus, please!
Come on now. Go! Go, go!</i>

798
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:09,985
Oh, fuck.

799
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:12,494
Come on. I'm gonna get you
out of here, bro.

800
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:15,394
You'll be all right, okay?

801
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:17,626
Help me get him out.

802
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:50,859
Fuck! Hurry up! Hurry up!

803
01:12:50,968 --> 01:12:53,198
Come on! Come on!

804
01:12:57,475 --> 01:13:00,308
Quick, quick!

805
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:12,645
Shh.

806
01:14:05,776 --> 01:14:08,267
<i>Shh. Keep quiet.</i>

807
01:14:08,379 --> 01:14:10,711
<i>Shh!</i>

808
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:28,958
Let's go. All right,
go, go, go, man, go!

809
01:14:33,471 --> 01:14:37,100
Go! Go! Run! Run!

810
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:45,909
Hey!

811
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:50,248
Oh, my God. Come on! He's dead!
Let's go! Let's go!

812
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:52,788
Jesus! Come on!

813
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:56,758
<i>You're crazy! You're crazy!
You stupid son of a bitch! What are you doin'?</i>

814
01:14:56,861 --> 01:14:59,261
Fuck you!

815
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:25,376
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Alex! Alex!

816
01:16:25,482 --> 01:16:27,848
Hi.

817
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:32,845
Hi.

818
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:39,127
- Amy-Amy's-
- No, no, she's gone.

819
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:41,197
I'm sorry.

820
01:16:41,298 --> 01:16:43,562
Hey, man.

821
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:47,733
It's danger. Danger, okay?
Let's go.

822
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,999
All right.
Come on, Bea. Up, up.

823
01:16:50,107 --> 01:16:54,009
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

824
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:16,561
Hurry, Bea.
Come on, come on!

825
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,278
Hey, guys, come on!

826
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:52,659
You okay?

827
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:55,102
I've been here most of the night.

828
01:17:55,205 --> 01:17:57,173
What about the others?

829
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:01,975
They're gone.
Come on. We gotta go.

830
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:04,775
<i>Be quiet! Silence!</i>

831
01:19:07,478 --> 01:19:11,073
- Stop it!
- You crazy, man!

832
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,344
This is all your fault! You brought us here!
You knew this was gonna happen!

833
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:16,681
- He's risking his life!
- Fuck that!

834
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,821
Go, go, go! Get down! Dive!

835
01:19:26,797 --> 01:19:29,823
Come with me.

836
01:20:21,552 --> 01:20:24,646
- You okay?
- What are we gonna do?

837
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:27,781
We gotta find a way out of here.

838
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:39,262
- There's someone coming.
- What? Who?

839
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:42,236
<i>I'll find another way out.
Follow me.</i>

840
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:20,844
Turn off your light.

841
01:21:25,883 --> 01:21:28,681
- He's coming! Let's go!
- No, I can't! I can't go!

842
01:21:28,785 --> 01:21:31,117
Bea, you have to!
Come on!

843
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:37,012
- Where's Bea?
- I don't know.

844
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,020
Bea.

845
01:24:12,249 --> 01:24:14,683
Bea!

846
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:17,669
Bea!

847
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:20,750
<i>Bea!</i>

848
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:26,383
You okay?

849
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,458
Never leave me again.

850
01:25:30,727 --> 01:25:33,924
<i>Over here. Just take my hand. Come on.</i>

851
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,328
There's land.
We can get out here.

852
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:39,994
- There's an airway up here.
- That's great.

853
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:42,901
This might be the way out.

854
01:25:46,877 --> 01:25:49,311
<i>Let me see it.</i>

855
01:25:49,412 --> 01:25:51,744
It's fine.
Here, hold this.

856
01:25:56,386 --> 01:25:59,321
It's fine. It's fine.
Let's just find our way out of here.

857
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:02,152
- We should just keep heading up.
- All right.

858
01:26:02,259 --> 01:26:04,420
Let's go.

859
01:26:07,864 --> 01:26:11,061
Alex, get down.

860
01:26:12,202 --> 01:26:14,329
Turn off your light.

861
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:38,918
<i>Shh, shh, shh. Don't fucking move.</i>

862
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:55,341
Hey.

863
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:31,578
<i>Alex! Alex, what are you doing?
Get off him!</i>

864
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:34,741
Stop do-Alex!
What are you doing?

865
01:27:35,952 --> 01:27:38,546
Oh! Oh, God.

866
01:27:38,655 --> 01:27:41,249
Oh, my God.

867
01:27:55,639 --> 01:27:57,402
What?

868
01:30:11,207 --> 01:30:15,200
<i>- This is stupid.
Why don't we just take the bus?
- The bus.</i>

869
01:30:15,311 --> 01:30:18,303
- We could take the bus.
Then we could see the country.
- The bus takes forever.

870
01:30:18,415 --> 01:30:22,511
- I thought that's why we came
here, to experience new things.
- Yeah, I guess.

871
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:24,849
- Take the plane.
- What?

872
01:30:24,954 --> 01:30:27,115
Take the plane.

873
01:30:27,223 --> 01:30:30,021
<i>- Thanks, man.
- De nada.</i>
