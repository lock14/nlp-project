1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,335
600 years before Columbus...

2
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:47,213
...North America was invaded by ruthless
marauders intent on settling its shores.

3
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:51,676
Something stopped them.

4
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:56,305
What follows is the legend.

5
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:12,155
We are the People of the Dawn.

6
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:16,410
This land has been our home
for countless generations.

7
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:21,915
There's a prophecy that tells
of a creature, swift of foot...

8
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:24,501
...white as snow.

9
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:31,342
When he is seen,
change follows like a storm.

10
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,698
He can't stay with us.

11
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:19,203
His skin... His eyes...

12
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:22,832
Like some kind of evil spirit
that has never seen the sun.

13
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,500
A demon.

14
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,752
He is not a demon.

15
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,546
He is a boy.

16
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,673
Blood runs true.

17
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,552
He will turn into a monster.
Like his fathers.

18
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:56,450
If we put this child
in the cold to die...

19
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:59,661
...who will be the monsters then?

20
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:02,706
She speaks the truth.

21
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,792
The boy...

22
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,421
...has destiny among the People.

23
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,594
He stays.

24
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,409
Who are you, little one?

25
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:28,003
Little savage.

26
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,469
Kill this vermin!

27
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:54,155
You are no son of mine!

28
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,964
15 years later

29
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,524
Let me help you.

30
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:04,081
Ghost.

31
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,876
Come on, let's go!

32
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:09,337
Come on! Over here!

33
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,807
I see the young ones.

34
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,939
Welcome.
Your journey has ended.

35
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,233
You've come early
for the spring trade.

36
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,904
Since when does the Pathfinder
come on a trading trip?

37
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,534
I come for more than trade.

38
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,624
Give it to me. Give it to me.

39
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,940
Look, it's the Quiet One.

40
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,692
Play for us.

41
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,903
It's mine!

42
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,868
I'm gonna get it.

43
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:38,930
She's beautiful. Isn't she?

44
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:53,695
There was an avalanche
during the winter hunt.

45
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,280
How many dead?

46
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,533
Three of the four hunting parties.

47
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:02,496
Among them
he who was to take my place.

48
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:06,250
Have you chosen another?

49
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,628
It will be one of them.

50
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,922
But which one?

51
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,551
I do not know yet.

52
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:23,059
Your daughter has become
a woman, Pathfinder.

53
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,978
And we are turning into old men.

54
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:29,023
You've been old men for some time.

55
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:39,284
Tonight we celebrate
the circle of the braves.

56
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:42,913
Perhaps you can lead the ritual?

57
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,257
What do you see?

58
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,848
The prophecy...

59
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,434
...is coming to fulfillment.

60
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:31,838
The People of the Dawn
have always had a Pathfinder.

61
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,218
Our tradition obliges the people...

62
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:39,304
...to choose a successor.

63
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,864
Daughter...

64
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:00,159
...he has yet to earn
the right to be here.

65
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:05,832
You are still haunted
by the demons from your past.

66
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:08,001
Until you face them...

67
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,172
...you will never know
who you really are.

68
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,566
Then I will find my own path.

69
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,285
Son.

70
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:36,801
If I cannot be a brave...

71
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,016
...then who am I?

72
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:48,480
You were born to the Dragon Men,
but you are ours.

73
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,588
Farewell.

74
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,152
Farewell. See you next year.

75
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,572
Look what I got. It's a flute.

76
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,785
You got a flute.

77
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:24,121
- Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, Father.

78
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,248
I won't be gone long.

79
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,876
Oh, so pretty.

80
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,712
Goodbye, Mother.

81
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,592
- Be safe, my boy.
- Hey, Ghost!

82
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:40,262
No, go.

83
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,556
Come on.

84
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,648
Farewell, my son.

85
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,573
Don't go too far by yourself.

86
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,659
How come you're always so serious?

87
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,912
I'm here to look after you.

88
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,748
Will you take care of my doll too?

89
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,919
Both of you, I promise.

90
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,923
Go with her.

91
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,537
No!

92
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:45,955
Quickly, gather them up!

93
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,790
Run! Run!

94
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:27,998
No! No!

95
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:42,388
No!

96
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,499
Mother.

97
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,253
Wait!

98
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:01,386
Show some respect for our host.

99
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,565
Even though they are savages...

100
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:16,318
...they should be treated with honor.

101
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:26,746
Death by the blade!

102
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,334
Father!

103
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,189
This one looks different.

104
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:00,781
Maybe this one can use a sword.

105
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,310
Take it away before he hurts himself.

106
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:47,955
Bring me his head!

107
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,194
This savage knows our ways.

108
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,103
Where is his head?

109
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:54,480
I lost him.

110
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,113
Damn you!

111
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:19,631
He'll lead us to the next village.

112
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:28,515
I want to kill them all.

113
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:34,939
Good. Wipe them out and cleanse
this land before we settle here.

114
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:49,349
- It was over there.
- I heard it too.

115
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:22,926
Father, those tracks.

116
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:27,367
Get away.

117
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:45,720
He's bleeding.

118
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:29,014
Father!

119
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:53,915
He is close.

120
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,190
He must sleep.

121
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:28,576
And so must I.

122
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,447
What is it you dream of?

123
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:27,929
- We should not have taken him in.
- My fear is that he is dangerous.

124
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:30,890
Our friend is not to be feared.

125
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:34,143
This bears the mark
of the Dragon People.

126
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:38,440
It is they who hunt him.

127
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:41,818
- What if they come here?
- They will kill you all.

128
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:45,322
Down to the last man,
woman, and child.

129
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,910
They may let one of you escape
so they can follow you to the next village.

130
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:53,997
But they will cut out your tongue first
so you can warn no one.

131
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,874
I've seen them do it.

132
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,210
What about your village?

133
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,798
They're dead.

134
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:07,720
They will follow your trail here.

135
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,430
I told you to leave me.

136
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,851
You should have listened.

137
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,646
Then we will stand and fight.

138
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:29,576
They all carry these weapons.

139
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:34,164
And they're covered in a skin
that arrows of stone cannot pierce.

140
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,832
Run and you may live.

141
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,004
Fight them...

142
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:04,112
Search the cave!

143
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,547
You two must lead our people
to the bay.

144
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:25,133
Head west through the mountains.

145
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:30,305
When you reach the mark at the fork,
follow the trail east.

146
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:32,558
Spring has come early...

147
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:34,977
...and the west trail is not safe.

148
00:45:35,144 --> 00:45:37,438
There is a danger of avalanche.

149
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,524
We've lost enough lives.

150
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:45,488
Go, go.

151
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,281
We go.

152
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:54,914
What will you do?

153
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:58,168
Kill as many as I can.

154
00:45:58,752 --> 00:46:00,629
And after?

155
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:03,340
There'll be no after.

156
00:46:10,806 --> 00:46:12,307
Father...

157
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:14,810
...you can't just let him go.

158
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:17,104
He must find his own way.

159
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:20,774
His heart is full of vengeance.

160
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:25,946
- Carry all that you can.
- He knows what is best.

161
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,461
Go! Go back!

162
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:57,020
Go! Go with the others.

163
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:19,335
Keep moving forward. Keep moving.

164
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:20,753
Come on, hurry.

165
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,338
Move, move! Come on!

166
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:24,173
- Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

167
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:26,426
- Come on.
- My doll!

168
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:28,782
This is the canyon
where all paths converge.

169
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:43,422
Yeah.

170
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:46,926
We'll greet them here.

171
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:27,176
The Pathfinder's daughter is not here.

172
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,806
She is gone.

173
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,476
The Pathfinder told us
to stay together...

174
00:49:35,643 --> 00:49:38,938
- ...to get to the bay.
- So we can hide like mice.

175
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:46,654
I will find her.

176
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,031
Bring her back.

177
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:50,700
And the Dragon leader's head.

178
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:54,371
You're not going
because of the Dragon People.

179
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,666
You're going because she went back
to him.

180
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:09,094
We'll go east
as the Pathfinder said.

181
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:12,285
The ashes are still warm.

182
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:15,371
They are close!

183
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:16,956
Put the torches out.

184
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:53,828
- Twig.
- Spear.

185
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,960
What are you doing here?

186
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:07,592
That is a question
you must ask yourself.

187
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:12,055
You speak in riddles, old man,
just say what you mean.

188
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:17,644
There is a decision before you.
Trust what I tell you.

189
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:25,402
I trust in this.

190
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:31,992
A sword...

191
00:52:33,702 --> 00:52:35,538
...can cut two ways.

192
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,793
My father says
you are full of vengeance.

193
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:35,099
You cannot be here.

194
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:41,356
There are two wolves
fighting in every man's heart.

195
00:53:42,274 --> 00:53:44,359
One is love.

196
00:53:45,152 --> 00:53:47,237
The other is hate.

197
00:53:49,656 --> 00:53:52,326
Which one wins?

198
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:55,078
The one you feed the most.

199
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,468
Who are they?

200
00:54:50,427 --> 00:54:52,304
Why did they come here?

201
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:55,141
They're beasts.

202
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:59,520
They live for slaughter, plunder.

203
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:03,691
They live and die
by the sword.

204
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,532
It is in their blood.

205
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:17,831
Is it in your blood?

206
00:55:33,555 --> 00:55:35,391
They're coming.

207
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:48,841
Now!

208
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:37,975
We'll meet back in the cave.

209
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:55,827
Wait. Not yet.

210
01:00:24,483 --> 01:00:26,110
No!

211
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:32,053
Look!

212
01:01:33,847 --> 01:01:35,598
Go get him!

213
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:54,701
- Come on.
- No.

214
01:01:56,078 --> 01:02:01,041
Find her. Protect her.
This is my journey.

215
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,628
And it lies upon a different path.

216
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,562
Go on. Go on!

217
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:15,160
I can't see anything.

218
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:42,186
Son of a whore isn't here!

219
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,660
This will make him come out.

220
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:25,023
No. No.

221
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:40,997
Have you had enough
of your vengeance yet?

222
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:26,899
Tell me where the next village is.

223
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:45,752
Take him!

224
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:04,813
She came back and changed
what I could not.

225
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:12,655
If you are not strong enough
to kill the bear...

226
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:15,658
...use the bear's strength to kill it.

227
01:11:18,702 --> 01:11:21,163
Take my path...

228
01:11:22,248 --> 01:11:24,500
...and I will take yours.

229
01:11:33,009 --> 01:11:35,094
Tell me!

230
01:11:57,117 --> 01:11:58,452
Rip him apart!

231
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:34,740
Now will you tell me
where the villagers are?

232
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:46,585
Many years ago a ship came here.

233
01:12:46,752 --> 01:12:48,504
On board was a boy...

234
01:12:51,674 --> 01:12:55,177
...the son of a great Viking warrior.

235
01:12:57,763 --> 01:13:00,433
I knew your father.

236
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:19,494
Where are they?

237
01:13:39,306 --> 01:13:40,933
Wait!

238
01:13:42,476 --> 01:13:44,562
I will take you there.

239
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:47,565
I will be your pathfinder...

240
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:50,526
...if you let her live.

241
01:13:59,661 --> 01:14:03,623
I knew you could speak like a human.

242
01:14:09,796 --> 01:14:13,300
Gunnar! An eye for an eye!

243
01:15:14,405 --> 01:15:17,366
I decide who dies.

244
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:40,015
I remember the home of the Dragon Men,
the endless winter.

245
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:43,519
They know snow and ice
like no other living men.

246
01:15:45,896 --> 01:15:48,691
But they know nothing of our spring.

247
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:24,686
Where have they gone?

248
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:26,730
Wait! Wait!

249
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:31,985
Over the mountains.

250
01:16:34,947 --> 01:16:37,074
I know where they went.

251
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,828
Then lead on.

252
01:16:50,129 --> 01:16:51,255
Over here!

253
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:07,981
Let's go.

254
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:33,883
They'll find the others.
What are you doing?

255
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,761
What your father taught me.

256
01:18:18,763 --> 01:18:22,225
Get up, you clumsy bitch!

257
01:18:25,395 --> 01:18:27,188
We go west.

258
01:18:28,773 --> 01:18:31,901
That leads us away from the coast!

259
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,908
Do you think me a fool, boy?

260
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:41,995
I'm telling the truth.

261
01:18:43,622 --> 01:18:47,000
Bring the bitch.

262
01:18:52,339 --> 01:18:55,009
Over here!

263
01:19:03,601 --> 01:19:05,519
Move!

264
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,464
We should go around the ice.

265
01:19:32,965 --> 01:19:36,343
- He's trying to slow us down.
- No.

266
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,888
It's safer to go around the lake.

267
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:42,975
We are not cowards!

268
01:22:12,964 --> 01:22:18,386
So you have become the Pathfinder
for the Dragon People. Good.

269
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:26,102
I'm dying.

270
01:22:28,688 --> 01:22:30,941
Don't complain to me about it.

271
01:22:31,441 --> 01:22:33,402
Anyway, you can't die yet.

272
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,033
You're not done.

273
01:22:41,034 --> 01:22:46,248
- This is for the next Pathfinder.
- Who?

274
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:49,919
You already know.

275
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:22,327
Get him out!

276
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:30,711
- Let him die!
- It was your idea to cross the ice...

277
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:32,838
...and we still need him.

278
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:44,851
Is it cold, you bastard?

279
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:50,106
We'll go around the lake.

280
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:38,197
The lost hunting party.

281
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:39,052
Let's tie ourselves together.

282
01:25:40,554 --> 01:25:43,181
The path is too dangerous.

283
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:48,812
Then you lead the way.

284
01:26:34,234 --> 01:26:36,236
Tie yourselves together!

285
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,796
She stays tied to me.

286
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:30,292
He's leading us nowhere!

287
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:44,349
I want you to hit me.

288
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:48,019
- What?
- Hit me.

289
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:53,567
Hit me.

290
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:02,868
Enough, bitch!

291
01:28:06,997 --> 01:28:09,959
You are the son of a Viking. Show it!

292
01:28:11,377 --> 01:28:13,462
Show it!

293
01:30:35,651 --> 01:30:37,194
Here!

294
01:30:53,878 --> 01:30:56,381
Come to me.

295
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:41,532
Listen to me!

296
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:43,742
Leave!

297
01:32:43,909 --> 01:32:47,913
No! No, I'm not going
to leave you! No.

298
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,001
Go! Trust me! Please!

299
01:33:24,076 --> 01:33:26,328
Go!

300
01:33:39,675 --> 01:33:44,639
You chose savages
over your own kind.

301
01:33:44,805 --> 01:33:48,726
Die, crying boy...

302
01:33:50,228 --> 01:33:56,192
...because you could not remember
who you are!

303
01:34:02,866 --> 01:34:07,120
I know who I am!

304
01:34:21,218 --> 01:34:26,932
I know who I am!

305
01:36:24,471 --> 01:36:25,597
Do it!

306
01:36:26,598 --> 01:36:29,393
Give me death by the sword.

307
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:38,110
I am the last of your kind
in this cursed land.

308
01:36:44,492 --> 01:36:46,327
You're not my kind.

309
01:38:20,216 --> 01:38:22,009
They're gone.

310
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,730
The spirit of the prophecy...

311
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:36,899
...has come full circle.

312
01:41:40,131 --> 01:41:42,175
Like my father before me...

313
01:41:42,342 --> 01:41:45,762
...I became the Pathfinder
to the People of the Dawn.

314
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:56,857
He watched over the coast,
always over the coast...

315
01:41:57,024 --> 01:41:59,526
...looking for signs
of the Dragon Men...

316
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:02,696
...to keep the wolves of hate
away from our shores.

317
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,117
He had found his path.

318
01:42:06,283 --> 01:42:10,705
Of two peoples,
he was neither, yet he was both.

319
01:42:19,964 --> 01:42:22,133
He changed my life...

320
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,553
...and the destiny of our people.
