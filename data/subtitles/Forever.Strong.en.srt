1
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,483
Way to go, Rick!

2
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,816
Get in there!

3
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,258
Go with him! Go with him!

4
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,911
Yeah, nice! Way to hustle!
Good job. Good job.

5
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,020
Highland Rugby, One, Two

6
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,210
One, Two!

7
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,337
Beniamin, Adam,
off the field, now!

8
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,943
- Way to stick with it.
- How did you miss that?!

9
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:01,549
What are you guys doing?
Get it together!

10
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,321
Okay, Roundy.
Let's go! Let's go!

11
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,405
Hustle, hustle!

12
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:08,011
Get back in there.

13
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,679
Let's go!

14
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,015
A little rough on his kid, huh?

15
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,251
- What the heck was that, huh?
- Go!

16
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,608
That's rugby, man.

17
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,484
- What?
- You...

18
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,715
- Oh, no!
- He spit in his face.

19
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,487
Let's go!

20
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,738
Come on, guys, let's go!

21
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,657
- Oh, no way, man! Come on!
- You're out of the game.

22
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:34,700
Forget it!
Forget it, man!

23
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,409
Dude, it's not worth it!
Come on!

24
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,370
We'll have to take a blood sub.

25
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,414
I'm not sitting.

26
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:43,456
No. Sub him out.

27
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,436
Wait, wait, wait!

28
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,612
Way to go, Ricky.

29
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,696
That's your best hit of the day.

30
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,426
Let's go!

31
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,241
No blood. I'm ready.

32
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,907
We're good, yeah?
He stays?

33
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,932
- He's good.
- Okay. Let's go.

34
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,946
Come on! Come on!

35
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,499
Way to be Highland!

36
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,383
Hey, Coach?

37
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,260
Nice game.

38
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,908
Played a good game, guys.

39
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,889
And great kicks today.

40
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,976
They're idiots.

41
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:04,874
They won.

42
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,653
Great game.

43
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,761
Tough loss?

44
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,535
They didn't lose.

45
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,306
They rolled over and died.

46
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,120
They gave up,
like scared little girls.

47
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,414
- No offense, son.
- We tried.

48
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,021
What do you mean you tried?

49
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,418
You try, you sit.

50
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:36,773
This is about doing.

51
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,546
Coach!

52
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,631
Yeah.

53
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:44,488
Tried.

54
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,577
Your dad just wants you to win, hon.

55
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:54,807
He wants to win.
That has nothing to do with me.

56
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,638
Hey!

57
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,201
Hey, Rick!

58
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,310
Oh! Oh!

59
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,395
Oh, they are way too drunk
to be in the water.

60
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,646
Somebody get them some wings.

61
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,357
Okay. All right.
So anyway, it gets better,

62
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:33,379
because this coconut has just got
it hanging there on his face, right?

63
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:36,717
And this guy is huge, all right?
Like Yeti big. He's big.

64
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:41,615
So, he wipes it.
Wipes it off with his hand.

65
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,594
He wipes this loogie off
with his hand.

66
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,847
And licks it.

67
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:46,620
And I swear
it's thick enough to chew.

68
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:50,683
- Oh, Mark, that's disgusting!
- Sick. I'm gonna barf.

69
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:51,310
Yeah, well...

70
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,812
All right!

71
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,315
Listen up!
Hey! Listen to my mouth!

72
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,195
We present this oh-so-delectable
trophy to the guy

73
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,487
who's gonna take us back
to nationals next year, baby.

74
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:06,217
Yeah!

75
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,659
And, and!
Sh, sh, sh!

76
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,391
And a complete massacre
of Highland!

77
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,407
Rick, what are you doing?

78
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,117
Yeah! Whoo!

79
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,307
Come on, baby!

80
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:43,018
- I don't think I'm this drunk.
- Yes, you are!

81
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,477
Yeah-hoo!

82
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,428
Tami, you okay?

83
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,241
Tami?

84
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:33,577
Tami!

85
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:40,040
Natalie Penning, do you have
anything further to offer this court?

86
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:45,983
He's better than he seems
on paper, Your Honor.

87
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:49,527
I just hope you can see that.

88
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:52,133
Does the young man's father
have anything to add?

89
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,366
He was unable to attend.

90
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,118
Then, we'll proceed.
You may be seated.

91
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,994
Thank you, Your Honor.

92
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,746
Richard Seymour Penning, Jr.

93
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:08,186
He prefers Rick, Your Honor.

94
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,064
Counselor,

95
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:12,774
considering this young man's
drunk-driving career,

96
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,588
he is fresh out
of what he prefers.

97
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:17,778
Do we understand?

98
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:20,698
Yes, Your Honor.

99
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,260
Stand up.

100
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:30,392
Mr. Penning,
this is your second D.U.I.

101
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,269
You have now
compounded that travesty

102
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:34,875
by seriously injuring
a passenger.

103
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,252
Had this happened when you
were 18, you would be in prison.

104
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,214
So, effective immediately,
you are a ward of this Court.

105
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,299
I have therefore determined
that you will be transported

106
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:48,322
and placed in the Wasatch County
Juvenile Detention Center

107
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:49,885
in Salt Lake City, Utah.

108
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:53,327
Prior to your 18th birthday
there will be a review to determine

109
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,454
whether you will be placed
on probation

110
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,165
or transferred
to an adult correctional facility

111
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,458
until such time
as this Court deems you

112
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:05,419
no longer a danger
to yourself and society.

113
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,000
Nice to meet you, Rick.

114
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,229
I'm Marcus Tate,
Administrator here at Wasatch.

115
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:37,527
You can call me King Tate,
Sir Mark, Marcus,

116
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,716
whatever you like.

117
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,322
Where's my stuff, Marcus?

118
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:45,240
Why, I had the bellhop
take it to your suite.

119
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,495
Lmportant.

120
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,937
This is Bingham,
my right hand at Wasatch.

121
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,440
Hey, haole.

122
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,733
You'll be dealing mostly
with Bingham, myself,

123
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:04,424
a couple of interns --
anyone else? No. That's about it.

124
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:05,987
I'll show you the rooms.

125
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,261
Here you go.

126
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,492
No doors.

127
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,827
No secrets.

128
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:19,852
It's a part of "Listen Right".

129
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:23,396
Well, I'll let you get settled.

130
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,377
Dinner's in a half hour.

131
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,779
Oh! No spinning!
I said no spinning from the beginning.

132
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,011
...the front-running flyers
ripped the Sabres, 143.

133
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,658
...Dan Quinn scored three times,

134
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:42,265
helping the Penguins
throttle the Jets 8-3.

135
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,037
The Leafs throttled...

136
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:47,790
I just want to say hi.

137
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,438
And, uh...

138
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,130
I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

139
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,074
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,911
I miss you.

141
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:10,413
Bye.

142
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:37,413
I'm telling you, let's jack him.

143
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,392
Nah, he's too much
of a pretty boy for jacking.

144
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,729
A guy like you,
what would you say?

145
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,107
Oxy? Vics? Percs?

146
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:50,442
Or maybe he's just in here
for his own protection.

147
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,840
Hey, we all say
why we're in here, man.

148
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,445
Ernesto here,
stealing Girl Scout cookies.

149
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,053
Me, for beating up Ernesto.

150
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,763
You?

151
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,726
For being a pretty boy?

152
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:08,895
Hey, get off him, punk!

153
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,397
Come on!

154
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,113
Are you gonna yell at me or what?

155
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,511
Shh. Just listen.

156
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,953
Deep down.

157
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,894
Was it right?

158
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:41,212
What?

159
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,817
Hey, it wasn't me.
Those freaks started it.

160
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,903
You offended the home.

161
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,134
This is retarded.

162
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,408
You just offended the home again,
not to mention me.

163
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:56,430
Okay, I'm sorry.

164
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,307
Are you and the home happy now?

165
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,165
Almost.

166
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,895
About 10 minutes. Lights out.

167
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,292
Better hurry up.
You take forever.

168
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:34,274
Now, I want you guys to take notes.

169
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:35,524
I'm talking about something
really serious.

170
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:38,026
I need you guys to pay
attention, yeah? Okay?

171
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,756
You want me to say
I love it here.

172
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,590
Fine.

173
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,176
Great. I love it. It's...

174
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:13,262
I really don't even think
I want to leave.

175
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,348
I want you to be honest, Rick.

176
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:17,537
You want me to be honest?

177
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:18,996
I hate it.

178
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:22,123
Every day
for the last six months.

179
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,563
I deserve it.

180
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:26,814
I know that.

181
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,733
I didn't say that.

182
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,756
Is Dad there?

183
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,779
Hey.

184
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,074
He wants to talk to you.

185
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,327
I thought he'd be home by now.

186
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,397
Don't worry. I get it.

187
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,007
Merry Christmas, Mom.

188
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:04,343
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

189
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,825
Go, go, go, go!

190
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:16,436
Hey, Penning!
You too pretty to play?

191
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,460
Come on. We need you on "D".
We'll play touch if you want.

192
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,711
- He won't play.
- Come and play with us.

193
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:22,900
He's afraid of messing up
his pretty face.

194
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,881
I only play rugby.

195
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,444
All right. Listen up.

196
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,718
We usually play with 15 sides,
7 backs, 8 forwards.

197
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,387
But we're just gonna have to
make do with what we got here.

198
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,366
All right. All you guys
in blue shirts on my left.

199
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,243
All the guys in the gray shirts
on my right.

200
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,015
Line up about 2 feet apart.

201
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,123
You, back up about 5 yards.
You're gonna throw the ball in.

202
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,042
Now, if you get tackled
and you go down,

203
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:50,107
you must release the ball
back to one of your own guys.

204
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,819
Then he takes it and goes.

205
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,425
We don't stop. There's
no huddles, no time-outs.

206
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,823
So it's kind of like
football and soccer.

207
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,283
It's kind of like rugby.

208
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:08,767
You always have to pass the ball
sideways or back, like this.

209
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,227
- Nice catch.
- You just keep going

210
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,624
until you score, the ball
goes out, or someone dies.

211
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:15,128
Man, this is just
a bad rip-off of football.

212
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,003
Actually, Americans
ripped off rugby,

213
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,567
then they added
sissy pads and helmets.

214
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,651
Whatever.
You're going down either way.

215
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:22,319
Yeah. We'll see.

216
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,657
Throw it in
over your head like this.

217
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:29,513
Actually, you know what?
You should back up about 5 or 6 feet.

218
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:33,580
All right. You guys ready?

219
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:52,134
Down for the count, son!
He's down for the count!

220
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,954
107 days, Darren.

221
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,977
Oh, come on.
You can get through it, man.

222
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,960
Don't need to teach you
the same thing every day.

223
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,147
Sounds like
he's in a good mood.

224
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:07,877
Better!

225
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,274
Well, you better get back here
in time for nationals, buddy.

226
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:11,734
Man, my dad's
not gonna let me play.

227
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,235
Oh, come on. He wants to win.
He'll play you.

228
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,007
Hey, I'm sending
something your way

229
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:17,570
that I think
might cheer you up.

230
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,074
Hey, brah.
Marcus is waiting, yo.

231
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:22,679
I'm still on the phone.

232
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,868
Dude, they check my mail.

233
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:28,727
- I know that. I'm not an idiot.
- You're not?

234
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,394
Aloha 'Oe.

235
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,981
Marcus is waiting.

236
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,172
Hey, man, what's
so important that--?

237
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:41,758
Rick Penning,
this is Kurt, "Q" and Tumo.

238
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,676
I know you love rugby, and I know
you've heard of Highland.

239
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,551
They started their practices
a week ago,

240
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,845
- so I thought--
- Oh. You thought wrong.

241
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,659
- As usual.
- Yeah. Well, we win.

242
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,223
Yeah. We beat you.

243
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,143
You can come and find out how.

244
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,165
I already know how.
You cheat.

245
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,939
Man, you don't know anything.
Seriously.

246
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:03,650
Well, then, you can come find out
how we cheat.

247
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,090
- How about that?
- Not interested.

248
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,301
What's up, dude?
Back up, man!

249
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,812
We both know
that you've done all you can

250
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,251
to avoid learning anything
while you've been here.

251
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,840
The upside is we've got the cleanest
bathrooms that we've ever had.

252
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,530
All you've wanted to do
since being here

253
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:41,180
is go back to Arizona
the same kid.

254
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,158
So?

255
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:49,517
So if going home
is all you're about,

256
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:52,227
you ought to know that the judge
can reduce your time here

257
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,938
based on my evaluation.

258
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,192
Sometime check out
the back of your closet.

259
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:24,648
252.

260
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:30,590
I carved one of those a day
when I was 16.

261
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,533
I didn't always have my head
screwed on straight.

262
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:40,392
Rick, most of what we do here

263
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:43,519
I learned playing rugby
from Coach Gelwix.

264
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:45,813
I owe that man my life.

265
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:50,816
I wanted Kurt and the other players
to talk to you for a reason.

266
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,548
How much sooner?

267
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,007
I don't know.

268
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,030
Maybe before the end
of rugby season.

269
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:11,562
Belt up, brah.

270
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,063
I'm not your "bra",
so quit calling me that.

271
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,504
Okay, okay. No problem.
Belt up...

272
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,755
...sister.

273
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,591
Ain't hardly no worries. I get paid
by the hour, not the mile.

274
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,271
Holoholo!

275
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:56,699
Let's get them going!
Knees up! Pick it up!

276
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:58,993
Let's have a good practice!
Let's do it! Focus!

277
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,039
Up! Up! There you go!
Keep it going! Nice!

278
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:06,813
Rick Penning?

279
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,043
It's important for you
to know right up front,

280
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:13,691
if you spend a whole lot of time
in the gym, you work your hardest

281
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:15,153
with a complete commitment
to do your best,

282
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:18,175
you eat smart, get enough sleep,
and you work your tail off,

283
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,844
and someday...

284
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,136
someday you can
have a body like mine.

285
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:27,661
Glad you're here. It'd be great
to teach you how to play rugby.

286
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:29,120
I already know how to play rugby.

287
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,788
Oh, yeah? Okay. We'll see.

288
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,645
You're gonna be late.
Come on.

289
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,208
- Good job, Root!
- Come on!

290
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,085
- Get 'em up! Get 'em up!
- Keep 'em high! Keep 'em high!

291
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,129
Griggsie!

292
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:40,797
You're late!

293
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,297
Let's go, guys!

294
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,696
Let's see it higher, higher, higher!
There you go!

295
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,512
Addison, four corner!
Let's go!

296
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:56,226
All right, guys!

297
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:00,290
Hey, come on! Go!

298
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,939
There you go. Good.

299
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,650
Pop it! Come on, pop it!

300
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,692
Yeah, keep it going!

301
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,071
Five! Down for five! Let's go!

302
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,406
Good job, rookie!

303
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:16,552
Thataway!

304
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:19,890
Let's go! Come on!

305
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:32,712
Randy out, Penning in.

306
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,587
Make 'em work, guys!
Rugby passes!

307
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,777
Rugby passes! Let's go!

308
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:38,966
Let's go! Let's go!

309
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:43,033
Come on!

310
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:47,098
- Oh!
- Down for five!

311
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:52,832
Take a left! Take a left!

312
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:56,480
Right, right, right!
Go left! Go left!

313
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,485
That's all right. But one day
you'll learn how to go left. Yeah?

314
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:03,361
There you go, Farley!

315
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,063
Hey, man, shouldn't he
be down here coaching?

316
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,505
He been doing the coaching, brah.
Go, go, go, go!

317
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,763
Hi, you've reached the Pennings.

318
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,222
We can't get to the phone --

319
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:58,716
One, two, one, two...

320
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:21,649
All right, guys.
Bring it in. Let's go!

321
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:23,318
Keep it going!

322
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,924
Bounce those feet off the turf
like it means something to you!

323
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:27,591
Knees up! Knees up!

324
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:30,720
Our season starts in three days
with New Haven.

325
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:32,075
We ready?

326
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,326
Yes, Coach!

327
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:35,828
Coach Gelwix asked me
to offer up a reminder.

328
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,184
Do we drink?

329
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:38,436
No, Coach!

330
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,312
Do we smoke or use drugs?

331
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,458
No, Coach!

332
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:44,793
And with the girls, do you keep
yourselves clean and out of trouble?

333
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:46,148
Yes, Coach!

334
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:47,711
You got to give your word
to yourself

335
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,900
and to your brothers
on the team.

336
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,360
What are you laughing at?

337
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,426
Coach, how are you gonna know
if we drink or get with the honeys?

338
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,406
Because you'd tell
Coach Gelwix yourself.

339
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,387
Do we cheat? Do we lie?

340
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:00,743
No, Coach!

341
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,663
We got to have complete trust
in each other.

342
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,164
You lie, you burn the bridge.

343
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:10,336
Any player who lies or cheats
is gone for the season.

344
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:13,150
The only lies allowed
at Highland Rugby, gentlemen,

345
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,337
are by me about my rugby career.

346
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:17,005
Who are we?

347
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,568
Highland Rugby!

348
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,758
Till the death.
All right, guys, take a knee.

349
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,406
Randy.

350
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,742
Thanks, Coach.

351
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:30,349
- Phipp.
- Coach.

352
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:32,120
Opetich.

353
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:35,771
We're about winning gentlemen,
and not just in rugby.

354
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,125
And for that reason,

355
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,670
you will obtain a laserlike focus
on and off the field.

356
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,694
That means discipline
over every part of your life.

357
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,885
So, if you want easy, go play lacrosse
or football or join the Marines.

358
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:53,283
Welcome, gentlemen,
to Highland Rugby.

359
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:54,638
Coach!

360
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:57,766
Gladly. Hit the field, boys.
Let's go!

361
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:01,206
- Positions! Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's go!

362
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:02,873
Don't be lazy!
Let's not be lazy!

363
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:13,405
They're like freaking choir boys.

364
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,907
Yeah, I know they are, Rick,
but you got to open your eyes.

365
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,409
Yeah. You're in the inner sanctum.

366
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,325
No, man. Unh-unh.
I am done.

367
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,514
Early out's not even worth it.

368
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,808
You know, you're not there
to just suck up some judge.

369
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,580
Get over yourself.
You're there to glom their secrets

370
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:28,414
and find out how they win.

371
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,812
They run everyone to death.
That's how they win.

372
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,689
Okay, so what?

373
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,066
- Gina, chill, would you?
- Get off the phone.

374
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,759
You, uh, get a little present yet?

375
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:43,115
It should make you happy.

376
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,722
Yeah, it's cool, man.

377
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:46,451
Thanks.

378
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:49,161
Did you see Tam's message?

379
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:54,477
You wrote that, you loser.
She won't even talk to me.

380
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:55,206
That's her mom, man.

381
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:58,230
And I didn't write that.
Tami did.

382
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,209
Think about it, Rick.

383
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,252
Don't stress.

384
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:04,797
Don't stress, Rick.

385
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,090
Let's go, guys! Keep it tight!

386
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:09,326
Looking good! Looking good.

387
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:11,306
You've all earned yourself
a three-second break.

388
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,392
One, two, three.
All right, you know the drill.

389
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,062
Start unloading stuff.

390
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,730
Grab something
and keep it moving.

391
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:20,900
Pass me that shovel.

392
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,045
Wear that, Sanchez.

393
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:35,805
Here you go, buddy.

394
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:40,079
Come on, man!

395
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,083
Let's go, guys.
Clean all the trash.

396
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,543
Grab those rakes!

397
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,942
You're not into landscaping?

398
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:52,382
It's one thing to run my guts out
for you not playing rugby,

399
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,632
but this sucks.

400
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:57,073
They can pay someone to do this.

401
00:30:57,178 --> 00:30:58,219
Son, when are you gonna dig down

402
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:01,139
and first-string
the real Rick Penning?

403
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,014
I'm not your son.

404
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,619
Hey, guys, let's finish up!

405
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,018
Got to get to the sixth floor.

406
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,622
What's on the sixth floor?

407
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:13,439
You don't get what Coach Gelwix
is doing, do you?

408
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,149
It's what he's not doing.

409
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:18,859
He just wants you
to do your best.

410
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,717
Well, running until you puke
isn't my idea of rugby.

411
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,012
Well, maybe someone
who's coached 31 years

412
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:27,722
has some good ideas.

413
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,119
What are you doing?

414
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,266
Did he put you up to this?

415
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,976
No. What are you
talking about, huh?

416
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,539
I'm an only child.

417
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,457
I don't need a big brother.

418
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:43,463
How about a friend, hm?

419
00:31:43,672 --> 00:31:44,713
Is that what you are?

420
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,381
Yeah.

421
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,973
How about that one?

422
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,516
You're gonna help out, right?

423
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,977
All right.

424
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,625
It's not my thing.

425
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:51,535
First game!

426
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,749
Look at number 12.

427
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,938
So, you ladies
must be rugby fans.

428
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,127
What makes you say that?

429
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:03,003
Well, because you're sitting
in my fan section.

430
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,132
So, are you?

431
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:07,277
We're Highland fans, yeah.

432
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,467
Well, then, today's your lucky day.

433
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:10,508
I'm their new wing.

434
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,802
Really?

435
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,262
Are you any good?

436
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:15,929
Well, yeah.

437
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,972
I'm the best.

438
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:21,662
Wow. Then I guess I'll have
to keep my eye on you, huh?

439
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:27,083
You know, rugby's not
the only thing that I'm good at.

440
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,379
Let's go, guys! Come on!
Bring it together!

441
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,046
Let's go! Hustle, hustle!

442
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,756
Hey, Penning!
Get your butt down here!

443
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,571
Sorry to cut this short, ladies,
but they need me on the field.

444
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,135
Try not to hurt yourself!

445
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:45,120
Hey, I'm gonna say this once,
all right?

446
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:46,267
Back off.

447
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:48,350
Hey, baby. Don't stress.

448
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:50,434
They just want to meet me.

449
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:53,563
Bring it in, guys!
Let's go! Hustle.

450
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:57,004
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
Let's go.

451
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:59,818
Okay, listen up, guys.

452
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,383
We've got a couple
of changes today.

453
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:03,468
We're starting Sanchez at 13.

454
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:07,116
Penning, you're at 2.

455
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,428
2?

456
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:08,992
Ah, give it up for him, guys.

457
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:09,722
Good iob, brah.

458
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,869
Peter!

459
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:11,807
Let's go.

460
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,100
Riggs.

461
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:16,499
- Thank you.
- Penning.

462
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:19,312
First game, gentlemen.
Play it like your last.

463
00:34:19,313 --> 00:34:22,127
No regrets, all right?
Bring it in.

464
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:24,524
Highland Rugby on three!

465
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:25,671
One, two, three!

466
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:27,130
Highland Rugby! Whoo!

467
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,799
All right, guys.
Let's do it!

468
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,257
Let's go!

469
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,343
Congrats, man.

470
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:34,950
Read it. It's from a guy
that used to play your number.

471
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,201
I don't play hook.

472
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,556
You read it.

473
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:40,891
Look, brah, position
is everything, okay?

474
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:42,977
Coach Gelwix knows.
Just trust him.

475
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:44,853
No. He doesn't know.

476
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:46,939
He's been sitting over there
on his stupid lawn chair

477
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,190
ever since I've been here.

478
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,440
What don't I know?

479
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:53,401
I play wing.

480
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:56,527
I score.
That is what I do.

481
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,030
I doesn't matter who scores.

482
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:01,532
It only matters that we score.

483
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:06,120
The team is the star here,
not any one player.

484
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,684
Rick, if you can't handle

485
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:09,976
or don't want to handle
our coaching or our rules,

486
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,332
that's fine.

487
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:12,479
Rugby's hard enough.

488
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,981
We're out to make it harder.

489
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:17,275
It's your choice.

490
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,410
Just give it a shot, okay?

491
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,555
I'm on your side.

492
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,437
Crouch and hold...

493
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:39,062
...engage!

494
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:41,876
Hey, get down.

495
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:45,211
Number 2!
You got to stay low. Get down.

496
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,507
Crouch and hold!

497
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,487
Engage!

498
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:53,240
And the New Haven
scrum half-sets the ball.

499
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,265
Line captain. Warning, number 2.
Dangerous hit.

500
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,830
Come on.
The way we practiced, all right?

501
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:03,976
I don't play hook!

502
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,332
Come on, Penning!

503
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,415
Position, position!

504
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:10,857
An excellent pass
to Kurt Addison

505
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:14,818
results in New Haven
standing him up into a maul.

506
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,074
Oh, Highland's
number 2 rips the ball out,

507
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,638
but he's clearly offsides.

508
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,411
I'm sure the refs
gonna call this one back.

509
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:29,413
Forward pass.

510
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:31,393
I don't know how
you did it in Arizona,

511
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:33,165
but here we play as a team.

512
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:36,188
Okay, I don't play for your team.
I play for myself.

513
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:37,648
That's great! Real great!

514
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:39,420
We got to pull him.

515
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,339
They'll work it out.

516
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:47,239
And our score,
New Haven 21, Highland 14.

517
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:03,919
New Haven scores
again, giving them a 26-14 lead.

518
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:05,064
And it is evident the crowd

519
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:08,088
is not pleased with Highland's
new hook, Rick Penning.

520
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:09,965
Highland not playing well
under the pressure.

521
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:11,840
You're willing
to take a loss for this kid?

522
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,239
It's not always about rugby, Cal.

523
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,545
10 minutes in the bin.

524
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:33,630
What?!
What are you talking about?

525
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,026
Just let it go.
Let's just play, okay?

526
00:37:36,027 --> 00:37:38,424
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

527
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,134
Come on.
Let's get it, fellas!

528
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,220
ANNOUNCER, ON RADlO:
It's over, folks.

529
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:47,494
New Haven
crushes Highland 47-14.

530
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,372
After 23 consecutive wins,

531
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,248
it was bound
to happen sometime.

532
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:59,275
Did we do our best out there?

533
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,568
ALL, MUMBLING:
No, Coach.

534
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:06,154
If they were bigger, stronger,
faster, that would be one thing.

535
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:10,115
If they just plain beat us,
we could keep our head up.

536
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,512
No regret.

537
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,725
But we didn't play
our game today.

538
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,584
We didn't put up our best.

539
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,147
We didn't leave it all
on the field.

540
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:31,905
We owe more to the guys whose
numbers you got on your backs.

541
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:41,597
So, let's go see
what you got left in the tank.

542
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:44,309
Practice doesn't make perfect!
Practice makes...

543
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:45,768
Permanent!

544
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:47,748
Who are we?

545
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,356
Highland Rugby. Kia kaha.

546
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:52,755
Yo, Kurt.
What's that mean?

547
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,944
It means you don't belong here.

548
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:56,507
- Hey, what's your problem, man?
- You!

549
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,472
This isn't worth it!

550
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,182
No, you're not worth it, Penning.

551
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:09,329
But don't worry about it, all right?

552
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:13,290
'Cause every burnout
we've ever had quits.

553
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,188
By the way, you're bleeding.

554
00:39:20,796 --> 00:39:23,402
All right, let's go!
Come on, let's go, let's go!

555
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,898
Hey, what's the secret sign,
my Arizona brother?

556
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,633
Well, you asked for that.

557
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:04,580
You're real funny.

558
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,333
Hey, brother number 2.

559
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:38,461
I have a beautiful wife
and great kids.

560
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,171
I love them all very much.

561
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,152
There's a brotherhood
on this Highland Rugby

562
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:46,801
that you're not going to feel
any other place or time.

563
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:48,780
Love it while you got it, brah.

564
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:53,472
You're not alone,
never on or off the field.

565
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:56,807
I'm always with you.
I care.

566
00:40:56,808 --> 00:41:00,039
So do a couple of thousand others.

567
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:01,291
Make us proud.

568
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:03,377
Make yourself proud.

569
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,245
Is you ready, man?

570
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:25,058
- Ready for what?
- Personal running.

571
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:28,916
Four miles a day,
ten 100-yard sprints, ten 50s.

572
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,104
Coach upped the numbers
after you left.

573
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,981
I didn't leave.
I quit.

574
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,546
Yeah, but we didn't quit, man.

575
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:36,944
Leave me alone.

576
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,743
It's 5:00 in the morning.

577
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,410
How did you guys
even get in here?

578
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:51,121
Well, let's just say Coach Gelwix
called in a favor.

579
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:52,684
So, we're gonna
be going or what?

580
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,290
You guys are both insane.

581
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:00,190
And, man, you stink!

582
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,171
Yeah, that's me, baby.

583
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:05,297
Tradition. Griggsie
doesn't shower during season.

584
00:42:05,194 --> 00:42:06,237
Why?

585
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,531
Well, it's bad karma.
Do you want a hug, buddy?

586
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:09,052
No.

587
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,805
Come on, man.
Let's go. Get up.

588
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,890
Come on. Get up, man.

589
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,395
- Yeah. That's right.
- All right.

590
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:23,021
Let's do it!

591
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:27,920
Hey, Ricardo!

592
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,214
Come on.
Let's pick it up, guys.

593
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,610
I got an early class today.

594
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:05,449
No. He would
never play for Gelwix.

595
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,097
Uh, well, I talked to him.

596
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:11,496
I guess the judge
will let him out early if he does.

597
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:13,894
But, you know, this way he'll be
out in time for nationals.

598
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,187
Yeah, and back here
to play for us.

599
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:20,253
And loaded with all their strategies,
secret plays, and stuff.

600
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:22,441
Maybe he wanted to surprise you.

601
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:23,484
What position?

602
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:24,528
Huh?

603
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:26,404
What position is he playing?

604
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:28,384
Hook.

605
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:29,322
I think. I don't know.

606
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:31,199
He was moaning about it.

607
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,576
All right, guys.

608
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:37,035
Let's hit the field.

609
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:39,120
See you out there, Coach.

610
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:46,731
Father in heaven, bless us,

611
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:51,527
Father in heaven, bless us,

612
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:53,612
to do our best,

613
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:55,176
to play well,

614
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:57,678
to play safe.

615
00:43:58,512 --> 00:43:59,971
Bless the other team
from Sweden...

616
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:00,806
Scotland.

617
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,307
...whatever,

618
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:04,870
to do the same.

619
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,164
Thank you for past brothers
who are with us.

620
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,082
Help us to remember
what has been done by them before,

621
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:13,938
to feel the ma'na,
the power of family,

622
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:17,172
those living, those gone,

623
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:23,843
like my father and my mother,

624
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:25,722
Amen.

625
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:27,597
Amen.

626
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,681
All right, everybody up.
Bring it in on, Kurt!

627
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:30,724
Let's go, guys!

628
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,018
Highland Rugby on three!
One, two, three!

629
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,789
Highland Rugby! Whoo!

630
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:42,920
- Brother...
- Is something wrong?

631
00:44:43,025 --> 00:44:47,090
Yeah, we're doing that dance,
the chant. I don't know it.

632
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:51,781
You know it now, brah.

633
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,075
What's it mean?

634
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:57,309
Respect for our family
and our ancestors.

635
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:03,353
We stand on this field
ready for battle,

636
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:06,585
Heh!

637
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:13,777
At our backs,
we feel the might of tradition,

638
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,549
remembering to honor our family

639
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,572
and our ancestors
who have gone before.

640
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:19,823
Over our hearts...

641
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,559
...we bear the emblem to die for.

642
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:29,208
This challenge
is now thrown to you.

643
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:42,967
Let's go.

644
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:19,140
Whoa!

645
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:30,922
Ka mate! Ka mate!

646
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,380
Ka ora! Ka ora!

647
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:35,404
Ka mate! Ka mate!
Ka ora! Ka ora!

648
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,532
Tenei te tangata
Puhuru huru

649
00:46:38,637 --> 00:46:41,346
Nana i tiki mai
Whakawhiti te ra

650
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:43,743
A, upa... ne!
A, upa... ne!

651
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:48,226
A upane, ka upane
Whiti te ra... Hi!

652
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,706
Let's go!

653
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:16,894
Attack! Attack!

654
00:47:17,937 --> 00:47:19,187
Highland has the ball,

655
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,898
passing now to their fullback,
Quentin Owens,

656
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:22,836
who slides...

657
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,191
That's it, kiddo!

658
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,350
Owens with another 5 points,

659
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,998
and Highland's starting
to put this one away.

660
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:55,361
Every time they try
to get something going,

661
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,132
Highland just crushes it.

662
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,667
- Was that you?
- Yeah, man.

663
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:14,856
Great tackle.

664
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:15,690
Thanks.

665
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:17,670
There's been good scrapping
on both sides,

666
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:20,797
but at 29 to Scotland 7,

667
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:23,924
this exhibition has turned
into a Highland clinic.

668
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,549
Yeah!

669
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,513
That was so good!

670
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:31,534
Way to play tonight, brah.
That's what I'm talking about.

671
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:32,890
You was in the zone tonight.

672
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:35,602
Hey, I'll be back, now.
Give me a second.

673
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:42,169
You just can't seem to stay away.

674
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,046
How did I do?

675
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,339
Not bad for a rookie.

676
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:50,926
I know this is gonna be tough on you,

677
00:48:50,926 --> 00:48:52,801
but I don't have another game
until next week,

678
00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:55,408
so you're gonna have
to hang in there another six days.

679
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:58,223
Ooh. Yeah, you're right.

680
00:48:58,223 --> 00:48:59,995
I just don't know
if I can wait that long.

681
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:03,434
- Can you?
- Oh, never!

682
00:49:04,373 --> 00:49:05,728
Rama!

683
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:08,440
Griggsie's leaving
within 10 minutes, so...

684
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,482
...come on, let's go!

685
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:10,732
What's a Rama?

686
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:11,983
I'll show you. Come on.

687
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:13,650
I'll see you later.

688
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:15,112
Bye.

689
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:29,914
Wow, muchas gracias, senorita.

690
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,062
Welcome to Ranch-A-Rama.

691
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,876
Would you like one or two pieces?

692
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,230
Huh?

693
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,898
She wants to know
how much you want, bud.

694
00:49:36,898 --> 00:49:37,732
Whole thing.

695
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:39,923
Well, yeah, but...

696
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:43,362
Well, it is all you can eat, right?

697
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,742
Honestly, is it me, or did Rick
actually pass the ball tonight?

698
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:48,888
Yeah, good iob!

699
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:50,242
Hey! Hey!

700
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:52,536
But that's only 'cause
he thought hisself was open.

701
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:57,330
Kurt, start it up!

702
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,416
Ohhh!

703
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:15,261
Highland, my main man!

704
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:19,119
Huh, huh, huh, huh!

705
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:21,621
Hey, wait a second.
Pull over real quick.

706
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:23,601
No bus, my car.
I don't want to pull over.

707
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:24,435
Just pull over, all right?

708
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:26,207
C'mon, man. It's kind of late.

709
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:27,980
Just pull over.

710
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:31,524
Always trying to kill my vibes.

711
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,759
I thought we had a jack.

712
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:41,531
Oh, don't worry about it.
We got two.

713
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:42,470
Oh, good.

714
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,930
I still can't get
the wheel off, though.

715
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:44,973
Okay.

716
00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:47,787
Let's go.

717
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:50,393
Go. Ooh-uh.

718
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:52,896
Ooh, cool! Let me try!

719
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,293
What did I tell you?
Stay out of the street.

720
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:56,856
Hey, Kurt. You need a hand?

721
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,523
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

722
00:50:58,524 --> 00:51:00,818
I want you to stand
right over here.

723
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:04,676
Soccer is for kids.

724
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,281
Football is for wussies.

725
00:51:07,386 --> 00:51:08,949
Rugby's for men.

726
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,556
You keep that, eh?

727
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:13,222
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

728
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:16,560
Lift open the trunk.

729
00:51:16,768 --> 00:51:17,914
Thanks.

730
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:30,319
Kurt!

731
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:34,073
Kurt, Kurt, come on.
Come on, man.

732
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,575
You'll be okay.
Tumo, go get help! Go get help!

733
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:37,409
Kurt!

734
00:51:37,513 --> 00:51:40,433
Stay with us, man. Come on.
Stay with us.

735
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:53,984
What's going on?
What happened? What?

736
00:51:53,984 --> 00:51:54,818
It's Kurt, man.

737
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:56,069
He's in surgery, man.

738
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:06,077
He just needs to run it out, son.

739
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:02,684
Never had a player
who wanted to win more.

740
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:07,479
Incredible athlete.

741
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,189
Rugby was in his blood.

742
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:14,046
He didn't always like to listen.

743
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,510
He blew out a knee
a game before nationals,

744
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,739
and all his dreams
for an overseas pro rugby career

745
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,096
just gone like that.

746
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:30,726
Your father would swear
to this day that he got hurt

747
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:34,480
because I played him
in the wrong position.

748
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,753
Why haven't you told me
about this?

749
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:44,382
Better question --
why hasn't he?

750
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,773
Well, I tell you what, guys.
Let's bring it in, okay?

751
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,588
Come on.

752
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:09,298
Bring it in.

753
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:22,329
Now, "Q"
what do you say, buddy?

754
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:27,540
Come on, "Q".

755
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:09,391
Penning.

756
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:11,580
"Q".

757
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,356
I tutor him, if you have to know.

758
00:56:22,317 --> 00:56:23,255
I don't.

759
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,699
Let's go! Pick up the pace!

760
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,950
Let's move it!

761
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:36,391
Let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

762
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,853
Penning!

763
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,051
Coach?

764
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:57,864
Rick, step into my office.

765
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:08,293
Rick, I want to ask you
to be a captain.

766
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,275
"Q" is already captain.

767
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:12,256
We always have at least two.

768
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:14,966
But he can't stand me, the same
with half the guys out there.

769
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:17,156
This isn't about them.
It's about you.

770
00:57:17,156 --> 00:57:19,972
It's about being the best Rick.

771
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:22,370
Well, what about Tumo?

772
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:26,958
He and three or four other guys
came to me suggesting you.

773
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:30,503
The team doesn't get
this kind of stuff wrong.

774
00:57:34,048 --> 00:57:37,489
I know Kurt would have wanted it.

775
00:57:39,262 --> 00:57:41,347
I don't get it.

776
00:57:41,347 --> 00:57:44,474
You know exactly why I'm here,
and you still act like you care.

777
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:48,438
I'm just a no-good spy

778
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,940
who cheap-shotted
your star player last year.

779
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,756
First of all, I attribute that cheap
shot to your coach, not you,

780
00:57:53,756 --> 00:57:56,779
and second, let's focus
on where you could end up,

781
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,448
not where you were or are.

782
00:57:58,865 --> 00:58:04,599
And... God doesn't make
a no-good anything.

783
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:09,500
You just got to learn to listen

784
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:13,045
and pay attention
to that spirit inside you.

785
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:18,572
And learning to listen,
that takes a lot of discipline.

786
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:22,847
So that's why all the rules?

787
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:26,288
We only have one real rule --

788
00:58:26,288 --> 00:58:27,330
don't do anything

789
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,606
that would embarrass you,
the team, or your family.

790
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:44,743
I can't be captain.

791
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:48,185
Some friends of mine
sent me some stuff.

792
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:50,375
Vicodin.

793
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:54,232
But I don't have it anymore.
I got rid of it.

794
00:58:55,484 --> 00:58:56,839
Man!

795
00:58:56,944 --> 00:59:00,280
I cannot believe
you made me tell you that.

796
00:59:01,115 --> 00:59:04,972
Much to your credit, Rick,
I didn't make you.

797
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:10,812
And good decisions
don't make life easy.

798
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,481
But they do make it easier.

799
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:20,718
You're gonna have
to sit out the Boise game.

800
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,386
But I'm sure you'll find a way

801
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:26,139
to captain your forwards
from the sidelines.

802
00:59:34,794 --> 00:59:37,400
Welcome to Highland Rugby, Rick.

803
00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:47,411
Thanks.

804
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:29,849
Kurt was with me
when my father died.

805
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:36,001
He told me that although
his body was gone,

806
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:39,548
his spirit would always
be with me.

807
01:00:40,277 --> 01:00:42,363
Every time I do the haka,

808
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,387
I call on the power
of my family spirit.

809
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:52,580
We'll call upon Kurt's spirit now, too.

810
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:56,647
Kurt...

811
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:04,155
...he was a real friend.

812
01:01:08,742 --> 01:01:13,644
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be on this team.

813
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:19,587
He made me want
to be a better person.

814
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:26,677
I'm gonna miss that.

815
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,030
You boys might think
I coach because...

816
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:49,617
...I love rugby
and I love to win.

817
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:51,077
Both true.

818
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:55,352
But I keep coaching
because of you guys.

819
01:01:56,916 --> 01:02:00,669
That's why I'm more interested
in turning out champion boys

820
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,277
than champion teams.

821
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:07,446
I want you to be forever strong
on the field

822
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:10,367
so you'll be forever strong off it.

823
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:18,709
Kia kaha -- forever strong.

824
01:02:18,814 --> 01:02:21,316
Kia kaha.

825
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:37,998
Ka mate, ka mate

826
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:42,588
Ka mate, ka mate

827
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:47,279
Ka mate, ka mate
Ka ora, ka ora...

828
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:57,185
Come on, Phipp! I want a nice toss!

829
01:02:57,185 --> 01:02:58,644
Give me a nice toss, baby!

830
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:00,105
Let's go, Griggsie!

831
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,982
Bring it down!
Protect the ball!

832
01:03:01,982 --> 01:03:03,441
Protect the ball!

833
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:04,588
Protect it!

834
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:05,944
Get it up! Get it up!

835
01:03:05,944 --> 01:03:08,342
Run! Run! Go!

836
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:09,281
Go!

837
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,844
Go!

838
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:14,495
Yes!

839
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:17,101
That is what I'm talking about!

840
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:18,040
Whoo!

841
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:19,603
Yeah, give me some!

842
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:21,272
Yeah! Whoo!

843
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,817
I think I liked him better
on the field.

844
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:28,362
Well
much of the story this season

845
01:03:28,468 --> 01:03:30,344
has been Highland's
commitment to team play,

846
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:33,054
and after crushing
the Boise team today,

847
01:03:33,158 --> 01:03:34,826
they're in the Pacific Coast
drivers seat

848
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:37,747
to be the number-one seed
at the nationals

849
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,310
in Colorado Springs.

850
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:42,021
Settle down! Settle down!

851
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,065
Hey, nice win, guys.

852
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,046
That's the way
to take care of business.

853
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,089
Whoo-hoo!

854
01:03:47,653 --> 01:03:49,738
Oh, Griggs!
You stink, man!

855
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:50,676
Take a shower!

856
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:52,240
What you say, huh?

857
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:53,804
- Yeah!
- Griggs, man.

858
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,098
To the back of the bus.

859
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,975
Hey, come on, Griggsie.
A little mercy, man.

860
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,748
It's a winning tradition.

861
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,104
It's a stinking tradition!

862
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,459
You know where the losers sit?

863
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:04,231
In the front of the bus, yeah.
That's right.

864
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:08,924
How'd you like to scrum with that?

865
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:42,395
Since the tragic death

866
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:44,689
of team player
Kurt Addison eight weeks ago,

867
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,922
this Highland team has been
nothing but unstoppable.

868
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:50,424
They'll be returning home
with the regional title

869
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,344
and be headed
to the USA Rugby Nationals

870
01:04:53,344 --> 01:04:54,907
later this month.

871
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:22,436
What about you?
No family, Griggsie?

872
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,104
No, my parents split up.

873
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:25,250
My dad's in prison.

874
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,023
My mom,
she's a stripper out in Vegas,

875
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:28,692
or Reno or something like that.

876
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:30,255
I don't know. I don't remember.

877
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:32,863
Man, I'm sorry. I thought
that I had it bad, but you --

878
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:34,113
It's all good.

879
01:05:35,991 --> 01:05:37,972
You loser. You lied?

880
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,848
You know,
this little trust bridge we had here

881
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,308
just burned
and went right down the river.

882
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:43,185
But they're always late, so...

883
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,626
Oh, look. It's my mother.

884
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:50,693
That's a big mama.

885
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,196
Ooh, put your tongue away, dude.

886
01:05:53,301 --> 01:05:56,637
She don't like the drooling,
'cause I already tried that.

887
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:59,452
- Yeah, how long have they been--
- Together?

888
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:01,746
- Yeah.
- Since birth.

889
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:05,812
That's "Q's" sister Emily.
You did not know that?

890
01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:06,750
What?

891
01:06:08,315 --> 01:06:09,774
This has got even better.

892
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:12,172
I wouldn't touch it, man.
She's twitchy as a bunch of nuns.

893
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:14,154
- She's the Holy Grail.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

894
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,032
I tried.

895
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:22,183
You must be the sisters
that "Q" has been telling me about.

896
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,018
What are you doing?

897
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:25,831
No, I've never said a word
to him about you.

898
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:27,292
Well, you should have.

899
01:06:27,293 --> 01:06:29,378
Yeah. You should have.

900
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,463
No. I shouldn't have.

901
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:32,819
Rick Penning.

902
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:34,382
Emily Owens.

903
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:36,155
You know,
I've been watching you play.

904
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:37,927
You're actually really good.

905
01:06:38,136 --> 01:06:40,534
Well, thank you.
It's very nice of you to notice.

906
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:42,202
- Oh, well--
- "Q": We're going.

907
01:06:42,203 --> 01:06:44,184
Okay, I think I'm leaving now,

908
01:06:44,288 --> 01:06:45,748
but it was nice
to officially meet you!

909
01:06:45,853 --> 01:06:47,416
No, it wasn't.

910
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:48,356
Hey, "Q"!

911
01:06:48,564 --> 01:06:50,337
I'll see you tomorrow
at 4:00 for practice

912
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:52,005
where we usually
hang out afterwards

913
01:06:52,006 --> 01:06:53,778
and grab a bite to eat!

914
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:56,697
You a pineapple, brother.

915
01:06:57,427 --> 01:06:58,156
What?

916
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:01,388
All hard and ugly
and spiny on the outside.

917
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:02,953
Nothing but sweet
and mushy under.

918
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:04,309
Oh, you got it bad.

919
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:06,185
It's not even like that, brah.

920
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:08,583
You know, you guys
are going to nationals.

921
01:07:08,688 --> 01:07:10,773
Making Marcus
one happy brother.

922
01:07:18,178 --> 01:07:19,532
Hey.

923
01:07:20,472 --> 01:07:23,287
Dad!
What are you doing here?

924
01:07:24,225 --> 01:07:25,893
I'm taking you home.

925
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:30,480
Marcus, I told you I wanted
to finish out the season.

926
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:31,315
I know,

927
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:34,338
but based on the last two
positive evaluations I gave you,

928
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:36,841
the judge released you
from the wardship,

929
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:40,073
placing you back
in the custody of your parents.

930
01:07:41,012 --> 01:07:42,158
So what does that mean?

931
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,035
It means grab your stuff.
You're coming home.

932
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,644
Dad, I can't.
I'm the team captain!

933
01:07:46,748 --> 01:07:50,084
You're still the captain,
of the Razorbacks.

934
01:07:53,317 --> 01:07:55,819
I'm sorry.
Look, see the positive here.

935
01:07:55,924 --> 01:07:57,487
You did it.

936
01:07:57,488 --> 01:08:01,241
You got probation. You're
not going to a county lockdown.

937
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:03,534
Thanks for everything.

938
01:08:04,056 --> 01:08:06,662
Okay. Okay. That's real sweet.

939
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:08,122
This isn't summer camp.
Let's go.

940
01:08:09,582 --> 01:08:11,772
You keep listening right, okay?

941
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,403
All right, Bingham.

942
01:08:17,508 --> 01:08:20,427
Enough with the kumbayahs,
all right?

943
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,787
Nice.

944
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:32,105
It's good to have you home.

945
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:33,981
Thanks.

946
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,963
You know, tomorrow at practice,

947
01:08:36,172 --> 01:08:39,299
Rick is gonna
lay out Highland's playbook.

948
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:41,488
You know, whatever you've got
that you think we need,

949
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:47,329
you know, specific plays,
zoning, substitution strategies,

950
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,371
you just let it rip, okay?

951
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,609
You know, we're gonna
end up playing against them

952
01:08:56,714 --> 01:08:58,382
at Colorado Springs.

953
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:04,221
This is our year.

954
01:09:04,742 --> 01:09:06,514
We deserve that title.

955
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:08,809
What do you mean "we"?

956
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:11,518
My team is Highland.

957
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:14,855
Okay, you see,
you don't get to choose.

958
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:18,193
You will leave this house or not
if we say.

959
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:20,696
You will drive that car or not
if we say.

960
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:22,990
You will go to Colorado or not
if I say,

961
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,075
and right now I say
that you will be at practice

962
01:09:25,076 --> 01:09:27,057
with your Razorbacks tomorrow.

963
01:09:27,161 --> 01:09:28,516
Rick, sit down.

964
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:30,810
Have me arrested.

965
01:09:32,687 --> 01:09:34,668
What was that about?

966
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:37,586
What did I say wrong?

967
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:41,341
He's been gone a year,

968
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,156
and the only thing
you can talk about

969
01:09:44,157 --> 01:09:47,076
is having him teach
some stupid plays to your team?

970
01:09:47,076 --> 01:09:49,162
Stupid plays? Okay, look.
It's his team, too.

971
01:09:50,622 --> 01:09:52,081
Didn't you hear him?

972
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:54,584
The Razorbacks
aren't his team anymore.

973
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:56,669
He doesn't know
what he wants anymore, honey.

974
01:09:57,504 --> 01:09:59,797
Have you asked him?

975
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:05,741
I only want him
to have what I never had.

976
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:13,352
And what makes you think
that he wants what you never had?

977
01:10:13,249 --> 01:10:15,334
What about what he wants?

978
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:18,253
What he wants landed him in jail.

979
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:21,382
What is more important, Richard?

980
01:10:21,487 --> 01:10:24,093
A game or two or your son?

981
01:10:24,093 --> 01:10:26,282
Look at him.

982
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:28,889
If playing for this team

983
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:34,936
is making him more like the man
that we want him to be,

984
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:37,230
if it's making him happy --

985
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:40,151
It's in his eyes.

986
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:44,321
Just open yours, and you'll see it.

987
01:10:51,517 --> 01:10:54,332
Okay, I'll try. Okay?

988
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:00,900
You try. You sit.
This is about doing, Coach.

989
01:12:15,559 --> 01:12:17,331
Hey, Rick!

990
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:18,478
What's up, man?

991
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:20,668
What's up, man?
When did you get back?

992
01:12:24,527 --> 01:12:25,986
Here, let me look at you.

993
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,427
Oh, Tami, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

994
01:12:29,531 --> 01:12:31,513
I'm fine.
I just want you to kiss me.

995
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:33,703
Oh, Tami, come on.

996
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,892
Baby, what's wrong?
Aren't you excited to see me?

997
01:12:35,997 --> 01:12:37,560
Tami, please.

998
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,418
Guys, I'm on probation, man.

999
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,608
You guys got to lose this.
Put it in the truck or something.

1000
01:12:43,608 --> 01:12:44,754
Oh, come on, Mr. Paranoid.

1001
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:46,527
You really see a probation schmo
around here?

1002
01:12:46,632 --> 01:12:47,466
I missed you.

1003
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:48,925
- No.
- Lars.

1004
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:51,429
Lars, I'm serious, man.
Don't put it in here.

1005
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:54,035
Okay, well, you're still taking us
for a little ride afterward.

1006
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:55,286
Come on, man.
You owe us one.

1007
01:12:56,225 --> 01:12:57,893
Rick, this is it.

1008
01:12:57,893 --> 01:12:59,561
This is our year!

1009
01:12:59,874 --> 01:13:00,813
This is it!

1010
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:03,420
- Am I right?
- Absolutely.

1011
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,818
Seriously, though, the team --
We're pure stoked

1012
01:13:05,922 --> 01:13:07,903
to have you back to give us
the Highland hookup

1013
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:09,572
on all their plays and stuff.

1014
01:13:09,572 --> 01:13:12,074
You want the Highland hookup?

1015
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:14,263
One, there's none of this, all right?

1016
01:13:14,368 --> 01:13:16,557
It's about character and honor.

1017
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:19,894
What's he talking about?

1018
01:13:19,998 --> 01:13:21,667
I'm sorry, uh...

1019
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,169
...character and honor?

1020
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:27,819
Yeah, and we also don't do anything
to embarrass ourselves, our families,

1021
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:29,071
or our team.

1022
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:30,113
Hey! Whoa!

1023
01:13:30,218 --> 01:13:32,928
What, so, you don't drink now?

1024
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,203
Rick, you're talking
like you still play for them.

1025
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,393
You want to know what Highland
teaches? Well, I'm telling you.

1026
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,208
Yeah, yeah, we want plays.
Maybe illegal hits.

1027
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,876
You really think we want you
to come around here

1028
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:45,857
and start teaching Sunday School?

1029
01:13:45,962 --> 01:13:47,317
Come on, man.
This ain't you.

1030
01:13:47,943 --> 01:13:49,611
You know what, guys?

1031
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:50,549
I'm going to practice.

1032
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,199
Lars, man,
let's just get out of here.

1033
01:13:54,617 --> 01:13:57,537
Well, the old Rick used to take it
any way he could get it.

1034
01:13:57,537 --> 01:13:58,683
You should suck it up.

1035
01:13:58,789 --> 01:14:00,561
Rick, what's wrong with you?

1036
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:05,461
What's happened to you, Rick?

1037
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:06,607
Where's the loyalty, man?

1038
01:14:06,713 --> 01:14:09,111
I mean, we've been talking about
beating Highland for the title

1039
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:10,153
since we were little kids.

1040
01:14:10,258 --> 01:14:11,613
Lars, man,
let's just go, all right?

1041
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:12,342
Let's just go, okay?

1042
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:14,010
Highland is a bunch
of choir boys, Rick!

1043
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:15,991
Yeah, and you're drunk.

1044
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:17,138
So?

1045
01:14:17,243 --> 01:14:19,119
So, we're not doing this.
I'm going to practice.

1046
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:19,849
No, Rick. Come on!

1047
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,249
All right, well, maybe we
just don't want you at practice.

1048
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,168
Maybe you should, uh, hightail it
back to Highland, huh?

1049
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,320
Lars, don't be an idiot!

1050
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:34,449
Come on, you guys!

1051
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,951
You know, a year ago you
would have killed me for that.

1052
01:14:37,994 --> 01:14:40,809
I said, "I'm not doing this".

1053
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:41,955
No...

1054
01:14:41,956 --> 01:14:44,875
Lars! Stop!
You guys, stop!

1055
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:45,813
Get a little zip on that thing.

1056
01:14:46,022 --> 01:14:46,960
Get off of him!

1057
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:48,836
Stop, you guys!

1058
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:49,567
Get off him, man!

1059
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:52,279
It's the cops! It's the cops!

1060
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:58,015
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

1061
01:15:05,313 --> 01:15:07,294
Back lines! Let's go!

1062
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,857
Move it! Go!

1063
01:15:27,211 --> 01:15:32,841
I give you the keys to the car,
and this is what I get.

1064
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,452
After what I've been through
the last year,

1065
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,390
do you really believe

1066
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:44,622
that I'd be messing with drugs
and booze the day I get home?

1067
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:50,461
Okay, there were drugs and beer
all over you and the car.

1068
01:15:50,557 --> 01:15:52,025
It was Lars and Marty.

1069
01:15:52,026 --> 01:15:54,738
Test me.
I haven't had a drink in a year.

1070
01:15:54,843 --> 01:16:00,160
Rick, do you have any idea
how much potential you had?

1071
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,245
Lars set me up!

1072
01:16:02,246 --> 01:16:04,227
See, my future was stolen.

1073
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,582
You're not even listening.

1074
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,249
And what are you doing?

1075
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,335
You're just throwing it all away?
For what? Drugs?

1076
01:16:09,335 --> 01:16:10,273
Booze? Some girl?

1077
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:12,254
So, I guess what I said really
doesn't even make a difference.

1078
01:16:12,255 --> 01:16:16,113
Rick, it kills me to sit back and
watch you throw everything away.

1079
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,259
I mean,
when are you gonna dig deep

1080
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,136
and first-string
the real Rick Penning?

1081
01:16:19,971 --> 01:16:22,576
You want to talk
about first-stringing a Penning?

1082
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,872
You won nationals in 1986.

1083
01:16:24,873 --> 01:16:27,062
You were on the original
Highland Rugby team!

1084
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,233
You were
a Highland Rugby player.

1085
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,863
I didn't win anything.

1086
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:39,573
You were on the team.
You know what they taught.

1087
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:42,285
I was on nothing.

1088
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:45,204
I saw your picture, Dad.
You were on the team.

1089
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,958
No. Gelwix made sure
that I wasn't on that team

1090
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:51,565
by putting me someplace
that I shouldn't have been.

1091
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:54,590
I told him,

1092
01:16:55,841 --> 01:17:00,428
but he insisted
that I play a forward.

1093
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,139
He was doing what was best
for you and the team.

1094
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:05,433
No, no, Gelwix stole my life!

1095
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:08,666
Well, he's given me mine back!

1096
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,613
I play for Highland.

1097
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:23,159
I am benched
for drugs and alcohol,

1098
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,871
suspended for lying.

1099
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:34,629
I don't do anything to embarrass
myself, my team, or my family.

1100
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:36,714
Not anymore.

1101
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:39,322
Highland Rugby.

1102
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:41,407
Kia kaha.

1103
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:43,388
I'm done.

1104
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,209
Rick.

1105
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:52,772
Rick.

1106
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:54,857
Rick!

1107
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,076
He was caught with the drugs, Larry.

1108
01:18:05,702 --> 01:18:08,518
He was changing.
You saw it. We all saw it.

1109
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:10,082
Well, that's why
I fought with the courts

1110
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,541
to try and keep him at Wasatch.

1111
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,314
When I heard
they were discharging him,

1112
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,357
I told them he wasn't ready.

1113
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:19,258
Maybe you both should have
a little bit more faith in him.

1114
01:18:19,258 --> 01:18:20,613
Maybe.

1115
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:29,372
- Good night, Coach.
- Good night.

1116
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:33,229
I know how much
you cared about this boy.

1117
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:38,861
And when I can't help
these young men

1118
01:18:38,862 --> 01:18:42,511
become champions
in their own lives, it's...

1119
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:53,458
Maybe it is time.

1120
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:19,109
You're out, man.
Come on. Let's go.

1121
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:20,778
Move it!

1122
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:27,972
Mom.

1123
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:29,745
Tami, what's going on?

1124
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,830
Larry Gelwix called.

1125
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:34,332
We talked for a long time.

1126
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:35,689
He wouldn't let me off the phone

1127
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:37,671
until I promised
to do some digging.

1128
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:41,528
Tami told the police
what really happened.

1129
01:19:42,363 --> 01:19:44,761
I thought you were with Lars
and Marty on this.

1130
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:48,305
Maybe I didn't want
to hold you back anymore.

1131
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:53,414
Where's Dad?

1132
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:56,959
Your dad thought
you might be able to use this.

1133
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:03,216
He also said that he knew you
wouldn't be able to respect him

1134
01:20:03,312 --> 01:20:06,865
unless he still tried
to beat Highland,

1135
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,951
even with you as their hook.

1136
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:16,772
Let's get out of here.

1137
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:19,065
Thanks, Tami.

1138
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:21,359
USA Rugby welcomes you

1139
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:26,467
to the National High School
Championship Tournament.

1140
01:20:26,573 --> 01:20:28,033
Hello, everyone, I'm Max Griffin.

1141
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:29,492
And I'm Colton McDonald,

1142
01:20:29,597 --> 01:20:32,830
coming to you live today
from Colorado Springs, Colorado.

1143
01:20:32,831 --> 01:20:34,812
Now, we've got 16 teams,

1144
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:37,000
two from each of the country's
seven territories,

1145
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:38,980
plus two at-large entries.

1146
01:20:41,693 --> 01:20:42,527
Ladies and gentlemen,

1147
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,507
welcome to today's US Rugby
National Championship game...

1148
01:20:44,612 --> 01:20:45,758
Brother Rick!

1149
01:20:45,968 --> 01:20:47,740
...between East Lansing
and Highland.

1150
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,782
What's up, brother?

1151
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:50,659
- Come on, guys.
- What's up, brah?

1152
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:54,100
- Coach!
- Hey, Penning. Welcome back.

1153
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,559
Welcome back.

1154
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,002
Glad you're here, Rick.

1155
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:01,296
Thanks for having me back.

1156
01:21:01,401 --> 01:21:02,546
All right,
look around, gentlemen.

1157
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:04,529
This is what you've been chasing.

1158
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:05,883
Now, I want it clean,

1159
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:08,804
but these guys need to know
that they don't belong here.

1160
01:21:08,908 --> 01:21:11,618
I want you to hit 'em so hard,
you make 'em cry.

1161
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:12,661
You hearing me, Peeta?

1162
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:13,703
Yes, Coach.

1163
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:15,163
Make 'em cry.

1164
01:21:27,885 --> 01:21:29,554
Yeah! Way to go, buddy!

1165
01:21:35,913 --> 01:21:38,416
Highland is just
chewing East Lansing up

1166
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:39,355
and spitting them out.

1167
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:41,857
I tell you, Max, you do not
want to give Highland an inch

1168
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:44,151
because they will
take the whole mile.

1169
01:21:44,256 --> 01:21:47,905
This game is over.
Highland cleans house, 61-3.

1170
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:52,805
Who's missing a tooth?

1171
01:21:52,805 --> 01:21:54,056
Ladies and gentlemen,

1172
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:56,560
the next match
will begin in 15 minutes

1173
01:21:56,663 --> 01:22:00,314
between Akron United
and San Mateo Ravens.

1174
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:06,674
And so 16 teams are cut to 8,
leaving the 1 and 2 seeds,

1175
01:22:06,674 --> 01:22:09,176
the Flagstaff
and Highland teams advancing.

1176
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:12,304
Hey!

1177
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:16,266
If it isn't the Highland choir boys.

1178
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:17,518
Knock it off, Lars.

1179
01:22:17,518 --> 01:22:19,916
We're just surprised to see you
out in the free world, Penning.

1180
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,688
You know, we're actually
hoping you guys keep winning,

1181
01:22:21,793 --> 01:22:24,191
so we can play you in the finals,

1182
01:22:24,191 --> 01:22:26,484
because you will become
a very popular guy.

1183
01:22:26,485 --> 01:22:27,319
What's it up to now?

1184
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:29,822
It's like --
What do we got? 235?

1185
01:22:29,822 --> 01:22:32,638
$235 to whoever
takes you out of the game.

1186
01:22:32,743 --> 01:22:33,889
Is that right?

1187
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:34,932
You...

1188
01:22:34,932 --> 01:22:36,495
Uh, Peeta? It's okay.

1189
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:40,353
Come on, brah. Let's go! Let's go!
It's not even worth it, man.

1190
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:42,439
Not even worth it.

1191
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:46,818
Trembling there a little bit, Lars.

1192
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:48,381
Yeah, I think I peed just a little bit.

1193
01:22:48,486 --> 01:22:49,632
Just a little.

1194
01:22:49,738 --> 01:22:50,884
This is six!

1195
01:22:52,136 --> 01:22:54,429
Highland steals
the ball and passes it out.

1196
01:22:54,429 --> 01:22:56,618
They hit the gap and took it.

1197
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:00,166
Boy, just look at Swindle
breaking the line

1198
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:01,311
and putting on the gas.

1199
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:03,710
He is making some serious yards.

1200
01:23:18,204 --> 01:23:20,289
And we have a ruck
in the midfield.

1201
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:22,061
Oh, a quick ball out.

1202
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:26,024
There's a kick ahead.
And there it is.

1203
01:23:26,963 --> 01:23:28,525
Highland's fullback, Quentin Owens,

1204
01:23:28,526 --> 01:23:30,508
sweeps it up
for some easy try time.

1205
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:32,385
This is a big cleanup
by Highland.

1206
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,722
They're very, very serious
contenders in this tournament.

1207
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:40,309
That was for me.

1208
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,106
Good evening.

1209
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:04,188
That worked, yeah?

1210
01:24:04,397 --> 01:24:06,065
You guys are sick.

1211
01:24:48,815 --> 01:24:49,857
No, get back in, Mark.

1212
01:24:49,962 --> 01:24:51,214
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming.

1213
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:00,389
Griggsie?

1214
01:25:01,641 --> 01:25:03,310
Griggs, are you there?

1215
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:07,793
Griggs, let me out of here, man!
Come on! This ain't funny!

1216
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:09,461
Yee-hah!

1217
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:11,963
Griggsie,
get back here, man!

1218
01:25:11,964 --> 01:25:13,840
Coach, any predictions
on the match?

1219
01:25:13,945 --> 01:25:16,760
Oh, we're looking forward
to the challenge.

1220
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,845
My boys have worked
very hard to get here,

1221
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:20,305
and may the best team win.

1222
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:23,121
I understand your son
is playing for Highland.

1223
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:26,561
What's it going to be like
coaching against him?

1224
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:27,291
Uh...

1225
01:25:27,501 --> 01:25:30,003
Coach, is it true you used to play
for this Highland team?

1226
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:33,444
Thank you.

1227
01:25:35,634 --> 01:25:38,136
Pizza time, baby!

1228
01:25:44,705 --> 01:25:46,581
It's more fun
when you turn it on, brah.

1229
01:25:48,355 --> 01:25:51,378
Hey, uh, why don't you guys

1230
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,568
go torment some menace
in the hallway or something?

1231
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:58,365
All right. Hurry up.
Peeta eat it all.

1232
01:25:58,365 --> 01:26:00,033
Hey, let's go
watch Sanchez work out!

1233
01:26:00,137 --> 01:26:01,909
Sanchez works out?

1234
01:26:07,854 --> 01:26:10,043
And I have a 4.0 GPA.

1235
01:26:10,878 --> 01:26:12,860
You want to talk
about your grades?

1236
01:26:23,495 --> 01:26:26,205
For the last year and a half,

1237
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:30,480
I've been paying guys
to get test answers for me.

1238
01:26:35,382 --> 01:26:39,656
You know, I have lived
my whole life for my parents.

1239
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:43,202
Line by line,
what they wanted me to do.

1240
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:48,102
Highland Rugby is the only thing
that I do for me.

1241
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:51,126
I mean, I have lived
the last four years of my life

1242
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:54,150
so that I can play as a senior
for the national title.

1243
01:26:57,695 --> 01:26:59,363
And here it is.

1244
01:26:59,468 --> 01:27:03,325
And I'm this close.

1245
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,312
I'm trying to stay true to my parents,

1246
01:27:10,408 --> 01:27:13,127
I haven't been true
to the one thing

1247
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,630
that means the most to me...

1248
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:26,265
...my brothers on the team.

1249
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:37,839
I'm sorry. I just, uh,
had to tell somebody, you know?

1250
01:27:50,457 --> 01:27:52,229
You're not gonna tell coach, are you?

1251
01:27:54,106 --> 01:27:56,504
That's not my job.

1252
01:27:58,485 --> 01:28:00,153
Right.

1253
01:28:07,766 --> 01:28:09,434
"Q" just came to see me.

1254
01:28:09,643 --> 01:28:11,728
Thanks for being
a positive influence on him.

1255
01:28:11,832 --> 01:28:14,335
- That's funny.
- No, no. It's true.

1256
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:19,965
And you gonna play him?

1257
01:28:22,572 --> 01:28:24,344
What do you think?

1258
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:27,472
Well...

1259
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,558
...he is a captain.

1260
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,520
And he scores most of our points.

1261
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,440
Might not win without him.

1262
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:39,985
Glad I'm not the coach right now.

1263
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:42,280
I'm glad I'm not Quentin's father
right now.

1264
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,678
He just flew in for the finals.

1265
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:55,000
When I was 13,

1266
01:28:55,105 --> 01:28:59,067
my father went with me
to a father-and-son dinner.

1267
01:29:01,048 --> 01:29:05,322
It was the only time he ever went
with me to anything like that.

1268
01:29:05,532 --> 01:29:06,366
One time.

1269
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:14,604
I never knew if he cared.

1270
01:29:14,604 --> 01:29:19,817
I took his absence
as a lack of love.

1271
01:29:19,913 --> 01:29:23,675
I never felt like I was good enough.
Never felt like I measured up.

1272
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:29,514
And it took me 40 years
to forgive him.

1273
01:29:30,035 --> 01:29:31,911
And when you got arrested...

1274
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:38,585
...I told the lovely Mrs. Gelwix,
"It's time to retire".

1275
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:44,322
Then I got a call from your father.

1276
01:29:45,364 --> 01:29:49,117
It was the first time we talked
since that 1986 season.

1277
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:52,975
And he said that the son
he lost a year ago

1278
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:56,103
wasn't the same one
he found sitting in jail.

1279
01:29:57,459 --> 01:30:00,169
You're where I was 40 years ago.

1280
01:30:01,421 --> 01:30:06,009
Don't spend another minute
being angry about yesterday.

1281
01:30:06,105 --> 01:30:08,408
Free him, and you free yourself.

1282
01:30:14,248 --> 01:30:16,229
Better get some sleep.

1283
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:19,878
Big game tomorrow.

1284
01:30:21,859 --> 01:30:23,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

1285
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,612
bringing in the game ball
for this years championship

1286
01:30:25,612 --> 01:30:27,801
is New Zealand's rugby
living legend,

1287
01:30:27,906 --> 01:30:30,825
Mr. Sid Going.

1288
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,371
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

1289
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:35,517
It's good to see you.

1290
01:30:35,517 --> 01:30:36,143
Sid, how are you?

1291
01:30:36,248 --> 01:30:38,438
Very good.
Good to see you, Larry.

1292
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:40,211
We're coming to you live today

1293
01:30:40,316 --> 01:30:42,714
from beautiful
Colorado Springs, Colorado,

1294
01:30:42,714 --> 01:30:45,737
where today two familiar teams
are taking the field --

1295
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,614
Flagstaff versus Highland --

1296
01:30:47,718 --> 01:30:51,262
the winning team walking away
with the national championship.

1297
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:52,410
Rick!

1298
01:30:52,515 --> 01:30:55,225
- Hey, Emily!
- Hey.

1299
01:30:55,225 --> 01:30:56,684
It's really good to see you.

1300
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:02,107
I wanted to say thank you
for what you did for "Q".

1301
01:31:02,211 --> 01:31:05,548
He said you took the time
to listen, and you're a real friend.

1302
01:31:05,756 --> 01:31:06,903
He said that?

1303
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:10,971
Well, you're welcome.

1304
01:31:13,682 --> 01:31:17,748
Well, I'll be right there,

1305
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:20,668
sitting in the Rick Penning
fan section.

1306
01:31:21,919 --> 01:31:23,587
I deserved that.

1307
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:25,568
Good luck.

1308
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,923
Thanks.

1309
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,658
See you after the game?

1310
01:31:32,763 --> 01:31:34,326
Uh, yeah.

1311
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:37,142
You can count on that.

1312
01:31:43,817 --> 01:31:46,319
- Hey, wrong bench, Penning.
- Look who it is.

1313
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:47,465
- Sweat it.
- What's up, traitor?

1314
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:49,133
- Rick.
- Welcome back.

1315
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,740
Hey, you don't belong
over here, traitor.

1316
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,623
You shouldn't be over here.

1317
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:05,087
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1318
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:11,031
I'm sorry for being a disappointment
to you and Mom.

1319
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:18,643
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be more
like what you wanted me to be.

1320
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,856
Son, uh...

1321
01:32:27,298 --> 01:32:29,070
It hasn't been just you.

1322
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:39,289
I also need to forgive you.

1323
01:32:42,313 --> 01:32:44,815
Kia kaha.

1324
01:32:50,446 --> 01:32:52,948
You will play your best game, right?

1325
01:32:52,948 --> 01:32:54,094
Let's go!

1326
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:59,622
Better stay on your toes, Rick.

1327
01:32:59,725 --> 01:33:02,019
There's 280 bucks on your head.

1328
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:04,313
You're going down and out, pal.

1329
01:33:09,318 --> 01:33:11,091
Why's he smiling?

1330
01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:15,158
Let's crack open his head
and find out.

1331
01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:40,600
Ka mate! Ka mate!

1332
01:33:40,705 --> 01:33:42,164
Ka ora! Ka ora!

1333
01:33:42,165 --> 01:33:44,980
Ka mate! Ka mate!
Ka ora! Ka ora!

1334
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:48,003
Tenei te tangata
Puhuru huru

1335
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:51,547
Nana i tiki mai
Whakawhiti te ra

1336
01:33:51,444 --> 01:33:53,843
A, upa... ne!
A, upa... ne!

1337
01:33:53,843 --> 01:33:58,742
A upane, ka upane
Whiti te ra... Hi!

1338
01:34:25,645 --> 01:34:26,688
Get it wide! Get it wide!

1339
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:42,641
At the 6:07 mark in the first half,

1340
01:34:42,746 --> 01:34:45,769
the score --
Highland, 5, Flagstaff, 0.

1341
01:34:59,951 --> 01:35:00,993
That was a cheap hit!

1342
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:03,392
- Keep the tackles low.
- Oh, come on!

1343
01:35:03,392 --> 01:35:04,538
Number 7, 10 in the bench.

1344
01:35:04,643 --> 01:35:05,372
Your attention please.

1345
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:08,291
Yellow-card caution issued
to Razorbacks number 7.

1346
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:19,450
Let's go! Support, support!

1347
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:44,117
Now, it's not really known
why Highland is going without

1348
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:46,725
their star fullback,
Quentin Owens today

1349
01:36:46,726 --> 01:36:47,767
but the loss, I'm telling you,

1350
01:36:47,976 --> 01:36:49,853
has got to be felt
by the rest of the team.

1351
01:37:01,635 --> 01:37:03,616
And that conversion
by Highland right there

1352
01:37:03,616 --> 01:37:04,658
ties us back up,

1353
01:37:04,868 --> 01:37:08,100
so it's Highland, 14,
Flagstaff, 14.

1354
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,559
It is anybody's game.

1355
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:13,732
Ruck over! Ruck over!

1356
01:37:13,732 --> 01:37:15,817
And Highland puts on the skills
and makes their move.

1357
01:37:15,922 --> 01:37:18,424
Oh, they get the turnover
and kick it out.

1358
01:37:18,528 --> 01:37:19,987
Cover the line! Cover the line!

1359
01:37:20,196 --> 01:37:22,594
And the line-out
goes to Arizona at the 22.

1360
01:37:24,054 --> 01:37:26,556
They're killing us out there, dude.
We've got to take Penning out.

1361
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:28,746
All right. You go high.

1362
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:29,996
Oh, yeah!

1363
01:37:30,102 --> 01:37:31,874
Straight line! Line it up!

1364
01:37:32,604 --> 01:37:33,855
Hey, hey, hey!

1365
01:37:33,855 --> 01:37:35,106
- Throw it to Penning.
- What?

1366
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:36,461
Get it right to him.

1367
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:39,381
Back to first jumper!

1368
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:41,466
Switch out on me.

1369
01:37:43,135 --> 01:37:46,994
Watch the ball! Watch the ball!
Watch it!

1370
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:11,809
- That'll be 10 minutes.
- Oh, come on!

1371
01:38:11,913 --> 01:38:12,852
Ten minutes!

1372
01:38:12,957 --> 01:38:14,417
That's a red card!

1373
01:38:14,731 --> 01:38:16,920
Colton, the Razorbacks
are getting off easy

1374
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,109
with a yellow card
and 10 minutes in the sin-bin.

1375
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:20,778
I tell you, if it were me,
I'd be sitting the kid.

1376
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:24,426
280, boy! 280!

1377
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:26,617
Marty!
You're out. Sit.

1378
01:38:26,617 --> 01:38:27,868
- What are you talking about?
- You're through.

1379
01:38:27,972 --> 01:38:29,118
Hey, come on.
We're gonna lose without Marty.

1380
01:38:29,223 --> 01:38:32,976
One more word out of you,
and you'll be sitting with him.

1381
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:36,834
Everybody stand back.
Let me check him out.

1382
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:38,190
Back off, guys. Back off.

1383
01:38:38,294 --> 01:38:40,275
Give him some room, okay?

1384
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:42,986
All right, take it easy, Rick.

1385
01:38:43,196 --> 01:38:44,447
Doc's gonna have a look at you, son.

1386
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:45,386
Okay, I'm gonna check your neck.

1387
01:38:45,491 --> 01:38:48,514
Just lay still. Lay still, okay?
You'll be okay.

1388
01:38:49,453 --> 01:38:50,704
I think he's gonna be okay.

1389
01:38:50,808 --> 01:38:55,082
Coach, uh, can I...?
Can I, um...?

1390
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:56,542
Thank you.

1391
01:39:02,486 --> 01:39:03,632
Hey.

1392
01:39:06,136 --> 01:39:09,055
Look, Rick,
you have a choice here.

1393
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:13,539
You either get up
and finish this game,

1394
01:39:13,539 --> 01:39:15,938
or you stay down...

1395
01:39:16,459 --> 01:39:17,918
...and you end up like me.

1396
01:40:05,257 --> 01:40:08,177
And he breaks
the line and turns on the power.

1397
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:10,784
He outsmarts them all
and takes it to the line,

1398
01:40:10,784 --> 01:40:14,328
so it's Highland, 19,
Flagstaff, 14.

1399
01:40:17,666 --> 01:40:19,647
And with time just under 5 minutes,

1400
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:22,566
it is still a toss-up
as to who will win this game.

1401
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:31,951
Come on, pass it out! Let's go!

1402
01:40:37,685 --> 01:40:39,458
Number 11's got the moves,

1403
01:40:39,459 --> 01:40:41,231
and he's got the 5 points!

1404
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,003
That is the third try for Arizona,

1405
01:40:43,108 --> 01:40:45,610
and the second try
for Lars Murphy in this game.

1406
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,383
Arizona's back in business!

1407
01:40:47,384 --> 01:40:50,303
That was the try that can
turn this entire game around.

1408
01:40:50,303 --> 01:40:51,658
Both teams are playing very well

1409
01:40:51,763 --> 01:40:53,848
under the extreme pressure
for the title.

1410
01:40:59,374 --> 01:41:02,397
Now this score has
guaranteed us a real cliffhanger

1411
01:41:02,398 --> 01:41:06,151
as we move into the last two
minutes of this intense match.

1412
01:41:37,851 --> 01:41:39,623
There we go! There we go!
Come on!

1413
01:41:50,363 --> 01:41:52,239
Go, Rick. Go, Rick!

1414
01:41:56,411 --> 01:41:57,766
Pick it up! Come on!

1415
01:42:04,336 --> 01:42:05,899
Go! Go, Rick!

1416
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:10,070
Run!

1417
01:42:18,412 --> 01:42:21,749
Penning is down at the try line
in a huge pileup!

1418
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:22,270
I can't see.

1419
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,668
We're still waiting
for the official to make the call.

1420
01:42:24,773 --> 01:42:27,900
Out of the away!
Move away. Let me see it.

1421
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:39,370
For the 16th time in 21 years,

1422
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:42,707
your USA Rugby National
High School Champion

1423
01:42:42,811 --> 01:42:44,687
is Highland.

1424
01:42:55,429 --> 01:42:57,514
That's the Rick Penning
I knew was in there!

1425
01:42:57,515 --> 01:42:59,391
Way to go, buddy! Way to go!

1426
01:42:59,496 --> 01:43:01,477
Hey! We did it!

1427
01:43:01,477 --> 01:43:04,396
That's how you make
your family proud, brah!

1428
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,822
Kia kaha, son.

1429
01:43:29,004 --> 01:43:31,923
Rick! Rick!

1430
01:43:32,132 --> 01:43:32,757
You did it!

1431
01:43:32,966 --> 01:43:34,217
Hey!

1432
01:43:34,322 --> 01:43:35,156
You did it!

1433
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,928
No. We did it.

1434
01:43:37,554 --> 01:43:39,743
Yay!

1435
01:43:41,725 --> 01:43:44,123
That was unbelievable!

1436
01:43:44,227 --> 01:43:44,644
For you.

1437
01:43:44,853 --> 01:43:45,895
No.

1438
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,146
For the team.

1439
01:43:47,146 --> 01:43:48,397
Feel good, huh?

1440
01:43:49,441 --> 01:43:50,170
Coach...

1441
01:43:56,949 --> 01:43:58,200
Nice game.

1442
01:43:59,243 --> 01:44:00,702
Nice game, Richard.

1443
01:44:14,883 --> 01:44:17,699
Hey,
that was a beautiful play, brah.

1444
01:44:17,803 --> 01:44:18,740
Hey, what is this for?

1445
01:44:18,845 --> 01:44:20,201
Season's over, buddy!

1446
01:44:20,306 --> 01:44:21,453
What are you talking about?

1447
01:44:21,558 --> 01:44:22,704
Oh, ho, ho!

1448
01:44:22,809 --> 01:44:25,727
Hey, Griggs, you gotta pay
the price for victory, baby!

1449
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:26,875
Whoo!

1450
01:44:26,979 --> 01:44:27,708
Oh!

1451
01:44:28,752 --> 01:44:29,898
I'll only do it for you guys.

1452
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:31,462
I promise, I'll only do it for you.

1453
01:44:35,008 --> 01:44:37,301
Best bath I ever had!
