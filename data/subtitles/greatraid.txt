<i>Man: In 1941.
The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.</i>

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>The US fleet was crippled.</i>

3
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,448
<i>Ten hours later. Across the Pacific.
They attacked the Philippines.</i>

4
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,543
<i>Clearing the way for
an overwhelming invasion of the islands.</i>

<i>Radio announcer: Japan has undertaken
a surprise offense...</i>

6

<i>Man: US forces.
Including 10.000 Americans</i>

7
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,720
<i>and 60.000 Filipinos.</i>

8
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,061
<i>Pull back to the Bataan Peninsula.</i>

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,701
<i>Without a navy to rescue them
and with their backs to the sea.</i>

10
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,467
<i>They're trapped.</i>

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,074
<i>Despite promises to the contrary.</i>

12
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,740
<i>President Roosevelt
and his military high command</i>

13
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,079
<i>decide to focus first on Europe.</i>

14
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,711
<i>And on stopping Hitler.</i>

15
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,780
<i>This strategy effectively
seals the fate of the Philippines</i>

16
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,088
<i>and the men trapped on Bataan.</i>

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,355
<i>Under orders and against his wishes.</i>

18
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,332
<i>General MacArthur escapes to Australia.</i>

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,561
<i>Vowing to return.</i>

20
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,639

of fighting without supplies.</i>

00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,505
<i>Starving American and Filipino troops</i>

<i>surrender to the Japanese Imperial Army.</i>

23
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,148
<i>It is the largest single defeat</i>

24
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,108
<i>in the history of the American military.</i>

25
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,778

<i>Unequipped to house or feed

28
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:14,525
<i>The Japanese take the weakened soldiers
on a brutal 60-mile forced march.</i>

29
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,104
<i>Men who fall out of line
are bayoneted or shot.</i>

30
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:26,169
<i>15.000 perish on what would become
known as the Bataan Death March.</i>

31

<i>at O'Donnell.
Cabanatuan and Palawan.</i>

33
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,215
<i>The Japanese guards.
Who view surrender as a disgrace.</i>

34
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,193
<i>Treat them viciously.</i>

35
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,957
<i>Thousands die from disease.</i>

36
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,898
<i>Starvation and abuse.</i>

37
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,330
<i>By 1944. however.</i>

38
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,140
<i>The tide of battle changes.</i>

39
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,976
<i>With each new victory.
American forces advance on Japan.</i>

40
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:07,851
<i>And with each new defeat. The
Japanese army becomes more desperate.</i>

41
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:13,382
<i>Fueled by propaganda. They believe
that the Americans will show no mercy.</i>

42
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,689
<i>The government in Tokyo
encourages these fears.</i>

43
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:23,430
<i>Convincing its people they must prepare
to defend their country to the death.</i>

44
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,768
<i>On August 1. 1944.</i>

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,676
<i>The Tokyo war ministry
releases a memo</i>

46
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:35,238
<i>dictating the Japanese army's policy
toward prisoners of war.</i>

47
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,442
<i>It reads:</i>

48
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:42,352
<i>"It is the aim not to allow the escape
of a single one.</i>

49
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,449
<i>"To annihilate them all.
And not leave any traces. "</i>

50
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,188
<i>(Shouts orders in Japanese)</i>

51
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,221
Go! Go, go!

52
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,336

<i>Man: The landing at Lingayen Gulf</i>

<i>was the largest naval operation
ever undertaken in the Pacific.</i>

56
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,341
<i>Over a quarter million troops
came ashore.</i>

57
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,910
<i>Ready for the final push
into the Philippines.</i>

58
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,754
<i>I was a Stanford graduate who'd
entered the service through the R. O. T. C.</i>

59
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,760
<i>I wasn't interested
in being a career soldier.</i>

60
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,594
<i>I just wanted to do my part
and go home to my wife.</i>

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,733
<i>I was a captain
with the 6th Ranger battalion.</i>

62
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:14,467
<i>My commanding officer
was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci.</i>

63
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,532
<i>(Swing music)</i>

64
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,837
- You in this hand, Lieutenant?
- Thinking about it, Colonel.

65
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,680
Well, if you're thinking about it,
you already lost.

66
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:29,654
- Want me to give you a better look?
- No, Colonel, I don't want you...

67
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,683
<i>A West Point graduate. Mucci was
one of the most driven men I'd ever met.</i>

68
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,662
<i>He took on what seemed to many
like a hopeless task -</i>

69
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,326
<i>the job of turning a group of raw.
Untested recruits</i>

70
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,393
<i>into a new unit of elite soldiers.</i>

71
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,962
<i>Originally assigned to handle livestock.</i>

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,942
<i>They were mostly farm hands
from small towns in rural areas</i>

73
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,411
<i>with little or no combat experience.</i>

74
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,211
First Sergeant, overlays are ready.
Have you seen Colonel Mucci?

75
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,185
Yes, sir.
He's in the Waldorf, playing poker.

76
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,587
Wouldn't interrupt him right now.
I think he's losing.

77
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:09,561
Ah, for cryin' out loud. Lieutenant Foley,
get me a new deck. This one's unlucky.

78
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,530
When you stick that pipe in your mouth,
I know you're in trouble.

79
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,897
Just you wait,
you smug son of a bitch.

80
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,562
Colonel, overlays.

81
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,969
Any idea who that is?

82
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,035
<i>- No, sir.
- (Mucci) Corporal of the guard.</i>

83
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:29,105
- Yes, sir.
- Aliteri, find out who the cowboy is.

84
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,513
Sir.

85
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,155
<i>We'd spent months training
and had seen very little action.</i>

86
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,250
<i>As far as the army was concerned.</i>

87
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,263
<i>We were nothing more
than the colonel's personal experiment.</i>

88
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,822
<i>Mucci was determined
to prove them wrong.</i>

89
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,668
- General.
- Henry.

90
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,469
You know Colonel White,
and this is Major Lapham.

91
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,342
Major, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Mucci, CO, 6th Ranger battalion.

92
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,575
Major Lapham is a stay-behind
from the Bataan campaign.

93
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,277
He runs guerrilla units here
in north-central Luzon.

94
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:10,255
Philippine guerrillas have been the primary
source of intel for MacArthur since the fall.

95
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,985
- It's an honor, Major.
- Thank you.

96
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:17,519
Major Lapham,
tell Colonel Mucci what you told us.

97
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,293
Five miles east
of Cabanatuan City here,

98
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:25,327
there's a Japanese POW camp holding
about 500 survivors of the death march.

99
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,771
As we advance on this area,

100
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,504
I believe the Japanese will murder
the prisoners rather than release them.

101
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:36,015
Major Lapham is probably right. There
was an incident in a camp on Palawan.

102
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,916
150 American POWs were herded
into air-raid shelters and burnt alive

103
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,454
on the news that MacArthur had invaded.

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,355
Our axis of advance
is headed right for that camp.

105
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,893
Unless we run into
something unexpected,

106
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,364
we're gonna be in Cabanatuan at the
end of the week, and that may be too late.

107
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,128
Horton, what's G2 got to say about this?

108
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,262
Because of our advances, Jap movements
have become increasingly fluid -

109
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,775
retreating at night, hiding during the day
to avoid our aircraft.

110
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,902
What that means is we can't be sure
where the enemy is.

111
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,106
They're only 30 miles
from our front lines.

112
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,948
There's over 30,000 Japanese troops
in that area alone, Colonel.

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,614
Henry, you develop a plan
and get it to the G3 by the morning.

114
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,022
<i>- Sir.
- (General) I'll make my decision then.</i>

115
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,157
Henry, I'll be honest with you. This mission
appeals more to my heart than to my head.

116
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,961
Three years ago
we ordered these men to surrender.

117
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,229
The way I see it, we owe them a great debt.

118
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,569
But... I need you
to be a hard-headed pragmatist.

119
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,701
If it doesn't feel right,
you call it off. Understand?

120
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,835
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,073
- Who will you assign it to?
- I'll lead it myself.

122
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,980
Let the rest of your battalion worry about it.

123
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
I trained these Rangers. Everything
I've asked them to do, I've done myself.

124
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,280
I feel like they deserve a shot at this.

125
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,326
And so do I.

126
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,884
All right, Henry.
You show me a plan that works.

127
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,224
Sir.

128
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,756
General Krueger
hasn't made up his mind yet,

129
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,598
so I need you to come up
with a hell of a plan.

130
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,697
The Alamo Scouts are briefing us in five.
After that, you've got till the morning.

131
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,401
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,104
Sir, when you said
you were going to accompany us...

133
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,808
Don't worry, Captain.
You'll be leading the raid, not me.

134
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,908
<i>(Captain) How many guards
in the compound?</i>

135
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,444
<i>- Man: Could be as many as 200.
- (Captain) Any tanks?</i>

136
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:28,358
This building with the metal roof
looks like it's protecting something.

137
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:35,525
If the camp is here, what is the Japanese
strength inside Cabanatuan City?

138
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:40,232
- 9,000 troops, sir.
- Not to worry. That's over four miles away.

139
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,003
What's enemy traffic like on this road?

140
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,012
The Japanese are moving their troops
from south to north.

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,709
So this is one of their main routes.

142
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,185
Looks like this bridge
is a mile away from the camp.

143
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,243
Half a mile, sir.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,518
We believe it's heavily fortified. We're
not sure how many troops are guarding it.

145
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,755
Sir, it's hard to determine the number of
men we'll need without more specific intel.

146
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,266
Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury,
Bob. I selected you for your flexibility.

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,530
Now, you've got
a 24-hour jump on us, Lieutenant.

148
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,004
Is that enough time to get Captain Prince
all the dope he needs?

149
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:18,135
We'll be ready to report to you at 0800
hours on the morning of the 29th, sir.

150
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>- (Mucci) Get it done.
- (Men) Yes, sir.</i>

151
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,476
Sir, the tough nut is the final approach.

152
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,112
No cover for over 800 yards.

153
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,089
It's as flat as a pancake.

154
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,236
Hey. Hey!

155
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,499
<i>(Whimpers)</i>

156
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,008
How far do you think
Hewitt's got by now?

157
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,952
What difference does it make?

158
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,422
The Japs are gonna catch him
sooner or later.

159
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,864
You couldn't have got me
something easier to chew?

160
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,598
A mango, banana?

161
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,869
Duke's selling graveyard rats,
but I thought...

162
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,105
I thought that'd be overindulging.

163
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,513
Is it your gums
or your teeth hurting?

164
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,847
<i>(Groans)</i>

165
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,718
Starts at the gums, works its way
around the back of my head

166
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,555
and then ends up
in my neck somewhere.

167
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,720
Don't worry.
It's not malaria.

168
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,125
- Sir.
- Take a knee, Lieutenant.

169
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,393
We've just translated
a telegram to Colonel Mori.

170
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,201
MacArthur's conquered the southern
islands. He's landed here on Luzon.

171
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,540
Good ol' Dugout Doug.
He can take in the sun for a few days,

172
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,706
then head on back to Australia
like he did the first time.

173
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,809
The information's good, Major.
I'm in that office every day.

174
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:44,983
We don't know how close MacArthur is
or when he'll reach Cabanatuan.

175
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,452
Tell the men the best thing to do is sit tight
and stay calm till we find out more.

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,361
Yes, sir.

177
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,260
- Make sure McMahon gets that.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,998
<i>(POW) Come on, get up!</i>

179
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,575
<i>- Come on, get up!
- (Guard speaks Japanese)</i>

180
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,305
- They caught Hewitt.
- Who was watchin' him?

181
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,419
Poor dumb bastard
couldn't even wait till it got dark.

182
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,786
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

183
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,226
<i>(Speaks Japanese)</i>

184
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,035
<i>(Hewitt yells)</i>

185
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,808
<i>(Japanese) You are responsible for this.</i>

186
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,983
You surrender like cowards,
then you run away like dogs.

187
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,616
He'll die, because none of you
had the courage to stop him!

188
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,425
<i>(Whipping continues. Hewitt yells)</i>

189
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>(Japanese)</i>

190
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,132
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

191
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,220
Redding.

192
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,526
<i>(Speaks Japanese) I need food.</i>

193
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,903
<i>(Grunts)</i>

194
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,843
Colvin, watch his back.

195
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,415
- How much?
- Five.

196
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,037
- You should not have come.
- Neither should you.

197
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,268
<i>(Guard yells in Japanese)</i>

198
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,771
<i>(POWcries out in pain)</i>

199
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,375
The guards are getting
harder to bribe.

200
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,074
What we really need is more medicine.

201
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,282
Carlos and my father were questioned
by the Japanese last week.

202
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,381
They are watching us.

203
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,824
Then tell Margaret
not to take any more risks.

204
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,158
<i>(Speaks Filipino)
You think she'll listen?</i>

205
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,698
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

206
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,759
Is there anything else
you want me to tell her?

207
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,274
Just to take care.

208
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:54,439
There is some quinine in the peanuts.
Take some yourself, huh?

209
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,540
You don't look well.

210
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,815
<i>(Colvin) Who's Margaret, Red?</i>

211
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,092
She's an American nurse who was married
to his commanding officer.

212
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,464
He died of malaria about a year ago
in one of the other camps.

213
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,061
<i>- (Colvin) Is the major involved with her?
- (Redding) What makes you ask?</i>

214
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,936
<i>(Colvin) Nothing.</i>

215
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,141
He just sounded concerned.

216
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:30,041
Well, he wasn't involved with her,
but he should have been.

217
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,710
Her husband
didn't give a damn about her,

218
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,619
<i>and Gibby couldn't give a damn
about anyone else but her.</i>

219
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,250
- Why didn't he do something about it?
- 'Cause he's a gentleman.

220
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,090
He'd never fool around
with another man's wife.

221
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,289
I, on the other hand, might.

222
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,899
<i>(Colvin) Where is she now?</i>

223
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,061
<i>(Redding) She's still in Manila.</i>

224
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,368
Who do you think smuggles
all the medicine into the camp?

225
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:07,148
<i>(Prince) In 1941. Manila was considered
the pearl of the Orient.</i>

226
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,214
<i>An international city where people
from all over the world lived and worked.</i>

227
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,727
<i>That all changed
when the Japanese took over.</i>

228
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,127
<i>They believed
that as a conquered people.</i>

229
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,927
<i>The Filipinos should do
as they were told.</i>

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,495
<i>Those who disobeyed were jailed.
Tortured or executed.</i>

231
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,838
This made the bond between the Filipinos
and the Americans even stronger.

232
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,902
<i>Resistance grew throughout the country.</i>

233
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,418
<i>By 1945. hundreds of ordinary people
had joined the underground.</i>

234
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,683
It's like they have been
watching me for weeks.

235
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,149
The Japanese
have questioned our people before.

236
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,854
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

237
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,160
They know
that the Americans are closing in,

238
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,328
and they know that we have evidence
of their war crimes.

239
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,702
Don Antonio is right. This...

240
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,333
This wasn't like before, Margaret.

241
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,970
Now they know of things
only an informer could have told them.

242
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,140
Then why'd they let you go?

243
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm sorry, Carlos,
but if you're worried, you're free to go.

244
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,212
I won't hold it against you.

245
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,987
I won't hold it against any of you.

246
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,989
I wouldn't leave unless we all go.

247
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,624
You know that.

248
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:34,731
I can't leave, not as long as there is
a single prisoner left in Cabanatuan.

249
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,467
<i>(Speaks Filipino)
...Margaret.</i>

250
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,445
I saw Daniel.

251
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,675
How is he?

252
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,217
He did not look well.

253
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,651
I think he has malaria again.

254
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:53,988
I know my father said to wait, but
if we do that, it may be too late for Daniel.

255
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,362
No, your father's right.
It's too dangerous. Don't listen to me.

256
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:05,098
No. I will meet you outside the hospital
in the usual place, OK?

257
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,332
I should go.

258
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,475
Company... atten-hut!

259
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,577
At ease.

260
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,279
I'm here to tell you men
the latrine rumors are true.

261
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,122
We've finally got a mission
worthy of Rangers.

262
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,588
We're going to push right through
our front lines into the Japs' backyard

263
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:37,796
and rescue 500 American prisoners of war.

264
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,566
It's going to be a rough son of a bitch.

265
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,541
A textbook-style raid
that can only succeed

266
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,012
through speed, surprise
and overwhelming firepower.

267
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,548
That's why you've been chosen.

268
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,084
Before you start congratulating yourselves,

269
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,713
remember that you haven't achieved
a damn thing yet.

270
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,123
You're the best-trained,
least-proven battalion in this whole army.

271
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,924
This is your one chance
to do something about it.

272
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,295
And I mean one chance.

273
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,563
How you acquit yourselves
over the next 48 hours

274
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,470
will determine how you are judged
for the rest of your lives.

275
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,208
Men worthy of serving in this army,

276
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:24,739
or an embarrassment that history and time
will eventually forget.

277
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,147
It's up to you.

278
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,711
Now, I happen to think it's the former.

279
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,282
That's why I'm accompanying you
on this raid.

280
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,320
There's not another group of men in this or
any other army I'd sooner trust my life with.

281
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:43,835
You're the finest, best-prepared soldiers
this country's ever sent to war,

282
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,894
and I expect you to prove it.

283
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,366
One final thing:

284
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:53,879
I wanna see every last one of you
in the chapel after this formation's over.

285
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:58,178
I do not want any damned atheists
on this raid.

286
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,877
And no fakers either.

287
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:04,855
I want you to get down on your knees
and swear before Almighty God

288
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:09,020
that you'll give your lives
before you let any of those prisoners die.

289
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,855
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

290
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,763
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir!

291
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,095
Carry on.

292
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,502
Company... atten-hut!

293
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,776
The general liked your plan.

294
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:31,713
<i>(Chaplain)... and build an enduring peace
founded upon thy holy laws,</i>

295
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:35,550
and upon that unselfish goodwill
to all those who love justice and peace

296
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,785
which thou hast given unto us through
Jesus Christ, thine only son, our Lord.

297
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,385
<i>- Amen.
- (All) Amen.</i>

298
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,957
Take charge of your platoon!

299
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,128
Can't believe the colonel said
don't wear no insignia.

300
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,867
He's got that pencil mustache. Even
the Nips are gonna know he's an officer.

301
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,806
- Shut up.
- I mean, I can wear my helmet.

302
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,311
Come on. I use it to cook, to clean, to wash.

303
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,904
Yeah, the helmets,
they make too much noise,

304
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,950
out in the field.

305
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,248
- Sorry, I didn't hear that, Aldrige. Did you?
- I heard him.

306
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:15,484
Aldrige, you're the best shot
in the company. Ever fire one of these?

307
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,051
No.

308
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,293
- No, sir. I like my M-1.
- Choose yourself a loader.

309
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,825
Lucas.

310
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,802
- Sure about that?
- Yeah.

311
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,479
Rookies.

312
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,538
<i>(Soldiers singing)</i>

313
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,246
<i>(Radio)... Japanese planes have struck
at six different points in the Philippines.</i>

314
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,984
<i>Manila is 13 hours ahead
of Eastern Standard Time.</i>

315
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,753
<i>It is reported that Japanese bombs...</i>

316
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,818
First Sergeant.

317
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:55,159
- So you really are going.
- Someone told me you had the same idea.

318
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah.

319
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,470
Look, Jim,
I'm already taking four of your men.

320
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,532
All fine combat medics, Henry.

321
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,071
But if we get hit hard, you're gonna need
someone who can operate.

322
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,514
I can't miss this, Henry.

323
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,512
It's why I'm here.

324
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:24,791
Besides, sometimes a young field medic
needs his surgeon around.

325
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,891
Just like a young company commander
needs his colonel.

326
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,465
You win.

327
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,573
Captain, you got a minute for me?

328
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,642
Sure, Top.

329
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:57,522
I was going over the personnel roster,
and I ain't on it.

330
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,360
Colonel Mucci said he preferred
unmarried men on this trip,

331
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,366
so I had to take you off.

332
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,232
Well, with respect, sir, you're married.

333
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,638
And I imagine your wife would miss you
a hell of a lot more than mine'd miss me.

334
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:14,770
I'm the one planning this raid, Top.
Don't make me go against my instructions.

335
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,078
I'm not, sir. I'm asking you
to be a smart company commander.

336
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,320
We got Rangers out there that ain't heard
the first round go downrange in combat yet.

337
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,885
You need me on this mission.

338
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,861
Just think you need something
on that jungle rot.

339
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:36,764
Top, when I was in R.O.T.C., I was four
weeks away from being shipped to Bataan.

340
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,532
I was held back
by an impacted wisdom tooth.

341
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,404
Guys I knew ended up in those camps.

342
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,067
I think I can live with defeat.

343
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:51,876
That may be, but you're gonna find it
a lot harder to live without me.

344
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,789
All right, I'll talk to the colonel.

345
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,587
- Anything else, First Sergeant?
- No, sir.

346
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,457
Thank you. Good night, sir.

347
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:15,102
(Prince) We left 6th Army Headquarters
with very little information.

348
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:19,474
<i>The only advantage we had
was the element of surprise.</i>

349
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,539
<i>We faced a two-day walk through
open terrain patrolled by the enemy.</i>

350
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,813
<i>All it would take
is a single Japanese scout to spot us</i>

351
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,013
<i>and our mission would be over.</i>

352
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,489
Let's go! Riley, load 'em up!

353
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,757
Pack 'em up! Let's move!

354
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,263
Move 'em out!

355
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,597
<i>We all knew the idealistic notion
of rescuing POWs</i>

356
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,900
<i>far outweighted its strategic value.</i>

357
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,135
<i>We didn't spent much time
thinking about it.</i>

358
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,509
<i>As far as we were concerned.
We were going to rescue them</i>

359
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,242
<i>or die trying.</i>

360
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,650
- They're gonna just leave us, sir?
- I have no idea what they're doing.

361
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:13,188
Get this quinine to the doctors.
You know the drill - worst cases first.

362
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:22,906
They must be retreating.
Even the brass is leaving.

363
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,001
Hey, Major, Mori's leaving too.

364
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:36,185
Looks like you were right.
General MacArthur's got 'em on the run.

365
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,747
They're not on the run. They've got orders
to fight to the last man.

366
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,792
It's a trap.

367
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,295
A goddamn elaborate one.

368
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,966
We walk out those gates,
it'll give 'em the perfect excuse to kill us.

369
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,128
Since when did they need an excuse?

370
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,765
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
out of here before they change their minds.

371
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,571
How far do you think you'll get, Captain?

372
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,943
Even if the Japs are retreating,
the jungle's gonna be crawling with 'em.

373
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,539
What's wrong with that?
We're still soldiers, ain't we?

374
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:09,110
Major's right, Red. Where we gonna go
when most of us can't walk?

375
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,055
I don't recall inviting you, kid.

376
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,354
What happens
to the ones we leave behind?

377
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,486
I never said we'd all make it,
but at least some of us might.

378
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,031
If we sit tight, all of us will make it.

379
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,465
Our troops can't be far now.

380
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,002
Looks like you got yourself
a disciple, Gibby.

381
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,334
It might do you some good
to listen to him.

382
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,404
They're out there, Red.
Don't make it any easier for 'em.

383
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,852
Don't worry, I won't escape
without your permission.

384
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,781
Get the padre, Duke.

385
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,721
Poor son of a bitch still believed in God.

386
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,665
Well, if we can't escape,
we might as well eat.

387
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,647
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

388
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:08,264
Where do you think Mori sits?
I'll take a shit on his plate.

389
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,763
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- I wasn't always this sane.

390
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,517
- What's the matter?
- These food parcels were meant for us.

391
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,054
The bastards
were starving us deliberately.

392
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,085
Make sure you get some
to the men in the hospital ward.

393
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,569
Easy, Red.
Your stomach ain't used to it.

394
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,939
What do I care? Feels like
I'm sucking on Rita Hayworth's tits.

395
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,672
I was thinking more Mae West.

396
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:46,532
- What is it, Top?
- Japs. Only left a few hours ago.

397
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,997
Must have been hiding from our planes.

398
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,876
There's no telling where they are now. We
might wanna look around before we go on.

399
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,779
They're retreating, Captain.
That's all we need to know.

400
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,682
- Let's go.
- Move out.

401
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,188
- Platoons, let's go.
- Charlie Two, to the left.

402
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,417
Let's go, Charlie One. Follow me.

403
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,502
(tanks approaching)

404
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,388
Damn it.

405
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,919
They're Kempei Tai.
I think they're heading towards the camp.

406
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,861
The river branches out
about a half mile to the east of us.

407
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:53,701
It's not marked. There might be a bridge
that can get us around this convoy.

408
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,674
The Japanese will be guarding
a major artery at a chokepoint like that.

409
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,107
I think we ought to check it out.
This traffic isn't getting any thinner.

410
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,812
Go.

411
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,518
It was thanks to me
you met Margaret in the first place.

412
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,155
Sure it was.

413
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:23,031
When I look up at the sky like this,
I could be anywhere in the world.

414
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,628
- Where are you now?
- Halfway across the jungle.

415
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,836
I disobeyed your orders, and now
I'm only a few miles from civilization.

416
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,435
Well, have a drink for me
when you get there.

417
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,913
What do you want me
to tell Margaret?

418
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,408
Assuming she's still interested.

419
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:45,513
Well, if she's not, I'll propose to her myself,
and you know what?

420
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,186
I'll make you best man,
'cause I know you won't run off with her.

421
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:55,632
If I had someone like that waiting for me
on the other side of an open gate...

422
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,601
<i>- That's not regular army.
- ((Daniel) They're Kempei Tai.</i>

423
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,077
Military secret police.

424
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,457
<i>((Japanese)</i>

425
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,826
Don't...
give them the satisfaction.

426
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,953
<i>((Japanese) They'll be dead soon.</i>

427
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:29,358
<i>- ((shouts command in Japanese)
- ((guards shout)</i>

428
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,253
<i>((speaks Japanese)</i>

429
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,778
You fought in Bataan, Major?

430
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,547
You commanded a battalion of the 31 st
Infantry in operations near Mamala River?

431
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,622
I can give you my name,
rank and serial number.

432
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,229
We found these in your barracks.

433
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:54,238
I assume they were smuggled in
by the Filipino resistance.

434
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,448
They say, "Take hope.

435
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,851
"MacArthur is coming."

436
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:07,187
We've lived off rumors like that
for three years.

437
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,625
Only this time they are true.

438
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,792
Your forces will recapture the Philippines
within a few weeks.

439
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,300
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it isn't long to wait.

440
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,365
You are the senior officer.

441
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,967
If you help me keep order,

442
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:30,606
I can make the rest
of your time here tolerable.

443
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:37,885
But if any of the prisoners try to escape,
I will kill ten others in his place.

444
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,689
Are you married, Major?

445
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,532
- No.
- You have a reason to survive this war?

446
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,802
I'd like to be here for your surrender.

447
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,972
Then you had better stay in good health.

448
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,846
You look feverish.

449
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,885
Some quinine would help.

450
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,629
Will that be all?

451
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,171
<i>- ((speaks Japanese)

452
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,316

00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,734

454
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,674
<i>- ((murmurs)
- Hey.</i>

455
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,573
Hey.

456
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,708
You were delirious.

457
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,910
- Wittinghill thinks it's malignant malaria.
- How long is he giving me?

458
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:16,044
Three or four days
unless we get you more quinine.

459
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,386
He tried to convince me
to send you to St. Peter's ward.

460
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,857
Oh, you're my next of kin now?

461
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:27,387
Hey, it's no joke. You die on me,
what's to stop me leaving this place?

462
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,397
I told you what Nagai said.

463
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:35,565
- Stay out of trouble. It will soon be over.
- The problem is I don't believe Nagai.

464
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,665
Which part don't you believe?

465
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,472
Ten of us getting killed
for every one that escapes?

466
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,606
That's the reason I didn't want to make
any friends here - in case I let 'em down.

467
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:48,618
Unfortunately, you
I was stuck with from before.

468
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,682
You gotta pull through this, pal.

469
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,624
Just think of everything
you got to look forward to.

470
00:39:55,693 --> 00:40:00,528
Think of Margaret in a see-through
cheongsam walking on your back.

471
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,299
- You ever gonna stop?
- No.

472
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,273
Come on, you bastard.
Pull out of it.

473
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,152
20mls of iodine, please.

474
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,059
Thanks.

- Is it just him?
- I think so.

487
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,348
Mina, I have to get you out of here.

488
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,317
The quinine's in the bag.
Pack your things and leave.

489
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:52,083
- No, I'm not leaving...
- Mina, leave!

490
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,648
Try to get the medicine to Cabanatuan.
If you can't, head for the mountains.

- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

492
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,559
Go.

493
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,401
What are you doing?

494
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:36,523
<i>- ((Mucci) Balincarin?
- ((Prince) Yes, sir.</i>

495
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,101
Let's get some people in there.

496
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,696
Top?

497
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,681
- All clear.
- What is it, Top?

498
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,588
Tanks.

499
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,034
<i>((screams in distance)</i>

500
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,406
You better go get the colonel.

501
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,543
Yeah, Top.

502
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:38,393
Bob, hang back a little.
Let me walk ahead.

503
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,625
<i>((speaking Filipino)</i>

504
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,941
<i>((speaking Filipino)</i>

505
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,218
- Captain Juan Pajota.
- Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci,

506
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,884
CO, 6th Ranger battalion.

507
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,191
Sir.

508
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,629
What happened here?

509
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,500
The Japanese came into the village
yesterday, with tanks,

510
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,767
to punish these people
for helping my men.

511
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,765
Over a hundred were killed.

512
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,713
Captain, I guarantee you,
this will not go unpunished.

513
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,636
Alamo Scouts. Hold your fire.

514
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,835
<i>- Charlie Company CO.
- ('soldier) This way. Follow me.</i>

515
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,072
The camp is divided into quarters.

516
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,742
We only spotted POWs
in the southeast quadrant here.

517
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,945
The Jap guard barracks
are here in this area.

518
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,147
There are sentries
in each guard tower,

519
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,385
two at the gates,
five in the guardhouses.

520
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:52,919
We couldn't get precise numbers. Could
be anything between 50 and 100 of 'em.

521
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,830
This isn't enough, sir.

522
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,698
- Enough of what?
- There's too many unknowns.

523
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,330
There's a big difference
between 50 and 100 men.

524
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,843
It isn't always about the arithmetic.
Some things you gotta take on faith.

525
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,379
We get into firefight
inside that compound,

526
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:14,544
and a lot of those men we're trying
to rescue are liable to get killed.

527
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:19,413
Lieutenant Able,
you've got 12 hours till this raid kicks off.

528
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,618
Can you get in there
and bring back more detailed intel?

529
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,527
It's dicey, sir. All that open terrain
in broad daylight.

530
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:29,293
We need more time.
Give them a chance to work in closer.

531
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,460
No more delays now, goddammit.

532
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:36,302
Those poor bastards have had three years
of delays. We'll stick to your plan, Bob.

533
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,535
With respect, sir,

534
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,043
you said you chose me
for my flexibility.

535
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:46,709
Under present circumstances, I cannot
guarantee the safety of those prisoners.

536
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,685
Sir, you may be forced to delay.

537
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,213
Why, Captain?

538
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,191
There's a Japanese convoy
traveling north, division strength.

539
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,785
They will pass
directly in front of the camp tonight.

540
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,923
How is it you came by this information,
Captain Pajota?

541
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,092
From our spies in Cabanatuan City.

542
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,728
Are we talking hard facts
or the bamboo telegraph?

543
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:12,572
The bamboo telegraph told me you
and your men are coming here today, sir.

544
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,815
Lieutenant Able, get some of our own
people on this. As of now we leave tonight.

545
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:23,080
Sir.

546
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,181
<i>('Able) Captain?</i>

547
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,387
You heard the colonel.
Do what you can.

548
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,724
Yes, sir.

549
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,458
<i>('speaks Filipino)</i>

550
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,898
Captain?

551
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,835
You have a minute? I wanted
to discuss this plan with you.

552
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:44,272
My men have been watching
this camp for three years.

553
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,310
We planned to raid it
many times ourselves.

554
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:51,246
- Why didn't you?
- Most of your POWs can't walk.

555
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,943
They're either sick or crippled.

556
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:57,419
The healthy ones were shipped
to labor camps in Japan.

557
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:01,151
If we rescued them,
how would we care for them?

558
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,054
Well, how did you plan
to move them from the camp?

559
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,064
In carabao carts.

560
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,600
You have enough carts
for 500 prisoners?

561
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:14,126
If you give me 24 hours, I will.

562
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:20,637
But... you have to convince your colonel
to move to another village.

563
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,578
It isn't safe to bring them here.

564
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,083
What village do you suggest?

565
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,415
Platero.

566
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,687
Sir.

567
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,965
Sorry if I was out of line before.

568
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,698
- I spoke to Captain Pajota...
- We'll delay 24 hours.

569
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,263
Get a message to General Krueger.

570
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,572
That'll be all.

571
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,475
Yes, sir.

572
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,583
<i>('knock at door)</i>

573
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,691
Margaret Utinsky?

574
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,065
Yes.

575
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,434
You work at the Manila hospital?

576
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,163
Why?

577
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,472
I am with the Japanese Military Police.

578
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,346
Please come with me.

579
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:33,209
Utinsky is a German name?

580
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:34,751
Lithuanian.

581
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,810
- You were born in Lithuania?
- Kovno.

582
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,683
You speak good English.

583
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:44,023
I was raised in Canada.

584
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:48,087
You have a passport
to prove you are Lithuanian?

585
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,463
My papers are back at the apartment.

586
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,765
May I have your keys?

587
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,806
- I can go get them for you.
- Your keys.

588
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,886
<i>('officer) Why did you stay in Manila
when the war started?</i>

589
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:12,445
I'm a nurse. I wanted to help people.

590
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:16,789
You think the people of this country
want American help?

591
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,987
I'm Lithuanian, not American.

592
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,224
Your passport is forged.

593
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,899
I've traveled everywhere
on that passport.

594
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,774
Do you know a woman
called Mina Corcurea?

595
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,602
No.

596
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,946
This morning,

597
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:44,477
you assaulted a man
who was following her in the street.

598
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:49,686
I was assaulted myself,
if that's what you're talking about.

599
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,297
Mina Corcurea

600
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:57,425
is a member
of the Filipino underground.

601
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:02,465
She and her father

602
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,337
are responsible for stealing medicine

603
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,344
from wounded Japanese soldiers

604
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:12,371
and smuggling it
to American prisoners of war.

605
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:22,681
I'm a citizen of a neutral country.

606
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,695
I have no dealings whatsoever
with any underground

607
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,459
or any American prisoners of war.

608
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,199
- Is this your Bible?
- I don't know.

609
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,405
Did you take it from my apartment?

610
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,847
You were married to an American officer
before the war?

611
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,249
I've never been married.

612
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,418
Then...

613
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,550
who is this man?

614
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,686
Your husband?

615
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:07,601
Your lover?

616
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,633
No.

617
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:16,941
But you keep a picture of him
in your Bible.

618
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:25,249
<i>- ('speaks Japanese)
- ('guard responds)</i>

619
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,518
<i>('guard shouts)</i>

620
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,324
<i>('guard speaks Japanese)</i>

621
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,661
<i>('speaks Japanese) From Manila, sir.</i>

00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,375
<i>('shouts in Japanese)</i>

00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,731
<i>(♫ opera on record player)</i>

624
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,136
Would you like to sit, Major?

625
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,465
You know her?

626
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,693
I knew her briefly.

627
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,870
Why?

628
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,702
She claims she knew you well.

629
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:29,076
She claims she stayed behind
in the Philippines to be near you.

630
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:33,679
I find that hard to believe.

631
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,184
I didn't make much
of an impression on her.

632
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,744
She clearly left an impression on you.

633
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,791
Would you like to see her again?

634
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,352
What's that to you?

635
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:52,235
We know this woman

636
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,033
is the head
of an underground movement in Manila...

637
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:02,275
responsible for smuggling stolen medicine
into this camp.

638
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,177
If you convince her to confess

639
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:08,241
and give us
the names of her accomplices,

640
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,744
I guarantee the two of you

641
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:15,690
will be free to leave
the Philippines together.

642
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,657
And if I don't?

643
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,701
You'll be returned
to your hospital ward to die.

644
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:32,067
I assume your colleagues
made her the same offer?

645
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,975
I wouldn't know.

646
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:39,778
She must've turned 'em down.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here now.

647
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:44,777
I'm offering you your future, Major.

648
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,491
My future isn't in your hands.

649
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:26,058
- Aw, honey, you look great.
- So do you.

650
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,324
Pity there ain't
a Cabanatuan beauty contest.

651
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,229
Shucks.

652
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,032
I got you something.

653
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,617
- I hoped it would be quinine.
- Gettin' fussy now, huh?

654
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,710
Sure am.

655
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,255
It didn't get through.

656
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:57,987
Your friend Nagai stopped
all work details to Cabanatuan City.

657
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,622
He's got us digging
air-raid shelters instead.

658
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,893
They'll find some other way
to smuggle it in.

659
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,630
It'll be too late for you by then, old pal.

660
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,831
You ain't thinking of leaving me.

661
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,309
I don't think Nagai's men
want me here.

662
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:18,507
I can think of ten of us that do.

663
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:23,178
Like I said, you're the only one
I give a damn about.

664
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:26,416
You and the kid sometimes.

665
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,252
Don't try it, Red.

666
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,627
I'll see you, Gibby.

667
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,085
Tell Duke and Pitt
to keep an eye on him.

668
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:03,688
<i>('cheering)</i>

669
01:01:13,823 --> 01:01:16,993
Is there anyone
who doesn't know we're out here?

670
01:01:18,077 --> 01:01:19,871
It's hard for them to understand, sir.

671
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:22,665
They see American soldiers,
they think the war is over.

672
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:29,339
All right, all right.

673
01:01:36,095 --> 01:01:41,309
Colonel, may I discuss with you
the role of my men in your mission?

674
01:01:42,393 --> 01:01:46,272
Your men will be
screening our flanks, Captain.

675
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:53,029
Sir, this is our war, too. We've been
fighting the Japanese for three years.

676
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:57,408
Captain Pajota, I understand your anger
at what the Japs did to your people today.

677
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:02,539
If I were you, I'd also want revenge.
But this mission has objectives of its own.

678
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:07,085
Sir, my men are disciplined fighters. What
happened at Balincarin is not new to them.

679
01:02:07,168 --> 01:02:10,505
Your men will be of great value
on our flanks.

680
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:13,675
Lieutenant O'Grady,
I'm going to step away.

681
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:16,219
My compliments to the villagers
for their hospitality.

682
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:17,595
I'll see to it, sir.

683
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:19,681
- Captain.
- Colonel.

684
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:30,024
Want me to take a look
at those feet, Captain?

685
01:02:31,568 --> 01:02:33,903
Yeah.

686
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:38,700
God only knows
how you walk on these, Bob.

687
01:02:39,909 --> 01:02:43,955
You're lucky the colonel
doesn't know about this.

688
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,460
Doc, can you figure him out?

689
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,006
- Mucci?
- Yeah.

690
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:56,467
Every time I think I have,
he surprises me.

691
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:58,887
Not always in a bad way.

692
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:03,600
He's the reason I joined the Rangers.

693
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:08,938
There was a time I'd follow him anywhere,
but all we seem to do now is butt heads.

694
01:03:11,357 --> 01:03:15,153
You know, he may not like
you standing up to him...

695
01:03:16,154 --> 01:03:19,365
but I suspect that's why he chose you.

696
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:24,412
I can't imagine any other reason why he'd
ignore these jungle-rotted dogs of yours.

697
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:28,875
Besides, think he's out there
feeling on top of the world?

698
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:41,596
<i>That's the convoy
Captain Pajota was talking about.</i>

699
01:03:47,185 --> 01:03:51,564
Damn, looks like
they're reinforcing the camp.

700
01:03:52,815 --> 01:03:55,235
Hey, Duke, wake up.

701
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:59,531
It's your turn
to keep watch on Red.

702
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:04,285
Yeah. Yeah.

703
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,986
He's gone.

704
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:23,573
He's gone, dammit.
You fell asleep.

705
01:06:35,979 --> 01:06:39,315
Because one man disobeyed me...

706
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:43,194
ten others will pay the price.

707
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,017
No. Look, my fault.

708
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,602
<i>Please.</i>

709
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:17,520
Please. My fault.

710
01:10:10,193 --> 01:10:12,570
<i>They resupplied the camp
last night.</i>

711
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:15,073
Brought in fuel and fresh troops.

712
01:10:15,156 --> 01:10:18,034
Looks like they're up to something.

713
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:20,912
How many?

714
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:23,706
Between 150 and 200 of 'em, sir.

715
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,417
Captain?

716
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:29,671
I was depending on the second platoon
of Fox to hold the Cabu bridge,

717
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:33,174
but if the Japs have 300 men in the camp,
we'll need everyone on the raid.

718
01:10:33,258 --> 01:10:36,010
Maybe we can
hold the bridge with less men.

719
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:39,722
Can you make do
with just one squad from Riley's platoon?

720
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:45,812
I don't think so, sir. Captain Pajota said
the Japs reinforced the bridge last night.

721
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:51,109
Well, I wish Captain Pajota had shared
this information with me earlier.

722
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:52,902
Let's take a look.

723
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:23,099
Get a count.

724
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:31,024
With respect, sir, what's to count?

725
01:11:32,483 --> 01:11:36,446
Lieutenant Riley's right, sir.
That's a thousand men over there.

726
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:41,075
Captain, may I show you something?
Here's the bridge.

727
01:11:50,877 --> 01:11:52,795
Colonel.

728
01:11:56,216 --> 01:12:00,261
The others are beginning
to lose faith, aren't they?

729
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:04,641
<i>- They won't let you down.
- It's not a question of letting me down.</i>

730
01:12:04,724 --> 01:12:08,478
We worked hard to raise a fine unit.
They deserve their shot at glory.

731
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:15,068
I don't suppose many of us
are in this for the glory, sir.

732
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:18,112
I'm not talking about publicity, Bob.

733
01:12:18,154 --> 01:12:20,823
It's the glory you carry inside you
the rest of your life

734
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:25,453
knowing you've done something,
something that made a difference.

735
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:29,290
The only recognition I want
is from those boys in that camp.

736
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:30,667
Yes, sir.

737
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,837
Did you come here
to change my mind?

738
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:36,923
No, sir.

739
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:42,011
I came to tell you that whatever you
decide, it'll be the right choice.

740
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:45,515
Some things you gotta take on faith.

741
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:53,147
Captain Pajota has
volunteered to hold the bridge,

742
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,567
if you're willing
to hear him out.

743
01:13:01,322 --> 01:13:05,577
Well, you better give me a moment alone
with him so I can eat some humble pie.

744
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,662
Yes, sir.

745
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:14,043
Captain Pajota?

746
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:18,381
We wait until they are at this point,
then we blow up the bridge.

747
01:13:18,423 --> 01:13:21,009
We don't have enough explosives
to bring it down.

748
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:24,721
All we need to do is damage it
enough to stop their vehicles.

749
01:13:24,804 --> 01:13:27,015
We want the soldiers to come.

750
01:13:27,056 --> 01:13:31,227
If I place my men on either side of the
road, we'll trap them in a crossfire.

751
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:34,397
They'll go around the bridge
and try to outflank you.

752
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,859
The Japanese don't go around,
not when they're fighting Filipinos.

753
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:41,946
They don't have enough respect
for us as soldiers.

754
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:58,213
- How are the others?
- Scared.

755
01:13:59,923 --> 01:14:03,384
They're waiting to hear
what you have to say, sir.

756
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:07,931
I don't know
what to tell them anymore.

757
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,437
I can say something
on your behalf, sir.

758
01:14:14,521 --> 01:14:16,856
Until you feel better.

759
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:25,657
Are you any good at writing letters?

760
01:14:26,783 --> 01:14:29,869
It depends what kind of letter.

761
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:34,624
I'm not sure myself.

762
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:38,378
I already started a dozen times
and tore it up.

763
01:14:41,756 --> 01:14:46,844
There's a... pencil and paper
under my mat.

764
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:00,567
Who you writing to?

765
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,486
A lady named Margaret.

766
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:08,700
I'm not sure how well
I know her anymore.

767
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:12,287
I've been living
in my imagination so long,

768
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:17,083
I'm afraid I'll write
some crazy love letter...

769
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:20,962
and embarrass us both.

770
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:24,007
Red didn't seem to think so.

771
01:15:29,137 --> 01:15:31,848
What'd he tell you?

772
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,018
That she felt the same way you did.

773
01:15:36,186 --> 01:15:40,815
That she'd have left her husband
if you'd wanted her to.

774
01:15:42,525 --> 01:15:48,281
Guess I thought that if I did the
right thing, some good would come of it.

775
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,243
It's funny.

776
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:55,622
I've spent the last three years

777
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:59,250
thinking of all the things
I wanna say to her.

778
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:06,591
Now I don't even know how to begin.

779
01:16:08,301 --> 01:16:11,221
How about, "Dear Margaret"?

780
01:16:38,665 --> 01:16:42,544
We found the people
we were looking for.

781
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:52,971
<i>You are free to go.</i>

782
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:51,154
<i>Follow her!
She'll lead us to the others.</i>

783
01:18:15,887 --> 01:18:17,722
Shh.

784
01:18:18,723 --> 01:18:21,809
It's all right.
You're safe now.

785
01:18:24,687 --> 01:18:27,732
- They killed Mina.
- I know.

786
01:18:30,276 --> 01:18:32,612
I wasn't always conscious.

787
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:38,368
- I don't know what I told them.
- You didn't tell them anything.

788
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:42,872
Mina and her father were arrested
last night on their way to Cabanatuan.

789
01:18:42,914 --> 01:18:45,500
It had nothing to do with you.

790
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,919
She went because of me.

791
01:18:49,379 --> 01:18:53,508
- She knew I wanted to help Daniel.
- She wanted to help him, too.

792
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,219
I should've stopped her.

793
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:59,639
I should've stopped her.

794
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:03,017
But all I could think about was him.

795
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:07,730
Whatever you feel you've done wrong,
you've more than made up for it.

796
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:10,984
Hundreds of POWs
owe you their lives.

797
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:14,404
No. I did it for him.

798
01:19:14,445 --> 01:19:18,241
- I stayed for him.
- You'll be with him soon.

799
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:22,912
I have friends who will hide you
till the Americans come.

800
01:19:22,996 --> 01:19:25,623
But, Margaret, listen to me.

801
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:30,920
You have to trust in something
stronger than yourself.

802
01:19:30,962 --> 01:19:34,382
Father! Father, the Japanese -
they're here.

803
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:37,969
Take Margaret.
I'll deal with them.

804
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,391
<i>Arrest anyone you find!
Go around back.</i>

805
01:19:51,566 --> 01:19:53,067
Agh!

806
01:20:00,867 --> 01:20:03,745
OK, run. Run.
Don't look back.

807
01:20:06,122 --> 01:20:09,083
No need to go in the church.
There's no one in there.

808
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:12,170
<i>There's no one in the church.</i>

809
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:32,899
Gents, here it is. At 1700 hours,
our combined forces will leave Platero.

810
01:20:32,982 --> 01:20:35,235
We'll split up here
at the Pampanga River.

811
01:20:35,318 --> 01:20:39,656
Captain Pajota, you'll continue to the Cabu
bridge, where you'll set up a roadblock.

812
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:42,825
Captain Joson,
do the same on the highway

813
01:20:42,909 --> 01:20:45,745
in case the Japs send reinforcements
from Cabanatuan City.

814
01:20:45,828 --> 01:20:49,791
Your objective is to seal off
the area of operation during the raid.

815
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:53,670
Any Japanese reinforcements
get through you, they get to us.

816
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:57,298
We'll need as much darkness as we can
to get the POWs out of the camp,

817
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,469
so we'll have to begin our approach
during daylight and risk detection.

818
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:05,849
We break the tree line, Lieutenant Riley's
platoon will head to the east of the camp.

819
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:06,850
Sir.

820
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:10,228
The rest of us will advance
at a low crawl for the main gate.

821
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:11,771
How much cover, Captain?

822
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:14,190
There's cover
up to 200 yards from the camp.

823
01:21:14,232 --> 01:21:19,320
After that, we're totally exposed until we
reach a ditch 30 yards from the front gate.

824
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:21,531
This is the camp.

825
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:27,912
This is the main service road,
POW barracks - all enemy occupied.

826
01:21:27,996 --> 01:21:32,876
Suspected tank shed, main gate.
This is the ditch we're trying to reach.

827
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:35,503
Until we get there
we're completely exposed,

828
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:39,299
so we may need to create some
diversionary action in this wooded area.

829
01:21:39,382 --> 01:21:44,137
Sir, how about a plane? Could you have
one of your planes fly over the camp?

830
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,389
Not without breaking radio silence.

831
01:21:46,472 --> 01:21:49,392
It's not a bad idea, Bob.
Might be worth the risk.

832
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:52,520
Good. As we make our approach,

833
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:55,940
Lieutenant Riley's men
will make their way along this ditch,

834
01:21:56,024 --> 01:22:00,695
leaving men at 20-yard intervals
to engage and reduce the enemy.

835
01:22:00,737 --> 01:22:04,949
Lieutenant Riley, soon as you're
in position here, the southeast corner,

836
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:08,912
- your first shot will kick off the action.
- Understood.

837
01:22:08,995 --> 01:22:12,749
Good. Meanwhile, the rest of us
will be in position here.

838
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:15,877
Soon as we get the signal,
Lieutenant Foley's second squad

839
01:22:15,919 --> 01:22:18,546
will take out the guard tower
and sentry shack,

840
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:21,799
and cover first squad,
who will open the main gate.

841
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:24,719
Soon as first squad is inside,
they'll flank right,

842
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:27,514
lay down suppressing fire
on the enemy officer area,

843
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:29,807
and cover the guys heading
toward the tank shed.

844
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:33,394
I want Corporal Aldrige
and his loader to run the 200 yards.

845
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:37,398
I want a backup team in case they don't
make it. Tanks get loose, we're in trouble.

846
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:40,693
- Yes, sir.
- Extraction's next.

847
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:44,739
Lieutenant O'Grady, second platoon will
make their way through the main gate

848
01:22:44,781 --> 01:22:47,450
and force entry into the POW area.

849
01:22:47,534 --> 01:22:50,036
First squad will spread
along the south fence

850
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:53,164
and lay down suppressing fire
to the enemy rear.

851
01:22:53,248 --> 01:22:58,503
Make sure the POW barracks are protected
from enemy fire in all directions.

852
01:22:58,586 --> 01:23:01,714
Once that's achieved,
Lieutenant O'Grady's second squad

853
01:23:01,798 --> 01:23:05,176
will round up the POWs
and lead them to the front gate,

854
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,679
where Dr. Fisher and the medics
will be waiting.

855
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,889
Our aim is to make it
to the Pampanga River,

856
01:23:09,973 --> 01:23:12,934
where carabao carts
will be waiting to escort the prisoners.

857
01:23:12,976 --> 01:23:15,478
As soon as I'm satisfied
we've left no one behind,

858
01:23:15,562 --> 01:23:19,649
I'll fire a red star cluster
to signal the raid's over.

859
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:22,026
Any questions?

860
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,904
Yes, sir.
Who's the last man out?

861
01:23:24,988 --> 01:23:27,824
That'll be me.
You'll cover me at the front gate.

862
01:23:27,907 --> 01:23:30,702
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

863
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,913
Brief your people,
get 'em ready to go.

864
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:36,332
We leave in two hours.

865
01:24:02,358 --> 01:24:04,360
You OK, Top?

866
01:24:05,028 --> 01:24:07,155
Yeah, I'm all right.

867
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,369
I want a word about Lieutenant Riley.

868
01:24:17,832 --> 01:24:19,834
He's got a tough assignment.

869
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:26,216
What's that?

870
01:24:26,633 --> 01:24:28,718
Why?

871
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:31,137
Nothing. Just curious.

872
01:24:35,225 --> 01:24:37,185
250 Japs at that camp.

873
01:24:37,268 --> 01:24:40,313
Another thousand at the river.

874
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:42,690
10,000 more nearby.

875
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:45,735
Only 120 of us.

876
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:49,072
I figure we're gonna need
a little miracle.

877
01:24:55,078 --> 01:24:57,622
Go ahead, take it.
I got plenty to spare.

878
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:06,089
What do I gotta do, kiss it?

879
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:12,679
<i>The time is now 1715.</i>

880
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:15,056
And...

881
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:17,642
mark.

882
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,894
Plane'll buzz the camp at 1800.

883
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:22,856
Lieutenant Riley
fires his first shot at 1930.

884
01:25:22,939 --> 01:25:25,525
Captain Pajota
blows the bridge at 1945.

885
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:30,947
God willing, we'll be out of there by 2100.
Any questions?

886
01:25:30,989 --> 01:25:34,617
Let's all try to get back in one piece.

887
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,245
Good luck, gentlemen.

888
01:26:10,653 --> 01:26:14,240
- Top, go with Lieutenant Riley.
- Yes, sir.

889
01:26:14,324 --> 01:26:15,700
Good luck.

890
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:41,851
- What have you got, Daly?
- We're breaking cover, sir.

891
01:26:44,187 --> 01:26:47,732
Captain, Prince saw
you could use an extra man.

892
01:26:47,815 --> 01:26:50,568
Stick with me
till we get the fence line.

893
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:17,405
Where the hell
are those goddamn flyboys?

894
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:49,581
It's one of ours, sir.

895
01:30:04,721 --> 01:30:08,349
<i>Get them back to their
positions. Tighten security.</i>

896
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:11,853
<i>Guards, back to your positions!</i>

897
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:23,776
CABANATUAN ROAD

898
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:06,694
I'll be back in the morning, sir.

899
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:11,783
Just in case... I'm not here.

900
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:18,206
You'll give it to her yourself, sir.

901
01:33:26,589 --> 01:33:28,758
<i>Sir...</i>

902
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,429
it's time.

903
01:33:34,597 --> 01:33:37,308
First Sergeant,

904
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:40,186
if I'm going to be the
one to start this thing,

905
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:42,564
I wanna be sure
everyone's in position.

906
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:47,902
I'll check it out.

907
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:02,834
Come on, Lieutenant Riley.

908
01:34:09,173 --> 01:34:11,885
What the hell is Riley doing, sir?

909
01:34:25,648 --> 01:34:27,984
Lieutenant wants to make sure
you're in position.

910
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:31,070
We have been for the last ten minutes.

911
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:34,157
I'll tell him.

912
01:34:36,117 --> 01:34:41,122
The guerillas are edgy. They're afraid the
bridge will blow before the raid begins.

913
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,835
Dammit.

914
01:34:55,553 --> 01:34:57,764
We're in position, sir.

915
01:35:02,101 --> 01:35:04,145
Sir...

916
01:35:04,187 --> 01:35:07,023
it's your shot.

917
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,260
Fire!

918
01:35:32,882 --> 01:35:35,218
The Japs are shooting us.
They'll kill us all.

919
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:23,057
Go! Go!

920
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:34,277
Aldrige, Lucas, go, go!

921
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,164
Shoot the damn lock!

922
01:37:15,026 --> 01:37:17,195
Fire.

923
01:37:18,488 --> 01:37:19,822
Up!

924
01:37:45,682 --> 01:37:48,726
- Let's go, Two!
- You heard him! Move, move!

925
01:37:50,687 --> 01:37:52,355
Run, run!

926
01:38:02,866 --> 01:38:05,243
Go! Let's move, move!

927
01:38:06,202 --> 01:38:07,704
Go!

928
01:38:07,745 --> 01:38:10,039
We're good. We're go.

929
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:13,459
Take your squad to the left.
Push 'em out of here!

930
01:38:13,543 --> 01:38:16,170
Lay some fire!

931
01:38:16,254 --> 01:38:19,215
Go, go, go!

932
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,725
Go, go!

933
01:38:37,108 --> 01:38:38,943
Cover fire!

934
01:39:18,274 --> 01:39:20,109
Jammed! Riley!

935
01:39:30,537 --> 01:39:32,539
Come on!

936
01:39:32,622 --> 01:39:37,377
It's all right! We're Americans!
We're gonna get you out of here.

937
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,671
Those who can walk,
head for the main gate.

938
01:39:39,754 --> 01:39:42,757
Those who can't, wait.
We'll come back for you.

939
01:39:43,299 --> 01:39:44,592
Tank!

940
01:39:45,176 --> 01:39:47,303
Come on!

941
01:39:48,805 --> 01:39:50,932
<i>Come on, Lucas!</i>

942
01:39:57,897 --> 01:40:00,400
- Shift fire left!
- Shift fire left!

943
01:40:00,483 --> 01:40:03,111
- Cover me!
- Covering!

944
01:40:16,624 --> 01:40:18,918
Covering fire!

945
01:40:19,002 --> 01:40:20,545
Covering!

946
01:40:24,382 --> 01:40:26,634
Son of a bitch!

947
01:41:29,239 --> 01:41:31,866
<i>Riley, get your men in!</i>

948
01:41:35,078 --> 01:41:37,038
Hey!

949
01:41:54,013 --> 01:41:56,599
It's OK. I'm an American.

950
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,602
We're here to take you home.

951
01:42:00,854 --> 01:42:05,567
Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you.
We're here to help you.

952
01:42:05,608 --> 01:42:09,571
You're going home. Understand?

953
01:42:09,612 --> 01:42:12,115
You're going home.

954
01:42:12,156 --> 01:42:14,284
I-I can't leave him.

955
01:42:15,326 --> 01:42:18,997
We won't leave him.
I'll take him myself, all right?

956
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,376
I need you to go out there and tell my men
there's people here need to be carried.

957
01:42:23,459 --> 01:42:26,838
Can you do that?
All right, let's go. Let's go.

958
01:42:31,718 --> 01:42:33,970
I got you.

959
01:42:34,012 --> 01:42:36,556
No, no.

960
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,350
Here you go.

961
01:42:48,318 --> 01:42:51,446
<i>Wait. Soldier,
there's sick men back there.</i>

962
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:37,033
Pajota's holding so far, but they're trying
to flank him 100 yards down the river.

963
01:43:37,116 --> 01:43:41,704
Better take a look. Japanese get across
that river, we'll never get these men out.

964
01:43:41,788 --> 01:43:43,665
<i>Keep moving. Let's go.</i>

965
01:43:43,706 --> 01:43:46,125
- Get in there and help 'em out.
- Sir.

966
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:48,169
Everyone who can move,
get on your feet.

967
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:09,816
Hold your fire.
Miller, gimme the flare gun.

968
01:44:12,986 --> 01:44:16,322
Wait till I light 'em up.

969
01:44:42,098 --> 01:44:44,934
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Let's fall back!

970
01:44:44,976 --> 01:44:47,562
Get 'em the hell outta here!
Let's go! Move!

971
01:45:01,284 --> 01:45:04,287
<i>Does the mortar work?</i>

972
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:07,373
- It's damaged, sir, but still working.
- Target the main gate.

973
01:45:11,002 --> 01:45:14,797
<i>Let's go, let's go!
Move!</i>

974
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:18,426
Head to the gate.
Head to the gate.

975
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:24,807
Dr. Fisher, sir, stay back.
It's not safe yet.

976
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:27,810
All right, I'll be on
the other side of the road.

977
01:45:27,852 --> 01:45:30,480
Here, let me give you a hand.

978
01:45:31,314 --> 01:45:33,149
Pull back!

979
01:45:33,233 --> 01:45:36,277
Pull back!
Daly, pull back!

980
01:45:36,736 --> 01:45:40,740
Fox Two, back to the rally point!
Let's go! Move!

981
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:51,292
Keep going!

982
01:45:55,463 --> 01:45:59,509
Mortar! Get down! Down!

983
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,473
Lay some fire
on that son of a bitch!

984
01:46:05,515 --> 01:46:08,768
- Aliteri, Gutierrez, take this man.
- Yes, sir.

985
01:46:09,894 --> 01:46:11,479
<i>Let's go.</i>

986
01:46:11,563 --> 01:46:14,440
Don't stop! Push 'em
through that front gate!

987
01:46:14,524 --> 01:46:16,901
Front gate! Dock point!

988
01:46:16,985 --> 01:46:20,071
- Keep 'em moving!
- Keep going, guys.

989
01:46:20,154 --> 01:46:22,824
Daly, come on.

990
01:46:24,284 --> 01:46:27,328
- Charge the gate. I'll cover you. Ready?
- Ready.

991
01:46:29,998 --> 01:46:32,500
Mortar! Everybody down!

992
01:46:32,542 --> 01:46:34,460
Down!

993
01:46:36,713 --> 01:46:39,340
Get up! Move!

994
01:46:39,424 --> 01:46:41,009
Keep moving!

995
01:46:41,092 --> 01:46:44,554
Go! Get 'em on their feet!
Keep 'em moving!

996
01:46:44,637 --> 01:46:47,348
Get 'em out the gate!
Let's go!

997
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:07,076
- Keep 'em moving!
- Come on, men. Get 'em out!

998
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:08,369
Get 'em through the gate!

999
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:15,251
Mortar!

1000
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:19,938
Go!

1001
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:28,056
Daly, hold him down!
I'm gonna flank him!

1002
01:47:41,653 --> 01:47:43,196
Son of a bitch.

1003
01:48:28,783 --> 01:48:30,159
Argh!

1004
01:48:41,754 --> 01:48:44,299
Aargh!

1005
01:49:31,054 --> 01:49:33,181
Sarge!

1006
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:37,685
- You all right?
- Daly, where the hell you been?

1007
01:49:37,727 --> 01:49:40,063
Clear!

1008
01:49:49,113 --> 01:49:52,075
<i>Everybody goes out.
Take everybody with us.</i>

1009
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:54,369
Someone get a medic over here!

1010
01:49:55,286 --> 01:49:58,206
Soldier, you all right?

1011
01:49:59,082 --> 01:50:00,708
Jesus.

1012
01:50:00,792 --> 01:50:02,877
Jimmy.

1013
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:09,759
<i>It's a mortar wound, sir.
He's lost a lot of blood.</i>

1014
01:50:09,843 --> 01:50:13,388
- I don't know if we can move him, Captain.
- We got no choice.

1015
01:50:13,471 --> 01:50:15,056
Jimmy?

1016
01:50:15,098 --> 01:50:16,516
- Move me.
- All right.

1017
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:19,143
Get him to Platero.
Stay with him, understand?

1018
01:50:19,227 --> 01:50:21,688
- Yes, sir.
- Hang in there, Doc.

1019
01:50:26,276 --> 01:50:28,111
Clear!

1020
01:50:32,907 --> 01:50:35,076
Clear. Last man.

1021
01:50:44,502 --> 01:50:47,714
Sniper! Enemy fire on your left!

1022
01:50:54,012 --> 01:50:57,307
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Hold your fire!

1023
01:50:57,348 --> 01:51:00,518
<i>- Fall back. Let's go!
- Fall back! Fall back!</i>

1024
01:51:00,602 --> 01:51:03,229
Daly. Daly! Daly!

1025
01:51:03,313 --> 01:51:06,149
Mack, Stratton, on me now!

1026
01:51:10,987 --> 01:51:14,949
<i>Come on, Daly. Come on.</i>

1027
01:51:16,951 --> 01:51:19,120
We've lost him.

1028
01:51:19,162 --> 01:51:21,122
<i>Let's move!</i>

1029
01:52:14,384 --> 01:52:17,512
<i>Come on, Fox Two,
keep it moving.</i>

1030
01:52:17,554 --> 01:52:19,013
Let's get 'em across.

1031
01:52:19,055 --> 01:52:21,057
You all right?

1032
01:52:21,099 --> 01:52:22,559
You OK?

1033
01:52:22,642 --> 01:52:24,060
Keep movin'.

1034
01:52:47,792 --> 01:52:50,587
<i>It's gonna be all right, Major.</i>

1035
01:52:50,628 --> 01:52:52,755
We're going home.

1036
01:52:58,219 --> 01:53:00,221
<i>Captain Prince.</i>

1037
01:53:01,264 --> 01:53:03,266
How did we do?

1038
01:53:03,349 --> 01:53:05,268
Got 'em all, sir.

1039
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:06,769
How many casualties?

1040
01:53:06,853 --> 01:53:10,356
One KIA - Pfc Daly.

1041
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,984
And Doc Jimmy's wounded, too.

1042
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:17,280
I think it's critical.
We moved him to Platero to operate.

1043
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:20,366
I don't think he's gonna make it, sir.

1044
01:53:21,868 --> 01:53:23,578
Thanks, Captain.

1045
01:53:28,166 --> 01:53:30,919
<i>Possible liver involvement,</i>

1046
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,129
certainly colon.

1047
01:53:34,172 --> 01:53:37,675
<i>- You need any morphine?
- No.</i>

1048
01:53:37,759 --> 01:53:39,511
That's for you to keep.

1049
01:53:39,594 --> 01:53:41,763
More plasma.

1050
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,356
Did we get 'em out?

1051
01:53:52,607 --> 01:53:54,984
Did we get them out?

1052
01:53:57,737 --> 01:54:00,490
All of them.

1053
01:54:01,282 --> 01:54:03,117
Good.

1054
01:54:05,328 --> 01:54:07,455
Better keep moving, Henry.

1055
01:54:11,209 --> 01:54:13,711
We're heading out now.

1056
01:55:00,091 --> 01:55:03,678
- Have you seen Major Gibson?
- Sorry, ma'am.

1057
01:55:05,263 --> 01:55:07,265
Six bucks.

1058
01:55:08,057 --> 01:55:10,310
Told ya, I can't sell it.

1059
01:55:10,393 --> 01:55:12,729
Ten bucks?

1060
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:15,356
I can't do it.
It's the only one I got.

1061
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,403
What do you mean, it's the only one
you got? You said you had plenty to spare.

1062
01:55:20,486 --> 01:55:22,906
I lied to you.

1063
01:55:22,989 --> 01:55:25,491
My mom gave this to me.

1064
01:55:29,037 --> 01:55:31,539
Well, how's your mom feel
about ten bucks?

1065
01:55:34,584 --> 01:55:37,879
- How's your mom feel about ten bucks?
- Hey.

1066
01:55:39,255 --> 01:55:41,716
I'm sorry.
Have you seen Major Gibson?

1067
01:55:41,799 --> 01:55:46,721
Yeah, he was with us at the river. Check
with the medics, ma'am, down by the carts.

1068
01:55:46,763 --> 01:55:48,765
Thank you.

1069
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:13,289
Margaret.

1070
01:56:13,373 --> 01:56:15,542
Where is he?

1071
01:57:21,274 --> 01:57:23,860
He wanted me to give you this.

1072
01:57:51,137 --> 01:57:53,181
<i>"Dear Margaret.</i>

1073
01:57:53,223 --> 01:57:58,186

so much destruction and suffering.</i>

1074
01:57:58,228 --> 01:58:01,814

1075
01:58:01,898 --> 01:58:07,028

1077
01:58:09,572 --> 01:58:12,242

01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:16,829

1079
01:58:16,913 --> 01:58:19,332

the world to me.</i>

1080
01:58:19,415 --> 01:58:23,253
<i>"And not just to me.

1081
01:58:23,837 --> 01:58:27,799

General, this is the man
who led the raid, Captain Prince.

1088
01:59:16,973 --> 01:59:18,808
Congratulations, Captain Prince.

1089
01:59:18,892 --> 01:59:21,102
I'm very sorry about your losses.

1090
01:59:21,144 --> 01:59:24,272
I want you to know you have done
a great service for your country.

1091
01:59:24,355 --> 01:59:27,734
- Thank you, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1092
01:59:27,817 --> 01:59:30,445
- After you, Major.
- Nice job.

1093
01:59:34,741 --> 01:59:36,993
So...

1094
01:59:37,076 --> 01:59:39,078
how do you feel?

1095
01:59:39,162 --> 01:59:41,122
All right.

1096
01:59:42,665 --> 01:59:45,126
I'm proud of you.

1097
01:59:46,377 --> 01:59:48,379
Thank you, sir.

1098
01:59:58,681 --> 02:00:01,351
<i>Never in our history
had such a large group of men</i>

1099
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:04,979
<i>endured so much
and complained so little.</i>

1100
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:09,943
<i>Many were unable to shake the belief
that their country had abandoned them.</i>

1101
02:00:10,026 --> 02:00:13,071
<i>Left them to die in a foreign land.</i>

1102
02:00:13,154 --> 02:00:16,241
<i>It was said to be
of no significance to the war effort.</i>

1103
02:00:16,324 --> 02:00:21,079
<i>Although for me. Saving them
was a way of setting things right.</i>

1104
02:00:21,162 --> 02:00:22,789
<i>It's true -</i>

1105
02:00:22,872 --> 02:00:25,333
<i>they had been left behind.</i>

1106
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:28,336
<i>But never forgotten.</i>
