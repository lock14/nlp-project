1
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,808
Mike!

2
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:45,211
Did you sweep the pool?

3
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,014
Why?
- Because people wanna swim.

4
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,832
How are you feeling today, ma?
- Feeling great, Mike. - Good.

5
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,022
Where's dad?
- Crossword.

6
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,929
Checking out of 202.
- How was your stay, Mr Edmunds?

7
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,351
Fine, thanks.
- Thank you so much.

8
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:11,868
So two nights, preferably upstairs.
- Oh sure.

9
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,027
Let's see, smoking or non-smoking?
- Non-smoking.

10
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,459
I got you into 203.
- Okay.

11
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,764
Nice room. Oh this is our snack-bar,
the prices are on the wall.

12
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,259
Sorry.

13
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,342
There you go.
Thank you.

14
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,390
Anything else you should need,
just give me a call. - Thank you very much.

15
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,200
Do you need help with your bags?
- No, I'm fine.

16
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:55,192
110's called twice to complain
that 111's making too much noise.

17
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:59,966
Yeah, what kind of noise? - Not that kind of
noise Mike, now get your mind out of the gutter.

18
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,953
Apparently 111's got some
sort of grinder in there.

19
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:07,978
I thought you said to get my mind out
of the gutter? - Don't be gross, Mike.

20
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,856
Get some sleep, you look tired.
- I'm not tired.

21
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,437
You look tired.
- You're the one who's sick, ma.

22
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:16,947
Now that's a nice thing to say.

23
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:19,761
Sorry. I love you.

24
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,300
Love you too.
- Good night, dad. - All right.

25
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,205
Who is it?
- Management.

26
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:30,479
What?
- Management. Welcome gift.

27
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,180
Hi.
- Hi.

28
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,573
I have your complimentary bottle... 
welcome gift.

29
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,651
Wine. It's on the house.

30
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,097
I'm uh, oh, Mike. And I am with management.

31
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:56,339
Nice to meet you, Mike.
- Oh it's... uh... my pleasure.

32
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:02,073
So, where would you like it?
- You know what I can just, I can just take it.

33
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:04,475
Oh, okay.

34
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,772
Do you uh, I'm sorry.
Would you like me to open it? For you?

35
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,892
I mean. Yeah, cause sometimes
guests don't have screws. Or, screws.

36
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,931
Yeah, okay, sure.

37
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:22,473
Just close this here.

38
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,946
Thanks.

39
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,718
Anything interesting tonight?

40
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,441
I haven't really been paying attention.

41
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,503
I know the feeling.

42
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,450
You know,
there should be cups in the bathroom.

43
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,826
Completely sanitary.
- That's good.

44
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,575
Wine is delicious.

45
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,177
Shall I?

46
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,579
Okay, sure.

47
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,856
Pretty good year.

48
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:52,097
Sometimes guests like me
to join in and have a taste.

49
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:55,483
Is that right?
- Not always but... often.

50
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,158
Should be another cup in the bathroom.
- I should get to work Mike, so...

51
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,056
What do you do?
- I sell paintings.

52
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:06,461
Really? I love paintings. What kind?

53
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,466
That kind.

54
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:14,797
Oooooh. Nice.
So that's what you're doing in town.

55
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:17,489
I give presentations tomorrow and
then I fly out the next morning.

56
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,592
What say... the company that you work for?
- It's called Corporate Bliss.

57
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:25,565
And where you guys HQ?
- Maryland.

58
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:29,595
Nice.
Wait! 'Maryland, is for lovers'.

59
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,990
It's Virginia, actually 'Virginia is for lovers'.

60
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,081
'Maryland is for crabs'.
- Yeah, you're right.

61
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,401
Okay Mike... - Okay, I gotta get back to work.
Oh, solitary, great game.

62
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:45,835
Okay, I'm gonna be down in the lobby till 11,
then in my apartment after that.

63
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:51,006
But I can always be reached by a
front door buzzer. From then on. Just
take it easy on your solitary problem.

64
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,729
Yeah, have a great night.
- Good night!

65
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:23,356
...laundry room and then I came down
here into the lobby, and that's when
I realized that your establishment
doesn't have any options for recycling.

66
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:26,873
You're absolutely right, we don't.
Which I apologize for.

67
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:34,245
It's something we're working on. But as you
may know the Kingman area has been a little
slow to fully embrace the recycling issue.

68
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:37,881
- It's been voted on to...
What should I do with this bottle?

69
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:45,002
Well... - I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is something that I'm just,
I'm very passionate about.

70
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,153
Recycling?
- Yes, recycling.

71
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,826
Let me take it. I'll do it.

72
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:53,113
I was gonna make a recycling round anyway.

73
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,002
Well, that's nice of you.

74
00:09:57,003 --> 00:10:01,095
This is my son Michael,
he is the official night manager.

75
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,870
Thank you.
It's very nice of you.

76
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:12,099
You bet. I'll just be out the back
here with all my other ones.

77
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,986
I got a pretty good, big pile...

78
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:40,416
Who is it?
- Mike.

79
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,977
Oh god.

80
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,886
Champagne.
- Why?

81
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:52,532
We give it to all our guests
who stay for two nights.

82
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,172
Wow, that's a pretty good deal.

83
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:58,023
Did you and your mom come
up with that on your own?

84
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,692
So shall I?

85
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,373
Why not?

86
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:15,333
Réserve. You know,
they're always at the same place. The cups.

87
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,445
Thank you.

88
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:09,618
Do you make a toast, Mike?
- Hm, yeah, sure.

89
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,270
You're Sue, right?
- Yeah.

90
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:17,427
Here's to... people being happy!

91
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,322
How were your presentations today?

92
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,564
Average.

93
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,302
You have a great butt.

94
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:48,012
I noticed the moment you checked in and...

95
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,889
Thank you.

96
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,524
Hope that isn't too, you know...
- No. I mean yeah, but...

97
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,869
Thank you.

98
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:02,718
Do you do this a lot, Mike?
- No.

99
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,313
Sometimes?
- Fairly rarely.

100
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:07,533
Does it ever work?
- Never.

101
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:11,865
What would constitute having it work?

102
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,725
Us having sex?

103
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,801
You getting to touch my butt?

104
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:31,597
That would...
Yeah, I'd consider that... fairly... 
constitution...

105
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:39,198
Okay.

106
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,170
You can touch my butt but then you gotta go.

107
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:02,322
Okay.
- Are you serious?

108
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:05,604
Yeah, touch it and go, Mike! Just touch and go.

109
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,899
You're sure from Maryland?
- Yeah.

110
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,879
Where about?
- Columbia. What about you?

111
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,204
Here. Kingman.

112
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,277
It's very warm.

113
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:48,397
Okay, Mike. I got an early plane to
catch and well... - Yeah, me too.

114
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,764
Bye bye now.
- Bye.

115
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:27,308
Mom? Hi, it's me. I'm just checking in.
I'm in Kingman, Arizona.

116
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:34,350
Okay, that's it.
I love you and I miss you. Okay.

117
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:05,884
Hi Sue.
- Hi.

118
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:14,729
I was wondering if I could snag your cellphone
number or your email before you left?

119
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,439
I don't think so, Mike.
- Why not?

120
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,970
Ah... not my style.

121
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:27,256
But... we... you know, I uh, touched your butt.

122
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,165
I know. And it was nice.

123
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,549
I just think that's all she wrote.

124
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:57,279
That was...

125
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,616
Mike, are those high boots? - Yeah.
- You're not gonna get these off.

126
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,384
You're all checked out?
- Yeah, I get it with your wife. Earlier.

127
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:14,923
Hey, dad.
Oh! Come back and see us some time.

128
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:17,135
Mhm, yah,
now you know it all depends on work.

129
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:44,397
What was that all about?
- She sells motel paintings.

130
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:56,753
Mike, the heat's out in 118.

131
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:30,637
Thank you for calling Last Minute
Flights. - I'd like to book a... -Your
call is important to us... - Fuck!

132
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:40,107
Please continue to hold. Your call will
be answered in an orderly fashion...

133
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,408
Okay Mike, now or never.

134
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:46,898
I'm gonna do it! - Hello, Last Minute Flights,
how may I assist you?

135
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:56,358
Hi! Yeah! I'd like to book a one-way
cash ticket for as fast as possible
from Phoenix to Baltimore. Got it?

136
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:46,504
Hi, I'm here to see Sue Claussen.
- Is she expecting you?

137
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,568
Um yeah, I've left a couple of messages.
- Messages regarding...?

138
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:54,215
Regarding Sue, telling her I was in town.
I'm an old friend.

139
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:57,705
I see.

140
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,381
Sue, hi!

141
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:13,589
What are you doing here?
- I was wondering if we could talk.

142
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,677
Why are you here?
- I called twice, did you get the messages?

143
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:22,072
You know what guys, I'm sorry,
why don't you go ahead.

144
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,484
Are you sure, Sue?
- Yes, good, go.

145
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,485
Good.

146
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:33,132
Can I talk to you for a second?

147
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:37,749
This is completely inappropriate.

148
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:40,461
This is like a violation.

149
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,385
I wasn't trying to violate...
- Yes you did.

150
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:47,427
You are. You're violating my personal space,
you're violating my personal life.

151
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:50,086
I can't do this, I have to be somewhere, 
I'm late.

152
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,712
It's five o'clock what can you be late for?

153
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:53,713
I have an event.

154
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:56,847
You have an event? What kind of an event?

155
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,022
I can't tell you.

156
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,163
Can I come?

157
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,485
Here. Come on you need it.

158
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:44,816
You do this every week?
- Yeah.

159
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:47,421
You're really good at it.

160
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,286
You can't stay, Mike.
- Why not?

161
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,252
Cause it's insane.

162
00:23:56,253 --> 00:24:00,427
I let you touch my butt and then
you fly halfway across the country.

163
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:03,088
Well it was much more than a butt touch.

164
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,451
Still you can't stay.
I've got a lot of work to do.

165
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:13,677
Well how much stuff can you do in one night?
- A lot.

166
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:18,326
Like what?
You got out with friends or...?

167
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,578
You see that girl over there?

168
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,189
She works for Burger King.
She gives me vouchers every week.

169
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,963
And I pass them out.

170
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:30,364
That's what I do.

171
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:45,580
I just wanna let you know. If you want
me to leave tomorrow, I will, I promise.

172
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,669
Hey guys!
- Sue is here.

173
00:24:54,017 --> 00:25:00,308
Whopper. Whopper.
Whopper. Whopper. Whopper.

174
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:04,257
Okay, Chicken Tenders.

175
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,132
Careful.
Easy, easy, easy. Easy.

176
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,462
Here you go, Chicken Tender.

177
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,904
Ok. BK veggie burger.

178
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:19,808
Not that, Sue.
- Come on, it's supposed to be delicious.

179
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:24,235
I don't think so... - Come on guys,
it's got soya in it, it's good, it's really good.

180
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,362
Fine, I'll take one.

181
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:29,378
All right, hey, who wants a powerade? All right.

182
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:39,601
This is nice.
- Thanks. I've been here two years.

183
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:49,144
Compact fluorescents.
- Oh. Bummer.

184
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:55,671
So I think I'm gonna, go to sleep.

185
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,388
You want me to touch your butt first?

186
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,324
No. I only do that when I'm travelling.

187
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,426
Right.

188
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:16,199
So do you... are you alone here in Maryland
or do you have relatives around or...?
- My mom, she's over in Laurel. That...

189
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,630
Her name is Mary.
- What does she do?

190
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:23,580
She sells insurance to deaf people.

191
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,319
Nice sweatsuit.

192
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:36,287
I don't want you to take this the
wrong way but I think, we probably
shouldn't sleep in the same bed.

193
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:39,501
It's a good call.

194
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,368
So is your return ticket all set?

195
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,601
I actually don't have one.
- You don't have a return ticket?

196
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:02,291
I bought a one-way.
- Why?

197
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,042
That's completely unacceptable, Mike.
- I know.

198
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:10,106
You need to buy one.
- I know, I'm sorry. I didn't have enough money.

199
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,704
What?
- I only had enough for a one-way.

200
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,912
And I thought, I thought, 
I'm just gonna go for it.
- With me?

201
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:24,462
Yes. It was a far-flung notion.
- That was a fucking stupid notion.

202
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:27,127
I guess.
- I'll lend you the money.

203
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:29,307
No, you don't have to do that!
- Yeah, well I'm going to.

204
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:34,076
Okay, hey, would you first consider
taking a morning off from work?

205
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:37,202
No.
- We can hang out and then I'll leave.

206
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:39,673
If I don't you can... mace me.

207
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:43,246
You're insane.
- We could go to the zoo, that'd be fun.

208
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:47,284
Mike, zoos suck.
- Okay, then we'll do something else.

209
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,610
Come on Sue, take a day off from work,
you look like you could use it.

210
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:54,263
I do?

211
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,498
Have me buzz those people,
come on, let me take it!

212
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,699
Not too hard okay?

213
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,975
You shouldn't smoke.

214
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,465
I'm done. Forever. I'm serious.

215
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:28,176
No, you don't... hey! You don't need to do that.

216
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:29,274
Yeah but I am, I'm done.

217
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:31,695
It's time.

218
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:37,898
Let's see if I understand something.
Do you think that you like me, Mike?

219
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:40,375
Yes.
- Why?

220
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:42,909
Cause you have style.

221
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:44,893
No I don't.
- Yeah you do.

222
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:47,095
No, no. I don't.
- Yeah.

223
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:50,765
You give away 30% of your income.

224
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:56,131
You would to if you'd... make... more.
- No I wouldn't.

225
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:59,153
You're also incredibly sweet.

226
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:09,188
Well beneath...
- Beneath what?

227
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,505
Beneath the part of you that's not.

228
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,927
I'm gonna get you bus.

229
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:29,088
I'll pay you back for the ticket.
- Don't worry about it.

230
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:34,557
So will I ever see you again?

231
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,912
That wouldn't be good for you, Mike.
I'm not good with people.

232
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:40,333
No, that's not true.
- Yeah, I know it is.

233
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:44,958
No, it's not. What about those homeless guys?
They love you.

234
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,824
What about the soccer gals?

235
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,416
What about me?

236
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,943
Okay, buddy, all aboard.

237
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,557
Hey, Mike, I think you better go on the bus.

238
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,785
Hey Sue, it's Mike. Calling, again,
I'm trying not to call too much but,

239
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:11,303
I just wanted to make sure that you
got the poem that I sent last week

240
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,485
you know, the sort of an elongated haiku thing...

241
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:18,224
Anyway, you know my home number
and of course the front desk.

242
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:21,221
But seriously,
you should call cause I'm definitely around.

243
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,801
Anyway, talk to you later, I hope, bye.

244
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,549
I thought you were gonna quit smoking?

245
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:20,921
I just did.

246
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,078
What are you doing here?

247
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,570
Work.

248
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:34,864
Hey, did you, did you get my haiku?
- The elongated one?

249
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:38,864
Yeah.
- Yeah.

250
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,093
It was nice.

251
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,377
So you're just uh, passing through?

252
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,753
Yeah, fly out from Phoenix tomorrow.

253
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,889
Here, I'll take it.
- Oh, thank you.

254
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,476
So, this must be a really good
region for corporate art sales?

255
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,471
Yes, it is.

256
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,782
Hey, I'm supposed to go to this 
yoga class later.

257
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:13,641
Would you like to come with me?

258
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,168
Do you have a boyfriend Sue?
- No.

259
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:42,658
Did you, recently?
- Yes.

260
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,786
What was his name?
- Jango.

261
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,671
He was an ex-punk.
- Ex, like ex-punk?

262
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,127
Ex rock-punk.

263
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:55,707
We broke up when he moved away.

264
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,869
Why did he leave?

265
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:02,470
To open the Pacific northwest branch
of his organic yoghurt company.

266
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,354
He's the president.
- Here you go.

267
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,354
Thank you.

268
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:09,354
Thanks.

269
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:12,854
So how is your job these days?
- It's okay.

270
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:17,311
But it's not your fantasy job.
- I don't really do fantasy about it.

271
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:20,359
If you could close your eyes and
pick anything what would it be?

272
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,567
But you gotta close your eyes
otherwise it's not gonna work.

273
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,569
Okay.

274
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:33,538
To run a full service state
of the art soup kitchen.

275
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:39,218
Multiple housing units upstairs,
recreational facilities in the basement,

276
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,454
job outreach.

277
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:42,958
Midnight basketball.

278
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:47,030
Good soup.
- Excellent soup, first and foremost.

279
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,582
What about kids, you wanna have kids?

280
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,601
You know what was really
great about that yoga class?

281
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,525
It was the breathing stuff.

282
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:02,657
I don't do that.
- Breathe?

283
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:09,725
There are days where I have to instruct
my heart to request additional air.

284
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:17,322
And I have to tell myself:
'Breathe, Sue'.

285
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:19,486
'Just keep breathing'.

286
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:23,881
Yes, I want kids.

287
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:26,250
Were you not sure when I asked?

288
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:36,102
I just don't think that I've ever been asked.
That way. Before.

289
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:41,922
Can I ask one more question?
Then I'm done, I swear.

290
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:47,886
Will you come visit my mom
with me on the way home?

291
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:52,087
She's sick and I um, I promised I'd stop by.

292
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:57,523
Here, these are for you.
There was a flower show downtown.

293
00:36:57,524 --> 00:37:00,024
That's nice of you.

294
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:06,507
Hey ma,
Sue flew in from Baltimore just this morning.

295
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,161
What do you do, Sue?
- I sell corporate decorative art.

296
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:15,919
I've met you before.
- Yeah, you know, she stayed at the motel, ma.

297
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,074
That's how we met.

298
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:21,195
And where you're from originally?
- Uh, I'm from Columbia. Maryland.

299
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,329
Do you come from a good family?
- Uhm, no not really.

300
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:35,976
Is there something specifically wrong
with your family? - Uh, well my father
lives in ashram, in northern California.

301
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:40,162
Pretty much sums up everything.
About, you know...

302
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,095
He once forgot to pick me up from gymnastics.
For an entire night.

303
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,125
That's quite a lot of somersaults.

304
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,107
I didn't care. I didn't. It really just explains
more about him, um, than it does about me.

305
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:02,826
Could you hand me those pills, Mike?
- Which ones?

306
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,298
The ones on the left, Mike.

307
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,886
Can I talk to my son in private for a moment?
- Did I, did I say something wrong?

308
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:21,966
Not at all.
It'll just be a moment.

309
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:25,966
Okay.

310
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,740
I like her.
- Really?

311
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:40,816
She's a bit of a long shot.
But then she's logical.

312
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,696
In an emotionally annihilated kind of way.

313
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:49,126
But that's okay, underneath there
is a heart of...

314
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,603
Gold?
- No, I wouldn't say gold.

315
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:55,208
Maybe made of - leather.

316
00:38:56,732 --> 00:39:01,757
But if it works out,
she'll be good for you when I'm gone.

317
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:08,932
Needless to say what would make me
happy is for you to find something for
yourself before my check-out time.

318
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:15,481
Just so I know it's not you and your father
alone here, walking around like robots.

319
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:18,465
Ma, dad's not a robot.
- He is.

320
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,109
But I was mostly talking about you.

321
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,380
Unless you find a way out.

322
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:30,020
Of what?
- Of whatever it is you're stuck in.

323
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:38,189
You get it from your father.
He came back from the war stuck.

324
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:43,110
Been talking about joining the gym ever since.

325
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:49,282
Never has.
But that doesn't have to be you.

326
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:03,757
Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

327
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:04,957
Yeah.

328
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:09,712
She liked you.
- No she doesn't.

329
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:12,522
Yeah, she did, she told me.

330
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,170
What took you so long?

331
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,102
Dad, you remember Sue?

332
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:40,812
There's a toilet overflow in 110.

333
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:42,612
Okay.

334
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,400
Gotta get home to your mom.

335
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:23,049
Are you really leaving?
- I have to.

336
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,307
You can't stay one more night?
- I have meetings this afternoon in Seattle.

337
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:30,791
Call them off and just stay for a while.

338
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,787
It's my job.
- I know.

339
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:37,116
But you know, you could get a job around here.
- Where, Sechuan house?

340
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:39,117
No.

341
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:46,068
I'm just saying that...
- Mike, don't know how to say this...

342
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:52,156
This isn't gonna work.

343
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:56,001
I mean I'll stop by when I pass through.

344
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,446
Come on, what do you mean?

345
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:05,690
I can't move from Baltimore to live in a
corner double room of your parents motel.

346
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:10,691
I mean...

347
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:14,206
Be serious.

348
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:23,216
I'm sorry.
I'll stay in better touch this time.

349
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:24,217
Yeah, whatever you say.

350
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:04,404
So this is where she wanted?
- This used to be all scrub.

351
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,356
She'd be cringing right now if she
knew they'd be building here.

352
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,942
But. I promised her I'd do it.

353
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:22,157
Yeah, it's still nice.

354
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,911
I meant to give this to you earlier.

355
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:33,612
It's your mom's favorite piece of jewelry.
As you know she was a necklace woman.

356
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,862
She thought you should have it.
Dunno why since you won't be wearing it,

357
00:43:39,502 --> 00:43:43,474
maybe you'll find some use for it. Someday.

358
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:50,062
Thanks, dad. - Also I had some guy call me.
Wanted to buy the motel.

359
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:55,921
You're gonna do it?
- I doubt it, think we'll just keep running it.

360
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:01,196
But you can do what you like Mike.
You know, if you wanna leave...

361
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:29,425
This ain't half bad hunky-dory.
- Yeah, it was my mother's.

362
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:33,358
Oh god, it's not going down the
sentimental road. - Oh, no I'm just saying...

363
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,226
Yeah, I know what you're saying and
I know you're gonna start crying.

364
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:39,925
What? I'm not.
- How long you've been in the porn business?

365
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:44,921
The porn business? - No, pawn business.
How long you've been in the pawn business?

366
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:49,369
Oh... no, I'm uh... never... I'm...
- Exactly.

367
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:56,318
So when someone says he ain't gonna start
crying that's sure as shit sign that they are
just about to start blubbering like a calf.

368
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:07,772
See what I mean?
- Just, how much, for the necklace?

369
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:15,233
I'll give you 300.
- Phh, okay.

370
00:46:22,235 --> 00:46:24,234
Oh...
- Hi. - Hi.

371
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:28,308
I'm here to see Sue, please.
- Sue no longer works here.

372
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:32,317
I'm sorry?
- She moved to Washington.

373
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:34,895
D.C.?
- State.

374
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:38,268
Her old boyfriend came to
convince her to move to Aberdeen.

375
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:43,566
Showed up with flowers, first class plane
tickets, it was very 'officer and gentleman'.

376
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:44,265
Uh, number eight.

377
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:46,965
Eight?

378
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:53,127
Dude, I'm just messing with you.

379
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:56,960
You're new in town right?
- Oh. Yeah.

380
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:02,795
You looking for a job?
- Yeah.

381
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:12,339
You wanna work here?
- Seriously?

382
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,111
Why the fuck wouldn't I be serious?

383
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,831
Al.
- Mike.

384
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:20,044
Mike, it is nice to meet you man.
- Yeah, you too.

385
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:21,950
Dude, you stink.
- I do?

386
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:24,691
Big time.
You can't work here if you stink.

387
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:27,860
It's my parents place, they're old school
and they really hate stinky people.

388
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:34,026
So okay, go home, take a shower, please,
come back and I will get you the job.

389
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:39,408
I don't really have a home.
- Really?

390
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:48,007
All right, he also needs a place to live
so I was thinking that maybe we could
you know let him stay in the basement
and deduct some rent from his pay?

391
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,141
Great.

392
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,590
Hey thanks for helping me out,
it really means a lot.

393
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:05,672
Dude, no problem, man.

394
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:08,610
You know I've been trying to get my
folks sign someone American anyway

395
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:10,856
cause we can't less bigger bullshit that way.

396
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:13,649
Plus I freaking hate working the mornings.
- Why?

397
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,380
Because I like smoking pot and sleeping in.

398
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:19,746
Oh that's cool.
- So why did you come to Aberdeen, Mike?

399
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:26,067
Uh, this girl that I'm in love with,
she moved here to be with her ex boyfriend.

400
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:30,337
Oh, that sucks, man.
- Yeah.

401
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,787
Yeah, especially considering the guy is a punk.

402
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:38,510
Like a punk punk?
- Ex-punk, think he's older now.

403
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,292
Does he train dogs?
- I dunno.

404
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:48,915
Is his name like Jango?
- Yeah, I think it is!

405
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,771
I have totally heard of this dude, Mike.

406
00:49:50,772 --> 00:49:53,257
Is he a punk?
- No, he's an ex-punk!

407
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:01,437
So the thing with this guy right,
he's also a yoghurt magnate.
Ok, totally huge in a yoghurt business,
this guy is like a yoghurt fucking mogul.

408
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:05,216
You see those kennels over there?
That's where he keeps the dogs.

409
00:50:06,497 --> 00:50:08,114
Damn it!
- What?

410
00:50:08,115 --> 00:50:12,736
This guy, this guy is like a total stud.
- What do you mean?

411
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:17,266
I'm not a sexual superman. This guy...

412
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:17,968
I mean...

413
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:20,886
No dude, you're probably fine.
- You're just saying that.

414
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,117
Yeah, that's true but what do you want
me to say, that you're right? - No, but...

415
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:31,157
Ok, look. Now, chicks these days, they
don't want sexual supermen, ok they want
hard workers. You know, guys who hustle.

416
00:50:31,157 --> 00:50:33,006
I mean you're a fucking hustler Mike.

417
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:37,965
I mean you came all the way out
to Aberdeen dude, that's gotta
count for something right? Yeah.

418
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:42,473
This guy's got shrubbery shaped like pitbulls.

419
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,874
Dude I think I got an idea for how
you're gonna get your girl back.

420
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:26,962
Really?
- See that dude sitting over there?

421
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:29,788
He runs a flight school over in Olympia.

422
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:31,908
You should talk to him Mike.

423
00:51:38,907 --> 00:51:47,355
Ok Mike, what I need now is for you to
free your mind! So let us have a spiritually
fulfilling religious fucking moment!

424
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:50,137
I'm pretty sure I can do it Stan!

425
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:53,555
That's the Michael I've come to
know in the past eight hours!

426
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:55,368
That's the Mike!

427
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,453
Come on now!

428
00:52:08,088 --> 00:52:11,701
Three, two, one...
- Wait! Wait, Stan!

429
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:26,825
Okay now Mike, you're on your ooooooown!

430
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:59,461
Jesus! God! Jangoooo!

431
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,176
Oh my god! Who is, who is that?

432
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:07,078
It's me, Mike.

433
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:08,631
Mike?

434
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:12,285
What are you doing?
Mike, come here.

435
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,615
Jango, cut up with shooting!

436
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:18,282
What the fuck is going on!

437
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:22,006
Jango, stop shooting people! Stop it!

438
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,819
Come here, follow my hand.

439
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:26,739
Stop it!

440
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,571
Here, I got you.

441
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:33,744
Oh god, are you okay?

442
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,419
Stay away. Sue.

443
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,334
Jango, give me the gun, give me the damn gun.
- I'm gonna die.

444
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:41,957
It's just a bb gun.
- No, I really think I'm dying.

445
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:43,902
Oh my god!
- Get back, Sue. Come here.

446
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:48,370
Jango, what are you doing?
- CPR!

447
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:49,371
Oh my god I'm calling an ambulance.

448
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:54,275
Well that just looks like
you're kissing him, Jango.

449
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:18,224
Where am I?
- The Aberdeen medical center.

450
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:25,794
Did uh, did...
- Yeah, Jango shot you.

451
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,884
Which caused you to go into shock.

452
00:54:29,901 --> 00:54:35,616
Mike, why?
Why did you come out here?

453
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:38,957
Because I love you.

454
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:47,321
That... Do I have bb hose in my neck?
- Yeah.

455
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:49,143
That hurt.
- Well I can imagine.

456
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,017
I thought it was over with that guy?

457
00:54:55,057 --> 00:54:56,663
It's good for me, Mike.

458
00:54:56,664 --> 00:55:02,674
He put me in charge of his company's
non-profit yoghurt fund which allows me to
do a lot of good things for a lot of people.

459
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:08,563
He also feels horrible for shooting you and
he would like to have you over for dinner.

460
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:10,739
Oooh, that's nice.

461
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:15,766
Hey, so who's this guy?

462
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:24,986
That is me and Joe Strummer in the
summer of '79 at the 100 Club in London.

463
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:26,320
Who is Joe Strummer?

464
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:31,670
Joe Strummer most likely made love to
your mother Al and wrote a song about it.

465
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:34,556
Here's the two of us
throwing over at the CBGB's.

466
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:37,121
Hey, who is that?

467
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:42,670
Ah, that's me and Ed McMahon.
Ed Mc-Wild-Mahon.

468
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:45,395
Now he's a true punker.

469
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:55,588
Basically for me, dog work is a thrill, adrenaline
rush if you will, that's otherwise hard for
me to replicate in the world of yoghurt.

470
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:57,509
Especially now that you're not a punk.

471
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,533
Well I'll always be a punker in here, Al.
Make no mistake.

472
00:56:01,534 --> 00:56:11,799
But there's less need for me to call myself a
punker in a world where very notion of punk
then means commodified for the mass market.

473
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,828
How do you like your masala?
- It's really good.

474
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:20,904
Oh, you're not gonna eat any?
- Oh, I liquified it.

475
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:29,490
Listen, I would just like to formally and
quite sincerely apologize to you for
the BB gun incident. I lost my cool.

476
00:56:29,491 --> 00:56:35,766
I was scared, for Sue. Scared for the dogs.
Scared for the general well-being of the pool.

477
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:44,291
So I just wanna say that I'm sorry, m-m...
- Mike... - my friend.

478
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:46,066
I blundered.
- Yeah, it's alright.

479
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:49,025
Yeah so that's, behind us!

480
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:52,060
And Sue tells me that you're a painter?

481
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,123
Yeah, very, very talented painter.

482
00:56:57,308 --> 00:57:01,170
When did you have the opportunity to become
acquainted with the quality of his work, Sue?

483
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:06,945
That was my last business trip for uh,
Corporate Bliss.

484
00:57:06,946 --> 00:57:17,801
And you thought, uh "a great
opportunity to promote my art" or
you thought "beautiful woman"?

485
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:22,820
First part. The um art one.

486
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:28,335
Now so you're the guy who paints
foxes and and hounds for corporate art?

487
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:30,854
Okay, cause I got something to say about that.

488
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:35,969
You take a, a Rottweiler,
no, let's say a Malinois...

489
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,301
chasing a fox, see you've got a
seriously new dynamic on your hands

490
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:45,401
because a Malinois on a fox's ass,
that would be a trip.

491
00:57:45,402 --> 00:57:53,145
because a Malinois is gonna turn that little
fox into a fox meat inside a twenty-three
seconds, you know what I'm saying.

492
00:57:53,145 --> 00:57:56,694
So I've decided a lobby for that little bit.
- Okay.

493
00:57:56,695 --> 00:58:00,443
That was really great chicken, Jango.
- I loved that fucking chicken Jango.

494
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:04,283
You'd have a better chicken in there,
you'd have to be a rooster.

495
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,604
Speaking up, who's up for some dessert?

496
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:17,441
I got a new flavour I wanna try on you guys:
Henry Rollins' chicken-wing crunch.

497
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:28,049
Hey Sue, Mike and I are gonna go to the
Cowboy Club after this and if you want to join
us? You know they've got really great dancing.

498
00:58:28,763 --> 00:58:29,875
I'll think about it.

499
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:41,881
What I'm trying to say is that China is not
only gonna kick America's economic butt

500
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:46,681
but it's gonna invade the whole country.
I'm talking about you guys getting
like a whole new flag and whatnot.

501
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,284
You need to reorient your
way you think about Asians,

502
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:54,154
because we will blow your mind with
our uniqueness and inner beauty.

503
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,676
You think she's hot?

504
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:57,324
Yeah, sort of.

505
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:02,056
Hi, guys.
- Sue. Hi.

506
00:59:03,259 --> 00:59:04,459
Hi, Mike.

507
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:08,215
You didn't bring Jango, did you?

508
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:13,956
No, no he's got kinda drunk so,
I've just told him that I had an errand.

509
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:19,114
Hey, you wanna dance with us, Sue?
- No.

510
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:21,700
Come on, I know you got a move.
- I don't have a move.

511
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,374
Everybody's got a move, Sue.
Mike, show her your move.

512
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:26,356
I don't have a move.
- Sue, don't you think Mike's got moves?

513
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:28,615
I bet you have, a move.

514
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:30,434
Come on, let's pass some moves.

515
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:26,422
Hey, did you hear? Aberdeen is building the
biggest bio-diesel field plant in the country.

516
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:28,289
Whatever you say man.

517
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,248
No, we should find a way to get in on that.

518
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,443
Hey, Jango.

519
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:42,089
You know why I'll always be a punker man?

520
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:47,719
Cause I take very little shit.

521
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:57,030
I'm watching you man.
You stay away from her.

522
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:03,518
Mike, Mike, you all right?

523
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:08,996
I'll get him back.
- Yeah man, that is a piece of scum, man.

524
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:10,780
I think he'll regret that.

525
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:20,937
So you're sure you wanna do this?
- Look, don't come if you don't want.

526
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:21,740
Dude.

527
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:23,220
I'm with you.

528
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:25,588
Okay, let's do it.

529
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:05,792
Dude, that was awesome!

530
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:07,794
Just...

531
01:03:12,592 --> 01:03:15,592
Wait, wait. Drop. Go go go go!

532
01:03:15,593 --> 01:03:16,493
Hold on. Shit!

533
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:18,334
I love you, Sue!

534
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:22,517
Hear that old man!
You suck.

535
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:40,415
Mike, you have visitor.
- Okay.

536
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,988
We need to talk, Mike.
- I know.

537
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:05,322
I've been leaving you messages.

538
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:13,219
Did you tell him about us?
- Yes.

539
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,125
Why?

540
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,771
Because I'm marrying him.

541
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,014
What?

542
01:04:22,323 --> 01:04:24,357
Which I need you to accept.

543
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:25,915
Why?

544
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:30,797
Because I'm at a point in my life where
there are certain things that I need.

545
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:31,689
Like what?

546
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,619
Like a certain kind of love.

547
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,155
What kind?

548
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:39,497
The kind that is not like an unguided missile.

549
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:43,374
You can't just stalk people around the country.

550
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:46,537
You can't parachute into people's pools.

551
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:51,623
Knock on people's motel rooms
just because you're feeling lonely.

552
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:54,527
Life isn't like that.

553
01:04:55,262 --> 01:05:01,241
Freedom to be with someone.
It's not all about what you need.

554
01:05:01,558 --> 01:05:06,037
It's got to be more selfless than that.
Mike, it's got to be more selfless than that.

555
01:05:06,038 --> 01:05:11,184
Oh, like, like save everyone else
in the world except yourself?

556
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:13,824
I don't, that's not what I do.
- Yes you do.

557
01:05:13,825 --> 01:05:15,573
No. It's not.
- Yes it is!

558
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:21,275
You're so busy being selfless that
you end up treating yourself like shit.

559
01:05:22,057 --> 01:05:23,813
That really what you think of me?

560
01:05:23,814 --> 01:05:28,486
I'm just, I'm just saying... 
I know what you need.

561
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:32,424
Which is what?
- To take care of yourself a little.

562
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:37,702
So that the people who love you
don't feel like they're annoying you.

563
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:44,220
Sue, Sue, just, marry me.

564
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:48,620
Hey, let's just let the world go
screw itself for a half second.

565
01:05:48,621 --> 01:05:51,806
And just see what happens
and maybe it'll be okay.

566
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,586
I'm getting married on Saturday.
- Why?

567
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:03,755
Cause I'm pregnant.

568
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:14,007
And I'm gonna have it.
It's what I want.

569
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:19,927
You're having a child?

570
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,474
Could it be mine?

571
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:28,779
No.

572
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:37,724
Which is why I'm getting married.

573
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:44,687
Mike I can't afford to be selfish on this one.

574
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:50,815
I just have to be with somebody who
knows what they're doing with their life.

575
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:55,775
I'm sorry.

576
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,712
Sweet just doesn't cut it.

577
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:13,267
Can you leave now, please?

578
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:17,824
Just leave, okay.

579
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,012
Get out of my basement, Sue.

580
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:29,463
Susan, I'm serious.
Get the fuck out of my basement right now!

581
01:08:29,534 --> 01:08:32,482
I wish I had that dick's bb gun right now.

582
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,110
They're going on a honeymoon?
- I don't know.

583
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:40,888
Yeah, they'll probably wait
till the yoghurt season's over.

584
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:54,037
You're gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

585
01:08:56,822 --> 01:09:04,962
I just wanna say Al,
you're the best friend I ever had.

586
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:07,936
Ditto.

587
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:18,156
What a douchebag huh?

588
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:25,346
You know that's enough to make
you want to be a buddhist monk.

589
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:28,463
My people are really good at that stuff.

590
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:29,464
Yeah?

591
01:09:36,652 --> 01:09:40,148
Oh dude, don't get carried away.

592
01:10:48,901 --> 01:10:54,503
Michael, the progress you've made in
your 4 months here has been remarkable.

593
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:55,504
Thank you, father.

594
01:10:55,505 --> 01:11:03,117
Needless to say your immersion in the
duty of carriage shopper and boon chief
has been full and complete. - Thank you.

595
01:11:04,069 --> 01:11:07,371
But some worries have arisen.
- Such as what, father?

596
01:11:07,372 --> 01:11:10,033
First of all you're not supposed 
to call me father.

597
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:15,568
But I must say, I must admit I grow 
fond of it.

598
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,570
Michael...

599
01:11:18,747 --> 01:11:26,714
An aspiring buddhist monk such
as yourself should seek to produce
a heart that does not dwell.

600
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:28,387
Of course, father.

601
01:11:28,672 --> 01:11:33,232
And your heart Michael, may I say, does dwell.

602
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:35,156
No it doesn't.
- It does, Michael.

603
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:39,068
You have not transcended
your earthly passions.

604
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:43,912
To put it bluntly: you are stuck!

605
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,372
You also spend too much time playing volleybal.

606
01:11:47,373 --> 01:11:49,708
Yeah but I thought that was permitted father.

607
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:55,120
Yes but not for seven hours a day.
- Also you encouraged it for stress release.

608
01:11:55,121 --> 01:12:03,956
Yes, I, I did. Yes. But uh, Michael,
buddhists monks aren't supposed to
have seven hours a day worth of stress.

609
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:07,876
We are buddhist monks. Buddhist monks.

610
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:14,313
So what should I do?

611
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,187
My parents died when I was ten.

612
01:12:18,188 --> 01:12:21,834
Two months later my uncle
and I moved to America.

613
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:25,929
I was forced to let go of everything I knew.
In order to move on.

614
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:30,870
Sometimes in life, you must do that.

615
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:34,769
Where are you from, father?

616
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:39,689
Vietnam. Hau Liang province?

617
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:43,653
My parents were killed in a war.

618
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:47,208
By the Americans?
- Yes.

619
01:12:48,178 --> 01:12:50,237
And yet I moved here.

620
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,767
I like this park.

621
01:12:57,738 --> 01:13:00,892
I'm sorry.
- No no no.

622
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:02,973
It is not your fault.

623
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:09,267
Let go, Michael.
Let go and move on.

624
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:27,756
I reckon I knew you. - Yeah, I'm the
guy who sold you my mom's necklace.

625
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:28,758
Oh yes, right.

626
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:32,704
What can I do you for?
- I want it back.

627
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:53,566
Dad, do you want me to make you
some dinner? - No, I'm all right.

628
01:15:05,642 --> 01:15:14,210
Dad, when you were over in Vietnam, did you
ever do any fighting in the Hau Liang province?

629
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:23,097
Yeah. Why?

630
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:30,782
I just met this guy at the
monastery who was from the area.

631
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:35,441
Seemed to really have his shit together.

632
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,527
Good to hear.

633
01:15:54,198 --> 01:15:57,144
Dad, I been thinking,
maybe you should sell this place.

634
01:15:58,425 --> 01:16:00,326
You don't even like it here.

635
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:02,124
This was mom's thing.

636
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:04,570
Why do you say that?

637
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:06,001
Cause it's true.

638
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,840
My mom loved people,
loved running things, it's not like you.

639
01:16:11,841 --> 01:16:15,141
You're not like a people's person, dad.

640
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:17,725
You should let it go.

641
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:20,001
Move on.

642
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,539
Otherwise you're just gonna rot.

643
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,208
Sell it and do what?
- Anything.

644
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:27,202
You've still got time.
You've got money.

645
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:31,562
What do you need Mike? A loan.

646
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:39,287
No. I just wanted to say,
that this doesn't have to be it.

647
01:16:42,526 --> 01:16:44,434
And that I love you.

648
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:11,309
Dear Mike, I know you probably don't want
to hear from me and I can't say I blame you.

649
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:14,902
But I wanted to write anyway
to let you know what I think.

650
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:18,434
Which is that I think you had a point that day.

651
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:21,469
About people who hide behind their causes.

652
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,985
in order to avoid their lives

653
01:17:27,134 --> 01:17:32,056
You had a point down there in that basement.
With the soy sauce and the mice.

654
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:37,018
And so I wanted to say thanks.

655
01:17:38,882 --> 01:17:42,301
Because of you Mike,
I'm not the same person I was.

656
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,324
Goodbye, Mike.
Love, Sue.

657
01:17:53,505 --> 01:17:56,534
Just thought about what you said the other day.

658
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:57,293
I think you had a point.

659
01:18:02,787 --> 01:18:06,335
That being said, this is yours.

660
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,509
What is it?
- Deed to the motel. Signed over to you.

661
01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:17,900
Dad. Dad, that's not why....
- It's fine.

662
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:20,545
I don't need it.

663
01:18:21,767 --> 01:18:27,097
Your mom was good about that.
- You can't just give me the motel.

664
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:28,360
It's your birth right.

665
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:32,219
What would you do?

666
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,520
I want to get in shape.

667
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:38,552
Maybe join one of those basketball leagues.

668
01:18:39,662 --> 01:18:43,973
How about you?
- I don't know. I'll think of something.

669
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:51,215
You done with the monk stuff?
- Yeah, I still ocassionally do it.

670
01:18:52,564 --> 01:18:55,152
I mean not professionally but...

671
01:18:58,089 --> 01:18:59,759
What about that girl?

672
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,259
Oh, that didn't work out.

673
01:19:05,218 --> 01:19:10,337
We weren't, you know, like,
meant for each other.

674
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:16,377
I dunno Mike, things change. In life.

675
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:20,119
What do you mean?

676
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,005
You're not the same guy you were.

677
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:31,868
Good soup.

678
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,092
Good soup.

679
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,182
You can do this, Mike.

680
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,595
I'm gonna hit the gym.

681
01:20:02,036 --> 01:20:05,215
Yeah, they have a senior
citizens hoop run from 3 to 5.

682
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:08,424
I got a new ball.

683
01:20:08,425 --> 01:20:09,887
Yeah, I see it.

684
01:20:11,709 --> 01:20:14,342
All right, Mike.
- See ya.

685
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:29,235
Hallo?
- Hi Jango, it's Mike, Sue's friend.

686
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,492
Hi Mike.

687
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:36,712
Hi. Look I know that I'm probably not the guy
you want to hear from right now but I need
to tell Sue about what I'm doing down here.

688
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:41,817
And I think that when she hears what
I'm up to... - Hey Mike? - ...she will at
least understand that if nothing else...

689
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:42,717
Mike?
- Yeah?

690
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:48,946
We split up, Sue and I. Split up.
She left me.

691
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:51,916
Went back to Maryland
to be with her mom.

692
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,920
Hi
- Hi.

693
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:32,569
Are you Mary Claussen?
- Yes?

694
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:34,572
Hi
- Hi.

695
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,274
I'm a friend of Sue's.
Is she home?

696
01:21:37,622 --> 01:21:42,158
Who are you?
- Mike? From management.

697
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:48,623
Sue, Mike is here.

698
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:15,626
Hi.
- Hi.

699
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,013
How's the baby?

700
01:22:24,074 --> 01:22:25,944
So far so good.

701
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,011
Are you okay?

702
01:22:41,476 --> 01:22:43,561
I'm really sorry, Mike.

703
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:44,984
For what?

704
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:49,088
Cause I really messed up. With you.

705
01:22:49,246 --> 01:22:52,979
But you were right. I was like a kid.

706
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:01,708
This is the deed to the motel.

707
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:09,844
I want to turn it into a homeless
shelter with midnight basketball.

708
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:13,798
I already bought the soup noodles.

709
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:23,483
I was actually hoping that
you might want to help.

710
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:36,329
I really love you Sue and I want to take care
of you and whoever it is that's inside of you.

711
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:45,234
All I want is to be with you. That's it.

712
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:58,384
Breathe, Sue.

713
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:01,824
Just keep breathing.

714
01:24:14,581 --> 01:24:18,730
I wrote you a haiku, you wanna hear it?

715
01:24:19,741 --> 01:24:20,886
Sure.

716
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:31,682
Mike, oh Mike, my man.
Keeps showing up like UPS.

717
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,352
Sue, you're such a bitch.

718
01:24:38,308 --> 01:24:39,953
I like it.

719
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,854
You do?
- Yeah.

720
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:55,758
THE END
