1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, no. Here comes a speech.

2
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:16,253
Just when I started to enjoy myself.

3
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,215
Andy...

4
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:22,550
...all my life I've dreamed of...

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,303
...packing up and leaving the city
and the newspaper business behind.

6
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,181
What stopped you, Jack?
Give it a shot.

7
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,017
And moving to some quiet little town
in the country...

8
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:33,936
...and putting down on paper...

9
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,272
...the novel I know I have inside of me.

10
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,983
That's not a novel, Jack. It's heartburn.

11
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,404
But for one reason or another,
I never followed that dream.

12
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:44,738
No talent.

13
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,824
And to be honest with myself,
I probably never will.

14
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:49,325
Thank God for that.

15
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:51,869
But you are, Andy.

16
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:54,372
You're gonna live out
that dream for me...

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,166
...and possibly for every man
seated around this table.

18
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,876
Not me.

19
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:02,213
So, Andy, I believe...

20
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:06,718
...I speak to the feelings
in all our hearts when I say to you:

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,302
"You son of a bitch. "

22
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,183
Seriously...

23
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,852
...we'll miss you, Andy.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,397
Good sports writers are hard to find.

25
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:25,819
- Lord knows, I have never found one.
Hey, hey, hey.

26
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:30,948
Well, I guess I wouldn't be much of
a newspaper man if I didn't know that...

27
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:35,745
...all of this cynicism merely masks
deeper feelings of resentment and envy.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,082
But seriously, this is really great and...

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,625
...I'm touched.
Hey, Andy.

30
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:45,254
- What's the book gonna be about?
- About 300 pages, Harry.

31
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:47,590
Show them the check, Andy.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,259
Merely an advance...

33
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:54,137
...of $10,000.
- Oh, that should cover your airfare back.

34
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:56,765
As the heir apparent
to your Giants season tickets...

35
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:59,059
...I wish you all the success in the world.

36
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,685
Don't get your hopes up, Ray.

37
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,772
He'll be back before the preseason ends,
if he goes at all.

38
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,941
No, I don't think so.
This move is for keeps.

39
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,943
That's what Billy Martin said.

40
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:12,197
Elizabeth and I have made a commitment.

41
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,240
- We're even gonna start a family.
- My God. More Andy Farmers.

42
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:18,911
Yeah, give it a shot.
- So even if I wanted to move back...

43
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,871
...Elizabeth would never let us.

44
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:27,795
- All set?
- Yes.

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,714
Give me a kiss.

46
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,093
We're off.

47
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:37,387
Redbud, here we come.

48
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:13,839
Hey, there's our movers.

49
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,470
Hey, fellas!

50
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,806
See you up there!

51
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,393
- Who the hell was that?
- How should I know?

52
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:31,245
Elizabeth?

53
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,836
Look at these. These are even better.

54
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:42,381
Oh, by far.

55
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,347
Let's get out of here.

56
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,726
- This is the best one yet.
- We can trade it for a "railroad crossing. "

57
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:52,574
Woo-hoo!

58
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:12,134
Am I crazy or is it even prettier
than when we bought it?

59
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,719
No. You're right.

60
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,345
I am right, it is prettier.

61
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:19,098
And, look, the ducks are still here.

62
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:22,602
I think they must live here, Andy.

63
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:23,936
That means they're ours.

64
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,899
How about that, Elizabeth?
We own ducks.

65
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,027
We're duck owners.

66
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,698
I bet I could reach in there
with my bare hands and pull out a fish.

67
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,326
Come on, let's go inside.

68
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,921
Wait. This is our first real house.
I'll carry you in.

69
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,717
I heard that.
- Nonsense. You're light as a feather.

70
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,845
Jeez!

71
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,390
Honey! Oh, God, are you all right?
Oh, I'm sorry.

72
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:06,644
Oh, baby. It's that damn door.

73
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:09,730
Sweetie pie, I'm sorry.

74
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:12,691
- Are you better? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

75
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,194
- Okay.
- Yeah.

76
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,945
Well...

77
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,741
...welcome to our new home.

78
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,492
Come on.

79
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:30,792
I wonder how long it would take
for an ambulance to reach us out here.

80
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,304
Let me see that map again.

81
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,023
Which way does it go?

82
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,900
Don't ask me. I'm the assistant.

83
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,985
Where's north? Which is south?

84
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,656
Maybe this.

85
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,408
Who the hell drew this map?

86
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,288
Juice is on.

87
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,625
Water's on. Everything's on track in here.

88
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,085
No phone.

89
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:18,170
No phone.
They didn't install the phone.

90
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,173
They were supposed to install
a sandstone-beige wall phone...

91
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:24,468
...next to this window.
- I don't get it.

92
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:28,430
I ordered that phone in writing a month
in advance. I paid a $50 deposit.

93
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,891
Be that as it may, Andy,
there's no telephone in this kitchen.

94
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,229
Well, 200 years ago, the settlers lived
their entire lives without telephones.

95
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,274
We can manage a day or two
till I get this straightened out.

96
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,401
Okay. Then let's get something to eat.

97
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,653
You can't be hungry already.

98
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:46,072
Honey, we ate hours ago.

99
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,492
As soon as the movers arrive and unload,
we'll zip into Redbud...

100
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,828
...for an old-fashioned home-cooked meal.

101
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:54,079
Whatever you say.

102
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:15,683
Hey, Mac. Which way to Redbud?

103
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,060
How'd you know my name was Mac?

104
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:19,854
Just guessed.

105
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,523
Then why don't you guess
your way to Redbud?

106
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,290
Elizabeth?

107
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,167
Yeah.

108
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:45,212
My writing room.
Tell me what you think.

109
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,883
Originally I thought I should put my desk
here so I could look out over the pond.

110
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:52,177
Then I thought,
no, too many distractions.

111
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:55,180
So I should put the desk over here
facing this way...

112
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:58,599
...and I can put the bookshelves
over there. What do you think?

113
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,686
Well, I'll tell you what.

114
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,278
Come here, look at this.

115
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,034
What is that, a finch? A lark?

116
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,830
I think it's a sparrow, Andy.

117
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,123
It's perfect.

118
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,708
Isn't it perfect, Elizabeth?

119
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,419
A bird's nest right outside
my writing room window.

120
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,924
Oh, Andy. I don't think I've ever
seen you this happy before.

121
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,843
Well, why shouldn't I be happy?

122
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,637
We bought a house in the country.
Gonna write my novel.

123
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,305
We're gonna start a new family.

124
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,892
When was the last time we horsed around
in the middle of the day?

125
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,562
Six years ago when we were both
down with the flu.

126
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,356
That's too long.

127
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,778
Now?

128
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,488
Here?

129
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,949
Yes, on both counts.

130
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,201
Shouldn't we wait for the bed to arrive?

131
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,538
Oh, no. The settlers 200 years ago
never needed beds.

132
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,833
No sense breaking with tradition now.

133
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,004
Listen.

134
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,968
What was that?

135
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,637
I didn't hear anything.

136
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,307
No.

137
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,312
It's them.

138
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,356
The movers are here.

139
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:38,612
Terrific.

140
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,742
Maybe now we can eat.

141
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,830
Andy?

142
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,290
Hey. Andy?

143
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:05,304
Andy, look out!

144
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:13,311
- Honey, are you all right?
- Jesus. What the hell was that?

145
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,605
Who was that maniac?

146
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,277
What is it, a death threat?

147
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,862
No, it's a letter...

148
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,824
...addressed to the people we bought
the house from, the Musselmans.

149
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:30,911
- A letter?
- This is mail, Andy.

150
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:34,581
That maniac is our mailman.

151
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,502
I guess there's a lot we'll have to
get used to around here.

152
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:43,382
But I bet those are just the things
we come to love the mo...

153
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,716
What was that for?

154
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,635
A mosquito.

155
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,637
Honest.

156
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:11,575
Let me have a try.

157
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,710
Pardon me, sir.

158
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:25,880
- Could you give us some assistance, please?
- Yeah. Glad to help.

159
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:28,842
We're looking for Dog Creek Road.

160
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,927
That would be near the town of Redbud.

161
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:35,432
If I was going to Dog Creek Road,
I sure as hell wouldn't start from here.

162
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,434
But supposing you had to?

163
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,604
Well, then I'd swing around and go back
the way you came.

164
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:47,401
But this time, turn right
where the old Hollenshed barn used to be.

165
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:52,239
Then about five miles
before the road dead-ends, veer left...

166
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:56,618
...and follow the railroad tracks
straight into a town called Beaver Mills.

167
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:03,332
Or you could take the bridge at the fork in
the road and save yourself a heap of time.

168
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,631
But I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

169
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,395
This ain't a bridge.

170
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,648
- It's termites holding hands.
- We're going over it.

171
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,318
Not me. I wouldn't go over this thing
on a skateboard.

172
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:34,821
We're going over it. Have faith
in the craftsmanship of our forefathers.

173
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:38,325
Your forefathers, not my forefathers.

174
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,869
Oh, Lord.

175
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,639
This is insane. What are we doing, man?

176
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,474
We're just movers.
That's all. We're just movers.

177
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,268
No one gets paid for this shit.

178
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,276
Go back, go back, go back!

179
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:17,987
Go back, go back, go back.

180
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,241
It's over. It's over, man.

181
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:26,203
- Forefathers, my ass!
- Shut up. You're making me nervous.

182
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,828
Any sign of them?

183
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,453
Nope.

184
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:14,249
I think it's gonna be a sneak attack.

185
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,461
Where'd you get that?

186
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,339
From the picnic basket.

187
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,175
Anything else?

188
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:27,095
No. This was the last of it.
One banana.

189
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,182
- That's all. I'm sorry.
- No.

190
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,935
I thought I saw an apple.

191
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:38,355
Nope. Just this.

192
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:47,489
Mickey?

193
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:51,202
Yeah.
You still got that map?

194
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,787
Yeah.
Don't lose it.

195
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:57,624
It might be the piece of evidence
that gets me off a murder charge.

196
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,751
Who you gonna kill, Crocker?

197
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,420
The son of a bitch who drew that map.

198
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:38,162
When they say
hardwood floors, what they really mean is...

199
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,916
...hard, wood floors.

200
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:46,045
Oh, it's not so bad. It's warm
in here. We have a roof over our heads.

201
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:57,598
Think about the settlers 200 years ago.

202
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,517
They slept under the stars
and bathed in icy streams.

203
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:03,979
And they lived to an average age of 29.

204
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:16,700
Come here.

205
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:24,748
Close your eyes
and try to get some sleep.

206
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,285
Hey.

207
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,372
They're here.

208
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,124
Be civil.

209
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,049
Well, it's about time!

210
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,469
Where the hell have you guys been?

211
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,678
Oh, man.

212
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,555
- You hear that?
- Didn't hear a thing.

213
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:10,642
I'll have somebody's ass for this!
- Perhaps you heard that.

214
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,601
- Nope.
- You're a day late, damn it!

215
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,355
We had to sleep on the floor last night!
Where the hell have you idiots been?

216
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:19,650
- Or that?
- I don't know what to say. I'm at a loss.

217
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,654
I have a contract. Says if you're late,
you get a rebate. Well, you guys are late.

218
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,199
And I want more than a rebate.
I want a goddamn refund!

219
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,159
Somebody answer me!

220
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,620
- We got lost.
- Lost?

221
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:35,498
How could you get lost?
I drew you a map!

222
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,171
Okay. That's more like it.

223
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:46,426
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- This one?

224
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:49,345
Good choice.

225
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:51,973
Follow me.

226
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:55,268
Okay, that goes in my writing room.

227
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,853
It's on the second floor,
last room on the left.

228
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,689
That is top-quality leather.
Watch it going up the stairs.

229
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:04,401
Also, we just had the floors done
so I don't want scratches and scrapes.

230
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:07,320
Just take it easy on the floors, okay?

231
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,824
Hey! Fella, hey!

232
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:12,701
Wait!

233
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,453
Stop!

234
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:22,793
You slept on the floor, huh?

235
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,839
We slept outside
with the bugs and the wild animals.

236
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,883
A bridge nearly killed us.

237
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,053
Nobody knows where the hell Redbud is.
And we haven't eaten since yesterday.

238
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:37,141
So stay the hell out of our way
and keep your mouth shut!

239
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,395
Sounds fair.

240
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,125
How's it going?

241
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:07,753
Fine. Great.

242
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:10,255
That's good.

243
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:16,553
Well, back to work.

244
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,479
Yeah.

245
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,248
Hey, Andy?
- What?

246
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,041
Come down here, Andy! Hurry!

247
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,903
Andy?

248
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,405
- Andy?
- What?

249
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,872
- I found the phone.
- Good.

250
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:59,291
Call the movers. I'm not spending
another night in this house.

251
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:02,628
- Why? What happened?
- There's a coffin in the garden.

252
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:05,422
- Operator.
Sheriff's office, please.

253
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,885
Yes, sir. I can connect you with the sheriff
if you will kindly deposit 20 cents.

254
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:12,471
- This isn't a pay phone.
- Please, sir.

255
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:16,475
Deposit 20 cents in the slot
and I'll complete your call as requested.

256
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:20,395
You don't understand. This is Mr. Farmer.
We just moved into the Musselman place.

257
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,189
You were supposed to install
a wall phone in the kitchen.

258
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,359
Please, sir, just drop a couple of dimes
in the slot...

259
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,320
...and I will happily complete your call
as requested.

260
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,072
What slot? There is no slot.

261
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,490
Haven't you been listening?

262
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:37,120
This is not a pay phone! This is a goddamn
1948 table model with a 12" cord...

263
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,455
...that some jackass put in my cabinet!

264
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:43,583
Disconnect. Vulgar and abusive language,
that's an automatic disconnect.

265
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,172
- Operator.
Yes, hello.

266
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,675
This is Dr. Grail from the...

267
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:55,762
...Utilities Commission. May I speak with
the sheriff? We have a fire. It's urgent.

268
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,014
Nice try, Mr. Farmer.

269
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,773
Sheriff's office, please.

270
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,651
You gotta get up earlier in the morning
than that, Farmer.

271
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,698
I know the sound of two pennies being
dropped into a jelly jar when I hear it.

272
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,409
Listen to me. This is Elizabeth Farmer.

273
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,496
We have a corpse in the garden. Now
get ahold of the sheriff this very minute.

274
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,833
Yup.

275
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,460
That's a casket, all right.

276
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:32,797
See? It's nothing to be upset about. It's out
of the ground. It'll be gone in a moment.

277
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,091
What's this gonna cost me, fellas?

278
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,054
Dirk, what is our charge
for excavating mortal remains?

279
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:42,557
I guess we better bill them by the pound.

280
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,392
Careful, boy.

281
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,603
Don't look.

282
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:52,983
Take a look at this.

283
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:01,533
That's Claude Musselman.

284
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:04,578
- I recognize the glass eye.
- I knew it.

285
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:08,165
I knew Eula would get
the last word in somehow.

286
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,833
What do you mean?

287
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:15,046
Claude used to alley-cat around town
with a widow named Dorita Freeburger.

288
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:17,590
When he died, he left the house to Eula...

289
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:19,467
...and $10,000 to Dorita.

290
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:22,553
I guess that made Eula mad enough
to stuff Claude in this...

291
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,889
...cheap pine box
and plant him in the garden.

292
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,850
Having the last word's
real important around here.

293
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:32,896
Boys, take him over to the cemetery
and I'll see that he gets a proper burial.

294
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,773
Right away.

295
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:38,944
Ma'am, could I trouble you for
a shovel and some plastic GLAD Bags?

296
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:43,031
I'll get them.

297
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:50,372
Thanks for all your trouble.

298
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,667
I'd say the worst is behind you now,
but be careful where you dig in the future.

299
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:58,254
I believe Claude had a mule
that's still unaccounted for.

300
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,297
Thanks for the tip.

301
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,842
Any other problems, just let me know.

302
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,427
No, I think that'll do it.
- No.

303
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,514
No. No, it won't.

304
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:13,519
Our mailman tried to run us down with his
truck and threw our mail out into the road.

305
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:16,188
You're on Crum Petree's route,
aren't you?

306
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:20,316
The problem is, your place is five miles
off his regular route.

307
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:25,071
By the time he gets all the way out to here,
he's pretty well liquored up and pissed off.

308
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,906
My advice is...

309
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,616
...learn to live with it.

310
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:33,413
- Well, I'll have a talk with him.
- Yes. You do that, Mr. Farmer.

311
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:37,584
You two have yourselves a nice little chat.
Ike, let's go.

312
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,209
Thank you, ma'am.

313
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:42,087
Does the sheriff always ride around
in a taxi?

314
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:44,631
Yup. Ever since he
flunked his driving test.

315
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:01,314
Andy, have we made a terrible mistake?

316
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:02,565
Of course not.

317
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:11,240
I know things haven't gone
completely according to plan so far.

318
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:13,951
We just have to adjust our thinking.

319
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,163
We didn't move here
for a change of scenery, did we?

320
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:19,582
No.

321
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,500
We moved here for a change of heart.

322
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:26,504
But it's gonna take a little effort
on our parts.

323
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:30,842
Come on, what do you say?

324
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,636
Give it a chance.

325
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,221
Okay.

326
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:37,515
I'll make an effort.

327
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:40,852
- I promise.
- Good.

328
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,977
I'm gonna do a little fishing.

329
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:27,939
I'm going fishing.

330
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,524
- Done writing?
- I'm taking a break.

331
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:33,860
I thought I'd try my luck at the pond,
maybe catch us some lunch.

332
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:36,029
Great. Have fun.

333
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,323
How are you doing?

334
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:45,539
- How are you doing?
- Me? I'm doing great.

335
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:48,166
I love the country.

336
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:57,258
Sorry, fellas.

337
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:06,809
Hey, honey?

338
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,770
I got one.

339
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,106
Where you going? Where you going?

340
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:14,607
You wanna fight, do you?

341
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:18,820
Christ! Get it off!

342
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:21,489
Get... Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

343
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,369
It's caught on me! Elizabeth!

344
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:48,557
Oh, no.

345
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,685
Honey.

346
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,954
It's all my fault. I've been so busy writing,
I didn't realize how cooped up you've been.

347
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:15,792
We're gonna get out
and make some friends, circulate.

348
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,252
Become part of the community.

349
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,672
- I guess.
- That's a girl.

350
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,843
"Founder's Day picnic. Softball. "

351
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,303
Sounds like fun.

352
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:30,430
- Wanna go?
- Don't think so.

353
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,815
There's an antique store.

354
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:43,692
"Ethel Dinges Antiques. "
Let's take a look.

355
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,207
Hon, you know you don't enjoy
this sort of thing.

356
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,544
- You go to the ball game. I'll find you later.
- No, I don't mind.

357
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:07,173
Well, okay.

358
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:08,842
- Here, you keep the car.
- Okay.

359
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,635
- Take your time.
- All right.

360
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:13,304
- See you at the picnic.
- Okay.

361
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,067
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thanks.

362
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,444
Two hot dogs, please.

363
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:34,032
You might as well pay.
I'll beat you.

364
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:42,291
Go, go, go.

365
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,377
- Yeah!
- Let's get them, Redbud.

366
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:55,845
Come on, let's go. One more.

367
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,221
Good job, Redbud.

368
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:00,766
All right.
- Second base.

369
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:02,852
Let's get the batter up.

370
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:13,987
Play ball!

371
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:18,325
Strike!

372
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:22,245
Lotterhand, what day is it?

373
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:23,872
Come on, Redbud!

374
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,253
Strike!

375
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,381
Here we go.

376
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,884
Come on. Put it in there.

377
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:39,970
All right. Yeah.

378
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:41,764
I got it.

379
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:44,433
Strike three.

380
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,980
Gee. Sorry, Marion.

381
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,607
Run, you idiot, run!
He dropped the third strike!

382
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,442
Somebody pick up the ball!

383
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:56,778
Somebody get the ball!

384
00:34:57,446 --> 00:35:00,156
What the hell is this?
Gus called three strikes.

385
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:02,492
Somebody pick up the damn ball!

386
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,331
Safe!

387
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,625
What's the matter with you,
are you blind?

388
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,087
I call them as I see them.
He's got the ball here...

389
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,880
Get an ambulance.

390
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:21,343
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

391
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,888
- This is nice.
- Isn't it, though?

392
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,849
That belonged to my sister.

393
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:29,309
She's dead.

394
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:32,729
Oh, sorry.

395
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,606
We were very close.

396
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:38,567
This cup is all I have to remember her by.

397
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:42,405
Everything else was lost in the explosion.

398
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:52,665
This is perfect.
How much are you asking?

399
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:57,044
That belonged to my husband.
It was his favorite chair.

400
00:35:57,212 --> 00:36:00,130
He would come home
from a hard day on the railroad...

401
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:04,175
...and just rock and rock.

402
00:36:04,343 --> 00:36:08,221
I can almost see him in it now.
I don't believe...

403
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,807
...a soul has sat in that chair...

404
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:13,435
...since the day his heart attacked him.

405
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:20,482
It'll be all right.
Ma, is he dead?

406
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:35,289
Well, that's that.
Forget the fishing derby, boys.

407
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:37,750
- How come?
- Without Marion, we're a man short.

408
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:41,086
Rules say four men in a boat.

409
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:52,889
I'm glad to help out, fellas.

410
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,266
I hope this won't take too long.

411
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:58,186
My wife's gonna come down... Ah!

412
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:05,567
Hey!

413
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:12,783
You must be new to Redbud.

414
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:15,077
Just moved up from New York.

415
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:17,496
How do you like it so far?

416
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:20,290
Oh, it's lovely.

417
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:25,629
No, that's not true. It's just awful.

418
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:34,303
Everything just seems to be going wrong.

419
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:37,556
Bugs...

420
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,225
...snakes...

421
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:42,812
...dead bodies.
- Oh, dear.

422
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,898
We had such high hopes.

423
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:49,609
Of course you did. Of course you did.

424
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:53,238
Everything will work out. You'll see.

425
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,240
Why don't we sit down here...

426
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:58,493
...and I'll make us a nice
cold pitcher of iced tea.

427
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,078
No, I don't wanna trouble you.

428
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:04,499
Nonsense. Now you sit down here
and I'll be right back.

429
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,880
- Ah!
- What is it?

430
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,552
He won't hurt you, dear. He's stuffed.

431
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,222
He... He just startled me, that's all.

432
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,558
- I'll take him away.
- No, no.

433
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,643
No, I'm all right now.

434
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,187
I'll be right back.

435
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:58,884
Oh, boy.

436
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:15,984
Jesus, Brock, I'm sorry!

437
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:18,110
What happened?
- I hooked his neck.

438
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:21,489
No, don't pull on it.
You'll rip his damn veins out.

439
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:22,781
He'll bleed to death.

440
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:25,034
Take it easy. You're just making it worse.

441
00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:27,161
- Let me see it!
- Stay away from me.

442
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,247
- We gotta get the hook out. Hold still!
- Get away! Get away!

443
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:32,625
- You've got to hold still!
- Get away from me!

444
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,335
- Gotta knock him out.
- What?

445
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,545
It's the only way to get the hooks out.

446
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,547
Sorry, Brock, it's for your own good.

447
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:41,466
Will you cut that out?

448
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:45,386
- You bastard!
It's not working.

449
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:48,139
You're not knocking him out,
you're beating him up.

450
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,807
- Sons of bitches!
- Hold still!

451
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:52,894
- He sure is tough.
- Somebody else take a swing.

452
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:55,480
I only hooked him in the neck,
I'm not trying to kill him.

453
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:59,943
- Help me pull his hands away from his face.
- Hey, I got a strike.

454
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,902
I'm gonna kill you for this.

455
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm sorry, Brock.
It's for your own good.

456
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,661
Oh, Jesus. Fellas, I'm sorry!

457
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,125
That's cold.

458
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:20,128
Hey, look.

459
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:21,880
It fell out.

460
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,799
- No need to thank me.
- Grab him.

461
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,718
- I was only trying to help.
- He's mine.

462
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,137
If you come to get me, I'll be ready!

463
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,807
I don't work! I don't sleep!

464
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,935
Damn.

465
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,589
Mrs. Farmer? Mrs. Farmer?

466
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:10,509
I've been looking for you, Mrs. Farmer.
Can I speak to you for a minute?

467
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,350
I got something here for you,
Mrs. Farmer.

468
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,019
Try again tomorrow, sheriff?

469
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,980
Hello, sheriff. What is it?

470
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,566
The bill for Claude Musselman's funeral.

471
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,237
Four thousand dollars?

472
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,992
I'd call it a bargain. He got the most
scenic plot in Memorial Cemetery.

473
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,912
For $4,000, we could have had him
stuffed and mounted over the fireplace.

474
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,625
I thought you'd wanna give him
the best burial money could buy.

475
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,544
Frankly, I don't see how any of this
is our respons...

476
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:13,569
- Can we discuss this some other time?
- If you like.

477
00:42:14,738 --> 00:42:17,698
I'll take it up with my husband
the moment he dries out.

478
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:20,534
Just remember, Mrs. Farmer,
when you buy a house...

479
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:25,122
...what's in the ground belongs to you,
whether it's gold or oil...

480
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,249
...or Claude Musselman.

481
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:46,476
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

482
00:42:47,603 --> 00:42:49,896
Then take a look at this.

483
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:03,659
Four thousand dollars?

484
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:06,036
It's itemized.

485
00:43:07,414 --> 00:43:13,168
"One satin-lined casket, $2525?

486
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:19,006
One Italian marble headstone, $1,200?

487
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,135
Reverend Cobb's sermon, one...

488
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:24,762
Traffic control"?

489
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:28,307
What? What?

490
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:33,187
So such for getting out
and making friends.

491
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:37,900
Hey, wait. Stop, go back.

492
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:39,652
Go back.

493
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,993
If I can't make a friend,
I'll goddamn buy one.

494
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,433
We're home, boy. Out you go.

495
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,028
Hey, hey. Get away from those ducks.

496
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,283
Hell of a dog.

497
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,371
It sure likes to run.

498
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:41,586
Yo! Hey!

499
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,379
Dog!

500
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,299
Hey! Hey!

501
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:50,511
Come back! Dog!

502
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:55,724
Come on! Come!

503
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:57,893
Ah!

504
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:03,482
Stay here.

505
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,485
Maybe our homeowner's policy
will cover it.

506
00:45:51,237 --> 00:45:55,281
- Well?
- Vanished without a trace.

507
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:59,243
I must have covered 10 square miles.

508
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:02,288
This has been one hell of a day.

509
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:05,291
And it isn't over yet.

510
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:09,253
They installed the kitchen phone
while we were gone.

511
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:13,132
Well, thank God
something's gone right today.

512
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:16,467
Does it work?

513
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:19,971
- I don't know. I didn't try it.
- Why not?

514
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:25,643
I didn't have any change.

515
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:43,535
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yeah.

516
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:46,455
- You?
- Yeah.

517
00:46:46,664 --> 00:46:49,750
- You wanna horse around?
- Yeah.

518
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,293
Hey.

519
00:47:39,048 --> 00:47:41,216
Hey! Dog!

520
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:12,078
I'm not giving up!

521
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:15,540
You're not dealing
with some ignorant hick here!

522
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:43,358
Heading south for the winter, eh?

523
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,627
Welcome back, fellas.

524
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:07,006
Oh, hold on one second.

525
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:18,433
Are you there? Okay.

526
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,205
You look beautiful.

527
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:43,749
Happy anniversary.

528
00:49:45,543 --> 00:49:48,087
Ready for a big night on the town?

529
00:49:48,254 --> 00:49:50,672
But before we go,
I have something for you.

530
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,842
So do I. It's right here.

531
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,260
But I'm saving it for later.

532
00:49:57,096 --> 00:50:00,473
Mine's on the porch. You can have it now.
Close your eyes.

533
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:03,810
Close your eyes.

534
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,604
No peeking.

535
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:18,949
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

536
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,039
Is it alive?

537
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,378
This one's guaranteed not to run away.

538
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:33,630
What's his name?

539
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:35,382
That's up to you.

540
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,051
Hello, Yellow Dog.

541
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:42,346
He's beautiful. I love him. Thank you.

542
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:45,224
We could plant corn back there.
There's plenty of room.

543
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:48,018
Or pumpkins.
Pumpkins would be great.

544
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:51,605
More lamb fries.
Eat them while they're hot.

545
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:54,233
Andy, that's your third order.

546
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:58,571
I am hooked, Elizabeth.
Call me Mr. Lamb Fries.

547
00:50:58,738 --> 00:51:02,073
Now there's a man who knows when
he's got something good in his mouth.

548
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:06,953
You polish off that plate
and you'll break the record, 28.

549
00:51:07,121 --> 00:51:09,080
That one makes 26.

550
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,792
Stand back, everybody.
The record falls tonight.

551
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,210
Look at him go.

552
00:51:14,378 --> 00:51:17,422
I believe he's right.
I believe that record will fall tonight.

553
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,967
- Twenty-seven.
- It's stood at 28 for nearly two years now.

554
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:24,219
That long? Go for it, Andrew.

555
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:26,722
- Twenty-eight.
- That's a tie.

556
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:36,231
Twenty-nine!

557
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:38,525
The new record!

558
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,612
And he's still going.

559
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:44,740
I thought that record
was gonna last forever.

560
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,035
Most folks just don't seem to have
a taste for testicles no more.

561
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:52,121
Testicles?
- Yes, ma'am. Sheep balls.

562
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,791
That's right.
- Tell him why yours is so tasty.

563
00:51:55,959 --> 00:52:00,213
Well, the trick is you've got to
clip them off way up high.

564
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:08,094
Uh-oh. Looks like we got trouble here.

565
00:52:08,804 --> 00:52:12,265
I knew you should've explained
these things better in the menu.

566
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,100
Don't be strangers now, you hear?

567
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:27,948
What is this?

568
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:32,076
Oh, just part of your anniversary present.

569
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:37,498
I thought we could use
a night away from home.

570
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,291
I didn't pack anything.

571
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,377
I thought of that.

572
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:49,009
You devil.

573
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,222
- Are you sure you're feeling better now?
- Oh, fine. I feel great.

574
00:53:04,024 --> 00:53:06,776
This is so romantic.

575
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:20,914
Why don't you make a fire?

576
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:23,041
First...

577
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,630
...open this.

578
00:53:31,259 --> 00:53:33,010
Go ahead, open it.

579
00:53:56,325 --> 00:54:00,076
It's my novel, Elizabeth. The Big Heist.

580
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:03,246
The first few chapters, anyway.

581
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,915
Oh, Andy.

582
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:09,419
That manuscript is the whole reason
we moved to the country.

583
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:11,755
It's good? You really think it's good?

584
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:14,883
Well, read it and tell me.

585
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:19,428
Now? Tonight?

586
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,139
Yes, of course.

587
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:25,059
What, with you watching me?

588
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:28,103
Well, I'll make a fire and you read.

589
00:54:32,942 --> 00:54:33,942
Honey.

590
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,695
Go ahead. Read. Read.

591
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:20,487
You're not laughing.

592
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,532
You didn't find that funny?

593
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:26,659
- What, you mean the first page?
- Yeah.

594
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:29,787
There are at least three big laughs
on that page alone.

595
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:31,497
Look at this guy's name.

596
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:38,379
- Andy.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

597
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,714
Read the next page. It gets funnier.

598
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:42,716
Is this a comedy?

599
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,761
I thought it was, you know,
action-adventure.

600
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,221
It is. It's all three.

601
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:51,099
Read. It's great. Read.

602
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:10,451
Andy, honey, let me read this at home.
I can't... I can't even...

603
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:13,704
I'm sorry. I know.
You can't read while I'm here.

604
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,498
- I'll tell you what.
- Where are you going?

605
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,712
Well, I saw a liquor store on the corner.
I'll buy some champagne, we can celebrate.

606
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,174
- But...
- You just stay here and read.

607
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:27,885
I love you.

608
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:29,443
Wait. Wait, don't tell me yet.

609
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:03,976
Okay, I'm ready. What'd you think?

610
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:20,325
I guess that means you don't like it.

611
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,413
You think it's lousy?

612
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,667
The whole thing?

613
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:34,338
It's all those flashbacks. You never know
when anything is taking place.

614
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:38,551
In the first 20 pages alone, I counted
three flashbacks, one flash-forward...

615
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,846
...and I think on Page 8
you have a flash-sideways.

616
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,265
Well, what about the story?

617
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:48,476
The story?

618
00:58:49,312 --> 00:58:52,355
Yeah. Four poker buddies
knocking over a casino.

619
00:58:52,523 --> 00:58:54,816
The perfect crime.

620
00:58:57,028 --> 00:59:00,614
What are you saying I should do? Take out
the flashbacks? Rewrite the opening?

621
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,532
I could do that.

622
00:59:04,118 --> 00:59:05,659
Then what?

623
00:59:05,827 --> 00:59:07,161
Burn it.

624
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,373
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

625
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:12,875
Thanks.

626
00:59:13,043 --> 00:59:17,129
You don't know a damn thing about writing.
You're a schoolteacher, not an editor.

627
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:19,882
That's obvious. I read the whole thing.

628
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,218
An editor would have stopped reading
after the first paragraph.

629
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:28,181
Okay. You want me to burn it? Is that
what you want? You want me to burn it?

630
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:31,517
There. I hope you're happy, Mrs. Critic!

631
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:33,061
It's burning now, okay?

632
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:35,063
It's burning!

633
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,731
Shit!

634
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh, goddamn it.

635
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:53,330
I'm sorry about the way
I behaved last night.

636
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:57,000
You were just being honest.

637
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:02,798
And it's encouraged me to try harder
and do better. For that, I thank you.

638
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:05,592
Oh, Andy.

639
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:16,936
Think we should put this back?

640
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:21,148
What, are you nuts? This sign is mint.
There's not a bullet hole in it.

641
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:49,968
Andy. Andy, honey.

642
01:00:57,642 --> 01:01:00,310
Save your strength, sweetheart.
I'll get the mail.

643
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:29,672
You want anything else?
How about some apple pie?

644
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,135
No, thanks. I'm just gonna sit here
by the fire and relax.

645
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:36,804
Well, can I bring you
a cup of coffee, then?

646
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:41,641
All right. Good.

647
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:08,042
Here we go.

648
01:02:09,044 --> 01:02:11,212
Hot. Hot.

649
01:02:13,006 --> 01:02:14,924
Here, honey.

650
01:02:15,884 --> 01:02:17,718
Thank you.

651
01:02:22,015 --> 01:02:23,306
I have good news, Andy.

652
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:26,893
You do? Well, let's hear it.
I'm always in the mood for good news.

653
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:30,897
Look.

654
01:02:32,858 --> 01:02:34,943
A check for $5,000 made out to you?

655
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,570
Isn't it wonderful? I sold a book.

656
01:02:38,364 --> 01:02:39,405
What book?

657
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,741
A book I wrote.

658
01:02:42,576 --> 01:02:45,285
Five thousand,
is that much for a first book?

659
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,246
When did you write a book?

660
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:52,125
Well, at odd times. You know,
a little bit here, a little bit there.

661
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:54,253
I wrote it out longhand on legal pads.

662
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,673
Then I Federal Expressed it to an address
I found in your magazine.

663
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,926
And then today when I collected the mail,
there was an envelope...

664
01:03:01,094 --> 01:03:03,428
...and in it was a contract, a check...

665
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:07,431
...and a typed version of my manuscript.

666
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,395
- I can hardly believe it.
- Me too.

667
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:15,273
The publisher wants to know
if I have any others.

668
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,526
- You wrote a book and then you sold it?
- Yeah.

669
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,612
- Well, what's it about?
- Animals.

670
01:03:21,947 --> 01:03:24,866
- Squirrels, mostly.
- Squirrels?

671
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:28,286
- What kind of book is that?
- A children's book.

672
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:31,955
A children's book? Oh, a children's book.

673
01:03:32,331 --> 01:03:34,082
What did you think I wrote, a novel?

674
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,377
I didn't know. That's wonderful.
Congratulations.

675
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:40,881
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm so proud of you. That's wonderful.

676
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:43,925
- Are you, honey? Are you really?
- Of course.

677
01:03:44,093 --> 01:03:48,179
Because I thought you might feel
a little bit jealous or threatened.

678
01:03:48,347 --> 01:03:50,724
Me? Are you kidding?

679
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:54,393
So tell me, these squirrels,
do they have adventures?

680
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:56,270
Oh, yeah. It's so great.

681
01:03:56,438 --> 01:04:00,149
It's about a squirrel from Central Park
who falls asleep in a delivery truck...

682
01:04:00,317 --> 01:04:02,985
...and wakes up in the country.

683
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:07,323
He has some funny misadventures
and he makes all kinds of mistakes...

684
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:10,284
...because he's from the city, right...

685
01:04:10,452 --> 01:04:13,078
...and now he's completely
out of his element.

686
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:17,165
It's a fish-out-of-water story.

687
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:21,210
This squirrel is me, isn't it?

688
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,422
No. No, I wouldn't say that.

689
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:26,674
What's his name?

690
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:29,844
Andy.

691
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:32,847
I'm a son of a bitch.

692
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:36,850
No, honey. Please don't be upset.
It's really very flattering.

693
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:41,063
You were my inspiration.
This is a tribute to you.

694
01:04:42,398 --> 01:04:44,942
- I'd like to read it.
- And you shall.

695
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:46,860
You shall.

696
01:04:47,528 --> 01:04:49,154
Oh, and one more thing.

697
01:04:50,406 --> 01:04:53,909
Would you mind, Andy, if I used
the typewriter for a little bit tonight?

698
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:59,038
I have some ideas for a second story I wanna
get down before they fly out of my head.

699
01:04:59,206 --> 01:05:00,790
Oh, sure.

700
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:04,585
It'll go much faster on the typewriter.
That is, if you don't mind, of course.

701
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:06,504
Okay, let me straighten up a little.

702
01:05:21,227 --> 01:05:24,896
You know, I'm starting to enjoy the idea
of both of us being writers.

703
01:05:25,523 --> 01:05:27,732
It's in the great tradition of...

704
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:30,527
...what's-his-name and his wife.

705
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:37,909
Where'd you get that?

706
01:05:38,077 --> 01:05:39,577
Mrs. Dinges' antique shop.

707
01:05:39,745 --> 01:05:42,955
He's what gave me the idea
to write the book in the first place.

708
01:05:43,123 --> 01:05:45,207
I thought I was your inspiration.

709
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:48,127
It was the combination of the two.

710
01:05:48,294 --> 01:05:50,963
What I did, Andy,
was use the entire town.

711
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:54,091
There's a great big old hedgehog
based on Sheriff Ledbetter.

712
01:05:54,259 --> 01:05:57,344
There's two crazy raccoons that remind me
of those Criterion brothers.

713
01:05:57,512 --> 01:05:59,096
Ooh! Remember that strange man...?

714
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:02,725
But the squirrel, Andy,
he's the main character, isn't he?

715
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:05,601
Well, yes, of course.

716
01:06:07,604 --> 01:06:12,567
So, what kind of cute things will old
Andy the squirrel be up to in the next book?

717
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,779
- Maybe you should read the manuscript first.
- I will, I will.

718
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:19,615
I was just wondering
what's in store for Andy next.

719
01:06:19,783 --> 01:06:22,535
Well, actually, he doesn't make it
into the second book.

720
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:25,203
Why not?

721
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:28,540
He gets run over by a truck
at the end of the first book.

722
01:07:45,698 --> 01:07:48,617
Do you have any idea what time it is?

723
01:08:05,425 --> 01:08:07,718
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

724
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:16,017
All right. All right. Okay.

725
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:20,063
Shovel it.

726
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:29,865
Let's see Memorial Cemetery bill me now.

727
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:39,874
Thanks, fellas.

728
01:08:41,293 --> 01:08:43,586
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, Andy.

729
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:45,337
Thanks, boss.

730
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,798
Come on, come on.

731
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,203
It's 1:00 in the afternoon, Andy.

732
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,332
I'm taking the truck into town.
I need some supplies.

733
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:26,293
And I wanna drop in on Mrs. Dinges.

734
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:31,548
What's going on, Andy?

735
01:09:31,716 --> 01:09:33,634
Is this what you wanna do with your life?

736
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:37,846
Sleep all day long and hang out
with the Criterion brothers?

737
01:09:40,058 --> 01:09:43,143
You're sinking into a pit of self-pity,
defeatism and alcohol...

738
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,269
...and you're enjoying it.

739
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:50,233
You'll see me when you see me.

740
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:28,519
Come on. Come on.

741
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:31,272
Come on.

742
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,776
Shit.

743
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,494
What the hell do you think you're doing?

744
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:49,081
Are you nuts?
What were you honking at?

745
01:10:49,373 --> 01:10:52,375
- Are you Mr. Farmer? Mr. Andy Farmer?
- What?

746
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:53,835
Yes, I am. Why?

747
01:10:54,003 --> 01:10:56,754
We've been trying to contact you
for some time, Mr. Farmer.

748
01:10:56,922 --> 01:10:58,339
My name is Michael Sinclair.

749
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:01,759
Wait. Shut up a minute. Listen.

750
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:03,803
Shit. Give me a hand with this.

751
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:10,143
Come on! Get over here and push. Now!

752
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,316
May I ask what the point of this is?

753
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:19,901
Just keep pushing. You'll see.

754
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:26,199
- Hurry up, he's coming.
- Yes.

755
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,160
Who? Who's coming?

756
01:11:28,328 --> 01:11:29,911
Okay, this is good.

757
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,331
- Hold it steady till I say.
- I don't think I can hold it much longer.

758
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,250
Sure you can. Sure you can.

759
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:38,377
- You're doing just fine.
- Mr. Farmer.

760
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,588
May I know what we're doing?

761
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,007
- When I give you the signal, let it go.
- But Mr. Farmer...

762
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:44,925
Shh! Quiet.

763
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:48,721
- Now! Let it go.
- I can't.

764
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:52,516
- Now, goddamn it!
- I can't! I can't! I can't!

765
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,648
Shit!

766
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,988
We could have nailed him.

767
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,865
We could have had him dead center.

768
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,457
- Who are you anyway?
- I told you who I was.

769
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,209
I'm Michael Sinclair.

770
01:12:21,419 --> 01:12:23,712
From Hufnagel and...

771
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,341
...Brown. Your publisher, Mr. Farmer.

772
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,969
- What are you doing here?
- Your deadline, the first installment.

773
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:34,598
- Deadline?
- Three weeks ago, actually.

774
01:12:34,766 --> 01:12:38,519
We didn't hear from you.
Mr. Farmer, our letters went unanswered.

775
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:43,815
Look, I know all of this must seem crazy,
but you'll just have to trust me on this.

776
01:12:43,982 --> 01:12:47,485
There's absolutely nothing
out of the ordinary happening here.

777
01:12:47,653 --> 01:12:49,153
Yes.

778
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:55,118
Sorry about your car.

779
01:12:55,994 --> 01:12:57,286
A rental?

780
01:12:57,454 --> 01:12:59,497
I just bought it.

781
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:01,581
Let's just forget about the deadline.

782
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:05,168
Return the advance money
and we'll call it even.

783
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:08,755
What, give the money back?
I've been working.

784
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:12,008
I've got stuff down on paper,
right in my house.

785
01:13:12,176 --> 01:13:15,095
Come up and look at it. It's great stuff.

786
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:47,876
Here, take this.

787
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:52,172
It's not the novel, but it shows
I've been working. I think you'll like it.

788
01:13:52,339 --> 01:13:53,715
Please take it.

789
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,634
You'll be hearing from us, Mr. Farmer.
Good day.

790
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:24,620
Hello?

791
01:14:24,787 --> 01:14:27,998
- Hello? Farmer residence?
- Yes.

792
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:30,958
Well, I finally made it.

793
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:33,920
Getting through to Redbud is
no easy business.

794
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:35,755
Is Mr. Farmer there?

795
01:14:35,923 --> 01:14:37,965
No, he's...

796
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:42,720
Well, he's still sleeping actually.
This is his wife. Can I help you?

797
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:45,598
This is Michael Sinclair, Mrs. Farmer...

798
01:14:45,766 --> 01:14:47,683
...from Hufnagel and Brown...

799
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:51,270
...your husband's publishing house.
- Oh, yes.

800
01:14:51,437 --> 01:14:54,606
Would you mind passing along
to your husband my apologies?

801
01:14:54,774 --> 01:14:57,442
I've been dealing with writers
for 15 years.

802
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:02,113
You'd think I'd be used to
their eccentricities by now.

803
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:05,450
Anyway, I acted like a fool
and I apologize.

804
01:15:05,785 --> 01:15:08,036
Your husband's a very talented man.

805
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,663
Thank you.

806
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,081
But how did you know?

807
01:15:11,249 --> 01:15:13,791
Believe me, Mrs. Farmer, I know.

808
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:16,043
I have in front of me a manuscript...

809
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,712
...that is simply wondefrul.

810
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,423
- It's fresh, it's original.
- You like it?

811
01:15:21,591 --> 01:15:24,385
We love it. And we want to put it out.

812
01:15:24,886 --> 01:15:27,179
Andy will be thrilled.

813
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,849
We don't actually publish children's books
here at Hufnagel.

814
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:33,310
- But we have a subsidiary...
- Wait a minute.

815
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:36,312
- Did you say "children's book"?
- Yes.

816
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,400
Didn't he submit a book about
four poker buddies knocking over a casino?

817
01:15:41,068 --> 01:15:43,194
A casino?

818
01:15:43,362 --> 01:15:46,906
No. No, this book is about squirrels.

819
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,994
Mrs. Farmer?

820
01:15:51,287 --> 01:15:53,162
Mrs. Farmer, are you there?

821
01:15:54,415 --> 01:15:55,957
Hello?

822
01:16:11,556 --> 01:16:14,266
- What's up?
- What's it look like?

823
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:15,934
I'm leaving.

824
01:16:16,102 --> 01:16:17,561
And I want a divorce.

825
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:20,896
- What's wrong?
- How could you?

826
01:16:21,356 --> 01:16:25,568
Have you no shame?
Have you actually sunk this low?

827
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:28,195
What are you talking about?

828
01:16:28,363 --> 01:16:31,532
Your publisher just called.
He just loves the book you gave him.

829
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,618
My book!

830
01:16:33,785 --> 01:16:37,121
What, were you drunk again?
Or just desperate?

831
01:16:38,915 --> 01:16:43,043
How could you do something
so pathetic and underhanded?

832
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,878
Underhanded?

833
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:47,297
What do you call writing a book
behind my back...

834
01:16:47,465 --> 01:16:49,591
...all the while telling me mine stinks?

835
01:16:49,925 --> 01:16:52,218
Talk about underhanded.
What about that?

836
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:57,098
You're not taking the typewriter.

837
01:16:57,391 --> 01:17:01,102
I don't want your typewriter, Andy.
You keep it.

838
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:04,438
Maybe you'll find a use for it someday.

839
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:06,899
What about the apple?

840
01:17:07,525 --> 01:17:09,401
What apple?

841
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:11,111
"What apple?"

842
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:13,614
You know very well what apple.
The last apple.

843
01:17:13,782 --> 01:17:18,369
The one you ate when we were practically
starving. After you ate the last banana!

844
01:17:19,412 --> 01:17:20,579
Are you serious?

845
01:17:20,747 --> 01:17:23,415
Don't try to deny it.
I stepped on the core!

846
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,792
Don't worry.

847
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:30,338
I'm willing to concede that our marriage
has been just a series of mutual betrayals.

848
01:17:30,506 --> 01:17:33,883
I know it, you know it,
and Yellow Dog knows it!

849
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:37,011
Yellow Dog doesn't even know
what town he lives in!

850
01:17:37,179 --> 01:17:39,931
I'm taking this truck
and I'm moving in with Mrs. Dinges!

851
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:41,557
Good!

852
01:17:44,436 --> 01:17:46,104
Out!

853
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:48,105
Scram! Beat it!

854
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:00,909
Don't forget your pal, Andy!

855
01:18:14,047 --> 01:18:15,506
All right, then.

856
01:18:15,674 --> 01:18:20,761
We've come together in the matter
of Farmer v. Farmer.

857
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,056
Mrs. Farmer, you're beginning
divorce proceedings...

858
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:28,060
...against your husband, correct?
- Who wants the house?

859
01:18:28,228 --> 01:18:29,645
- I don't.
- Not me.

860
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,398
Well, at least you're both
in agreement on something.

861
01:18:33,566 --> 01:18:36,276
Marion, when's the next
available court date?

862
01:18:36,444 --> 01:18:40,572
- We have to go to court?
We are merely attorneys, Mrs. Farmer...

863
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:45,034
...handmaidens of the law.
Only a judge can dissolve a marriage.

864
01:18:45,202 --> 01:18:47,078
A circuit judge will be here
next month...

865
01:18:47,246 --> 01:18:50,498
...but that's when we go to trial
on your personal injury, it seems.

866
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:53,667
Wait a minute. You represent him
in another matter?

867
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:55,252
Yes, sir.

868
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,505
- Isn't that a conflict of interest?
- Not in my book.

869
01:18:58,673 --> 01:19:01,800
Okay. How about
the first week in February?

870
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:04,303
July would be better for me.

871
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:06,764
July is seven months away.

872
01:19:07,724 --> 01:19:10,517
- Were you in a rush?
- Excuse us just a minute.

873
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:17,064
You gotta get this ceiling
painted sometime, Marion.

874
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:23,446
Move to carry. The town of Redbud
will seek official accreditation...

875
01:19:23,614 --> 01:19:26,073
...as the acorn capital of the world.

876
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:30,286
Last on the agenda, Elizabeth and
Andy Farmer have requested permission...

877
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:32,455
...to address the council.

878
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:35,917
As the current lamb-fry record holder...

879
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:39,211
...I'm sure Mr. Farmer
is familiar to you all.

880
01:19:50,556 --> 01:19:53,058
- Why don't you sit down?
- Cut it out.

881
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:57,562
Thank you, Mayor Barclay,
members of the council.

882
01:19:59,273 --> 01:20:01,607
Citizens of Redbud.

883
01:20:03,568 --> 01:20:05,027
We came to Redbud...

884
01:20:05,195 --> 01:20:08,948
...filled with hopes and dreams
for a better life and a better place.

885
01:20:09,115 --> 01:20:12,076
And basically, we've seen
those hopes and dreams...

886
01:20:12,244 --> 01:20:15,246
...shattered and crushed
before our very eyes.

887
01:20:16,248 --> 01:20:21,293
Now, I'm not saying it's entirely your fault.
We're as much to blame for this as you.

888
01:20:21,627 --> 01:20:23,169
Well, maybe more like 60-40...

889
01:20:23,337 --> 01:20:26,047
...but we didn't come down here
to quibble over percentages.

890
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:28,299
- What did you come here for?
- Sit down.

891
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:31,719
We came here to ask your help
in selling our house.

892
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,600
There's money in this for you.

893
01:20:40,104 --> 01:20:43,022
Sit down. We can at least listen.

894
01:20:49,737 --> 01:20:51,154
Sit down.

895
01:20:51,322 --> 01:20:53,365
Thank you very much.

896
01:20:54,242 --> 01:20:56,660
My wife, Elizabeth.

897
01:21:01,332 --> 01:21:05,419
These are Saturday Evening Post
magazines from the '30s and the '40s.

898
01:21:05,586 --> 01:21:10,464
The covers of these magazines were
painted by a man named Norman Rockwell.

899
01:21:12,593 --> 01:21:15,636
Norman Rockwell knew a thing or two
about small-town life.

900
01:21:16,013 --> 01:21:18,806
Normal small-town life.

901
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:24,145
He knew how people looked,
what they did, how they dressed.

902
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:26,188
And that's what we want from you.

903
01:21:26,356 --> 01:21:29,232
We want you to look and dress and act...

904
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,236
...just like the people
on the covers of these magazines.

905
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:35,488
So...

906
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,783
Pass them out amongst yourselves.

907
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:42,245
Look at them. Study them.

908
01:21:42,413 --> 01:21:43,872
Take them home, if you wish.

909
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,500
But be careful, they're on loan
from Mrs. Dinges' antique shop.

910
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:52,254
Hold on, now, Mrs. Farmer.
Did we hear some mention of money?

911
01:21:52,422 --> 01:21:55,674
Within 24 hours of the close of escrow
on our property...

912
01:21:55,842 --> 01:22:01,972
...we will present to the town of Redbud
a check in the amount of $15,000.

913
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:07,853
Also, a bonus of $50 each...

914
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:09,813
...to any individual who performs...

915
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:13,733
...a specific act of
traditional small-town behavior...

916
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:16,235
...in the presence
of the prospective buyers.

917
01:22:20,282 --> 01:22:25,161
Leave it to me, Andy and Elizabeth.
I'll ram this project home.

918
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:32,210
Now, how much notice do you think
you'll need to start acting normal?

919
01:22:49,227 --> 01:22:50,811
Here they come.

920
01:23:14,251 --> 01:23:16,919
They're going around front. Good.

921
01:23:28,764 --> 01:23:31,057
Oh, Bud.

922
01:23:31,225 --> 01:23:35,687
It's perfect.
It's just what we're looking for.

923
01:23:37,356 --> 01:23:40,107
Oh, look, honey, ducks.

924
01:23:45,363 --> 01:23:48,032
- Cue the deer.
- Roger.

925
01:23:51,953 --> 01:23:54,079
Oh, look.

926
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,293
- Great.
- Play it cool, honey.

927
01:23:59,461 --> 01:24:03,046
- Let's not let them think we're too eager.
- Yes, yes.

928
01:24:03,213 --> 01:24:04,547
Go.

929
01:24:07,843 --> 01:24:09,343
How do I look?

930
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:13,473
The pipe's a bit much.

931
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,783
- Yes?
- Hi, the Culbertsons, Bud and Betsy.

932
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:35,619
- Oh, yeah. Please come in.
- Thank you.

933
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:38,538
Darling, the Culbertsons are here.

934
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,586
Didn't expect you so soon.
Andrew Farmer. Excuse the mess.

935
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:46,587
Don't you have a dog?

936
01:24:47,506 --> 01:24:49,090
You bet.

937
01:24:49,299 --> 01:24:52,176
He's probably out somewhere
scaring up game.

938
01:24:53,095 --> 01:24:57,014
It's been a dream of ours for a long time,
moving out to the country.

939
01:24:57,432 --> 01:24:59,016
Bud's going to write a novel.

940
01:25:01,478 --> 01:25:03,062
How nice.

941
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:06,023
Excuse me.

942
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,775
This is a wonderful house to write in.

943
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:12,237
Do you mind if I ask why you're moving?

944
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,533
Well, actually we're being transferred.

945
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,159
Andy's with the government.

946
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:20,286
High-level position.

947
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:23,123
It's all classified.

948
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,208
You know how it is.
They never tell the wives...

949
01:25:52,985 --> 01:25:55,736
Mail, Mr. Farmer.

950
01:25:56,196 --> 01:26:00,199
I'll just put it right over here
on the table for you, sir.

951
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:02,618
As usual, I weeded out...

952
01:26:02,786 --> 01:26:04,954
...all of the junk mail myself.

953
01:26:05,122 --> 01:26:09,333
Mrs. Farmer, Mrs. Petree asked me
to bring this over to you.

954
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:14,087
It's her traditional rum-nut-plum-raisin
cake of the season.

955
01:26:14,255 --> 01:26:15,922
Thank you.

956
01:26:17,383 --> 01:26:20,218
May I present Mr. and Mrs. Culbertson?

957
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:24,639
- Bud and Betsy.
- They're thinking of buying the house.

958
01:26:24,807 --> 01:26:27,517
Oh, is that so? Well, you won't regret it.

959
01:26:27,977 --> 01:26:32,981
But I'm really gonna be sorry
to see the Farmers go.

960
01:26:38,445 --> 01:26:41,197
Well, I'd better be going.

961
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:46,535
Doing some ice fishing tonight. Pulling
some nice size pike out of the lake, I hear.

962
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:48,662
Good day to you folks.

963
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:57,296
Ice fishing?

964
01:26:57,464 --> 01:27:00,131
I thought it was a nice touch.

965
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:02,759
But it'll cost you.

966
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:49,679
This is gonna cost us a fortune.

967
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:53,349
The $50 bonus was your idea.

968
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:55,101
Little piece of heaven, isn't it, Bud?

969
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:58,729
- Very nice. Very nice.
Happy holidays.

970
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:01,440
Season's greetings.
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho.

971
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:03,984
Season's greetings, folks.
Merry Christmas.

972
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:08,238
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho.

973
01:28:08,406 --> 01:28:11,783
Merry Christmas. Andy.

974
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:20,709
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

975
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:24,879
Merry Christmas, folks. Merry Christmas.

976
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:26,714
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello, sheriff.

977
01:28:26,881 --> 01:28:28,549
Is everything going well in Redbud?

978
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:30,634
I was just about to take a run
to your place.

979
01:28:30,802 --> 01:28:32,845
You patrol the homes outside of town?

980
01:28:33,013 --> 01:28:34,972
Absolutely. Twice a day.

981
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,891
Check for any suspicious vehicles
or persons in the area.

982
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:40,644
If the owner is on vacation,
I try the locks.

983
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:42,396
Pick up all the newspapers.

984
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:46,317
- Redbud may be a small town...
- Well, keep up the good work, sheriff.

985
01:28:46,609 --> 01:28:48,735
Ivy's is open. Hungry, Bud?

986
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:51,279
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sheriff.

987
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:53,573
Merry Christmas.

988
01:28:54,074 --> 01:28:56,326
Watch it.
Move out of the way!

989
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:05,626
Watch your step.

990
01:29:08,422 --> 01:29:11,673
Merry Christmas.

991
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:13,425
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

992
01:29:13,593 --> 01:29:15,052
Merry Christmas.

993
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,723
Hey, Mom, this is fun!

994
01:29:42,913 --> 01:29:44,622
Thank you.

995
01:30:02,681 --> 01:30:06,518
That was just beautiful. Why don't you all
come inside for some hot cocoa and eggnog?

996
01:30:37,006 --> 01:30:39,632
A toast to the Farmers.
We'll miss you or my name isn't...

997
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,136
...Otis Berryhill, 23 Redbud Road.
- To the Farmers!

998
01:30:43,303 --> 01:30:44,762
Thank you.

999
01:30:46,348 --> 01:30:49,434
I would like to propose a toast too,
if I may.

1000
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:52,478
I may not be a sentimental man...

1001
01:30:52,646 --> 01:30:55,231
...but there is something
I would like to say at this time.

1002
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:58,818
It's very hard for Elizabeth and me
to say farewell.

1003
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:02,863
There will always be a special place
for Redbud in our hearts.

1004
01:31:05,366 --> 01:31:10,078
And I know that you will show
the new owners, whoever they may be...

1005
01:31:11,622 --> 01:31:13,957
...the same affection
that you've shown us.

1006
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:18,920
And that they too will grow to love
this town and this house...

1007
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:23,883
...and all of you wonderful people
just as much as we have.

1008
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:25,217
My friends...

1009
01:31:26,845 --> 01:31:27,887
...as the saying goes:

1010
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:30,723
Once a Redbudian...

1011
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:33,809
Always a Redbudian.

1012
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,520
And so, my friends, a toast.

1013
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,274
- To Redbud.
To Redbud.

1014
01:31:40,442 --> 01:31:44,652
Well, back to work. Thanks, Andy.
- Goodbye, Otis.

1015
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:48,364
Merry Christmas.

1016
01:31:48,532 --> 01:31:50,450
- Warren Smith.
- Warren Smith.

1017
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,161
- Bob Connor.
- Bob Connor.

1018
01:31:53,412 --> 01:31:55,497
- Connie Caliber.
- Connie Caliber.

1019
01:31:55,664 --> 01:31:56,915
Bill Benden.

1020
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:04,047
No, no. No, no, no.

1021
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:06,340
Get out of here.

1022
01:32:06,591 --> 01:32:08,383
Merry Christmas.

1023
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,220
- Doris Newbury.
- Doris, hi.

1024
01:32:11,429 --> 01:32:15,474
- Elizabeth Garfield.
- Elizabeth Garfield.

1025
01:32:16,809 --> 01:32:18,435
Andy.

1026
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,105
Betsy and I wanna sleep on it...

1027
01:32:22,273 --> 01:32:26,026
...but I think we'll be back in the morning
to make you an offer on the house.

1028
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:29,695
What, tomorrow?
Well, where are you staying tonight?

1029
01:32:29,863 --> 01:32:31,864
Sid's Hideaway Bungalows.

1030
01:32:32,032 --> 01:32:33,991
No, no, stay away from town.
Stay with us.

1031
01:32:34,493 --> 01:32:38,329
- Stay in our guest room.
Well, that's awful nice of you, Andy.

1032
01:32:38,497 --> 01:32:40,748
It's no problem at all. Happy to do it.

1033
01:32:44,211 --> 01:32:46,587
Okay, let's get our bags.

1034
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:46,728
I love the sound of Christmas carolers.

1035
01:33:46,895 --> 01:33:48,229
Yeah.

1036
01:33:49,148 --> 01:33:51,399
They've been at it for hours.

1037
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:00,532
You can have the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

1038
01:34:01,534 --> 01:34:03,619
I'm sorry about this.

1039
01:34:03,786 --> 01:34:05,871
It's only for one night.

1040
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:10,459
You did it, Andy.

1041
01:34:10,627 --> 01:34:13,045
You really pulled it off.

1042
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:15,714
Of course I did, Elizabeth.

1043
01:34:16,799 --> 01:34:18,966
Being a fake is what I do best.

1044
01:34:43,324 --> 01:34:45,492
That's our offer, Andy.

1045
01:34:57,338 --> 01:35:01,675
- This is more than we're asking.
- We want it all. The furniture...

1046
01:35:01,842 --> 01:35:05,260
...the dishes, the pots and pans.
It's all so perfect.

1047
01:35:05,428 --> 01:35:08,055
- We want everything.
- I even want the dog.

1048
01:35:09,724 --> 01:35:12,976
Yellow Dog? You want Yellow Dog?

1049
01:35:13,186 --> 01:35:16,230
Just initial that offer on the bottom,
Andy, and we'll call it a deal.

1050
01:35:34,206 --> 01:35:37,041
I've done a lot of things
I'm ashamed of lately, Elizabeth.

1051
01:35:38,627 --> 01:35:42,213
Made a lot of mistakes.
I don't wanna make another one.

1052
01:35:48,136 --> 01:35:49,886
I don't wanna move. I like it here.

1053
01:35:53,474 --> 01:35:55,142
I don't wanna move either.

1054
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:57,352
Hey, what is this?

1055
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,397
- And I don't want a divorce.
- Neither do I.

1056
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,442
- You don't?
- Of course not.

1057
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:05,944
I don't know what I was doing.

1058
01:36:06,112 --> 01:36:08,237
You were acting so strange.

1059
01:36:09,698 --> 01:36:11,907
I know I was. I'm sorry.

1060
01:36:12,075 --> 01:36:13,993
So am I.

1061
01:36:14,161 --> 01:36:16,787
Hold it. Wait a minute here.

1062
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:18,497
What the hell is going on?

1063
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,709
What?

1064
01:36:21,877 --> 01:36:24,503
He says the house is no longer for sale.

1065
01:36:25,338 --> 01:36:26,672
Well, he can't do that.

1066
01:36:28,967 --> 01:36:31,801
He says we've decided to stay.

1067
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,054
Come on, Betsy.
Let's get the hell out of here.

1068
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:39,225
- You'll be hearing from my attorney, Farmer.
Fuck you.

1069
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:40,685
He says...

1070
01:36:40,853 --> 01:36:45,940
...you can contact him through
the law offices of Marion Corey, Jr.

1071
01:36:55,116 --> 01:36:56,700
Out of the way.
Get out of the way.

1072
01:36:56,868 --> 01:36:59,286
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

1073
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,876
Shut up!

1074
01:37:26,438 --> 01:37:28,898
Everybody gather around.

1075
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:31,776
Gather around, everybody.

1076
01:37:34,363 --> 01:37:36,321
May I have your attention, please?

1077
01:37:38,491 --> 01:37:39,991
I have an announcement to make.

1078
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:43,370
Sorry, Andy and Elizabeth. We let those two
get away. We'll do better next time.

1079
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:44,913
That doesn't matter anymore.

1080
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:47,040
I have good news.

1081
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,252
We're not leaving.
We've decided to stay.

1082
01:37:51,754 --> 01:37:53,004
What about our money?

1083
01:37:54,257 --> 01:37:56,591
Well, I know that was
part of the original plan...

1084
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,717
...but the circumstances have changed.

1085
01:37:58,885 --> 01:38:00,761
We still get our money, don't we?

1086
01:38:02,138 --> 01:38:04,223
Well, I'm sure that all of you...

1087
01:38:04,391 --> 01:38:07,059
...in the spirit of the joyous
Christmas season...

1088
01:38:07,227 --> 01:38:09,812
...will find it in your hearts...

1089
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,981
Perhaps not.

1090
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:31,791
All right.

1091
01:38:31,959 --> 01:38:34,460
Mayor Barclay ruled we weren't
liable for the 15 grand...

1092
01:38:34,628 --> 01:38:37,130
...since we never actually
sold the house.

1093
01:38:37,298 --> 01:38:39,465
But we decided to make good
on the $50 bonuses...

1094
01:38:39,633 --> 01:38:42,301
...which greatly improved
our relationship with the town.

1095
01:38:43,136 --> 01:38:46,054
Elizabeth, meanwhile,
has had two new books published.

1096
01:38:46,222 --> 01:38:48,891
And I've been working
for the Redbud Gazette.

1097
01:38:49,058 --> 01:38:53,061
As a novelist, I turned out to be
a pretty good sportswriter.

1098
01:38:53,313 --> 01:38:54,813
Before leaving New York...

1099
01:38:54,981 --> 01:38:57,858
...Elizabeth and I thought we knew
exactly what we were getting into.

1100
01:38:58,026 --> 01:39:01,570
Well, we were wrong
about almost everything.

1101
01:39:01,738 --> 01:39:03,739
But one thing we had right.

1102
01:39:03,907 --> 01:39:06,824
Moving to the country was
the best decision we ever made.

1103
01:39:06,992 --> 01:39:10,077
- We're tied.
- All right. Bring it in, bring it in.

1104
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,168
- Safe!
- What?
