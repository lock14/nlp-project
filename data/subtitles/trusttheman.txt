I need help!
- I'll go.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
Dad'll be right back.
Daddy's not leaving, honey. He's just
helping your brother in the bathroom.
It's okay.
Hey, look at that!
What's going on?
I'm trying to poop, but I can't.
Just relax, David.
Don't work so hard.
But my stomach hurts.
I had to burp, but I need to poop.
Well, sometimes if you just sit there,
a fart will just work its way out.
Who said anything about a fart?
HoneyI The Terminix guy is finished.
A fart's just as good as a burp, David,
sometimes even better.
A fart, a burp or a poop.
- What am I talking about?
- Mr. Ronson -
- you have a problem.
- Fantastic.
Here it comes!
I gotta bring these galleys I proofed
into work today.
Shouldn't your boss
be proofin' those?
Yeah, she should, but she's behind
for maternity leave
so I'm covering for her.
So much for taking the job
so you can work on your book.
Anyway, it would be great
if you could drive me.
- Oh, sweetie, I can't. Today is Monday.
- So?
Well, alternate side is in effect,
so I gotta move the car.
- Into another parking spot?
- Yeah.
You're not gonna drive me 'cause you have to
park the car on the other side of the street?
Well, you're oversimplifying it now.
How's that? You only use the car
when you need to drive it 10 feet -
- into a legal parking spot.
- If I'm lucky.
That doesn't make any sense!
Look, if we're not gonna use it,
will you just sell it?
I like knowing it's there.
Booyah! Bam! Bam!
Right. So if there's an emergency,
we always have a way out of Manhattan.
Well, you laugh now,
but that thing is fully equipped.
Tobey, you've got two bottles of water
in there and four PowerBars.
How far is that gonna get us?
The car has special meaning to me.
Can you deal with that?
Why?
Look, if you must know...
the first time I saw you,
I was in that car.
Fine.
I'll take a cab.
- I gotta go.
- All right, baby.
- Later.
- What, are you kiddin'me?
Okay, so it sounds like
everything's goin' good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, there's still
all the same old issues.
What are those?
What are the same old issues?
- Well, you know, like no sex.
- Well, that's your issue.
- I'd say that's our issue.
- No. I'm just not
a sex maniac like you are.
I'm not a maniac.
I just like it.
Twice a day.
What is that look
supposed to mean?
It's not like I'm saying I like to kill
baby squirrels. I like to have sex.
- Always from behind.
- Now, that is a lie.
- That's a lie.
- You know it is not, Tom.
You know, sometimes I would
just like to look at you.
Maybe you'd have more luck if you did
something a little more romantic.
The only way to approach you is from behind
because your back's always turned to me.
I'm reading. I just like to have a minute to
myself without you pawing at me all day.
Well, forgive me
if I want to touch my wife.
Here's what I think.
I think, if I may say...
we could get a lot more work done
if you'd come in more than once a year.
Would you think about it?
- We'll think about it.
- Yeah.
Would you... And, Tom...
listen to Rebecca and don't...
don't paw at her.
And just give her some space, okay?
And Rebecca,
think about having sex with Tom.
Possibly doggy style.
Okay?
And I have your cell numbers, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Therapy always makes me so horny.
Did he actually say "doggy style"?
Yeah. I knew I liked that guy.
- I gotta go.
- Mmm. No.
Tom, I have rehearsal.
Don't suck my face off.
Did I tell you I had a dream last night
that you gave me a blow job?
Yeah. I had a dream
that I gave you a German shepherd.
Unhand me. And remember,
you're picking up David from school...
and we need milk.
I know. It's my new life...
househusband.
Hey, dude.
You asked for it.
Yo, Miss Rollack.
Rebecca. Yo!
Come on, Rebecca.
Just give us a couple of pictures!
- Yeah, you leavin'?
- You wish!
Blow me, dickhead!
Megan Sweetlander's office. Please hold.
Megan Sweetlander's office.
May I help you?
- Hey, it's me.
- Oh, God.
- I'm swamped here.
- Oh, just hang up on them all.
I did it.
Oh, my God.
I was kidding!
- Jesus, that felt good.
- Hey, do you think I'm crazy?
Not compared
to other actresses, no.
How often do you
and my brother have sex?
Satisfying sex or just sex?
- Oh, say no more.
- I try to, but he won't listen.
You know, we have good...
We have good sex.
Sometimes.
- Elaine!
- Um, I really gotta go.
Do you ever worry
that Tobey'll cheat on you?
Only with his therapist.
I'm hanging up.
Uh, unfortunately, we do not accept
unsolicited manuscripts.
- You never have time for me any...
- Thank you.
- Elaine.
- Yes.
"A curveball
is the speed of the air...
moving fast"
Hey.
Hey, I'm just reading your article
on wrist injuries in older pitchers.
That's fascinating stuff.
Yep. I really blew the lid off
carpal tunnel syndrome.
Well, at least you have a job.
When Rebecca asked what I was doing
this morning, I said "the usual."
You think she knew that meant
breakfast, jerk off, nap, late lunch?
Yeah, well, maybe
I shouldn't have quit advertising.
As I remember, you hated it,
felt empty and hollow...
worthless, void of meaning,
purposeless...
Any of this ring a bell?
It might be better than this.
I'm beginning to feel like a kept boy.
- Only I don't know what I'm being kept for.
- Sex?
Sure, if you're up for it.
Rebecca's not.
That's weird.
She slept with everyone in high school.
And even when we do have sex...
it's like
she's not adventurous anymore.
Cottage cheese.
It's like she used her sexual adventurousness
to lure me in, and she's just normal.
She's just normal.
Mommy's just normal!
I guess you hoped it'd be more like
marrying a hooker, huh?
Yeah. Except without
the payment though.
Speaking of that, do you have
another word for fish lover?
Excuse me, sir.
Can we cut in front of you?
We gotta get home for our nap.
We gotta rush.
We're in a rush.
Um... aficionado?
- Do you take milk?
- Oh. I do...
but I like to pour it myself.
Oh, yeah.
I just wanted to say
I think you're awesome...
and I feel incredible...
to be able to, you know...
share the stage with you,
Miss Pollack.
Rebecca.
What was your name again?
Jasper.
- I had a puppy named Jasper.
- Hi.
That's funny,
because my last name is Bernard.
- Like Saint Bernard.
- Right.
Like the dog.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Mmm. Oh!
Careful.
My dear.
- Do you have a moment?
- Oh, yeah.
I know you turned down a film to do this role,
and I do appreciate that.
I do, however,
feel the need to remind you...
that this is a play, not a film...
and it will require some projection.
- It was just a table read.
- No defenses, okay?
Oh, Jasper!
Dad, I can't reach it. Help me.
Oh, you're close.
Reach.
Hey, Mom, I wanna
take home mine too.
Okay. Go ahead.
You know you're breaking the rules.
What do you mean?
That stuff's not supposed to go home
till the end of the year.
Well, David
told me he needed-he needed it.
Yeah? You also give him
chocolate for dinner, right?
What are you,
the room monitor or something?
No. It's refreshing
to see someone breaking the rules.
- You're a rebel.
- Mom, help me!
Okay. Here we go.
I'll help you too, David...
'cause your dad would
leave you standing here all day.
- Wow, you're strong!
- Thank you.
If you tell, I'll say you did it,
and they'll believe me.
Come on.
Come back soon.
Thank you.
So how come only once a year?
Well, you don't want to dissect it too much.
It's like a tune-up.
If you go regularly,
you just become one of those couples...
that disappears
up their own assholes, you know?
As my father used to say.
Thank you for that image
while I'm eating a whole fish.
I don't think fish have assholes.
Boys. No more use of that word
while there's food on the table.
Yeah. They got us.
- How's the play going?
- It's all right.
The director's sort of
a pretentious moron.
- That's a drag.
- Hi, Roberto.
Ciao, Miss Pollack.
- And this has got to be...
- Asshole.
my last carbohydrate-heavy
meal for a very long time.
Are you kidding?
You look great.
How's the book?
I think I'm done.
Wow!
I'm gonna start sending it out to agents.
- Yowsa.
- What?
I don't know what makes me think
I know anything about kids.
- No, it's a terrific idea.
- Oh, my God.
- That's Faith Faison.
- That's Faith Faison?
He already wants to know
when they're making it into a movie.
- She sees you.
- What are you doing?
Sometimes you get...
- Tasting the wine.
- something caught in your mouth.
Tobey!
- Faith, wow!
- My God!
How are you?
Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here!
Geez! Whoa!
Well, no, I always come here. You're not
gonna find better Northern Italian food...
anywhere in the city.
- That's my husband.
- What?
Oh! Well, that's my girlfriend.
Of seven years.
- Oh!
- Elaine.
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Congratulations on getting married.
- Oh, thank you.
Are you guys gonna?
What?
We're married.
And it's overrated.
- What?
- Uh-oh!
- Hi-oh!
- I'd better go.
- So great to see you.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
And I hope you don't mind me saying,
but I love your work.
Thank you very much.
You hate that, don't you?
Bye-bye.
So, who was that chick?
Who?
Tobey!
You are the worst.
What, Faith? I don't know.
Knew her in college.
- She an old girlfriend?
- No.
- She's pretty.
- Yeah. You see her boyfriend?
I mean, do you have to
work out every day?
Did you know, by the way,
that muscle sinks faster in the pool?
He's her husband, actually.
Oh. Seems a little young
for that, doesn't she?
You're the only one who thinks
you have to be 40 to get married.
She probably wanted to do it
before she was completely barren.
Oh! That reminds me.
I taped the, uh, documentary for you...
on the Serengeti.
Tobey! I said Ferlinghetti.
It was for work.
Oh.
Well, hey, come on.
Serengeti's cool. Right?
Yeah. It's great.
See? I'm fun.
Mmm. Who knew
lobster cannelloni was an aphrodisiac?
Is that what this is?
No. It's lobster Ponson.
You pay Maria when we get home
and then meet me in the bedroom.
Like for sex?
Don't ruin it.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- The kids were great.
- The kids love you.
- David drew a big picture of baboon...
- That's great.
and the little girl.
- You get home safe.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I, uh...
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna get a drink.
What the hell? Huh?
Oh!
It was my last night of carbs...
and I wanted
to take advantage of it.
You know, sometimes it's those
near-death experiences...
that make us wanna
participate in life that much more.
I can still kinda
taste the throw up.
Good.
Whoa, whoa! Oh!
Bouncy, bouncy.
Bouncy, bouncy.
Just one more thing,
then we're gonna go home, okay?
- Is that it?
- Let me get one of those.
- This one?
- No, no, no.
Three down from
Sports World and one to the left.
Uh... this one?
No, no. Your other left.
Diag-Diagonal from there.
Shaved?
Ah, good one.
That's 3.15.
Here. Candy for the baby.
- Good man.
- And the candy, one dollar.
No, I-I don't wanna be too hard on him.
It's just that I feel like he's not directed,
and that makes him unhappy.
And the more unhappy he gets,
the more desperate he gets.
And the more desperate he gets,
the less I wanna have sex with him.
Oh. For Tobey,
desperation is foreplay.
You know, I should probably be...
more attentive.
Or at least permissive.
Do you ever wonder
what your life would be like...
if you'd chosen someone different?
Like, okay, I was on the train
the other day.
This guy was sitting across from me.
He was wearing
this big, cozy Vermonty sweater.
Just seemed...
old-fashioned...
like he probably had tons of kids
who climb all over him at bedtime.
They go sledding in the winter.
Pick flowers in the spring.
Kill deer in the fall.
No. I just did not expect to want
to have a baby this soon.
A baby?
Oh, I don't know.
All of a sudden it just...
feels right.
Honey, you're so young, you know?
And Tobey, he's just like a teenager
with a checking account.
Excuse me. These are from
the young man over in the corner.
He wanted you to know
that you are, like... awesome?
- Who is that?
- See ya at rehearsal.
I'll tell ya later.
- That was kinda fun.
- Yeah.
Maybe I should become
a first grade teacher.
Who was that mother
you were talking to?
Who?
Oh, that-that's, uh,
that's Shannon's mom, you know?
She's a divorcйe, right?
I don't think
anybody's used that term...
since, like, 1954.
She's pretty.
I guess.
You know, uh, you do kinda owe me.
- I owe you?
- And I know you're tired.
But I have a way where you don't have to
exert any energy at all.
Do you have to wear your retainer?
If that's one of your tapes,
you can forget it.
Okay.
Here's how it's gonna go down.
I'm gonna close my eyes...
and you have to tell me
everything that's happening on TV.
No way in hell I'm gonna do that.
It's either that or actual sex.
You make the call.
This is erotic for you?
- Okay...
- Oh. No, no, no.
Okay. There's some kind
of a credit sequence happening.
Just, uh-it's very simple.
Black on white titles.
Okay, Scorsese.
Save your breath for the good stuff.
Now there's some people
in the worst set design I have ever seen.
- Come on.
- Okay. Um...
Okay, no, here they go.
Here they go.
- Wow. Um-yeah, pants are off.
- Mm-hmm.
Dress is off. Penis is hard.
They're starting.
A little less like a list, please.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?
This guy's dick is green
and kind of crooked.
It's, like, twice the size of yours!
- Another, um-another woman's coming in.
- Yeah?
- She is Chinese.
- Nice.
- No. No.
- No?
- Uh, Filipino.
- Okay.
She's hiking up her uniform.
And that is a terrible wax that she has.
It's all irritated.
And-Geez,
what would you call that? Um...
I guess it's a piercing.
I really don't know
how to describe it accurately...
but whatever it is,
it's flaring the lens.
- Ho, ho, ho. Cookie, sir?
- No, thank you.
- Christmas cookie. Go on, take one.
- Get away from me!
Well, the most important thing...
is to remain calm.
Honey. Honey.
Calm down.
Let's just start again.
Take the cable remote.
The one that says cable.
That's right.
Hit the power button.
What do you see?
Okay. Well, you probably
just changed the channel on the TV.
So get the TV remote.
Not cable, but TV.
That's right. Hit three.
Nope. That's impossible.
Is the TV plugged in?
I would like to have
electronic freedom. Um...
You must have a VCR and a cable box.
Does... your wife...
have this much trouble?
Let's not go there again,
shall we, Tobey?
Why is it so important for you to know
about my personal life? Hmm?
Let's keep this about you.
Um... you haven't
mentioned death today.
There-There is a phrase...
that you've uttered in, um, yes,
in every session, mm-hmm, so far.
"I mean, we're all going to die.
Doesn't that freak you out?"
And you never answer me.
Actually, it does seem to me...
that this whole kind of
television-TiVo tangent thing...
is really an elaborate avoidance...
for what's really going on.
And... what's really going on?
You tell me.
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!
Oh! Oh, my God!
That was...
That was good.
I mean, the candles and the whole...
lighting design in general.
- Thank you.
- That was some setup.
- Yeah.
- You...
You were like, um,
that guy from the Yankees.
That one. That, um-that pitcher
that they bring in at the end.
- Mariano Rivera, the closer?
- Yeah.
Huh. Huh. Heh.
He always looks so confident...
like he's gonna do
whatever it takes.
You know, he almost never
loses a game.
I bet he's got a really big family.
- No.
- Oh, I love...
those big Spanish families,
you know?
You know, they've got lots
and lots of kids.
Well, they're Catholic.
They're not allowed to use birth control.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about...
valuing cultural reproduction.
Well, maybe if they
valued cultural reproduction a little less...
we wouldn't be in the middle
of a population explosion...
that's running the risk
of using up all our natural resources.
I know you don't think that.
I do?
Do you believe in fate?
I'm not talking about the fact
that we're all fated to death...
but the fact that there are some things
that are meant to happen...
and some things
that are not meant to happen.
I have... no idea.
You don't, do you?
Ponson, Ponson, Ponson,
Hirsch, Jacoby and Ponson.
What's another kind of flower
you can get a woman other than a rose?
- What about an orchid?
- You kidding?
- That's even more expensive.
- Well, it must be an important occasion.
Just trying not to get
kicked out of my house.
You could go down to Central Park
and pull up something for free.
That's not a bad idea.
But I'd have to wrap it myself.
Elaine is not going to
kick you out of the house.
- She mentioned fate.
- Uh-oh.
I'd spring for the orchid.
What kind of porn you looking at?
Good old-fashioned
man-woman, woman-horse stuff.
- You're such a purist.
- I am.
I thought you were supposed to become
less horny when you turned 40.
- What?
- You can't give a woman berries, can you?
- Oh, I've taken a wrong turn somewhere.
- Ooh, I've gotta go.
I think I found
the flowers I want. Hi-oh!
- Hello?
- What kinda sale we talkin' about?
How did I get in here?
I'm gonna throw it to you next.
- Good throw.
- Me! Me! Mr. Ponson!
Mr. Ronson, throw it to me!
Throw it to me!
Hold on.
I'm gonna throw one to Liam.
- That was like fishing.
- Hey.
The rebel without a cause.
- Hey.
- Sorry, Mr. Ronson.
- Nice catch.
- Hi.
Uh, listen. The kids and I,
we're going up to Serendipity...
to celebrate the anniversary
of their father leaving us.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, honey.
Do you guys wanna come along?
- Wait. So you wrote that?
- Uh-huh.
- I love that commercial.
- Well...
"Got milk?" God, it just cuts
through all the bullshit.
It's-It's inspired.
Well, I wouldn't say it's inspired.
It's just simple.
So what did you do, like take time off
to write a book or something?
Uh, no. Not exactly.
- I've thought about that, but...
- Oh, you should. You'd be great.
Really. I have a sense
about these things.
Here.
Yep.
Author. Definitely.
You see that there?
Yeah, I do.
"Surrounded by friends,
she was happy and snug.
"She smiled to herself and said...
'Maybe life in the big
city isn't that bad after all. '
The end."
It would be crazy
not to publish this immediately.
It's very timely.
It's about a little girl
battling a dragon.
Right, but with
women's lib and all...
You see my point.
Oh, my God!
I hope they like it!
They're gonna love it.
- There's one thing.
- Oh, Tobey, come on. The book is finished.
Please, I ca-I can't make
any more changes in it.
Hey, it's not about
the content of the book, okay?
It's about the presentation.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- This picture?
Just seems so goody-good.
- Well, it is a children's book.
- Right. I know that.
But the people
who publish it aren't children.
This is, you know, just...
it's just slightly annoying,
you know?
Show some cleavage.
You actually think
I should show... cleavage?
Mmm. Yes, I d...
That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Are you crazy?
- What? Kids, they love the beach.
And this shows them that you're fun.
Don't underestimate that.
Wait a second.
You don't...
You don't think it's a little...
too much?
I wanna pay attention to that girl.
Standing at 3 foot 7...
weighing in at 47 pounds
of strapping lefty...
digs in.
- Got a hold of that!
- That's a home run!
- Yep. Touch 'em all.
- Hello!
What's goin' on?
Just a little thing
that we like to call spoonball!
Oh. Okay.
Well, Mommy's home.
Spoonball is over
before someone gets hurt.
Aw, come on, Mom.
Yeah, come on, Mom.
It's the bottom of the ninth!
We should be having boy time...
because my dad
made me have girl time.
- What do you mean, honey?
- Dad made me have a play date -
- with Shannon from my class.
- Really?
Nobody made you do anything, David.
- They invited us to Serendipity.
- Oh, really? They?
- Come on, Dad. Ritch it!
- Yep. Okay.
Ow! Oh!
- Ah-ah.
- Oh, my-Tom!
- Goddamn it!
- Let me see.
Dude, you only get one.
This is a complicated one.
I gotta get the wording right.
Got it.
- Yea.
- Yea. I gotta hit the head.
Please don't ask her anything
inappropriate in front of me.
I can ask her whatever I want.
For such a closed-off person,
it's like you have no boundaries.
It's better than living surrounded
by the Great Wall of China.
What does that mean?
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.
- It means you're closed off.
- Like a Chinese person?
No, Tom. It means you like to talk,
but about nothing important...
so then whenever your emotion or resentment
or whatever dark stuff you have builds up -
- you throw a spoon at me.
- I didn't throw the spoon.
- David threw the spoon.
- We've a minute to talk before he gets back.
So, um, anything come up?
Did he say anything at all?
- No. He's been really busy.
- Busy? Tobey, busy?
Stay out of it.
It's fine! It's just our lifestyle
these days.
I mean, it's not just our lifestyle.
It's our whole society's
lifestyle, you know?
I mean, there are
a lot of people who are...
tethered by an old-fashioned
sense of love...
and, uh, family...
and sometimes I look at them
and I wonder...
if living such a simple life...
can actually be
completely gratifying...
and if they understand
how rich and fertile...
living in the gray area is.
I mean, because
it's all really about being happy.
- Right?
- Honey...
No. Do I wish that there was
a little bit more romance? Yes.
Of course I do.
But it's an ebb, a flow.
It's shifting,
and I'm on that journey.
- What'd I miss?
- That's all there is to it.
Honey.
Looks like I finally
digested that corn.
What?
- How much further?
- Just one more block.
Come on.
We're close.
Why'd you park so far away?
This is the only
legal spot after 11:00.
What the fuck?
My car is gone!
It was right here!
Well...
They probably towed it.
Can we just get a cab?
I'm freezing.
But this is a legal spot!
They didn't tow this guy's car!
Oh, I swear to God...
Tobey, would you shut up?
Please!
All right. It's-It's...
It's okay, Elaine.
They just tow it to the pound.
We can get it out.
I want to get married
and have a baby!
And you don't.
Okay. Let's just get a cab.
Oh, sh-I have wasted...
seven years of my life with you!
Oh, shit.
I need... you...
to find somewhere else
to stay tonight.
Hey!
Hello?
Honey-Honey, what is it?
What happened?
Aw, sweetie.
He did?
Oh, that fucking car!
Hey, what's going on? Rebecca's on
the other line with her right now.
Hi, Tom.
- Pamela?
- I hope I'm not getting you at a bad time.
Um, no, no. I was just, uh,
relieving myself.
- What?
- I mean, uh...
Hello?
I mean I-I'm just...
I'm-I'm relieved that it's you.
Good.
Come in.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.
- You look a little tense.
- Oh. You think?
Whoa.
Yeah. I guess I am a little tense.
Yeah. Let me just...
You're strong.
Have you ever had a, uh...
ever had a problem,
you know...
I guess you haven't been listening to me
for the last 15 years.
No, like-like...
like another woman problem.
Issue.
What, do you have one?
- Tom?
- Please don't say anything.
- I'm not sure what's going on...
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey!
Hey. Hi. Oh!
You're the last person
I expect to see.
Yeah, well.
Here I am.
Eating soup.
Yeah.
- Yeah. You remember Tom?
- Hi.
Are you okay? You look tired.
Uh, well, actually, um...
Elaine and I split up...
about, uh-about three weeks ago.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, it was
a long relationship...
- You know what? I'm gonna go.
- Okay.
Oh, wait. I thought we were
gonna go see a movie together.
- I gotta check something out.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going, asshole.
- Sorry.
- Shit!
- Honey! Honey, look who's here.
Did you see this prick
that just knocked into me?
- I should have smacked him upside the head.
- No. No, don't do that.
- Honey, remember Tobey?
- Hey.
- What's up, bro?
- Hey. Oh!
- All right.
- Oh!
Paper covers rock.
Remember that?
Hey, do you like music?
You know? 'Cause Rand
is promoting this great new club...
and it's really-it's really hot.
- Yeah. You know.
- Oh!
Oh, well, I'd love to.
- I mean, if that's an invitation.
- Absolutely!
- Yes. I just need an e-mail address.
- I... come... clubbing.
Uh... yeah.
It's...
A-S...
S-M...
A-N-2...
- 0-4 at AOL.com.
- Okay.
Got it.
One through 203 were taken.
Okay. Well, I will
e-mail you the details then.
- All right. My man.
- Assman.
- Bye.
- Okay.
- Hi. Are you...
- Norah.
Norah? Wow! Hi.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I was afraid that they
weren't gonna let you sit down.
Oh, it was difficult,
but I finally managed to persuade them.
I never imagined
when I submitted my book...
that it would elicit a response
from the head of the company.
I'm grateful you agreed to see me,
actually.
Are you kidding?
Do you know who you are?
I think so.
I'm sorry.
That was-that was crass.
I just got out of a relationship
with a crass man...
nothing to do with gardening.
Anyway, I don't know.
I say these things.
I don't know where they come from.
Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Are you okay? Jesus.
I'm fine. I'm just wet.
You're choking.
No, because I called.
Because I left a message for you.
Would you...
Would you just fuck you for just a...
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm really sorry.
Excuse me. I-I...
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
No, you know, I'm a little tense today.
Susie, you know I...
I love talking to you...
but I don't think
that on my cell phone right now is...
She's horrible.
She called me this morning,
and she's screaming at me.
I'm really in very bad shape.
Basically I'm exhausted.
The bank is calling me all the time,
and the contractor called twice.
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing here.
Really, really difficult day.
The lady who lives upstairs
from me...
that horrible bitch
I'm always fighting with?
Douche bag!
I want to start off this meeting
by first thanking Sensei Goldberg...
for the use of his dojo.
I would like to also welcome the sensei
as our newest member...
of the Broadway division
of Sex Addicts R' Us.
So that means if you are here...
for the previously scheduled seminar on
owning your orgasm, you're in the wrong place.
Shit.
It's been moved to the basement
of Our Lady of Poland on 34th street.
- Thirty fourth?
- Yeah.
Are you here for the meeting?
What? The meeting?
Yes. The meeting?
Yeah. The meeting. Yeah. I thought...
I thought I'd check it out.
Welcome. Your name?
- Tobey.
- Hi, Tobey.
Well, my friend Rebecca says...
she thinks that men
are never really ready to have a baby...
and that you have to trap them.
What do you think?
I don't really think about it.
But I certainly think you shouldn't be
spending your energy trying to trap a man.
You're way too talented.
I believe in fate.
I think you're meant
to have this time, Elaine.
You're meant to-to explore.
Sounds like you need it.
I don't know what I need.
Well, I think you know more
than you're willing to admit.
This is me.
Oh. Sweet.
Thank you so much for lunch
and for the walk.
It was delicious, don't you think?
Yes.
So do you think that
there's any chance...
you're gonna publish my book?
You know, Elaine,
you're a very talented young woman...
and, quite frankly...
I was very taken with the photo
you sent with your submission.
- Mm-hmm.
- But I want to be honest with you.
I don't like to rush these things.
- I like to go slow.
- Okay.
So let's meet and see how it goes.
Okay.
Ah, get a room.
It was never enough.
No matter how many times...
different positions...
none of it made me feel whole.
In fact, it just made me
feel empty.
How's the sandwich?
Okay, so... just a recap.
Uh, John is not happy...
unless he can fit his penis
inside a hard, inanimate object.
Preferably coarse.
Right. Sarah, you had
a relapse this week...
again putting yourself in danger
with a power tool.
And, uh, Gordon...
the sex you are having
with your wife's mother...
and your wife's mother's sister
is putting your homelife in major jeopardy.
That leaves...
Tobey.
- I'll pass.
- Great. Sandwich guy's gonna pass?
Great. Very trusting.
It's traditional
that everyone shares.
Well...
I've been having an affair.
With a woman...
who is not my wife.
And, um,
I, uh...
I like her to wrap me in deli meats.
I need her
to wrap me in deli meats...
in order to achieve an orgasm.
Usually ham.
Thinly sliced.
I know it's not normal.
No one here knows
what that word means, Tobey.
You're amongst friends.
Continue.
And hand me the sandwich.
Am I allowed to wear fur?
Do I, like, give off that vibe?
- Is she attractive?
- So funny.
Afterwards, all I wanted to do
was tell Tobey.
He would have died of excitement...
a possible threesome.
I had a threesome once.
It was with two guys
who turned out to be gay.
I was just kind of
the window dressing.
It all made sense in retrospect...
but I can't tell you
what it did for my self-esteem.
Yeah. It seems really damaged.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.
You know, I don't get
what people think of me...
that I have no
problems or feelings...
I'm perfect, I'm like a robot?
No, honey.
Nobody thinks that.
We all think you're great.
We all have problems.
You know, I always thought of a relationship
as two people holding a stick.
Sometimes the stick is short and you're close
and you can look into each other's eyes...
and other times it's long and you can
barely see the other person...
but you both always
hold onto your end of the stick.
You don't let it drop.
I'm okay.
I'm just stressed.
We should go out.
Just you and me.
Jesus, what?
I just thought of
a great guy for you.
Oh... I don't know.
No weapons in the club.
If you got a weapon, you gotta give 'em up
at the door. No exceptions.
Would you move?
All right.
Make room for her.
Hey, Wall Street,
make way for the lady.
- Hey. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you. Have a good time.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you're here.
- I'm glad I didn't bring my piece.
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.
- Uh-Where's-Wh-Where's, uh...
- Rand?
He couldn't make it.
Oh-Oh, I'm sorry
he couldn't make it.
- He, uh...
- I'm not.
Oh, come on.
Let's dance.
Oh, no-no. No-No, I don't...
I'm not-That's not really my thing.
Come on!
More of a slow dancer.
All right.
Thank you.
Hey, baby. Will you hold this for me?
Thank you. Hold my horn.
Uh, that's a little something we call
"Serenade for a French Horn...
in F-sharp."
This next one...
we call "Juniper."
And if any of you out there
know what a juniper plant is...
I think you'll understand.
Peace.
Oh, my God.
He just bowed to you.
- It wasn't to me.
- It wasn't to me.
- He doesn't even know me.
- I told him all about you already.
- When?
- On the phone.
Oh, my God.
I didn't even bow back.
I'll introduce you to him after,
and you can bow then.
Hey, you guys, that was great.
So flowing, man. I could feel it tonight...
Hey! How's the comedienne?
Oh. Mmm.
Oh, my God.
- Oh! Oh, dizzy.
- You taste as good as ever.
- You were great tonight.
- Oh, thank you.
You were.
You were really good.
Well, I was just working off that energy
that you were sending up to me.
Whew! You have
a really beautiful voice.
Well, I can't take credit
for that, you know?
It's all the big man.
Hey!
You know, ever since
I became a minister...
my vocal range
has just gotten insane.
- You're a minister?
- Yes, yes.
But don't worry.
Ministers are free to fornicate.
Should we get a drink?
Lots of'em.
Go! Go!
Tobey! Tobey! Tobey! Tobey!
Go, baby.
OwI Watch it!
Sorry.
Dante. Lewis, buddy.
- Good to see you.
- Look at you.
What is the deal with you two?
Oh, come on.
"You taste as good as ever"?
We had a thing in college.
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to discourage you.
- Mmm.
- He's sexy!
And very... attentive.
Oh.
He really is a freak, isn't he?
You don't have to marry the guy.
- So, what are we gonna do about this?
- This?
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it...
every time we've seen each other
since college.
Uh-Oh, I-I-I've thought about it.
Uh...
- Sure, you're-you're-you're...
- I'm what?
- Very...
- Very what?
Uh...
Talk dirty to me.
You taste amazing.
Thank you.
Um-Um, could you...
could you...
could you stop doing whatever that it is
that you were just doing...
and... leave?
Oh.
I would be wearing...
shorts.
And you would...
be in a swimsuit?
- Oh, God. Just relax.
- I'm sorry.
It's just, you know,
you have a... husband.
Rand.
- What kind of name is that anyway?
- Oh, ah...
Mm-mmm. No.
- Doesn't matter. Okay?
- None of it matters, Tobey.
I mean, in 50 years,
we're gonna be dead...
and nobody's gonna remember us
or even know we existed.
- So, come on.
- In 50 years, I'm only gonna be 86.
Mmm. Whatever.
My point is that
this is all so temporary...
so let's just enjoy it.
Please?
Elaine.
- Elaine!
- Hey-Hey...
Elaine... is asleep.
She's gone to bed.
Uh, wait...
You were just up there?
Yes. Yes, I was.
Nothing to write home about.
I think I got a song out of it.
Why would you do that?
You know I invited
Elaine and her new boyfriend.
I know, but he just looks so pathetic.
And, you know...
- I forgot.
- You did not forget, Tom.
Well, he's just blathering on
about how much he misses Elaine.
He can't function without her.
He's gotta see her.
You know, I wanted somebody here who
doesn't know anything about the theater -
- so I could have somebody to talk to.
- Right. Fine.
He's sitting far away
from Elaine. Next to Amis.
The guy in the yellow turtleneck?
Rebecca, he's your brother.
Don't do that to him.
- My man.
- I, uh -
- brought a bottle of wine.
- Thank you.
That's what you're supposed to do
at a dinner party, right?
- Very grown-up.
- Yep. Hey.
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello?
Your door was wide open.
- Hi. Hi, my name's Tom.
- Hi. You look so pretty.
- Thank you.
- So pretty. Hi.
- Goren.
- Nice to meet you. Hi, Elaine.
- Hello.
- Hi, hi. Nice to see you... again.
Oh, wow. Wow, that was a lot of kisses.
- Hello.
- Hey. Tobey.
- Tobey. Tobey.
- Let me take your coat.
- Hiya.
- Here you go.
- Yeah.
- Take your coat too.
- Come on. Take it off.
- All right.
No, the theater. No, no, no...
the theater is completely different.
I mean, it's all star-driven,
you know?
Stars, stars, stars.
They can't walk. They can't talk.
I mean, it's just like the film industry
where you hail from, my dear.
Actually, Amis,
I hail from New Jersey.
No? New Jers...
Charming.
Charming as ever.
Tom, you are a lucky man.
Spunk doesn't usually come
in such a beautiful package.
You know, I...
I think it's this, uh...
these departures...
from the literatures
which-which makes it worse...
in this society's, uh...
It goes, uh...
the-the wrongest.
- What?
- What do you mean, Goren?
No. No, yeah...
It-It's-Because it is this,
uh, connection...
between the past and the futures.
Uh-Well, because it-it was there
before any of the other arts.
- Except painting.
- And dance.
This is great wine.
Isn't it.
So, Goren, are you...
technically a citizen?
There are more than one, um...
places for which, uh,
to be citizens with than this one.
So, what, you're on like
a limited visa or something?
You all right?
- I am. I'm...
- Are you okay?
Wow! This is good soup.
- Tobey! We can't do this.
- What? What do-What do-What do you mean?
It's all right.
They're, you know...
We're not together anymore.
Do you get that?
But it-But it's not right
for me, Elaine.
Ah-It-I mean,
it's Tobey and Elaine.
That sounds right to me.
Those two names.
It's-They-They-They go together.
That's your plea?
That our names go together?
It seems right.
It's not right.
I'm just starting with someone new,
and I'm happy.
That...
That-That-sprocket out there?
He's in a unitard, for Chrissakes!
Better. That is the Tobey
that I know.
Oh, oh, oh,
"I think 'The Canterbury Tales'...
"really provides a basis
for all of the modern literatures.
- And watch me dance."
- You know, you're right, Tobey.
You've-You hit the nail
on the head! He is.
- He's a pretentious sprocket.
- Yes!
He's a pretentious sprocket...
with a huge cock!
No-Well, he-he-he does not look...
like he has a huge cock.
Well, he does. And you...
you don't know what
a relationship is.
Boy, that water pressure in there
really sucks.
Mmm. It's been a long time, hasn't it?
Where'd she find this guy,
Zorro, anyway?
It's Goren.
And let's not talk about him.
I gotta be up early for "Mommy and Me".
Okay.
"That's not really fair to say, now is it?
We've known each other for a long time.
I think we deserve each other's honesty."
"I have been in love with you
since the moment I saw you."
"You only think you have."
- "What's the difference?"
- That's a cocksucker of a speech.
How come I didn't get
the cursing gene?
You know, I've never had
this much trouble remembering my lines.
It must be menopause.
Becca, you're 38. And would you please
not talk about your vagina? You're my sister.
It's bad enough that my best friend
has sex with you.
Walk back to the theater
with me, would ya?
Hey! What the fuck?
Hey!
Hey-Hey-Hey.
Evel Knievel, what the fuck?
Since when do you smoke?
I know he's seeing someone.
You know, I wasn't really sure,
but that look confirmed it.
Hey, that's not fair. You said you already
knew he was seeing someone.
- So he is?
- No, I-I-I...
I mean, I-I-I know nothing.
I'm not the guy who tells
someone something like that.
I refuse to be
forced into being that guy.
This is not about you, you little
fucking twit. Hey, you hit me!
You know, Tom's right about you.
You're the, uh, what did he call you?
The play-by-play guy. That's what you call
him, right, the guy who sits in the booth...
and talks about everything
that's goin' on without ever playing.
Never fucking participating.
Just letting life pass you by.
- Never participating!
- Well, if I'm that guy...
then he's the quarterback who wants to
screw everything with two legs.
To continue the...
the metaphor, that is.
Fuck!
Thanks for reading with me, Tobey.
I'm sorry. I'm so...
Oh, hey.
Cosmos...
would you be a sweetheart
and let Mr. Ronson in?
He's already here, Mom.
So they're really
that sensitive, huh?
Women don't seem
to believe that, but, yes, they are.
Oh, so now I'm being lumped
with all women?
- Pamela, we need to talk about somethin'.
- No.
I know what you're gonna say.
And you're right. But...
But I don't want to.
Look, I can't...
I can't do this anymore.
We have to stop this.
- Hey, you wanna see what Cosmos taught me?
- Sure.
Oh!
- Mommy!
- Hey, is that my big boy?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, we didn't expect you to be home.
Well, I-I missed my family,
so I came home early.
- Are you wearing cologne?
- No.
David learned some interesting
things on his play date today.
Oh, really. Like what?
I learned how to silence someone!
- How do you do that?
- You hit them in the balls.
Oh.
Yep.
That sounds like a good idea.
Okay, everybody, let's get ready
for dinner. Come on. Let's go.
Whoops. Okay.
Here you go, buddy.
Watch your hand.
- Here you go. Oh, sorry.
- Oops.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Enjoy.
- You okay?
- Um...
I'm thinking about
dropping out of the play.
What? Why?
Things aren't working
out the way I want them to.
Rebecca, you always have these moments
of doubts before an opening.
- You know? I was...
- Not about so many things.
What are you doin', Tom?
I look at you, I feel like I don't even know
who you are anymore.
- And maybe that's my fault.
- No.
It's not your fault. I, uh...
I just-I feel lost.
And, uh, I don't know
who I am right now.
You should leave, Tom,
till you figure it out.
We can't do it for you.
What a good boy.
Eatin' all that spaghetti.
Sorry, I'm late.
It's all the idiots.
- Could you explain to me the psychology...
- Tobey...
behind the people who wait in a long line
at the store and don't take their money out...
until their total is rung up,
as if it's a surprise?
"Oh, you want money for this?
"Well, I had no idea.
Wait, while I unzip my fanny pack...
and dig through my man-purse
for my wallet."
So, do you think
you might be avoiding the issue?
- What issue is that?
- That you've been following me?
I think not.
Oh. Oh! That was you.
I thought-I thought it might have been,
but there was just, you know -
- so much of a coincidence.
- What were you hoping to find out, Tobey?
That I'm a Libra?
That I had a heart attack?
Oh, you had a heart attack?
I also had a withholding father
and an inappropriate mother.
And when I was 20, I had a nervous breakdown.
And, I think it's time
to terminate your therapy.
I'm sorry?
Well, this is not working out.
Well, Tobey, not for you
and not for me.
Okay.
Have a little trust, Tobey.
The world is not against you.
I mean, no wonder
his advice was so bad.
He had a nervous breakdown.
A heart attack.
Messed up parents.
I mean, could he be
any more unhealthy?
He said something to me, though,
when I left, that really bugged me.
He said, "The world is not against
you, Tobey. Have a little trust."
Well, that kinda goes
against my whole philosophy.
"The world is not against me." Huh? I
mean, well, then how do you explain my life?
Jesus Christ!
Can you just shut up?
I mean, I-I don't have time
for this bullshit about your shrink.
Have you noticed that I've been kicked out
of my house and my life is falling apart?
Oh, yeah. Okay.
I gotta go.
Do you think I should get Botox?
- Definitely.
- Really?
Uh-huh. If you wanna
lose me as your friend.
You're so strict.
I saw that bitch at school.
She actually said "hi" to me.
- What did you do?
- Oh, I showed her.
I said "hi" back and smiled.
And then I just walked away.
She must be reeling.
- How are the kids doing?
- They're okay.
He comes by to see them every day.
I just can't bear to look at him.
He's in that overly sweet
hangdog stage...
where I could set him on fire,
and he'd thank me for it.
It's not a bad idea.
How's "Goren the Terrible"?
Terribly boring.
He does wanna have a baby though.
Hey, can I have a blintze...
this early?
It's all I've been thinking
about since last night.
It's a-It's an acceptable
crossover food, right?
Why do you think
we're such wiseasses?
Probably a good way to avoid thinking
about the fact that we're all gonna die.
When are you gonna get over that?
Um...
never.
It's a pretty big deal.
You know what I think?
I think it's a good way...
to avoid taking
responsibility for anything.
It's like, "Hey, we're only joking, right?
We're all gonna die, right?"
You and me, we're missing
the biggest moments of our lives...
'cause all we can talk about
is sports and blintzes.
It's just it's, uh...
it's pretty depressing
not living with your kids.
Or the woman you love.
Or the woman that you love.
Just because you happen to be an immensely
flawed and selfish human being.
Hey, you're not so great yourself.
I think the blintze is fully acceptable
as a crossover food...
and I would like one myself.
- You're the man.
- No, you the man.
Up top.
I guess
the first thing I should say...
is that my name is not Tobey.
It's Todd.
Hi, Todd.
No, it's not-It's, uh, it's Tom.
My name is Tom.
It really is, okay?
And, uh, secondly...
I have-I have no relation
at all to deli meats.
I just made it up to try to fit in.
I don't know...
I don't know what I am...
but, um, I'm pretty sure
that I have a problem.
Although, not as-as big
a problem as all of you seem to have.
Um, anybody else hot?
Uh, I, uh...
I also use humor and, uh,
complaints about the temperature...
as a way of diverting attention...
from the, uh,
from the very serious fact, uh...
that I'm ruining my life.
And, uh...
I just-I just thought it would do me
some good to tell my real story here today.
So, uh...
I, uh, I come from a family
of poor peasants.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm just kiddin'. Um...
It-It's hims, again.
Mabel? George?
Come here, please.
Now Mr. Bertram
will be joining us for dinner tonight.
Rlease make the arrangements.
All right, Debbie.
Confound it,
where is that daughter of mine?
Oh, Daddy, I'm comin'.
- Trust us.
- Trust us.
- We're all about trust.
- Come on.
- Okay. Here you go.
- Come on.
Come in.
Popular lady.
I think these are
from your husband. Again.
- Break a leg.
- Thank you.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry to interrupt
your preshow cry.
All the best ones have 'em.
We're all
in this together, my dear.
All damned to the theater.
Condemned to live through our art.
For we do not know
how to live through our lives.
We are islands.
Francis...
my director...
I am a mother and a wife first
and foremost...
and you should go fuck yourself.
Welcome to tonight's...
premiere performance
of Edmund Middleton's Fifty Means.
Oh, these are good seats.
- Okay.
- Enjoy the show.
That should be me.
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.
You go on back to the house.
I'll get the rest.
I never thought
I'd say this, but I'm happy to be home.
Nothing much has changed
around here, but then again, it never does.
I'm miserable.
And seein' you miserable
isn't helping any.
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
We gotta do somethin'.
There she is.
You go talk to her.
And you go find a pen
and a piece of paper.
Hey. I thought that was you.
Tobey.
- Not now, okay?
- You don't return my calls.
I need a, uh, pen and a piece of paper.
It's an emergency.
Tobey, why do you
have to make this so hard?
Elaine, it's hard for me too.
Oh, my goodness!
Listens, I-I want you
to stop calling the houses...
and, I-I want you
to stays away from her for all the times.
Why is everything plural
with this guy?
Oh, insult face to my faces?
- Tobey.
- What?
- This is Rebecca's night, okay?
- What? What? I know.
- I'm sorry, I dropped the pen there.
- Oh, I'll get it.
Hey.
- Those aren't your flowers, sir.
- You don't understand.
I need to get these
to Rebecca Pollack backstage. So...
I'm sorry, she doesn't accept
stolen flowers in intermissions.
Oh, no. Can you at least just...
Can you get her this note?
I'm her husband.
Please, just give her that.
- We're talkin'here, "Gorens."
- Come.
- I'm talkin' to her, if you don't mind.
- I do mind.
- It's not gonna happen.
- I said I'd like to talk to her.
- Release her.
- I'm not gonna release her.
Okay. Wait a minute!
Hey! That's not...
No running. No running.
- Stop it!
- You "shtop" it!
Sir, there's no running in the theater.
Oh, my God.
Sir, stay right there.
There's no running in the theater.
There's no running in the theater.
We got a runner. We got a runnerI Okay.
Oh! Pardon me.
West aisle.
- Come on!
- Sorry.
- Hey! Watch it. You're a jerk.
- Oh, God!
- Right there, sweetheart.
- Ow!
Why are you sweating?
I saw Goren.
I pushed him into a plant.
I stole some flowers.
- Oh, that sounds great. Good job.
- Yeah, you too.
Mrs. Pollack, final scene is up.
Thank you.
Who knows if she'll ever
come out of that room.
But I wouldn't blame her
if she didn't.
Hell, comin'back here
after so long, for what?
For us?
For this place?
Somehow, It doesn't make
a whole lotta sense to me.
- The night air. It feels good.
- This is the last line of the play.
- You know it does, Laura.
- So what?
I gotta do something.
Excuse me. Sorry.
I never thought I'd be able to say that again.
- Stop it!
- Let me just get through here. Rardon me.
Oh!
Give me back my hair!
Give me my hair!
Stop him!
Ushers, full alert!
East aisle. Stage approach.
Stop!
Hey!
Get off!
It's okay.
This is my husband.
This loser?
This loser.
Bravo.
Elaine!
Did you like the play?
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait!
You're the one for me!
Is this part of the play?
Yes, yes. Yes.
It is part of the play.
Uh, uh, this is the part...
of the play
where we come together...
and never leave each other.
And some...
somehow I feel like it...
it was written a long time ago,
and I just...
I just didn't trust the script,
'cause I don't wanna die.
- What?
- Wha...
Why do I always
have to be equated with death?
- I agree.
- What-Wait...
Th-That didn't come out right. I...
I don't want to be a cold,
sarcastic, blocked-off man anymore.
I'm not gonna be.
And, it's not gonna be easy...
but I wanna struggle...
with you.
I love you.
And...
all I can do is say that
and let you do with it what you will.
And if you...
if you won't be with me...
I can accept that.
'Cause I-I want you to be happy.
Tobey. Tobey.
I have tried...
very hard to stop.
But somehow, I still love you.
Oh, my God. Thank God!
'Cause all that stuff I was saying about
being able to let you go, that was just crap.
I'd have to hunt you down. Who wants to
spend all their life doin' that...
when there's some many other
things to do before we d...
Sure, I'll be right back.
And how are you doing here?
Oh, God.
Do I look fat here?
Which one are you?
- You look great.
- Excuse me.
I don't mean to bother you...
but I recognized you from your book.
My son and I have spent so many great days
in New York together because of you.
Would you sign it for me, please?
Sure.
You must be a great daddy.
Thank you.
We're very proud of him.
Oh.
Oh, yes. We are very proud of him.
Okay.
Here's how it's gonna go.
I'm gonna get up
and go into the bathroom on the left.
Wait one minute...
and then you come in.
One, two, three...
Seventeen, 18...
nineteen-Daddy will be right back.
Twenty-four, 25, 26...
Forty-three...
Elaine has found in Tobey...
a man she can trust to love her...
to be her rock-solid baseline.
In Elaine, Tobey
has found his life's melody -
- his grace note.
- Come on now. Thank you. Hey.
Do you, Tobias, take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife...
to have and to hold,
until death do you part?
could you not mention death?
Uh, uh, "as long
as we both shall live."
- I do.
- I do.
- Yea!
- Whoo! Say "booyah."
- Booyah!
- Booyah!
Put me down!
Hey, Tobey...
I'm proud of you.
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Baby, baby, go, go! Get him!
I just got married.
Come on, that's legal.
- I was behind the...
- That's our car!
Every time!
Every time!
All right all you plant lovers...
you people lovers,
you life lovers...
this one's called "Juniper."
And it goes like this.
