Nor are they science fiction.

3

They are real.

4
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,058
Creatures of our own world.

5

6
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,732

7
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,269
KATE: Coral mountains
rise more than half a mile. . .

8
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,688
...from the floor of the Caribbean Sea.

9
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,942
They were built, inch by inch,
over centuries...

...by billions of coral animals.

11
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,907
But the animals didn't do it alone.

12
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,201
Tiny plants living inside the coral. . .

13
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,538
...capture energy from the sun
to make its food.

14
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,375
Neither plant nor coral. . .

15
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,378
...can survive without the other.

16
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,797
And that's the key:

17
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,135
The whole reef community
is built on relationships.

18
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,142
Little fish live here.

19
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,943
JOHNNY:
And big fish eat little fish.

20
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,989
He's a 1 00-pound black grouper.

21
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,991
And he's always hungry.

22
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,920
But for the community
to remain in balance...

23
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:00,007
...the prey needs a fair chance
at survival too.

24
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:05,137
And nature provides some ingenious ways
to even the odds.

25
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,849
Take the frogfish.

26
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,311
He hides from predators
by looking like a sponge.

27
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,777
In his disguise.. .

28
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,530

mounted on his forehead.

30

on the ledge is hoping to catch one.

33
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,355
KATE: The shimmering
school dances for good reason.

34
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,067
JOHNNY: lt's very hard for
the grouper to isolate a single minnow.

35
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,319
And he often fails.

36
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,580
KATE:
There's more diversity here...

37
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,582
...than anywhere else on Earth.

38
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,586
And every single citizen,
from the tiniest fish. ..

39
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:25,009
...to the ferocious tiger shark,
must depend upon others to survive.

40
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,018
JOHNNY: The balance between
predator and prey is always shifting.

41
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,605
But the community stays healthy
and whole...

42
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:42,276
...because there are so many different
relationships between so many species.

43
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,445
Sometimes...

44
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,530
...even the coral itself is prey.

He eats coral.

47

JOHNNY: Too many of these
could wipe out an entire reef.

48
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,425
KATE:
The triton trumpet snail hunts sea stars.

49
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,305
JOHNNY:
Although the snail is almost blind. ..

50
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,892
...it can smell the sea star's trail.

51
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,731
KATE:
Those nasty thorns are full of venom.

52
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,734
JOHNNY:
But the snail is immune.

53
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,656
KATE: What's that?
JOHNNY: lt's called a proboscis.

54
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,952
JOHNNY: And he'll use it
to drill through the star's leathery hide.

55
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,666
Then he'll inject a venom. . .

56
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,128
...that will dissolve the sea star
from the inside out.

57
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,715
KATE: So the triton
trumpet snail helps save the coral.

58
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:52,805
And that helps keep
the reef's ecosystem in balance.

59

KATE:
The spotted coney is the patient.

64
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,452

...removing and eating parasites.

66
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,543
Both species benefit.

67
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,296
lt's called symbiosis.

Away from this spot...

70
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,474
...the barracuda might swallow
the little Spanish hogfish whole.

71
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:46,525
KATE: When he's being
cleaned, the barracuda calls a truce.

72
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,779
The cleaning station is a sanctuary.

73
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,344
Green sea turtles love coming
to this reef near the island of Hawaii.

74

But even coming from miles away...

77
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,815
...they somehow manage
to find this special spot.

78
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,280
When algae accumulates on their shells,
it can really slow them down.

79
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,742
But the reef fish give them a good scrub.

80
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,456
In exchange, the turtles give the reef fish
a healthy vegetarian feast.

JOHNNY:
That pulsing is how it swims.

89
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,513
Each pulse also forces
tiny animals inward. . .
