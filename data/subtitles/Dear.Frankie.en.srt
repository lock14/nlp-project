<i>Dear Da, did you know something?</i>

3
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,553
<i>We're moving again.</i>

4
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,187
<i>Ma says it's time.</i>

5
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,067
<i>She says it's definitely the last time.</i>

6
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,827
<i>But she says that every single time.</i>

7
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,068
<i>Nana says,</i>

8
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,787
<i>if there is a next time,</i>

9
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:31,912
<i>she'll have to be carried out in a box.</i>

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,039
<i>And Ma says, don't tempt her.</i>

11
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,120
# Everyone Will Have Their Day

12
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,042
# And if tomorrow only brings
our just deserts

13
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:49,758
# We'll still get through

14
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,641
# I know we'll be all right

15
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:58,731
# Cue the marching drums

16
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:01,488
# We'll stumble through tonight

17
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:04,856
# Until the morning comes

18
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,734
# And everyone will have their day

19
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,624
# Though many trying days might break

20
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:21,501
# Take time before you make a change

21
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:25,256
# Your time is gonna come your way...

22
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:27,503
<i>And did you know</i>
<i>something else, Da?</i>

23
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:31,013
<i>This time... This time,</i>
<i>we're living right on the edge of the sea.</i>

24
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,974
<i>Right on the edge of the world.</i>

25
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:40,934
<i>Lizzie, I still cannae get it.</i>

26
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:43,779
Gonnae miss my programme.

27
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:47,315
<i>You'll need to do something.</i>
<i>You'll need to get the man in.</i>

28
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,817
Away to the chip shop
and get us a couple of fish suppers.

29
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,790
You want to encourage that boy to speak more.

30
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,087
There's nothing wrong with his voice.
He's got a lovely wee voice.

31
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,005
You should encourage it more.

32
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,807
Between that and that other thing...

33
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,811
<i>- Is that it?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:22,562
One, two, three, four...

35
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,811
<i>Oh Marie!</i>
<i>Come on, give us a break!</i>

36
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,862
Oh, keep your hair on! It's a joke.

37
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,111
Right, you two, beat it.

38
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,735
And don't annoy me for the rest of the week,
OK?

39
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,490
<i>Right, who's next?</i>

40
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,704
OK.

41
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,242
Right.

42
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,390
Your wish is my command.

43
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,239
Just on the one?

44
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,408
Aye, no bother.

45
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,157
Right.

46
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,119
OK, is that it?

47
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:28,049
How old are you?

48
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,549
Yeah, well, come back in six and a half years.

49
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,393
Just you go back down there
and tell Madam Muck

50
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,885
<i>that you want a packet of Embassy Regal.</i>

51
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,221
<i>And if she gives you any more of her lip,</i>

52
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:45,731
tell her I'll come down
and batter more than her fish.

53
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:48,696
Are you that desperate?

54
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:57,320
And that was that. Know what I mean?

55
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,572
Excuse me. 20 Embassy Regal.

56
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,575
Er... there's a queue.

57
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,368
My boy's already queued.
And before you ask, I am 16, so...

58
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:08,500
Yeah, and the rest.
OK, hold your horses. I'll do you next.

59
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,917
<i>Come on there's a queue!</i>
<i>- Oh, God almighty!</i>

60
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,383
She only wants a packet of fags!

61
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:17,558
What was the problem, anyway?
Could you not understand him?

62
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:21,343
I understood him perfectly.
He's a smart wee cookie.

63
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:22,600
For a deaf kid?

64
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:25,388
For his age.

65
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,108
Thanks.

66
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,864
<i>Dear Da, thanks for the stamps.</i>

67
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,342
<i>The Great White Shark's the best.</i>

68
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,340
<i>Maybe the best you've ever sent.</i>

69
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:02,217
<i>Ma says she'll buy me a new album</i>
<i>when this one's full.</i>

70
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,974
You left while I was sleeping,

71
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,854
Taken from my loving arm,

72
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:13,111
And now I'm left to grieve here,
broken like a doll.

73
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,989
Jesus Christ, that doesn't even rhyme.

74
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:20,035
They're supposed to rhyme.

75
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,322
Just you make sure mine rhymes.

76
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,454
Oh, don't bother. I'll write it myself.

77
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,631
It's wishful thinking, you know.
You won't find his name in there.

78
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,673
Well, he's got to die sometime.

79
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,131
<i>Did you know something, Da?</i>

80
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:45,394
<i>Did you know a Great White</i>
<i>can jump right out of the water</i>

81
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,058
<i>and knock over a boat?</i>

82
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:51,187
<i>Not your boat, though. Your boat's ginormous.</i>

83
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,156
<i>And guess what else, Da? Guess what?</i>

84
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,648
<i>From my window, I can see the sea.</i>

85
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,411
You have to wear it.

86
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,124
Did you do the toilet?

87
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:59,297
It's a big day tomorrow.
You'll need to get to sleep now.

88
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,116
- Miss?
- Yes?

89
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,665
What does it feel like to be deaf?

90
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:37,546
Brilliant. You wouldnae be able to hear your ma
shouting at you to do stuff all the time.

91
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:44,966
Miss, is it like when your ears are all blocked,
and everything feels like it's miles away?

92
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,631
Well, that's certainly one way to think about it.

93
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:52,769
But just remember,
you don't have to shout at him all the time.

94
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,055
Do you hear me, Ricky?

95
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,108
Sorry, Miss, did you say something?

96
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,119
<i>I don't want him treated any different.</i>

97
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:13,117
Well, let's give it a couple of weeks.
If he's struggling, we'll let you know.

98
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,046
He won't struggle.
There's nothing wrong with his brain.

99
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:17,874
Is there, Frankie?

100
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:22,173
A word to the wise.
Watch what you say in front of him.

101
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:24,219
He's a champion lip-reader.

102
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:28,758
<i>Dr Knickerbocker,</i>
<i>Knickerbocker, number nine</i>

103
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,809
<i># Clap your hands and keep in time</i>

104
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,687
<i># Now let's get the rhythm of the hands</i>

105
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,730
<i># Now we've got the rhythm of the hands</i>

106
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,358
<i># Now let's get the rhythm of the feet</i>

107
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:38,519
# Now we've got the rhythm of the feet

108
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,770
<i># Now let's get the rhythm of the eyes</i>

109
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:42,323
# Now we've got the rhythm...

110
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:53,584
Hey, Bean, stick your finger in there and wag it.

111
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:55,625
Go on, stick it in.

112
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,628
Is that how your girlfriend feels?

113
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,635
<i>We do geography at school, Da.</i>

114
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,678
<i>It's my favourite subject.</i>

115
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:52,430
<i>I know every single country in the whole world.</i>

116
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,766
<i>Miss Mackenzie gave me</i>
<i>two gold stars for my homework.</i>

117
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:57,936
Well done!

118
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,625
<i>I've made a friend.</i>

119
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,537
<i>His name's Ricky Monroe.</i>

120
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,954
<i>And he's rubbish at geography.</i>

121
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,521
- Morrison 2642.
- Take a seat.

122
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,549
Thanks.

123
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,817
I wondered when you'd show up.

124
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,695
I've kept you something.

125
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,698
Isn't she a beauty?

126
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:36,993
Mmm.

127
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,750
<i>Dear Frankie,</i>
<i>here's another stamp for your collection.</i>

128
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:53,012
<i>This one's a real beauty. The Queen Mary.</i>

129
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,386
<i>They don't build them like that any more.</i>

130
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,435
<i>When I was your age,</i>
<i>I lived so close to the sea I could taste it.</i>

131
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:04,524
<i>The sharp, salty taste on the inside of my mouth.</i>

132
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,277
<i>And I can taste it now.</i>

133
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,568
<i>That same sharp saltiness.</i>

134
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,613
<i>Up here on the deck.</i>

135
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,782
<i>So we're sailing down towards the Cape now.</i>

136
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,571
<i>The sky here is the most beautiful</i>
<i>shade of blue I've ever seen.</i>

137
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,501
<i>It's like the stone in your Ma's engagement ring.</i>

138
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:25,919
<i>Ask her to show you it,</i>
<i>then you'll know exactly what I mean.</i>

139
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,381
Oh, you got it, then?

140
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,672
I always get it when I go, you know that.

141
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,085
I didnae know you were still going to go.

142
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,171
<i>Now that we're here.</i>

143
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,882
I thought you might have stopped all that.

144
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:39,553
No.

145
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,851
I've no plans to stop any of it.

146
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes, can I help you?

147
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,463
Hello?

148
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,471
Hello! I'm talking to you.

149
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:18,672
Er...

150
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,267
Could you come back here, please?

151
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,808
Excuse me, I'm talking to you!

152
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,391
Excuse me.

153
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,439
Cheeky wee devil, you.

154
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,981
Look, son, I did not come up the Clyde
in a paper boat.

155
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,193
I am well aware that a wee boy your age

156
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,281
should be at school doing sums
at this time of the day.

157
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,944
There's no flies on me, so come on.

158
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:40,700
Let's have a look at the note
from your teacher, shall we?

159
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,124
Oh, I didn't realise.

160
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,247
I'm...

161
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,836
I'm... so... sorry.

162
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,207
I didn't know you were...

163
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:56,679
...deaf.

164
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,763
Oh, never you mind, son.

165
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,843
<i>You... You pick a book.</i>

166
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,763
<i>Pick any book.</i>

167
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:06,847
And if we don't have it here,

168
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,976
then I will move mountains to get it for you.

169
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:29,583
Any cards up there for a locksmith?

170
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:32,079
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.

171
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,498
Ah...

172
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,261
Got them.

173
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:05,077
Is this Frankie Morrison's house?

174
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:38,192
You're weird.

175
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,789
A-C-C-R-A.

176
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:53,082
What's that supposed to mean?

177
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,377
It's the name of his dad's boat.

178
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,758
And it's the capital of Ghana.

179
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,551
Don't tell me, you must be Ricky Monroe?

180
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,634
- Ricky...
- What?

181
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,385
Get your feet off the bed.

182
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,518
Thanks, but no thanks.

183
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,734
The advert won't go in the paper till Friday.

184
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,906
I'm grateful for the offer,
but we might not be here that long.

185
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,901
That's what I said when I first came.

186
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:28,912
It's only a part-time job.
I'm not asking you to sign your life away.

187
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,663
OK, just think about it.

188
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:36,540
<i>She doesn't need to think about it.</i>
<i>She'll take it.</i>

189
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,418
<i>Just tell her what time you want her to start.</i>

190
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,047
OK, then.

191
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,691
<i>We crossed the equator a week ago, Frankie.</i>

192
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,776
<i>Be docking in the Cape soon.</i>

193
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:08,945
<i>And it's really hot on board now.</i>

194
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,739
<i>It's so hot on deck,</i>
<i>you burn your hands on the rail.</i>

195
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,292
<i>Well, I'd better go now, Frankie.</i>

196
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,455
<i>It's my turn on watch.</i>

197
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,917
<i>Now, mind and stick in at school</i>
<i>and be a good boy for your mammy.</i>

198
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,721
<i>Love from your daddy.</i>

199
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:06,836
Hey, Frankie boy, bet you're dead excited
about seeing your da?

200
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,006
Why don't you just lay down and die?

201
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:10,509
Ignore him, Frankie.

202
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,471
Bet you didn't even know his boat was coming!

203
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:14,760
Of course he knew, stupid.

204
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:18,804
And you don't need to shout.
He can see what you're saying... unfortunately.

205
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,020
I bet you all my trump cards
your da doesn't come.

206
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:24,685
If he comes, I'll give you the lot.

207
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,061
If he doesnae come,

208
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:31,199
you have to give me every single one of
your stamps and your knife, to keep for ever.

209
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:33,779
No, Frankie, don't. Don't do it.

210
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,294
<i>Dear Da, sorry I haven't written for a few days.</i>

211
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,460
<i>Things have been very busy here.</i>

212
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,987
<i>I suppose you've been busy too,</i>

213
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,325
<i>now that you've had to change course</i>
<i>and sail back north.</i>

214
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,573
<i>Ricky Monroe told me.</i>

215
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,874
<i>Trust him to put his big feet right in it.</i>

216
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,837
<i>I've told him hundreds and hundreds of times</i>

217
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:28,463
<i>you might not even get shore leave.</i>

218
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,800
<i>But he doesn't know about these things</i>
<i>He's not very clever. And he's a liar.</i>

219
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,591
<i>He said you wouldn't want to come</i>
<i>and see us, even if you could.</i>

220
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:40,220
<i>So, guess what, Da? I've made a bet.</i>

221
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,806
<i>I bet Ricky Monroe you were coming.</i>

222
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,436
<i>Then I said I'd bring you</i>
<i>to the football trials to prove it.</i>

223
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,945
Hey, slowcoach, I'm waiting on those chips.

224
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,078
OK, hold your horses, I'm doing them.

225
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,245
Everything all right?

226
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,789
Yeah, everything's fine. Absolutely fine.

227
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,272
I need the money for the milk.

228
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,895
We owe three weeks
and he'll be here first thing.

229
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:27,654
My purse is on the table,
and don't do that again.

230
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:30,026
- Don't do what?
- Come in here without knocking.

231
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,657
I thought you were Frankie.

232
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:34,030
So? You shouldnae have anything to hide.

233
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:36,912
Shut the door.

234
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,121
I've got something I need to show you.

235
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:01,511
I knew something like this would happen.
I told you, didn't I?

236
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:04,896
What are we going to do?

237
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,146
Move?

238
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:09,769
Lizzie, darling, listen, you cannae keep running.

239
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:12,354
You've got to face this sometime.

240
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:15,900
Tell Frankie the truth. He should know, Lizzie.

241
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,987
<i>He should know what his daddy was.</i>

242
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,907
Then maybe he'd stop wishing for him.

243
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,791
Have you forgotten what it was like?

244
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:28,290
No, I haven't forgotten. But it's over now.
It's over and done with. Davey's dead.

245
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,662
Davey's not dead.

246
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:32,083
I check that paper every week.
I know he's not dead.

247
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,593
<i>He could walk in through that door</i>
<i>any minute now and take what's his.</i>

248
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:36,837
No, he won't walk in.

249
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,090
- How do you know that?
- I just know it.

250
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,802
Lizzie, darling, you're my daughter
and I love you, but you're wrong.

251
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:48,682
You've stopped living your life.
You're the one that's dead.

252
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:52,480
That's not what Frankie needs.

253
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:55,194
He doesnae need lies in a letter.

254
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,449
He needs flesh and blood.

255
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,669
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
<i>- For cigarettes.</i>

256
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:06,307
<i>Hello?</i>

257
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:10,106
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

258
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,389
Go away.

259
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,810
Just go away and leave us alone.

260
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:19,154
For God's sake, just leave us alone.

261
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,005
Do you believe in mermaids?

262
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,051
I do. I think the sea's full of them.

263
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,045
I saw one once, over at Meagle Point.

264
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:47,102
There. What do you think?
Do I look like a mermaid?

265
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,356
Frankie, why don't you ask your mammy?

266
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,483
Ask her if your daddy's going to come.

267
00:25:56,363 --> 00:26:00,111
I know. You want to know,
but you don't want to know.

268
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,824
Tricky.

269
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:05,990
You know what I would do,
if I was in your situation?

270
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,488
I'd look in my mammy's wardrobe.

271
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,833
Whenever there's something
my mammy doesn't want me to see,

272
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,043
she hides it in the back of her wardrobe.

273
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,170
I've found hundreds of things in there.

274
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:18,250
Condoms...

275
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:21,377
...dirty videos, cheap cigarettes.

276
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:26,765
See, I bet your daddy's written
to your mammy and told her he's coming,

277
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,852
but not to tell you because it's a surprise.

278
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,146
Girls love secrets, Frankie.

279
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,272
It'll be in the back of her wardrobe.

280
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,981
Trust me. I know these things.

281
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,667
Wardrobe.

282
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,585
The key's here somewhere.

283
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:12,014
Aw!

284
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:21,602
Perfect.

285
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,376
Look, Frankie, a bride's dress.

286
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:50,133
What are you doing with that?

287
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:52,219
<i>That's mine. Put it down.</i>

288
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:59,143
What else did you touch?

289
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:02,897
What else?

290
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:06,985
What else did you touch?

291
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:24,801
Never go near my things again,
do you hear me?

292
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,630
<i>They're mine.</i>

293
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:29,590
They're nothing to do with you. Nothing.

294
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,059
I'm entitled to some privacy.

295
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,386
I'm allowed one thing of my own. Just one.

296
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,101
One single thing that's mine.

297
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:42,233
I'm here, Frankie.

298
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,112
I'm the one that's here.

299
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:47,191
I'm the one that's still here!

300
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,815
Are you still in a huff with me?

301
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,901
I wish you wouldn't sit there. You'll get a chill.

302
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:33,151
Suit yourself.

303
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:45,043
I need to tell you something important.

304
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:08,187
Of course he wants to see you.

305
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,034
He might not want to see me,
but he'll always want to see you.

306
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,872
You're his boy.

307
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,542
Maybe he just can't, Frankie.

308
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,299
It's been a long time.

309
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,811
Like yourself.

310
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,062
You look like yourself.

311
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,882
Heard from your dad yet, Frankie boy?

312
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,150
Hold on! I wasnae finished with that.

313
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,950
Well, hurry up. I haven't got all night.

314
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,905
Come on, Frankie, you too. Eat.

315
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,707
Where's the bloody fire?

316
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,868
I'm going out, that's all.

317
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:51,759
If the wind changes, your faces'll stay like that.

318
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:58,564
Bacardi and Coke, please.

319
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:13,671
<i>I hope you're not working, sweetheart.</i>

320
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,751
We don't do deals in here.

321
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,486
No. On your bike.

322
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:44,161
# Spiegel Im Spiegel

323
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:27,511
I suppose you're dying to know
what I was doing.

324
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't, but...

325
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,103
...that doesn't mean you have to tell me.

326
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:39,438
I was looking for a man.

327
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,114
<i>A stranger.</i>

328
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,690
No past, no present...

329
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,535
...no future.

330
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,756
I was looking for a man to be Frankie's dad.

331
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:05,968
Just for a day, one single day,
and I was going to pay him to do it.

332
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:47,254
Where the hell have you been?

333
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:51,508
I've been worried sick.

334
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,510
I've been at Marie's.

335
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,476
Everything's all right now.

336
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,966
<i>Pass to me!</i>

337
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,807
<i>Dear Da, in case you're interested,</i>

338
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:35,095
<i>the football trials are on Saturday</i>
<i>at Boundary Park.</i>

339
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:36,770
<i>10:30.</i>

340
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:41,147
<i>Mr Fraser said I could get</i>
<i>into the reserves if I want.</i>

341
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:44,105
<i>But I don't. I'm rubbish at football.</i>

342
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,698
<i>Who cares about a stupid bet anyway?</i>

343
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,861
Yes!

344
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:53,408
Another goal by the master!

345
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,868
<i>I know</i>
<i>you're only three whole days away,</i>

346
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,418
<i>so you might not even get this letter.</i>

347
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:08,466
<i>If you can't come and see me,</i>
<i>that's all right, I understand.</i>

348
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,218
<i>Ma says it's been a long time</i>
<i>and you've probably changed.</i>

349
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:14,798
<i>I have, that's for sure.</i>

350
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,680
<i>I'm now four foot eight inches tall,</i>

351
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:20,641
<i>and I have brownish hair, just like Ma's.</i>

352
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,152
<i>Do you know something funny, Da?</i>

353
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,196
<i>I think Ma knew you'd be coming.</i>

354
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,026
<i>That's why she brought us here.</i>

355
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:33,324
<i>I think she wanted you to find us.</i>

356
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,064
Lizzie Morrison?

357
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:06,476
Yeah.

358
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,982
An Americano. Strong.

359
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:19,489
- Just water.
- Sparkling or still?

360
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:20,448
Tap.

361
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,292
Don't get service like this at Marie's.

362
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:42,179
Marie didn't tell me much about you.

363
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,059
No past, present or future.
That's what you said you wanted.

364
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,487
Frankie's letters to his dad.

365
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,951
He's been writing them for a few years now.

366
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,534
He's a lovely wee writer.

367
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,582
Well, you'll see that for yourself.

368
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,124
He sends them to a post office box
here in Glasgow,

369
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:09,835
and I collect them twice a month
and then I write back.

370
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,922
Um, this is one of mine.

371
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,890
That's a Scottish postmark.

372
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,517
Yeah, I've told him there's a central mail depot,

373
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:28,228
and that all the letters from the ship go there.

374
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:29,646
He doesnae question it.

375
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:45,082
I make it all up. I've been making it up for years.

376
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,077
I made up the boat.

377
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,830
I saw the name on a stamp.

378
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,674
How was I to know
the bloody boat actually existed?

379
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,555
That's Frankie,

380
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,734
a couple of months before his dad left.

381
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:14,979
And this is him now.

382
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,905
Frankie's deaf, but he's a champion lip-reader.

383
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,248
How old is he?

384
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,365
Nine.

385
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,575
And a half.

386
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,546
Does he remember what his dad looks like?

387
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:35,004
I don't remember what he looks like.
It's been a while.

388
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:41,174
Does Frankie have any photographs
of his dad?

389
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,057
No.

390
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:44,174
You sure?

391
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,261
Yes, I'm sure.

392
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:55,146
Marie says you're only here for a week.

393
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:56,436
I sail next Monday.

394
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:59,940
Good, that's good. That fits in just right.

395
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,237
Um...

396
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:08,866
That must be some life,
seeing all those different places.

397
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,754
You should know.

398
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,330
You've been writing from them for years.

399
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:22,763
You must think I'm completely mad,
asking a total stranger to do this.

400
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:26,556
I don't know who the hell you are, but...

401
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,854
...I'm asking you if you'll do it.

402
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:35,776
I don't have much, but I'll pay you what I can.

403
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,302
What time do you want me to be there?

404
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:17,442
One day to go, Frankie boy.

405
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,319
<i># The midges, I'm no gonna kid yous</i>

406
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:24,112
# The midges is really the limit

407
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,989
# With teeth like piranhas

408
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,536
<i># They'll drive you bananas</i>

409
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:34,001
# If you let them get under your...

410
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:35,914
# Simmit

411
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:42,166
Hey, come on, you sing one now.

412
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:44,301
Oh, God, no, I can't sing.

413
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,504
<i>Oh, go on.</i>

414
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:47,556
# Da dum da-da dum...

415
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:51,180
Come on, you know it better than me.

416
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:54,355
# When I was a young girl

417
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:58,059
# I used to dream of a lover

418
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:04,865
<i># Who'd be my shining knight</i>
<i>of strength one day</i>

419
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:10,906
# He'd carry me to a castle in the heavens

420
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:16,871
<i># And he'd battle all my dragons far away</i>

421
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,626
<i># And he'd ride down</i>

422
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:23,290
# On a great white horse

423
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,890
# And he'd bring me love

424
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:30,389
# I'd been longing for

425
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:33,347
# And he'd bring me joy

426
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:37,056
<i># And lasting peace</i>

427
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,606
<i># And on a great white horse</i>

428
00:44:40,362 --> 00:44:42,853
<i># He'd ride away with me</i>

429
00:44:54,584 --> 00:44:58,416
Lizzie. For God's sake,
will you stop still for a minute and listen?

430
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:01,126
I can't, I've got to find him.
God knows where he is.

431
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:03,173
Well, I'll go. I'll find him.

432
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:05,217
He's due at ten, isn't he?

433
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,011
- The man?
- Yeah.

434
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:09,848
- Well, you'd better stay here in case.
- In case of what?

435
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:11,308
Just in case.

436
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:13,765
I'll find him. I promise.

437
00:45:30,912 --> 00:45:33,949
I look at you sometimes and I swear
I don't know where you came from.

438
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:39,168
And this man?

439
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:45,256
<i>- Who is this man that's coming?</i>
<i>- I told you. He's a friend of Marie's.</i>

440
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,921
Oh, that's a comfort!

441
00:45:48,471 --> 00:45:52,303
Jesus, Lizzie, we don't know anything
about this man.

442
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,011
He could be a...

443
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:58,262
<i>We don't know anything about him.</i>

444
00:45:59,399 --> 00:46:01,557
We don't need to know anything.

445
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,977
- This is the end of it.
- Promise?

446
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:07,985
That's him.

447
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,624
Hey, Frankie.

448
00:46:20,587 --> 00:46:22,544
Your mammy is worried about you.

449
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:33,215
It's good up here, isn't it?

450
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,518
This is my favourite place in the whole world.

451
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:46,438
See, when you come around the coner,

452
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:49,234
and the cranes appear out of nowhere...

453
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,988
<i>With the hills behind them</i>

454
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:56,743
<i>and the water dancing round them.</i>

455
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:59,825
Takes my breath away.

456
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,546
Every single time.

457
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:40,407
Right, if he's not back in five minutes,
I'm going to the docks myself.

458
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,786
How do you even know that's where he is?

459
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:45,421
Where would you go if it was you?

460
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:47,213
He won't go on that ship.

461
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:51,591
How do you know what he would do?
You've not even met him.

462
00:47:51,678 --> 00:47:53,671
He doesn't want to spoil the surprise.

463
00:47:56,683 --> 00:47:58,011
If I was a betting man,

464
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:01,095
which I'm not,

465
00:48:01,187 --> 00:48:02,931
I'd put money on it.

466
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:16,784
Mother, do something useful
and put the kettle on.

467
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,533
Would you like a cup of tea?

468
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:27,209
- I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Jesus God!

469
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,167
What's Frankie's dad called?

470
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,668
Depends who's calling him.

471
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:39,802
Davey.

472
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:41,885
Call me Davey, then.

473
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,103
Don't ruin this for him, please.
Let him have this one day.

474
00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:56,897
Have you got that money?

475
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,950
Oh, yeah, um...

476
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,040
That's half now, half later.

477
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,290
<i>Look, there's no harm done.</i>

478
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,959
<i>He knows he shouldn't have done it.</i>

479
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:15,215
So, um... everything all right?

480
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:17,462
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Good</i>

481
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,180
Right, I'd better go.

482
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:21,935
Hey, come in for chips after the football, OK?

483
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,139
Marie...

484
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,853
Thanks for bringing him.

485
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:32,224
Right.

486
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:38,820
<i>No, leave that, Frankie. Do it later.</i>

487
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:40,991
<i>I want you to come in here for a minute.</i>

488
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:44,996
You've got a visitor, Frankie.

489
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:49,081
This is your daddy.

490
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:01,305
Hello, Frankie.

491
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:07,145
You've got big.

492
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,522
I didn't tell you I was coming because...

493
00:50:13,612 --> 00:50:15,569
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd be here in time.</i>

494
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:18,325
<i>I hoped I would, but I wasn't sure.</i>

495
00:50:20,368 --> 00:50:22,277
I've got something for you.

496
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:26,581
Frankie wasnae looking for anything.
You didn't need to do that.

497
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,623
I know I didn't need to.

498
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,958
That's for you.

499
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,813
He wants to know how you knew.

500
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:58,779
I read it.

501
00:50:58,865 --> 00:51:01,486
You... You'll have to look at him.

502
00:51:03,536 --> 00:51:04,781
<i>Sorry</i>

503
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:07,196
I read it in your letters.

504
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:38,686
You'll have to get a move on, you'll be late.

505
00:51:44,744 --> 00:51:47,366
Come on, slowcoach. Get your things together.

506
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:48,451
Here.

507
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:55,085
You'll want to remember the look
on Ricky Monroe's face.

508
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:01,292
<i>Come on, now, boys, that's good.</i>

509
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:03,592
<i>Keep moving</i>

510
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,055
<i>Well done.</i>

511
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,559
Come on.

512
00:52:10,186 --> 00:52:12,677
<i>- What are you doing, you bloody idiot?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

513
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:16,521
- You gave me a crap pass.
- I didn't mean to. I slipped.

514
00:52:28,705 --> 00:52:30,662
Well, a bet's a bet.

515
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:32,706
You won it fair and square.

516
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:43,006
Do you want to bring him for chips?

517
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,595
No? Another time maybe?

518
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:27,506
Come on, Frankie.

519
00:53:27,597 --> 00:53:31,013
This is half an hour of my life
I am never going to get back.

520
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:33,140
Just have what you always have.

521
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:34,639
Chips.

522
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:43,062
<i>Me too.</i>

523
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,112
Can I have some fish with mine?

524
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,443
Er... Frankie is a vegetarian.

525
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:54,914
He's a vegetarian
that doesnae eat his vegetables.

526
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:58,252
Roll and butter?

527
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:04,960
Can I change my mind?

528
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:06,840
Sure.

529
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:09,217
No fish for me.

530
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:13,266
Right, is that it?

531
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:34,030
I know, Frankie.

532
00:54:46,426 --> 00:54:48,253
Good? Yeah? Yeah?

533
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,965
It's going well.

534
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,767
Is it?

535
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:57,223
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

536
00:54:57,312 --> 00:54:59,269
I thought this is what you wanted.

537
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,647
Yeah, it is.

538
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:08,811
He's not going to take him away from you,
Lizzie.

539
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:13,202
Nobody could do that.

540
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:17,915
Where are they going now?

541
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,626
He wouldn't take him to the ship?

542
00:55:24,297 --> 00:55:26,456
Lizzie, wait! Wait.

543
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:28,293
Lizzie!

544
00:56:04,296 --> 00:56:06,703
Big, isn't she?

545
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,467
More than a match for any shark.

546
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,428
Want to go on?

547
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,443
It's up to you, Frankie.

548
00:56:35,368 --> 00:56:36,946
Take a picture, then.

549
00:56:37,037 --> 00:56:38,116
For later.

550
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,750
# Delicate

551
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:10,776
# We might kiss

552
00:57:14,824 --> 00:57:16,782
# When we are alone

553
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:23,532
# When nobody's watching...

554
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,828
Too bumpy. Flat, so it skims.

555
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,011
# We might make out

556
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,472
# When nobody's there

557
00:57:46,273 --> 00:57:48,230
# It's not that we're scared...

558
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:51,937
This is good, Frankie.

559
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:55,406
Frankie...

560
00:57:56,116 --> 00:58:02,154
# So why do you fill my sorrow?

561
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:05,620
That is a champion skimmer.

562
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:16,792
# From the only place that you've known

563
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:27,101
# And why do you sing hallelujah

564
00:58:27,188 --> 00:58:32,859
# If it means nothing to ya?

565
00:58:33,528 --> 00:58:34,987
# Why do you sing...

566
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,863
Want to go for a race?

567
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:42,488
# With me at all?

568
00:58:45,874 --> 00:58:50,417
# Why did you fill my sorrow

569
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:57,633
# With the words you've borrowed?

570
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:06,393
# Why do you sing with me at all?

571
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:38,544
You OK?

572
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:54,353
I've had an idea.

573
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:11,118
Oh!

574
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:16,120
- Have you not got a watch?
- Sorry. The time just flew.

575
01:00:24,514 --> 01:00:26,471
Now, Frankie, say goodbye.

576
01:00:27,726 --> 01:00:29,101
He's tired.

577
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:31,178
It's been a long day.

578
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:34,438
Aye, you can say that again.
Well, it's over now.

579
01:00:34,524 --> 01:00:37,560
So, we'll just say cheerio,
and thanks very much.

580
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:41,486
Go on, Frankie, say cheerio.

581
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:45,321
Come on. It's late.

582
01:00:54,419 --> 01:00:56,459
I think he wants to ask you something.

583
01:00:59,758 --> 01:01:01,667
What do you think he wants to ask me?

584
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:05,253
I don't go back to my ship till Monday.

585
01:01:05,347 --> 01:01:06,509
So?

586
01:01:06,598 --> 01:01:10,430
So, I thought it might be nice to...
spend some more time with Frankie.

587
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:15,981
Did you, now?

588
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,278
Well, Frankie and you.
You know, the three of us.

589
01:01:23,907 --> 01:01:24,653
No.

590
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,898
No!

591
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,321
Now see what you've done.

592
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:40,462
Mother, take Frankie inside now.

593
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,808
We had an arrangement. You broke it.

594
01:01:51,893 --> 01:01:54,052
One more day. That's all.

595
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:56,055
No, no, no, I want you to go now.

596
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:58,105
It's over. Do you hear me? It's over.

597
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:00,314
My ship sails in one day.

598
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:01,777
There is only one more day.

599
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:03,819
Who the hell do you think you are?

600
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:09,484
Who gave you the right
to come in here and behave like this?

601
01:02:10,578 --> 01:02:12,203
You did.

602
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:16,490
He's waited all this time.

603
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:19,621
<i>You've waited all this time.</i>

604
01:02:35,979 --> 01:02:37,770
One o'clock, here.

605
01:02:37,856 --> 01:02:39,647
One o'clock down at the quay.

606
01:02:39,733 --> 01:02:44,276
- Right, that's it. Come on.
- I've got business down at the quay.

607
01:02:46,406 --> 01:02:49,442
Be easier if you could meet me there.
Trust me.

608
01:02:52,454 --> 01:02:55,371
You have to trust somebody someday.

609
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:05,964
One o'clock at the quay.

610
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:09,887
Come on, son.

611
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:11,928
You'll see him again tomorrow.

612
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:03,809
Did your daddy give you that?

613
01:04:13,493 --> 01:04:15,153
It's a beauty.

614
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:17,329
That should really fly.

615
01:04:34,097 --> 01:04:35,675
<i>Is Frankie sleeping?</i>

616
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:38,435
I doubt it. He's wound up like a spring.

617
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:41,643
Do you fancy a wee whisky, Ma?

618
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,521
Why? What are we celebrating?

619
01:04:43,607 --> 01:04:47,141
We're not celebrating anything.
I just need one, that's all.

620
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:11,424
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

621
01:05:18,475 --> 01:05:20,135
<i>Here. Give me that.</i>

622
01:05:28,276 --> 01:05:31,396
Bette Davis used to have blood-red nails.

623
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:33,445
- Did she?
- Mm.

624
01:05:34,658 --> 01:05:36,899
That's what your daddy used to call you.

625
01:05:38,703 --> 01:05:42,535
You'd be all dressed up
in my best frock and high heels.

626
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:45,293
Talking away to yourself.

627
01:05:45,377 --> 01:05:47,286
Away in your own wee world.

628
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,041
And he'd say,

629
01:05:50,131 --> 01:05:54,461
"Jesus Christ, Nell!
Who the hell does that lassie think she is?

630
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:55,928
Bette Davis?"

631
01:05:58,306 --> 01:06:00,263
I never really liked Bette Davis.

632
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:03,763
Preferred Barbara Stanwyck.

633
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:10,899
You knew where you were
with Barbara Stanwyck.

634
01:06:15,198 --> 01:06:16,229
Ma...

635
01:06:16,324 --> 01:06:18,447
What is it?

636
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:23,413
My brush. Have you seen my brush?

637
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:25,455
- In your bag.
- Oh, aye.

638
01:06:28,378 --> 01:06:31,498
Oh, I forgot to give you this.
It's been in my bag for ages.

639
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:46,468
You know something? I don't think
I'll bother getting this paper any more.

640
01:06:46,563 --> 01:06:48,935
Never anything in it.

641
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:51,519
Let me see it.

642
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,805
Aye. Aye, you can come right over.

643
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:29,853
Come round later.

644
01:07:33,944 --> 01:07:36,020
Maybe we can get a video or something.

645
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,372
Janet wants to meet me.

646
01:07:46,456 --> 01:07:47,619
Is he dead?

647
01:07:47,707 --> 01:07:49,201
He's very ill, apparently.

648
01:07:49,292 --> 01:07:50,407
It's a trap.

649
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:52,411
He wants to see Frankie.

650
01:07:52,504 --> 01:07:55,125
We can leave. Go tonight.

651
01:07:55,215 --> 01:07:57,884
You don't owe him anything.

652
01:07:57,968 --> 01:08:01,965
I know I shouldn't ask,
but he's my brother, Lizzie.

653
01:08:02,055 --> 01:08:03,383
He's my brother.

654
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:05,679
He's a sorry sight, Lizzie.

655
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:08,638
He's not the man he was. That's a dead cert.

656
01:08:08,728 --> 01:08:10,306
If you could only just see him.

657
01:08:10,397 --> 01:08:12,270
No.

658
01:08:12,357 --> 01:08:14,848
Please. Put the past behind you,
for Frankie's sake.

659
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:18,276
- Leave Frankie out of it.
- He's dying, Lizzie.

660
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,987
How long has he got?

661
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:25,826
They don't know. It just depends
how much fight there is in him.

662
01:08:25,912 --> 01:08:27,406
He always had plenty of that.

663
01:08:27,497 --> 01:08:29,620
What good does that do now?

664
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,700
I don't have to justify myself to you.

665
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:32,789
<i>Or him.</i>

666
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:35,036
I don't blame you. I've never blamed you.

667
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,455
<i>He's my brother. I know exactly what he is.</i>

668
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:41,585
But you know what they say.

669
01:08:41,678 --> 01:08:43,256
No, Janet, what do they say?

670
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:45,339
They say blood's thicker than water, Lizzie,

671
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:48,183
and, like it or not,
he's Frankie's flesh and blood.

672
01:08:50,562 --> 01:08:52,969
- I'll see him on my own.
- He wants to see Frankie.

673
01:08:53,064 --> 01:08:56,231
For God's sake, he might not last. Please.

674
01:08:56,318 --> 01:08:58,227
I'm begging you. Show some pity.

675
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,938
I'll see him on my own,
and then I'll decide if I let him near my son.

676
01:09:03,241 --> 01:09:05,483
That's it, Janet. Take it or leave it.

677
01:09:46,993 --> 01:09:47,942
Ready?

678
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,461
Cheers, pal.

679
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:42,124
Here.

680
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:03,017
Right, you choose.

681
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:05,732
Where do you want to go?

682
01:11:07,574 --> 01:11:09,531
# The Secret Sun

683
01:11:19,961 --> 01:11:24,089
# Meet me by the sea again

684
01:11:25,592 --> 01:11:29,886
# Past the point where the shoreline bends

685
01:11:31,222 --> 01:11:35,054
# Where the sand is soft and warm

686
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:41,608
# And hangs upon your golden arm

687
01:11:43,401 --> 01:11:50,483
# And time won't move at all

688
01:11:55,872 --> 01:11:59,822
# We were once the only ones

689
01:12:01,586 --> 01:12:05,251
# Who knew of the secret sun

690
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,428
# Shining down where no-one goes

691
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:17,048
# In a place that no-one knows...

692
01:12:19,354 --> 01:12:21,145
I think this must be yours, sir.

693
01:12:22,357 --> 01:12:24,848
Stupid me. It's for you, isn't it?

694
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:32,449
Your dad thought
all his birthdays had come at once.

695
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:37,620
Could you bring another spoon,

696
01:12:37,706 --> 01:12:39,663
just in case he cannae finish it?

697
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:53,636
Hold it flat, Frankie!

698
01:12:58,643 --> 01:13:00,102
<i>He cannae hear you.</i>

699
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,313
Sorry.

700
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,978
I forgot.

701
01:13:09,154 --> 01:13:13,365
# But back there in the orange light

702
01:13:14,284 --> 01:13:19,160
# There will be no fear of the night

703
01:13:20,915 --> 01:13:29,457
# And time won't move at all

704
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:37,633
# And time won't move

705
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:44,803
# At all

706
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,354
<i>Hi, Frankie!</i>

707
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:34,519
You well?

708
01:14:34,614 --> 01:14:36,571
Oh, no, thanks!

709
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:39,483
Hello.

710
01:14:39,577 --> 01:14:40,740
Hiya.

711
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:43,865
- You look nice.
- So do you.

712
01:14:47,252 --> 01:14:50,288
Oh, this is Ally, er... my partner.

713
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,578
In crime.

714
01:14:52,757 --> 01:14:53,706
Hi.

715
01:14:56,344 --> 01:14:58,752
I thought you only had the one day.

716
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:00,175
I did.

717
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:03,469
This is the second half of it.

718
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,683
Aye, Frankie must be delighted.

719
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:09,766
So, what are you all up to now?

720
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:12,100
Going home.
Frankie's got school in the morning.

721
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:19,731
Why don't you stay?

722
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:21,237
I mean, just for a wee while.

723
01:15:21,328 --> 01:15:22,703
<i>I mean, he'd love it.</i>

724
01:15:22,787 --> 01:15:26,832
Right, the DJ is rank,
but there's a great band on afterwards.

725
01:15:28,168 --> 01:15:30,789
No, sweetheart, it's been a long day.

726
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:33,251
<i>And it's time to go now.</i>

727
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,131
Come on, son.

728
01:15:35,216 --> 01:15:36,960
It's just this once.

729
01:15:41,556 --> 01:15:43,596
# Macarena

730
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:45,972
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

731
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:48,634
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
alegria y cosa buena

732
01:15:48,772 --> 01:15:50,729
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

733
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:52,274
# Hey, Macarena!

734
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,317
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

735
01:15:55,403 --> 01:15:57,811
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
alegria y cosa buena

736
01:15:57,906 --> 01:16:00,112
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

737
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,442
# Hey, Macarena!

738
01:16:02,535 --> 01:16:04,445
# Macarena tiene un novio
que se llama

739
01:16:07,374 --> 01:16:09,200
# Y en la jura de bandera
del muchacho

740
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:10,786
# Se la dio con dos amigos

741
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:13,795
# Macarana tiene un novio
que se llama

742
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,205
# Que se llama de apellido Vitorino

743
01:16:16,299 --> 01:16:18,173
# Y en la jura de bandera
del muchacho

744
01:16:18,259 --> 01:16:20,169
# Se la dio con dos amigos

745
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:23,547
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena...

746
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,134
So? What do you think, then?

747
01:16:25,225 --> 01:16:27,977
I don't think anything. Why?

748
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:29,639
Nothing.

749
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:31,473
I was just wondering, that's all.

750
01:16:32,565 --> 01:16:36,433
There's nothing to wonder.
It's a business arrangement, that's all.

751
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,779
And his ship sails tomorrow, like he said.

752
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:46,447
Like he said.

753
01:16:58,925 --> 01:17:00,882
Good God.

754
01:17:00,969 --> 01:17:02,214
I can't drink all that.

755
01:17:02,304 --> 01:17:05,340
No, but I know a man who can.

756
01:17:12,731 --> 01:17:14,225
Cheers.

757
01:17:16,985 --> 01:17:19,476
Since when did you start smoking those?

758
01:17:19,571 --> 01:17:21,148
What happened to your roll-ups?

759
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,452
Oh, Jesus. Make my next one a double.

760
01:17:34,002 --> 01:17:36,707
# When I was a young man

761
01:17:36,796 --> 01:17:39,122
# I used to dream of a maiden...

762
01:17:40,925 --> 01:17:42,170
That's my song.

763
01:17:42,302 --> 01:17:44,674
# With long soft hair

764
01:17:45,805 --> 01:17:48,427
# Blowing in the wind

765
01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:56,768
# Her laughing eyes
and loving arms would follow

766
01:17:59,444 --> 01:18:01,437
# When I'd sail around the world...

767
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:03,902
Hey, Frankie. Hey, Frankie.

768
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:09,329
I bet you all your trump cards
that you don't ask Catriona Murray to dance.

769
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,496
# I'd ride down on a great white horse...

770
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:18,919
If you do that, I'll get your mum up to dance.

771
01:18:20,256 --> 01:18:21,799
Deal?

772
01:18:23,551 --> 01:18:26,303
# I'd bring her laughter...

773
01:18:26,388 --> 01:18:27,633
Dance?

774
01:18:27,722 --> 01:18:30,178
# On a rainy day...

775
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:32,224
I never dance.

776
01:18:33,353 --> 01:18:36,804
You'll have to this once.
Frankie's made another bet.

777
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:41,769
You'd better watch him.
It's becoming a bit of a habit.

778
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:55,494
# When I was a young girl,
I used to dream of a lover

779
01:18:58,878 --> 01:19:05,332
# Who'd be my shining knight
of strength one day

780
01:19:06,886 --> 01:19:12,129
# He'd take me to a castle in the heavens

781
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:21,807
# And battle all my dragons on the way

782
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:29,866
# And he'd ride down on a great white horse

783
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:34,743
# He'd give me love

784
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:38,282
# I'd been longing for

785
01:19:39,294 --> 01:19:43,244
# He'd bring me joy

786
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:47,551
# And lasting peace

787
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:51,680
# And on a great white horse

788
01:19:51,765 --> 01:19:54,635
# He'd ride away with me...

789
01:20:15,538 --> 01:20:19,073
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

790
01:20:19,376 --> 01:20:23,041
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

791
01:20:24,547 --> 01:20:26,505
I had a good time tonight.

792
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:31,676
Don't sound so surprised.

793
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:37,011
You are the best!

794
01:20:37,102 --> 01:20:39,059
He's got your eyes.

795
01:20:42,357 --> 01:20:43,935
They pull you.

796
01:20:44,985 --> 01:20:46,230
Right in.

797
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:49,273
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

798
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:51,321
I don't know what to say to that.

799
01:20:52,575 --> 01:20:54,615
Well, you don't have to say anything.

800
01:20:59,124 --> 01:21:00,867
You don't have to say nice things to me.

801
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,916
I'm not paying you for that.

802
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,337
So, why don't you want to hear them?

803
01:21:10,385 --> 01:21:12,342
What are you afraid of?

804
01:21:15,765 --> 01:21:17,722
Where did Marie find you?

805
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:21,477
No.

806
01:21:22,522 --> 01:21:24,479
I thought we agreed: No history.

807
01:21:31,948 --> 01:21:33,905
Things have changed.

808
01:21:37,787 --> 01:21:39,330
Have they?

809
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,337
What I find really difficult...

810
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:51,798
to understand...

811
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,553
is why?

812
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,966
I told you why. Frankie made a bet.

813
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:01,597
No, no, no, no, no.

814
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:06,147
Why did he ever leave the two of you?

815
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:14,731
He didn't leave us. I left him.

816
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:21,487
One night I just picked Frankie up, and I left.

817
01:22:21,581 --> 01:22:24,748
And my mother came with me,
to make sure I never went back.

818
01:22:28,463 --> 01:22:30,337
And we've been leaving ever since.

819
01:22:30,423 --> 01:22:33,460
<i>Always ready in case he shows up.</i>

820
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,384
Frankie wasn't born deaf.
It was a present from his daddy.

821
01:23:12,507 --> 01:23:16,125
Frankie's a very... very lucky boy.

822
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:22,046
How do you figure that one out?

823
01:23:22,142 --> 01:23:24,929
I'm his mother, and I lie to him every single day.

824
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,597
No.

825
01:23:28,315 --> 01:23:30,307
No, you protect him every single day.

826
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:36,901
Do I?

827
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:50,044
Every time I write one of those letters
I promise myself it'll be the last one.

828
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,453
<i>I thought he'd lose interest, in time.</i>

829
01:23:55,592 --> 01:23:57,134
<i>Just stop</i>

830
01:24:00,096 --> 01:24:02,422
But see, if he hasn't written
for a couple of weeks,

831
01:24:02,515 --> 01:24:05,801
I'm the one egging him on,
telling him to hurry up and write.

832
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:10,770
<i>It's the only way I can hear his voice.</i>

833
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,690
<i>I'd better go.</i>

834
01:25:01,408 --> 01:25:02,902
I'm away first thing.

835
01:25:07,205 --> 01:25:08,865
Can I say goodbye?

836
01:25:08,957 --> 01:25:10,617
If you can wake him.

837
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,459
Hey.

838
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:58,953
You're coming back?

839
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:06,552
I don't know, Frankie.

840
01:26:35,126 --> 01:26:36,241
Did you do this?

841
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:44,004
Frankie, I can't take this. This... This is yours.

842
01:26:52,811 --> 01:26:54,768
I'd be honoured to take it.

843
01:26:57,315 --> 01:26:59,107
It's beautiful.

844
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,077
Remember, Frankie.

845
01:27:13,456 --> 01:27:15,414
We're all connected.

846
01:30:35,742 --> 01:30:37,699
Lizzie, Lizzie.

847
01:30:47,128 --> 01:30:48,836
I've let myself go a wee bit. Sorry.

848
01:30:54,094 --> 01:30:56,003
It's been a long time.

849
01:31:01,184 --> 01:31:02,844
You're still beautiful.

850
01:31:04,062 --> 01:31:06,553
No, I'm not. I'm not beautiful.

851
01:31:07,649 --> 01:31:09,440
I'm sorry.

852
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:14,688
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

853
01:31:15,782 --> 01:31:17,490
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

854
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:19,734
Shush, Davey. Shush.

855
01:31:21,746 --> 01:31:24,581
It's all right. It's all right now.

856
01:31:26,293 --> 01:31:27,751
Don't cry.

857
01:31:33,758 --> 01:31:35,253
Where's Frankie?

858
01:31:35,343 --> 01:31:37,419
<i>He's at school.</i>

859
01:31:37,512 --> 01:31:40,383
He's nine now, nearly ten.

860
01:31:40,473 --> 01:31:42,051
Aye, I know.

861
01:31:44,853 --> 01:31:46,976
He's top at geography.

862
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,397
I always knew he was clever.

863
01:31:53,194 --> 01:31:54,902
Must take that off you.

864
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:58,855
I don't think so. You were the one
that could have gone to college.

865
01:32:32,901 --> 01:32:35,226
I want to see him, Lizzie.

866
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,562
I've got a right to see him.

867
01:32:37,656 --> 01:32:39,862
<i>- Don't give me that.</i>
<i>- It's too late for fighting.</i>

868
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,741
<i>Just let me see him.</i>

869
01:32:43,787 --> 01:32:45,744
I want him to know how sorry I am.

870
01:32:48,124 --> 01:32:49,583
He's my son.

871
01:32:49,668 --> 01:32:51,625
He's not your son. He's mine.

872
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,205
You don't deserve him.

873
01:32:56,299 --> 01:32:59,134
You don't deserve his forgiveness.

874
01:33:01,721 --> 01:33:03,299
Christ.

875
01:33:05,809 --> 01:33:07,766
I made one mistake.

876
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:12,771
One stupid fucking mistake,
and you made me pay.

877
01:33:12,857 --> 01:33:15,230
<i>You've made me pay, all right.</i>

878
01:33:16,403 --> 01:33:18,395
You're a bitch.

879
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:22,573
<i>You're nothing but a bitch!</i>

880
01:33:24,077 --> 01:33:25,357
I want to see my son!

881
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:29,415
<i>I've got a right!</i>

882
01:33:29,499 --> 01:33:31,077
I'm his father!

883
01:33:31,167 --> 01:33:32,827
<i>I've got rights!</i>

884
01:33:32,919 --> 01:33:35,873
I've got my rights! I'm his father!

885
01:33:35,964 --> 01:33:37,541
You're not his father!

886
01:33:37,632 --> 01:33:40,882
He's got a different father now, a real father.

887
01:33:40,969 --> 01:33:45,880
A kind, gentle man, who teaches him
to throw stones across the water.

888
01:33:45,974 --> 01:33:47,801
You could never be his father.

889
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:49,850
I want to see my son!

890
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:52,261
<i>- Davey, please, no, come on.</i>
<i>- I'm his father!</i>

891
01:33:52,355 --> 01:33:53,470
Davey, no, stop it.

892
01:33:53,565 --> 01:33:54,845
Nurse!

893
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:56,934
<i>Nurse!</i>

894
01:33:57,068 --> 01:33:58,942
I want to see my son!

895
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,458
Lizzie, wait a minute.

896
01:34:16,379 --> 01:34:19,380
Lizzie, Lizzie, please.

897
01:34:19,466 --> 01:34:21,873
He nearly killed us, Janet!

898
01:34:21,968 --> 01:34:24,044
I know. I know.

899
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:27,094
He's only got a few days left.

900
01:34:27,182 --> 01:34:29,091
He can't touch you now.

901
01:34:29,976 --> 01:34:31,885
Let him die in peace.

902
01:34:32,687 --> 01:34:34,644
For your own sake.

903
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:11,763
I want to talk to you. It's very important.

904
01:35:13,937 --> 01:35:15,894
I got a message today from your dad.

905
01:35:19,192 --> 01:35:21,564
He's not very well, Frankie.

906
01:35:21,653 --> 01:35:23,195
He's very, very sick.

907
01:35:25,949 --> 01:35:28,404
But he says he wants you to know he loves you.

908
01:35:30,495 --> 01:35:31,658
Very much.

909
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:07,863
<i>Dear Da, I thought you'd like this drawing.</i>

910
01:36:07,949 --> 01:36:10,274
<i>I copied it from my book.</i>

911
01:36:10,368 --> 01:36:12,776
<i>Ma says you're not very well.</i>

912
01:36:12,871 --> 01:36:15,160
<i>I hope you feel better soon.</i>

913
01:36:15,248 --> 01:36:17,205
<i>Love from your son, Frankie.</i>

914
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:51,364
<i>OK, call the crash team.</i>

915
01:36:54,287 --> 01:36:56,778
Please! What is wrong with him?

916
01:36:56,873 --> 01:36:58,996
Let's get the bed down. Come on.

917
01:37:00,085 --> 01:37:02,042
Mrs Morrison?

918
01:37:02,128 --> 01:37:05,711
It might be best if you went
and had a cup of tea just now.

919
01:37:05,799 --> 01:37:09,250
I'll send someone along to find you
as soon as we have any news.

920
01:37:10,345 --> 01:37:12,302
This is for my husband.

921
01:37:13,556 --> 01:37:14,932
It's from our son.

922
01:37:15,016 --> 01:37:16,594
Right.

923
01:37:21,314 --> 01:37:23,106
- Oh, Nurse, erm...
- Yes?

924
01:37:27,612 --> 01:37:29,106
Could you make sure he sees it?

925
01:37:29,197 --> 01:37:30,857
I'll make sure.

926
01:37:40,959 --> 01:37:44,624
<i>Davey Morrison</i>
<i>died peacefully after a long illness.</i>

927
01:37:44,713 --> 01:37:46,705
<i>Father to Frankie.</i>

928
01:38:19,331 --> 01:38:23,494
I know it's a terrible thing to say,
but Davey's finally done you a favour.

929
01:38:23,585 --> 01:38:25,328
It's over now.

930
01:38:29,174 --> 01:38:30,419
Marie?

931
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:31,789
What?

932
01:38:32,844 --> 01:38:34,635
Who was he?

933
01:38:36,014 --> 01:38:37,757
My brother.

934
01:38:40,727 --> 01:38:42,470
Oh, right.

935
01:38:45,607 --> 01:38:47,564
I've got to go.

936
01:38:50,195 --> 01:38:52,520
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you after.

937
01:38:56,952 --> 01:38:58,612
<i>Do you want me to check the box?</i>

938
01:38:58,703 --> 01:39:00,660
<i>There won't be anything in it.</i>

939
01:39:00,747 --> 01:39:03,320
<i>It'll cost you to have your mail forwarded.</i>

940
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:06,121
I'll check it for you, hen,
just to be on the safe side.

941
01:39:54,426 --> 01:39:56,881
<i>Thanks for the book.</i>

942
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,924
<i>I've read it all the way through now twice.</i>

943
01:40:01,933 --> 01:40:03,677
<i>I took it into school.</i>

944
01:40:03,768 --> 01:40:05,346
<i>I know you won't mind.</i>

945
01:40:05,437 --> 01:40:07,476
<i>My teacher put it on the nature table.</i>

946
01:40:22,037 --> 01:40:24,610
<i>Miss Mackenzie gave me a gold star.</i>

947
01:40:24,706 --> 01:40:27,873
<i>I've got eight now. Catriona's got 20.</i>

948
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:31,293
<i>Ricky's only got one, and it's not even gold.</i>

949
01:40:38,678 --> 01:40:39,841
<i>Guess what.</i>

950
01:40:39,929 --> 01:40:41,803
<i>I got into the football team.</i>

951
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:44,974
<i>Well, the reserves. I'm playing on Saturday.</i>

952
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,551
<i>And guess what else.</i>

953
01:40:47,646 --> 01:40:49,804
<i>I got one wrong in geography this week.</i>

954
01:40:53,944 --> 01:40:55,936
<i>Ma and I had a bit of a shock last week.</i>

955
01:40:57,113 --> 01:41:00,945
<i>My da - my real da - he's been sick.</i>

956
01:41:02,118 --> 01:41:04,574
<i>I think he's been sick for a long time.</i>

957
01:41:04,663 --> 01:41:06,323
<i>Ma never said anything.</i>

958
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:07,992
<i>But I just knew.</i>

959
01:41:08,083 --> 01:41:11,452
<i>And last week, he died.</i>

960
01:41:11,544 --> 01:41:13,786
<i>I think ma's very sad, inside.</i>

961
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:15,789
<i>But Marie says time's a great healer,</i>

962
01:41:15,882 --> 01:41:19,796
<i>and Ma's not to worry any more,</i>
<i>cos she's still got me.</i>

963
01:41:20,804 --> 01:41:23,425
<i>Anyway, I've got to go now. My tea's ready.</i>

964
01:41:23,515 --> 01:41:25,803
<i>I hope it's not chips.</i>

965
01:41:25,892 --> 01:41:27,849
<i>I've had them three times this week.</i>

966
01:41:29,312 --> 01:41:32,681
<i>Maybe you'll come and see us one more time.</i>

967
01:41:32,774 --> 01:41:34,932
<i>Maybe next time your ship docks.</i>

968
01:41:35,026 --> 01:41:36,983
<i>Your friend, Frankie.</i>

969
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,057
