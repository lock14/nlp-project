1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
Oh, my!

3
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,300
Mrs. Jones, Rosemary Jones?

4
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,500
Rosie, please, I prefer Rosie.

5
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Is everything alright?
- Yes, fine...

6
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
I was just checking the...

7
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
trunk, the big leather trunk.
Is that yours?

8
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,300
Yes, that's mine.

9
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Good, thank you. Good.

10
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Mrs. Jones?

11
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Good morning, officers.

12
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Two dismembered bodies, Rosemary.

13
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
Why don't you just tell me who they are?

14
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,000
My husband and his mistress.
They were planning to run away together.

15
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
So you thought
you'd just kill them instead.

16
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,400
Well, I couldn't very well
stand idly by, could I?

17
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Rosemary Jones, you've been found guilty
for the crime of manslaughter.

18
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Manslaughter! And at the time
you committed these acts,

19
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,000
you were suffering from such an
abnormality of mind,

20
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,700
that it seriously impaired
your responsibility.

21
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,100
I therefore make an order
for your detention...

22
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,800
in a secure unit
for the criminally insane.

23
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Not to be free,

24
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
until such time as the home secretary
decides that your continued detention...

25
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
is no longer necessary
for the protection of the public.

26
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
I don't suppose there's any chance
for a cup of tea, is there?

27
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,600
Thank you very much for coming.
Very nice to see you again.

28
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,100
Goodbye Mrs. Martin.
- Marvelous sermon, Vicar.

29
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,400
Very kind, thank you.

30
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,400
Thank you, Reverend Goodfellow.
- You're very welcome, Mrs. Parker.

31
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,600
I just wanted to have a word with you
about the flower arranging committee.

32
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Oh, ah, yes of course. Perhaps...
- This afternoon.

33
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Mrs. Goodfellow is not with you again?

34
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh no, no. Sorry about that.
She's been very busy. Mrs. Parker.

35
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,400
Next week perhaps?
- Perhaps, yes.

36
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,400
Although,
she is incredibly busy at the moment.

37
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
Oh!

38
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,500
For fuck's sake. Jesus Christ!

39
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,000
What's a girl got to do to get
a decent nights sleep around here?

40
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,700
Holly!

41
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Don't forget about Tuesday.
- Oh sorry, it's Tuesday.

42
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh, Petey.

43
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,400
Fuck off.
Holly, it's time to wake up.

44
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,700
Holly...

45
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Holly, I know you're in there,
would you please come out, right away!

46
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,800
Mother!
I don't think you want me to do that.

47
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think you'll find I bloody well do.

48
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Is that you, Carl?
No, this is Mark.

49
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,700
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Goodfellow.

50
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,900
Holly, this is totally unacceptable.
- I'm 17, it's been legal for a year.

51
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,900
Legal does not make it decent.

52
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,000
Is everything alright, Mrs. Goodfellow?

53
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,900
Yes, everything is fine, Mrs. Parker.

54
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is that Holly I heard?
- Holly? No.

55
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,900
Oh. Morning, Mrs. Parker.

56
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,100
Morning.

57
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,700
You know the thing that pains me the most?
- No. But you'll tell me anyway.

58
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
You're an intelligent girl.
- An intelligent girl who's got a libido.

59
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
An intelligent girl knows
what to do with it. - I know it.

60
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Oh, Holly.

61
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,100
We used to be such friends.
Hello.

62
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,900
Now you cross with me all the time.
- Because you are a total and utter bitch.

63
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Ah, look at you two. Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

64
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,700
It's sort of as we feared, the pond.

65
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,100
I've been chatting with the chaps
at the Water Board. Looks like it's algae.

66
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,700
It could be one of two
or three different types apparently.

67
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Some of them poisonous.
They're worried about the water-table.

68
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,900
Anyway, they say it will get worse
if it's not dealt with.

69
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,200
A lot of things will get worse
if they're not dealt with.

70
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,800
They'll come back to me with the details.
- The devil's in the details, Dad.

71
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
Could we not say that word on a Sunday.

72
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Dad!

73
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Alright.
- Where are you going now?

74
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,400
I've got work to do.
- You've just been to work.

75
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I've got to write a speech
for that convention,

76
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
God's mysterious ways,

77
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,200
and that's all I've got to show for it,
a title.

78
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,700
See, you're an utter bitch to him.
- No, I'm not.

79
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
And I know why, you're not getting any.
- What?

80
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,000
The same reason
you're angry with me and Mark.

81
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,400
Oh, in the van, in front of the house,
on a Sunday.

82
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
That might have more to do with it.
- I don't think so.

83
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,500
Oh, you must be right then.
- Well, I usually am.

84
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,000
Can I get you any?

85
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Petey, how long have you been there?
- Holly says you're not getting any.

86
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Can I get you some?
- Oh Petey, that's very thoughtful,

87
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
but no, you can't.

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,700
Let's face it. I'm no good at this.
- No, you just need a little tweaking,

89
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
a little Lance adjustment,
but that's another story.

90
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,700
Alright now, Gloria.

91
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,700
I told you that the key is in the swing.
- Well, I never had a good swing.

92
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,600
I disagree.
I bet you could swing really well.

93
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Now, you grip that shaft,
gently but firmly.

94
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,100
Now, spread your legs. A little more.
- Oh.

95
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Now you bend to the ball slowly.

96
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah. Now, bend your knees.

97
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Yeah.

98
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,900
Feel good?
- Yes, feels fine.

99
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Okay.

100
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,100
Now you just keep your eye on the ball.
- Okay.

101
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,900
You let me worry about the hole.
- Right.

102
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,700
That's quite good.
- Well, your ball is in the rough,

103
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
but it's a good feeling, huh?
- Yeah.

104
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
One more?

105
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Okay.

106
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,900
Mrs. Parker asked after you again
this morning. - Surprise, surprise.

107
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,100
I think I'm beginning to run out excuses.
- Well, then don't make any.

108
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,000
You know what you can do, you can go down
and kill that bloody dog,

109
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
and I'll put in a month of Sundays.

110
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,400
Was that a brassier
over Holly's shoulder this morning?

111
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
You're a half day behind the rest of us,
you know that?

112
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
We call it a bra nowadays.

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,900
Why did she have it over her shoulder?

114
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,600
She was doing the laundry.

115
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,900
Mr. Brown?

116
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Mr. Brown, it's Mrs. Goodfellow,
about Clarence, it's about your dog.

117
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,100
You woke me.
- Yes, well, your dog woke me.

118
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,900
What did you say?
- I said your dog woke me.

119
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,400
Well, he's found his voice.
- Yes, he has, hasn't he?

120
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,500
I was wondering whether we could perhaps
keep him inside just the night-time.

121
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,400
Got your sandwiches and sports bag?
Yes. Yes!

122
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Daddy is picking you up this afternoon.
- But Daddy forgets.

123
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,200
No! And tomorrow it's a new housekeeper,
and she's paid not to forget.

124
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,400
I thought you were going to be brave
and take the bus this year. - Next year.

125
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,900
No, you said that last year.
Come on, you're going to have a good time.

126
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,100
See you around, Goodfellow.

127
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,600
My shoelace is undone.

128
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Tell me about when you were a girl.
- Oh Petey, you know already.

129
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,800
Alright then.

130
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,800
When I was a girl,
I lived in a big scary house.

131
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,900
With the black women.
- No, they wore black, they were nuns.

132
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,900
Mostly Irish, and mostly evil.

133
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,600
And you were there because you were awful.
- No, I was an orphan. Orphan, darling.

134
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Come on, off you go have a good day.
- Remember to make Daddy remember.

135
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,700
Promise.

136
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Oh, she's here already? The housekeeper.

137
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,800
No, no, just her trunk.
It arrived while you were out.

138
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
It's a lovely old thing. Isn't it?
Well, well, well.

139
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Look at that. Grace.

140
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Is it a sign, do you think?
- No, I think it's a trunk.

141
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,800
In the books I read when I was a boy
there was always a trunk just like this,

142
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,000
full of treasure.
- You will remember to pick up Pete?

143
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I can't this afternoon.
- Alright. I'll write it down.

144
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,900
I've got to take Mrs. Applebee
to the garden centre.

145
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
Now, where's the pen? The Pen?

146
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh, look at this.

147
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,500
You've made it really nice up here.
Grace should be very happy.

148
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
You know, Lilian and Brian have made love
in every single room in their house.

149
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Their house is smaller.
- Yes, but they went around twice.

150
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm late for work already.
- So, what's half an hour?

151
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,100
You take this off, and you're just
a man, Walter Goodfellow.

152
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,600
Don't forget Petey, now.

153
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh, Lord, yes.
I think I wrote it down.

154
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
Yep.

155
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,900
Hello!

156
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,400
Petey!

157
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,100
Petey?

158
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Walter?

159
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,400
Hi, Darling. We're just talking
about the Algae and... - Where's Petey?

160
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,600
Oh Lord. I'm sorry. Mrs. Hallyway rang me
about her crisis of faith.

161
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,500
She was on the verge of losing it.
- I know the bloody feeling.

162
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,300
Let's get him.
- No, this is really unnecessary.

163
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,400
Should I push him?
Do you want to be pushed? - No, please.

164
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm going to count to three. Three.
- No!

165
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,500
See you in the morning.

166
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Oh, deary, deary me. Look at you.

167
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Give me a hand. Let me help you up.
You look so uncomfortable.

168
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,700
No one has a clue where he is.
- I don't understand.

169
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,600
There he is!

170
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,700
Who the bloody hell is that?

171
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hey, what are you doing with my son?

172
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Come here, come on. Quick.
- Oh.

173
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
You must be Gloria.
- Get in the car.

174
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,600
Look, I think,
there might be a misunderstanding.

175
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
You bet your life
there's a misunderstanding.

176
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,300
Grace Hawkins.

177
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,900
You're Grace Hawkins.
- Yes.

178
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
Mrs. Hawkins, welcome to Little Wallop.
- Thank you, Vicar.

179
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,700
I'm sorry about earlier, Mrs. Hawkins.
- Oh, no. Not at all.

180
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,400
Under the circumstances
you did just the right thing.

181
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,700
I could have been anybody,
and please call me Grace. - Reverend!

182
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,800
Ah, Mrs. Parker, may I introduce you
to our new housekeeper, Grace Hawkins.

183
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Mrs. Parker is chairman... chair of the
St. Michael's Flower Arranging Committee.

184
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Which I wanted to talk to you about.
- We will talk about it, we really will,

185
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,200
but Grace has literally just arrived,
and I was wondering... - The tricks...

186
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,600
We'd better go in. They'll be forever.
...are quite unbelievable.

187
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,300
In my whole experience
in 43 years on this committee.

188
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I'm well aware of this problem.

189
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,500
Oh, this is just...

190
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,500
He's a persistent little fellow, isn't he?
- It's not what I call him.

191
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,500
I've given it a good airing,
but it's still a little bit musty.

192
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh no, it's perfect.

193
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,900
It's just as I imagined it.
A perfect home for a perfect family.

194
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,500
Well, let's hope they make us an offer.
- A sense of humor.

195
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,500
I like that.
- Good, because you're going to need one.

196
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,200
There you go again.

197
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,100
How are we going to get that upstairs?
- Oh, we'll find a way.

198
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,200
What do you think is in it?
- I don't know and I didn't ask.

199
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,300
Holly!
- I just want to know what's in it.

200
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Memories, dear.

201
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
A life time of memories.

202
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,700
And a few clothes.

203
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
You must be Holly. My, you are tall.

204
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
You must get that from your father's side.

205
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,900
Oh, this is David.
- Hi.

206
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,200
Oh!

207
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,000
The women in this family certainly share
a taste for good looking fellows.

208
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,600
Holly, are you taking the weight?
- This way.

209
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,600
A sharp left, darling.
- Watch it, watch it.

210
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Sorry, sorry.
Now this door's very narrow.

211
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,200
Slowly down. Watch your fingers.
That's fine.

212
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,600
Well now, I don't think the occasion
should go by without a few words.

213
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,800
Walter.
- Just a few words, Gloria.

214
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,100
Lord, thank you for this day.

215
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,700
And thank you for bringing us Grace,

216
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,100
who joined our family today and who
we hope will be very happy here.

217
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,900
And thank you also for Carl...

218
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,100
Mark...
- David.

219
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,800
David,

220
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
who we've also only just met, actually,

221
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,700
but who seems to be a very... ah...

222
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,000
nice young man indeed.
- Amen.

223
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,200
Alright, who would like a cup of tea?
- Yeah, we'd better get going.

224
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,300
Thank you for that, Walter. Vicar, sir.
- Oh, you're very welcome, Grace.

225
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,500
I meant every word.
- Thank you.

226
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
God, you drive me crazy.

227
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,900
Oh God.
- No...

228
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,400
No, stop, stop!

229
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,100
Okay, I know where we could drive.
That's five minutes away. - Not the shed.

230
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
You know it?
- Of course I know it!

231
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm the Vicar's wife, Lance.
I'd have to drive half a day...

232
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,200
before I'm not recognized.
- So let's stay.

233
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,500
You want our first time to be in a car.
- Honey, I just want our first time.

234
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm not doing it in a car.

235
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,900
Women in my age don't do it in cars.
That's the sort of thing my daughter does.

236
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,100
She does? No, I hear you.
- There's a time and a place, Lance.

237
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Like Mexico.
- Exactly, like Mexico.

238
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,800
Which is exactly where we are going to be.
- When?

239
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Soon, I promise.

240
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,600
I just want a break.
I just need a break.

241
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,400
Just a couple of weeks.
- We'll be there in a heartbeat, baby.

242
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Naked and living of the fruits of love.

243
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Warm sun.
- Tequila.

244
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Hot salsa.

245
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,500
Would that be the music or the food.
- I think, a bit of both.

246
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Ah!

247
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Good night then.
- A little good night kiss.

248
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,700
Are you crazy? They're all watching.
That's Mrs. Parker! - Who?

249
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Oh, come on. She probably...
She probably can't even see.

250
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Just pretend you're a taxi and go.
Go on.

251
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,300
I'll call you.
- What the hell am I doing?

252
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I hope you know because I have no clue.

253
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,900
Wow! Oh my Lord.

254
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,500
So you must be Holly.

255
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,100
See you next time sweetie.

256
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,300
Jesus Christ.

257
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Can't we have some good old fashioned rock
to smite that little fucker dead.

258
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,400
Then I might start listening to you again.

259
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm sorry, did I startle you?
- No, no. Is everything okay?

260
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Oh yes. I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you very much.

261
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,500
No, not at all. It's me
who should be thanking you, really.

262
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Well, good night, dear.
- Good night.

263
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,800
You know, my father was a minister.
- Really?

264
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
That's a coincidence.
- So, I know their little ways.

265
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,400
Well I think you'll find
Walter is quite set in his.

266
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,100
You just leave him to me, dear.
- Why couldn't I just do that.

267
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,600
Should I close the door?
- That would be lovely.

268
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,700
Good night, dear.
- Good night.

269
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,000
Alright.

270
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Oh!

271
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Clarence!

272
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
Clarence?

273
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Where's that bloody dog?

274
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Wakey, wakey.

275
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I thought you deserved a lie-in.

276
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Breakfast is ready when you are.

277
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,300
Oh, I slept straight through.
- Makes a change.

278
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,900
Fantastic.

279
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,400
Grace, this is absolutely fantastic.
- Thank you, Vicar. Here's a toast, dear.

280
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,200
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day, did you know that, Holly?

281
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I vaguely remember Mom
failing to drum that into me.

282
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,300
Good morning.

283
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,500
As it's such a big day for you, Vicar,
I've given you extra.

284
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,900
It's only a bit of fun, Grace.
- Oh, can't I talk you out of it.

285
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
No.

286
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
It's going to be the most embarrassing day
of my life, again.

287
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,400
It's all in a good cause.
- That doesn't make it less embarrassing.

288
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,700
I think it could be fun.
- She's new, she'll learn.

289
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Chin up, chin up.
- I just need to warm up a bit, I think.

290
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,100
Bad luck Vicar.
- Oh dear.

291
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
No, I just can't watch.
- Oh, Holly.

292
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,200
Why hang around just to see him humiliate
himself in front of the whole village?

293
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,000
As if I don't get enough of that
every Sunday.

294
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,500
He's a handsome fellow, isn't he?
- What?

295
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,100
Your husband.

296
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Come on!

297
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,900
Cuts quite an athletic figure.

298
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll be back in a minute.

299
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,700
Let's cheer for your father, shall we,
perhaps that'll help. - Come on, Dad.

300
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Come on, Vicar.
- Hi.

301
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,300
Perhaps next time.
- I'm sorry.

302
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,500
I was waving. Oh dear.

303
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,400
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry about that.
- Come on, Vicar.

304
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,500
Pray for guidance, Vicar.

305
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,300
That was only just in.

306
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Sorry.

307
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,300
Sorry.

308
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
You alright, Vicar?
- Oh, I'm fine.

309
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,100
I'm just winded. I think I'm fine.
- No, no.

310
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I promise you. I'm sure I can carry on.
- Take a breather.

311
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,500
Come on.
- You okay, Dad?

312
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Yes, I'm fine. - Hard luck, Vic.
Oh, thank you, Grace. I did my best.

313
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Would you like a nice hot cup of tea?
- That sounds wonderful, Grace.

314
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Come on, let's get your father some tea.
- Thank you.

315
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,400
To me, to me!

316
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,100
That was bad luck out there, Reverend.
- Thank you.

317
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,900
Well, I guess these things happen?
- Yes, they certainly do. They just did.

318
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,400
I went for the ball, Ref.

319
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Well, I got to hand it to you,
Walter,

320
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
you sure took it like a man,
I'll say that for you.

321
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm sorry, I... Have we...
- Oh, sorry, Lance.

322
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,500
I see your wife.

323
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm her golf pro.
- Oh yes.

324
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,700
She takes her golf very seriously.

325
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Yeah, always comes on time, too.

326
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Oh yes, she's very good like that.
Very good.

327
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,200
Well...

328
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Nice to meet you, Walter.
- Nice to meet you, Lance.

329
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,900
Are you trying to make this
as awkward as possible?

330
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,700
We were just two guys shooting the breeze.

331
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Nothing to worry about.
Besides, you can't blame a man...

332
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,200
for wanting to check out his competition.
- Yeah, but that's my husband.

333
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,000
So, guess what.

334
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,100
I talked to my travel guide last night.
- Really? And what did he say?

335
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,400
When are we leaving?
- It's all good.

336
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,300
Here you go, Petey.

337
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,100
I'll drive so I can show you the way,
then you can drive. - I can't.

338
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,200
No, it's alright you're on my insurance.
- No, I can't drive.

339
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Well, it's never to late to learn.
Good morning.

340
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,800
Hi, you haven't seen Clarence, have you?
- No, I'm afraid not.

341
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,600
It's not like him,
it's not like him at all.

342
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,600
Oh, dear. Never mind, the best night's
sleep I've had in a long time.

343
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Every cloud has a silver lining.

344
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
Clarence!

345
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,800
You little bugger, where are you?
Clarence!

346
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,600
Get out of the way! Move!

347
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,800
I've got to order a new track suit.
Would you like me to come in with you?

348
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,900
Is that a good idea?
- Yeah.

349
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,500
So in Mexico
they have these endless miles...

350
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,900
of perfect glistening white sand beaches.

351
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And what we're going to do,
for the rest of our lives,

352
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,500
is to find our own little stretch,
our own little private place,

353
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,400
just you and me.

354
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,600
And then what I going to do,

355
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,300
is, I am going to cover your body
with coconut cream every day,

356
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
and I am going to start at your toes,

357
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,500
and I going to lick my way up slowly
all the way to your little...

358
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Well, that sounds lovely.
When do we go?

359
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Fuck!

360
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,600
How was he? - Oh, petrified.
Oh, poor Petey.

361
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Hello?

362
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Hello, Lilian. I can't really talk
right now, can I call you back, later?

363
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,900
I found the perfect spot.
- Bye.

364
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,100
Yes, that was Lilian,
an old friend of mine.

365
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,400
Clarence!

366
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Clarence!

367
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,100
Clarence, where are you?

368
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,800
And then once we broke into the boy's
college in the middle of the night,

369
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,600
me and some friends and did
a striptease for the lads.

370
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,300
It wasn't any old college either,
it was religion and philosophy.

371
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Is that where you met Walter?
- That's where I met Walter.

372
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,500
He was post-grad and I was a first year,
and he was...

373
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,700
He was just different from the others.

374
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,300
Still is. Not many like him around.

375
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,600
Put your finger on here, will you?
- But why is it,

376
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,900
when they eventually do find God,
that they lose their sense of humor?

377
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,400
Oh.

378
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
Hello?

379
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,000
Lilian, again.

380
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,900
Where are you?

381
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,200
That was Lilian and I'm going for a nip
into town and meet her for lunch.

382
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,200
Lilian?

383
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,500
I'd so like to meet her.
- Yes, of course! Uhm...

384
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,500
I'll sort something out.

385
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,100
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

386
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,600
Gods ways are mysterious,
that's why we say:

387
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,700
God's mysterious ways.

388
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,500
I mean, look at Job and all
that befell him. He asks the Lord:

389
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,900
"Why are you doing all of this to me?"

390
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,200
And God could have explained,

391
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,100
but instead he just said:
"Trust me, Job."

392
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,900
Now that's mysterious.

393
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
God?

394
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,000
Yes, Walter?

395
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,600
How do you think it's sounding?

396
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Well, the title stinks, for a start.

397
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,600
Hi, I'm sorry.
I can't agree with God about that.

398
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Goodness, Grace.
- Hope you don't mind.

399
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,000
No, no, no, I was just practicing
for the convention.

400
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,200
It's very thought provoking.

401
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Dry and boring, I think, you mean.

402
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
But that's me all over.
- Nonsense.

403
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,800
I'm not the most vibrant of individuals.

404
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,800
A bit serious, perhaps.

405
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,400
You've hit the nail on the head there.
- Reverend Goodfellow!

406
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,700
Reverend Goodfellow! I just wanted
to speak to you about...

407
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,200
Mrs. Hawkins.
- Mrs. Parker.

408
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,200
Is it possible to have a word with you,
privately?

409
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,600
It's about
the flower arranging committee.

410
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,100
It has taken a turn for the worse.
I have never in all my life,

411
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,300
I have never, never...
- Mrs. Parker,

412
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,600
the Reverend is practicing his sermon.

413
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Ah, yes,
I have a convention coming up.

414
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,700
I see.

415
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,300
Very well.

416
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Goodbye, Mrs. Parker.

417
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,100
Oh, dear. I hope that didn't...
- Of course not.

418
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,100
For goodness sake, you are a busy man,
Vicar, people should realize that.

419
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,200
Right.

420
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Yes.

421
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
Now.

422
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,100
About your sermon.

423
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,800
Yes?

424
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
Do you like jokes?

425
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Jokes?

426
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,500
So you see, God is very tired
and he say to St. Peter:

427
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
"Look, Peter... Petey," he says,

428
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,200
"I'm absolutely exhausted.
I need a holiday, I really do.

429
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Is there anywhere you can suggest?"
So,

430
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,600
St. Peter thinks for a bit,
and then he says: "Well I know,"

431
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
he says, "what about the moon?"

432
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,000
And God said: "No, I don't think so.
Not the moon, there's no atmosphere."

433
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,100
Yeah, that's funny.
- I'm not finished, yet. So then God says:

434
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,000
"I really want something different." So,
St. Peter says: "Well, what about Earth?"

435
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,200
And God says:
"No, I went there 2000 years ago.

436
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,100
I met this nice little Jewish girl,
and they're still talking about it."

437
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,600
I did good, huh?

438
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,500
You look beautiful.

439
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,400
After you.

440
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,000
Fabulous, right?
- Oh yes!

441
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,000
The tickets are on their way.

442
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,800
Baby! Oh, baby!

443
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,700
Oh, this is it! Oh God.

444
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,400
I need...
- Wait!

445
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
What?
- Let me take my clothes off.

446
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,900
Okay.

447
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, man. Oh, God almighty!

448
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,000
Slow, slow, slow.

449
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,300
Oh, yeah! Oh, God almighty.
You make me crazy.

450
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,400
Oh God, what's that?
- What?

451
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,200
That.

452
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,700
This is my love thing.
- I know what it is.

453
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,200
I thought you Brits
like this kind of thing. - No.

454
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,300
You do not think this is hot?

455
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,400
No.

456
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,800
You didn't turn your phone off.

457
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,900
Hello?

458
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,700
What?

459
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,400
Who the hell's this? Oh.

460
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
A girl.
- I don't know any girls.

461
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,300
I got it, I'll just take it off.
- No, keep it on.

462
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,900
In fact you could put everything back on.
I think we had quite enough for today.

463
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,300
Good Lord.

464
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,600
"Giggle with God".

465
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,400
Oh no.

466
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,300
Is everything alright, Vicar?

467
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,700
It's just so quiet, Grace.

468
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,900
Lovely, isn't it?

469
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,400
Have a good afternoon.
- And you.

470
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,100
Very good.

471
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,500
Is your dad going to make
you pray tonight?

472
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,000
Shut up.
- Does he make you pray to baby Jesus?

473
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,800
Just leave me alone.
- Run to granny, you prat.

474
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,200
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

475
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,300
You know, I was wondering, if you had
a magic word, what word would it be?

476
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,400
I mean, what's your favorite word?
- My favorite word?

477
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,300
Broccoli
- Broccoli?

478
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,000
Well, I don't know. Why not?

479
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,600
It's alright, Petey, it's alright.

480
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,400
You just close your eyes.
Keep them closed.

481
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,700
Now say the magic word.

482
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,800
Broccoli.

483
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,400
Now open them.

484
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,600
See what happens.

485
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,000
Look, there's God boy.
- It's alright.

486
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,500
You're dead, God boy, you're dead!

487
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
My breaks aren't working!
- I can't stop!

488
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Who's that?
- He's Billy Martin.

489
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,800
Wow! Good old Broccoli.
Shall we have some for supper?

490
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,600
Hi, Mom.

491
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,500
You know, flour can be so sensual.

492
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,300
In Heaven it took me 3 months to find
a priest up here for the wedding.

493
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,600
How long do you think it would take me
to find a lawyer? - Yeah, I like that.

494
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,100
Oh, Gloria, you're back.
This is Mark... ah...

495
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,100
David... ah...
- Grant.

496
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,800
Oh, now this is a good one.
Holly! Come and listen to this.

497
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,600
Sit down. So...

498
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:14,100
This Vicar is stopped for speeding,
and the policeman smells alcohol...

499
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,900
and sees an empty bottle of wine
on the passenger's side floor.

500
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,100
And he says: "Have you been drinking,
Reverend?". And the vicar says,

501
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,900
all innocent, like...

502
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,400
all innocent, like...

503
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,600
And the vicar says all innocent,
like:

504
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,100
"Just water, Officer." And the policeman
looks over to the bottle and says:

505
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,400
"Well, that looks like wine to me."

506
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,000
"Wine!" cries the Vicar,
"Good Lord, he's done it again."

507
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,900
That's funny.
- Yes, that is quite funny, isn't it?

508
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,400
Mummy! Mummy!

509
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,500
Billy Martin came after me,
but Grace was there and I said "Broccoli",

510
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,600
and now he's dead. Billy Martin's dead!
- Oh my!

511
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,500
Aren't you a busy bee?
- Grace, this is Grant.

512
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,000
Ah... Is it Halloween?

513
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,400
Jokes, Grace. Have lots of them!
- Oh, well done, you.

514
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,900
Oh... isn't this nice?
Billy Martin is dead!

515
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Could we have a word?
Billy Martin is dead?

516
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,400
Oh good Lord, no. No, he's not dead,
he was just unconscious, if I may judge.

517
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,700
But, please, don't tell Petey,
because he's so excited.

518
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,800
Grace, can you come and look at the pie?
- Of course, dear.

519
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,100
I fucked up big time.
- She shouldn't use that language.

520
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,300
Let me get this straight.
My son's rid of his bullies.

521
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,100
My husband has become a comedian.

522
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,100
And my nymphomaniac daughter
has discovered cookery.

523
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,800
What's going on?

524
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,500
Oh, I'm so sorry!

525
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm so sorry. Did I wake you?
- No, not at all.

526
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Did I disturb you and Walter?
- Chance, be a fine thing.

527
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,000
Good night.
- Good night. You know,

528
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,200
men do sometimes lose their way, dear.

529
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,200
I mean, Walter is sweet soul,
but he's a bit...

530
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,300
slow-witted like the rest of them.

531
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,900
I'm sure he'll find his way back to you
in the end.

532
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,300
So you were married, too?
- Yes, I was. A long time ago.

533
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,100
Did he lose his way?
- With a little help from another woman.

534
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,200
Oh.
- Completely lost his head over her.

535
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
Do you have a couple of minutes?

536
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,000
You sit down.
I've got something to show you.

537
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,900
Oh, here it is.

538
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,100
Look, that's me when I was six.

539
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,000
So sweet.
- I was a live one.

540
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,900
Was?

541
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,000
Here he is. That's him.

542
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,500
What was his name?

543
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,400
Arthur.

544
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,700
He's very dapper.

545
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,600
I was a fool for a handsome fellow.
I was young. I was very young.

546
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,700
Too young.

547
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,700
And then he dabbled.

548
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,100
And that was that.

549
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,500
Walter only dabbles with God nowadays.

550
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,300
In that case he'll come back to you.

551
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,600
God would never stand in the way
of such a beautiful young woman.

552
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Will you find your way back to me?

553
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,200
Could you?

554
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,300
Clarence, is that you?

555
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,900
Clarence?

556
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,000
Oh my God! Clarence!

557
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,500
God!

558
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,500
Do you think he found that bloody dog yet?
- Oh, Mr. Brown is on holiday.

559
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,700
Is he? Where has he gone?

560
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,900
I think, he said Down Under.
- Oh.

561
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,500
Hey.

562
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,800
So...

563
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,400
I have been up every night thinking.

564
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:30,700
If we only get one chance for happiness
in our entire lives, Gloria,

565
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,200
that nobody should ever die
without having found it.

566
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,300
I'm not alone.
- Huh?

567
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,100
I'm not alone.

568
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,900
Oh.

569
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,000
So, I talked to my guy,

570
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,200
and Mexico is on.

571
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,000
I got a date tomorrow.
- What?

572
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,900
I told you, when I move fast...

573
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,600
Oh, that's too fast, change it.
- I can't, the ticket's are booked.

574
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,600
Change the tickets.
- Honey, they're booked.

575
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,500
You can't change them?

576
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,500
Gloria, this is everything
we've been dreaming of.

577
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,700
And the hotel? - Hotel's perfect.
On the beach, like you said?

578
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,000
Yes! I mean, walking distance, seconds.
- The best hotels are on the beach, Lance.

579
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,700
Gloria,
this is so much better than a hotel.

580
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,300
For fuck's sake, it's a time share.
- Here we are.

581
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,400
Oh, Grace! Grace, this is Lance,
my golf instructor.

582
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,800
Lance, that is Grace, our housekeeper.
- It is very nice to meet you, Grace.

583
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,100
Gloria has told me all about you.
- You're American.

584
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,100
Yes.
- That obvious, huh?

585
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,100
Well, please don't let me interrupt you.
- Oh, sorry.

586
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,400
We just talked about our next session,

587
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,100
our next practice session of golf.
Weren't we, Lance?

588
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,900
Right, practice session.
- We can talk about it later, can't we?

589
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,700
Well, actually...
I kind of need to know now.

590
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,700
It can't wait?
- It's all confirmed.

591
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,400
Well, I have concerns.
- What... kind of concerns?

592
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,400
I just want to make sure we have
the right equipment... the right kit.

593
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,600
I'm not sure we have the right wood.

594
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,400
Hey, you are talking to me.

595
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,200
You do not have to worry yourself
about wood.

596
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,400
Yes or no, Gloria?

597
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,200
Alright.

598
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,700
Okay. Good.

599
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,600
It was nice to meet you, Lance.

600
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,800
It's a pleasure to meet you, too, Grace.

601
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,900
About 5 o'clock? The place?

602
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,600
The usual place?
- Okay.

603
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,100
Okay, well, you ladies,
have a lovely lunch.

604
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,800
He's got a marvelous swing.

605
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,900
Has he?

606
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,700
I visit 2000 years ago,
I met this nice Jewish girl,

607
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,800
and they're still talking about it.
Ha, ha, ha...

608
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,700
But joking aside, it's true:

609
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,200
2000 years later,
and we are still talking about it,

610
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,500
and that's because it's something worth
talking about.

611
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,300
Oh, Grace.

612
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,100
With these jokes, things come alive.

613
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,900
They really do.
- Excellent.

614
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,100
You're doing very well, Vicar.
- Thank you.

615
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,300
Now, have you thought about sex?

616
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,700
Ah...

617
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,400
Sex?
- Yes.

618
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,200
For the convention or...
- The bible is full of sex.

619
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,300
Haven't you noticed?
- The bible?

620
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,400
The song of Solomon, for example.

621
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,800
Ah, no, that is the passionate
declaration of love...

622
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,700
from a devoted man to God.
- No!

623
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,100
It's about sex.

624
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,300
Right.

625
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,200
Here, read it again, Reverend.

626
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,800
I'll make you a cup of tea.

627
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,000
"Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth:

628
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,100
For thy love is better than wine.

629
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,900
His fruit was sweet to my taste.

630
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,400
His left hand is under my head,

631
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,100
and his right hand doth embrace me.

632
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,700
Behold,

633
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,700
thou art fair, my love.

634
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,900
Behold,

635
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,800
thou art fair.

636
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,100
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.

637
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,800
Thine eyes are as doves behind the veil.

638
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,200
And comely is thy mouth.

639
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:13,000
Thy two breasts are like forns
feeding among the lilies.

640
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,100
Thy navel is like a round goblet...

641
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,900
wherein no mingled wine is wanting.

642
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,700
Thy belly is like a heap of wheat,

643
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,200
set about with lilies.

644
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,500
Let thy breasts
be as clusters on the vine.

645
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,400
And thy mouth like the best wine.

646
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,500
Open to me my dove,

647
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,800
for my head is filled
with the drops of the night.

648
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,800
Come, my beloved,

649
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
let us see if the wine flourishes...

650
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,700
and the tender grapes appear...

651
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and the pomegranates bud forth."

652
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,400
Wow... showtime!

653
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,900
Oh. Come on.

654
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,300
Come on to Uncle Lance.

655
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,100
No, no, don't. Come back.

656
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh yeah!

657
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,700
Oh, my Lord.
They're just like little rose petals.

658
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,300
Oh.

659
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,200
Oh!

660
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,100
Oh, bingo!

661
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,700
Oh God, Lance, you're a lucky man.
- Good evening.

662
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,800
Good evening. Can I help you?

663
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,700
Grace, right?
- Yes.

664
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,700
I lost my... Have you seen my wallet?
I seem to have dropped it here.

665
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,100
Got my pen, got my speech,

666
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,900
and I'm really rather nervous.
- You'll be fine, and I'll think of you.

667
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,700
Good.
- Jesus Christ, you two, put it away.

668
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,600
Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dad.

669
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,800
Cheerio, Petey. Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Dad.

670
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,700
Grace.

671
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,500
Forgotten something, darling?

672
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,600
Have you seen Mr. Brown lately?
- No, he's in Australia.

673
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,600
I hope the convention goes well.
- Yes, thank you, Grace.

674
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,800
Goodbye, all.

675
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,500
Reverend Goodfellow!

676
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,800
Reverend Goodfellow!
- Mrs. Parker.

677
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,900
About the flower arranging committee...

678
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
which I will be more than happy to talk
to you about in a few days, when I'm back.

679
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,300
Oh.

680
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,200
I see.

681
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,100
Oh.

682
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,100
I noticed that your housekeeper...

683
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,400
was having a great deal of trouble
with her car last night.

684
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,400
Her car?

685
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,800
That's not Grace's car, Mrs. Parker.
- It's not?

686
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,600
I've seen it there often enough.

687
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,400
At first I thought it was a taxi.

688
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:53,300
Well, goodbyes are never easy,
but it's not forever, dear.

689
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,400
Hello, it's me. It's after five,
and I'm here and you're not.

690
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,300
So, well, it's funny actually,
because I only came here...

691
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:18,200
to tell you that I'm not coming,
but I guess you beat me to it.

692
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:23,800
Perhaps you're already there with
one of those girls you don't know.

693
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,900
Have a nice life, Lance.

694
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,200
<i>Before the break we were talking</i>
<i>about murderers on parole...</i>

695
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh, there you are.

696
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,600
Dinner's at eight?
- He didn't show up then?

697
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,500
What?
- Your American.

698
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,600
Your golf instructor,
your practice session.

699
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,800
No, no, he didn't. He's sick.

700
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,900
Oh.

701
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,300
Yeah, he... he called it off.

702
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,900
Yeah.

703
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,900
<i>A woman they called the Trunk Murderer</i>.

704
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,000
<i>Rosemary Jones, Bill</i>.
<i>- Don't get me started on Rosemary Jones</i>.

705
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:23,800
<i>It really Is a sorry day and a sad society</i>
<i>when someone like her Is released</i>.

706
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,500
<i>I think we have some pictures, do we?</i>
<i>Yes: The Trunk Murderer, so called,</i>

707
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,800
<i>because they found her husband and his</i>
<i>mistress chopped up In her trunk luggage</i>.

708
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,900
<i>A month ago she was released from prison</i>.
- Mom!

709
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,200
Yeah?

710
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,400
I think you'd better see this.

711
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,500
Mom!

712
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,800
<i>A classical pathological psychosis</i>.
<i>- But the parole board said,</i>

713
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:55,200
<i>she demonstrated the capacity to change</i>.
<i>- No, no, the point Is,</i>

714
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,500
<i>that she Is out loose and among us now</i>.
<i>- You mean, she's wandering the streets...</i>

715
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,900
<i>and up to her old tricks again?</i>
<i>- I wouldn't put It past her, Theresa</i>.

716
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,300
Oh my God.

717
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,400
God's Mysterious Ways. I think,
it's a good title, Reverend Goodfellow.

718
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,000
I really do. I like it.
- Really? Thank you.

719
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,100
And they'll like it, too. I'm sure.

720
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,600
I'm taking a look.
- No, I don't think,

721
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,800
it's the appropriate way. Holly!
- Have you ever seen inside it?

722
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,600
No.
- Exactly.

723
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,600
Hang on!

724
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Gloria, are you here? Holly?

725
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,000
Are you up there?

726
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,700
Shit!

727
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,900
Shit!

728
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,800
Hello?

729
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,900
Are you in here?

730
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,500
Alright, my word!

731
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,100
Please be there, Lance.
- Who's Lance?

732
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,400
Here we are.
How does this work again?

733
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,400
Missed call, press green.

734
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,400
Hello?

735
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,900
This is Grace speaking. Would you like
to come out from under the bed?

736
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:39,900
Coming.

737
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,500
Great to see so many new faces here today.
I know some of you came a very long way,

738
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,700
thank you. And some old friends, Morgan.
Great result for the rugby at the weekend.

739
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,900
Now, down to the more serious business
of the day, our opening address.

740
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,100
I'd like to introduce
the Reverend Walter Goodfellow...

741
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,400
from the Parish of Little Wallop!

742
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,700
Good evening.

743
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,700
Good evening, Gentlemen...

744
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,300
Uhm... Ladies and Gentlemen.

745
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,800
Uhm...

746
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,500
It's an honor...

747
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,300
to... to deliver...

748
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,500
the opening address
of the convention,

749
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,000
uhm, and my subject...

750
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,100
is "Cod's Mysterious Ways"...uhm...

751
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
"God's... God's Mysterious Ways",

752
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm sorry,
I'm sure that Cod have mysterious ways.

753
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,900
But it's the mysterious ways of God
that I wanted to talk about this evening.

754
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,800
Cod will just have to wait
for their own convention.

755
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,400
So! God's Mysterious Ways.

756
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,300
I'm so glad we can have this little chat.

757
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,500
What have you done with Lance, Rosemary?
- You know, I prefer Rosie.

758
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,700
It takes me back to my childhood.

759
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,800
What have you done with Lance, Rosie?

760
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,000
Who the hell's Lance?
- Yes, well,

761
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,500
that's the question.
You see, Lance...

762
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,400
Lance liked to make films.

763
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,700
Can you work this, dear?

764
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,900
<i>Showtime</i>.

765
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,400
<i>Come on to Uncle Lance</i>.

766
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,200
Who the hell is this guy? I'll kill him!
- That won't be necessary, dear.

767
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,400
<i>Oh my Lord</i>.
<i>They're just like little rose petals</i>.

768
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,700
What?

769
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,700
Not the type you would have been
happy with in the end, dear.

770
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:30,100
Don't change the subject.
You have a dead man in your trunk!

771
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,500
No, no, he's not in my trunk, dear.
He's in his car.

772
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,700
And that wasn't just any man,
was it, Gloria?

773
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,000
That was your lover.

774
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,100
That was your lover?
- Now, you've got to understand, Holly,

775
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,500
your mother's been very unhappy,
and lonely. Well, you know,

776
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:57,700
your father, well, he's a busy man,
and along comes this handsome American...

777
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:03,400
with his accent and his swing,
not the type I would approve of at all.

778
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,700
You can't go around killing people
just because you don't approve of them.

779
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,400
Oh, that's what my doctors used to say.
On this point we could never agree.

780
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,700
Anyway, I could see,
your affair was ruining the whole family!

781
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,500
You can't expect me to sit back
and do nothing about that, can you?

782
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,900
It has absolutely nothing to do with you!
- It has everything to do with me.

783
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:31,000
It's the least a mother
can do for her dough...

784
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,700
her daughter.

785
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:40,200
That's something else
we need to have a chat about.

786
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,100
They'd send me photos, now and again,
the nuns.

787
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,100
This is one of your mother
when she was your age.

788
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,100
Wow, Mom, you looked gorgeous.

789
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,200
Aren't we forgetting
the small matter of dead bodies?

790
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,000
How did you know about the other bodies?

791
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,600
What other bodies?
- Oh, you didn't know about the others.

792
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,500
What other bodies?

793
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,800
Just Mr. Brown's dog.

794
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,700
And Mr. Brown.

795
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,400
You killed them, too.

796
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,400
I did it for you, dear.

797
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,200
My mother...

798
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:45,800
Oh, I've waited so long for you
to call me that.

799
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,200
So, what do we do now?

800
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,400
And when I'm asked: "Why do Vicars
always answer a question...

801
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,200
by posing another question?",
I always reply:

802
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,600
"Well, why shouldn't we?"

803
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,700
But what, in the end,
all this comes down to,

804
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,800
is how we deal in life
with the problems that we have to face.

805
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,100
Sometimes it's a question
of just taking action,

806
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,500
of making decisions,

807
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,300
of involving others,
of finding your resolve,

808
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,300
and seeing it through.

809
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:35,600
But at other times,
it's about something much less tangible.

810
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,300
Sometimes all it takes is a little grace.

811
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,300
A little of God's grace,

812
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,800
and all our problems seem to fade away.

813
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,600
Now, should we demand
an explanation from our Lord?

814
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,200
Question his methods?

815
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,300
Or should we merely enjoy the benefits?

816
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,300
Well,

817
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,800
I don't think the good Lord
wants us to question too much.

818
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,400
Isaiah, Chapter 55, verse 8:

819
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,500
"My ways are not your ways."

820
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,100
And I think,
what he basically means by that is:

821
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,000
"I'm mysterious, folks.

822
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,000
Live with it."

823
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,900
Thank you very much. Thank you.

824
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,500
Oh, Jesus Christ, I can't do it.
- It's alright.

825
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:29,700
I didn't chop him up or anything
grizzly like that. Where are you going?

826
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,900
I'm not doing it.
- But I can't drive.

827
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,300
I'm not getting in the car.
- But, I'm a learner.

828
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,600
Officially I need someone with me.
- I think, under the circumstances...

829
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,400
the normal rules do not apply.
Grace, wait.

830
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,500
Who is it?
- Mrs. Parker.

831
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,500
I suppose I have to use the pond again.

832
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,500
Again?

833
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,700
No, I don't want to know. I go inside,
and you do whatever you have to do.

834
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:13,200
And I thought being an orphan
was a bad thing.

835
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,600
Oh my God, he's really stiff.

836
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,200
Oh, Holly, do you have to?
- I never saw anything like this before.

837
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,200
Oh my God.

838
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,200
Oh my God.

839
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,400
Oh, my God, that's...

840
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,700
It's just not fair.

841
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,700
Other daughters get to plan weddings,

842
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,600
and bake cakes, and go shopping
with their mothers. And what do I do?

843
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,700
Dispose of dead bodies.
- I could say the same, you know.

844
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,800
Oh, shall put the kettle on?

845
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,600
Men were the downfall of the Jones women
for as long as there were Jones women,

846
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:12,600
and that's why you have to be careful
about the types you bring home, dear.

847
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:17,300
Wild and dangerous might be appealing now,
but believe me, you're on the same road.

848
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,200
You are.
- I should get me a boyfriend like Dad?

849
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh my God, you would, wouldn't you?
- There's nothing wrong with your father.

850
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,400
I knew you were a bitch to him,
but I always thought you loved him.

851
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,100
I do love him.

852
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,000
I do love him.
- Then what about the letch?

853
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,000
I'm assuming Dad doesn't know about him?

854
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,000
Because I don't think he should,
I don't think he should know anything.

855
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,300
Right, Grace?
- Mom's the word, dear.

856
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh, you're awake. I brought you some tea.
- Thank you.

857
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:29,400
Mrs. Parker, last night, do you think
she might have seen something?

858
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,700
No, why?

859
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,600
She's on her way over.

860
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,000
That doesn't mean to say she saw anything.
- Who?

861
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,300
What are you talking about?
- Mrs. Parker, maybe she saw something.

862
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,100
She did not see anything last night.
- She saw you last night.

863
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,200
No.
- Possibly.

864
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,900
Oh my God!
- I'll see to her.

865
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:02,400
Oh no, you won't. You'll stay right here.
You've seen to quite enough already.

866
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,400
Oh my God.
- Just keep calm.

867
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Mrs. Goodfellow, did I wake you?

868
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,400
Actually, yes.
- I was hoping your husband would be home.

869
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,100
I need to speak to him.
- No, sorry, he's away.

870
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,300
He's on a three day convention.
- It's about the...

871
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,800
the flower arranging committee.

872
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,300
Oh, uhm...

873
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,600
you'll have to talk to him, not to me.
- Cynthia Martin...

874
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:36,900
has been doing her level best
to undermine my leadership.

875
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,900
I believe she's planning a coup.

876
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,500
A coup?
- Behind my back, yes!

877
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,200
If you don't mind, I just need to sit.

878
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,100
Behind my back
and behind the Reverend's back as well.

879
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:01,000
It's a disgrace.
I would even go as far as saying,

880
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,100
it is amoral.
And knowing what I know now,

881
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,000
I don't see how I can keep quiet.
- Jesus Christ, I knew it. She knows!

882
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:16,400
And when the Reverend finds out,
he will be mortified, I can assure you.

883
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,900
I'm going to tell him, Mrs. Goodfellow.
- Grace. Grace, no.

884
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,800
No matter how much damage is done,
he must be told.

885
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Well, I'm sure Walter will have
a quiet word with Cynthia Martin,

886
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,000
and it will be all sorted out.
- But it's not just Mrs. Martin.

887
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,800
They've all got
their sordid little agendas.

888
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:41,400
In sixty years, Mrs. Goodfellow,
I have never known anything like it.

889
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:46,700
And in my condition, too.
It's really affecting my heart, you know?

890
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:50,900
I really do wish it didn't have to come
to this, but it does.

891
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,000
Your husband must be told.
- That's quite enough, Mrs. Parker.

892
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,400
Out of the way, dear.
- What are you doing?

893
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:02,300
I will not have this family torn apart
after all we've been through.

894
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:07,200
She knows! She was going to tell dad.
- About the flower arranging committee!

895
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,000
This has nothing to do
with anything else...

896
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,300
Mrs. Parker?
- Oh, dear.

897
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,000
Mrs. Parker, can you hear me?
- Shit, is she...

898
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,000
Yes, I believe she is.

899
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,700
Oh, God. Oh, God.

900
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:33,500
She said herself, she had a dickey heart.
- I think you might have a dickey heart,

901
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,900
if someone came at you with a frying pan.
- Well, it was a simple misunderstanding,

902
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,800
it could happen to anybody.
- This cannot go on, mother! It is enough.

903
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I understand you're upset, dear.
- I am! I've got two dead bodies.

904
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,100
One in the pond, one in the sitting room.
- You've got 3 dead bodies in the pond,

905
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,300
you forgot...
- I do not want to know.

906
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,500
This has gone too far, and I mean it.

907
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,600
I understand.

908
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,700
I It's not
as if anyone's going to miss her.

909
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,500
Mom? Dad is back.

910
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,400
Hello!

911
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,300
Hello!

912
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,800
There we are.
- Hello, sweetheart.

913
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,200
Hi, Dad.
- I'll tell you, I've just had the best...

914
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,300
Sorry, I was saying,
I had the best convention.

915
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:36,100
Hello, everyone. Oh, Mrs. Parker.
How are you this morning? - She's fine.

916
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,300
Darling, I thought it was three days.
- It was going to be three days, but...

917
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:44,700
It's so lovely to see you. - Bye, Dad.
I want to hear all about it.

918
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,700
Well, I delivered my sermon.

919
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,900
And, how did it go?
- Very well, I even had them laughing.

920
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,500
But you know what was really amazing?
It was what happened afterwards.

921
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,700
Because I was getting praise
from everybody, from the counsel...

922
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:06,200
and my peers. Normally that would be...
But you know what I was thinking?

923
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,100
Why am I here?

924
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:16,100
Well, you've always been a deep thinker.
- When... what matters most to me...

925
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,000
is back home.

926
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,600
Oh, darling.

927
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,500
So,

928
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:35,400
they made love in every room in the house,
did they, Lilian and Brian?

929
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,000
And they went around twice.
- Twice.

930
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:45,400
I think we have some catching up to do.
- No, I have to see to Mrs. Parker.

931
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,300
Oh, gosh, yes. Do you need me?
- No, it's the flower arranging committee.

932
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,300
I swear, it'll be the death of her.

933
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,800
Mrs. Parker's sudden passing
came as a dreadful shock to us all,

934
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:05,900
but as we well know,
God does move in mysterious ways.

935
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,300
Which reminds me of a keynote address,
which I deliver recently,

936
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,100
of which I think
Mrs. Parker would have approved.

937
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,400
Excellent sermon, Reverend.
- Thank you.

938
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,700
Thank you, goodbye.
- It was. It was very good.

939
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,100
Reverend Goodfellow.
- Mrs. Martin.

940
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:30,500
I wonder if we might have a talk about
the flower arranging committee this week.

941
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,400
No, but perhaps next week.
I'll let you know.

942
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,400
Oh... very well.

943
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,300
Goodbye.

944
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,600
Who is it?

945
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,600
It's me.
- Oh, come in.

946
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,900
I think this is for the best, don't you?

947
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,700
"My dearest Gloria,

948
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,800
it was a slice of heaven
to finally meet you, my dear.

949
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,400
You have made a mad old woman
a very happy mad old women.

950
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,900
I'll miss you and your beautiful family,

951
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,300
but I'll be visiting,
just you try and stop me.

952
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:28,600
Love to you all,
Mother."

953
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:38,700
"Dear Mother, how many months
has it been now? Two, three, four?

954
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yet still we talk about you all the time.

955
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,800
We're looking forward to your visit,
and lots planned for the whole family.

956
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,000
So what's new and exciting here
in Little Wallop, you may ask.

957
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:53,400
Holly's got a very nice new boyfriend,
and she told me to tell you,

958
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,700
that you'd be pleased with her choice.
He's not like the others.

959
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:00,900
I actually believe he might be
a calming influence on her.

960
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:06,400
And Petey's doing very well,
turning into quite a confident young man."

961
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,700
Which reminds me of the time,
an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scotsman,

962
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:14,400
a Vicar, a Rabbi, and a Priest all walk
into a pub, and the barman says:

963
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,600
"What is this, some kind of a joke?"

964
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,900
"Walter's a changed man, too.
I'd even go so far to say,

965
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,500
that our life here together is complete."

966
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:36,100
"I'm by his side in all the ways he needs,
and he's by mine in all the ways I need."

967
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:40,700
Mrs. Parker felt that not enough was being
done to this part of the railings...

968
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,600
inside the church whilst too much
is covered in the front porch.

969
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,900
"By the time you read this you'll have
arrived at your new job. Good luck,

970
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:57,700
I hope there are no hitches, but something
tells me that you'll do fine."

971
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:25,300
Hi, darling. You remember Bob and Ted.
I'm afraid it's as we feared.

972
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,800
The pond. Algae.

973
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Blue-green algae.
- Which apparently is quite serious.

974
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:36,100
It's very serious.
- Very, very serious.

975
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,400
So, we're just discussing the options.
- As I explained to Reverend Goodfellow,

976
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,800
your pond is in the water-table.
So the algae doesn't only effect you,

977
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:49,000
it effects the whole village.
And the blue-green algae...

978
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:53,900
is one of the worst you can get.
So there's really just the one option.

979
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:57,800
Yes, as he says, really there's really...

980
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,900
just the one option.
- Which is?

981
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,900
Drain it.

982
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,100
Drain it.

983
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,800
Shall I put the kettle on?

984
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,100
"So, between you and us,
I'd say life if very good indeed.

985
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:33,200
No dramas, no crisis, it just ambles along
in its quite merry way.

986
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,100
A couple of hiccup here and there,
of course, like the pond.

987
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,300
Which now they tell us needs draining.
Which is a bit of a farce,

988
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,600
as you could imagine,
but I'm sure we'll sort something out."
