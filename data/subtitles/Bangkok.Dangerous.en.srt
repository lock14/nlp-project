1
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,505
My job takes me to a lot of places.
It's got its downsides.

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,175
I sleep alone. I eat alone.

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,469
I'm used to it, though.

4
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,847
I'd like to meet someone ...

5
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,518
... but it's tough
when you live out of a suitcase.

6
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,898
I go where I'm told, do what I'm told.

7
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,608
I shouldn't complain.

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,529
The work is steady. The money's good.

9
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,948
But it's not for everyone.

10
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,193
My name's Joe.

11
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,365
This is what I do.

12
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,081
You're late.

13
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,545
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Svatopluk Bridge.

14
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,264
You are leaving?

15
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,726
I need the phone.

16
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,489
I can help with the bags.

17
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,408
No, I can handle it.

18
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,252
If you ever come back,
I can use the money.

19
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,964
Goodbye.

20
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,444
I was taught four rules.

21
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,490
One: Don't ask questions.

22
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,785
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.

23
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,373
Two: Don't take an interest in people
outside of work.

24
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,917
There is no such thing as trust.

25
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,337
Three: Erase every trace.

26
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,340
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

27
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,886
Four: Know when to get out.

28
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,057
Just thinking about it means it's time.

29
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,520
Before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.

30
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,748
So you look for the right opportunity.

31
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,209
Nothing too risky.

32
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,212
Get the money and disappear forever.

33
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,716
This is it.

34
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,594
Four hits, one location.

35
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,721
The last job.

36
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,851
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr. Vincent?

37
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,686
Holiday.

38
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:14,242
Bangkok. It's corrupt, dirty and dense.

39
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,606
All my clients have one thing
in common:

40
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,108
They feed off the people.

41
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,612
There's big money in misery.

42
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,282
Where there's money,
there's competition.

43
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,202
And the guy paying me usually wins.

44
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,662
It always starts the same way,
just like I was taught.

45
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,706
Secure a safe location ...

46
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,376
... somewhere off the beaten path,
where you have privacy.

47
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,253
But you stay invisible too long ...

48
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,965
... the human race
starts to look like another species.

49
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,093
So you venture out. You observe.

50
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,430
And then you return
to your invisible world ...

51
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,515
... like a ghost.

52
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,905
- Hey, Larry?
- Yeah?

53
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,365
Jesus.

54
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,701
Hi.

55
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,704
- Look at these girls.
- Yeah, what's up?

56
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,372
Hello, gentlemen. How are you?

57
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,915
- First time in Bangkok?
- Yep.

58
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,044
Rolex? Good Rolex, you want?
Yeah, yeah. Look, look, good Rolex.

59
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,130
Watch out, Larry.
How much you wanna bet it's counterfeit?

60
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,549
- Two thousand. Look good.
- No, thanks. No, thanks.

61
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,427
No, no Rolex. Never mind, never mind.
You want girls?

62
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,346
- I can get you girl.
- No.

63
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,847
No girl? How about boys?

64
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,223
- You like boys?
- Oh, no.

65
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,476
You don't like boys, huh?

66
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,561
Hey, how about you, huh, cowboy?

67
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,271
One thousand buy new-car smell ...

68
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,399
... satisfaction, money-back,
super-wrapper-pussy guarantee, huh?

69
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,943
Whatever happens in Bangkok
stays in Bangkok.

70
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,113
Wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

71
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,407
I look for three qualifications:

72
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,037
They have to speak a little English,
they have to wanna make money ...

73
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,956
... and above all,
they have to be disposable.

74
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,213
Do you wanna make some money?

75
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,925
I have work in town. I need some help.

76
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,802
What work?

77
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,473
Pick things up, drop things off.
Maybe some translation.

78
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,435
About a month's work, 2000 a day.

79
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,316
- Dollar?
- Baht.

80
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,236
Bullshit.

81
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,870
Five thousand, huh? Forty-five hundred.

82
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,873
Four thousand.

83
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,252
Two thousand nine hundred
and fifty-two fifty, huh?

84
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,170
What do you say? Come on.

85
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,800
We'll round up. Three thousand.
You get paid at the end of the week.

86
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,468
No deal.

87
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,014
Okay, okay. How about half?
Half now, half at the end of the week, huh?

88
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,812
- What's your name?
- Kong.

89
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,772
Kong?

90
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,196
You can keep that
in the wallet you stole.

91
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,535
Be at 21 Samahan Road tomorrow,
7 p.m.

92
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,122
You come alone or you don't get paid.

93
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,332
Yes, boss.

94
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,245
Take off the shades.

95
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,999
Glasses. Off.

96
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,425
Keep that with you at all times.

97
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,012
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

98
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,848
You answer whenever it rings.

99
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,353
If I call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

100
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,735
Time is very important.

101
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:46,950
If I tell you to be somewhere
and you are a minute late ...

102
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,703
... you don't get paid.

103
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,288
You understand?

104
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,250
- In English.
- I understand.

105
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,088
- You know the Caribbean Club?
- High-class ass.

106
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,758
Ask for a dancer named Aom.
You give her this.

107
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,261
Make sure the X is facing up like this.

108
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,598
She's gonna give you a package.
Don't open it.

109
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,601
- What's in it?
- It doesn't concern you.

110
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,270
Then you go pick it up.

111
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,025
- I'll find someone else.
- Okay, okay, okay. I do it, I do it, I do it.

112
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,821
Come straight back here.

113
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,575
- You don't stop for anything.
- What if I have to piss?

114
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,122
If you ask me one more question --

115
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,917
Then I won't get paid. I know that.

116
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,839
- Okay, I go now, huh?
- Hey.

117
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,633
Take the cell phone.

118
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,796
- You're late, huh?
- Give me the case.

119
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,676
You don't get paid for today.

120
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,303
- Why not?
- Ran from the police.

121
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,431
You told me not to stop.
I do what you say.

122
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,059
"Don't stop. No stop for nothing,
not even for piss."

123
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,311
From now on,
I don't want any more police.

124
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,980
You understand?

125
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:26,270
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

126
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,065
But the eyes never change.

127
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,528
I was taught to start with the eyes.

128
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,935
I'm Kong.

129
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,466
Wait, wait, wait.

130
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,305
The elephant.

131
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,310
The nose. You see, pointing down?

132
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,021
Bad luck. No good.

133
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,523
Bad luck for you.

134
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,775
Good night.

135
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,089
I'm checking on a wire transfer.

136
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:51,137
Account code: 6514346.

137
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,685
Thank you.

138
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,475
Hello.

139
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:43,063
I have a cut and I need some medicine.

140
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,607
Disinfectant.

141
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,568
Do you speak English?

142
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,783
How many?

143
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,746
One.

144
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,797
In the morning? In the morning.

145
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,383
One.

146
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,135
Before bed.

147
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,568
Two hundred and fifty baht, sir.

148
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,035
Thank you.

149
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,759
Oh, I have it.

150
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,673
- You're late.
- Sorry, boss.

151
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,968
Don't be sorry, be on time.

152
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,137
What happened to your face?

153
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,017
Some asshole tried to mug me.

154
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,144
Like 20 of them.

155
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,522
But I kicked their asses.

156
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,445
I'm so sorry, boss.

157
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,906
So sorry.

158
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,699
They take --

159
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,245
It's been opened.

160
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,041
Not me. It's them. They broke it.

161
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,252
But I won't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

162
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,882
I don't let them have it.

163
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,720
There's a beer in the refrigerator.

164
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,097
It'll take down the swelling.

165
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,016
Yes, boss.

166
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,398
He's a bad man.

167
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,400
Who?

168
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,029
The man in the case.
You're going to kill him?

169
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,122
- Can you teach me?
- Teach you what?

170
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,958
Everything.

171
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,086
I can help you.

172
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,226
Please?

173
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,564
Show me.

174
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:58,165
Again.

175
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,755
Good.

176
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,519
That was your first lesson.

177
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,904
Why didn't I kill him?

178
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,033
Maybe it's because ...

179
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,036
... and this is strange ...

180
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,456
... somehow,
when I looked into his eyes ...

181
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,793
... I saw myself.

182
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,380
So I became his teacher.

183
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:51,385
Best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.

184
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,763
So you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

185
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,349
See that man in the red jacket?

186
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,854
What man?

187
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,240
You're living in a city of mirrors.

188
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,995
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel.

189
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,247
Eyes in the back of your head.

190
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,757
Eyes at the back of my head, huh, boss?
I got you now, boss.

191
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,011
I'm not your boss. I'm your teacher.

192
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,304
So I call you aajaan, then.

193
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,151
- Like this?
- Yeah.

194
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,487
How is he bad?

195
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,281
This man?

196
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,658
He hurts many country girls.

197
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,243
From the north.

198
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,289
He buy them from their parents
and sell them.

199
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,833
Young girls, man.

200
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,671
Same like devil, huh, this guy?

201
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,860
How many people have you killed?

202
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,655
I don't think about that.

203
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,033
Do the police know who you are?

204
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,373
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

205
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,502
I know.

206
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,343
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

207
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,762
Four.

208
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,348
Two left, huh?

209
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,057
I ....

210
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,146
Can you help me?

211
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,317
Could you tell her
that I wanna take her to dinner?

212
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,028
Right.

213
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,909
It's hot.

214
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,393
That's just ....

215
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,196
Just eat it?

216
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,495
It's cooling it down.

217
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,726
It's hot again. It's really hot.

218
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,274
Oh, the whole thing.

219
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,655
Yeah, that's better.

220
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,885
No, you don't pull the trigger.

221
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,845
Squeeze it.

222
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,684
- It's yours.
- What?

223
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,061
Congratulations.

224
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,976
What --? Where --?

225
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,647
Okay.

226
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,515
- Boss.
- Yeah?

227
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:13,519
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

228
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,982
Be at the Chao Phraya ferry station
in 20 minutes.

229
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,318
- Okay, boss.
- Wait for my call.

230
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,861
Done, boss.

231
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:30,036
Okay, listen carefully. Open the case.
Sixty-five, 32, 15.

232
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,538
Put the cell phone in the case
and leave it.

233
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,207
Got it.

234
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,923
The case has returned.

235
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,738
- Yes.
- Put your boss on.

236
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,544
- Yes.
- We had an arrangement.

237
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,506
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

238
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,267
We'll try again.

239
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,583
You, what is your work?

240
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,546
Banking.

241
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,882
Banker.

242
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,051
- Banker. Yes.
- Banker. Banker.

243
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,023
Rain.

244
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,946
Rain ...

245
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,326
... is you? Your name means "rain"?

246
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,749
This is your name.

247
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,682
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

248
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,394
Floating market?
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

249
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,564
Ratchaburi province.
Hour and a half by car.

250
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,114
Get some sleep.

251
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,992
We leave early.

252
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,640
Dock the boat up on the right.

253
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,528
Hey, mister, you buy something?
Buy something?

254
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,336
Get us out of here. Get us out.

255
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,843
Dock the boat on the left.

256
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,346
Come on, faster. Hurry up.

257
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,129
Get me over there.

258
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,923
Fuck!

259
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,085
No. No.

260
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,397
Take it to the club.

261
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,941
He same like you, you know.

262
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,610
- Who?
- This guy on TV.

263
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,658
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

264
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,703
Thai people love him.

265
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,165
He's a very good man.

266
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,711
Same like you, aajaan.

267
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,002
Four: Know when it's time to get out.

268
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,389
Three: Erase every trace.

269
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,145
Boss.

270
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:47,901
Two: Don't take an interest in people
outside of work.

271
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,626
One: Don't ask questions.

272
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,590
He's a very good man.

273
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,551
Same like you.

274
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,774
Political assassination
wasn't in the contract ...

275
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,235
... so there are two ways to go:

276
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,571
Refuse the job and walk away now ...

277
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,159
... or do the job and walk away rich.

278
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:26,583
The truth is almost anyone
can take out a politician.

279
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,752
That's not the hard part.

280
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:32,338
The hard part is getting away with it.

281
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,231
Kong.

282
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,863
Be here tomorrow at 6 p.m.

283
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:23,908
Last job?

284
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,452
- Yeah.
- Bad man?

285
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,788
Bad for somebody.

286
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,583
See you tomorrow, boss.

287
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,669
Talk.

288
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,815
Aom?

289
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,203
Kong!

290
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,480
Aom!

291
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,824
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

292
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,244
Thai people love him.

293
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:30,394
When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate ...

294
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:33,397
... you don't think, you just run.

295
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,066
Anyone in the way goes down.

296
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,527
It's pretty simple: You're the target now.

297
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:42,114
Leave the country
or you're going to die.

298
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,719
Why the fuck you care?

299
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:29,346
He's my student.

300
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:49,241
-- but they seem to be running away
from any possible danger.

301
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,880
Kong.

302
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:43,150
I had to tell them.

303
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,076
Take her to the street.

304
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:54,494
I cleared a way.

305
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:57,080
I got one more job.

306
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:58,415
Surat?

307
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,168
He's very bad.
