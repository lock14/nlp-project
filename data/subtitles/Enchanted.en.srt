00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,933
Once upon a time, in
a magical kingdom known as Andalasia,

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,811
there lived an evil queen.

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,438
Selfish and cruel,

4
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:08,025
she lived in fear that one day
her stepson would marry,

5
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,070
and she would
lose her throne forever.

6
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:16,701
And so, she did all in her power
to prevent the prince from ever meeting

7
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:22,707
the one special maiden with whom
he would share true love's kiss.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,002
Giselle, Giselle,
how about this for your statue?

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,255
- Oh, this will be perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,092
Come on! OK, you mookses, move it!
We have got a face to put together here

11
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,720
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

12
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,264
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

13
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,350
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

14
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,894
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

15
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,354

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,274

00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,098
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

177
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,226
a friendly "hello" or even a smile,

178
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,021
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

179
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,527
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

180
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,864
Oh! Where are you going?

181
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:31,036
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

182
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,624
You! Come back here!
I need that!

183
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,292
Oh! Please?

184
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,461
You...

185
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,214
...are not a very nice old man!

186
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,269
No way you're getting him,
Ethan.

187
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,690
- You want him because I want him.
- I'm not letting you have him!

188
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,526
- Forget it. Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

189
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,237
- I'm getting confused. Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

190
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,824
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

191
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,659
A baseball card?

192
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,037
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

193
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,622
You never loved Hank like me.

194
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,500
- You never loved me like Hank!
- How did I make you so angry?

195
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,584
- Robert?
- Yes?

196
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,837
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

197
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,506
- It's a longer list!
- What would you do if you...?

198
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,467
I have to pick up my daughter.
Can we do this around 9:00?

199
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,178
- 9:00 sounds good.
- Great. I'll see you then.

200
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,180
Phoebe, I'll see you in the morning, OK?

201
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,224
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

202
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,101
- I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

203
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,937
After a whole day of that,
you still want to get engaged?

204
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,606
Those people got married
on a crazy romantic whim.

205
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,400
It's not like that with Nancy and l.

206
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,194
Right. None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?

207
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,362
Oh, come on.

208
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,698
I mean, we're rational.

209
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,451
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

210
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,454
Sounds like building a bridge.
Have you told your daughter?

211
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,788
No, I haven't. Not yet.

212
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm going to tonight.
I got a present to ease her into it.

213
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,128
With news like this, I hope you
got her a Shetland pony.

214
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,672
No. Something much better than that.

215
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,764
- A book?
- Oh, come on. Don't give me that look.

216
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,392
I know it's not that fairy tale book
you wanted, but this is better.

217
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,604
Look at this. See?
Rosa Parks.

218
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,813
Madame Curie.

219
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:26,485
She was a remarkable woman who
dedicated her life to research...

220
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,237
...until she died from...

221
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,075
- ...radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

222
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,328
I wonder who that is.

223
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
Yeah, hi.

224
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,417
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

225
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,378
- With her now?
- Yes, let me call you later.

226
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,839
All right. Bye-bye.

227
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,717
It was Nancy.

228
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,345
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,932
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

230
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,185
Sweetie...

231
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,314
...I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

232
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,609
- What?
- Yeah, you like her, don't you?

233
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,194
We all get along.

234
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,030
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

235
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,865
Do I have to give up my bedroom?

236
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,743
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

237
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,871
Come on, it's going to be great.
I promise.

238
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,208
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

239
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,961
- Stepmother.
- She's gonna be a nice stepmother.

240
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,964
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow, just you and her,

241
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,091
for some grown-up girl-bonding time.

242
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,551
I'm only six.

243
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,303
You won't always be.

244
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,921
Hello!

245
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,216
It's me, Giselle, from Andalasia.

246
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,971
Hello!

247
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,349
Is there anybody home?

248
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,934
Hello, please open the door.

249
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,604
It's very cold out here.

250
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,357
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

251
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,443
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

252
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,779
- She's really there!
- No, she's not. What are you doing?

253
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,365
Get back in here! Stop!

254
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,117
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

255
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,702
- Princess!
- Morgan!

256
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,455
- Don't you ever do that again!
- Look! Look!

257
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,958
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

258
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,044
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

259
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,130
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

260
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,425
I was wondering if maybe you...
Whoa!

261
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,302
Hang on!

262
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,305
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

263
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,557
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

264
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,856
Catch her, Daddy!

265
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,528
- Oh!
- Ow!

266
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,657
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

267
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,785
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

268
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,081
- What were you doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

269
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,000
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

270
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,002
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

271
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,964
Yeah, well, welcome to New York.

272
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,424
Thank you.

273
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,302
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

274
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,514
- Oh, yes.
- You need me to call somebody for you?

275
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,183
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

276
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,019
What?

277
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,192
Morgan, show her the way, please.

278
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,779
And then
the old hag told me to...

279
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,657
Oh! ...Look into the well
and wish for my heart's desire.

280
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,076
But I must have looked very far

281
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,830
because I fell,
down, down, down.

282
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,082
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

283
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,043
and I got very lost,
until I fell off of the castle.

284
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,088
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit of yours?

285
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,256
Falling off stuff?

286
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,842
Well, usually someone catches me.

287
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,388
But, not to worry, I'm certain that
Edward is already searching for me.

288
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,434
No doubt by morning he'll come
and rescue me from this strange land.

289
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,563
Take me home, and the two of us
can share in true love's kiss.

290
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,689
True love's kiss?

291
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,233
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

292
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,319
Right.

293
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,238
Now if I could only find a place
to rest my head for the night.

294
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,365
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

295
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,327
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

296
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,911
A hollow tree?

297
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,248
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're very hospitable.

298
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,044
All I can do is let you in for a minute.
Dry off, use the phone if you want to.

299
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,629
We have our own bedtime
to stick to. Let's go.

300
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,466
That's very kind of you.

301
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,388
- What is it with this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

302
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,390
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk

303
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,769
from my silkworms and I spun it
into thread on my spinning wheel.

304
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,147
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits

305
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,857
did help with the sewing.

306
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,110
- They're good!
- Oh!

307
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,862
Whoa!

308
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,078
Why don't we see about
getting you a car.

309
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,292
- Couldn't she sleep here, Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

310
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,344
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

311
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,429
But...

312
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,391
...I will be soon.

313
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,319
Wow, Dad.
She's really sleepy.

314
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,948
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

315
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,992
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

316
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,327
I want you to go to bed.

317
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,871
But I think she might be
a real princess.

318
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:16,626
Morgan, just because she has on a funny
dress, doesn't mean she's a princess.

319
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,463
She is a seriously confused woman
who's fallen into our laps.

320
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,800
- So we're not going to let her stay?
- No.

321
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,261
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

322
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,762
Good night, OK?

323
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,313
Hi. I need a car
at 116th and Riverside, please.

324
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,607
- Hold, please.
- Thank you.

325
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:55,665
Hello, sir.
Destination, please.

326
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,333
Sir?

327
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,849
- Morgan.
- What?

328
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,726
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

329
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,728
- Why?
- Just come on.

330
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,688
All right.

331
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,240
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

332
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,995
Yeah, but who's
gonna rescue me?

333
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,166
- All right, let's close it up.
- Whoa!

334
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,920
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

335
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,338
Guys, I got it.

336
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,924
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

337
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,301
Are you in league with
the wicked old hag who sent

338
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,387
my poor Giselle
to this foul place, Arty?

339
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:59,270
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

340
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,243
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

341
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,954
Speechless in my presence.

342
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,248
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

343
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,251
- What are you talking about?
- I seek a beautiful girl.

344
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,461
My other half,
my one coquette,

345
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,213
the answer
to my love's duet.

346
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,048
I'd like to
find one of them too.

347
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,301
Then keep a wary eye out, Arty.

348
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,887
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

349
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,681
Hey!

350
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,893
Hey! Get off the car, you nut!

351
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,395
Did you see that chipmunk?

352
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,345
Oh, my.

353
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,681
This just won't do.

354
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,991
Whoa!

355
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,219
Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

356
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,222
Oh.

357
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,684
Hello.

358
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,687
Oh...

359
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:14,238
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

360
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,575

Wasn't this fun?

- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

398
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,038
- Wake up!
- What is it?

399
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,624
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

400
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,542
I can't tell you.
You have to come see!

401
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,044
What's wrong? Are you OK?

402
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:37,715
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

403
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,137
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

404
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,059
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.

405
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,811
- Get rid of them.
- Put them back?

406
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,021
Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

407
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,397
Open the door!

408
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,402
Good! Watch out!

409
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,626
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

410
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,419
Shh. Stay there.

411
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,880
- Hello.
- Come in!

412
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:23,010
- Yeah, can l...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

413
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:27,098
Oh! That's too thoughtful of you.

414
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,768
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

415
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:35,439
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

416
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,275
Where does the water come from?

417
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,946
Uh, well, the water comes
from the pipes.

418
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,450
- And where do the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

419
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:51,122
- ...wherever the pipes get it.
- Oh.

420
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,832
It is magical.

421
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,299
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

422
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,926
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

423
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,720
Kick what?

424
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,638
Why do you still have your PJ's on?

425
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,182
It's been pretty busy around here.

426
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,937
Wow.
It's really neat in here.

427
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:19,400
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

428
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

429
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:26,824
Oh!

430
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,453
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

431
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,496
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

432
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,290
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

433
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,500
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

434
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,169
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

435
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,546
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

436
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,799
- She was lost. I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

437
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,344
The shower.
The shower is wonderful, Nancy.

438
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,846
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough. Thank you.

439
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:51,807
- Calm down. Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

440
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,352
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,

441
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,021
Morgan's here, and you have
to maintain boundaries

442
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,357
and I thought,
"I'm so lucky. He's sensitive!"

443
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,151
I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.

444
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,819
- We'll talk.
- Don't bet on it.

445
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,114
What about taking Morgan?
Some grown-up girl-bonding time.

446
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,993
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

447
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,704
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

448
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,789
Goodbye!

449
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,210
Oh, she is lovely.

450
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,213
Get dressed, please.
For school.

451
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,548
Just... Please.

452
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,886
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

453
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,846
Nancy, wait!

454
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,270
- Hello?
- You got to go.

455
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,857
I don't know what your deal is,
if you're waiting for Prince Charming...

456
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,734
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

457
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,278
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

458
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:49,657
and then that's it!
I can't get involved after that.

459
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,288
What is this?

460
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,250
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

461
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,501
Do you like it?

462
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,255
You're unhappy.

463
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,424
You made a dress out of my curtains?

464
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,260
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

465
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,179
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

466
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,598
It's an unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

467
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,893
- I have heard of it, but l...
- You have created a completely

468
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,355
unnecessary problem with Nancy.
That I now have to resolve.

469
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,774
See, the fact is,
I was just getting ready

470
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,360
to take a very serious step forward.

471
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,571
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

472
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,032
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and l...

473
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,369
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

474
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,622
Oh, no.

475
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,208
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

476
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,170
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

477
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,798
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

478
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:52,303
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

479
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,973
And then she'll know for sure.

480
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,102
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know.

481
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,397
It's like you escaped from
a Hallmark card or something.

482
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,567
Is that a bad thing?

483
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,112
School! We're late!
We've got to run!

484
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,281
Oh!

485
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:22,249
Oh, wouldn't she just love to come
crawling back here and steal my crown!

486
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:26,170
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

487
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,423
Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.

488
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,842
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

489
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,016
Oh...

490
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:44,355
Oh! I do wish there was someone
who cared enough for me

491
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,274
to go after him.

492
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,030
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

493
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,951
I'd do anything for him.

494
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,203
Never fear, my queen.

495
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,623
I will stop him!

496
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,467
- What now?
- Another one?

497
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,428
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

498
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,264
Where are these people coming from?

499
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,807
- Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

500
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,768
Get him up.

501
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,562
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

502
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,023
Let me guess. You're, uh,
looking for a beautiful girl too.

503
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,859
No.

504
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,236
I'm looking for a prince, actually.

505
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,991
Right.

506
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,581
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

507
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,344
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

508
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,889
Drat!

509
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,475
The steel beast is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

510
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,395
- Move that bus!
- Come on, already!

511
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,481
- Get that bus out of there!
- Are you crazy?

512
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,902
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

513
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,612
Do you hear me?

514
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,864
- You get down here!
- If you'll allow me...

515
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,618
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I suggest that you...

516
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:24,288
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

517
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,291
Come here and mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

518
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,628
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

519
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,923
A rat!
Get it away from me!

520
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,634
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

521
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:41,055
Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere

522
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,723
for your bride?

523
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,911
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

524
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,579
It's just a statue!

525
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,415
Come quickly. Quickly.

526
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,293
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

527
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,962
- Mrs. Banks is here.
- Great.

528
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,588
With Mr. Banks and his lawyer.

529
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,674
- Perfect, how long?
- Do you want to know?

530
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,343
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

531
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,844
- See this girl?
- Who is she?

532
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,305
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

533
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,557
- What do I do?
- Find out where she's from,

534
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,851
and get her there.
And make sure it's cheap.

535
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,812
If Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.

536
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,814
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

537
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,191
I have a meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

538
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,402
Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.

539
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,028
- Yes? Hi.
- Stay out of trouble.

540
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,326
Oh... Oh.

541
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,247
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

542
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,882
Your Majesty.

543
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,760
- Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

544
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,681
Nathaniel, here!

545
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,726
Nathaniel!

546
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:16,108
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here.

547
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,737
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't, My Lady.

548
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,032
Time is of the essence.

549
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,035
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

550
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,078
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

551
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,499
No, he shan't. I intend to make
absolutely certain of that.

552
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,377
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

553
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:41,342
...ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

554
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:46,013
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

555
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,641
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

556
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:54,897
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

557
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,232
- Hmm?
- Happily...

558
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:00,778
...ever after?
Oh, My Lady.

559
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,030
Mmm, yes.
It won't be difficult.

560
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,658
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

561
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:10,829
One small bite to drag her down

562
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,708
into a deep and troubled sleep.

563
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,252
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

564
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,798
that precious little pretender
to my throne

565
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,966
will be gone!

566
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,387
It shall be done, My Lady.

567
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,472
- I swear it.
- Yes.

568
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,850
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

569
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,353
Your Majesty?

570
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,817
Hello.

571
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,693
You little...

572
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,987
Whoa! Hey!

573
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,334
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please. I beg of you.

574
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,921
Don't listen to that
insane little vermin.

575
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,006
He's probably eaten some bad nuts.

576
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,050
We should put him down
for his own good.

577
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,844
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

578
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,013
But, sire! No. He's delirious.
He came to tell all sorts of...

579
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,312
Go ahead, Pip.

580
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,065
What is it you want to say?

581
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,776
You watch me. OK?

582
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,780
Nathaniel?

583
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,366
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

584
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:33,203
- Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
- No, no, no.

585
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,123
Hmm... Oh!

586
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,766
Oh, oh, oh!
I know this.

587
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,769
- Uh...
- Apple?

588
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,521
No, thank you.

589
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,064
It's good.

590
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,609
Oh, OK.

591
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,906
Ta-da!

592
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,164
You feel you'd die without me here.

593
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,294
Yes. Here we go. Good.

594
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,255
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

595
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,716
There's no reason not
to be reasonable.

596
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,928
Great. We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

597
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,555
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars for a second.

598
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,182
- Sorry.
- What? What?

599
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,559
She has no driver's license.
No passport.

600
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,436
Can't find this place she comes from.

601
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,687
- What place?
- Andalusia.

602
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,980
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

603
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,982
I've called every travel agent.

604
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,276
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

605
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,446
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

606
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,407
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

607
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,577
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

608
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:02,125
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

609
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,753
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

610
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,631
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

611
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,592
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain he already knows.

612
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:14,221
- Excuse me?
- Are you him?

613
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,392
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

614
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,478
- It's no wonder you're in love.
- I got it!

615
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,731
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

616
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,818
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

617
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,362
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

618
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,198
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

619
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,950
- Yeah.
- For how long?

620
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,161
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

621
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,039
Shh. Yes.

622
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,792
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

623
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,961
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

624
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,963
- She's not.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

625
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,757
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

626
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,218
What kind of an operation
are you running here?

627
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,886
This is so unprofessional.

628
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,514
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

629
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,017
if you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

630
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,853
you can throw this whole deal out.

631
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,982
What is going on here?
Who's she?

632
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,568
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

633
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,821
You begged me to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

634
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,032
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

635
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,326
And some girl is crying
like we're on Oprah.

636
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,704
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

637
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,165
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

638
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,876
Yes, you. This whole Kumbaya,
Up With People routine.

639
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,795
- Those people are in real pain.
- Of course they're in pain.

640
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,255
They're separated forever.

641
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,382
Married one day
and the next they're not.

642
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,010
- What sort of awful place is this?
- It's reality.

643
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,346
Well, I think I'd prefer to be
in Andalasia.

644
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,223
- I think I'd prefer that too.
- Get in, please.

645
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,230
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

646
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,276
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

647
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,071
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

648
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,323
Where do you suppose I should look?

649
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,753
Look, sire! Over there!

650
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,254
Ah! Giselle!

651
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,258
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose!

652
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,512
- Giselle!
- I try to do the right thing.

653
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,138
Oh, you've been very nice to me.

654
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:24,267
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

655
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,436
- I can't help you anymore. OK?
- What?

656
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,190
Here's some money. I want you
to take it. Call your prince.

657
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,109
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

658
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,986
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

659
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,448
- Robert?
- Just go.

660
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,826
I'm so sorry.

661
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,745
You have been a very kind friend
to me when I had none.

662
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,250
And I would never want to make you
unhappy or cause you any trouble, so...

663
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,712
...I'll go.

664
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:56,383
I wish you every happiness.

665
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,991
You have lovely friends.

666
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,286
Would you like to feed
the birds? Just a dollar a bag.

667
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,329
Certainly.

668
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,165
By chance,
have you seen my prince?

669
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,208
He was here.

670
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,086
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

671
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,630
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

672
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,800
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,302
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

674
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,763
He was on the bus this morning.

675
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,516
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

676
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,976
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

677
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,687
- You can't just give people money.
- You gave me money.

678
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:54,024
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

679
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,109
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

680
00:44:56,194 --> 00:45:00,113
- How long you two been together?
- Oh, about a day.

681
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,783
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

682
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:06,661
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

683
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,371
- One day?
- Yes.

684
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,833
- And tomorrowwill be two days.
- You're joking.

685
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,710
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

686
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,378
But I'm not.

687
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:19,007
You're gonna marry somebody after a day
because you fell in love with him?

688
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,593
Yes.

689
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,220

00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,811
Oh! Ooh!

691
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,815
I don't get it. How can you talk
about loving some guy

692
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,068
- you don't even know?
- Well, I knowwhat's in his heart.

693
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,529
Oh, OK. Great.

694
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,739
This was so yummy.

695
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,075
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

696
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,410

- What about you?

698
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,835
- How long have you known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

699
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,671
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. l...

700
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,256
Well, no wonder she's angry.

701
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,550
Hello, nice lady.

707
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,525

709

711
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,373
Shut up.

712
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,626
Most normal people get to know
each other before they get married.

713
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,920
They date.

714
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,172
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

715
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,342
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

716
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,471
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

717
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,683
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

718
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,227
About yourself.
About your interests.

719
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,521
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

720
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,316
You have such strange
ideas about love.

721
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,069
Maybe we should do what you would do.
You meet, have lunch, and get married.

722
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,155
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

723
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,532
Forget "happily ever after."
it doesn't exist.

724
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,910
Well, of course it does.
Oh!

725
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,995
Oh!

726
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,081
I hate to disagree,
but marriages are a success

727
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,416
if they manage not to end.

728
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,294

- What about you and Nancy?

729

live happily ever after.

730

through today, let alone a lifetime.

Wait, sire!
Go back! Go back! Please!

836
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,935

It's love that makes me
act this crazy.

840
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:52,038
This isn't love.
This is infatuation.

847
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,571
Aw. Maybe you'd like to snuggle
in a nice little nook

848
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,407
for the night, eh?

849
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,590
Night-night.

850
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,846
Sleep tight.

851
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,557
I think I need some air, sire.

852
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:59,063
I don't like them sad endings.

853
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,068
Sire.

854
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,196
Do you...

855
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,614
...like yourself?

856
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,201
What's not to like?

857
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,546
Where'd he go?

858
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,926
♪ When the moon hits your eye

859
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,720
♪ Like a big pizza pie...

860
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,264
Oh, yeah. Here.
Watch this.

861
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,101
Watch very carefully. I'm gonna
put it in this hand like that.

862
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,938
Oh, do it again! Show me!
That's wonderful.

863
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,106
- Show me again!
- All right. Last time.

864
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,566
There you go. There it is.

865
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,360
And look.

866
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,364
You're a wizard!

867
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,494
What?

868
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,039
- This is a very nice place.
- Yeah.

869
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,959
- And we're eating dinner?
- Yeah.

870
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,586
- This is a date.
- Yeah.

871
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:49,215
No! No! No, no. We're just...

872
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,300
We're just friends.

873
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:55,304
Besides, people don't usually
bring their children on dates.

874
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,723
That's too bad.

875
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,435
Morgan's a lovely girl.
She's very kind and very sweet.

876
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,479
Yeah. She's great.

877
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:10,278
- What?
- Does she miss her terribly?

878
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,154
- Miss who?
- Her mother.

879
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,573
Um...

880
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,867
- Well, we just...
- What?

881
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,330
- We don't talk about it.
- Oh.

882
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,583
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

883
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,835
No, no. It's OK.
It's just...

884
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:32,008
I don't talk about it...
to Morgan or to anybody.

885
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,511
- Because it was very sad?
- Not at first.

886
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:39,307
- You were in love.
- Yeah.

887
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,601
Yeah.

888
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,687
- That was the problem.
- How could that be a problem?

889
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,399
Because love... The lovey-dovey
version that you talk about?

890
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,568
It's fantasy.

891
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,112
And one day,
you have to wake up and...

892
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,117
- ...you're in the real world.
- What made you wake up?

893
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,621
Well...

894
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,584
...she left.

895
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:12,548
- I'm so sorry for you both.
- It's OK.

896
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,343
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it.

897
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,136
It's her I worry about, though.

898
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,057
I know she's shy. I know she
doesn't have very many friends.

899
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,142
I just want her to be strong,
you know?

900
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,062
To be able to face
the world for what it is.

901
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,356
That's why I don't
encourage the fairy tales.

902
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,524
I don't want to set her up

903
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,361
to believe in this
"dreams come true" nonsense.

904
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,738
But dreams do come true.

905
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,532
And maybe something
wonderful will happen.

906
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,994
Yeah, well, I forgot
who I was talking to.

907
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,789
Well, I hope you don't forget.

908
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:45,998
I like talking to you.

909
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,751
For the nice lady.

910
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,878
From a secret admirer.

911
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,255
How come people keep
giving you free stuff?

912
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,927
- What is it?
- It's an apple martini, miss.

913
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,429
Apple mar... Ooh!
It looks yummy.

914
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,723
Be careful. It's poisonous.

915
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,519
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

916
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,106
They'll creep up on you.
I'd be careful.

917
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:15,069
- Well, I'll just have one sip.
- A sip is all it takes.

918
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,445
Oh.

919
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,283
- Hi-yah!
- Oh!

920
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,952
You miserable...

921
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,788
There's a rodent on the table!
Can we get some help here?

922
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,790
He's telling me something!

923
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,252
Pip, you're here! Oh!

924
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,131
- It's chewing off her face!
- A chipmunk!

925
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,133
That thing's loaded with disease.

926
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,968
Edward is here!

927
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,722
- Edward is here!
- I'll save you, miss!

928
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,515
Oh, my! Pip?

929
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,184
- Okey-dokey.
- Duck!

930
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,648
Let me see your face.

931
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:56,694
I'm fine!
Pip wouldn't scratch me! No!

932
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,990
- Where's Pip? Where is he?
- The pizza's breathing!

933
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,745
Oh! Pip!

934
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,175
Oh, no.

935
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,386
Pip.

936
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:24,388
What's wrong? Are you OK?

937
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,016
Oh, Daddy.

938
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,860
Tell me magic mirror,
what is this awful place?

939
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,738
Why is everything so difficult?

940
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,157
Will I ever find my heart's duet?

941
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,827
Preliminary search of the pizza oven
did not reveal any rodent remains.

942
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,454
This animal's still out there.

943
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,081
Joining us is the woman
who was attacked

944
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,708
- by this chipmunk.
- Giselle!

945
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,502
Tell us, how does it feel

946
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,838
knowing this dangerous animal
is most likely still alive?

947
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,675
Wonderful! Pip is my very
best friend, and...

948
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,219
Giselle, why don't we go home?

949
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,554
I wasn't finished.
One more question, please.

950
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,306
What villainy is this?

951
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,392
Is this unprovoked attack
part of some new trend?

952
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,063
- Is rodent rage on the rise?
- Magic mirror, I beg you.

953
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,649
- Tell me where she is!
- From 116th and Broadway...

954
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:21,237
116th and Broadway!
Thank you, mirror.

955
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,405
...I'm Mary llene Caselotti.

956
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,201
My goodness. We sure
had a lot of excitement tonight.

957
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,079
- Were you scared earlier?
- A little bit.

958
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,623
But do you
think Pip will be OK?

959
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,959
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Pip.

960
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,044
He is very brave.

961
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,881
I remember this one time
when the poor wolf

962
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,967
was being chased by
Little Red Riding Hood

963
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:47,137
around his grandmother's house
and she had an axe. Oh.

964
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,223
And if Pip hadn't
been walking by to help,

965
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,976
I don't know
what would've happened.

966
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,979
I don't really
remember that version.

967
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,982
Well, that's because Red
tells it a little differently.

968
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,067
Good night, Giselle.

969
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,111
And thank you for the nice story.

970
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,988
Good night, Morgan.

971
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,562
Ma'am! You cannot
let your dog do that here!

972
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,093
You're too late.

973
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,055
My apologies.

974
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,793
Oh, Giselle!

975
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,970
Look, uh, Giselle.

976
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,516
That was a nice story about
your chipmunk friend and all.

977
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,726
Yes.

978
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,729
I know what it's like
when someone disappoints you.

979
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,023
It's tempting to see things
the way you wish

980
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,235
- instead of how they are.
- I don't wish that he's coming, Robert.

981
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,319
He is.

982
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,905
Right.
Because the chipmunk told you.

983
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,074
Yes. Pip actually said...

984
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,243
Knowwhat? I don't
know if you're kidding

985
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,705
or being ironic,
because chipmunks don't talk.

986
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,373
Well, not here they don't.

987
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,000
So in lieu of taking advice
from a forest rodent,

988
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,253
I just wanted to say that, uh...

989
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,715
...if it did work out and you
decided to stay in New York,

990
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:31,301
- I'd like to help.
- That's very kind of you, Robert.

991
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,096
- But Edward is coming for me.
- But what if he doesn't?

992
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,931
Why do you keep saying that?

993
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,267
Because I deal with this every day.

994
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,936
If a relationship
has issues at the beginning,

995
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,022
- it doesn't get any better.
- He is coming!

996
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,234
Giselle, I don't think so. No.

997
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,446
- Yes!
- I have to disagree. No.

998
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,114
- No?
- No.

999
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,534
Is that the only word that you know? No?

1000
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,162
- No!
- Oh, yeah? No.

1001
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:03,125
- No. I mean, no.
- No! No! Over and over again!

1002
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,837
Every word out of your mouth
is "no"! It makes me so...

1003
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,548
- Sometimes you make me so...
- I make you so what?

1004
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,425
You make me so...

1005
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,051
So...

1006
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,973
...angry!

1007
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,185
- I'm angry!
- Are you all right?

1008
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:26,023
- I'm angry. I'm angry!
- Are you OK?

1009
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,399
I'm...

1010
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,986
I'm wonderful.

1011
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,908
Are you sure?

1012
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,036
Yes. I'm...

1013
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,539
I'm fine.

1014
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,003
I'm...

1015
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,922
...fit as a fiddle.

1016
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,888
OK.

1017
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,769
Good night.

1018
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,116
Oh, my.

1019
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,496
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

1020
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,415
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1021
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,419
Morning. Made breakfast.
Great.

1022
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,087
I'll get it.

1023
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,505
Thank you.

1024
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,176
- That's a nice dress.
- Thank you.

1025
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,512
It is I! Prince Edward of Andalasia,

1026
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,223
come to rescue my lovely bride,
the fair Giselle!

1027
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,225
- He's here.
- Apparently.

1028
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,853
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

1029
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:32,441
- Oh, um, how do I look?
- Slightly stunned.

1030
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,862
- No. I mean, how do I look?
- You look...

1031
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,072
...beautiful.

1032
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:45,120
- Giselle!
- Edward!

1033
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:49,082
Ah!

1034
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,295
Could you...? I'm sorry.
But could you just be...?

1035
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,923
- Could you just be careful?
- You!

1036
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,175
- What?
- You're the one who's been

1037
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,886
- holding my Giselle captive!
- Let's stay calm.

1038
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,137
No!

1039
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:06,475
- Any last words before I dispatch you?
- You have got to be kidding me.

1040
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,060
Strange words.

1041
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,939
No! No! No.

1042
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,232
- These are my friends.
- Oh.

1043
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,818
This is Morgan.
And Robert.

1044
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,278
This is Edward.

Oh. I'm not.

Well, I'm sorry.

1056
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,156
- I was thinking.
- Thinking?

1057
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,201
Before we leave, there's one
thing I would love to do.

1058
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,870
Name it, my love,
and it is done.

1059
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:12,791
- I want to go on a date.
- A date!

1060
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,794
What's a date?

1061
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,463
Well...

1062
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,175
...we go out to dinner.

1063
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,428
And we talk about ourselves.

1064
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:29,057
Our likes and our dislikes.
Our interests.

1065
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,976
A date.

1066
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,734
And remember that you guys can come
and visit Andalasia anytime.

1067
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,861
Sure. And if you ever come to town,

1068
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,530
we should all get together for dinner.

1069
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,323
That would be lovely.

1070
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,787
We'll see each other soon.

1071
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:53,749
It's not like we're talking
about, you know,

1072
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,002
- forever.
- And ever.

1073
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,880
So, uh...

1074
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,509
...good luck on your date.

1075
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,723
Oh, and you with Nancy.

1076
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:17,856
And you. It was so nice
spending time with you.

1077
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,029
I'll never forget you.
You know that.

1078
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,532
Yeah?

1079
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,288
Thank you for taking care
of my bride, peasants.

1080
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,173
I'm going to really miss her.

1081
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,717
Me, too, sweetheart.

1082
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,223
Me too.

1083
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:05,529
I don't know how they found
each other, Your Majesty.

1084
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,656
- I really don't.
- You idiot!

1085
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,827
- But, Your Majesty...
- I sent you to kill her, not save her.

1086
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:16,414
- Can't you get that straight?
- I realize you're upset, madam.

1087
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,167
But if you could find a way
to give me one more chance.

1088
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,045
Another chance? Do you think
poison apples grow on trees?

1089
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:26,007
There's only one left!
You are out of chances!

1090
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,301
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- No, forget it!

1091
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:33,515
I'm coming there! And I will
kill the little wretch myself!

1092
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,684
Oh, pooh.

1093
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:51,700
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

1094
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:55,537
I mean, it's the first thing
I noticed when we met.

1095
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,372
- It's true.
- Mm.

1096
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:01,877
- Her eyes really do sparkle.
- Ethan.

1097
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,587
OK, look. Look.

1098
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,381
As your attorney, Phoebe,

1099
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,426
you can't let a chance encounter
with someone...

1100
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,719
What if it wasn't chance?

1101
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,305
What if it was no accident,
us meeting her.

1102
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,641
- You guys had problems.
- Everybody has problems.

1103
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,435
Everybody has bad times.

1104
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,314
Do we sacrifice all of the good
times because of them?

1105
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,065
No.

1106
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:43,043
How did you like your hot dog?

1107
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,963
Oh! It's not really a dog. They just
call it a hot dog here.

1108
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,303
- It's quite excellent.
- Good.

1109
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,265
Well! This has been a splendid date.

1110
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,393
- Shall we go?
- Go where?

1111
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:03,021
Back to Andalasia, of course.
To be married.

1112
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,607
To live happily ever after
forever and ever.

1113
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:10,695
Oh. Well, we don't have
to go right away.

1114
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:16,326
How long do these dates usually last?

1115
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,078
Oh, well...

1116
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,498
They can go as long as you want, really.

1117
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,708
They can just keep going and going,

1118
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,962
just so long as you keep thinking
about activities that you can do.

1119
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,923
- Activities?
- We could go to the museum.

1120
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:33,510
Or to the theater?

1121
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:37,305
- Or there's this ball.
- A ball?

1122
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,015
Yes.

1123
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,142
There's dancing and music.

1124
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,812
- You like that.
- Well, I suppose.

1125
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,647
Oh, wonderful.
We should go then.

1126
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,358
- Giselle?
- Yes?

1127
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:52,988
- And then home to Andalasia?
- Of course.

1128
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,823
The moment it's over.

1129
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:01,246
Giselle! You're back!
You're back!

1130
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,166
Oh, Morgan. Oh!
Morgan, I need your help.

1131
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:09,212
I'm going to the ball, and I'm not sure
what to do, or what I should wear.

1132
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,257
I don't knowwhere to find
a fairy godmother at this late hour.

1133
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,094
I have something better
than a fairy godmother.

1134
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,766
Daddy says it's only for emergencies.

1135
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,686
This is definitely an emergency.

1136
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,033
Here you go,
you get to carry the bag.

1137
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,785
- Bye.
- Bye.

1138
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,412
Next.

1139
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:56,801
- Miss?
- Oh. Thank you.

1140
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,386
Have a good day.

1141
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:05,435
And when you go out, you don't
want to wear too much makeup.

1142
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,021
'Cause otherwise
the boys get the wrong idea.

1143
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,857
And you know how they are.

1144
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,234
They're only after one thing.

1145
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,404
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1146
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,947
Nobody will tell me.

1147
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,075
Oh.

1148
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,245
So is this what it's like?

1149
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,248
- What, sweetie?
- Going shopping with your mother?

1150
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,002
Oh, I don't know. I've never
been shopping with my mother.

1151
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,046
Me either.

1152
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,049
- But I like it.
- Me too.

1153
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,427
And just think.
Soon, you'll have a new mother.

1154
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,513
You mean stepmother.

1155
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,890
It's not true what they say.

1156
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:47,769
I have met so many kind
and wonderful stepmothers.

1157
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,188
Edward has a stepmother.

1158
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,733
I've never met her,
but I hear she's just lovely.

1159
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:35,692
Mr. N is on the line telling us
his sweetie pie is acting distant.

1160
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,193
You were saying, Mr. N?

1161
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,654
I've always treated her like a queen,

1162
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,532
but lately I'm starting to feel

1163
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,369
there's this whole other side to her,
like I don't even know her anymore.

1164
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,998
I think you need
to take her aside

1165
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:54,836
and find out how she
really feels about you.

1166
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,089
Hello, worthless.
Miss me?

1167
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:06,097
Reperio lemma miha!

1168
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,820
A-ha!

1169
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,420
- What is she doing here?
- I have no idea.

1170
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:23,967
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I'm surprised.

1171
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,553
- You said you couldn't dance.
- I said I didn't.

1172
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,556
I never said I couldn't.

1173
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,102
Oh. This is Edward.
He's my, um...

1174
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,939
- ...prince.
- And this is Nancy.

1175
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,024
She's... Well, she's...

1176
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,317
- We're together.
- Yes.

1177
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,948
And this beautiful lady is
Giselle, the love of my life.

1178
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,743
- My heart's true desire.
- Wow.

1179
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:53,788
- Is something wrong?
- Just the way you said that.

1180
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,958
So straightforward.
Not a hint of irony.

1181
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,128
It's very... romantic.

1182
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,963
Well, thank you.

1183
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,674
Well, folks,
it's that time of night.

1184
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:08,136
I'd like to ask each gentleman
to invite a lady

1185
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:14,058
he did not accompany this evening
to dance the King and Queen's Waltz.

1186
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:21,065
- May I have the pleasure?

1243
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:16,527

The magic will not work

1247
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:43,137

before the clock strikes 12.

1248
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,057
Hurry now. Hurry. Hurry.

1249
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,726
Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's it. That's it.

1250
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,395
Hurry. Hurry. Yes.

1251
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,719
Out of my way!

1252
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:28,849
How did she do that?

1253
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:40,194
Speciosus, formosus,

1254
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,947
praeclarus!

1255
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,659
- Ah!
- Edward?

1256
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,704
- Mother?
- Edward!

1257
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,999
Yes. Oh, her.

1258
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,960
I was taking her out for fresh air.

1259
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,713
She seems to have swooned.
Oh, leave her, darling.

1260
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,549
I think she's fine.
Just leave her. Slap her.

1261
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,551
Give her some water.
She's fine.

1262
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,929
- Someone help me, please!
- You're overreacting.

1263
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,014
You needn't get so upset, dear.
Really.

1264
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,852
Oh, no. Call 9-1-1.

1265
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,479
Don't pay any attention.
Go back to your party.

1266
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,149
- She's fine.
- Giselle.

1267
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,404
Hello, we have a woman
here, she's unconscious.

1268
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,239
I didn't see what happened.

1269
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:28,576
- She fainted. But she'll be fine...
- No, she didn't.

1270
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,037
Nathaniel, go back to the car.

1271
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,789
I will not.

1272
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:38,586
You poisoned her.

1273
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,755
- She's the evil hag, sire!
- You did this?

1274
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:45,342
She sent the girl here.
She poisoned her! With my help,

1275
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,929
- I regret to say.
- Oh, he's lying, darling.

1276
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:52,850
Why would I ever align myselfwith that
buffoon? I mean, think about it. Why...?

1277
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:57,897
Silence!
You lying, murderous wretch!

1278
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,941
When we return home, Andalasia
shall know of your treachery.

1279
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:05,613
- Your days as queen will be over!
- Take my crown?

1280
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,574
Don't you think that's
a bit melodramatic, dear?

1281
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,826
I don't know
what "melodramatic" means,

1282
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:14,121
but you'll be removed from the throne,
Narissa. I will see to it.

1283
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,552
That's enough from you, you viper.

1284
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,806
- We have to help her. What can we do?
- I don't know. What do we do?

1285
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,892
There's no way of helping her.
She's done for.

1286
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,523
True love's kiss.

1287
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,984
What?

1288
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,278
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

1289
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,905
Yes. Yes, of course.

1290
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,286
I knew that.

1291
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,971
It's not working!

1292
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:19,019
You'll never save her now.
When the clock strikes 12...

1293
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:21,272
...she'll be dead.

1294
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,484
- Unless...
- Unless?

1295
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,864
It's not possible.
It couldn't be me.

1296
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,492
- Don't you see?
- I've only known her for a few days.

1297
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,745
Kiss her, Robert. It's OK.

1298
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,591
Please.

1299
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,427
Don't leave me.

1300
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,249
I knew it was you.

1301
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,054
- What did you think?
- Wonderful.

1302
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,348
Oh, much better
than last year's show.

1303
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,101
No!

1304
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:48,776
The most powerful thing
in the world.

1305
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:53,030
Ha! I don't think so.

1306
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:57,451
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1307
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:01,955
You want a show?
I'll give you a show.

1308
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,292
Back up and get ready
for the main event!

1309
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:08,295
- You selfish, evil...
- Speciosus,

1310
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,049
formosus, praeclarus!

1311
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:29,316
All this nauseating talk of
"true love's kiss."

1312
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,985
it really does bring out
the worst in me.

1313
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,530
- Stay back.
- You know, I've been thinking.

1314
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:37,533
If I'm going to remain queen,
I'm going to need

1315
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,161
some sort of story
when I go back. Hmm.

1316
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:45,958
What if a giant,
vicious beast showed up

1317
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,627
and killed everyone?

1318
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:52,339
And poor, defenseless
Queen Narissa,

1319
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,675
she just couldn't save them.

1320
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:59,430
Let's begin with the girl
who started it all, shall we?

1321
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:03,225
- Over my dead body.
- All right.

1322
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:07,020
- I'm flexible.
- Let me go!

1323
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:13,444
Come along, Giselle. I don't
want you to miss this ending.

1324
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,382
Let me go!

1325
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,677
Ah! Put me down!
You're crazy!

1326
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:42,306
No, spiteful, vindictive, very large.

1327
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,559
But never crazy. Ah!

1328
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:51,231
- Giselle!
- Oh, my. This is a twist on our story!

1329
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:55,444
It's the brave little princess
coming to the rescue.

1330
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:59,406
I guess that makes you the damsel
in distress, huh, handsome?

1331
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:04,703
Keep up with me, dear. It's time
to take our tale to new heights!

1332
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,308
Pip!

1333
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:32,356
You'd like to finally be released...

1334
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,107
...to help Giselle...

1335
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,443
...to best the beast.

1336
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:38,445
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1337
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:42,199
Thank you.

1338
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,454
Narissa! I'm not going
to let you take him!

1339
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,041
We're coming to the end
of our story now.

1340
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,293
Are you at the edge
of your seat, Giselle,

1341
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:57,005
just dying to know how it ends?

1342
