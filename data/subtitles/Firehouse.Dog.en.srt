00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,446
<i>Stars.</i>

3
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,385
<i>From a distance,
they seem so mysterious,</i>

4
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,481
<i>so powerful, so perfect.</i>

5
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,855
<i>You'd never guess they're
really just big, bloated balls</i>

6
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,757
<i>of hot, smelly gas.</i>

7
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:57,354
<i>Unless, by some
freaky twist of fate,</i>

8
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,456
<i>you got close to one, like I did.</i>

9
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,001
<i>Because the star
I'm talking about is...</i>

10
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,335
<i>an actor,
an actor living in paradise.</i>

11
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:09,342
<i>So rich, so pampered,
so out of touch,</i>

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,138
<i>he forgot what real life was like.</i>

13
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,405
Waiting on talent!
Waiting on talent!

14
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,004
<i>- Or maybe, he never really knew.
Waiting on talent!</i>

15
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:19,051
Hey, Liz, what's up?

16
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,382
Time is up, Trey.

17
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:23,649
Is he coming out or not?

18
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:24,689
It's not looking good.

19
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,691
I mean, he's really depressed.

20
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,056
Why?

21
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:30,159
Come in.

22
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,355
But park the negativity
outside,

23
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,194
and I'll show you why.

24
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,234
Hmm?

25
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,298
A fleece?

26
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,538
A black-and-white spotted fleece?

27
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:50,205
I mean, one of your P.A.s
was wearing this.

28
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,839
So what?

29
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,076
It reminds him

30
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,311
of the girl that broke
his heart is so what.

31
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:58,355
And now he's in there, and he
can't think of anything else.

32
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,323
Trey, the director's furious.

33
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:02,858
The weather's getting dicey,

34
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:06,727
and the plane's been sitting
on the runway idling for hours.

35
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:09,765
It's his last skydiving shot, Trey.

36
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,428
There must be something
that I can do.

37
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:31,176
Rexxx...

38
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,687
Rexxx?

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,288
All he sees is Lola.

40
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,190
This is crazy, Trey.

41
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,093
He has to work.

42
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,960
Then you tell him.

43
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,160
Rexxx...

44
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,702
we are talking about your legacy.

45
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,204
That's right.

46
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,434
Your legacy.

47
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,372
Compared to you,
that Taco Bell dog

48
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:32,637
is just a footnote in history.

49
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,546
I had no idea that bugged him.

50
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,485
Let's get his tuxedo
and his props on.

51
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:45,955
Yes.

52
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:47,082
Let's shoot this thing, buddy.

53
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,921
Secret Agent
Dewey Branson

54
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:52,758
is ready for action.

55
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,661
Liz...

56
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:56,323
you're a miracle worker.

57
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,925
Thank you.

58
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,335
- MAN "A" camera's set.
"B" camera's good to go.

59
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:03,373
"C" and "D" cameras are ready.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,169
<i>But sometimes miracles...</i>

61
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:07,403
<i>Copy that.
- ... can turn into nightmares.</i>

62
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:11,473
...seven, take one, we have feed.

63
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,749
Oh, my God!

64
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,844
What happened?!

65
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,184
It's not my fault!

66
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,248
The lightning popped the chute
before I could strap it on!

67
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,125
Liz... Liz...

68
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,896
i- i-it's his.

69
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,129
We're close. We're close.

70
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,831
You guys look over there by that hill.

71
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,065
We have to keep looking.

72
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,631
Trey...

73
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,836
Trey, his hairpiece
could have landed

74
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,540
miles away from...
from the rest of him.

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,882
There are lakes and rivers
all over this place.

76
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,080
I...

77
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,487
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,985
I was supposed to take care of him.

79
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,533
I suck.

80
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,132
I suck.

81
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,833
- I suck.
- No.

82
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:54,674
I suck. I suck!

83
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,771
You don't suck.

84
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,258
<i>Maybe the lesson is:</i>

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,925
<i>sometimes, to get
to real paradise,</i>

86
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:22,027
<i>you need to take a road
so dark, there are no stars.</i>

87
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,140
Help!

88
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:35,715
Help me!

89
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,082
I can't get out!

90
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,285
Is anyone there?

91
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,453
Help me! Shane...!

92
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,820
Shane, you're drooling.

93
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,056
Dude, you are freaking out.

94
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,462
What's up with you?

95
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:55,058
I didn't get any sleep
at all last night.

96
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,502
I was playing Alien Siege
for 11 straight hours.

97
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:00,870
Oh, you're so lucky your old man
pulls 24-hour shifts, dude.

98
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,408
What level did you get up to?

99
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:04,138
Uh, 13. I was blazing.

100
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,178
You're such a liar.

101
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,906
There's no level higher than nine.

102
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,174
Not for you, J.J.

103
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,943
Obviously, you didn't
see the black hole.

104
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:11,073
Uh-huh.

105
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,617
So, Shane, if you were
gaming all night,

106
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:14,278
I guess you're not worried
about the science test.

107
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:19,847
See you there.

108
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,415
Arlo took it first period.

109
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,121
He said it was brutal.

110
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,493
Aw, man, I'm doomed.

111
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:26,588
And I'm way doomed.

112
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,825
Hey, guys,

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,026
I'm just gonna hit
the head real quick.

114
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,003
<i>Keep your books closed.</i>

115
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,477
You may not refer to your notes.

116
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,309
Do not look at anyone else's test.

117
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,941
Please be sure to put your name
in the top left-hand corner.

118
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,780
And read through in its entirety.

119
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:48,909
Go.

120
00:08:06,136 --> 00:08:07,864
How's it going, Shane?

121
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:10,303
Don't you guys have
a fire to put out?

122
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:11,636
Picking up filters for the rig.

123
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,232
So, what, you ditching school today?

124
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,743
Uh, hello? Holiday.

125
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:19,844
Malcolm X's birthday.

126
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,679
Is that today?

127
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,241
Yeah, Malcolm X Day.

128
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,378
Right... on.

129
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,154
Hey, I'm gonna roll.

130
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,190
I'll see you guys later.

131
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:30,189
Hey, you want to hitch with us?

132
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:31,556
No, I'm cool.

133
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:33,355
I'm just gonna clear my head.

134
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,089
Hey, don't be
getting yourself

135
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,892
into any trouble today!

136
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,489
Thanks, Lionel,
I already have a dad!

137
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:42,933
You'd better call the cap.

138
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,204
Joe! Get the phone!

139
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:58,350
You get it!

140
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,716
I'm making lunch!

141
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,914
You're closer, okay?!

142
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,183
Cap!

143
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:05,349
Pep won't answer the phone!

144
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,283
Since you guys are so busy...

145
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,262
Engine 55. Connor...

146
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,299
Uh, Captain Fahey speaking.

147
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,526
Heads up, Cap.

148
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:17,501
We just saw Shane on Fulton Avenue.

149
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:18,696
When?

150
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,932
Like, now, maybe 30 seconds ago.

151
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,600
Hey, ask him if today's Malcolm X's birthday.

152
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:25,142
Bring him in.

153
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,939
Okay, Cap, we're on it.

154
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:32,277
And, uh, and maybe pick up lunch.

155
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,388
I hate to bring him in today.

156
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,504
Shut your yap.

157
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,410
Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,785
You're mine.

159
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,503
All try...

160
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,971
all fail.

161
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,239
Oh, yeah.

162
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,941
That's right.

163
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,649
End of the line, mutt.

164
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,731
Ugh! Mouth fart.

165
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,390
Ugh!

166
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,266
If you're gonna ditch,

167
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,894
you're gonna get caught, Shane.

168
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,938
What do you got to say
for yourself, huh?

169
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,366
I hate that dog.

170
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,968
You're my favorite star.

171
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,305
I have a question-
Rexxx, over here.

172
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,709
Tell us, Rexxx, who are you wearing?

173
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,442
Rexxx, a few words for your fans.

174
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,473
WOMAN
Bay Street. Vehicle fire.

175
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,609
Incident 205-0.

176
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,617
Be advised.

177
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,483
South Harbor 55

178
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,455
is off-line until further notice.

179
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,084
Cap's waiting for you
in the locker room.

180
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,128
And he is seriously angry.

181
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,857
Yeah, what else is new?

182
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,026
I guess you'll find out
when you get punished.

183
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,466
Hey, dude, just do what I do.

184
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,026
The second he opens his mouth,
start crying.

185
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,096
Or better yet, tell
him it's in your DNA.

186
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,143
That means everything
horrible you do is his fault.

187
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,512
Joe, how do I play this one?

188
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,707
Play?

189
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:39,648
You get in there,

190
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,810
look him in the eye,
and say you're sorry.

191
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,751
Go!

192
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,618
Give him a break, Joe.

193
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,287
Kid's mom split
when he was, like, two.

194
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,387
He's an orphan.

195
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,760
He's not an orphan.

196
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:55,763
He's got a dad.

197
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,424
Yeah, so no mom

198
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,628
and a firefighter dad.

199
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,931
Pretty much makes him an orphan.

200
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,994
- Right.
- Well, he's got us.

201
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,674
Hope he finds a good shrink.

202
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:14,742
Hey.

203
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:17,047
How many times did I
warn you about ditching?

204
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,679
Three? Four?

205
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,518
That's, um, that's my PSP, Dad.

206
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,581
Can I have it back?

207
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:26,183
You know, it doesn't seem
to matter what I say.

208
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,389
So I'm gonna hit you where it hurts.

209
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:30,523
- No PSP,
- What?!

210
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,691
no PlayStation,

211
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,324
Come on, Dad, don't do this to me.

212
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,368
...no iPod.

213
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,528
<i>Dad, come on.</i>

214
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,265
You know, nothing else
seems to work with you.

215
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,772
DISPATCHER
Engine 55, Engine 24...

216
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,072
I don't know what to do, Shane.

217
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,205
- Ladder 33, respond.
- Come on.

218
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:49,216
Hamilton Avenue, structure fire.

219
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:51,444
Terence!
You took my helmet again.

220
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:52,712
This is definitely mine.

221
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,946
Then why's my name on it?

222
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:56,817
Exactly.

223
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,884
Hey, come on, guys.

224
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,358
Suit up is
supposed to take one minute,

225
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,827
- no more.
Let's go, Dogpatch!

226
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,759
South Side's getting hot, Captain.

227
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:11,359
Copy that.

228
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,564
Check the extremities,
then set up for a ground deluge.

229
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,731
Roger that.

230
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,468
What's the status inside, Burke?

231
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,373
Secondary search complete, Captain.

232
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,638
It's all clear inside.

233
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,612
All right, lose the masks
and position all crews

234
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,011
for exterior attack.

235
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:26,449
No rescues for you today, Sparky.

236
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:28,983
Entry Control,

237
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,783
secondary search is complete.

238
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,847
Let's lock up that building-
no one else goes in.

239
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,320
Dad.

240
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,821
Stay in the rig, Shane.

241
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,660
Looks like Greenpoint's first on the scene.

242
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,628
- Again?
- And we're last.

243
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,560
Again.

244
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,996
Hey, Jess.

245
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,124
Last four in a row, Dogpatch.

246
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,792
Looks like you're
buying the ice cream.

247
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:21,733
- Yeah, where do you want us?
- Stand by.

248
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,101
We'll see where we need you.

249
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,901
And don't trip over my hoses.

250
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,065
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:29,076
All right, boys, surround and drown.

252
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:31,271
We're standing by.

253
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,175
Great.

254
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,843
- Standing by again.
- Beautiful.

255
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,927
Dad, look!

256
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,843
55, life net!

257
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:13,347
McBride, double-time me to the roof.

258
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,868
Come on, guys, step it up!

259
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,097
Let's do this.

260
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,639
Ready and... lift!

261
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:47,214
Hang on, boy.

262
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,048
Just hang on.

263
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,596
No!

264
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,402
Hang on, bud. Hang on.

265
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,468
Okay, let's move.

266
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,843
Firefighter down.

267
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,643
Dogpatch, where's that life net?

268
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:23,776
- Let's move it!
- Let's go!

269
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,114
Need another man.

270
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,448
- Let's move. Let's move this.
- I'm on it!

271
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,453
Hustle!

272
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,013
Hang on, we're coming, Cap!

273
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,116
Guys...

274
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,319
- snap it up!
- Hustle, guys, come on, move it.

275
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:34,794
Focus, guys, we're almost there.

276
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,023
That's it. That's it.

277
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,427
Hang on, Cap.

278
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,798
Move!

279
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,336
To the right!

280
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,103
No!

281
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:52,704
Huh?

282
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,778
Come on, mutt.

283
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:04,049
Let's get him some oxygen.

284
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,649
Dad, you okay?

285
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,285
Yeah. Come on.

286
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:09,851
- Cap, you all right?
- I'm okay.

287
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,556
I'm fine.
How's the dog?

288
00:19:11,631 --> 00:19:13,826
Smells like
rotten tomatoes,

289
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,162
but he'll live.

290
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,168
Oh, no.

291
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,067
Not you.

292
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,730
You know this dog?

293
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,171
Yeah, it's the mutt from hell.

294
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,798
"Dew. "

295
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,071
He's got a name but no
address, no phone number.

296
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,271
I'll call Animal Control.

297
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,711
No, we'll handle it.

298
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,806
So much for standing by,
huh, Connor?

299
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,914
All right, 55,

300
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:36,851
we got hot spots on the South Side.

301
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,048
Let's hustle.

302
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,090
Yes!

303
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,624
Back in the game.

304
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,682
All right, put the dog
in the rig, all right?

305
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,125
Me?

306
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,391
Yeah, you.

307
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,331
All right, Joe.
Come on, you got it.

308
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,938
Hey, Zach.

309
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:04,742
Hey, Cap, we got company.

310
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,183
Hey, Zach.

311
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,344
Hey, Connor.

312
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,614
- Welcome back.
- Oh, thanks.

313
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:15,283
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,791
- It's good to see you, man.
- Yeah, you, too.

315
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,418
I guess I haven't
seen you since, uh...

316
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,485
Uncle Marc's memorial.

317
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,227
Yeah, it's...
too long.

318
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:25,732
I've been meaning
to come around, but...

319
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,063
You gonna stay for dinner?

320
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:28,966
Who's cooking this week?

321
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,368
Me.

322
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,900
- I made plenty.
- How's it going, Joe?

323
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:35,341
I, uh... I better not.

324
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,707
I'm a little pressed for time.

325
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:40,513
Can we talk?

326
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,071
Yeah. Hey, Pep.

327
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,674
You want to get back
into that engine?

328
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,412
We just... We cannot
be late on another call.

329
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:46,748
I'm on it.

330
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:49,085
Hey, guys, clean up that
gear, get the truck ready.

331
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:50,747
Shane, you're still on dog duty.

332
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,922
Dog duty.

333
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:57,486
What? He said it.

334
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,862
Dog duty?

335
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,639
Shane, grab my tools, okay?

336
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:08,230
Yeah.

337
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,172
Come on, mutt.

338
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:13,907
Fine, suit yourself.

339
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,992
Hey!

340
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,059
Shane!

341
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:44,935
Yo, Shane!
Today, little bro.

342
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,999
Yeah, I'm coming.

343
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,904
Hey, Terence, let's get these hoses cleaned up.

344
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:52,313
How's Shane doing?

345
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:54,850
Oh, wish I knew.

346
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,113
Doesn't talk
to me anymore,

347
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,018
you know, unless it's
some half-baked lie

348
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,683
or lame excuse.

349
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,783
Just, since Marc died, it's just...

350
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,225
I think he's just
having trouble moving on.

351
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:07,694
And what about you?

352
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:10,698
I'm fine.

353
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:15,103
These the suspect fires
you were talking about?

354
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,866
Yeah... Yeah, thanks
for sending out

355
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,236
those incident reports; I know
it wasn't exactly protocol.

356
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,471
No, it wasn't.

357
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,077
They add up to anything?

358
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:26,636
No, well, not yet, but I think...

359
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,412
I think there might be a fire bug.

360
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,347
Connor...

361
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,082
the department has experts
who handle this kind of thing.

362
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,487
And last I looked,
the captain's office

363
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,049
is over there.

364
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:40,458
Yeah, well, I like sitting out here.

365
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:41,859
It keeps me close to the guys.

366
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,497
Okay, so, Joe's cooking

367
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,696
didn't bring you
down here-what's up?

368
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,135
After the mill fire,

369
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,833
everybody from
the mayor on down

370
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,875
was counting on you
to fill Marc's shoes.

371
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,378
Now, we all expected
a period of adjustment.

372
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,004
Your brother
was one hell

373
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,173
of a fire captain.

374
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,341
Those were big shoes to fill,
and we knew that.

375
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,214
But these last couple of months...

376
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,651
Downtown is worried

377
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,847
that this house isn't moving
in the right direction.

378
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,766
What are you looking at?

379
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,631
Not a word out of you, mutt.

380
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,167
Who's that guy?

381
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,734
City manager.

382
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,646
But he's okay.
He was one of us.

383
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,048
Which is exactly why they
sent him to spank us.

384
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,544
Every time
I make a supply request,

385
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,113
it comes back with
a big red X on it.

386
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,658
Budget cuts are hitting
everybody hard.

387
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,820
Look, I'm sorry,
Connor,

388
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,829
but the city council
is advising the mayor

389
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:55,091
to shut down Dogpatch.

390
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,997
If it happens,
your territory

391
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,002
will be absorbed by Shoreline
Station and Greenpoint.

392
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,781
Grub's on! Meat stew.

393
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,980
Wash up! Let's go!

394
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:26,985
You hear me?!

395
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:29,530
Get a move on!
It's meat stew!

396
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,625
I hate it when he says
"meat stew" like that.

397
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,602
Why doesn't he just
tell us what's in it?

398
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,865
It's meat.

399
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,530
Mm-hmm.
More like mystery meat.

400
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:42,167
Yeah, but it's starting to
taste more and more like...

401
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,478
Dog, you just read my mind.

402
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:47,775
Hey, what are you doing?!
If you don't...

403
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:52,508
Dog, if you don't get off
that table, I'm gonna...

404
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,222
Whoa. Is that thing rabid?

405
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:03,285
No. Easy, Zach.
He hasn't bitten anybody.

406
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,957
Come on, Terence, grab him!

407
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,522
- Yet.
- I got him!

408
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,397
No, not his tail!
Geez!

409
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,368
Terence, you nitwit!

410
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:13,201
You stay.

411
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:14,570
- There he goes!
- Come on, cut him off!

412
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:15,902
- Lock him in the engine room.
- Cut him off!

413
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:18,534
Can't you just buy us some time?

414
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:19,976
I mean, come on, Zach.

415
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:21,705
You owe us that.

416
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:24,807
I'll see what I can do.

417
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,418
I told you...
I told you to watch him.

418
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,082
I did. I-I was.

419
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,854
You...

420
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:39,556
- ... going to.
- Right. Okay, take him home.

421
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:41,689
Make up a "found dog" flyer,

422
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:44,564
and I want it posted
first thing in the morning.

423
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:47,103
You got that?

424
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,366
Yeah.

425
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:07,285
Nice, huh?

426
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,721
Enjoy it while it lasts.

427
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:13,887
What's the matter with you?

428
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:17,724
Hey! Where are you going?!

429
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,699
Stop!

430
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,361
Are you crazy?! Get back here.

431
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:31,808
What?

432
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,177
What is your problem?

433
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:42,046
What?

434
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,168
You are one strange dog.

435
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,669
Come on, mutt, look at me.

436
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,467
Stop moving. Hold still.

437
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,738
Hey.

438
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,070
No.

439
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:11,742
No... no...

440
00:27:11,818 --> 00:27:13,285
Loser.

441
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,994
What are you doing?

442
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,536
No, no, everything has a place.

443
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,701
This is my house!

444
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,178
This is my room.

445
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:45,208
Stop.

446
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:46,874
You're ripping it.

447
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:49,512
Let go!

448
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,956
This is my house.

449
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:03,898
And this is my bed.

450
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:13,699
Night, mutt.

451
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,416
You're probably not even lost.

452
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,008
They probably kicked your
crusty butt to the curb!

453
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,464
Fine.

454
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,757
Sleep well, fur ball, 'cause
tomorrow you're out of here.

455
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:03,611
Come on, rookie.

456
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,352
My grandmother can lay hose
straighter than that.

457
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:09,087
Yeah, she can also
bench press 350 pounds.

458
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:11,061
Hey, Shane!

459
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,154
What's up, Shane?

460
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:14,063
Shanester!
How's it?

461
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,058
Keep it straight!
Keep it straight!

462
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,934
Okay, Captain, try it now.

463
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:22,469
Nothing.

464
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,032
This thing's a rat's nest.

465
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,644
Flyers are done.

466
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,111
Need the stapler.

467
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,670
Yeah, okay, well, take it easy.

468
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,479
We're running short
on just about everything.

469
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:39,250
Sit.

470
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,754
He's not very friendly
for a dog, is he?

471
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:46,421
You don't know the half of it.

472
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:52,094
This is Felicity Hammer
bringing you tragic news.

473
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,898
After a massive manhunt,

474
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:57,429
the search for missing superstar
Rexxx... has been called off.

475
00:29:57,508 --> 00:29:59,566
Tragically, the number one

476
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:02,476
<i>box office champ of
such films as Jurassic Bark</i>

477
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:03,672
and its sequels

478
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:06,909
had just launched
his own pet perfume line.

479
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:09,451
The perfume, redolent of bacon,

480
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,383
squirrel and butt crack,

481
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:14,446
had taken the luxury
pet industry by storm.

482
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:16,958
Rexxx's lifetime companion,
manager Trey Falcon,

483
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,960
was unavailable for comment,
but inside sources

484
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,894
report he has scheduled

485
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:24,124
a private memorial service
for later this month.

486
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,425
Next up, Cher turns 60?

487
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:29,129
Stay tuned.

488
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,630
How 'bout now?!

489
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:34,106
Uh... no.

490
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,680
Are all these red pins arson fires?

491
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,551
No, not officially.

492
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,022
According to the city.

493
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:55,489
But... that's the textile mill.

494
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,894
Yeah.

495
00:30:57,964 --> 00:31:00,957
You think the fire that killed
Uncle Marc was set on purpose?

496
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:03,525
I don't know, um...

497
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:05,594
I mean, you see
the same flashover

498
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,537
and burn patterns again and again...

499
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:12,237
Uh... I don't know.

500
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,643
Maybe I could help.

501
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:16,772
You know, Shane, Shane...

502
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,318
don't worry about it;
it's just a theory.

503
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,710
Now, if you really
want to help,

504
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:25,689
you could find Dewey's owner, okay?

505
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:28,449
Yeah.

506
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:30,927
Okay.

507
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:41,871
No, stop!

508
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:48,769
If you don't stay in one place,
I can't get rid of you.

509
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:56,748
Fine.

510
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:01,851
Sit... stay, whatever
it takes to leave me alone.

511
00:32:19,575 --> 00:32:20,701
Look out!

512
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,423
What are you, some kind
of freak-show circus dog?

513
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:41,926
So...

514
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,921
what else you got?

515
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:10,086
Ow!

516
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,381
Mikey, Max,
if you don't leave

517
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,882
your daddy alone, I'm gonna...

518
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,713
Works every time.

519
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,155
I heard that, Joe.

520
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,159
Max, stop biting your little brother.

521
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,660
Thanks.

522
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,489
All right, everybody, let's give it up

523
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,193
for Falstaff from
Shoreline Company C,

524
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,428
who's leaving his mark
on this course.

525
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,766
And while our volunteers
clean that up,

526
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,171
I want to bring up
the man whose company

527
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,105
has underwritten
this entire day for us.

528
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:09,372
Please give it up
for Mr. Corbin Sellars.

529
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,007
Thank you, Zach.

530
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,446
Don't applaud me.

531
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:16,349
I should be applauding you.

532
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:17,646
SELLARS Honestly...

533
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,688
Went down pretty hard in that
ladder climb competition.

534
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:22,884
Good thing you landed on your head.

535
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,585
Yeah.

536
00:34:28,897 --> 00:34:31,831
Yeah.

537
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,796
You know, when I was a pro ball player,

538
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:40,773
my coach had a quote
that he used before every game.

539
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,600
"It's not what lies before us... "

540
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,171
You know, I bet your brother's
looking down today and smiling.

541
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:49,806
- "It's what lies within us. "
- Yep.

542
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:53,615
Yeah, nothing made Marc happier
than kicking Greenpoint's butt.

543
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,518
...all of you today...

544
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:58,790
But you didn't

545
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,759
come here to listen to some
old quarterback yammer.

546
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:05,730
So, next up... we have
Sparky of Greenpoint,

547
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,824
as he's handled by
Jasmine "J.J." Presley,

548
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:12,702
daughter of illustrious
Fire Captain Jessie Presley.

549
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:15,767
- Here we go.
- Come on, J.J.

550
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,374
Stay.

551
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:37,160
Somebody should test
that dog for steroids.

552
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,660
And Sparky completes the course
in a record time of 44 seconds,

553
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:22,431
eclipsing the record set
last year

554
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,131
by Blue of Dogpatch Station.

555
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:26,105
Let's give him a hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

556
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:27,802
Aw, man!

557
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:29,469
Nice job, J.J.

558
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:32,012
That was awesome!

559
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,346
Let's get out of here, Captain.

560
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:41,719
Our, uh, our final competitor
is Dogpatch's own Dewey,

561
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,381
handled by Shane Fahey,

562
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:45,687
son of Captain Connor Fahey.

563
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:46,691
Shane?

564
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,456
And the "mutt from hell"?

565
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:17,354
What? Come on.

566
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:20,686
What is that?

567
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:27,057
That all you got?

568
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:38,075
- Oh, come on!
- Nice mutt!

569
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:40,702
- Yeah!
- Dogpatch, you gotta be kidding me.

570
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,575
- Whoo!
- His legs are too short.

571
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:45,540
No chance!

572
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:50,681
Go on, Dewey.

573
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:58,556
Hey, don't trip, Fahey.

574
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:00,027
- Let's go, Dewey!
- Let's go, Dewey!

575
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:02,530
- Come on, Dewey!
You call that a dog?

576
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,793
That dog's a mutt!

577
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,892
All right, all right!

578
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,700
Go, Dewey, yeah!

579
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:17,441
Dewey is beating Sparky's split
time by a full three seconds.

580
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:19,708
Oh, yeah, now what?!

581
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,442
Huh? Now what?

582
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,769
All right!

583
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,608
Hold on, hold on.
Dewey's stopped right before

584
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,348
- the final obstacle.
- Dewey, what's wrong?

585
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:05,687
Dewey, jump!

586
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:06,783
Go!

587
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:10,259
Dewey? Dewey?

588
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,957
Get over it, dude.

589
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:46,825
She's not the only
babe on the beach.

590
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:02,345
Dewey!

591
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:06,877
Game over, folks.

592
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,315
- Sparky and J.J. Presley win the dog challenge.
- No!

593
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,352
Man!

594
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,922
Yes! Yes!

595
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,087
How did that happen?

596
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,288
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

597
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,422
Thanks.

598
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,192
Hey, yo, Dog Pound.

599
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:25,562
Hey, Connor.

600
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,432
Got some news about
your firehouse dog.

601
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:30,300
He's afraid of fire.

602
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:32,636
Last place- the mutt's
perfect for you guys.

603
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:33,765
Way to go, losers.

604
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:37,106
That was so... awesome.

605
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:38,770
Just the look on their faces
when they

606
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,109
thought they were gonna lose!

607
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,943
Yeah, watching them sweat,

608
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:43,483
it's the best thing
I've seen in months.

609
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:51,948
Come on, let's get out of here.

610
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:55,583
Go on, rub it in.

611
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,391
I just wanted to say that...

612
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:00,399
the better dog lost.

613
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,202
Come on.

614
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:19,579
At the 40, the 30, he may go all the way!

615
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,642
He's at the 20, the 10...

616
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,744
Hey, where you been?

617
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:23,788
Touchdown!

618
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,824
Just out walking,
shaking off the loss.

619
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:33,327
Hey, sit down with your old man.

620
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,887
Watch some football,
like the old days.

621
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,433
Yeah.

622
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:49,612
What?

623
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,806
I was just thinking, I...
It's been a long time

624
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:54,873
since I've seen my guys that happy.

625
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,112
He could've won, Dad.

626
00:41:56,187 --> 00:41:58,984
Yeah, he should've won.

627
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:00,283
...all the way to the end zone.

628
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,256
Incredible play for the Bulldogs.

629
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:12,860
So, I saw you talking to

630
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,630
Jessie's little girl at the picnic.

631
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:17,297
What's the deal with you and her?

632
00:42:17,372 --> 00:42:19,704
Dad, she's Greenpoint.

633
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,766
Just... I'm just asking.
Forget I mentioned it.

634
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:29,146
You have any luck on
the flyers you put up?

635
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:31,549
No, not yet.

636
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,054
Okay, well, give it time.
Somebody's gonna call.

637
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:55,507
- Dad...
- Mm-hmm?

638
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:57,338
I- I was thinking...

639
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,935
what if nobody calls?

640
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:03,005
Maybe he could
stick around for awhile.

641
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,779
M- Maybe Dogpatch
needs another mascot.

642
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,786
No, Dogpatch is living
on borrowed time.

643
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,414
There's not much point
in a mascot now.

644
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,753
Well, I-I could
take care of him

645
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:14,690
and you wouldn't have
to deal with him at all.

646
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,354
You really want to be
responsible for this dog?

647
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,691
Yeah, I do.

648
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:36,009
Okay, you wanted to be
responsible for the dog, you got it.

649
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,604
- But...
- Shane.

650
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,713
Let's get a mop.

651
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,127
What the...?!

652
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,424
Dog, if you messed up my room...

653
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:12,780
Great.

654
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,578
I'm sharing my cell
with Martha Stewart.

655
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:22,317
Sorry, fleabag, not tonight.

656
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,826
You need to learn
some healthy boundaries.

657
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:54,079
And you better not snore.

658
00:44:56,522 --> 00:44:58,957
You're such a jerk.

659
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:22,007
Hey!

660
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,379
That TV is my personal property.

661
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:28,351
And no, I don't have a receipt.

662
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:37,388
Who's that?

663
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:40,487
Bean counter.
Sent by the city.

664
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:44,699
Pretty soon, everything
in here'll be shipped off

665
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:49,331
to stations all over
the city, including us.

666
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:51,499
But they can't split you guys up.

667
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:54,042
Yeah, they can!
And they will.

668
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,170
Not much of the old
neighborhood left anyway.

669
00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:01,149
Everything's been all
boarded up and sold off.

670
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,809
Guess there's
some things

671
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:05,353
even a fireman can't save.

672
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:08,323
Remember what I told
you, now- no lunch

673
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:11,291
till you get that
engine room mopped up.

674
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,056
Good to know.

675
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:23,934
Hey...

676
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:25,598
nobody's supposed to be in here.

677
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:28,165
Couple of weeks, nobody will be.

678
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,173
Engine 55, Engine Eight, Engine 33...

679
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:34,804
Come on, Terence, we got to roll.

680
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:37,942
Ladder 24, Ladder 36, Rescue Seven respond.

681
00:46:39,988 --> 00:46:42,217
How many times
have I told you-

682
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:44,257
wait till my feet
hit the floor first!

683
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:45,917
Come on, you lovebirds,
get the lead out!

684
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:47,086
Let me go first next time.

685
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,787
What do you think this is,
clown school?!

686
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:50,489
They wouldn't let you
in the police department.

687
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:52,930
Me first, then you.
- Guys...

688
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,399
check out the dog.

689
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:57,960
Shane, get over here.

690
00:46:58,038 --> 00:47:00,301
Get the dog off the rig.

691
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:02,705
He's not a mascot.

692
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:04,437
Don't let him out of your sight.

693
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:07,408
Dewey, down!

694
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,954
What's the matter with you?

695
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:27,932
Crap.

696
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:38,774
Coming in right now.

697
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:44,905
That's right, get 'em behind the barricade!

698
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:49,251
We need these people back.

699
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,183
Okay.

700
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,024
Need a medic.

701
00:47:57,093 --> 00:47:58,856
Okay, take it easy.
You're gonna be fine.

702
00:47:58,928 --> 00:48:00,691
Get those people off the bridge!

703
00:48:00,763 --> 00:48:02,959
We have folks down there
trying to do a job.

704
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:04,499
I need to get through.

705
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,057
Okay, everybody here
behind the barricade.

706
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:08,433
Hey, guy... I need you to step
away from the rail, please.

707
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:10,334
Everybody follow me-
Look at me, please, sir.

708
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:11,464
Back behind the barricade.

709
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,473
Here you go, buddy.

710
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:15,468
Hey, Burr?

711
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:17,444
What's the size-up?

712
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:19,503
Retrofitters breached the
interior support,

713
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:21,573
so the ceiling's coming down
pretty fast.

714
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:23,447
Got the workers out just in time.

715
00:48:23,518 --> 00:48:25,281
Where does Jessie want us?

716
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:26,843
My money's on broom detail.

717
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,822
All clear. Let's lock it up.

718
00:48:33,095 --> 00:48:34,562
Easy, buddy, nice and easy.

719
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:40,333
Nobody else goes in.

720
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:42,301
Burr, where's Captain Presley?

721
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:44,166
Just look for the red helmet.

722
00:48:44,238 --> 00:48:45,728
No, Burr...

723
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:47,363
Where's Jessie?

724
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,305
Engine 24 captain unaccounted for.

725
00:48:56,382 --> 00:48:58,543
55 to Dispatch, we're
initiating a primary search.

726
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:05,655
Dewey? Dewey?

727
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:11,828
Dewey, get over here.

728
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:22,097
Dewey?

729
00:49:22,174 --> 00:49:25,404
Dewey, get over here.

730
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:30,645
Dewey!

731
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,050
What's the matter with you?

732
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:55,969
Burr, how many points of access?

733
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:57,768
Just the one. Cave-in
blocked the south ent...

734
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:02,771
Get-Get back.

735
00:50:02,845 --> 00:50:03,777
Everybody back!

736
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:07,643
Look out!

737
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,349
This whole place is coming down.

738
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,411
Captain, what do we do?

739
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,523
If Jessie's still in
there, we're gonna get her.

740
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:18,560
- Okay, let's do it.
- Pull everybody back.

741
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:22,725
- We're not leaving her...
- You're staying put.

742
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:24,162
Yeah.

743
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:25,824
That's an order, Burr.

744
00:50:28,102 --> 00:50:30,662
Joe, keep the medic close and ready-
I'll be on channel one.

745
00:50:30,738 --> 00:50:32,569
We're coming with you, Captain.

746
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,630
No.
Thanks, but no.

747
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:41,779
Uh, Dispatch, I need a dedicated
channel for search and rescue.

748
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:46,081
Roger that, 24, you're clear on channel three.

749
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:50,880
Jessie, do you copy?

750
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,851
Jessie, do you copy?

751
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,777
Jessie!

752
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,346
Jessie!

753
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:54,541
Jess.

754
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:21,265
Joe, where's my dad?

755
00:52:21,343 --> 00:52:24,335
Shane! Stay back.

756
00:52:24,413 --> 00:52:25,903
He'll be fine.

757
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:48,200
Be careful.

758
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,237
Come on!

759
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:12,218
Get out of here, dog!

760
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:17,458
I said get out of...

761
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:34,445
Jessie.

762
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,207
Jess.

763
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,961
Captain?
Do you copy?

764
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:12,143
Guys, look!

765
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,488
Medics!

766
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,069
Easy.

767
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:49,044
Good job, Cap.

768
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:51,084
I am ready to go home.

769
00:54:55,054 --> 00:54:57,985
Hey.

770
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:01,389
We were worried about you in there.

771
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:05,397
JESSIE
Another day at the office.

772
00:55:18,343 --> 00:55:20,573
All right, Jess, you take care of yourself.

773
00:55:20,645 --> 00:55:22,977
- We'll all be checking in.
- Thanks.

774
00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:25,516
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

775
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:27,609
You betcha.

776
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:36,785
Excuse me, is that

777
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,351
that dog who saved the day?

778
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:39,521
Yeah, it is.

779
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:40,894
Who does he belong to?

780
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,691
Engine 55.

781
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:47,760
We're lucky to have him.
His name is Dewey,

782
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:49,430
and he's the mascot
of Dogpatch Station.

783
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:53,806
Huh! Well, smile, wonder dog.

784
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:55,902
You made the news.

785
00:55:58,548 --> 00:55:59,515
And we're back,

786
00:55:59,582 --> 00:56:00,981
at 12 minutes past the hour.

787
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,074
This next one really made my day.

788
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,313
An historic firehouse
in Lincoln County,

789
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:08,652
which has been slated
for closure later this week

790
00:56:08,724 --> 00:56:12,820
is being credited
with one last lifesaving rescue.

791
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:15,557
<i>Meet Dewey, mascot of Engine 55</i>

792
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,099
<i>and the hero of yesterday's
tunnel collapse.</i>

793
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,896
Dewey is new to the team,
but as you can see,

794
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:22,230
he's raring to go.

795
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:24,272
We spoke with
Captain Connor Fahey

796
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,899
and the brave firefighters
of Engine 55

797
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:28,168
and asked them...

798
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,421
The entertainment industry

799
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,583
honors its own today
at a memorial service

800
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:48,651
for canine action star Rexxx,
who died tragically last month.

801
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:51,390
Security is tight,
and emotions are high,

802
00:56:51,464 --> 00:56:54,228
as a veritable who's who
of Hollywood stardom

803
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,201
is in attendance.

804
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:59,135
I had a mantra:

805
00:56:59,204 --> 00:57:01,638
Next year, Rexxx.

806
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:05,200
Next year we'll nap
by a roaring fire.

807
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:08,303
Next year we'll play Frisbee

808
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,974
under a blue moon.

809
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,110
Next year we'll take that hike
through Joshua Tree.

810
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:19,023
Well, there is no next year.

811
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,858
And tonight,
there's a bright new star

812
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:26,123
shining in Heaven.

813
00:57:29,467 --> 00:57:32,061
TREY I loved my dog.

814
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:43,008
It's just the way he
would have wanted it,

815
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:45,571
thanks to you.

816
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,311
Cut the water!

817
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:53,151
Ah, it's the least I could do.

818
00:57:54,157 --> 00:57:56,488
Rexxx always had a flair for drama.

819
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,488
Oh, Trey.

820
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:05,227
Let me take you to dinner, okay?

821
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:08,827
I can't... I can't believe he's gone.

822
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:16,375
Now it's too late for
Rexxx to just be a dog.

823
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:38,424
Engine 55,

824
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,966
Ladder 24, Ladder Eight,

825
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:42,229
Rescue Nine, respond.

826
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:45,203
Kessler Parkway, electrical
fire. Power lines down.

827
00:58:50,978 --> 00:58:52,240
Come on, guys!

828
00:59:37,054 --> 00:59:39,955
No.

829
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:44,426
Fine.

830
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:10,574
Okay.

831
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,210
Move over.

832
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:35,172
Figures.

833
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:38,371
We finally get our act together
just in time to close.

834
01:00:38,446 --> 01:00:40,072
Yep.

835
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:42,479
Good old Dogpatch- late as usual.

836
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:44,074
That's us.

837
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:47,848
Well, at least we came out swinging, right?

838
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,388
Someone order rocky road?

839
01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:50,650
CONNOR
Is that

840
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:52,315
a parting gift, Zach?

841
01:00:52,391 --> 01:00:53,654
No, courtesy of Greenpoint.

842
01:00:53,727 --> 01:00:56,218
Told 'em I was coming over here
on business anyway.

843
01:00:56,296 --> 01:00:59,856
I, uh... prefer to give
bad news in person.

844
01:00:59,932 --> 01:01:01,991
You got our reassignments?

845
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:03,399
Afraid not.

846
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,562
Okay, so what's the bad news?

847
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:07,629
Bad news is...

848
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,402
you're gonna be up all night
unpacking this stuff.

849
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:14,274
The orders came down
from the mayor himself:

850
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:15,438
Dogpatch is staying put.

851
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:16,446
For real?

852
01:01:16,515 --> 01:01:17,572
That furry
little publicity magnet

853
01:01:17,649 --> 01:01:19,844
you've got there saved
this company's rear end.

854
01:01:19,918 --> 01:01:21,715
Yeah!

855
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:22,754
- Dewey!
- Yeah!

856
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:25,620
- That's so solid, man!
- What?!

857
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,588
Okay!

858
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:27,682
Yeah!

859
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:30,350
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

860
01:01:33,331 --> 01:01:34,423
Well, Shane was right.

861
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:37,558
Maybe all Dogpatch needed
was a good dog.

862
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:43,202
Okay, shoot, shoot!

863
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:44,740
What's up?

864
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:46,901
What do you think is up?

865
01:01:46,977 --> 01:01:49,638
Mrs. Renzi busted
a pop quiz first period.

866
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:50,804
- Arlo said it was...
- Yeah.

867
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:52,007
Brutal. I got it.

868
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:53,413
No.

869
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:54,609
Not just brutal.

870
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:55,742
Way brutal.

871
01:01:57,453 --> 01:01:59,250
Oh, man.

872
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:02,052
- Can I copy off of you?
- I was gonna copy off of you.

873
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:03,887
Hey, you copied off me last time.

874
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,894
- That was one answer!
- It was an answer.

875
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:06,986
You owe me.

876
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:09,496
See you later, Shane.

877
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:11,396
Where's my lunch money?

878
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:16,125
As your friends in first period
undoubtedly told you,

879
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:18,764
there will be a pop quiz today.

880
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,968
This quiz will cover everything
we reviewed last week.

881
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:24,477
And remember,
any incomplete answers

882
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:25,740
do count as mistakes.

883
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:27,678
I see a lot of gum chewing.

884
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:31,708
Please visit the wastebasket
immediately if that is the case.

885
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:33,776
Thank you.

886
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:38,925
Hey, Joe, check this out.

887
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:41,291
B- plus on my science test.

888
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:43,296
Hey! I'm impressed.

889
01:02:43,364 --> 01:02:45,195
Did you copy?

890
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:48,701
No. I studied for
almost one whole night.

891
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,507
Are you...
actually cooking?

892
01:02:56,576 --> 01:02:59,511
- Hey.
- Hey, Shane.

893
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,776
- Where's my dad?
- He's downtown at a meeting, knockin' heads.

894
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:05,911
Where's his stuff?

895
01:03:05,984 --> 01:03:08,044
In his office.

896
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:31,074
Sure... make yourself right at home.

897
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,410
What was wrong with his old office?

898
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,575
He's captain- he belongs here.

899
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:44,142
Look, I know I told you to blame
your DNA for all your problems.

900
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,245
Moving on wasn't easy
for your dad,

901
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,053
but he's finally stepping up...

902
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,888
and maybe you should, too.

903
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:54,113
Hey... hey, I just got a call
from the Public Affairs Office.

904
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:56,883
Apparently, the mayor
wants you and Dewey

905
01:04:56,957 --> 01:04:59,481
to appear
at the Firefighters Benefit.

906
01:04:59,558 --> 01:05:00,957
That's cool, huh?

907
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:02,654
Yeah.

908
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:07,898
What's going on?

909
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:11,261
I- I was...

910
01:05:11,336 --> 01:05:13,498
I was just getting you organized.

911
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,942
Wait a minute.
This is... this is my...

912
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:31,351
Yeah, your wall map.
It beats pushpins.

913
01:05:31,422 --> 01:05:34,256
You... you shouldn't
have done all this.

914
01:05:34,325 --> 01:05:36,121
Sorry.

915
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:39,761
No, I mean,
you should never have felt

916
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:42,424
that this was your responsibility.

917
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:51,367
I know in the past six months
I've really been ragging on you

918
01:05:51,441 --> 01:05:53,535
for just about everything,

919
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:56,034
and I...

920
01:05:56,112 --> 01:05:58,273
I think the truth is,
I'm the one who's...

921
01:05:58,347 --> 01:06:00,144
been neglecting what's important.

922
01:06:01,684 --> 01:06:02,776
What's that?

923
01:06:02,852 --> 01:06:05,320
It's you.

924
01:06:06,322 --> 01:06:09,256
'Cause you're so smart...

925
01:06:09,324 --> 01:06:11,657
and capable and strong.

926
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:16,523
And I've been... kind of lost

927
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:21,024
in all of this
since Marc died, and I...

928
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:24,662
I think I've turned
into a pretty lousy dad.

929
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,904
I'm sorry.

930
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:38,815
And thanks for this.

931
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:54,028
I'm not strong.

932
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:57,228
I'm weak.

933
01:06:57,303 --> 01:07:00,101
I'm a bad person.

934
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:05,942
Why would you even...
think something like that?

935
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:14,951
The day of the mill fire...

936
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,010
I was at school.

937
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:18,578
The trucks drove by.

938
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,233
Hey!

939
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:30,858
There he is.

940
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:33,369
Shane!

941
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:37,998
<i>Then J.J. called her mom.</i>

942
01:07:38,075 --> 01:07:41,704
She said a firefighter was missing.

943
01:07:41,779 --> 01:07:45,236
<i>I ran back to the fire station
as fast as I could.</i>

944
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:53,285
<i>When I got there,
nobody would look at me.</i>

945
01:07:53,356 --> 01:07:56,552
<i>Not Joe...</i>

946
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,924
<i>not Lionel...</i>

947
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:01,428
<i>not Pep.</i>

948
01:08:02,631 --> 01:08:05,691
<i>That's when I was sure
you were dead.</i>

949
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:13,464
I loved Uncle Marc.

950
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:20,140
But when I found out it was him...

951
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:23,140
I was happy.

952
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:28,011
I was happy 'cause it wasn't you.

953
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,871
We're gonna be okay.

954
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,554
Thank you.

955
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,726
Okay, we've just got the tally.

956
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:20,464
Now, this "little reception"
has raised over $100,000

957
01:09:20,538 --> 01:09:21,869
for our firefighters.

958
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,270
How 'bout that, huh?

959
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,434
Yes, give yourself a round of
applause and while you're at it,

960
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,444
how about something
for our honored guests

961
01:09:27,512 --> 01:09:31,072
from Dogpatch Station, Engine 55?

962
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,149
Now maybe we can squeeze
a new battery out of the department.

963
01:09:38,222 --> 01:09:40,122
Thanks for pleading
our cause with the mayor.

964
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,714
Hey, don't thank me;
thank Super Mutt.

965
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:45,762
Hey, where's Pep?
She's gonna miss all this.

966
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:48,093
I don't know.
I'll try her again.

967
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:54,294
Here she comes, and she
is way out of uniform.

968
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:57,633
Since when are you a girl?

969
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:59,072
Stop staring.

970
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:00,870
You'll burn holes.

971
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,675
Okay, seriously, let's
get to the real reason

972
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:07,942
we're here tonight.

973
01:10:08,016 --> 01:10:10,644
This little pooch has
been on CNN, Fox News

974
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,745
and all five local news channels.

975
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:13,810
We're on!

976
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:16,084
Please welcome
the pride of Engine 55,

977
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,389
Dewey the Wonder Dog
and his boy, Shane Fahey.

978
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,196
Go, Shane!

979
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:30,069
Now, Shane is 12 years old.

980
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:33,470
Dewey is an undetermined age,
just like me.

981
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,536
Anyhow, have fun.

982
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,702
Thanks, Mr. Sellars.

983
01:10:37,778 --> 01:10:38,869
Hey, everybody.

984
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:41,540
So, before I get to
the more radical stunts,

985
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:42,980
let's start with something simple.

986
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,880
I need a volunteer, first of all.

987
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:46,418
How about you, Mr. Sellars?

988
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:47,953
Do you have a, uh, a watch

989
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:50,046
or a wallet or something
you carry on you?

990
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,315
I'm gonna get this back, right?

991
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:54,553
We hope.

992
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,390
All right.

993
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:00,763
See, all right?

994
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:05,068
All right, no peeking.

995
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,300
So, the next step is
to hide the watch.

996
01:11:10,376 --> 01:11:11,468
Dad.

997
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:17,275
Hide it good, now, Captain.

998
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:20,113
Being a firehouse mascot isn't all just for show.

999
01:11:20,185 --> 01:11:22,415
It's a real job
that requires real skills.

1000
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:26,014
Search and rescue
requires something more.

1001
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:28,581
All right, Dewey... find it.

1002
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,150
Go ahead.

1003
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:32,287
Dewey's sense of smell

1004
01:11:32,363 --> 01:11:35,854
is 10,000 times more powerful
than a human's.

1005
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:38,332
That, combined with the ability
for him to think on his paws,

1006
01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:39,995
makes him an invaluable

1007
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:41,163
search and rescue dog.

1008
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,706
He can remember a scent
for weeks, even months,

1009
01:11:43,774 --> 01:11:46,470
and recognize it
from a great distance.

1010
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:55,814
It really is you.

1011
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,455
Oh, I missed you, too.

1012
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:02,616
I missed you so much.

1013
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:04,750
I don't know how,
and I don't care,

1014
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:06,556
but you found my dog.

1015
01:12:12,101 --> 01:12:14,068
I was so bumming,

1016
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:16,365
and then I saw his
picture in the paper,

1017
01:12:16,438 --> 01:12:18,805
and dudes, I couldn't believe it.

1018
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:21,364
This dog is not an actor.

1019
01:12:21,443 --> 01:12:23,240
Oh, yeah, you must
have seen him

1020
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:25,904
<i>in The Fast and the Furriest.</i>

1021
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,814
Dudes, come on,
that's a Rexxx classic.

1022
01:12:29,884 --> 01:12:31,909
His name's not
even Rexxx; it's Dewey.

1023
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:34,510
It says so on his tag.

1024
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:38,388
No, see, that was the prop tag
he was wearing when he got lost.

1025
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:40,620
Our dog is not a movie star,
he's not a celebrity.

1026
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,628
He's a... he's a mutt.

1027
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:45,357
I mean, we-we practically
found him on the street.

1028
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,764
Yeah, well, see...

1029
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,167
he looks different in
these production stills

1030
01:12:50,237 --> 01:12:54,400
because his trademark
hairdo is, uh...

1031
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,670
it's a hairpiece.

1032
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:04,275
That's my boy.

1033
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:09,121
I mean, come on, you must've
noticed how special he was.

1034
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,655
Uh, look, Mr. Falcon,
I mean, I can appreciate

1035
01:13:11,723 --> 01:13:13,782
what you must have gone
through, but this, uh...

1036
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:16,327
this dog means a lot
to our engine company,

1037
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:18,328
a lot to the city...

1038
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:21,456
and particularly to my son.

1039
01:13:22,533 --> 01:13:24,524
Now, if there's any way

1040
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:27,037
that we can compensate you, uh...

1041
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:31,234
If you're asking me
to put a price on family...

1042
01:13:31,308 --> 01:13:32,707
I can't.

1043
01:13:34,211 --> 01:13:38,204
It's time for Rexxx to come home.

1044
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:39,374
You can't take him away.

1045
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,712
Well, Shane...

1046
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,546
Dad, do something.

1047
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,520
Shane...

1048
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:47,421
it's his dog.

1049
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:51,160
I know this doesn't
mean much to you

1050
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:54,628
right now, but... thanks
for taking care of him.

1051
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:01,161
Well, you got it wrong.

1052
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,728
He was the one taking care of us.

1053
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,107
Get out of here, then.

1054
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,236
Just go.

1055
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:17,577
Take him.

1056
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:21,280
I'm sorry.

1057
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,356
He was a pain in the butt, anyway.

1058
01:14:53,386 --> 01:14:55,013
Well, I was going to say
something wise and fatherly,

1059
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,022
but the truth is, this just sucks.

1060
01:14:57,089 --> 01:14:58,954
Cap, we got an EMS call.

1061
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:02,994
Fire Department!

1062
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:03,960
Hey!

1063
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,519
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait!

1064
01:15:05,598 --> 01:15:07,657
Hold up.

1065
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:10,800
All right, let's find you a ride home.

1066
01:15:10,868 --> 01:15:12,097
Brought my skateboard.

1067
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:15,629
- Shane, I'll find you a ride home.
- Just leave me alone.

1068
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:17,231
Well, I'll see you at home.

1069
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:35,255
Steve, let's clear off these centerpieces...

1070
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:03,744
Thanks.

1071
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:05,184
And, hey, I'm sorry about your dog.

1072
01:16:05,254 --> 01:16:06,346
Can I buy you another one?

1073
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:07,911
Another dog?

1074
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:10,151
Just think about it, okay?

1075
01:16:29,277 --> 01:16:31,006
Do you have a problem?

1076
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:33,444
I realize that, but
there's nothing I can do.

1077
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:35,004
What is the holdup?

1078
01:16:35,082 --> 01:16:37,277
More activity in
that area right now

1079
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:38,477
is sure to draw attention.

1080
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,213
And I'm not just talking
about Connor Fahey.

1081
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:42,312
I have finally put
a city council in place

1082
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,152
that will approve a sports complex.

1083
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:47,693
I want that final property in ashes.

1084
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:49,251
Do it tonight.

1085
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:51,592
Tonight?! How am I gonna do that?

1086
01:16:51,664 --> 01:16:53,154
You're a fireman.

1087
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:55,666
Figure it out.
Light a match!

1088
01:16:58,705 --> 01:17:00,138
Son of a...

1089
01:17:00,206 --> 01:17:02,265
God!

1090
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:10,804
No!

1091
01:17:10,882 --> 01:17:12,543
Don't you tell me I'm impatient.

1092
01:17:12,617 --> 01:17:15,347
I have waited long enough.

1093
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:18,082
No more excuses.
Call me when it's done.

1094
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:37,199
Dad was right.

1095
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:51,750
Ah, welcome to the Neu Hotel.

1096
01:17:51,821 --> 01:17:53,811
Please, come, come, come.

1097
01:17:54,823 --> 01:17:56,314
And if you need anything,

1098
01:17:56,392 --> 01:17:59,555
please do not hesitate to... ask.

1099
01:18:00,562 --> 01:18:01,995
Trash.

1100
01:18:07,169 --> 01:18:08,659
<i>Hey, Rexxx, it's good</i>

1101
01:18:08,737 --> 01:18:11,171
to have you back, buddy.

1102
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,140
Dude, what were they
feeding you, kibble?

1103
01:18:16,945 --> 01:18:19,879
This is so unreal, Trey.

1104
01:18:19,947 --> 01:18:22,916
Oh, I'm telling you...
Deep down in my gut, I knew

1105
01:18:22,984 --> 01:18:25,714
it was gonna take more than
some nosedive to stop Rexxx.

1106
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:27,778
Right, buddy?

1107
01:18:27,855 --> 01:18:29,755
Eat up; you need your energy.

1108
01:18:29,824 --> 01:18:31,814
So, what are you
guys gonna do first?

1109
01:18:31,892 --> 01:18:33,223
- Mmm...
- Huh? Tell me.

1110
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:34,727
First, a press conference.

1111
01:18:34,796 --> 01:18:36,957
Yeah, I got the campaign
all figured out.

1112
01:18:37,031 --> 01:18:38,361
How about this?

1113
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:40,922
<i>Rexxx- the Resurrection.</i>

1114
01:18:42,002 --> 01:18:43,493
What?

1115
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:45,834
Okay, a little esoteric.

1116
01:18:45,906 --> 01:18:47,373
Yeah. What about...?

1117
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,636
What about all those things
you said at the memorial? Huh?

1118
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:55,113
The playing Frisbee, hiking,
treating him like a real dog?

1119
01:18:55,182 --> 01:18:56,114
Mm...!

1120
01:18:56,183 --> 01:18:57,114
Remember?

1121
01:18:57,183 --> 01:18:58,673
Listen, I know Rexxx, okay?

1122
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,548
He doesn't want to be a real dog.

1123
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:02,588
He wants to be a star.

1124
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:05,351
He's dying to jump back
into action, right, boy?

1125
01:19:07,726 --> 01:19:09,216
Uh-huh...

1126
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:12,526
and speaking of that, I got
a little surprise for you.

1127
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,567
Some old friends, you know.

1128
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,192
Chill, dude.

1129
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:52,394
It's just a couple of sirens.

1130
01:19:52,469 --> 01:19:54,231
Get your head in the game, man.

1131
01:19:56,739 --> 01:20:00,300
I mean, come on, buddy,
the betties are waiting.

1132
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:08,349
Rexxx!

1133
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:14,917
- What was that?
- Where'd he come from?!

1134
01:20:30,505 --> 01:20:32,472
Hey, guys, look!

1135
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,270
You're not gonna believe this, Cap.

1136
01:20:46,686 --> 01:20:49,121
- Hey, come on, boy.
- That's my Dewey!

1137
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:50,655
Go, go, go!

1138
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:52,623
You can jump! Go!

1139
01:20:55,728 --> 01:20:57,217
Hey, look who's back!

1140
01:20:57,296 --> 01:20:58,821
- All right!
- Yeah!

1141
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:02,592
Actually, Joe, I do believe it.

1142
01:21:24,288 --> 01:21:27,349
MAN
I will not hesitate to kill you.

1143
01:21:27,426 --> 01:21:28,687
Hello?

1144
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,522
Dad?

1145
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,891
Anybody?

1146
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:47,033
Come on.

1147
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,544
Come on, pick up.

1148
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,079
This is Connor Fahey.

1149
01:21:51,147 --> 01:21:52,637
You're reached my cellphone.

1150
01:21:52,716 --> 01:21:54,580
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1151
01:21:59,989 --> 01:22:02,355
"Engine 55."

1152
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:06,085
"Harbor Fire"?

1153
01:22:06,161 --> 01:22:07,526
That's everything, Cap.

1154
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:09,359
...Pier 29, barge fire...

1155
01:22:09,431 --> 01:22:11,991
Come on, Joe, you got to give me a little more.

1156
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:14,899
I don't know what this junk is,
but it's getting hot fast.

1157
01:22:14,969 --> 01:22:16,904
I hear you, Cap, but no can do.

1158
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:20,236
I'm maxing you out on
the one that I have.

1159
01:22:20,308 --> 01:22:22,640
Roger that.
Maintaining deluge.

1160
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:36,783
- All right?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1161
01:22:36,858 --> 01:22:40,054
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah, we're good, Cap. Yeah.

1162
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:48,159
Guys?

1163
01:22:48,235 --> 01:22:49,896
Clear up, watch those pumps.

1164
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:51,231
We're on it.

1165
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:55,635
Good eye, Dewey.

1166
01:23:03,749 --> 01:23:05,944
Looks like I owe you an apology.

1167
01:23:06,018 --> 01:23:07,451
For what?

1168
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,180
Your mascot.

1169
01:23:09,254 --> 01:23:12,690
He isn't afraid of fire.

1170
01:23:13,926 --> 01:23:16,325
He isn't afraid of anything.

1171
01:23:16,394 --> 01:23:17,588
At this moment,

1172
01:23:17,662 --> 01:23:19,220
there are no indications
that anything toxic...

1173
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:21,730
- Hello?
J.J., my dad was right- I have to tell him.

1174
01:23:21,799 --> 01:23:23,665
Wait, wait, Shane, slow down.
What's going on?

1175
01:23:23,735 --> 01:23:25,999
No, no, listen.
I- Is your mom there?

1176
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:27,163
I can't get ahold of my dad.

1177
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:28,602
She's at the harbor.

1178
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:30,663
There's a monster blaze down there.

1179
01:23:30,741 --> 01:23:33,176
I know, I think it's arson.
I think they set it on purpose.

1180
01:23:33,244 --> 01:23:34,369
What do you mean? Who?

1181
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:36,470
Corbin Sellars...
and some other guy.

1182
01:23:36,547 --> 01:23:38,378
I heard 'em talking about
burning down buildings

1183
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:39,473
to make way for a stadium.

1184
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,176
They want to buy up all the land.

1185
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,343
But wait a second.

1186
01:23:42,419 --> 01:23:44,353
Why would they set fire
to the garbage barge?

1187
01:23:44,421 --> 01:23:45,615
It's not even land.

1188
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:47,178
Okay, that's true.

1189
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51,318
Hang on.

1190
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,132
Joe told me the whole
neighborhood's been boarded up

1191
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,969
or sold off, except for...

1192
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,804
Except for what?

1193
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,639
Parts that have been burned down.

1194
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,079
And the firehouse.

1195
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,209
Shane, what are you getting at?

1196
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:22,185
J.J., the barge is a decoy.

1197
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,918
The real target is here.
I- It's Dogpatch.

1198
01:24:28,796 --> 01:24:31,492
I think there's someone upstairs.

1199
01:24:31,565 --> 01:24:33,055
Shane, you got to leave now.

1200
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,726
Shane?

1201
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:37,669
Shane?!

1202
01:25:01,327 --> 01:25:02,884
Crap.

1203
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,520
Phew. Ow...

1204
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,102
Mm...

1205
01:26:00,616 --> 01:26:02,015
Shane...

1206
01:26:02,084 --> 01:26:04,609
what are you doing here?

1207
01:26:04,687 --> 01:26:07,155
You set the fire
that killed my uncle.

1208
01:26:07,223 --> 01:26:08,281
He died in the line of duty.

1209
01:26:08,357 --> 01:26:09,381
No, you did it.

1210
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,119
Hey, come on.

1211
01:26:11,193 --> 01:26:12,682
Put that down.

1212
01:26:18,566 --> 01:26:21,433
My dad trusted you, and you lied.

1213
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,936
Why'd you do it?
To build a football stadium

1214
01:26:24,005 --> 01:26:25,562
for Corbin Sellars?

1215
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:29,667
Shane, you're having trouble
separating fact from fiction.

1216
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:34,139
Put that down and we'll
talk about this outside.

1217
01:26:34,214 --> 01:26:36,376
I'll put it down
as soon as the cops get here,

1218
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:37,610
which will be any second now.

1219
01:26:37,684 --> 01:26:39,015
You're lying.

1220
01:26:39,086 --> 01:26:40,519
No!

1221
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,528
Okay, guys, keep it
on those hot spots.

1222
01:27:04,944 --> 01:27:06,206
What's wrong, boy?

1223
01:27:15,387 --> 01:27:17,446
Connor, it's my daughter.

1224
01:27:17,522 --> 01:27:19,080
You should hear this for yourself.

1225
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:21,249
Hi, J.J., go ahead.

1226
01:27:39,076 --> 01:27:41,066
Shane!

1227
01:27:43,547 --> 01:27:45,037
Shane!

1228
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:48,878
Can you hear me?!

1229
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:01,960
Shane!

1230
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,963
Shane!

1231
01:28:16,411 --> 01:28:17,435
Whoa!

1232
01:28:31,826 --> 01:28:33,088
All-all right, all right.

1233
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,457
You're... Nice doggy.

1234
01:28:34,528 --> 01:28:36,155
You're a nice doggy.
All right, stay back, now.

1235
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:39,430
Go, go.

1236
01:28:39,499 --> 01:28:40,659
Nice mutt. I...

1237
01:28:42,403 --> 01:28:44,063
Sit.

1238
01:28:47,474 --> 01:28:49,135
Stay!

1239
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,801
Come on...

1240
01:30:34,007 --> 01:30:36,407
Dewey?

1241
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:55,093
Let's get out of here.

1242
01:31:22,286 --> 01:31:23,446
Whoa, whoa!

1243
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:24,750
Watch out, Cap!

1244
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:29,782
Good job, rook.

1245
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,623
Come on.

1246
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,596
Come on, Dewey.

1247
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,843
Come on!

1248
01:31:56,085 --> 01:31:58,019
All the doors are locked!
There's no way in!

1249
01:31:58,087 --> 01:31:59,815
- Guys, the roof's gonna go!
- Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

1250
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:07,354
He's with Shane.
He's found Shane!

1251
01:32:09,531 --> 01:32:10,862
Pep!

1252
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,128
Shane!

1253
01:32:15,537 --> 01:32:17,800
It's no good!
It's not working!

1254
01:32:17,872 --> 01:32:20,306
Stand back!

1255
01:32:23,011 --> 01:32:25,478
Engine 55 to Dispatch.

1256
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:27,446
We have a fire in our engine house.

1257
01:32:27,515 --> 01:32:30,142
Persons believed inside.

1258
01:32:45,465 --> 01:32:47,899
Hold up! Hold up!

1259
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:48,934
I'm coming out!

1260
01:32:50,002 --> 01:32:51,230
Zach!

1261
01:32:51,303 --> 01:32:52,601
Where's Shane?

1262
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,007
I don't know.

1263
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:56,507
The place was in flames
when I got here.

1264
01:32:56,575 --> 01:32:57,974
I thought I heard
someone inside,

1265
01:32:58,043 --> 01:32:59,032
but I couldn't find him.

1266
01:32:59,111 --> 01:33:00,806
I tried.

1267
01:33:00,879 --> 01:33:02,540
I really tried.

1268
01:33:02,615 --> 01:33:04,242
Get him some oxygen.

1269
01:33:05,784 --> 01:33:07,081
Don't let him leave.

1270
01:33:10,823 --> 01:33:12,552
Let's hit that fire.

1271
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:15,759
Shane!

1272
01:33:15,827 --> 01:33:18,728
Dad! I'm in here!

1273
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:21,764
Dad!

1274
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:23,425
Are you all right?

1275
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:24,991
Dad, it's hard to breathe!

1276
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:26,729
Get back and stay low.

1277
01:33:36,446 --> 01:33:37,777
Come on!

1278
01:33:40,784 --> 01:33:43,184
Wait. Dad!

1279
01:33:43,253 --> 01:33:45,914
Dad, give me your ax;
I need to bust the hinges!

1280
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:48,616
If I break the glass,
the fire's gonna flash over.

1281
01:33:48,691 --> 01:33:50,455
Trust me.

1282
01:33:51,695 --> 01:33:53,184
Stand back.

1283
01:33:55,431 --> 01:33:57,922
Okay.

1284
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:06,807
The top one first.
The top one first.

1285
01:34:13,515 --> 01:34:15,278
It won't break!

1286
01:34:17,217 --> 01:34:19,243
Lay on it, Shane!

1287
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:23,486
Come on!
You can do it!

1288
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:27,826
Come on!

1289
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:31,661
Got it!

1290
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,035
Dad.

1291
01:34:45,211 --> 01:34:46,872
Come on, Dewey, get us out of here.

1292
01:34:52,351 --> 01:34:53,841
Hey, look!

1293
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:59,149
Joe, we got him!

1294
01:35:01,526 --> 01:35:03,357
We got to get him some air.

1295
01:35:06,499 --> 01:35:08,398
Here, just jump up.

1296
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:12,302
Easy.

1297
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:14,302
Take it easy.

1298
01:35:14,371 --> 01:35:15,599
It's all right.
It's all right.

1299
01:35:16,975 --> 01:35:17,873
Where's Zach Hayden?

1300
01:35:17,943 --> 01:35:19,342
Just relax.

1301
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,876
He set the fires, Dad.

1302
01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:24,847
He set all of them.

1303
01:35:24,915 --> 01:35:26,849
Even the mill fire.

1304
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:28,111
You were right.

1305
01:35:38,429 --> 01:35:39,793
Cap!

1306
01:35:43,466 --> 01:35:46,230
Is it true?
Is it true?

1307
01:35:46,302 --> 01:35:49,169
Connor, no one was
supposed to get hurt.

1308
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:51,207
- Cap!
- What about my brother?!

1309
01:35:51,274 --> 01:35:52,297
- What about my son?!
- No!

1310
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:53,705
It was Corbin Sellars!

1311
01:35:53,776 --> 01:35:55,176
He promised!

1312
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:04,175
Sorry.

1313
01:36:04,254 --> 01:36:05,242
My bad.

1314
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:08,255
Just give him to the cops.

1315
01:36:09,258 --> 01:36:12,920
Come on.
Come on, get up.

1316
01:36:12,994 --> 01:36:15,293
- We got one for you, Mac.
- Got it.

1317
01:36:15,364 --> 01:36:16,353
We'll take it from here.

1318
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:24,160
Hey.

1319
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,370
You really kept your cool in there.

1320
01:36:28,442 --> 01:36:30,306
Yeah.

1321
01:36:30,377 --> 01:36:31,571
Must be my DNA.

1322
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:58,869
Thanks.

1323
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,410
Thanks.

1324
01:37:06,846 --> 01:37:07,834
Okay?

1325
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:47,872
<i>Will Rexxx make his Broadway
debut in The Canine Mutiny?</i>

1326
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,247
Rexxx denies that.

1327
01:37:49,318 --> 01:37:50,946
Come on, Trey, throw us a bone here.

1328
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:52,544
Is it true there's
a tape of Rexxx

1329
01:37:52,622 --> 01:37:53,816
with Paris Hilton's Chihuahua?

1330
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:55,118
All I can say is

1331
01:37:55,191 --> 01:37:56,658
- Rexxx is prepping for
- Hey, Shane.

1332
01:37:56,726 --> 01:37:58,352
the most important role of his life.

1333
01:37:58,426 --> 01:38:00,759
Cool medal.

1334
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:03,264
Uh, it's okay, I guess.

1335
01:38:03,332 --> 01:38:04,696
So, my mom was wondering

1336
01:38:04,766 --> 01:38:08,668
if maybe you and your dad wanted
to go to Baskin Robbins with us.

1337
01:38:08,737 --> 01:38:10,500
Me?

1338
01:38:10,572 --> 01:38:12,199
With...

1339
01:38:12,274 --> 01:38:13,206
Yeah.

1340
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:15,334
Sure, I think he'd like that.

1341
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,343
Great.

1342
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:21,512
Hey.

1343
01:38:24,218 --> 01:38:26,379
It's time to say good-bye, chief.

1344
01:38:44,404 --> 01:38:46,895
I know your name is Rexxx...

1345
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:50,409
with, like,
a whole lot of X's,

1346
01:38:50,476 --> 01:38:53,377
but you'll always be Dewey to me.

1347
01:39:08,226 --> 01:39:11,753
I'll come visit you real soon.

1348
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:14,161
I don't think so, Shane.

1349
01:39:15,466 --> 01:39:16,660
- Trey...
- You promised him.

1350
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:19,562
I changed my mind.

1351
01:39:29,513 --> 01:39:31,447
After being
a real hero,

1352
01:39:31,515 --> 01:39:34,449
he'd never be happy
just acting like one.

1353
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:44,719
So long, wonder dog.

1354
01:39:44,794 --> 01:39:47,194
I'll come visit you real soon.

1355
01:40:27,335 --> 01:40:29,325
Take it easy, rookie!

1356
01:40:29,403 --> 01:40:31,496
That's my new bun warmer.

1357
01:40:31,571 --> 01:40:33,232
Got it, Joe buddy.

1358
01:40:33,306 --> 01:40:34,638
Joe buddy?

1359
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:38,405
Uh, Mr. Joe... buddy.

1360
01:40:38,478 --> 01:40:40,002
Sir.

1361
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,944
You got that right.

1362
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:45,849
Oh, my God.

1363
01:40:45,919 --> 01:40:48,182
It's the Ark of the Covenant.

1364
01:40:48,254 --> 01:40:49,653
No.

1365
01:40:49,722 --> 01:40:52,885
This is a fully water-jacketed
900 horsepower-

1366
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:55,483
"we ain't never arriving last
on the scene again. "

1367
01:40:55,561 --> 01:40:57,426
That's what this is.

1368
01:40:58,497 --> 01:40:59,987
Yeah.

1369
01:41:02,434 --> 01:41:03,459
I got it.

1370
01:41:03,536 --> 01:41:04,935
- Too late.
- I'm closest.

1371
01:41:05,004 --> 01:41:06,403
I'm biggest.

1372
01:41:06,472 --> 01:41:07,438
Dogpatch.

1373
01:41:07,505 --> 01:41:09,700
Proud home of Engine 55.

1374
01:41:09,774 --> 01:41:11,799
May I help you?

1375
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:21,575
There.

1376
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:29,957
Not bad, huh?

1377
01:41:31,228 --> 01:41:32,456
Uh.

1378
01:41:32,529 --> 01:41:34,520
- I guess we better go.
- Yep.

1379
01:41:34,598 --> 01:41:36,566
Engine 55, Ladder Eight, respond.

1380
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:38,191
Fuller Road near Hightown Mall.

1381
01:41:38,268 --> 01:41:39,234
Grass fire.

1382
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,329
Be advised, heavy smoke reported.

1383
01:41:42,406 --> 01:41:43,373
Caution on approach.

1384
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,338
Visibility poor.

1385
01:41:44,408 --> 01:41:45,806
What's wrong?

1386
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:56,745
Let's go, Dogpatch!

1387
01:41:59,387 --> 01:42:01,083
Suit up 40 seconds!

1388
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,522
All right!

1389
01:42:02,592 --> 01:42:03,650
- Yes!
- Awesome!

1390
01:42:06,428 --> 01:42:07,895
You're one strange dog.

1391
01:42:09,297 --> 01:42:10,558
Go get 'em, boy.

1392
01:42:27,481 --> 01:42:28,607
Hey, hey!

1393
01:42:28,682 --> 01:42:30,081
Looks like we got some backup!

1394
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:42,054
- All right, Dewey!
- Yeah, Dewey!

1395
01:42:42,128 --> 01:42:43,026
Good boy!

1396
01:42:46,132 --> 01:42:48,429
Dispatch, Engine 55 is en route.

1397
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,934
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

1398
01:42:50,136 --> 01:42:52,127
<i>And that's the tale of the dog</i>

1399
01:42:52,205 --> 01:42:53,263
<i>who fell from the sky.</i>

1400
01:42:53,339 --> 01:42:56,068
<i>He wasn't rich anymore</i>

1401
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:59,009
<i>or powerful or pampered.</i>

1402
01:42:59,078 --> 01:43:01,170
<i>But for the first time ever,</i>

1403
01:43:01,246 --> 01:43:03,510
<i>he was a real dog.</i>

1404
01:43:03,582 --> 01:43:04,981
<i>He was my dog.</i>
