1
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,540
Globodyne is a consolidator
of media properties.

2
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,352
Globodyne is a consolidator of media
properties. Consolidator. Oh, no!

3
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:14,364
Globodyne's a consolidator of
media properties and data retrieval...

4
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,573
...with a focus in fiber-optic
content provision.

5
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,399
It's basically a synergy
of Web-based...

6
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,729
...and platform-based
UNIX-driven delivery systems.

7
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,836
Okay, I made that last part up.

8
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:28,511
We spent months on this trip.
I just assumed...

9
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:31,133
...that you knew you needed
a passport to get into Russia.

10
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,960
But if I should have told you,
then I'm really sorry, Mr. Fairbanks.

11
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:44,221
It's not my fault airport security
strip-searched you, Mr. Fairbanks.

12
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:48,645
I mean, maybe you shouldn't have
made that joke. You know?

13
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,051
Hon? Fire.

14
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:53,380
You know what, I'm going to
load you up with drink coupons.

15
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,672
Blanca? Can you make this little man
something to eat?

16
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:09,957
Are you sure about this?

17
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,577
The trainer said it's just
a minor annoyance.

18
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:15,877
He said it just reminds him
to be a little less vocal.

19
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,997
- Hey, Dick.
- Morning, Joe.

20
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,656
That a new car?

21
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,636
It's the new Mercedes S500.

22
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:04,042
You can only special-order
these from Germany.

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,686
- How's it run?
- Well, it's a Mercedes.

24
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:10,762
Check this out.

25
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,332
Mercedes, on.

26
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:17,477
Yeah? Well, watch this.

27
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:20,363
Beemer, sit. Stay.

28
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:23,080
Play dead. Good boy.

29
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:26,183
That's cute, Dick. Mercedes, off.

30
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:54,023
"It has come to our attention
that certain departments...

31
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,096
...have begun to run into situations."
Situations.

32
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,305
The big boys want
to see you upstairs.

33
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,575
Which floor? Twentieth?

34
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:03,368
Twenty-sixth?

35
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:05,484
Thirty-second?

36
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,782
- Not the 51st?
- Yes.

37
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,850
Congratulations, Mr. Harper.

38
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:16,530
- Go ahead and wrap this up.
- Okay.

39
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,836
- How do I look?
- Great.

40
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,792
- Anything in my teeth?
- No.

41
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,745
I need a paper bag.

42
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:29,426
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey, Dick. Morning.

43
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,009
It is, isn't it? Sure is.

44
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,497
Hey, did you... ?
Did you hear about Bill?

46
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:40,814
- Oh, yeah. That's.... That's wild.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:45,741
Yeah. I wonder.... I wonder
who's going to take his place.

48
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,426
That's the big mystery.

49
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,445
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,949
- You getting off?
- Not this time, Oz.

51
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,255
Son of a bitch!

52
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,721
That's it.

53
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,345
Hello. I'm...

54
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,731
...Dick Harper, and I'm here
to see Jack McAllister.

55
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:12,786
Oh, well, that's him now, sorry.
He had to step out.

56
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,050
Dick.

57
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:19,834
Damn glad to finally see you
up here.

58
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,898
Hey, man.

59
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:29,333
- Frank Bascombe, CFO.
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

60
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,771
Nice to meet you.
Listen, Dick. Dick.

61
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,001
Jack's very sorry that he couldn't
be here to congratulate you.

62
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,582
Well, on becoming the new
VP of Communication.

63
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,892
Are you--?

64
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:43,450
- Holy.... Thank you.
- No, no, no.

65
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:46,168
But also, he wanted to invite you
to his house...

66
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:49,238
...for an orientation meeting
on Monday morning.

67
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,657
Dick? Ann's got the address.

68
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:01,436
All right. Sure, I'll get that.
Okay. Ann?

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,942
- Thanks.
- Sure.

70
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,796
And thank you...

71
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,195
...Frank.

72
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,514
Cool exit.

73
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,852
How do you like your eggs?

74
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,695
Pardon me!

75
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,921
Ours is an age
of unmeasured prosperity,

76
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,577
Oh, yeah.

77
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:32,926
- You know what?
- What?

78
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,782
You should quit your job.

79
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:36,831
- Quit my job?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,353
Do you even know what you're getting
paid? I mean, I can't quit my job.

81
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,688
Well, not specifically, but....

82
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:46,750
Bob got VP last month,
he's making 1 50 plus bonuses.

83
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,725
Come on, you want to spend
more time with Billy.

84
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:51,965
Do it. Just-- Come on.

85
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:54,271
Do it. Do it. Quit your job.

86
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,127
We must never become
a winner-take-all society,

87
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,660
- You know what we should do?
- What?

88
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,853
We should have sex...

89
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:04,162
...on Saturday.

90
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,439
I'll buy candles.

91
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:08,671
I'll pick up the new Starbucks sampler
featuring Sade.

92
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:12,515
Oh, you animal.
That is going to be so wild.

93
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,021
Yeah.

94
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,250
Thank you.

95
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:33,086
Just make yourself at home.

96
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,753
Right.

97
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,011
Dick.

98
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah. Mr. McAllister.

99
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:53,188
- Dick. Hey, call me Jack.
- Likewise.

100
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,668
With my name. Dick, I mean.

101
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,776
Man. Dick Harper.

102
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,408
Dick Harper.

103
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,637
Dick Harper playing the harp.
Harpo Marx playing the jew's-harp.

104
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,448
D.H. DH.

105
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,469
You're my designated hitter.

106
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,643
I need you to step up
into the batter's box...

107
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,720
...and knock one out
of the ballpark for me.

108
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,517
- Gone.
- You ever have a nickname?

109
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,233
Well, it was....

110
00:09:19,884 --> 00:09:21,640
Squirt. The Squirt.

111
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,652
Something about how I was
conceived, I don't know.

112
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,130
We going to think of something.
Have trouble finding the place?

113
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,425
No, sir. By the way, what a absolutely
beautiful hour-- Home you have.

114
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,377
So then my lawyer says
to her lawyer:

115
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,291
"lf she thinks she's getting that yacht,
she's a little dingy."

116
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,418
He always-- He loves that one.

117
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,232
The point is
that we need somebody...

118
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,405
...who projects confidence
in this position.

119
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:48,100
We've seen how
you handle yourself.

120
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,605
You've been a great cheerleader
for this company.

121
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,228
So we were thinking that....

122
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,822
- Well, you go ahead and tell him.
- No, you go ahead.

123
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:02,089
What's up, guys? Come on.
Don't hold out on me here. What?

124
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:04,459
We want you to go on
Money Life this afternoon...

125
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,762
...and announce
our quarterly projections.

126
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,562
You're the guy.
You're the guy we have faith in.

127
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,671
You can get our positive spin
out there.

128
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:17,160
Right. Positive spin.

129
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,216
These are fickle times, Dick.

130
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,929
We need to stick together
as a team.

131
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,387
Like my daddy always used to say....

132
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,606
Well, you can count on me, sir.

133
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,039
I mean, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

134
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,387
- Thank you.
- How were those eggs Florentine?

135
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:44,048
- Best I've ever had.
- Good answer.

136
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,836
I'm on the plane right now!

137
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,687
Do you know what's sitting
in front of me? Do you know?

138
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,754
A kosher meal! A kosher meal!

139
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,121
How many times do I need to tell
you? ! I don't need a kosher meal!

140
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm Episcopalian!

141
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:04,237
No-- No, you, miss-- You--
No, you grow up!

142
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:06,161
For-- No, you, miss--

143
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:09,358
Phyllis, can l... ?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

144
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,729
- Here's a yell!
- It's personal.

145
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:16,210
- Never actually had makeup on.
- I'm happy for you.

146
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:18,959
- Hi.
- Hi.

147
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,843
- Where's Sam?
- Washington.

148
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:24,523
These are your talking points.
They were just faxed over.

149
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,582
And Sam is on the line for you.

150
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,173
Hello, Mr, Harper,

151
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:31,638
Hey, Sam. How you doing?
Nice talking to you.

152
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,970
I thought you were going to be here.

153
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,307
- Me too, I hear it's beautiful there,
- That's the thing--

154
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,380
- Okay, Dick, we're on in five,
- Yep, sure.

155
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,591
- -three, two....

156
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:52,245
Today we're talking with the new VP
of Communications at Globodyne...

157
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,448
... Dick Harper,
How you doing, Dick?

158
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,559
Just terrific, Sam.
Thank you for asking.

159
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,736
And so is Globodyne, by the way.

160
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:02,773
Now, Dick, tell me,
what is the shareholder to make...

161
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:05,938
...of the fact that Jack McAllister,
your CEO...

162
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,920
...has unloaded a considerable share
of his stocks?

163
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,981
I think CEOs sell their stocks
for many reasons, Sam.

164
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,418
Both professional and personal.

165
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:22,961
Actually, over the past year, Jack
McAllister has sold 80 percent...

166
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:24,920
...of his holdings
through shell companies,

167
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,897
Now, how do you explain that?

168
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,823
The reasons for doing something
like that would be--

169
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:35,769
Losing you there. Hold on.

170
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,064
The reasons for doing something
like that would be.... Could be many.

171
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:41,876
Both....

172
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,476
There's also talk of some of
the Globodyne portfolio documents...

173
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:48,660
... being subpoenaed,

174
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,855
Specifically those of your CFO,
Frank Bascombe,

175
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,495
Now, joining us with his insights,
is presidential hopeful Ralph Nader,

176
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,218
Really?

177
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:04,243
Hi, Ralph. Big fan, love your stuff.

178
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:07,229
I wish I could say the same,
I don't know how you sleep at night,

179
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,088
Corporations like Globodyne
pervert the American dream,

180
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,368
The super-rich get richer,

181
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,959
You are a disgrace,

182
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:20,277
Ralph, I don't know where
you're getting your statistics.

183
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:23,607
I can only say that, in my estimation,
Globodyne is transparent.

184
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,041
We'd be more than willing
to share any and all documentation.

185
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:34,399
What is going on?

186
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,927
Can somebody tell me
what the heck is--?

187
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,239
Hey, there's a fi-- Somebody should--

188
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,094
Okay.

189
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,722
This can't be good.

190
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,898
Out of my way!

191
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,138
- Hey, that's my focus!
- My focus!

192
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:54,135
You're not even from this floor!
Help! Security!

193
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,474
What's going on?

194
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:04,472
Oh, so Dick finally wants to know
what's going on.

195
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:07,133
Frank?

196
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:11,741
Methinks somebody made
a boo-boo.

197
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,690
Maybe we didn't know how to
use Quicken. Yeah, that could be it.

198
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:18,848
Frank. Frank. Try to focus. Okay?
What's happening to Globodyne?

199
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:22,176
- Globodyne?
- Yeah, what happened, Frank?

200
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,530
- We took our shifting losses...
- Yeah?

201
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:30,146
- ... and we put them into businesses...
- Yeah, yeah?

202
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,769
...that we actually owned.

203
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,657
And then the balance sheet...

204
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,926
...it showed profit.

205
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,298
But actually, there was...

206
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:41,662
...debt.

207
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,259
What the hell? !

208
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,045
You're sick.

209
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,958
- I want you to hit me.
- Frank, let go of me now.

210
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,232
- I want you to hit me.
- Let go, you're scaring me.

211
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,734
- Hit me.
- Frank! Get off!

212
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:57,917
And I have the 6000 greatest
partners a man could ask for,

213
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,914
Mr. McAllister?

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,508
I don't know what to tell you.

215
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,510
We're just a cell in a much larger
organism called the global economy.

216
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,707
Weak companies have to die so that
stronger companies can get stronger.

217
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:19,426
- It's just nature.
- Nature? What?

218
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:21,863
You ever read Walden Pond?
It's all in there.

219
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:23,814
Hey, you send him a copy
of the tape.

220
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,800
What about the other employees, sir?

221
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,685
They're going to be fine.
Don't go there.

222
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:30,337
This is America,
the land of opportunity.

223
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:36,167
I don't know, sir. With all due respect,
this doesn't feel right.

224
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:40,641
Step away from the rotors now, boy.
They going to chop your head clean off.

225
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,963
Honey? I'm home.

226
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:12,421
Oh, and the vice president is home!

227
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,434
I see you got them digging
the hot tub.

228
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:22,445
I know. Yes, I called the guy.
They came right out.

229
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:28,072
- That almost never happens.
- I know. We're so lucky.

230
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,062
Dinner's ready!

231
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:41,895
- Look at it!
- Oh, my gosh!

232
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,998
Look! I did it and it's perfect!

233
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:48,997
My gosh! That could feed
a family of four.

234
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,033
I mean.... I-- In my--
Look at that, Billy.

235
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm surprised you left off the hooves.

236
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:01,096
You know, before we get into that,
I have some wonderful news.

237
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,120
Mama quit her job!

238
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,173
- I did. I did, I did!
- You did?

239
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:11,186
- Isn't that great?
- My gosh! That's incredible!

240
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,607
Oh, the timing of it, it was just
beautiful, Dick. And, oh, thank you.

241
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,297
I just-- I just did it!

242
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,019
No. Oh, boy.

243
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:20,463
And now, you know what...

244
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:23,016
...I can spend so much more time
with my beautiful boy.

245
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:26,766
- Yeah.
- Now, what's your news, big Mr. VP?

246
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:31,122
I have something
of an announcement to make.

247
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,911
It turns out that a very wonderful
opportunity has just presented itself...

248
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,855
...in the form of me...

249
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:43,410
...not necessarily working
at Globodyne anymore.

250
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,754
Were you fired?

251
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:49,713
I wasn't fired. Globodyne tanked.

252
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:51,375
- Dick!
- Jeez. "Fired."

253
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,160
What do you mean?
How could that happen?

254
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,291
They just gave you
a promotion. And--

255
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:00,078
There is nothing to worry about.
I'll get my severance...

256
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,253
...money from my pension.
We're fine.

257
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,932
I am a winner.
Billy, tell your father he's a winner.

258
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:11,476
See?

259
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,990
- Hey! Our first day at home together.
- Hey.

260
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,479
Let's have a big family breakfast.

261
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,753
Oh, gosh, honey,
Billy's already gone to school...

262
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,506
...and I got to meet him for that
Mommy & Me lunch thing.

263
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,128
What are you going to do?
Are you going to look for a job?

264
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:37,843
You know what,
I think I might just take this day.

265
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:40,659
Great. I do. I think you should.

266
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:43,639
But, listen, I got to go pick up
that thing at the thing.

267
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,319
Baby, I got to go. I'm sorry. Sorry.

268
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:48,856
Okay, good.

269
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,763
I'll see you later, baby.
Have a really good time.

270
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,175
Bye.

271
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,591
Okay.

272
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,349
Cheers.

273
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,711
Former CFO Frank Bascombe
has been indicted...

274
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,497
...on charges of fraud
and money laundering,

275
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:52,445
Lead investigators say all roads
lead to Mr, Bascombe,

276
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:53,817
And no evidence has yet...

277
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,529
...to link former CEO Jack McAllister
to this growing scandal,

278
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,371
We've all had to make sacrifices,

279
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:04,378
I sold my place in Jackson Ho--
No,

280
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:07,228
- Martha 's Vineyard,
- Oh, shut up!

281
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,069
God.

282
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,980
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Can't be that bad, can it, bud?

283
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,513
God!

284
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:32,924
Oh, you know it.

285
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:36,384
So can I send you a résumé?

286
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,423
No, I got a terrific one here.
You'll love it.

287
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,409
Do you have a fax number?

288
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:46,717
So there are no new openings
at this time. Right.

289
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,988
And what about the near future?

290
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:54,073
Yeah. Sure. I could stop calling.

291
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:55,709
This afternoon. Okay.

292
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,041
I'll be there. Bye.

293
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,763
Hon. I got an interview
at Pyramid Tech.

294
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,862
I was really starting
to wonder there.

295
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,104
Hey!

296
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,574
Hold on!

297
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,245
- Dick.
- Oz.

298
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:40,969
Want to go get a drink?

299
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,271
- You buying?
- Sure.

300
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,735
- Harper?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,133
- Dick Harper!
- Yeah.

302
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:52,230
You don't have to stand in this line.
Come on with me.

303
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:55,462
Hey, Oz. Rain check.

304
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:58,026
Son of a bitch!

305
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,022
Okay, rip it out. Get it on the truck.

306
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:05,165
Hector, what's going on? What--?

307
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:07,628
- What happened?
- Your check go bouncy-bounce.

308
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:10,409
But it's okay, I heard what happened
to your husband.

309
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,909
Not everybody could afford
landscaping like this, eh?

310
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:16,138
- Hector, please.
- I am sorry, Miss Jane.

311
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:20,614
Oh, no, no, no. No! No, no!

312
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:23,848
This is all--
Everything, it's all wrong.

313
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,904
I want this out. Roll it all up.

314
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:28,999
I ordered Kentucky bluegrass.

315
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,786
This is green.

316
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:35,693
- Dick Harper! What a stroke of luck.
- Oh, jeez.

317
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,549
I'm sorry, I don't remember
where you know me from.

318
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,274
Oh, I don't know you.

319
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:47,468
I just saw you spaz out Money Life.
Oh, my God, that was great.

320
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,707
Hey, some of the fells would
like to meet you.

321
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:52,394
- Hello, Dick.
- I can't believe it's really you.

322
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:55,945
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Did you bring your statistics?

323
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,889
We have an expression around
here when someone makes a mistake.

324
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,611
It's called "pulling a Dick."

325
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,089
Up high, up high.

326
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,550
Have you seen
DickHarperIsATool. com?

327
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:07,723
Oh, you're going to love this.
This is dynamite.

328
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,990
I don't know where
you're getting your statistics,

329
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:14,995
Who is that? Who is that?
It's you! It's you!

330
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,491
Can we just get on
with the job interview?

331
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:18,765
This guy!

332
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:22,281
We couldn't hire you!
We just want to take your picture.

333
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:25,802
Okay, everybody, little bit closer.
One, two, three.

334
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,053
Statistics!

335
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,284
Hey, how'd it go?

336
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,210
Oh, not too bad.

337
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,832
It was good practice.

338
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,499
- What are you doing?
- Going through our finances.

339
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,783
I'm not sure...

340
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,398
...but it seems that we may be
in a little bit of a pickle, Dick.

341
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:52,363
Well, sure, our financial bounce-back
has taken a bit longer than expected...

342
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,771
...but, you know, that's natural.

343
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:58,351
Our lawn was repossessed today.
I didn't even know they could do that.

344
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,797
I think maybe it's time you start
thinking about accepting something...

345
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,270
...a little bit lower
than a vice-presidency.

346
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:08,399
No. Took me 1 5 years to get
a VP-ship. If I step back now...

347
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:10,162
...I'll lose everything I worked for.

348
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,783
We're just going to have to suck it up
for a couple months.

349
00:25:12,952 --> 00:25:15,703
In a couple of months,
we'll be declaring bankruptcy.

350
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:18,484
- Oh, come on.
- Our savings--

351
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:22,162
Look. Our savings
was in Globodyne stock.

352
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:25,745
Jesus. And, look, our pension
was in Globodyne stock.

353
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:29,362
Everything was in Globodyne stock!
All of it!

354
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,042
The lawn is covered with dirt!
It is so much fun!

355
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,282
I have made a mud man!

356
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,870
Now, Billy is looking
at the glass half full.

357
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:42,872
Hon, relax. We've got 600 grand.

358
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:46,097
- Where?
- We're standing in it. Our house.

359
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:51,060
Since Globodyne, the local
property market crashed, Dick.

360
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:56,793
If we sold our house today,
we would owe the bank 1 50 grand.

361
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,562
I knew it. It was churning in my gut...

362
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:03,667
- ... and I didn't listen.
- It would be okay.

363
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:07,033
You said we could afford this house
and take out a second mortgage...

364
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,586
...so that we could put in the pool,
redo the kitchen...

365
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,830
- I said that.
- ... and now we are on the verge...

366
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,070
...of losing the house.
If we lose the house...

367
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:18,361
...then Billy loses all sense of security
and later, never have a relationship...

368
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:20,599
...so he'll just spend his whole life
just alone.

369
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:24,028
There he'll be, just alone,
nobody with him, just like a bum.

370
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,158
Hon? Hon? You need a paper bag?

371
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:30,428
You said everything
was going to be okay.

372
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:39,575
Mr. Dick! Something wrong
with the electricity!

373
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:44,985
Well, if you're going to do it,
be the best.

374
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:53,177
Hi, I'm Lucy, and I'll be your Kostmart
training team leader.

375
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:55,516
I am so happy to welcome you
to the Kostmart team.

376
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,655
Now, we work hard here,
but we play hard also.

377
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,680
I think we're
going to have a good time here...

378
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:03,103
...because at Kostmart,
we're more than a store. We're family.

379
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:05,854
Now, before we get started...

380
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:08,440
...I am going to need you all
to piss in one of these cups.

381
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:21,919
- It's taking a little while.
- Just relax.

382
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,019
I've been married for 20 years.
I know what it looks like.

383
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,586
You want me to get you a cola?

384
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:31,070
It's just hard to do
while you're standing there watching.

385
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:33,920
I could sell you my pee for $1 00.

386
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,953
I been off the pipe for two years.
Thank you, Jesus.

387
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:42,242
Unfortunately, we don't have any
positions available in Pilates or yoga.

388
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,889
But we are looking
for a Jeet Kun Do instructor.

389
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:49,152
Yes. I mean, that's-- Oh, my--
I thought--

390
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,652
I didn't even-- I didn't say that?

391
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,952
I was born doing...

392
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,939
...that.

393
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,099
- Hi, welcome to Kostmart.
- Watch.

394
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:01,407
Hi! Welcome to Kostmart.

395
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:05,120
Check out our makeup counter
on aisle 1 2B.

396
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:10,273
Welcome to Kostmart. Check out our
CDs. Garth Brooks on sale, aisle 51.

397
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:17,761
Welcome to Kostmart.
Your local gun emporium.

398
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,228
Aisle 42, hunting gear.

399
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,759
And the next thing I knew,
I was wearing it.

400
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:26,307
- Well, Jane.
- Hey, Veronica.

401
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,839
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

402
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,407
I didn't know
you worked out here.

403
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:34,343
Welcome to Kostmart. I hope
you'll take a trip by the deli today...

404
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,545
...for a complimentary cube
of jalapeño cheddar.

405
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:40,161
I'm lactose intolerant.
Where do you keep the cigarettes?

406
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,216
Behind the counter.

407
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:45,280
- But I'm not sure that's a good--
- Dick? You missed one.

408
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:50,759
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Wait. Ma'am? Ma'am. Welcome!

409
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:52,995
Here we go. Hi. Hi.

410
00:28:54,314 --> 00:29:00,196
My name's Jane, and I'll be your
instructor for beginners' Jin Ku Pow.

411
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,495
So let's just get right into it.
Here we go.

412
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:07,403
We're just going to loosen up
a little bit.

413
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:11,687
Here we go. Yeah.
There we go. And ho. And hit.

414
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:14,634
Excuse me! Ma'am!

415
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,027
And jab. And jab.

416
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,476
- Now I gotcha!
- Get this!

417
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:31,144
It's punch. And punch.
And step. And kick!

418
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:37,061
- It burns.
- I saw you eyeballing me...

419
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,335
...when I came in.
You were all up in my goodies.

420
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,054
You know something?
I'm glad you fired me.

421
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:50,500
How's a person supposed to survive
and feed their family on that salary?

422
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,943
It's a lease.

423
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:06,190
I don't know why we didn't think
of this before. It's such a good idea.

424
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,654
We're sorry we couldn't pay you.
We have no money.

425
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:11,305
It's okay. Your son
is very important to me.

426
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:14,156
I would do anything for him,
Mr. Richard.

427
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:18,030
In the meantime, thank you
for letting us pay you in appliances.

428
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,141
Yeah.

429
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,728
Congratulations.

430
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,026
Hey, think about this:

431
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:29,227
How many places you'll see
on one tank of gas.

432
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:33,705
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

433
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:54,131
Here it is!

434
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,763
We can live without it. People
have lived without these things.

435
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:05,867
- There goes the boxing match.
- You can go to a bar.

436
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,564
It's rigged anyway.

437
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,405
What are you doing
with the television?

438
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:19,277
- You're going to sell it!
- No, no. Billy!

439
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:20,591
God! Just go, Dick!

440
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:22,733
Damn it, Blanca, grab him!

441
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,067
- Papa! Mama!
- Go! Go, go!

442
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,784
- Don't take my Telemundo!
- Go! Go! Hurry, hurry!

443
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:31,733
Sponge Roberto SquarePantalones!

444
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:35,637
- God! Just go, go, go!
- I want my MTV Latino.

445
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:46,831
Dick, what are we going to do?

446
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,166
We've run out of things to sell.

447
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,357
Well....

448
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,260
- There's always prostitution.
- Dick.

449
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:00,630
I mean me.

450
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,217
We just got to look
for more work, that's all.

451
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:08,088
There is no work, Dick. There's
6000 other people out of work.

452
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:10,257
Vice presidents are working
at Burger King.

453
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:13,295
It's going to be fine.
All we need is $400...

454
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,209
...and we're good for another month.
This is just temporary. So stay calm.

455
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,312
- And don't panic!
- Damn.

456
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:29,654
Are you going to sit in the dirt hole
all night long?

457
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,241
- Come on, hon., let's get out.
- Yeah.

458
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:35,544
I'm starting to turn
into a raisin anyway.

459
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:39,161
What's the matter?
You look sad, Richard.

460
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:41,881
Blanca, call me Dick.

461
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,559
Well, Blanca,
there's just no jobs out there.

462
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:51,798
I have a cousin who might be able
to help you find some work.

463
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,617
It's not much. But it's something.

464
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,790
I need one guy
who knows how to paint.

465
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,138
That's me!

466
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:22,011
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I'm here!

467
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,769
Hey, I was here first!

468
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,936
Congratulations, güero.
You almost got that one.

469
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:37,182
Don't worry. There'll be more.

470
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,345
That thing is already starting
to swell up like a balloon.

471
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,553
Is it noticeable?

472
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,151
- No.
- Just a little bit.

473
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:47,322
Did you see that?
We should report that guy.

474
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:51,063
Report him!

475
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,723
- We should report him.
- Let's report him.

476
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,233
I do it for you.

477
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,720
This is a new drug
in the same family of Botox.

478
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,672
We don't expect any problems.

479
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:03,552
Your check for $1 4 is waiting for you
at the front desk...

480
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:08,352
...and we think you are all
going to look beautiful. Okay.

481
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,395
Now, if you can begin
by just filling out those forms.

482
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,465
Those are insurance waivers.

483
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:17,760
And then you'll find a list
of various aspects of your face.

484
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,965
Go ahead and check off
anything that you think...

485
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:22,466
...you might want to improve on
just a little bit.

486
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,073
Are deuces still wild?

487
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,214
No.

488
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:31,298
I'm screwed.

489
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:38,017
Well, I think I'm going to go, guys.
Carlos. Eduardo. Gustavo.

490
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,502
Pleasure talking to you
the last couple hours.

491
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,874
Hey, congratulations
on the baby too.

492
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:47,204
- INS!
- All right, hold it right there.

493
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,506
- INS?
- Hold it right there.

494
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:51,460
You're not going anywhere.

495
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,598
- Hold it right there!
- You've got to be kidding.

496
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:54,815
Oh, this is hilarious.

497
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:57,024
You guys know the drill.
Let's see some papers.

498
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:58,621
- Against the wall.
- Papers.

499
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,791
Where's my wallet?
Where'd my wallet go? This is--

500
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,711
- No, no. I dropped my wallet.
- Back up.

501
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,847
- Oh, these are doozies.
- What do you got?

502
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:11,240
We got a Don Johnson,
Elvis and Opie Taylor.

503
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,605
- Dick Harper, you're free to go.
- Dick Harper?

504
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:17,730
That's me, Dick Harper. Hey, that
guy's not Dick Harper! Whoa, jeez!

505
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:18,977
We don't want problems.

506
00:35:19,145 --> 00:35:22,146
You're making a serious mistake
in judgment. I am an American.

507
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,004
You got to work on
your accent, Pablo.

508
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:26,025
Could we--? You want to talk
to my wife, Jane?

509
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:28,358
Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah.
We'll call your wife, "Yane."

510
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:31,621
We'll ask her if you're American.
And we'll call my wife, Yennifer...

511
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:34,503
- ... and his wife, Yaqueline, too.
- It's ringing, it's ringing!

512
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:43,970
No, wait! I'm an American!
I swear to God!

513
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:46,082
- Hey, watch your language.
- Get in there.

514
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,553
Okay, we have our results.

515
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:53,188
Negative side effects with only
three of 1 4 participants in the study.

516
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:56,008
- That's not bad. Let's see, now.
- Hello?

517
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:58,376
- Jill? Hi, Jill.
- Dick, what--?

518
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,581
Oh, honey, I can barely under--

519
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:03,204
What--? Why are you doing
that accent?

520
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:14,092
Holy hell!

521
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:16,238
I did this little cosmetics test...

522
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:20,080
...and I had a little reaction.
Is it really that bad?

523
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,920
No, it's not so bad.
It's just different.

524
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,123
Dick, can we talk about this
some other time?

525
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,299
Oh, yeah. Come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go!

526
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,670
I got to go in. I got to go to bed.

527
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,129
You coming?

528
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:59,504
I think I'm going to sit in the car...

529
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:04,211
...and think for a while.

530
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:09,676
Okay.

531
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,903
Don't think for too long,
we got to get up early.

532
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:17,104
Soup kitchens stop serving at 8.

533
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:46,867
You're still pretty.

534
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,845
I'm not playing anymore.

535
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,155
I've just about had it!

536
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:10,074
Sorry.

537
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:20,289
O my God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

538
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,232
It's okay. I'm putting it back.

539
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:26,111
I'm putting it back! It's okay.

540
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:59,132
Hon, what happened?

541
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:03,451
I got the lawn back.

542
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,476
Got the... ?

543
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,638
Oh, Dick.

544
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,612
It's beautiful.

545
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:22,877
Honey.

546
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:29,663
Oh, Dick, I love you.

547
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:31,687
I love you.

548
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:45,194
Are these too big for my face?

549
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,097
Well, now you look like
the Unabomber.

550
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:56,522
Good.

551
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,726
What are you doing
with Billy's squirt gun?

552
00:42:59,406 --> 00:43:02,222
We followed the rules
and we got screwed.

553
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,619
We were good people,
honest people...

554
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,922
...and we got screwed.

555
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:08,838
Damn it!

556
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,846
What are you going to do now,
you going to rob a bank?

557
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,528
We got screwed.
Over and over again, hon.

558
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,867
I stole the lawn back,
and you know what happened?

559
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:19,722
We have a lawn now.

560
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,634
Yeah, but-- Okay.

561
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:25,062
We're all just cavemen...

562
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:27,949
...trying to protect
our little patch of land.

563
00:43:28,113 --> 00:43:29,804
Well, now I have a club...

564
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:32,522
...and I'm going to take what I need.

565
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,502
Maybe you should steal
some Prozac.

566
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:39,913
Keep laughing, Jane.
Keep laughing, okay?

567
00:43:40,082 --> 00:43:41,391
I'll be back soon...

568
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:44,402
- ... with the loot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm coming.

569
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:46,733
- Not going to miss this for the world.
- Suit yourself.

570
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:49,899
Besides, you're going to need
a good wheelman.

571
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,489
Okay, that's it, joke's over.
Let's go home.

572
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,903
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

573
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:04,239
- We haven't done the caper yet.
- Wow, okay, you--

574
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:06,706
Then-- Then let's do it before,
you know...

575
00:44:06,868 --> 00:44:08,624
...we die of
carbon-monoxide poisoning.

576
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:10,576
When you're in there,
get me some Sno-Caps.

577
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:13,363
Oh, no, no, no, Raisinets,
Raisinets. I want Raisinets.

578
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:17,452
Hon, your thingamabob.

579
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,858
- I know, I know.
- All right.

580
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:24,878
And don't forget
to kill the witnesses, hon.

581
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:27,477
Okay.

582
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,605
Hi.

583
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,438
Brain freeze.

584
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,090
You ever get that?

585
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:44,058
One Brain freeze. Anything else?

586
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:49,623
Yeah. Yeah, I got something else...

587
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,610
...right here.

588
00:45:54,172 --> 00:45:56,245
Hey, Jake, take a break.
I got this one.

589
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:04,633
That'll be 1.29, please.

590
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:18,782
1.29.

591
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:24,502
Go! Jane, go! Just go!

592
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:38,012
Oh, God. You did it?

593
00:46:38,177 --> 00:46:39,605
Oh, there that is.

594
00:46:39,776 --> 00:46:42,876
- That was wild. That was wild!
- You actually robbed that place?

595
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,943
No, but I had a slushie
and I didn't even pay for it.

596
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:52,537
- What?
- Well, then our problems...

597
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:54,331
...are pretty much over.

598
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:58,327
Jane, just drive the car, okay?
We'll find another place, okay?

599
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:07,615
Give me your money!
Garth!

600
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,153
Dick?

601
00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:12,576
- Oh, my God.
- You remember Jane.

602
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:14,594
- She's in the car.
- Jane?

603
00:47:14,755 --> 00:47:16,065
- Hi, Garth.
- Hey, Jane.

604
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:18,432
- Hon, it's-- Garth.
- What's with this?

605
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,273
- From the barbeque.
- Harper, what are you--?

606
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:23,963
I had you going there.

607
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,856
Had me going?
You scared me to death.

608
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:27,482
- Yeah, well....
- You're a madman.

609
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:29,474
- We should hang out soon.
- All right.

610
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:31,905
Yeah, you want to hang out
with Garth soon, hon.?

611
00:47:32,068 --> 00:47:33,443
- All right.
- All right.

612
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:36,223
Drive. Just drive. Just drive the car.

613
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,877
- Okay, Dick.
- Okay.

614
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:49,988
My car's right there.

615
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,499
Get that for you, then. Okay.

616
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,710
- Thank you, sonny. Thank you.
- Oh, no, l--

617
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:57,984
Well, maybe.

618
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:02,206
Okay, stop the car.

619
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,620
Now, that place is loaded.

620
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:09,725
They are ripe for the picking.

621
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:13,758
And you are just the guy
for the job.

622
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,547
But seriously, doesn't this remind
you of that movie Heat...

623
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:18,623
- ... with Val Kilmer--?
- I'm trying my best.

624
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:22,088
There's nothing to be ashamed of,
is all I'm saying. Some people....

625
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:25,958
Some people have that robbing thing
and-- And some people don't.

626
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,528
Maybe...

627
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:29,663
...you're not a badass.

628
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,207
Hey, man. What can I do you for?

629
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:36,233
You can do me for
all the money in the till.

630
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:39,012
- This is a stickup.
- Whoa, what's wrong with you, dude?

631
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:41,033
I'm married,
that's what's wrong with me.

632
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:46,473
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

633
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:49,416
Move it, parquet! Come on, Zigzag.

634
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,129
That's a real gun.
You're robbing me.

635
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,982
- Dick?
- Honey, robe.

636
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,154
Oh, God, okay.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

637
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:00,869
Listen to me. What are you
doing, are you craz--?

638
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:02,977
- What?
- Listen, put your hands down.

639
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,418
- He's been stressed.
- Why are you undercutting me?

640
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,751
- To be fair, we both--
- I'm trying to rob this man.

641
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:10,983
- We don't need to do this.
- I got a call about the mortgage.

642
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:15,110
If we don't pay tomorrow, the sheriff's
coming to put us out on the street.

643
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:18,859
Get the money out of
there right now, I mean it!

644
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,639
- Pull it out, put it in a sack! Let's go!
- Easy, hon.

645
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:24,194
- God! Oh, God!
- Come on.

646
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:28,329
Wow, that's fantastic.
Women are amazing, aren't they?

647
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:29,803
It's just like jelly jars.

648
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,650
Whoa, hon.! Hon!

649
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:35,271
- Look, look.
- Hon?

650
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,221
- What?
- I don't think anybody's following us.

651
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:39,844
God!

652
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,507
Oh, look out for that.

653
00:49:50,383 --> 00:49:52,271
Oh, park under there.

654
00:50:02,288 --> 00:50:03,915
Oh, my God.

655
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:07,562
- I can't believe we just did that.
- But we did do it.

656
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:09,670
We did do it.

657
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:23,858
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

658
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:26,095
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

659
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,976
Exactly. And you know, maybe
we can figure out a way we can...

660
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,441
...give back some of what
we've taken to other people.

661
00:50:31,603 --> 00:50:33,839
Maybe we will.
It's a definite possibility.

662
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:35,411
Want to grab a cup of coffee?

663
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:38,058
- Iced mocha sounds nice.
- Yeah.

664
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:42,761
All right, this is a holdup. Get on
the ground and you won't get hurt.

665
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,492
Whoa, Jesus. Are you okay, hon.?

666
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,838
- I'm okay.
- All right.

667
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,273
You. Two iced mochas, let's go.
Move it, move it.

668
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:50,127
- Two iced mochas.
- Yeah. Whipped cream.

669
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,365
- Whipped cream.
- Any whipped cream, hon., on yours?

670
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:53,710
- No, thanks.
- None on hers.

671
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:56,747
- No whipped cream.
- Are these non-fat muffins?

672
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:58,673
- Are they non-fat muffins? !
- I think so.

673
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:01,555
Okay. Hon, these are non-fat
muffins. Get some of those.

674
00:51:01,718 --> 00:51:04,368
- Which ones, vanilla or chocolate?
- In the back, in the back.

675
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:05,711
- This one?
- No, no, that one.

676
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:07,471
- Front? Honey!
- No, that one. Okay.

677
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:10,191
Yeah, okay, that's good.
Okay, nobody try to follow us...

678
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,780
...because we're desperate criminals.
We're crazy people!

679
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,155
And I'll kill you all!

680
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:18,002
- Oh, hon., the coffee. Coffee.
- Oh, yeah, right.

681
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,886
Thanks a lot.

682
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,963
What are you doing in there?

683
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,720
What do you think?

684
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:33,170
- It's Elvis on a motorcycle?
- It's Evil Knievel, hon.

685
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:35,409
I like the way it makes my butt look.

686
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:16,948
Honey, where's my car?

687
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:29,819
Mercedes, off.

688
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:41,019
Now I can watch soccer!

689
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:44,531
No matter what happens,
know that I love you.

690
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:46,393
I love you too.

691
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:48,216
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

692
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,197
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

693
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,113
Oh, my God.

694
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,997
This guy's really loaded.

695
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:12,084
That's a lot of lettuce.

696
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,801
Should we pistol-whip him?

697
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:23,319
Hey, don't laugh.

698
00:53:23,488 --> 00:53:24,950
Don't you laugh now, okay?

699
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:27,449
Because it demeans
what we're doing here.

700
00:53:27,617 --> 00:53:29,178
Yeah.

701
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,134
- Anyway, shall we?
- Let's do it.

702
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:36,891
- What--? What is that?
- Nothing.

703
00:53:37,954 --> 00:53:39,678
Don't do anything funny, or else.

704
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,039
You could pay the ultimate price.

705
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:13,663
Honey, come on, cut the crap.

706
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,314
Okay.

707
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,213
We sound so funny.

708
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:25,057
I know. That's what I was thinking.

709
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:27,519
Oh, my God.

710
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:30,493
Hel--

711
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:46,397
Did you guys hear what happened
to Bob Bluestein?

712
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:48,193
- Bob Bluestein?
- Yeah.

713
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,295
- Who's Bob Bluestein?
- Oh, he works at Sonent Global.

714
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,951
Or should I say he worked
at Sonent Global.

715
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,542
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and if they're not careful...

716
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,468
...they'll become
the next Pyramid Tech.

717
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,022
Absolutely. Absolutely.

718
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:02,720
Oh, Dick...

719
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:04,994
...what you been up to since
Globodyne went under?

720
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:07,943
Just working at home,
playing in the stock market.

721
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,829
I tell you, guys...

722
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:13,540
- ... it's like stealing money.
- You're on fire, Dick.

723
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:22,401
- Last job, try to stay focused.
- Okay.

724
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,954
- Let me hold that door for you, ma'am.
- Why, thank you.

725
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,649
You're welcome.

726
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:31,624
Oh, my goodness.
This woman has fainted.

727
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:34,474
- Are you all right?
- You might want to open her blouse...

728
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:35,813
...so she can...

729
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:37,354
- ... breathe.
- Right.

730
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:40,232
- Oh, no, no, no, no, l--
- You okay?

731
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:45,963
Oh, no.

732
00:55:47,404 --> 00:55:48,387
That's good.

733
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:51,107
- Let me get back to you. Excuse me.
- Yes?

734
00:55:51,436 --> 00:55:53,509
- May I help you?
- Vault inspector.

735
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:58,247
- What happened to Phil?
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

736
00:55:58,413 --> 00:56:00,355
Caused by
an invasive streptococcus.

737
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:02,347
What?

738
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,167
Flesh-eating disorder.

739
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,276
It's all over the money.

740
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,714
Might want to wash your hands.

741
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:22,955
- Everybody down!
- This is a robbery!

742
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:26,218
- No way!
- Freeze, everybody.

743
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,829
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

744
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,422
- Oh, no.
- Nobody move a muscle.

745
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,146
You. Whiskers, whiskers.
On the floor.

746
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,720
Oh, Dick.

747
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:42,473
I will blow those whiskers...

748
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,168
- ... right off your face!
- I'm down!

749
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:46,988
- Go get the money, please.
- You're-- You're money, I'm guns...

750
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,772
- ... that's the plan.
- Put your weapons down.

751
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:51,977
- Oh, shit.
- Stick to the plan, stick to the plan.

752
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:55,594
- I'm putting the weapon down.
- Bring it on, pigs!

753
00:56:55,762 --> 00:56:57,616
- Honey.
- What are you doing?

754
00:56:57,778 --> 00:57:00,168
Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick.
Run, Dick, run.

755
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:02,346
- You coward!
- Stay on the ground.

756
00:57:02,514 --> 00:57:04,937
- Whoa, boy.
- You quitter!

757
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:08,075
- I'm cuffed! I'm cuffed!
- You filthy pig.

758
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:09,803
- I'm sorry.
- Bring it on.

759
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:12,338
- Bring it on, I'll take on all of you!
- Oz?

760
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:15,597
- Hon, get the car! Get the car!
- Debbie.

761
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,483
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, Dick.

762
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,237
Honey.

763
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:24,688
Oh, thank God.

764
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:26,132
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

765
00:57:26,132 --> 00:57:27,059
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

766
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,196
... former employees
of now-defunct Globodyne...

767
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:31,274
... were charged
with armed robbery...

768
00:57:31,444 --> 00:57:35,918
- ... after holding up a local branch...
- Dick. Dick, that could have been us.

769
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,361
What were we thinking?

770
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:41,300
- and turned to crime as a result
of their sudden unemployment,

771
00:57:41,942 --> 00:57:45,008
Like this woman, Naomi Seiler,
a human-resources manager...

772
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:48,208
... caught last May managing
a different kind of resource:

773
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:51,920
220 kilos of Canada 's
finest marijuana,

774
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:56,076
I knew her. She always remembered
everybody's birthday.

775
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:59,825
Or this man, Mark Fish,
a former VP of Globodyne, , ,

776
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:02,446
... who was arrested after using
his home as the setting...

777
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:04,502
... for secret high-stakes cockfights,

778
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:08,078
Mark Fish? He was such a nice guy.

779
00:58:08,247 --> 00:58:10,004
Globodyne CFO
Frank Bascombe...

780
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:13,168
...starts serving his 18-month
prison term next week,

781
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:16,151
- Eighteen months? That's nothing.
- Bastard.

782
00:58:16,312 --> 00:58:18,352
- -trying to incriminate
Jack McAllister,

783
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:21,555
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't think I got away with anything,

784
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:24,623
The collapse of Globodyne
hurt me financially and personally...

785
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:28,590
... just like any other employee,
I'm sick about it,

786
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,375
I'm et up about it,

787
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:35,188
Now watch this shot,

788
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:40,500
Did I get him?

789
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:42,484
- Now you did,
- Great,

790
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,025
Look at that guy.

791
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,733
Everybody's in hell,
he's on vacation shooting stuff.

792
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,247
Man, I hope every one of these
bastards get what they deserve.

793
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:53,329
Prosecutors say next
to be indicted will be...

794
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:55,539
... company spin doctor Dick Harper,

795
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:58,266
- Harper gave misleading statements...
- What? Indicted?

796
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:01,111
... about Globodyne's finances
one minute before the company...

797
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,481
- Indicted?
- That's not fair. They made you...

798
00:59:03,645 --> 00:59:05,368
...go on that show.

799
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:07,703
You hear what they said?
I'm going to be indicted.

800
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:10,202
- But you only said what they told you.
- Indicted, Jane!

801
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:12,886
Indicted. I'm going to be indicted.

802
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:14,547
- Wait, it's going to be--
- Indicted!

803
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,473
- Honey-- Dick--
- Indicted!

804
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,816
- Honey--
- Gonne be indicted!

805
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:20,829
Hold it, they can't--
It's going to be okay. Just calm down.

806
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:24,666
I can't calm down,
I'm going to be indicted. Indicted!

807
00:59:25,374 --> 00:59:27,611
I'm going to be indicted!

808
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:30,004
Indicted!

809
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:33,533
I'm going to be indicted!

810
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,549
Be indicted!

811
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:46,972
You know, I haven't seen you
in the downtown club for a while, sir.

812
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:51,740
Well, that's because
I was very, very busy...

813
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:54,206
...being indicted.

814
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:11,776
Look at all the executives.

815
01:00:13,537 --> 01:00:17,978
You guys are my kind of peeps.

816
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:21,758
Captains of industry,
masters of the universe...

817
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:26,048
...presidents of Hair Club for Men.
That's a nice piece of hair.

818
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:28,862
You can't even see the tread marks.

819
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:33,018
This squirrel died of natural causes.

820
01:00:34,148 --> 01:00:36,766
Excuse me, pardon me.

821
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:43,811
I got to get to the "toppy tip"
of the financial summit.

822
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:45,979
Isn't anyone going to do anything?

823
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:49,378
This happens every week.
This guy actually isn't that bad.

824
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:55,164
I'm a corporate puppet.

825
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:58,529
And I'm going to need
some more string...

826
01:00:58,694 --> 01:01:01,858
...so I can go on believing
I'll be a real boy someday...

827
01:01:02,022 --> 01:01:04,608
- ... without being manipulated...
- No, no, no, I got it.

828
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:06,530
...by the bullshit!

829
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:08,932
Oh, my God, Dick.
Come down from there.

830
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:17,116
Hon, I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting.

831
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:20,670
Sweetie, you're standing on a table
pretending to be a puppet.

832
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:22,563
Who's pretending?

833
01:01:25,288 --> 01:01:28,256
- Couldn't you have just cut him off?
- He only had half a beer.

834
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:38,525
Dick, hi. Long time no see.

835
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:45,032
- Frank! Frank!
- I'm going to get him. Just--

836
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:50,594
Frank, where are you going?

837
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:54,369
- Dick!
- Come on, Frank.

838
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:58,018
I just want to have a talk.

839
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:00,329
Hey there, Frankie.

840
01:02:00,491 --> 01:02:03,720
How do you like those
eggs Florentine?

841
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:06,884
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, it was Jack.

842
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:08,327
It was Jack.

843
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,045
He siphoned off
all of Globodyne's assets...

844
01:02:11,212 --> 01:02:14,474
...and then he dumped the stock.
It was his plan from the beginning.

845
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,577
Son of a bitch!

846
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:18,338
That fucker!

847
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:21,443
- Hon, language.
- She's right.

848
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:22,986
When you get out of prison...

849
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:25,253
...you'll get $20 million
to keep your mouth shut.

850
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:28,202
No, 1 0. You think
I could have gotten 20?

851
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:30,083
You son of a b--

852
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:32,392
- You'll break-- Dick.
- I want him.

853
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:35,175
- Let go.
- Don't you think I feel terrible?

854
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,545
Why do you think I'm drinking
myself to death?

855
01:02:37,709 --> 01:02:41,004
Instead of drinking, why don't
you do something about it.

856
01:02:41,165 --> 01:02:44,745
Yeah, Frank. Sometimes the cure
is a clean conscience.

857
01:02:46,382 --> 01:02:49,678
- That is good.
- Thanks, hon.

858
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,660
- I just thought of it.
- You did?

859
01:02:51,822 --> 01:02:53,645
- Yeah.
- You're right.

860
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:55,716
You're right. Help me up.
Help me up.

861
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:58,855
Yeah, help me up.
I got to think of something.

862
01:02:59,216 --> 01:03:01,255
Okay, just give me a minute.
Just give me--

863
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:03,246
Hey.

864
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:05,000
Hey!

865
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:12,525
- Not this time, Frank.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

866
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:16,583
It's force of habit.
I know a way. I know a way.

867
01:03:17,905 --> 01:03:21,451
But it's really, really risky.

868
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:23,914
That's where Jack keeps it.

869
01:03:24,081 --> 01:03:27,181
Four hundred million in
highly liquid U.S. bearer bonds.

870
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,924
So it's a vault job. Go in after
midnight, bypass security...

871
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,065
...and... power tools.

872
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:35,339
- It's a little simpler than that.
- Power tools?

873
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:40,111
Jack's going to have to take those
bonds out of the safe-deposit box,

874
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,616
That should be fun for him,

875
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:42,988
Here's my babies.

876
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:45,576
So, what's he going to do
with the money?

877
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,079
There it is,
the Grand Cayman Bank.

878
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,803
Grand Cayman. What is this place?

879
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:52,044
It's where rich people
go to evade taxes,

880
01:03:52,212 --> 01:03:53,618
- Bastards,
- Honey,

881
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:56,049
They can't hear us, What's next?

882
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,704
McAllister takes the bonds
to a representative...

883
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,935
... who asks him for his signature
to verify what they call "membership, "

884
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,889
Once the bonds are counted
and confirmed...

885
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:06,900
... McAllister will receive
a CRM-114 deposit form...

886
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,395
... and on this form
he inputs his account number...

887
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:12,492
... that only he and the bank know,
Then the agent will take this...

888
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:15,050
...to an authorization officer
for further verification.

889
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:18,091
Once the representative has stamped
and initialled the document...

890
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,596
... the account rep will take
the CRM- 1 14...

891
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:24,304
... back to McAllister for final
approval before finalization,

892
01:04:24,471 --> 01:04:26,226
You said this was
going to be simple.

893
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,070
Can you explain it again?
Jane doesn't seem to understand.

894
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:32,500
- Jane, it's simple. It's so simple.
- Jeez.

895
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,189
Now, listen.

896
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:36,431
All we have to do...

897
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:41,617
... is switch McAllister's CRM-114
with his account number...

898
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,191
... with one of our own,

899
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:45,174
- I'm so sorry.
- A copy that we have made...

900
01:04:45,336 --> 01:04:49,777
...that has a number from an account
that I have established.

901
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:54,036
And Jack sends the 400 million
to us without knowing it.

902
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:56,022
That's-- You got it. It's so simple.

903
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,225
That is beautiful. It's a switch.

904
01:04:58,393 --> 01:04:59,821
- It's a switch,
- It's a switch,

905
01:04:59,993 --> 01:05:01,520
- It's a switch.
- That's so sexy, man.

906
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,788
- That's unbelievable. It'll be fun.
- But Jane's going to have to do it.

907
01:05:04,953 --> 01:05:08,663
Because if McAllister sees either
one of us, he'll know something's up.

908
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:11,826
- And l... ?
- Do nothing.

909
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:15,280
I can do that.

910
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,941
Yeah.

911
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:19,415
Okay.

912
01:05:19,578 --> 01:05:21,881
- You do it, then. You're the one.
- Yeah.

913
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,449
Yeah.

914
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:27,416
- You could do it, except--
- No, it's good.

915
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,434
No, you do it. You do it. You do it.

916
01:05:29,595 --> 01:05:31,418
- You deserve to do it.
- Honey--

917
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,867
Are you ready to make the switch?
Do you have the form?

918
01:05:40,028 --> 01:05:42,549
- It's right here.
- We should practice the move.

919
01:05:42,716 --> 01:05:44,025
- No, I got it.
- Okay, fine.

920
01:05:44,188 --> 01:05:46,393
I won't be involved.
I won't participate at all.

921
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:48,946
- You do it. It's all you.
- Let's do one for good luck.

922
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:51,419
I got dressed up.
You're not doing me any favours.

923
01:05:51,582 --> 01:05:53,916
- Get out of the car!
- I just think it's important.

924
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:55,638
That's all.

925
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,740
Okay, I'll be the bank representative.
And you be you.

926
01:06:02,174 --> 01:06:04,378
Hey. Hey! Wait, sir.

927
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:07,030
- No! No, no. No!
- Sorry.

928
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,981
- Everybody ready?
- No.

929
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:17,757
- What?
- Well, Dick lost the form.

930
01:06:17,919 --> 01:06:19,643
- So....
- What?

931
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,262
Do you have an extra copy?

932
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:24,734
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that? !

933
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:26,903
Oh, let me guess, a fifth of Scotch!

934
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,054
You son of a--

935
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:31,158
Wait. Stop it. Knock it off!

936
01:06:31,328 --> 01:06:33,500
My God. Wait a second.
Can we get another one?

937
01:06:33,665 --> 01:06:35,192
Is that possible?
How can we do that?

938
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,149
You know what,
I'm going to take the car...

939
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:39,070
...and I'm going to try
to delay McAllister.

940
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:41,306
- He's here. He's here.
- Oh, God.

941
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:45,338
- What are you--?
- I'm going.

942
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:55,421
That was not cool.

943
01:06:57,538 --> 01:06:59,425
Okay. It's very simple. I got it.

944
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:01,048
- I got it. It's very simple.
- What?

945
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:04,513
Go into the bank. Go into the office
of the client-relations coordinator.

946
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:08,221
The document forms are backed up
on her disk, you have to print one out.

947
01:07:08,388 --> 01:07:12,611
- Who's this guy? Do I say hello?
- Never mind. Just blow past them.

948
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:22,147
Quaint.

949
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,599
McAllister, 1 2 o'clock.

950
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:28,864
Okay, I'm going to go.
I'm going to go stall him.

951
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:31,162
- Hon.
- What?

952
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,951
How am I supposed to find
the client-relations coordinator?

953
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,092
Turn around.

954
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:57,021
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jack McAllister.

955
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:03,169
- I'm sorry?
- It's me, Deb Fester booth.

956
01:08:13,832 --> 01:08:15,741
- Hi.
- Hi.

957
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:19,935
Oh, is that the legendary
espresso machine?

958
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:21,570
You want some?

959
01:08:21,737 --> 01:08:23,232
- Really, could l?
- Sure, yeah.

960
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:25,158
- Good to see you.
- From the fundraiser.

961
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:28,966
I am truly sorry,
but I really don't recall you, Miss... ?

962
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:32,359
Fester brook-- Booth. Yes.
No, listen, this is crazy.

963
01:08:32,522 --> 01:08:34,279
You have to remember.

964
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,628
- And here you go.
- Thank you.

965
01:08:42,795 --> 01:08:44,388
Oh, excuse me. That's my phone.

966
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:46,213
Oh, me too.

967
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,735
Grand Cayman Bank,
how may I help you?

968
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:51,979
Karen Williams, please.

969
01:08:54,188 --> 01:08:56,610
- This is Karen.
- Yes, Mrs. Williams...

970
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:00,325
...this is Officer Red green...

971
01:09:00,492 --> 01:09:02,981
...of the MVPDL.

972
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:06,497
And we've recovered a stolen vehicle
that is registered in your name.

973
01:09:06,669 --> 01:09:09,157
We'd appreciate it if you could
come to the impound lot--

974
01:09:09,324 --> 01:09:11,430
What? My car's been stolen?

975
01:09:11,757 --> 01:09:15,849
Don't you remember my tattoo
of a green monkey on my ass?

976
01:09:16,014 --> 01:09:18,118
Someone stole my car
right out of the parking lot.

977
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:19,780
No way.

978
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,791
- Yeah.
- It's Dick.

979
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:32,070
I got it.

980
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,268
- Dick.
- Yeah.

981
01:09:35,599 --> 01:09:38,982
Is the client-relations coordinator
a blond woman with a red scarf?

982
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:42,447
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She noticed her car isn't stolen.

983
01:09:42,608 --> 01:09:46,187
- What's the account number?
- P-N-5-9-7...

984
01:09:46,352 --> 01:09:48,294
P-N-5-9-7...

985
01:09:49,136 --> 01:09:51,885
- ...2-K-4-0.
- 2-4-K--

986
01:09:52,048 --> 01:09:54,383
No, 2-K-4-0.

987
01:09:58,545 --> 01:10:00,815
- Oh, my God.
- Got it.

988
01:10:01,617 --> 01:10:04,170
Oh, my God, my car!

989
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:06,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

990
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,361
- I didn't see you there.
- What is wrong with you?

991
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:09,938
What's wrong with me?

992
01:10:10,099 --> 01:10:12,138
You're parked
in a handicapped space.

993
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:15,056
- That's not a handicapped space.
- It is now!

994
01:10:15,505 --> 01:10:17,262
Yes!

995
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,342
- What are you doing here?
- It's too late.

996
01:10:43,509 --> 01:10:46,159
The account rep's authorizing
the CRM-1 1 4 right now.

997
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,536
Oh, man!

998
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:54,826
Wait a second.
He's not going back into the room.

999
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:57,811
- Where is he going?
- I'm going to go down...

1000
01:10:57,974 --> 01:11:01,138
...and get this stamped and initialled.
You stall him.

1001
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:03,381
Oh, I hate stalling!

1002
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:06,958
- Catches my dust.
- Traffic congestion.

1003
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:13,516
Hey, Spence, good to see
you again. How you been?

1004
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:17,076
Well, thank you.

1005
01:11:17,591 --> 01:11:19,020
Will you excuse me for a moment?

1006
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,046
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1007
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:24,503
Say, Dick, I'm probably
going to be arrested for DWI...

1008
01:11:24,664 --> 01:11:27,054
...so I won't be there
when you get out.

1009
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,970
- Can we talk about this later?
- Look what I found in his car.

1010
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:34,513
I don't wish to discuss this in front
of the branch employees, that's why.

1011
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:38,869
Nobody likes to be the bad guy, Bill.
But here I am, chopping heads.

1012
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,631
- I already verified--
- I understand the need for layoffs.

1013
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:49,012
I'm concerned about morale.

1014
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:51,545
I'm fine, really. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

1015
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:54,937
- Madam, can I have my form back?
- What did you just call me?

1016
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:57,270
I just don't want to start
a bloodbath.

1017
01:11:57,434 --> 01:12:00,020
- Can I have my form back?
- Your "form"?

1018
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:04,311
- Is that how you spell your name?
- Why don't I just do this for you, sir.

1019
01:12:04,475 --> 01:12:06,515
My form.

1020
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,623
You know, there is
one bright light here.

1021
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,308
Spencer, the guy with the
stampy thing, he's top-drawer.

1022
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:14,331
Thank you, sir.

1023
01:12:15,067 --> 01:12:16,562
Dick?

1024
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:17,976
Dick Harper?

1025
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,580
Jack McAllister.

1026
01:12:24,828 --> 01:12:28,145
- You just struck me.
- Look what the cat coughed up.

1027
01:12:28,317 --> 01:12:31,514
My gosh, you cut an impressive
swath, I'll tell you that.

1028
01:12:31,678 --> 01:12:34,547
- And you smell good too, you devil.
- Just hold on a second.

1029
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,725
What do you say
we put all this behind us.

1030
01:12:36,893 --> 01:12:40,309
- Dick, what are you doing here?
- You know, working, mostly, here...

1031
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:42,387
...temporarily, over in Transfers.

1032
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,696
- Okay? Just drop it.
- I heard you left town.

1033
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:49,532
Yeah, I was in Mexico for a while. But
mostly I've been working in Transfers.

1034
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:51,768
- Oh, I see.
- Poppy cocker.

1035
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:54,074
I wanted to tell you that
you are my inspiration.

1036
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,574
- There's no hard feelings?
- You did the best you could.

1037
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:59,256
- That's all anybody could ask for.
- Decent of you to say.

1038
01:12:59,424 --> 01:13:00,951
Like my granddaddy
used to tell me--

1039
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,495
Bye.

1040
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:04,572
It was so great. We did it!

1041
01:13:04,735 --> 01:13:07,834
Mr. McAllister, please.

1042
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,616
I don't know.
I think I made a mistake.

1043
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:13,686
- Are you kidding? You were great!
- No, no, no.

1044
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:15,159
Here we are, sir.

1045
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,184
Days like this,
they make my hands shake.

1046
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:18,938
- Know what I'm saying?
- I can imagine.

1047
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:21,758
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. What is he doing?

1048
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,855
We got one situation here,
now, fells...

1049
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,229
...which is that that number wrong.

1050
01:13:27,393 --> 01:13:28,735
That's incorrect right there.

1051
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,018
- Did he see us?
- I have no idea.

1052
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:34,877
I think he saw you.

1053
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,200
I think he saw you.

1054
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,160
You were sticking your big head
out there.

1055
01:13:40,323 --> 01:13:43,487
I got to hit the road here, fells,
so I'm going to sign this for you...

1056
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:45,375
- ... then you going to change it.
- Yes.

1057
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,387
Oh, man. You know,
this is really not the time.

1058
01:13:48,547 --> 01:13:51,198
This is really not the time.
Oh, God, he's coming.

1059
01:13:51,364 --> 01:13:53,568
- He's coming, hon.
- Okay.

1060
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,282
Jack, hey. It was great seeing you.

1061
01:13:57,764 --> 01:14:00,415
- Where's Frank Bascombe?
- Come again?

1062
01:14:01,092 --> 01:14:03,035
You didn't think I'd catch that,
now, did you?

1063
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,212
- What do you mean?
- Here's what you're going to do.

1064
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:08,643
You're going to turn around
and march out of here now.

1065
01:14:08,805 --> 01:14:10,659
You're going to take Goldilocks
there with you.

1066
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:15,012
And I won't put the two of you
in prison for a very long time.

1067
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,724
Actually, honey, I think that sounds
pretty good. I think....

1068
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:21,406
I think we should take it,
you know.

1069
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,391
You think so, hon.?

1070
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,736
I do.

1071
01:14:28,743 --> 01:14:31,077
- Because I don't.
- Dick Harper.

1072
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:35,228
I've been terminated, bankrupted,
deported and blackmailed...

1073
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:36,926
...because of you.

1074
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:40,260
And I'm not leaving here
without your money.

1075
01:14:43,048 --> 01:14:47,621
What you going to do, Dick?
Shoot me if I don't approve that form?

1076
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,040
Write me a check.

1077
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:57,766
- You are kidding me.
- Dick, it's not going to do us any good.

1078
01:14:57,928 --> 01:15:00,744
He's just going to cancel it
the minute we walk out of here.

1079
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:02,727
I don't care.

1080
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:04,613
I don't care.

1081
01:15:04,778 --> 01:15:07,680
I'm not walking out of this bank
empty-handed.

1082
01:15:11,915 --> 01:15:15,046
All right. All right, Dick,
I'm going to write you a check.

1083
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:18,309
- I'm going to need my hand back.
- Gladly.

1084
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:23,135
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm going to write you that check.

1085
01:15:23,307 --> 01:15:25,479
And what's more,
I'm not going to cancel it.

1086
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:27,651
Because I think it takes
a lot of cojones...

1087
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:31,365
...to do what you two have done
here today. And I admire that.

1088
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:32,938
So...

1089
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:36,070
...here you go.

1090
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,756
Just a little something to show you
what I think you're worth.

1091
01:15:47,597 --> 01:15:49,702
Y'all take care, now.

1092
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:56,967
Dick, honey...

1093
01:15:57,966 --> 01:16:00,584
...give me the squirt gun, okay?

1094
01:16:05,423 --> 01:16:07,562
Do you still have
McAllister's form?

1095
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:09,672
Why?

1096
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:15,053
Because I just got his signature.

1097
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,864
Weren't you an art major?

1098
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,760
Dick Harper! I had no idea
what you were doing.

1099
01:16:26,928 --> 01:16:30,344
I was completely fooled.
My God, I didn't know you could act.

1100
01:16:30,512 --> 01:16:33,361
Hon, in 1 0th grade I played Biff
in Death of a Salesman.

1101
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:35,048
- Come on.
- That's just--

1102
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:37,901
See the way I got
my eyes watering up?

1103
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:41,678
Yes, sir. It's all right there.

1104
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,656
I am married to a genius.

1105
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:46,280
It's a turn-on, isn't it?

1106
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,167
- You're a criminal.
- I'm a hardened criminal.

1107
01:16:50,195 --> 01:16:54,505
Hon, first we need
to talk to Spencer.

1108
01:16:55,283 --> 01:16:57,007
Right.

1109
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:07,016
Are you in the habit of signing things
without looking at them?

1110
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:12,883
Miss Sheinkopf?

1111
01:17:14,549 --> 01:17:17,614
Miss Sheinkopf,
I'm going to be home by 6.

1112
01:17:31,349 --> 01:17:33,805
- Mr. McAllister!
- Jack!

1113
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:36,912
- Mr. McAllister!
- Mr. McAllister!

1114
01:17:37,078 --> 01:17:40,112
We're all waiting for you over here,
Jack. Everybody's really pumped.

1115
01:17:40,278 --> 01:17:41,871
Come on!

1116
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:43,949
Is this some kind of a joke, Dick?

1117
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,841
Are you still trying
to get even with me?

1118
01:17:46,006 --> 01:17:47,916
Why would I get even
with such a generous man?

1119
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:50,989
I still can't believe you did that.
Jane and I were way off base.

1120
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:54,542
- He's on in 20, right? Hook him up.
- Wait, on what?

1121
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:55,922
Sam Samuels. Money Life.

1122
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,569
Oh, and here are some
suggested responses.

1123
01:18:03,257 --> 01:18:04,947
Live to Southern California,
where...

1124
01:18:05,112 --> 01:18:08,080
... in a stunning act of personal
generosity, Jack McAllister...

1125
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:10,637
Who the hell do you think you are?

1126
01:18:10,808 --> 01:18:12,664
I'm your
VP of Communications, Jack.

1127
01:18:12,825 --> 01:18:15,607
- -personally funded the defunct
corporation's pension fund,

1128
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:18,297
You said I just did what?

1129
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:21,392
God, I love this guy,

1130
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:26,646
But seriously, Jack,
what made you do it?

1131
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:31,546
Well, l-- Sam, l....

1132
01:18:43,163 --> 01:18:46,874
I realized, Sam, that since
the employees of Globodyne...

1133
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:51,095
...had given me so much, it was time
for me to give back to them.

1134
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:55,516
So yesterday, I wire-transferred...

1135
01:18:55,676 --> 01:18:57,464
...$400 million...

1136
01:18:58,237 --> 01:19:01,139
...into the newly created
Globodyne Pension Relief Fund.

1137
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,926
Oh, yeah!

1138
01:19:09,085 --> 01:19:11,987
Let's look at what happened when
the first ex-Globodyne employees...

1139
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:14,012
... received their shares of money,

1140
01:19:14,174 --> 01:19:17,370
Many people had their life savings
invested in the company...

1141
01:19:17,534 --> 01:19:20,382
...and were delighted to learn
their pensions had been returned,

1142
01:19:20,542 --> 01:19:22,876
It is the first time
in U, S, corporate history...

1143
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,716
... that a CEO has personally funded
a bankrupted pension plan,

1144
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:29,694
This incredible gesture won't soon
be forgotten by the people...

1145
01:19:29,855 --> 01:19:32,244
... whose lives it has
so dramatically affected,

1146
01:19:32,415 --> 01:19:33,757
And this is just the beginning,

1147
01:19:33,919 --> 01:19:36,701
In the coming months, thousands
more will be receiving a check...

1148
01:19:36,863 --> 01:19:40,246
... for the full value of their
lost pensions and life savings,

1149
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:44,251
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1150
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:46,685
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1151
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:48,922
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1152
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,161
You hear that? They love you, Jack.

1153
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,118
- Now, go to hell.
- Mr. McAllister...

1154
01:19:53,281 --> 01:19:55,484
...do you consider yourself
a modern-day Robin Hood?

1155
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:58,497
- Does this mean you're off the hook?
- Do you want to save the whales?

1156
01:20:02,338 --> 01:20:03,996
Now, hang on a minute.

1157
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,773
Have you decided to contribute
to the homeless?

1158
01:20:07,938 --> 01:20:09,825
What made you so gracious?

1159
01:20:11,074 --> 01:20:13,213
Mr. McAllister,
how do you feel right now?

1160
01:20:13,379 --> 01:20:16,096
Mr. McAllister, how about giving
a brother a buck?

1161
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:21,532
Look at our beautiful family.

1162
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:28,347
My name is Dick Harper.

1163
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:38,649
- I agree.
- Hey, Harpers, stick them up!
