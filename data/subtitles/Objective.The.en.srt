1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,920
My name is Benjamin Keynes.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,799
I work for the department operations,
of the CIA.

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,200
Three days after 9 / 11,

4
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:25,455
picks up satellites
a radioactive signal,

5
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:28,259
in a remote part of Afghanistan.

6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:33,227
The CIA feared that Al Qaeda
a nuclear weapon is secured.

7
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,637
I got information
of a reliable local source,

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,328
that perhaps something much more powerful.

9
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,061
It is more than a decade ago,
I have since departed.

10
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,885
I forgot how bad it could be.

11
00:01:09,747 --> 00:01:13,486
I have the feeling that every time,
as we enter this country, we want uitspugen.

12
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:22,553
Almost everyone here has too busy
with the search for a war,

13
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,196
making them no attention to me.
And that's a good thing.

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,900
Sir, agent Keynes.

15
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,228
I finally met
the commander and team leader,

16
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,771
Sergeant Wallis Hamer.

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,424
I gave them the official story,
as if I voorlas from the memos in Langley.

18
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:48,220
Major Keynes, it is perhaps your party,
but they are men, okay?

19
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:50,889
Sure.

20
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:54,629
They thought that I lied.

21
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:11,459
My first assignment was contacted,
with my local source, Mohammed Aban.

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,557
He asked me to come, so I hope
that he is there, if we are to knock him.

23
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,455
Sir, the men are ready for you

24
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:30,453
Major Keynes,
let me suggest one of the men.

25
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,708
This is my teamoudste, Tanner,
Information officer also.

26
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,761
He gets us back within a day.

27
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,747
Our doctor, sergeant Degetau.
-- How does it.

28
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:48,654
Explosives, Trinoski sergeant.
That there on the floor is sergeant Cole.

29
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:54,541
And last but not least, sergeant Sadler,
weapons and Afghanistan expert.

30
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,185
392 is a good team, you will find no better.

31
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,151
That is why I am here.

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,898
Gentlemen, thank you that you
at such short notice, wanted.

33
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:11,770
My orders are about the contact
with a certain Mohammed Aban.

34
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:14,668
A spiritual,
who lives in the southern provinces.

35
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:20,226
We want a recorded statement from him,
which he supports the U.S. mission here.

36
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:26,011
This is our man.

37
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,590
Look good.

38
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:32,785
Aban is highly respected
by the local population.

39
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:38,060
He is seen as the spiritual strength,
that the Mujahadin helped the Soviets to beat.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,620
I thought that the CIA, the spiritual
force, which helped the Soviets to beat.

41
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:50,977
That depends on your definition,
of mental sergeant.

42
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,032
Aban was in hiding for the Taliban,
so it is important that we make contact,

43
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,104
once we have visibility of his position.

44
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,931
When we arrived there, we make contact
and we disappear again.

45
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,809
Smiles to the population,
conquer hearts, no doors-stroke, okay?

46
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,603
The mission will start at 1400 hours.

47
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,513
0130 inspection.

48
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,846
0230 departure.
-- We go.

49
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:24,409
Remember, nothing is routine.

50
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:32,307
Special Forces team 392.
I had heard of them.

51
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:39,163
She worked in the Zagran.
Smart men, they can handle secrets.

52
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,801
Vigorous as necessary.

53
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,498
A nice camera.

54
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,392
I gave my wife a wedding on our,
they do not know how they 'm to use.

55
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:54,439
But because his hair
never late, Ski.

56
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:58,484
What a man gives his wife
Now a camera on her wedding day.

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,750
Very romantic, Ski.
-- They used 'm for the baby, if it comes.

58
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:10,901
I would not want to be your wife,
legs spread and the child while filming.

59
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,903
Her sister, the recordings,
but they also know yet how it works.

60
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:19,669
But I mean, do not be surprised
bruinverbrand as that baby is born.

61
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:26,465
Two minutes.

62
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,348
Okay, you ready for this.

63
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:13,198
When I stepped from the helicopter,
I got a sense of enlightenment.

64
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,720
The time for a reconsideration is over.

65
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:19,195
The goal is all that counts.

66
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,461
I have no other choice,
then the goal.

67
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,230
It looks pretty quiet out from here.
-- Dan, I am always the most concern.

68
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,723
We can better establish an observatory.

69
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:46,506
Yes, ga with Pete to that hill,
Please indicate if it is safe to go.

70
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:51,708
For the others. Keynes and I
are the begroetingscomite. We go first.

71
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:56,047
Keynes, are you ready?
-- Yes, let's go.

72
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,353
Keep your eyes open.
It can wemelen of the enemies.

73
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,941
Hello.

74
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,418
Let me talk with her.

75
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:33,534
Good morning, how are today.

76
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:39,915
We come in peace.
We'd like Mohammed Aban.

77
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:05,445
Mohammed Aban live here no more.
He lives in the holy mountains.

78
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:10,761
Only the village elders know where that is.

79
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:17,297
Sorry. We would be honoured
Mohammed Aban to speak.

80
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:26,112
If he would like to help us,
that is good for your tribe.

81
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,662
Follow me.

82
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,162
Thank you!

83
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:35,595
There is nothing changed,
since my last stay.

84
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,652
You can only to the color of
Uniforms, in which period you are.

85
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,315
Hello, we are looking Mohammed Aban.

86
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,530
Aban nam, a week before the orders came
to be here to be executed, contact.

87
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:10,110
He had little coherent
and I thought ie lost his mind.

88
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:13,190
That was, that we saw themselves.

89
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:25,352
My grandfather said that he departed,
because the Taliban had killed him otherwise.

90
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:31,595
The woman with whom we spoke told
that he was in the mountains, you know where?

91
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:40,159
This is sacred ground, the Taliban have not come,
that is forbidden by God, Allah.

92
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,383
I understand it.
-- What do you want, chocolate?

93
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,914
This is special, from New York.
What you will find here.

94
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,679
And this, you are smart, eh?

95
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,731
It seems,
as if we are back behind ghosts maximum capacity.

96
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:56,745
It is ghostly, eh?

97
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,093
Hey, did you cope with camera
good view?

98
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,500
No, what is there.
-- That you do not buy in a regular store.

99
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,741
Give me the radio.

100
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:15,748
Snake 76. Snake 76.
This beast is 92, left.

101
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:24,397
Hose 76, the packet is not here,
request to be met back on.

102
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:43,553
Can I use my camera?
I want the Americans to show

103
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,486
how the house
of a holy man looks like.

104
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:32,627
We found Aban's house,
but we had now found evidence?

105
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,225
I wonder,
what these people would do,

106
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,186
when they suddenly came to power,
to destroy a nation.

107
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:10,554
We can only hope,
that they have become tired of the fighting.

108
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:29,102
Eat please.

109
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:47,570
Why do you want to speak with our holy?

110
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:53,942
We want an explanation from him,
to liberate your country from the Taliban.

111
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:05,041
My grandfather says that nobody
Afghanistan freed of the Taliban,

112
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,018
that can only Allah.

113
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,440
I believe that Allah gave us in your area.

114
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:15,084
Most Americans
realize that just yet.

115
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,570
Do you know where those sacred mountains?

116
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:24,064
Yes, my father took me
a few years ago.

117
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:28,875
He showed where he wanted to be buried,
since it is now too late, he was kidnapped

118
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:32,974
by the Taliban, I fear that he is dead.

119
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:37,810
Is this holy place 'Dashtun'?

120
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,129
How do you know that?

121
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:45,873
I've lived here long ago.

122
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:53,515
I see the desert in your eyes.
-- What he said?

123
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:59,833
I think that he can help us.
-- You have until 0300, then we leave.

124
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,915
I must call.
-- Cole, the satelliettelefoon.

125
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,538
No, I have my own.
-- He has his own.

126
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,512
Just a damned James Bond.
-- You know James Bond?

127
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,862
Yes, I know him.
He dropped to his basic training.

128
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:26,278
I told HQ
I continued to phase two.

129
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,949
She said that the footprint faded.

130
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:33,649
So they called the hittespoor,
that was seen by the satellite.

131
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,572
Chief.

132
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,770
That was your death can be.
-- We should talk a change.

133
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:55,315
Let's important.

134
00:15:55,638 --> 00:16:00,688
The orders are, in order to go behind Aban
Now we have new information.

135
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,140
Information?
That nonsense that Obi-Wan told?

136
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:10,154
We suspected that Aban in the mountains Saturday.
We had the first time here.

137
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,588
We talk about two, up to three days,
for me to help this man to find.

138
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,854
Excuse me, but I ga even this check.

139
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:25,184
If he once knew,
we have no choice.

140
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,486
Man, d'r is no place to shit.

141
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,954
Hey, did you have chocolate?

142
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:43,235
I've already given you everything yesterday.
I have old cigars.

143
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:47,994
Hearts and minds, man.
-- What you want to step into.

144
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:50,286
Sorry boys.

145
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,340
What does he here?

146
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:57,925
He offered to be our guide.
-- We are full, you see that?

147
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,937
Someone who knows the environment,
ensures that we can be much faster.

148
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,660
That snap me,
but here the stikt of the enemies.

149
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,666
The time we win,
We lost because we need him.

150
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,339
Listen, I fought with my father,
I can adapt itself to me.

151
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:14,867
Well, do our part but rations with him.

152
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,444
We're going.

153
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:42,594
Abdul, ga not those Americans.
It is not safe for you.

154
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:47,593
It will go pretty well mother.
I earn a lot of money for the family.

155
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:53,318
I forbid you, your grandfather forbids it.
Stay at home, your father would not find.

156
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:56,908
I earn ten times as much on the market,
Please mother, I must go.

157
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,392
It is my mother but, row on.

158
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:03,755
I'm back soon. Beware grandfather.

159
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,729
Wherever we go, says the technique little.
50 dollars to a man from here,

160
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,424
let millions of dollars a duration
GPS system undertaken,

161
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,642
if you outages,
or your battery dies.

162
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:30,411
There was too much at stake.

163
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:40,375
Chief, I know we have our orders,
but we are quite vulnerable here.

164
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:45,005
I also think it is nothing,
but I am the boss now.

165
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,674
For us that you did.

166
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:02,982
Everything here seems to me the same.

167
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:06,490
At home, there is occasionally a pitch.

168
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,548
Cole where are you from?
-- Tampa, Florida, born and raised.

169
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:15,004
And you?
-- Chicago.

170
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:30,045
Stop.

171
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,827
What is he planning?
-- No idea.

172
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,547
We must continue.

173
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,777
What is the pe to do?

174
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,443
Why stop us on?

175
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,585
Therefore.
-- Potverdomme.

176
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:02,701
She said that this road was clean.
-- That was probably so ...

177
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,909
Look, you see that hole?

178
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:13,012
It looks like someone has dug.
-- That, I believe.

179
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:21,195
Good work Keynes.
You have saved us a bad day.

180
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,371
Let me guess,
we are going through that ravine.

181
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,559
Yes, that's right.

182
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:38,010
There are few places on earth,
as unforgivable as this desert.

183
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,863
Entire armies,
from those of Alexander to the Soviets,

184
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:44,472
The price paid
because they wanted to possess.

185
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,077
I hope that we are not so dumb.

186
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,334
That is wrong bunch.

187
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,709
It must be a trap.
-- Cole, back row.

188
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:43,026
Wait I look Ga.
-- No, do not.

189
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,264
Ski is concerned.

190
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,553
Let me take a look.
Chief, Ski severe bleeding.

191
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,034
Keep that for me, okay.

192
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,394
Chief, he was seriously injured.

193
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,999
Cole, come here to work there.

194
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:51,928
Reload, ga that direction,
and link those bastards.

195
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:53,844
Come.

196
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,441
Reload.

197
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,457
Walk through.

198
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:20,100
Pete, Keynes, deck them.
-- Okay.

199
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,815
Come.

200
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,355
I must try to close it.

201
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,218
Are you OK?

202
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:53,540
Check the RGP weft,
find out who that.

203
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,894
Is your friend's survival?

204
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,252
God has forgotten this place.

205
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:29,311
Are you sure that it was here?
-- Yes, the first here crept out the ditch.

206
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:32,847
Maybe you've only injured.
-- Certainly not.

207
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,591
I saw that they were hit.

208
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,452
That one was a hoofdschot,
the other in the chest.

209
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:40,936
I saw them neervallen.

210
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:44,609
Where are the bodies?
-- This is a good question.

211
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:48,491
Those guys do not know,
that they bring their dead.

212
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:52,244
I have you.

213
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:59,157
I have you.

214
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,190
Damn.

215
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,631
The heart was hit,
I could not stop the bleeding.

216
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:44,749
You did what you could,
we lay him in the truck, come.

217
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,025
The only dead in that battle,
There was one of us.

218
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,349
Incomprehensible.

219
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:19,659
As far as I know,
ghosts do not shoot with real bullets.

220
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:24,181
Hose 76, 76 snake.
This beast is 92.

221
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:32,099
I repeat,
92 beast requires to be picked up.

222
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,643
With a gesneuvelde on.

223
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:40,270
How does it look like?

224
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,153
Not good, the radiator is concerned.

225
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:48,623
Can you fix it?
-- Maybe the small holes, not that great.

226
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:50,883
This is also affected.

227
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:59,391
Okay, Abdul says that there is a roadblock.
That leads us to the mountain.

228
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,153
That is a half-day
to our next checkpunt.

229
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:08,059
Item? Maybe you have not heard.
But we'll let us pick up.

230
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:16,265
Listen, I'm sorry, Trinoski,
but stop the mission, is not an option.

231
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:19,478
We have more than enough resources,
to achieve our object

232
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,055
Resources?
-- Hey, Wally.

233
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,968
Let Ski not have died for nothing.

234
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,776
If we stop now,
Ski has died for nothing.

235
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:37,763
Cole, change the message in supplies.

236
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:44,107
Hose 76, hose 76, 92 beast on.

237
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,389
The morale is low, understandable

238
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:56,416
We must remain concentrated,
these men have been trained.

239
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:01,444
They would rather die than last
chosen for a mission.

240
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:08,335
Where's that damned heli?
-- No idea, he had already contacted state.

241
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,078
I hope that they are not shot,
on the other side of the valley,

242
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:19,892
where we ran in the fall.
-- That would kloten.

243
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,796
Wait, I hear him.

244
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,886
I hear nothing.

245
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:39,894
I have not imagined.

246
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,774
I see headlights.
At two hours.

247
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:54,751
It resembles a single vehicle.
And it is this side.

248
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,160
That's none of us,
who would no light at the time.

249
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,912
Hostile reinforcements presumably.
-- We must here.

250
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,907
Wait, they go out together.
-- What?

251
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,674
Did you do that.

252
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:14,389
What was that?

253
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:17,067
The Taliban have weapons.

254
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:21,610
Missiles maybe.
-- Whatever it was,

255
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:25,025
about an hour or two is the light,
We should work towards the other side of that mountain.

256
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:29,616
If we do, we find another
landingszone and ask where that bird is.

257
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,529
Come off.

258
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:38,576
They were down the lights, where Aban
it had when he contacted.

259
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,581
I knew now at least,
that we opgingen the right direction.

260
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:58,547
We had horses should take.
-- Since it is now too late.

261
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:06,003
Damn.
The engine is overheated.

262
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,489
These mountains make sure that he is ten times
to work harder than normal.

263
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,706
Stop here, he can cool down.

264
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,867
I open the bonnet,
he can ventilate.

265
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:34,335
How are we in time?

266
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:38,112
We must continue as we are opposed
the dark mountain like this.

267
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:43,557
Look, it's still a long way.
-- My kingdom for a few donkeys.

268
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:46,280
What has happened to him?

269
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:56,497
Have you seen anything?

270
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,800
We did not have to drive through the valley.

271
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,101
Our tracks are cleared.
-- What has happened to our reliable guide?

272
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,365
He's going to reisziek.

273
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:20,729
Chief, I do not have to deal with the satellite,
Mount creates interference.

274
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,133
I try after the pass again.

275
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:27,367
If this bitch still somewhere to go,
there must be water.

276
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,938
What has happened to the water?

277
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,420
Anderhalve jerrycan.

278
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:43,527
Twins zandstormen, unusually,
but not God's work.

279
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:48,683
There is, is the real enemy.

280
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:52,258
There is overshadowing the truth
and that we can not use now.

281
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:13,755
Our water is low.

282
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:19,618
What was over, the truck went,
So now our drinkflessen empty.

283
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:23,648
I thought no supplies will be needed,
but we have no other choice.

284
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:32,583
Hose 76, response, beast 92.

285
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,332
It must be that rock,
I receive nothing.

286
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:47,988
It will not be long,
the weather is good.

287
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:52,689
When should his wife gave birth?

288
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,969
I thought sometime in January.

289
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:09,214
What will he do?

290
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:17,155
A strange moment,
to look at stars.

291
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:21,431
Maybe he wants the home front
a full moon in Afghanistan show.

292
00:33:35,677 --> 00:33:37,254
Hearing you do that?

293
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:50,248
These begin.
-- Let's go.

294
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,237
See you what, chief?

295
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,454
No, not yet.

296
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,102
He sounds close.

297
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:24,775
Seek him, Cole.

298
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:31,616
Departure 01, 01 departure,
92 beast, radiocontrole.

299
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,950
Departure 01, note, I send you bad.
-- It is somewhere behind that ridge.

300
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:50,342
He is there somewhere, I believe.
-- That's because those rocky walls.

301
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,128
Departure 01, watch out, you are indiscernible,
repeat your last message.

302
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,040
Damn.

303
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,491
I think it is a form
of interference.

304
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,383
It sounds,
as if he is above us.

305
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,675
KT, shooting a torch.

306
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,158
What happened?

307
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,324
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast.

308
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:58,410
He may not have crashed,
than we had flames seen or heard something.

309
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,778
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast,
everything is okay?

310
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:05,757
Damn.

311
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:09,788
Why are they on our frequency?

312
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,002
I do not know.
-- What they say?

313
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:17,193
Abdul, you understand this?
-- No, I do not know.

314
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:20,762
That does not matter,
heli who was in the right place.

315
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:25,849
Yes, but he disappeared.
-- We do not know.

316
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,025
We must continue.
We set up a camp, on the mountain.

317
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:32,087
I thought not. How should we
Ski's body take in the dark.

318
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:37,326
We do not. We cover his body
and come back tomorrow morning.

319
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,060
I do not know boss.
-- What would you do?

320
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,845
We can not continue to wait for the bus.

321
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,316
We need that mountain
and a defensible position search.

322
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:51,891
If we encounter those bastards again,
I want to shoot down.

323
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:11,542
The team is confused,
though they did not matter.

324
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,966
It makes no sense to talk,
about something that you can not control.

325
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:31,961
That is impossible chief.

326
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,303
I've never made a mistake.
-- Why tell them that we were not there?

327
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,472
I do not know,
I've checked those numbers three times.

328
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,879
Someone has made a mistake.

329
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,795
Godverdomme.

330
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:54,052
Men, come take a look.

331
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:03,880
Who had the first watch?
-- I.

332
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:07,738
Do you have something seen or heard?
-- No, nothing.

333
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:10,861
I had the second wait,
I have not heard or seen.

334
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:14,740
This is a big mess, chief.
-- Someone wants us to graze.

335
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:21,719
Ga to the verstopplek and search Skis body.
Be careful and come back as soon as possible.

336
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:25,126
KT, I want
that we leave as soon as possible.

337
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:29,092
Abdul, you know where to find water here?
Now is the time was ripe.

338
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:32,511
Because if we find nothing within 24 hours,
we are thick in trouble.

339
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:54,049
Cursed wanted.

340
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,788
Come.

341
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,587
Sydney, this is box.

342
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,188
Sydney to box.

343
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:33,323
Chief, KT.

344
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,987
What do you feel?

345
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,840
What do you think it is?
-- I have no idea.

346
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:59,237
I do not think we want to know,
what's behind door number one. Wegwezen.

347
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,816
I have the feeling,
that they knew that we came.

348
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,493
Keynes, come.

349
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:25,702
The longer I'm here, the more convinced
I am, that I do not think the nuclear disappeared.

350
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:31,030
A voice in my head waiting out
to say, I said it anyway.

351
00:40:31,504 --> 00:40:35,615
Everyone is drinking,
store still has no meaning.

352
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,131
Where does that well?

353
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:49,418
With these two peaks as a reference,
I would say about ten, twelve miles.

354
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:53,617
I hope you certainly know Abdul.
-- I'm sure.

355
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,430
It is a small oasis.
The farmers will share their animals water,

356
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,616
the highlands before they withdraw.

357
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:01,655
Look.

358
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:14,954
My compass says that this is the north,
but then the sun in the war.

359
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,167
I suspect that we are a
large magnetic field.

360
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,687
Maybe by the iron in the rocks.

361
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:24,107
And the satelliettelefoon?
-- Nothing.

362
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:29,662
Pete, what have you on your GPS?

363
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,053
Nothing.

364
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:37,907
Abdul, it seems,
you're the ball.

365
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:44,577
Pete, you lead.
-- Okay.

366
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:47,597
We're going.

367
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:52,566
These men will not admit,
Abdul but is now the most valuable man.

368
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:56,516
We had just as good
on another planet.

369
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,859
See you move?

370
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:23,464
No.
-- Okay, we're going to check.

371
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:27,971
Chief, perhaps
a confrontation unwise.

372
00:42:28,397 --> 00:42:32,047
We're going to kill terrorists,
everything else is detail.

373
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,300
Americans?

374
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:01,945
What he says?

375
00:44:01,904 --> 00:44:09,515
I think, something that he is a warrior,
like you, but I can not do everything.

376
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:12,073
Kent Mohammed Aban he?

377
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:22,175
Thank him for the water.
We fill our veldflessen.

378
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,288
You see what he aanheeft under that mantle?

379
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:38,395
It seems a uniform. Of the Soviets?

380
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:45,024
No, British, of the 44 th regiment.

381
00:44:46,904 --> 00:44:50,204
I wonder where he came.
-- The question is, when.

382
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:53,528
The 44 th regiment no longer exists.

383
00:44:54,682 --> 00:44:57,116
The bones of hell. "
-- Where it all about?

384
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:03,440
In 1942 led the British
4500 man go here,

385
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,188
with women and children
and flight operators.

386
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:15,555
In 1944, according to legend
16000 people made the pass.

387
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,092
And only one came through it.

388
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,510
He said that he has borne witness,
a miracle of Satan.

389
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:25,794
It's just a legend.

390
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,782
Say you that this uniform on that unit?

391
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:35,084
I do not understand how it could be.
-- But the period is correct?

392
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:37,601
That's right.

393
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:43,148
I agree ga look deeper into the cave.

394
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:58,185
Aban talked about a guard,
would it be?

395
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:01,964
If so, whom he guarded?
Or what?

396
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,504
He sits in the middle of a 'hot' zone.

397
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,593
There is everywhere a low concentration of radiation.

398
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:24,786
He is in the vicinity,
I know that for sure.

399
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,850
The boys home,
want this fixed.

400
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,780
Griezelige mongrel.

401
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:16,157
Christ.

402
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:22,052
Contact.

403
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:47,223
Shit.
Jesus Cole, you blew him into the sky.

404
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,529
Cole, what happened?

405
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:54,572
I will attackers.

406
00:47:55,804 --> 00:48:00,957
Five, maybe six.
He seemed to talk with them here.

407
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,562
With their swords and pyjamas,
it seemed to wonder whether they came.

408
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:12,221
Cole, tell me exactly what you saw.
-- I could see them with my night.

409
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:19,722
He spoke with that group
and they were armed, I swear it.

410
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:21,828
We can now do nothing.

411
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:24,849
He will have allies,
we have come here for that.

412
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:27,904
Let's go.

413
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,910
Cole bowl.

414
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,480
You will not believe me anyway very much, eh?
-- Yes.

415
00:48:54,446 --> 00:48:59,256
What are you doing now?
You can not let him.

416
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:02,145
Keynes, that rule.

417
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:06,812
Abdul we have here.
It is too dangerous.

418
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:11,347
How could you do that?
You Americans killed him for nothing.

419
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:13,409
That we are not wanted,
it was an accident.

420
00:49:13,736 --> 00:49:17,497
You have buried him,
Otherwise, the accident.

421
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:21,507
Abdul, listen, we must go
there may be enemies in the vicinity.

422
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:23,933
Please, come along.

423
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,287
There is an uncertain silence cases
on the group, since we opbraken.

424
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:40,596
It is difficult to determine,
they are more worried,

425
00:49:40,963 --> 00:49:43,663
about what Cole did,
or about what he saw.

426
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:05,194
Hey Pete, five-minute break.

427
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:15,326
Stitch, my stomach is upset.

428
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:21,454
Wipe off your face.
You're dehydrated.

429
00:50:22,455 --> 00:50:25,713
Drink this.
-- Do not worry.

430
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:38,750
What do you do well, it's not funny.
-- I have not done.

431
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:44,490
I am filled with water last night.
-- Damn, man.

432
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:54,593
What happens here?

433
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:58,425
We have them refilled.

434
00:51:01,693 --> 00:51:07,882
I tell you, that we are cursed.
-- Abdul bring us to the oasis.

435
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:19,139
Nobody would like to admit,
ie that might lose control.

436
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:22,865
But it is still difficult,
if you happen to everybody sees.

437
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:27,245
Damn, this thing is worthless.
He does not even looking.

438
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:33,193
He is the kloten,
above, you should get a signal.

439
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,672
Is the battery destroyed?

440
00:51:56,714 --> 00:52:00,461
There is something wrong.
-- What's Abdul?

441
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:06,503
This is wrong.
This valley I remember not.

442
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:11,640
Make no jokes Abdul.
You said a source here.

443
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:14,858
Yes, but the path has changed.

444
00:52:19,813 --> 00:52:21,463
What about now?

445
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:27,245
Abdul has been lost.
-- Why not surprise me.

446
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:36,629
This is the peak,
then we are here.

447
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:40,914
I can agree.

448
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:46,619
Where is there than that?

449
00:52:49,285 --> 00:52:52,764
State he was not on the map?
-- It is perhaps not 100%.

450
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:56,141
But I do not believe,
that a whole piece of land they have missed.

451
00:52:58,197 --> 00:53:00,960
I do not know.
I'm sorry.

452
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:03,585
You do not have him
pre-paid Keynes eh?

453
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:08,452
He is the forgotten.
-- Yes, but we still pay him as a guide?

454
00:53:09,998 --> 00:53:15,588
Chief, perhaps the sunspots,
or a kind of interference.

455
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:21,469
That can take two days.
-- Sunspot do not sand in veldflessen.

456
00:53:21,928 --> 00:53:25,519
Well, we need somewhere
Find a place to rest.

457
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:31,190
During walking is not good.
Let's go.

458
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:37,816
Maybe this is really necessary.

459
00:53:38,168 --> 00:53:42,410
Completely lost touch
before you find what you are looking for.

460
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:03,424
Is it, buddy?
-- No, man.

461
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:08,263
It feels as if something
from inside eats at me.

462
00:54:09,728 --> 00:54:13,636
Can you give me my pills,
they sit front of my backpack.

463
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,298
This?

464
00:54:18,812 --> 00:54:20,799
Do you think we are cursed?

465
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:33,333
Not smoking if you do not have water.
-- Adjust but, di's a 'waterzoek' cigar.

466
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:42,853
What are you doing,
movie you our downfall Keynes?

467
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:48,181
What do you mean sergeant,
you intend to stay here to die?

468
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:55,840
No soldier plant his death.

469
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:06,910
It is what, in this godverlaten resort,
to work for the CIA.

470
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:14,379
What is really our goal,
Keynes agent?

471
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,389
Or should I say,
what was our goal?

472
00:55:17,866 --> 00:55:20,667
I am referring to the briefing explained.

473
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:24,492
Okay, so highly secret.

474
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:30,151
It must be very secret,
the CIA wants one of his own people send.

475
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:34,106
Usually you call it will pass through

476
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,556
and we support your back,
Cleaning up the mess?

477
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:42,112
I recognize covert operations.

478
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:47,243
So what the real mission is,
let it worth it.

479
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:53,690
You do not know what I'm with you, if I discover
Ski that died for your salary.

480
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,808
He died for his country and not for me.

481
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:03,269
McCarthy, calm to size,
we are all in the same boat.

482
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:09,452
How do you find that you can always
on the support of an Aussie.

483
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:02,452
Wake up.

484
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:09,670
Ga of myself.

485
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:13,960
He dreams.

486
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:18,887
Is everything okay?

487
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,695
Ga.

488
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,160
They called again.
-- Really?

489
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:35,337
Yes, I'm okay.
-- Cole, care for him.

490
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:44,113
Have you dysentery?
-- No, I had already ondergescheten.

491
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:48,264
If you have something to add,
it is now time for this.

492
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,635
I'm just as thirsty as you chief.

493
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:56,396
Perhaps it is this cursed place.

494
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:00,818
Find coverage.

495
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:06,033
Loop.

496
00:58:11,044 --> 00:58:13,121
What's that on?

497
00:58:19,076 --> 00:58:22,280
Too high for a truck.
-- Too quiet for a helicopter.

498
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:27,243
Where does he go?

499
00:58:27,773 --> 00:58:34,381
I see no enemies. Take Cole mee
and see what is going on.

500
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:36,224
Ok.

501
00:58:42,178 --> 00:58:47,459
Pete, ensure coverage in the back.
-- Okay, understood.

502
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:53,509
Please note.
Now.

503
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:29,589
Stop with fire.

504
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:33,969
Everyone remains in coverage.

505
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:36,974
Did you Chief?

506
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,981
That voice in my head was there again

507
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:53,493
and now was more important
than all the documents together.

508
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,320
The bones of hell '
was the story of one man.

509
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,964
But we will find evidence.
-- Chief.

510
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:10,982
Look.
-- Jesus is that all that's left?

511
01:00:15,644 --> 01:00:19,834
What do you think it was?
-- I'm not sure.

512
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,525
Certainly something,
that we have never seen.

513
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:32,300
The Taliban have no such thing,
perhaps the Soviets, something experimental.

514
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:41,781
Chief, we need here.
The camp reopening,

515
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,481
they come back down.

516
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:50,252
If we do not quickly find water,
it makes no difference.

517
01:01:22,247 --> 01:01:24,579
Hey.
-- Hello.

518
01:01:25,826 --> 01:01:29,423
We must continue. Can you walk?
-- Yes, it does so.

519
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:36,501
From him I do not know.
-- Abdul, we should go.

520
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:41,376
Damn.

521
01:01:45,888 --> 01:01:48,853
Have you not heard me Abdul?
I said that we leave.

522
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,221
We will die,
my grandfather was right.

523
01:01:54,893 --> 01:01:58,426
We never had to come from.
-- Since it is now too late.

524
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:02,313
Pack your belongings and ga.
-- I ga not with you.

525
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:06,679
Do not be dumb Abdul, if you leave us,
you will die.

526
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:10,348
We are already dead.
-- I am here spuugzat.

527
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:15,459
So you might think,
but I do not want in my team.

528
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:21,257
What is happening?
-- I spoke with your husband, Keynes.

529
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:23,357
He said ...
-- Abdul, no.

530
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:35,199
Wacky bastard.

531
01:02:37,871 --> 01:02:40,689
He did not much for us.
-- We had him.

532
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,833
What? He led us ...
-- I tell you, we had him.

533
01:02:45,255 --> 01:02:48,128
Certainly not to find water.
Or perhaps Aban?

534
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,812
There is more.

535
01:02:50,129 --> 01:02:52,116
Tell us damn,
what that means more?

536
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:55,928
I tell only what you need to know, chief.
-- Make a joke.

537
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:58,119
Who is there now know more than we do?

538
01:02:58,456 --> 01:03:03,061
He bastard, I lost all three men
during this damned quest of you.

539
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:05,884
And now let me know what this is all about.

540
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:09,691
Tell us what is going on.
What was that thing last night.

541
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:12,428
We do not know.
-- We?

542
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:17,437
You and those lulletjes in Langley?
-- Listen ... Chief,

543
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:23,381
all I can say is that I work
for a special department within the CIA.

544
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:27,052
Wonderful as that.
We are here to die,

545
01:03:27,447 --> 01:03:31,078
while you are on spokenjacht?
I personally shoot a bullet in you.

546
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:35,435
We have orders to follow chief.
-- Perhaps you know it yet,

547
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,133
but dead men do not follow orders.

548
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:03,370
I want to tell them,
I realize that I must tell.

549
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:07,555
In my head I browse all protocols,
all secrets

550
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:12,734
and wonder, what is the point of
death to go, that everything in my head?

551
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:17,423
What will they do,
with the information I send them?

552
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,841
Mohammed Aban know.
He knew the whole time.

553
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:25,292
But he still alive?

554
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:07,239
Keynes, what is there?

555
01:05:42,228 --> 01:05:44,415
What is there, you saw something?

556
01:05:48,184 --> 01:05:50,958
I saw Mohammed Aban.
-- Do you love me for a ride?

557
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:52,682
Look.

558
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,020
What's that damn thing for?
-- No idea.

559
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:03,918
But I think that this is your chief men killed.
Here I was looking for.

560
01:06:05,057 --> 01:06:06,856
That is why I am here.

561
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:11,598
I do not, it is a weapon?
-- We do not know.

562
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,462
Something of the Soviets?

563
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:18,661
We can not fight against,
if you do not say what it is.

564
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:30,699
Okay, sergeant.
Get your men.

565
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,279
How long do you know this already?

566
01:06:41,356 --> 01:06:45,588
Since the tachtigerjaren,
when we Moedjahadin trained.

567
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:53,652
We tried to use this area,
to trainingkampen there.

568
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,045
But we discovered,
that everything here was dead.

569
01:06:57,421 --> 01:07:00,713
What do you mean by death?
-- Nothing worked.

570
01:07:01,114 --> 01:07:06,437
Radios, compasses, nothing that
with electromagnetic radiation.

571
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:13,265
So my group began an investigation.

572
01:07:13,792 --> 01:07:19,862
In 2000 we saw something,
an image.

573
01:07:20,382 --> 01:07:24,556
A satellite image.
-- What you saw?

574
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:32,517
Have you ever heard of the Vimanas?
-- No, never.

575
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:39,297
I very much, they occur in the Asian foklore,
in particular in India.

576
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:46,821
A kind of UFO, but then triangular.

577
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:51,318
Alexander the Great wrote,
that his troops attacked them.

578
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:56,398
He called them "flying shields."
-- So this is a damned UFO hunt.

579
01:07:56,858 --> 01:08:02,271
No chief, it was identified.
There is evidence.

580
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:06,315
We believe that it is a weapon,
with unprecedented force.

581
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:08,931
And why were you and your men selected.

582
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:12,555
What does it matter if we find that thing
while dying?

583
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,220
Not just research, eh?

584
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:23,043
Listen, this is my connection
with the outside world.

585
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:28,593
Your camera?
What are you talking about Keynes?

586
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:35,805
I have forwarded optical images,
laserverbinding through this.

587
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:39,833
Great.
-- And that you tell us now pas?

588
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,711
So your people follow us all the time al
They know where we are today.

589
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:51,115
This is the only way,
to collect irrefutable evidence.

590
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:54,853
We did not know,
whether anyone would return.

591
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:59,173
This is insane.
-- This is a damned suicidal.

592
01:08:59,577 --> 01:09:03,264
There is a huge difference,
between suicide and sacrifice.

593
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:08,350
Precisely, this is the difference,
you bastard.

594
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,520
This is larger than ourselves together,
So calm.

595
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,932
I would suggest you should neerknallen,
for what you aandeed my men.

596
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:18,878
Your men were patriots chief.
-- Those were my friends.

597
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,644
I understand that.

598
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:47,709
That is enough.

599
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:02,857
So do not go chief.
I'm not the enemy.

600
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:06,562
That would be just as well you can.

601
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:15,822
I'm sorry sergeant.

602
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:30,039
I am prepared to die for my country,
but this ...

603
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,613
I do not know whether this is life or death.

604
01:10:33,641 --> 01:10:36,301
Maybe there is something in between.

605
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:51,889
Keynes is awake.
-- What is happening?

606
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:57,237
The Chief is gone.
-- How long already?

607
01:11:57,668 --> 01:12:02,480
No idea, he left his gun behind,
I do not know why.

608
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:05,246
We must adopt
that he did not return.

609
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:10,578
What's new with Degetau?
-- Not very well.

610
01:12:11,968 --> 01:12:16,376
Can you do not pass through your connection,
that they should come and collect him?

611
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:21,055
They will not come.
-- Look at him.

612
01:12:21,445 --> 01:12:26,615
He is not useful for the mission.
-- We are the mission, sergeant.

613
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:30,663
See you do not,
Our goal is to find the Vimanas,

614
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:34,339
their goal is to see what happens,
if we succeed.

615
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:38,440
The end justifies the means.
-- That is the problem, eh?

616
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:41,332
We seem never to reach the end.

617
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:44,952
We must continue.

618
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:50,363
Is that what I think it is?
-- They are the bones of hell. "

619
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,177
Unbelievable.

620
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:58,620
It seems that we are in hell.
-- Near in any case.

621
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:12,003
I have no doubt that this is the
print, which we saw from space.

622
01:14:12,402 --> 01:14:15,613
The fate of humanity,
displayed here for us.

623
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:21,402
Is this a message, a warning?
Am I the messenger?

624
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:33,855
What is happening?
-- Watch.

625
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:44,612
My God.
They are the.

626
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,647
My God, get me here.

627
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,818
How should we fight against something?

628
01:15:24,005 --> 01:15:25,708
Then we do not.

629
01:15:49,787 --> 01:15:51,863
I must go, okay?

630
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:54,638
For it is too dark.

631
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,397
Are you too late for a meeting?

632
01:16:20,197 --> 01:16:22,091
Klootzak.

633
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:29,648
I can not bear.
-- Then you had better go.

634
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:39,133
You're a good soldier.
Your country will be proud.

635
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:43,540
My country will never know who I am.

636
01:16:47,571 --> 01:16:49,027
Goodbye.

637
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:18,495
Something tells me that I should proceed.

638
01:17:18,865 --> 01:17:21,231
In order to search for water, or anything else.

639
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,994
I'm really not anymore.

640
01:17:25,115 --> 01:17:29,145
I seem to know the direction,
but not the destination.

641
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:36,066
Am I being led, or is it a tragic
to attempt to die with dignity.

642
01:17:37,802 --> 01:17:40,395
Is there any dignity?

643
01:18:17,631 --> 01:18:20,097
Ga to your God, as a soldier.

644
01:25:22,346 --> 01:25:24,252
It will save us all.

645
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:42,407
Stacey Okay, let's get started,
when your man departed.

646
01:25:42,825 --> 01:25:46,212
Can you tell us something about his mission?

647
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:55,457
It is almost a year,
in november.

648
01:25:56,832 --> 01:26:02,479
He did not speak much about his mission,
because he works for the CIA.

649
01:26:03,144 --> 01:26:11,732
But I know he was in Afghanistan
and a special someone was looking for.

650
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,199
Your husband worked in a special group
within the CIA, is that correct?

651
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:19,535
Yes, that's what he told me.

652
01:26:19,912 --> 01:26:23,482
You know whether there is still more of that group
disappeared?

653
01:26:25,016 --> 01:26:29,205
I know that he would take a team

654
01:26:29,645 --> 01:26:33,395
and that they would help him
Mohammed search,

655
01:26:34,976 --> 01:26:37,126
but I do not know who they are.

656
01:26:38,117 --> 01:26:41,119
Nobody seems to know something.

657
01:26:42,086 --> 01:26:46,453
I do not,
they can still remember him?

658
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,113
He devoted his life to his country.

659
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:55,533
That diary you have there,
is that the only evidence from that period?

660
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:03,700
It was me a few weeks
After his departure sent.

661
01:27:05,073 --> 01:27:10,062
I know it is him.
I recognize his handwriting, despite the codes.

662
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,700
I just want to know whether he is still alive.
