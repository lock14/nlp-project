More rain tomorrow
with the chance of thunderstorms...
Mikey, quit playing,
get ready for school.
Come on, start eating. Your
mom's coming in 10 minutes.
Hey, were you
messing with this?
No.
No. Bet you were.
I bet you were fooling around.
I'll get it.
All right.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Jane.
Mikey, you want more juice?
Sure.
Here you go.
Yeah, no problem.
Okay. See you.
Jane can't make it.
Why not?
She didn't say.
Didn't say what?
Your mom can't pick you up.
Does that mean
I miss school?
No. It means
I take you instead.
Nice try, tiger.
It was a nice try, though.
Where you going, baby?
My publishers. They're
gonna show me the cover.
Wow. You look great.
Thanks.
You look really great.
You look really, really great.
No, John, we're late already.
And you have toothpaste on your mouth.
Right there.
You Okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Well,
I might be more than okay.
Oh, my God in heaven.
Yes!
Yes, yes!
This could be wrong.
I'll do another one.
Let's tell Mike
he's got a brother.
Wait. I'll do another test
and then see the doctor.
Congratulations, honey.
Lunch bag.
Suit bag.
Kiss.
All right. See you
in a couple of days.
Say hi to your mom.
And you, take it easy.
I know.
Hey!
Bye. I love you.
See you later.
Don't worry.
Hi, Joseph.
How you doing?
Mr. Rivers.
Hey.
Frank asked if you'd call
as soon as you're in.
Oh. Sure.
Wow.
Wow what?
You. You're smiling.
Is that a big deal
that I'm smiling?
It is on a Monday morning, yeah.
Really?
Really.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, Karen,
order me a bouquet of flowers
for the end of the day, lilies.
And champa... No, not
champagne, get me chocolates.
Those Belgian kind.
You know?
What are you looking at?
Something's up.
Something's really up.
Would you just...
I'm going.
Thank you.
But I know something's up.
Frank.
Hey, babe, are you home?
You have one message.
Message received
Monday 16th, 6:07 p.m.
Hey, honey, it's me. So Julie's
having trouble with Ben, again.
What's new?
So I said I'd have
a drink with her.
Don't worry,
I'll stick to water,
and I'll call when
I'm on my way home.
Did you see the demo cover?
What do you think?
I was kind of thinking...
No messages
Hi, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the beep
and I will call you back.
Hi, it's me,
it's a little before midnight.
I guess you're
still with Julie.
Give me a call, let me know.
All right? Love you, bye.
Hi, it's Julie.
Leave a message.
Julie, hi, it's
John. Do me a favor.
When you get this message,
have Anna give me a call.
I guess you guys are having a good time.
Thank you.
...victim of a tragic accident.
Police have discovered
the heel of a woman's shoe
close to her abandoned car
on Argyle Avenue.
She may have
slipped into the river
while attending
to a flat tire.
Although divers are
still searching the area,
reported sightings of
the best-selling author
continue to reach police from
towns up to 20 miles away.
Police are keeping an open
mind as to her whereabouts.
Anna Rivers' latest
novel The Eternal Wait
is scheduled for
release this fall
and her husband,
architect Jonathan Rivers,
is said to be taking time out to
accompany her on her promotional tour.
We're gonna get going.
Okay.
Come on, Michael.
Mark will be home
in a minute, so...
Okay. Okay.
Come on, pal, say
goodbye to your dad.
Come here.
Be a good boy. Take care of your mom.
Go get your stuff.
Hey, there's a bed at
our place if you want it.
Oh. Thanks. Jane, you don't have
to put yourself out for me.
I know I wasn't
a very good...
Oh, John.
Okay.
It's 10 days
now since international author
Anna Rivers' car was found...
Although police still
suspect she could have drowned,
they are not ruling out
the possibility of abduction.
Architect husband Jonathan Rivers,
spoke of his anguish today...
Three weeks since the
disappearance of author Anna Rivers.
Police say they
are constructing
a profile of
a likely abductor.
Distraught husband
Jonathan Rivers...
...had this message for anyone
who may know of her whereabouts.
It's difficult
But you never
give up hope, ever.
It's the only way to get by.
I got 50 guys and thousands of
dollars' worth of equipment waiting,
so if you want to tell them
to wait a month, call me.
My goodness.
You were outside my house.
I'm sorry.
You were outside my house
and now you're
outside my office.
Don't insult my intelligence by
telling me that's a coincidence.
No, it's no coincidence.
Do I know you?
My name is Raymond Price.
Are you following me?
It's about Anna, Mr. Rivers.
I've been receiving messages
from her, from the other side.
From what other side?
Jonathan,
your wife is dead.
I have proof.
She's been
trying to communicate
ever since the
moment of her death.
Look, Mr. Rivers, my son
died when he was 12.
For years
I'd been suicidal.
Look. Just stay
away from me.
But then someone should have
told me
what I have told you.
That my son, my dead son,
had made contact.
And he had, Mr. Rivers, it was true.
From the other side.
And he was happy. Happy.
Please. Yes.
And also at ease.
And it changed my life,
Mr. Rivers,
because then I knew.
So please, please,
Mr. Rivers,
put this in a drawer,
hide it, forget about it,
but please
don't throw it away.
Because, one day,
you will want to know.
My thoughts are
with you both.
It's Anna Rivers.
The fabulous Anna
Rivers carrying groceries.
Stop it
How was shopping?
Turn it off.
Okay. Just...
There's one of
her best features.
Shut up.
That's a beautiful
thing, ladies and gentlemen.
The body of
internationally renowned author Anna Rivers
was discovered last night by a security
guard making a routine visit...
...to the disused
pier 16, three miles upriver
from where her car
was found abandoned
five weeks ago
on Argyle Avenue.
The discovery
brings to an end...
Before she drowned,
your wife sustained
injuries consistent
with a fall onto
the rocks by the river.
The damage to the head,
the break to the arm.
When the tide came in, she would
have been unable to help herself.
She would have been swept
upstream several miles.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Divers recovered
her personal effects.
Her cell phone was in her car,
and we're returning it to you.
Thank you for giving her
to us, her family and friends,
to know and to love as a companion
on our earthly pilgrimage.
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life,
so that in quiet confidence we
may continue our course on Earth
until, by your call,
we are reunited
with those who
have gone before.
Amen.
Amen.
So what do you think?
I love it.
Yeah?
Yeah. It's nice here.
All right.
It's a fresh start.
I guess.
Could you...
Could you take
Mikey for the weekend?
Yeah, of course.
Maybe...
Maybe a little longer.
As long as you want, John.
We're gonna go
lay the floor now.
When do you
want to bring them?
They'd like to
see you this week.
Sure. Fine,
it shouldn't be any problem.
Whoops.
Whoops.
You brought me here just
to do that, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Let me see what I can do here.
This is where you tell me you're
running over budget, right?
Shit. Keep doing that!
I'm sorry,
I didn't...
Ask them if they have a light.
You guys Okay?
We are now.
Yeah.
I trust you'll fix this
before Mr. Cunningham arrives.
Anna?
Jonathan
You have one message.

Wednesday 23rd, 2:30 a.m.
Jonathan
End of message.
You have no messages.
You have no messages.
You have no messages.
Oh! Please, come. How nice.
Hello.
Hi.
Look... I was just about
to finish with someone.
I can come back.
No, it won't take long.
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.
Thank you.
This is Sarah Tate.
Let me introduce you
to Mr. Rivers.
Sorry, I'm a little...
We've had
a breakthrough today.
It's incredible.
It truly is.
This is ridiculous.
Stay awhile.
I should get these
boxes back to the store.
Sarah, there's
no need to hurry.
Make yourself
a cup of tea.
I suppose. Thank you.
Would you like one?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Rivers, please.
Oh, excuse me.
Please, sit here. Sit.
So, have you heard
of E.V.P., Mr. Rivers?
No.
I'm not surprised. Those
that have call us cranks.
E.V.P. stands for
electronic voice phenomenon.
I'm listening.
Well.
I'm not a clairvoyant,
I'm not a medium,
I don't contact the dead,
the dead contact me.
And, With E.V.P.,
I can hear them,
I can see them,
and I can record them.
I understand...
...you shouldn't be...
And they are...
That's right.
People that have passed over.
Is this your job,
or a hobby, or what?
I think obsession would be
more appropriate,
to be honest.
Now, I wonder where...
Here we are. They don't always
appear visually the first few times.
We tend only to
pick up their voices
and people can
find that frustrating.
But when it works,
and you see
the faces of the people
that you're able
to help, like Sarah,
nothing, believe me,
nothing comes close.
Mr. Rivers, do you
want to hear your wife?
Yes.
Jonathan
Jonathan.
Find him.
Jonathan Rivers. Find him.
Jonathan.
Jonathan Rivers.
Find him, please.
The frustrating thing about E.V.P.
is it's not live.
You need to make the recording
and you'll only know if you've got
results when you play it back.
Here. It has milk.
Perfect. Thank you.
Excuse me for a moment.
It's an amazing
feeling, isn't it?
It's indescribable.
It took a few visits to get
used to it, but it's addictive.
I'm here all the time.
He's really helped me.
I try to help him when I can, so I
keep some of this stuff at the store.
What store?
I have a bookstore.
Your wife was a wonderful
writer, Mr. Rivers.
Yeah.
So what made you come here?
My fiance.
He died eight months ago.
We've had trouble
deciphering
what he's been saying,
but this afternoon
we cracked it.
Only two words,
"Sarah, yes."
Because, before he died,
he promised me
that if it was
like they say it is
that he would find
a way of getting to me
and letting me know
that he's happy.
So, "Sarah, yes."
Oh.
Raymond thinks
we probably won't
see him again now,
but that's okay.
And I've heard
what I wanted to hear.
Anna...
This is John.
If there's any way
you can hear me,
will you please let me know?
Please.
Just any kind of...
Just any kind of sign.
Please.
Susie.
Susie.
Susie, I...
I recorded this
a few hours ago.
It's quite faint, so I
had to save it as a sound
file on the computer
to enhance the sound.
So...
She knows that I visited?
I believe so.
So will I get to see
her this time? No.
This will just be sound.
I'm sorry, John, we have
to be a little patient.
Trust me, John, this is just
the beginning. Sit, here.
Now...
If you want to hear it again,
just press that key.
I'll be back in a moment.
Tell him
because I love him.
Tell him because I love him.
Bastard. Bastard.
Bastard.
What was that?
It's okay, it's okay.
We do have some very
bad people out there.
You just have to press that
and they're all gone.
We've had a step towards
visual contact with Anna.
Let's celebrate that.
Here.
They can't all be nice,
they can't all be Anna.
Susie Tomlinson, smile.
Susie Tomlinson...
Hello?
It's Raymond.
Something's happening.
Really?
Get over here.
I'm on my way.
Hello?
Raymond?
So you'll tell me
whatever you find out?
I can't tell you any more than
you'll read in the papers.
But if you can think of
anything else, here, call me.
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you for
coming to the service.
It would've
meant a lot to him.
Thank you for
doing this for me.
I'm not sure where to start. He
was working off a disk, so...
Maybe Anna's original tapes
might be in one of these boxes.
You all right?
I still can't
believe he's gone.
Well...
Maybe he'll be in touch.
I don't know.
Said he'd made enough of a nuisance
of himself while he was alive.
Just doesn't make any sense.
He was helping people.
Wow. These go back years.
Twenty-three, to be precise.
"Carol should know.
"Tell Thomas he should.
"Men in the room."
Here's one,
"$500 still there."
That's the kind of message I like.
Yeah.
There we go.
Why do we got so many?
So you can watch
your favorite show
and I can watch
my favorite show.
Yeah.
Okay...
They're showing
me something.
It's...
It's...
Willow Avenue. They're showing
me Willow Avenue. Yes?
No. No. No.
Okay, it's no problem.
Sometimes it happens.
Your wife, she passed
over recently.
Yeah.
Her passing was difficult.
Yeah.
She was...
She's a writer.
She was a writer.
Yeah, her words
are important.
I'm sorry, the light
is way too bright.
It's like these tiny,
noisy, little pinpoints.
It's making it hard
to see anything at all.
It's electronic voice...
I know what this is.
I've been making tapes...
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't try this by
yourself, it's not safe.
It's like
homemade Ouija boards
and teenage
seances at Halloween.
E.V.P. is not good.
We spend years developing our
relationships with our guides
so that we can protect you.
From what?
The ones who like damage.
'Cause they are out there
and they will find you.
If you're gonna keep
insisting on meddling, then...
Anna, my wife,
she sent me a sign.
No. No. Not Anna.
You are misreading everything.
Listen, it is one thing to contact
the dead, it is another to meddle,
and you are meddling.
I just came because
I wanted some help.
I know, I can help you.
It's just that they are urging
me to tell you to stop.
Right. Thank you.
Mr. Rivers...
Willow Avenue. Are you sure? They
keep showing me Willow Avenue.
No.
No Willow Avenue, no Willow
Street, no Willow Terrace.
Mr. Rivers.
She was pregnant. Yes?
We play every day.
He says
you are happier now.
Did I die?
Susie.
Susie Tomlinson...
Smile.
Susie Tomlinson.
Smile.
Excuse me.
Are you Susie Tomlinson?
Yeah. My name's Jonathan Rivers.
Hi.
May I speak to you?
My mother died
giving birth to me.
And my grandmother, she tried for
years to make contact with her.
You know, with candles,
darkness and smoke...
Seances?
Yeah.
All of that,
she tried everything.
She used to tell me
that when she died she'd let
me know if she found her,
if she found my mother.
Whenever I was sad,
she nagged me to cheer up.
She would say, "Susie Tomlinson,
look on the brighter side.
"Susie Tomlinson, lighten up.
"Susie Tomlinson, smile."
They've found each other.
Haven't they?
That's what she
wanted me to know.
It's like she
didn't really die.
I get the call from my
father and then, what,
like two days
later you come by?
It's like she just
carried straight on.
Susie, I don't understand.
I've been getting messages from
your grandmother for a week.
No, that can't be. She just
passed away two days ago.
They are ruling
nothing out in the case
of missing mother
of two, Mary Freeman.
It's been nine days
since she left her house...
Where are we gonna eat now?
On our laps.
There you go. It works.
What's that, Dad?
That means it's time for us to
go pack up your gear. Come on.
One, two, three.
That's it.
Next week, can I watch a video and
you watch a video like you said?
Yep, but only if
you're good and ready
for when your mom
comes to pick you up.
Okay.
Daddy.
Yeah.
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah.
I promise.
John.
John.
John, my love.
John. John.
Anna.
Anna, baby.
John, my love.
Please, get my...
Please...
John.
John.
Go.
Please!
I know.
John, my love.
Go.
John, my love.
Willow Avenue.
Go.
Go.
Go now.
Please, John.
Willow Avenue.
Please, John.
Willow Avenue.
Please! Please, get my baby!
Please.
Get my baby. Please.
Please.
Hi.
Hi.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah, sure.
How's he doing?
He's good. Gets
a little better every day.
How are you?
I should...
Sorry. Thanks again.
Yeah. Okay.
Mr. Black.
John...
Mr. Black.
This is gonna sound strange,
but I need to tell you.
I went to Willow
Avenue because your wife
reached out to me,
she asked for help.
That's the thing.
She wanted help.
I am grateful for
what you did, Mr. Rivers.
My son wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for you. So thank you.
But now I'd like
you to leave us alone.
Mr. Black...
Carol may have believed
your bullshit, but not me.
So you and
your sick friends,
you stay the fuck away from me and my family.
You understand?
You stay away.
Number one,
they're not dead.
When I see them,
they're not dead.
She shows me things
that haven't happened.
Things that haven't happened?
Right.
Number two, she's showing
me things that are here,
not somewhere else
where I can't do anything.
She doesn't show me
an earthquake in India
or some bomb in
the Middle East,
they're here in this city where
I can maybe do something.
I've seen things that haven't happened yet.
You understand?
I can see how you're
putting it together.
Putting it... Putting it together?
What do you mean?
She wants me to help.
I couldn't help
Carol Black.
But I can help them.
Jonathan Rivers' office.
Karen, cancel
my appointments
for the next few days.
Are you all right?
I need a few days.
Take care of yourself.
Yeah, I will.
ll' hurts.
Stop.
She's ours.
She's ours.
John, my love.
Willow Avenue.
Stop, you pig. Willow Avenue.
It's the same voice.
When I was at Raymond's, he
had been receiving messages,
angry, violent messages.
Now I'm getting
the same thing, Sarah.
But from whom?
I don't know.
Sarah.
Edith Tomlinson, 207.
I was getting messages from
Susie Tomlinson's grandmother.
She was trying to reach her
dead daughter, Susie's mother.
"Edith Tomlinson. Daughter
died giving birth, tapes 200 to 208."
Susie's grandmother.
She was visiting Raymond.
Probably just a coincidence.
Look for Carol Black,
the woman in the car.
Remember what
her husband said?
"My wife might have been into
that shit, but I wasn't."
"Carol Black. General
interest, tape number 231
Raymond had lists of clients.
You've seen only two.
I've seen hundreds of faces. It
could be the same with all of them.
I'm in there, you're in there,
Edith Tomlinson, Carol Black...
There's too much else.
It's a coincidence.
Mary Freeman.
The missing woman.
She's on my tapes.
I've seen her.
She's on my tapes.
First they visit Raymond.
Then I see them.
Then they die.
What are you doing? If she's
alive, Anna will show her to me.
We don't know that
everyone you see is alive.
Susie's grandmother,
Carol Black.
What about Anna?
Anna's different.
She's helping me.
We don't know
what's happening here.
I do.
If Mary Freeman's
on these tapes,
she might be alive
and we can save her.
Sarah!
Sarah, come here!
Look at this. Come here.
Come here. Look at this.
Hear that?
That's her.
Oh, my God.
She's alive.
Go. Go now.
Go where, baby?
John...
Anna, go where?
Please, John. Go!
Go... Go where, baby?
Go now!
Go where?
Go where?
Damn it! She's gonna die.
You don't know that.
She's on the tape.
She's on the tape.
She's gonna die.
John.
John.
It hurts.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What if I don't wake up?
You will.
I promise you will.
You will stay with me?
Sure.
Sure.
Promise?
Promise.
Thank you.
Sarah?
God.
That's as much
as we can say right now.
There's a 30, 40% chance
she might pull through.
Let's hope she's okay.
Thanks again for your help.
Mr. Rivers.
Neighbors say they
saw you on the balcony
when Miss Tate fell.
Is that true?
I was trying to stop her.
From falling?
Well, she was
on the balcony.
Any idea why she
was on the balcony?
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
I'll give you some time,
but we'll need
a full statement from you.
Are you heading home soon?
I'm not leaving town,
if that's what you mean.
Okay. I may
come by later then.
John.
Hey, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.
It hurts.
It hurts.
John.
Go.
Go now, John.
Go.
Go now.
Please, John.
No.
Mr. Rivers?
Hello.
This is John Rivers. I think
I've found Mary Freeman.
Hello.
I'm at pier 16.
Can you hear me, Smits?
Damn it.
Oh, my God!
John.
John, my love.
John.
Anna.
Anna, you have
to help me, please.
Go.
Anna, you have to
help me find Mary.
Please, John.
Please, John.
Go now.
Go now.
Please, John.
Go now.
They talk to me, John.
This was their idea.
All their idea.
She was beautiful, John.
I brought her to them.
They were very
pleased with me.
...Argyle Avenue, suggests she
may have slipped into the river...
Damage to the head,
the break to the arm...
Anna!
This was their idea.
You guys Okay?
No!
She's ours!
Men in the room.
Sir?
O God
of grace and glory,
we remember before you this
day our brother Jonathan.
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life
so that in quiet confidence...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mikey.
Let's go.
We commit
the body to the ground.
From earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
Last time I talked to you
You were lonely
and out of place
You were looking down on me
Lost out in space
Laid underneath the stars
Strung-out and feeling brave
Watch the riddles glow
Watch them float away
Down here in the atmosphere
Garbage and city lights
You gonna save
your tired soul
You're gonna save our lives
Turned on the radio
To find you on satellite
I'm waiting
for the sky to fall
I'm waiting for a sign
And all we are
ls all so far
You're falling back to me
The star that I can't see
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
Hope you remember me
When you're homesick
and need a change
I miss your purple hair
I miss the way you taste
I know you'll
come back some day
On a bed of nails I wait
I'm praying that
you don't burn out
Or fade away
And all we are
ls all so far
You're falling back to me
The star that I can't see
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling back to me
The star that I can't see
I know you're out there
Oh
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling back to me
The star that I can't see
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling back to me
I know, I know
Oh
You're falling out of reach
I know
