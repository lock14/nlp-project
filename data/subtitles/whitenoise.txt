00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:21,877
<i>More rain tomorrow
with the chance of thunderstorms...</i>

2
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,624
Mikey, quit playing,
get ready for school.

3
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:04,461
Come on, start eating. Your
mom's coming in 10 minutes.

4
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:08,331
Hey, were you
messing with this?

5
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,441
No.

6
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,844
No. Bet you were.
I bet you were fooling around.

7
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:16,515
I'll get it.
All right.

8
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,810
Hello.

9
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,061
Oh, hi, Jane.

10
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,397
Mikey, you want more juice?
Sure.

11
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,773
Here you go.

12
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,191
Yeah, no problem.

13
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,860
Okay. See you.

14
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,113
Jane can't make it.

15
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:32,281
Why not?

16
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,615
She didn't say.

17
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,033
Didn't say what?

18
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,868
Your mom can't pick you up.

19
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,745
Does that mean
I miss school?

20
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,833
No. It means
I take you instead.

21
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,043
Nice try, tiger.

22
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,006
It was a nice try, though.

23
00:03:58,849 --> 00:03:59,907
Where you going, baby?

24
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:03,478
My publishers. They're
gonna show me the cover.

25
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,274
Wow. You look great.

26
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:08,358
Thanks.

27
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,902
You look really great.

28
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,448
You look really, really great.

29
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:19,703
No, John, we're late already.

30
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:25,083
And you have toothpaste on your mouth.
Right there.

31
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:36,511
You Okay?

32
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,763
Yeah.

33
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:43,769
You sure?
Well,

34
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,980
I might be more than okay.

35
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,611
Oh, my God in heaven.

36
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,529
Yes!

37
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:56,239
Yes, yes!

38
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,686
This could be wrong.
I'll do another one.

39
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,331
Let's tell Mike
he's got a brother.

40
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:06,424
Wait. I'll do another test
and then see the doctor.

41
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:08,835
Congratulations, honey.

42
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,261
Lunch bag.

43
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,805
Suit bag.

44
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:21,640
Kiss.

45
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,602
All right. See you
in a couple of days.

46
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:26,686
Say hi to your mom.

47
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:29,981
And you, take it easy.

48
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,318
I know.

49
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:40,826
Hey!

50
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,124
Bye. I love you.

51
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,419
See you later.
Don't worry.

52
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,529
Hi, Joseph.
How you doing?

53
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,450
Mr. Rivers.
Hey.

54
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,994
Frank asked if you'd call
as soon as you're in.

55
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,078
Oh. Sure.

56
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,998
Wow.

57
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,709
Wow what?
You. You're smiling.

58
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,017
Is that a big deal
that I'm smiling?

59
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,255
It is on a Monday morning, yeah.
Really?

60
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:37,299
Really.
Okay.

61
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,342
Yeah.
Hey, Karen,

62
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:42,888
order me a bouquet of flowers
for the end of the day, lilies.

63
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,017
And champa... No, not
champagne, get me chocolates.

64
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,643
Those Belgian kind.

65
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,938
You know?
What are you looking at?

66
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,608
Something's up.

67
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:59,529
Something's really up.
Would you just...

68
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,032
I'm going.
Thank you.

69
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,284
But I know something's up.
Frank.

70
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,749
Hey, babe, are you home?

71
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,598
You have one message.

72
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:31,481
<i>Message received
Monday 16th, 6:07 p.m.</i>

73

having trouble with Ben, again.</i>

74
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,176
What's new?

75
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,936
<i>So I said I'd have
a drink with her.</i>

76
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,921
<i>Don't worry,
I'll stick to water,</i>

77
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:43,949
<i>and I'll call when
I'm on my way home.</i>

78
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:47,077
<i>Did you see the demo cover?
What do you think?</i>

79
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,996
<i>I was kind of thinking...</i>

80
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,419
<i>No messages</i>

81
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,830
<i>Hi, it's Anna.</i>

82
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:34,558
<i>Leave a message after the beep
and I will call you back.</i>

83
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:37,294
Hi, it's me,
it's a little before midnight.

84
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:39,588
I guess you're
still with Julie.

85
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:43,216
Give me a call, let me know.
All right? Love you, bye.

86
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,511
<i>Hi, it's Julie.
Leave a message.</i>

87
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,888
<i>Julie, hi, it's
John. Do me a favor.</i>

88
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:52,851
When you get this message,
have Anna give me a call.

89
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:56,313
I guess you guys are having a good time.
Thank you.

Oh. Thanks. Jane, you don't have

to wait a month, call me.

My goodness.
You were outside my house.

132
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,186
I'm sorry.
You were outside my house

133
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,896
and now you're
outside my office.

134
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:34,108
Don't insult my intelligence by
telling me that's a coincidence.

135
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,611
No, it's no coincidence.

136
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:39,739

00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,824
My name is Raymond Price.

138
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,369
Are you following me?

139
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,454
It's about Anna, Mr. Rivers.

140
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:51,250
I've been receiving messages
from her, from the other side.

141
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,964
From what other side?

142
00:14:56,047 --> 00:15:00,134
Jonathan,
your wife is dead.

143
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,351
I have proof.

144
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,311
She's been
trying to communicate

145
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,071
ever since the
moment of her death.

146
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:16,526
Look, Mr. Rivers, my son
died when he was 12.

147
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,027
For years
I'd been suicidal.

148
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,071
Look. Just stay
away from me.

149
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,615
But then someone should have
told me

150
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:23,992
what I have told you.

151
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,869
That my son, my dead son,
had made contact.

152
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:30,581
And he had, Mr. Rivers, it was true.
From the other side.

153
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,583
And he was happy. Happy.

154
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,837
Please. Yes.
And also at ease.

155
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,757
And it changed my life,
Mr. Rivers,

156
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,634
because then I knew.

157
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:45,304
So please, please,
Mr. Rivers,

158
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,182
put this in a drawer,
hide it, forget about it,

159
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:50,935
but please
don't throw it away.

160
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,062
Because, one day,

161
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,315
you will want to know.

162
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:01,487
My thoughts are
with you both.

163
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,460

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,298

166
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:23,468
<i>How was shopping?</i>

167
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,428

Okay. Just...</i>

<i>There's one of
her best features.</i>

169
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:28,556

170
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,601

177
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,812
<i>Before she drowned,</i>

178
00:17:57,895 --> 00:18:00,356
<i>your wife sustained
injuries consistent</i>

179
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,942
<i>with a fall onto
the rocks by the river.</i>

180
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:07,905
<i>The damage to the head,
the break to the arm.</i>

181
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:14,495
<i>When the tide came in, she would
have been unable to help herself.</i>

182
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,166
<i>She would have been swept
upstream several miles.</i>

183
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:19,584
<i>I'm so sorry for your loss.</i>

184
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,304
<i>Divers recovered
her personal effects.</i>

185
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:34,807
<i>Her cell phone was in her car,
and we're returning it to you.</i>

186
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:38,019
Thank you for giving her
to us, her family and friends,

187
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:42,190
to know and to love as a companion
on our earthly pilgrimage.

188
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:45,860
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life,

189
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:50,198
so that in quiet confidence we
may continue our course on Earth

190
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,533
until, by your call,
we are reunited

191
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,952
with those who
have gone before.

192
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:57,038
Amen.
Amen.

193
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,069
So what do you think?
I love it.

194
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,279
Yeah?
Yeah. It's nice here.

195
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:31,758
All right.
It's a fresh start.

196
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,741
I guess.

197
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,996
Could you...

198
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:42,541
Could you take
Mikey for the weekend?

199
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,835
Yeah, of course.

200
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:49,173
Maybe...
Maybe a little longer.

201
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,176
As long as you want, John.

202
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,396
We're gonna go
lay the floor now.

203
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,068
When do you
want to bring them?

204
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,774
They'd like to
see you this week.

205
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:55,740
Sure. Fine,
it shouldn't be any problem.

206
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,202
Whoops.
Whoops.

207
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:06,167
You brought me here just
to do that, didn't you?

208
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,670
No, I didn't.
Let me see what I can do here.

209
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,258
This is where you tell me you're
running over budget, right?

210
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,558
Shit. Keep doing that!

211
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:24,560
I'm sorry,
I didn't...

212
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:36,889
Ask them if they have a light.

213
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,165
You guys Okay?

214
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,458
We are now.

215
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,001
Yeah.

216
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:52,254
I trust you'll fix this
before Mr. Cunningham arrives.

217
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,056
Anna?

218
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:30,853
Jonathan

219
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,583
You have one message.

220
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:57,883
<i>Message received
Wednesday 23rd, 2:30 a.m.</i>

221
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:05,888
Jonathan

222
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:11,769
<i>End of message.
You have no messages.</i>

223
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:16,774
<i>You have no messages.</i>

224
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:22,029
<i>You have no messages.</i>

225
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:03,529
Oh! Please, come. How nice.

226
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,074
Hello.
Hi.

227
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,994
Look... I was just about
to finish with someone.

228
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:12,997
I can come back.
No, it won't take long.

229
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:16,292
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.

230
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,502
Thank you.
This is Sarah Tate.

231
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,838
Let me introduce you
to Mr. Rivers.

232
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,300
Sorry, I'm a little...

233
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,927
We've had
a breakthrough today.

234
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,929
It's incredible.

235
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:30,681
It truly is.

236
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,853
This is ridiculous.
Stay awhile.

237
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,105
I should get these
boxes back to the store.

238
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,399
Sarah, there's
no need to hurry.

239
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:42,735
Make yourself
a cup of tea.

240
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:44,903
I suppose. Thank you.

241
00:25:45,904 --> 00:25:47,698
Would you like one?

242
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,200
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

243
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:52,036
Thank you.

244
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:53,537
Mr. Rivers, please.

245
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,920
Oh, excuse me.
Please, sit here. Sit.

246
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:09,470
So, have you heard
of E.V.P., Mr. Rivers?

247
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:11,889
No.

248
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,309
I'm not surprised. Those
that have call us cranks.

249
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:18,896
E.V.P. stands for
electronic voice phenomenon.

250
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,983
I'm listening.
Well.

251
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:26,236
I'm not a clairvoyant,
I'm not a medium,

252
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:30,741
I don't contact the dead,
the dead contact me.

253
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,284
And, With E.V.P.,

254
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:35,204
I can hear them,

255
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:37,498
I can see them,

256
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:40,417
and I can record them.

257
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:03,482
<i>I understand...</i>

258
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,698
<i>...you shouldn't be...</i>

259
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:25,963
And they are...

260
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:27,715
That's right.

261
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,551
People that have passed over.

262
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:49,319
Is this your job,
or a hobby, or what?

263
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,456
I think obsession would be

264
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,041
more appropriate,
to be honest.

265
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,968
Now, I wonder where...

266
00:27:56,051 --> 00:28:00,748
Here we are. They don't always
appear visually the first few times.

267
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:03,167
We tend only to
pick up their voices

268
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,586
and people can
find that frustrating.

269
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:06,920
But when it works,

270
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:09,965
and you see
the faces of the people

271
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,426
that you're able
to help, like Sarah,

272
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:17,097
nothing, believe me,
nothing comes close.

273
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:22,770
Mr. Rivers, do you
want to hear your wife?

274
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:35,199
Yes.

275
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,712
Jonathan

276
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:57,179
<i>Jonathan.</i>

277
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,556
<i>Find him.</i>

278
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:05,896
<i>Jonathan Rivers. Find him.</i>

279
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:10,984
<i>Jonathan.</i>

280
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:13,487
<i>Jonathan Rivers.</i>

281
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,114
<i>Find him, please.</i>

282
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:40,564
The frustrating thing about E.V.P.
is it's not live.

283
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,157
You need to make the recording

284
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,228
and you'll only know if you've got
results when you play it back.

285
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:49,022
Here. It has milk.

286
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,440
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:51,859
Excuse me for a moment.

288
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,573
It's an amazing
feeling, isn't it?

289
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,870
It's indescribable.

290
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:05,742
It took a few visits to get
used to it, but it's addictive.

291
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:09,501
I'm here all the time.
He's really helped me.

292
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,923
I try to help him when I can, so I
keep some of this stuff at the store.

293
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,383
What store?

294
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:17,885
I have a bookstore.

295
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:24,892
Your wife was a wonderful
writer, Mr. Rivers.

296
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,187
Yeah.

297
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,944
So what made you come here?
My fiance.

298
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,906
He died eight months ago.
We've had trouble

299
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:41,074
deciphering
what he's been saying,

300
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:43,118
but this afternoon
we cracked it.

301
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:46,538
Only two words,
"Sarah, yes."

302
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,917
Because, before he died,
he promised me

303
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,127
that if it was
like they say it is

304
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,713
that he would find
a way of getting to me

305
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,341
and letting me know
that he's happy.

306
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,637
So, "Sarah, yes."

307
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,431
Oh.

308
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:09,686
Raymond thinks
we probably won't

309
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:11,488
see him again now,
but that's okay.

310
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,610
And I've heard
what I wanted to hear.

311
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,068
Anna...

312
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:01,822
This is John.

313
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:09,162
If there's any way
you can hear me,

314
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,125
will you please let me know?

315
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:17,004
Please.

316
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:19,715
Just any kind of...
Just any kind of sign.

317
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,218
Please.

318
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:22,611
Susie.

319
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,075
<i>Susie.</i>

320
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:37,584
<i>Susie, I...</i>

321
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:58,480
I recorded this
a few hours ago.

322
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:01,399
It's quite faint, so I
had to save it as a sound

323
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:04,236
file on the computer
to enhance the sound.

324
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,114
So...

325
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,282
She knows that I visited?

326
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,784
I believe so.

327
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,537
So will I get to see
her this time? No.

328
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,288
This will just be sound.

329
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:18,750
I'm sorry, John, we have
to be a little patient.

330
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:23,630
Trust me, John, this is just
the beginning. Sit, here.

331
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,382
Now...

332
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,719
If you want to hear it again,
just press that key.

333
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:31,005
I'll be back in a moment.

334
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,404
<i>Tell him
because I love him.</i>

335
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:56,204
<i>Tell him because I love him.</i>

336
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,358
<i>Bastard. Bastard.</i>

337
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:28,653
<i>Bastard.</i>

338
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:39,456
What was that?
It's okay, it's okay.

339
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,835
We do have some very
bad people out there.

340
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,837
You just have to press that

341
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,673
and they're all gone.

342
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:51,509
We've had a step towards
visual contact with Anna.

343
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:53,303
Let's celebrate that.

344
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,555
Here.

345
00:35:57,474 --> 00:36:01,061
They can't all be nice,
they can't all be Anna.

346
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:32,217
<i>Susie Tomlinson, smile.</i>

347
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,346
<i>Susie Tomlinson...</i>

348
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,484
Hello?

349
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:51,152
<i>It's Raymond.
Something's happening.</i>

350
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:52,946
Really?
Get over here.

351
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,406
I'm on my way.

352
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,242
Hello?

353
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:46,249
Raymond?

354
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:56,277
So you'll tell me
whatever you find out?

355
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:59,489
I can't tell you any more than
you'll read in the papers.

356
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:03,743
But if you can think of
anything else, here, call me.

357
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:05,745
Yeah, thanks.

358
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,016
Thank you for
coming to the service.

359
00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:29,018
It would've
meant a lot to him.

360
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,688
Thank you for
doing this for me.

361
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:36,901
I'm not sure where to start. He
was working off a disk, so...

362
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:39,774
Maybe Anna's original tapes
might be in one of these boxes.

363
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:41,990
You all right?

364
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,201
I still can't
believe he's gone.

365
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:49,122
Well...

366
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,249
Maybe he'll be in touch.

367
00:39:51,374 --> 00:39:52,834
I don't know.

368
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,754
Said he'd made enough of a nuisance
of himself while he was alive.

369
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,592
Just doesn't make any sense.
He was helping people.

370
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,386
Wow. These go back years.

371
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,221
Twenty-three, to be precise.

372
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:07,599
"Carol should know.

373
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:11,811
"Tell Thomas he should.

374
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,731
"Men in the room."

375
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:18,526
Here's one,
"$500 still there."

376
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:20,904
That's the kind of message I like.
Yeah.

377
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:09,786
There we go.

378
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,704
Why do we got so many?

379
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:12,997
So you can watch
your favorite show

380
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:14,661
and I can watch
my favorite show.

381
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:20,213
Yeah.

382
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:02,523
Okay...

383
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:05,401
They're showing
me something.

384
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:07,195
It's...

385
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:11,908
It's...

386
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:16,245
Willow Avenue. They're showing
me Willow Avenue. Yes?

387
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:21,584
No. No. No.

388
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:26,589
Okay, it's no problem.
Sometimes it happens.

389
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:38,935
Your wife, she passed
over recently.

390
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:42,438
Yeah.

391
00:43:44,107 --> 00:43:46,109
Her passing was difficult.

392
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:49,946
Yeah.

393
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,614
She was...

394
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:55,451
She's a writer.
She was a writer.

395
00:43:56,953 --> 00:43:59,163
Yeah, her words
are important.

396
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:07,755
I'm sorry, the light
is way too bright.

397
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:13,094
It's like these tiny,
noisy, little pinpoints.

398
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:16,222
It's making it hard
to see anything at all.

399
00:44:30,153 --> 00:44:31,320
It's electronic voice...

400
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:32,822
I know what this is.

401
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,741
I've been making tapes...
You shouldn't.

402
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,682
You shouldn't try this by
yourself, it's not safe.

403
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,665
It's like
homemade Ouija boards

404
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,834
and teenage
seances at Halloween.

405
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,253
E.V.P. is not good.

406
00:44:47,503 --> 00:44:51,507
We spend years developing our
relationships with our guides

407
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:53,009
so that we can protect you.

408
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:56,012
From what?

409
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:57,388
The ones who like damage.

410
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:01,851
'Cause they are out there
and they will find you.

411
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:05,229
If you're gonna keep
insisting on meddling, then...

412
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:07,523
Anna, my wife,
she sent me a sign.

413
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:10,735
No. No. Not Anna.
You are misreading everything.

414
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:14,781
Listen, it is one thing to contact
the dead, it is another to meddle,

415
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:17,200
and you are meddling.

416
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:25,283
I just came because
I wanted some help.

417
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,084
I know, I can help you.

418
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:31,088
It's just that they are urging
me to tell you to stop.

419
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:33,049
Right. Thank you.

420
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:36,719
Mr. Rivers...

421
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:42,058
Willow Avenue. Are you sure? They
keep showing me Willow Avenue.

422
00:45:42,558 --> 00:45:43,893
No.

423
00:45:44,143 --> 00:45:48,943
No Willow Avenue, no Willow
Street, no Willow Terrace.

424
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:55,571
Mr. Rivers.
She was pregnant. Yes?

425
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:48,374
<i>We play every day.</i>

426
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:20,281
<i>He says
you are happier now.</i>

427
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,367
<i>Did I die?</i>

428
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:28,372
Susie.

429
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,043
<i>Susie Tomlinson...</i>

430
00:47:34,962 --> 00:47:36,964
<i>Smile.</i>

431
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:41,719
<i>Susie Tomlinson.</i>

432
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:45,389
<i>Smile.</i>

433
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:23,344
Excuse me.
Are you Susie Tomlinson?

434
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:25,429
Yeah. My name's Jonathan Rivers.

435
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:27,223
Hi.
May I speak to you?

436
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,862
My mother died
giving birth to me.

437
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:47,243
And my grandmother, she tried for
years to make contact with her.

438
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:50,663
You know, with candles,
darkness and smoke...

439
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:53,165
Seances?
Yeah.

440
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:55,084
All of that,
she tried everything.

441
00:48:58,754 --> 00:49:00,756
She used to tell me

442
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:05,641
that when she died she'd let
me know if she found her,

443
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,348
if she found my mother.

444
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:16,605
Whenever I was sad,
she nagged me to cheer up.

445
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:21,489
She would say, "Susie Tomlinson,
look on the brighter side.

446
00:49:22,236 --> 00:49:23,863
"Susie Tomlinson, lighten up.

447
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:27,283
"Susie Tomlinson, smile."

448
00:49:32,788 --> 00:49:34,790
They've found each other.

449
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,460
Haven't they?

450
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:44,216
That's what she
wanted me to know.

451
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:06,989
It's like she
didn't really die.

452
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:09,658
I get the call from my
father and then, what,

453
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:12,161
like two days
later you come by?

454
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,997
It's like she just
carried straight on.

455
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,793
Susie, I don't understand.

456
00:50:19,335 --> 00:50:22,172
I've been getting messages from
your grandmother for a week.

457
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:26,175
No, that can't be. She just
passed away two days ago.

458
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,697
<i>They are ruling
nothing out in the case</i>

459
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:51,117
<i>of missing mother
of two, Mary Freeman.</i>

460
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,619
<i>It's been nine days
since she left her house...</i>

461
00:51:17,893 --> 00:51:19,937
Where are we gonna eat now?
On our laps.

462
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:37,454
There you go. It works.

463
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:39,081
What's that, Dad?

464
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,586
That means it's time for us to
go pack up your gear. Come on.

465
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:46,714
One, two, three.
That's it.

466
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:52,178
Next week, can I watch a video and
you watch a video like you said?

467
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:54,555
Yep, but only if
you're good and ready

468
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,932
for when your mom
comes to pick you up.

469
00:51:57,016 --> 00:51:58,225
Okay.

470
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:03,272
Daddy.
Yeah.

471
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:05,733
Are you gonna be okay?

472
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:17,411
Yeah.

473
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:25,294
I promise.

474
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:08,003
John.

475
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:12,633
<i>John.</i>

476
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:20,182
<i>John, my love.</i>

477
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:31,360
<i>John. John.</i>

478
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:41,745
Anna.

479
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:45,457
Anna, baby.

480
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,293
<i>John, my love.</i>

481
00:54:11,692 --> 00:54:13,277
Please, get my...

482
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:15,404
<i>Please...</i>

483
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:46,518
<i>John.</i>

484
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:50,105
<i>John.</i>

485
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,527
Go.

486
00:54:56,528 --> 00:54:57,613
<i>Please!</i>

487
00:54:57,738 --> 00:54:58,822
<i>I know.</i>

488
00:55:21,637 --> 00:55:23,972
<i>John, my love.</i>

489
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:27,976
<i>Go.</i>

490
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:36,068
<i>John, my love.</i>

491
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:37,986
<i>Willow Avenue.</i>

492
00:55:39,738 --> 00:55:41,156
Go.

493
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:42,908
<i>Go.</i>

494
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:46,829
<i>Go now.</i>

495
00:55:49,665 --> 00:55:50,749
<i>Please, John.</i>

496
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:52,000
<i>Willow Avenue.</i>

497
00:55:53,544 --> 00:55:55,379
<i>Please, John.</i>

498
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:57,297
<i>Willow Avenue.</i>

499
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:51,578
Please! Please, get my baby!

500
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,455
Please.

501
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,708
Get my baby. Please.

502
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:01,129
Please.

503
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:27,966
Hi.
Hi.

504
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:31,094
Thank you for coming.
Yeah, sure.

505
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:32,220
How's he doing?

506
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,725
He's good. Gets
a little better every day.

507
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:39,936
How are you?

508
00:59:45,901 --> 00:59:47,778
I should...

509
00:59:47,861 --> 00:59:49,946
Sorry. Thanks again.
Yeah. Okay.

510
00:59:53,408 --> 00:59:54,826
Mr. Black.
John...

511
00:59:56,286 --> 00:59:57,412
Mr. Black.

512
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:03,960
This is gonna sound strange,
but I need to tell you.

513
01:00:04,044 --> 01:00:06,672
I went to Willow
Avenue because your wife

514
01:00:06,797 --> 01:00:09,466
reached out to me,
she asked for help.

515
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:11,259
That's the thing.
She wanted help.

516
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:17,099
I am grateful for
what you did, Mr. Rivers.

517
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:20,477
My son wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for you. So thank you.

518
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,146
But now I'd like
you to leave us alone.

519
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,856
Mr. Black...

520
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,193
Carol may have believed
your bullshit, but not me.

521
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:30,153
So you and
your sick friends,

522
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:34,324
you stay the fuck away from me and my family.
You understand?

523
01:00:34,408 --> 01:00:35,742
You stay away.

524
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:50,966
Number one,
they're not dead.

525
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:54,177
When I see them,
they're not dead.

526
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:56,012
She shows me things
that haven't happened.

527
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,390
Things that haven't happened?
Right.

528
01:00:58,473 --> 01:01:00,559
Number two, she's showing
me things that are here,

529
01:01:00,642 --> 01:01:03,478
not somewhere else
where I can't do anything.

530
01:01:03,562 --> 01:01:05,856
She doesn't show me
an earthquake in India

531
01:01:05,981 --> 01:01:08,316
or some bomb in
the Middle East,

532
01:01:08,608 --> 01:01:11,570
they're here in this city where
I can maybe do something.

533
01:01:11,903 --> 01:01:15,365
I've seen things that haven't happened yet.
You understand?

534
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:17,826
I can see how you're
putting it together.

535
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:22,539
Putting it... Putting it together?
What do you mean?

536
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,834
She wants me to help.

537
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:50,525
I couldn't help
Carol Black.

538
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:56,031
But I can help them.

539
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:16,927
<i>Jonathan Rivers' office.</i>

540
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:18,804
Karen, cancel
my appointments

541
01:02:18,887 --> 01:02:20,013
for the next few days.

542
01:02:20,138 --> 01:02:21,306
<i>Are you all right?</i>

543
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:23,141
I need a few days.

544
01:02:24,226 --> 01:02:25,352
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

545
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:26,603
Yeah, I will.

546
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:37,823
ll' hurts.

547
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:43,388
<i>Stop.</i>

548
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,639
<i>She's ours.</i>

549
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:58,987
<i>She's ours.</i>

550
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:14,586
<i>John, my love.</i>

551
01:04:15,128 --> 01:04:17,172
<i>Willow Avenue.</i>

552
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,889
<i>Stop, you pig. Willow Avenue.</i>

553
01:04:26,848 --> 01:04:28,767
It's the same voice.

554
01:04:32,854 --> 01:04:36,566
When I was at Raymond's, he
had been receiving messages,

555
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,110
angry, violent messages.

556
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:40,973
Now I'm getting
the same thing, Sarah.

557
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:42,364
But from whom?

558
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:43,823
I don't know.

559
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:52,916
Sarah.

560
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:56,711
Edith Tomlinson, 207.

561
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:02,384
I was getting messages from
Susie Tomlinson's grandmother.

562
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,722
She was trying to reach her
dead daughter, Susie's mother.

563
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:14,771
"Edith Tomlinson. Daughter
died giving birth, tapes 200 to 208."

564
01:05:15,146 --> 01:05:16,356
Susie's grandmother.

565
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:18,942
She was visiting Raymond.

566
01:05:19,067 --> 01:05:20,735
Probably just a coincidence.

567
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:27,367
Look for Carol Black,
the woman in the car.

568
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:31,354
Remember what
her husband said?

569
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:34,635
"My wife might have been into
that shit, but I wasn't."

570
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:45,760
"Carol Black. General
interest, tape number 231

571
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:53,435
Raymond had lists of clients.
You've seen only two.

572
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:56,896
I've seen hundreds of faces. It
could be the same with all of them.

573
01:05:57,022 --> 01:06:00,859
I'm in there, you're in there,
Edith Tomlinson, Carol Black...

574
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:03,028
There's too much else.
It's a coincidence.

575
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:15,623
Mary Freeman.
The missing woman.

576
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,462
She's on my tapes.

577
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:22,922
I've seen her.

578
01:06:23,882 --> 01:06:25,675
She's on my tapes.

579
01:06:32,432 --> 01:06:33,641
First they visit Raymond.

580
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:37,020
Then I see them.

581
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:41,191
Then they die.

582
01:06:48,615 --> 01:06:52,160
What are you doing? If she's
alive, Anna will show her to me.

583
01:06:52,243 --> 01:06:54,454
We don't know that
everyone you see is alive.

584
01:06:54,621 --> 01:06:56,915
Susie's grandmother,
Carol Black.

585
01:06:57,082 --> 01:06:58,833
What about Anna?
Anna's different.

586
01:06:59,084 --> 01:07:00,085
She's helping me.

587
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:02,253
We don't know
what's happening here.

588
01:07:02,378 --> 01:07:03,588
I do.

589
01:07:04,005 --> 01:07:05,882
If Mary Freeman's
on these tapes,

590
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:08,510
she might be alive
and we can save her.

591
01:07:35,453 --> 01:07:37,747
Sarah!
Sarah, come here!

592
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:40,875
Look at this. Come here.

593
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:48,049
Come here. Look at this.

594
01:07:51,302 --> 01:07:52,303
Hear that?

595
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:56,015
That's her.

596
01:07:58,434 --> 01:08:00,061
Oh, my God.

597
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:02,647
She's alive.

598
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:07,402
<i>Go. Go now.</i>

599
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:09,904
Go where, baby?
John...

600
01:08:09,988 --> 01:08:11,114
Anna, go where?

601
01:08:12,157 --> 01:08:15,118
<i>Please, John. Go!</i>

602
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:17,537
Go... Go where, baby?

603
01:08:18,163 --> 01:08:20,039
<i>Go now!
Go where?</i>

604
01:08:29,507 --> 01:08:31,050
Go where?

605
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:38,850
Damn it! She's gonna die.

606
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:40,268
You don't know that.

607
01:08:40,435 --> 01:08:41,769
She's on the tape.

608
01:08:43,313 --> 01:08:46,107
She's on the tape.
She's gonna die.

609
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:53,907
<i>John.</i>

610
01:08:56,576 --> 01:08:57,911
<i>John.</i>

611
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:13,927
<i>It hurts.</i>

612
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:19,974
Oh, my God.

613
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:31,152
Oh, my God.

614
01:10:09,983 --> 01:10:12,735
What if I don't wake up?
You will.

615
01:10:14,237 --> 01:10:15,905
I promise you will.

616
01:10:37,802 --> 01:10:39,387
You will stay with me?

617
01:10:40,555 --> 01:10:42,140
Sure.

618
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:44,726
Sure.

619
01:10:46,394 --> 01:10:48,730
Promise?
Promise.

620
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:53,401
Thank you.

621
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:30,391
Sarah?

622
01:13:45,615 --> 01:13:46,657
God.

623
01:14:49,845 --> 01:14:51,764
That's as much
as we can say right now.

624
01:14:51,847 --> 01:14:55,017
There's a 30, 40% chance
she might pull through.

625
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:57,457
Let's hope she's okay.
Thanks again for your help.

626
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,606
Mr. Rivers.

627
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,614
Neighbors say they
saw you on the balcony

628
01:15:02,692 --> 01:15:04,569
when Miss Tate fell.
Is that true?

629
01:15:04,819 --> 01:15:06,279
I was trying to stop her.

630
01:15:06,404 --> 01:15:07,863
From falling?

631
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:10,491
Well, she was
on the balcony.

632
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:14,078
Any idea why she
was on the balcony?

633
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:16,414
I don't know.
I don't know.

634
01:15:16,497 --> 01:15:18,040
All right.
I'll give you some time,

635
01:15:18,124 --> 01:15:20,048
but we'll need
a full statement from you.

636
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:24,130
Are you heading home soon?

637
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:29,051
I'm not leaving town,
if that's what you mean.

638
01:15:29,427 --> 01:15:31,429
Okay. I may
come by later then.

639
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:48,988
John.

640
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:53,075
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

641
01:15:54,702 --> 01:15:56,454
You're gonna be fine.

642
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,501
It hurts.

643
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:10,635
It hurts.

644
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:32,425
John.

645
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:38,222
<i>Go.</i>

646
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:40,433
<i>Go now, John.</i>

647
01:17:45,646 --> 01:17:46,981
<i>Go.</i>

648
01:17:47,606 --> 01:17:49,483
<i>Go now.</i>

649
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:53,320
<i>Please, John.</i>

650
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:00,619
No.

651
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,567
Mr. Rivers?

652
01:21:02,676 --> 01:21:03,844
Hello.

653
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:06,513
<i>This is John Rivers. I think
I've found Mary Freeman.</i>

654
01:21:06,597 --> 01:21:07,598
Hello.

655
01:21:09,183 --> 01:21:11,685
I'm at pier 16.
Can you hear me, Smits?

656
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:14,229
Damn it.

657
01:24:24,419 --> 01:24:26,380
Oh, my God!

658
01:24:29,258 --> 01:24:30,509
John.

659
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,054
<i>John, my love.</i>

Anna.

662
01:24:56,493 --> 01:24:58,080
Anna, you have
to help me, please.

663
01:24:58,704 --> 01:25:00,080
<i>Go.</i>

664
01:25:00,372 --> 01:25:02,624
Anna, you have to
help me find Mary.

665
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:05,085
<i>Please, John.</i>

666
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,755
<i>Please, John.</i>

<i>Go now.</i>

671
01:27:20,762 --> 01:27:22,014
They talk to me, John.

672
01:27:25,225 --> 01:27:27,019
This was their idea.

673
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:30,689
All their idea.

674
01:27:45,245 --> 01:27:47,205
She was beautiful, John.

675
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:51,501
I brought her to them.

676
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:54,546
They were very
pleased with me.

677
01:27:56,757 --> 01:27:59,834
<i>...Argyle Avenue, suggests she
may have slipped into the river...</i>

678
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,429
<i>Damage to the head,
the break to the arm...</i>

679
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,017
<i>Anna!
This was their idea.</i>

680
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:11,396
You guys Okay?

681
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,571
No!

682
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,283
She's ours!

683
01:28:27,037 --> 01:28:28,038
Men in the room.

684
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,703
Sir?

685
01:30:35,373 --> 01:30:37,375
O God
of grace and glory,

686
01:30:38,585 --> 01:30:42,422
we remember before you this
day our brother Jonathan.

687
01:30:42,964 --> 01:30:46,968
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life

688
01:30:47,052 --> 01:30:49,095
so that in quiet confidence...

689
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:07,716
I'm sorry.

690
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,303
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

691
01:32:16,975 --> 01:32:18,018
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

692
01:32:21,354 --> 01:32:22,522
<i>I'm sorry, Mikey.</i>

693
01:32:26,985 --> 01:32:28,653
Let's go.

694
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:11,029
We commit
the body to the ground.

695
01:33:11,112 --> 01:33:14,407
From earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

696
01:33:14,783 --> 01:33:16,785
dust to dust.

697
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:56,991
<i>Last time I talked to you</i>

698
01:33:57,075 --> 01:33:59,452
<i>You were lonely
and out of place</i>

699
01:34:00,578 --> 01:34:02,997
<i>You were looking down on me</i>

700
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:06,126
<i>Lost out in space</i>

701
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:09,254
<i>Laid underneath the stars</i>

702
01:34:09,337 --> 01:34:11,881
<i>Strung-out and feeling brave</i>

703
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:15,135
<i>Watch the riddles glow</i>

704
01:34:15,427 --> 01:34:17,762
<i>Watch them float away</i>

705
01:34:24,811 --> 01:34:27,313
<i>Down here in the atmosphere</i>

706
01:34:27,397 --> 01:34:30,275
<i>Garbage and city lights</i>

707
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,445
<i>You gonna save
your tired soul</i>

708
01:34:33,528 --> 01:34:36,322
<i>You're gonna save our lives</i>

709
01:34:36,573 --> 01:34:39,075
<i>Turned on the radio</i>

710
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:41,661
<i>To find you on satellite</i>

711
01:34:42,662 --> 01:34:45,457
<i>I'm waiting
for the sky to fall</i>

712
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,084

<i>And all we are</i>

714
01:34:51,171 --> 01:34:53,923
<i>ls all so far</i>

715
01:34:55,675 --> 01:34:58,678
<i>You're falling back to me</i>

716
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:01,890
<i>The star that I can't see</i>

717
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:04,851

719

<i>Hope you remember me</i>

724
01:35:33,129 --> 01:35:36,591
<i>When you're homesick
and need a change</i>

725
01:35:36,716 --> 01:35:39,552
<i>I miss your purple hair</i>

726
01:35:39,761 --> 01:35:42,472

727
01:35:42,722 --> 01:35:45,141

come back some day</i>

728
01:35:45,225 --> 01:35:47,685
<i>On a bed of nails I wait</i>

729
01:35:48,645 --> 01:35:51,981
<i>I'm praying that
you don't burn out</i>

730
01:35:52,232 --> 01:35:54,317
<i>Or fade away</i>

731
01:35:54,442 --> 01:35:56,903
