Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,482
Rachel, let me see.

3
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,651
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

4
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,350
In my garden.

5
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,893
Finders keepers.

6
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,361
Bruce?

7
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,107
Bruce?

8
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,883
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

9
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,002
Did you have dream?

10
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,341
Nightmare.

11
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,183
Worse than this place?

12
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,140
They are going to fight you.

13
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,169
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

14
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,176
Can they kill me before breakfast?

15
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,383
You are in hell, little man.

16
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,454
And I am the devil.

17
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,296
You're not the devil.

18
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,829
You're practice.

19
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,606
Solitary.

20
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,677
- Why?
- For protection.

21
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,711
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

22
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,376
Get in.

23
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,417
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

24
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:50,221
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

25
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:55,399
Actually, there were seven of them.

26
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,866
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

27
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,869
How do you know my name?

28
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,102
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

29
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,611
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

30
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,907
Who are you?

31
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,246
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

32
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,048
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

33
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,815
A man who can offer you a path.

34
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,217
What makes you think I need a path?

35
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,222
Someone like you is only here by choice.

36
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,764
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

37
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,402
...but whatever your original intentions...

38
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,470
...you have become truly lost.

39
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,775
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

40
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,939
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

41
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,348
...and wishes to serve true justice.

42
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,913
The path of the League of Shadows.

43
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,290
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

44
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,659
A vigilante is just a man lost
in the scramble for his own gratification.

45
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,495
He can be destroyed or locked up.

46
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:09,673
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

47
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,811
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

48
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,470
...and if they can't stop you...

49
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,316
...then you become
something else entirely.

50
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,543
Which is?

51
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,024
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

52
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,951
Tomorrow, you will be released.

53
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,528
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

54
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:35,155
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

55
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,029
Pick one of these flowers.

56
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,172
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

57
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,137
...you may find what you were looking for
in the first place.

58
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,142
And what was I looking for?

59
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,814
Only you can know that.

60
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,577
You turn back. You go back.

61
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,212
Ra's al Ghul?

62
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,991
Wait.

63
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,301
What are you seeking?

64
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,231
I seek...

65
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,040
...the means to fight injustice.

66
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,505
To turn fear...

67
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,714
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

68
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,466
To manipulate the fears in others...

69
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,746
...you must first master your own.

70
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,078
Are you ready to begin?

71
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,543
I can... I can barely stand.

72
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,085
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

73
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,383
Death is not considerate or fair!

74
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:24,521
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

75
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,766
Tiger.

76
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,167
Jujitsu.

77
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,432
Panther.

78
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,243
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

79
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,278
And you are afraid.

80
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,089
But not of me.

81
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,054
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

82
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,733
...what do you fear?

83
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,315
Bruce?

84
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,444
It's okay. It's okay.

85
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,112
You'll be okay.

86
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,689
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

87
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,852
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

88
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,258
Very good, sir.

89
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,429
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

90
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,739
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

91
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,168
And why do we fall, Bruce?

92
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,569
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

93
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,215
Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture.

94
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,990
The bats again?

95
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,292
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

96
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,861
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

97
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,005
All creatures feel fear.

98
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,538
Even the scary ones?

99
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,573
Especially the scary ones.

100
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,740
I got something to show you.

101
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:27,348
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

102
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,215
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

103
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,981
No going back to bed.

104
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,320
Did you build this train, Dad?

105
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:42,195
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

106
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,895
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

107
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:50,007
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

108
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,871
And at the center...

109
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,875
...Wayne Tower.

110
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,947
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

111
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,313
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

112
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,351
- Better?
- Well...

113
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,785
...more interested men.

114
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,579
Can we go?

115
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,440
Please.

116
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,077
Okay. Let's go.

117
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,197
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

118
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,460
I just needed some fresh air.

119
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,833
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

120
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,171
Come on. Let's go.

121
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,379
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

122
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,917
- That's fine.
- Fast.

123
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,644
Take it easy.

124
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,879
Take it easy.

125
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,125
Here you go.

126
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,728
It's fine. It's fine.

127
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,727
Now just take it and go.

128
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,699
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

129
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,070
Thomas!

130
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,674
Bruce.

131
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,719
It's okay.

132
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,586
Don't be afraid.

133
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,187
Is this your father's?

134
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
It's okay.

135
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,691
Come here.

136
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,630
There you go.

137
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,766
It's okay.

138
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,411
It's okay.

139
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,907
Gordon.

140
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,585
Hey.

141
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,457
Good news.

142
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,798
We got him, son.

143
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,150
You're in excellent hands.

144
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,153
We'll be watching the empire.

145
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:02,316
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

146
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:21,437
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

147
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,677
- Very well.
- Alfred?

148
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,683
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

149
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,521
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

150
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,721
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

151
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,199
It was him, and him alone.

152
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,170
Do you understand?

153
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,368
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

154
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,512
So do I, Master Bruce.

155
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,177
So do I.

156
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,288
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

157
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,582
My anger outweighs my guilt.

158
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,724
Come.

159
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:15,093
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

160
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,293
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

161
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,766
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

162
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,244
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,613
Invisible?

164
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:43,254
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,937
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,308
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,047
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,551
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,048
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,487
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,894
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,364
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,969
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,074
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,945
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,552
It was your father's.

177
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,279
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,644
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,680
I've had training.

180
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,684
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,516
Will is everything!

182
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,127
The will to act.

183
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,136
Yield.

184
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,841
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,741
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,151
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,524
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,822
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,125
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,598
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,797
That impossible anger strangling the grief,
until the memory of your loved one is just...

192
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,033
...poison in your veins.

193
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:15,669
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

194
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,549
...so you'd be spared your pain.

195
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:25,954
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

196
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,618
Once, I had a wife.

197
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,496
My great love.

198
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,792
She was taken from me.

199
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,165
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

200
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,637
...who must be fought without hesitation,
without pity.

201
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,775
Your anger gives you great power.

202
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:50,806
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

203
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,215
...as it almost did me.

204
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,250
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

205
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,255
That's no help to me.

206
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,288
Why, Bruce?

207
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,121
Why could you not avenge your parents?

208
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,390
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

209
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,231
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

210
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,635
I'm not heading back at all.

211
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,832
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

212
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,041
They just don't feel the same way.

213
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,510
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

214
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,083
My room will be fine.

215
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,777
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

216
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,820
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

217
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,481
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

218
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,560
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

219
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,825
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

220
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,696
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

221
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:49,405
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

222
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,236
...for what was most precious to him...

223
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,641
...in the whole world.

224
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,142
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

225
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,377
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

226
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,990
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

227
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,252
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

228
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,455
Just know that there are those of us
who care about what you do with your future.

229
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,357
Haven't given up on me yet?

230
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,525
Never.

231
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,486
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

232
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,257
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

233
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,150
Old habits die hard, I guess.

234
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,693
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

235
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,763
How's your mom?

236
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,395
She misses this place.

237
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,426
So do I.

238
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,065
Yeah.

239
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,231
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

240
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,434
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

241
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,139
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

242
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,950
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

243
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,749
Someone at this proceeding...

244
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,588
...should stand for my parents.

245
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,890
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

246
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,296
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

247
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,901
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

248
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,736
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

249
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,573
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

250
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,311
I cannot let that pass.

251
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,351
And I need you
to understand that, please.

252
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,316
Okay.

253
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,724
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

254
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:28,093
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was
motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

255
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,997
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

256
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,934
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

257
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,269
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

258
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,575
Mr. Chill?

259
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,810
Your Honor...

260
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,847
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

261
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,723
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

262
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,227
...but that don't change what I did.

263
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,533
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

264
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,970
Has he got anything to say?

265
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,556
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

266
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,566
Bruce Wayne!

267
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,567
Joe! Hey, Joe!

268
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,208
Falcone says hi.

269
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:58,147
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

270
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,448
I do.

271
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,590
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden
insisted on making the hearing public.

272
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,168
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

273
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,632
Maybe I should thank them.

274
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,365
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

275
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,475
My parents deserved justice.

276
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,544
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

277
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,614
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

278
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,344
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about
you making yourself feel better.

279
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,819
- Which is why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

280
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,730
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

281
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,634
This city is rotting.

282
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,566
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

283
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,228
Things are worse than ever here.

284
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,966
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

285
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,077
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

286
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,770
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

287
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,906
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

288
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,357
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

289
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,592
We all know where to find him.

290
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,391
As long as he keeps the bad people rich and
the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

291
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,729
Good people like your parents,
who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

292
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,804
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

293
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,178
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

294
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,645
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

295
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,947
Now I can't.

296
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,396
Your father would be ashamed of you.

297
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,405
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

298
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,715
No gun? I'm insulted.

299
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,756
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

300
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,622
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

301
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,422
Only those who know me, kid.

302
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,232
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

303
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,400
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

304
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,464
...and a judge.

305
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,904
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation
of blowing your head off in front of them.

306
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,806
Now, that's power you can't buy.

307
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,879
That's the power of fear.

308
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,543
I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,616
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

310
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,412
But you haven't thought it through.

311
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,715
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

312
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,324
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

313
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,795
People from your world...

314
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,332
...have so much to lose.

315
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,836
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

316
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,975
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

317
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:40,235
You've never tasted desperate.

318
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,971
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

319
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:46,548
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

320
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,018
So don't come down here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

321
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,282
This is a world you'll never understand.

322
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,483
And you always fear...

323
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,094
...what you don't understand.

324
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,364
All right.

325
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,841
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

326
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,979
More than your old man anyway.

327
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,446
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

328
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,847
He said your father begged for mercy.

329
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,950
Begged.

330
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,522
Like a dog.

331
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,133
Should've tipped better.

332
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,980
- For what?
- Your jacket.

333
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,143
Okay.

334
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,712
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

335
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,984
Be careful who sees you with that.

336
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,494
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

337
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,658
Everyone.

338
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,730
It's...

339
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,870
It's a nice coat.

340
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,558
<i>When you lived among the criminals,</i>
<i>did you start to pity them?</i>

341
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,424
<i>The first time I stole</i>
<i>so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</i>

342
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:45,092
<i>I lost many assumptions about</i>
<i>the simple nature of right and wrong.</i>

343
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,464
<i>And when I traveled...</i>

344
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,336
<i>... I learned the fear before a crime...</i>

345
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,670
<i>... and the thrill of success.</i>

346
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,412
<i>But I never became one of them.</i>

347
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,821
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

348
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,055
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

349
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,221
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

350
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,431
But a criminal is not complicated.

351
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,939
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

352
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,669
You fear your own power.

353
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,107
You fear your anger...

354
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,846
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

355
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,454
Now you must journey inwards.

356
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,318
You are ready.

357
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,728
Breathe.

358
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,173
Breathe.

359
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,011
Breathe in your fears.

360
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,640
Face them.

361
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,951
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

362
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,524
You must bask in the fear of other men.

363
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,397
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

364
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,482
You have to become a terrible thought.

365
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,250
A wraith.

366
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,329
You have to become an idea!

367
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,265
Feel terror cloud your senses.

368
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,207
Feel its power to distort.

369
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,411
To control.

370
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,286
And know that this power can be yours.

371
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,498
Embrace your worst fear.

372
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,776
Become one with the darkness.

373
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,329
Focus.

374
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,797
Concentrate.

375
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,065
Master your senses.

376
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,603
You cannot leave any sign.

377
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,200
I haven't.

378
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,472
Impressive.

379
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,688
We have purged your fear.

380
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,456
You are ready to lead these men.

381
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,158
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

382
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,967
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

383
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,089
No.

384
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,822
I'm no executioner.

385
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,059
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

386
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,697
That's why it's so important.

387
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,698
It separates us from them.

388
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,271
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

389
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,237
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

390
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,104
Corrupt bureaucrats?

391
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,768
Criminals mock society's laws.

392
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,245
You know this better than most.

393
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,710
You cannot lead these men...

394
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,879
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

395
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,924
And where would I be leading
these men?

396
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,722
Gotham.

397
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,954
As Gotham's favored son...

398
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,464
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

399
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:21,601
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

400
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,105
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

401
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,474
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

402
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,242
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

403
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:38,616
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

404
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,983
It is one we've performed for centuries.

405
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,055
Gotham...

406
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,129
...must be destroyed.

407
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,958
You can't believe in this.

408
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:56,697
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

409
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,277
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

410
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,845
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

411
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,576
...but I will not become an executioner.

412
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,310
Bruce, please.

413
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,320
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

414
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,215
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

415
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,755
I will tell him you saved his life.

416
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,041
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

417
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,483
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

418
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,489
Apart from the mud.

419
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,419
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

420
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,822
As long as it takes.

421
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,485
I want to show the people...

422
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,099
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

423
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:50,206
