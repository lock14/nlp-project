1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,919
One day you fall for this boy.

2
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:54,397
And he touches you with his fingers.

3
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,275
And he burns holes in your skin with his mouth.

4
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,873
But it hurts when you look at him.

5
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,831
And it hurts when you don't.

6
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:13,429
And it feels like someone's cut you open
with a jagged piece of glass.

7
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:24,545
The Tracey Fragments

8
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,340
Sonny was a dog...

9
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,859
God! God! God!

10
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,494
It's all about the pussy and the ass today...

11
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:55,133
Fuck you, Fuck you, Fuck you, Fuck you.

12
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,492
I love you, Tracey Berkowitz.

13
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,652
We can take a plane. Take a plane.

14
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,250
-You know...
-We can take a plane.

15
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:04,849
..It really isn't my fault..

16
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,608
I had a car but I fucking smashed it.

17
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,606
...I came from a hole, you know.

18
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:16,004
Raped. Murdered. Is that what you want?

19
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,524
Do we really have to do this now?

20
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:24,001
They can't ever know¡­ Promise me...
No one can...

21
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,999
Why would I lie? Huh? Why would I lie?

22
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:29,639
Promise me... Promise me...

23
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,759
I am so happy......

24
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,358
Why would I lie?

25
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:35,917
Why would I lie?

26
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:46,233
I know what you're doing,
you stupid ugly bitch dyke fuck ass!

27
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:53,710
I kind of like to ride a different bus every night
depending on my mood.

28
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,108
Like, if I'm depressed,
I-I enjoy being around other depressed people.

29
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,507
And happy people
they friggin' depress me, you know.

30
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:08,464
Look. The other day, something happened.

31
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,462
I came to certain realizations.

32
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:16,541
I can't tell you what.

33
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,779
Or you'll end up like me.

34
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,938
On this bus. Looking for someone.

35
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,257
Sonny!

36
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:31,774
Sonny, please!

37
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,814
Sonny!

38
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,212
Sonny!

39
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,971
Sonny.......

40
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,964
My name is Tracey Berkowitz. Fifteen.

41
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,842
Just a normal girl who hates herself.

42
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:47,785
No, no, no...

43
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:50,744
Settle down. Just settle down.

44
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:56,182
Tracey, where exactly did you find the toque?

45
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,620
I just found it.

46
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
There's something you're not telling us.

47
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,379
Tracey is there anything you're not telling us?

48
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:11,855
I'm a very passionate person.
I was born to love.

49
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:16,094
-Mis-Mister Berkowitz-
-No, where is he!?! Where is he!?!

50
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:18,493
-Settle down.
-Where's my son!?!

51
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,565
I wish I just had one of those whistles.

52
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,323
Because he'd be here right now.

53
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,802
On the side of the road, barking.

54
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,881
It's not my fault.

55
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:53,359
Because if you knew them
-- if you really knew them --

56
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:57,757
you would know that
I'm not the one that needs a friggin' shrink.

57
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:02,236
Look. Look at what you've done to Mommy?
She's destroyed.

58
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:06,714
-We've got a fucking crisis here.
-Everything's a fucking crisis.

59
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,753
Shut up!

60
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,907
Why don't you join us?

61
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,142
I don't know what you...

62
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:37,222
We looked for Sonny for two days.

63
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,140
He never came back.

64
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,738
Sonny...Sonny...

65
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:51,296
I gotta find him. I gotta find him.
No body can stop me.

66
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:45,292
Have you seen my brother Sonny?

67
00:08:54,528 --> 00:09:03,764
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

68
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:31,073
Okay sweetie, see you later.

69
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,392
Okay? See you. Okay?

70
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,827
Sonny? Sonny! Sonny.

71
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:50,945
Stop. Please, please.

72
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:54,464
Please stop, it's an emergency, please.

73
00:09:54,145 --> 00:10:01,182
Sonny! Sonny! Sonny! Sonny...!

74
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:23,013
Excuse me, I'm looking for my brother.

75
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,012
Hello?

76
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:32,009
Sonny? He's nine. Blue coat.
I-I just saw him - I just saw him outside.

77
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:03,197
Mark Johnson is my friend. He's a very nice guy.

78
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:06,475
I know what people say about Mark Johnson,

79
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,035
but he's a regular guy.

80
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,273
And he likes you.

81
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,313
It doesn't have to be a heavy trip.

82
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,352
He just wants to be your friend.

83
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:22,510
Take you out for dinner,
maybe some drinks, something......

84
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:27,187
Fuck off.

85
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,746
Fuck off!

86
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,984
Nice.

87
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,302
Well, look who it is: it's the tit-less wonder.

88
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:44,261
Whoops.
Awww, sorry about that.
Whooops.

89
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:47,619
That floor must be really hard.
That is tragic.

90
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,459
See you later. Have a nice day.

91
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:05,732
Now class, does anyone know
what Its tits look like?

92
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,291
Anybody? Here, allow me. Ready?

93
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,448
Voila. Isn't that...? That's...

94
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:21,926
This is the story of the girl with no tits.

95
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:28,723
Went to my school. No tits. Big dumb moon face.

96
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,759
Hey. Here you go.

97
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:51,515
It. It. It. It...

98
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,593
Shut the fuck up.

99
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:54,913
What's going on?

100
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:58,272
What is that piece of paper? Bring it to me!

101
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,467
Throw it out.

102
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,725
Before I left home,

103
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,683
I had this idea.

104
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:16,281
I was going to start this metal-core band
with my boyfriend, Billy Zero.

105
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,399
My boyfriend is so gorgeous.

106
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,278
And famous.

107
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,397
Okay,

108
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,596
Billy Zero isn't exactly famous.

109
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:35,473
But he's a star to me, okay?
He is like the most gorgeous boy I have ever seen.

110
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:39,872
Anywhere. In any music video.
In the whole world, okay?

111
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,591
Oh, he wanted to touch me.

112
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:46,349
He stuck his cock in me and said I love you.

113
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,148
In that exact order.

114
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,866
Now I'm not afraid to die

115
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:58,304
because, like, birds and bees and bugs?

116
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,583
They all die after they fuck.

117
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,821
I love you, Tracey Berkowitz.

118
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:21,256
It. It. It. It. It...

119
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,534
It's the "Girl With No Tits"

120
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:33,691
Don't worry about it. You're a late developer.

121
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,090
It's natural.

122
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,209
Exhibit A. My father.

123
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:41,088
He had sex with my mom to make me but, you know,

124
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:45,126
I-I think he, like, freakin' fell on her or something

125
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,765
because he says that we're both accidents.

126
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,804
Anyway, like I was saying, I trade futures.

127
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,923
Anyone asks you, that's what you tell them.

128
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:55,722
Don't cry for Daddy.
He was never very good at stocks and bonds.

129
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,440
Daddy missed the boat. Daddy missed the boat.
Daddy missed the boat.

130
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,560
Exhibit B. My mother.

131
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,599
She's too busy to talk to me.

132
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,918
She smokes three packs a day.

133
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:09,237
And getting her away from the TV
is a surgical procedure.

134
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:12,435
So Daddy missed the boat, didn't he?

135
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,635
Ha. Ha.

136
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,634
You're the only one laughing.

137
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,992
Exhibit C. Sonny,

138
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,992
who I turned into a dog.

139
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,029
Why is he barking?

140
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:33,826
If somebody doesn't tell me
why my son is barking, everybody is grounded.

141
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,344
I, uh,

142
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,303
I hypnotized him.

143
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,742
I'm holding you personally responsible.

144
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:47,782
You know what, that is it.

145
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:53,579
That's the final piece of evidence that
we need to send you to a psychiatrist.

146
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:58,497
Are you on drugs?

147
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,576
No, of course not.

148
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,096
What do you mean, of course not?

149
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:05,254
W-w-what are you saying?
You don't believe me or something?

150
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:08,853
Tracey, my philosophy is to be brutally honest
with my patients,

151
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:13,611
even - and especially - my adolescent patients.
As a way to build trust.

152
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,931
I want you to trust me, Tracey.

153
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,369
Because I care about you.

154
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,048
Do you understand?

155
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,285
Your parents are concerned.

156
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:32,164
Your attitude is histrionic, delusional with
tendencies towards Borderline personality disorder.

157
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:37,682
-Borderline personality disorder. What the...?
-They think you're smoking crack.

158
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,681
My parents are lying. That's...

159
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,640
Come on, Tracey.

160
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,440
There's no reason for your parents to lie,
is there?

161
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,158
-How do I know what motives my parents?
-Tracey, as your psychiatrist,

162
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:48,878
I am of the opinion that
you might think you want to get better,

163
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:51,716
but you don't really want to get better.

164
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,795
No, no, no. I do, I do, I want to get better.

165
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:58,354
-Then why are you resisting me?
-No, no, I'm not, I'm not resisting you.

166
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,792
-You're doing it right now.
-Well then tell me what to do.

167
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,032
I can't do that.

168
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:05,231
Well then how am I supposed to stop resisting you?

169
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,710
I can't tell you that.

170
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,350
Well I can't have this conversation anymore.

171
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,108
-"Can't" is a choice.
-Okay, okay.

172
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,346
Am I resisting you now?

173
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:20,625
Are you?

174
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:25,183
Dr. Heker. My psychiatrist.

175
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:27,942
She only cares about the, like,
eighty bucks an hour she paid,

176
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,541
or whatever, to prevent me from
turning into a psycho.

177
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,658
Well, it's kind of too late for that.

178
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:49,573
When things happen to people,
they radiate a light.

179
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:53,212
Because they've got a picture caught inside them.

180
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:57,171
Because they were there and you weren't.

181
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,929
And because you've only got a piece

182
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:06,967
and because all you can do is shrink
and blow up that one tiny piece.

183
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,179
My name is Estuary Palomino.

184
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,538
That's my stage name.

185
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:25,216
Palomino is the color of the city where I'm from.

186
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:29,974
My name is Tracey Berkowitz.

187
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,373
Tracey Zero-witz.

188
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:37,491
Forty below Zero-witz.

189
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:25,312
What the fuck was that?

190
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,591
You warm enough?

191
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm okay.

192
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,309
'Cause there's going to be a blizzard.

193
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,429
I'm fine.

194
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:38,746
See, I'm looking for my, uh,
my younger brother, Sonny. He's nine.

195
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:43,425
-Sonny...nine? Yeah I know him.
I'll give you a ride.
-You know Sonny?

196
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,264
Yeah. I mean, I've seen him around.
I'll give you a ride.

197
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:58,059
Hey what's your name?

198
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,099
Tracey.

199
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:05,496
I'm Lance. From Toronto.

200
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,055
Cool.

201
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:30,646
Looking good.

202
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,562
Where's Sonny? I-I-I don't see Sonny.

203
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,757
You know a joint's high class when they've got entertainment.

204
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:58,715
-Hey. Hey.
-What the fuck are you lookin' at?

205
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:01,114
I'm going to stand on my head.

206
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:05,233
Because you're so beautiful.

207
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:08,192
You'd better be joking.

208
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:19,147
Fuck you.

209
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:24,705
Fuck you. We're just having a little fun.

210
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,024
I don't give a fuck.

211
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:31,223
I'm going to break your mouth so it's lying
on the fucking floor.Fuckin' cockroach.

212
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:38,180
-What do you want?
-I, um, a Cinzano.

213
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,299
-We only have beer. How many?
-One.

214
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:49,855
-Two bucks.
-He's paying. That guy. Right there.

215
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:14,525
What are you still doing here?

216
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,765
I want to.....

217
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:24,802
-You want to what?
-Stay, I guess.

218
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:28,999
It really isn't my fault.
I absolutely had to run away.

219
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah.

220
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,879
Like my dad, he's...he's always saying

221
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,637
that I exaggerate, you know.

222
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:40,075
He's always like, "Tracey, I don't know
what to believe and what not to believe."

223
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,354
I'm so fucking cold. I'm fucking...

224
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:43,514
Sonny...?

225
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:49,271
But how do you know what's real and what's not
when the whole life is inside your head?

226
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,831
We got a whole night at home.

227
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,230
Sonny...

228
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,428
We got more. We got more than we need to, okay?

229
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,387
Thanks a lot, man. Have a nice evening.

230
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,843
Tracy Berkowitz.

231
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,442
Tracey Zero-witz.

232
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,562
Forty below Zero-witz...

233
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:14,078
Below Zero-witz. Forty below Zero-witz.
Forty below Zero-witz...

234
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:29,872
Check this out. Tracey Berkowitz.
Billy Zero. And Teenage Pussy.

235
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,871
My friends, we've got a brand new holy trinity here.

236
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,348
Ahem. Excuse me.

237
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:40,868
What?

238
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:41,947
I'm a customer.

239
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:44,386
If you buy something.

240
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,103
You know what actually?

241
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:54,742
I don't want to spend my money here anymore.

242
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:58,141
Because I have a boyfriend.

243
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,020
Not some convenience store loser.

244
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:10,736
How come beauty burns everything away so the rest of the whole world,

245
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:14,015
even me, disappears?

246
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:18,812
Yeah, well, he's going to be mince meat
by the time I get through with him.

247
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:21,492
Go easy on him Debbie. He's new.

248
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:23,251
Oh, he is not new.

249
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:25,130
Where'd you get that top, Debbie?

250
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,930
Haney mall, bitches.

251
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:30,568
What you looking at, fag?

252
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:32,687
Okay, everyone: hold the show.

253
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,047
Is that a he or is that a she?

254
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,245
I don't know. But it got no tits.

255
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,644
Tits are crucial, okay?

256
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:43,003
Like, at our school,
girls wear them around like medals.

257
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:47,082
You know, they all walk around
with their chests out all over school.

258
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:51,960
These big fat tits just floating around...

259
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,279
Get the fuck out.

260
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,838
...separate from the girls who wear them.

261
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,556
I love you, Tracey Berkowitz.

262
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:10,313
He said it, like, a million trillion times.

263
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:13,952
And he bought me presents.

264
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,310
Like this necklace, you know?

265
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,748
It's, like, made of titanium.

266
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:25,107
A million carats or what... it was really expensive.

267
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,143
Must've gotten lost.

268
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,299
Men buy girls panties,

269
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,418
Myra Bernie told me.

270
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:49,537
Girls in school like me,

271
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:50,977
unpopular girls,

272
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:57,054
girls with big tits, girls with regular tits,
and girls with no tits at all -

273
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,333
the men don't even care.

274
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,492
The panties just come out of a machine
like a chocolate bar.

275
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,890
The men take them home
and cuddle them like a little kitten.

276
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,610
She told me.

277
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,329
Myra Bernie.

278
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:15,048
Because her parents heard it at a party.

279
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:18,806
I don't care - I don't even like panties.

280
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:22,445
The word sickens me.

281
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,379
You're in my class, right?

282
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:29,457
Do we have a test today or whatever?

283
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:44,692
Okay, what the fuck is this?

284
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:50,930
No. See this does not work for me here,
alright? Its?

285
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,488
Where'd you get that, It? Huh?
Where'd you get that?

286
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:57,447
Nice try --trying to dress like us,
but it doesn't work, Its. Its. Its.

287
00:30:57,447 --> 00:31:01,405
God! God! God! Arghhhh...

288
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:04,684
Raped. Murdered. Is that what you want?

289
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:06,763
Yeah.

290
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:08,522
Yeah what?

291
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:10,001
Yeah to rape. Yeah to murder.

292
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,121
What kind of psychiatrist is she going to?

293
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,520
That's it, you're grounded. One month.

294
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,639
Oh, come on.

295
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,879
-That's not fair.
-Who says life's fair?

296
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,318
It wouldn't kill you to stay inside.

297
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:23,316
Yeah. Yeah, it would actually.

298
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,477
What do we do with her?

299
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:26,955
Look what you're doing to Mommy.

300
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:29,394
Two months. Grounded.

301
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,874
Come on, that's ridiculous.
You can't just do that.

302
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:32,833
We just did it.

303
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,791
Do you remember in the news
when two retards had a kid?

304
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,951
Well, that was me.

305
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,230
Just kidding.

306
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:44,389
You know, you've got a lot of work to do.

307
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:45,188
Wh-what?

308
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:49,146
Is that the kind of crap your
psychiatrist is teaching you?

309
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,306
I want you to phone that bitch. That is over.

310
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:54,184
We're not paying for that shit anymore.

311
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,183
We don't even pay for it.

312
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:59,023
-The frickin' government pays for it.
-That's it.

313
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:03,101
Three months. Grounded.

314
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,620
Yeah. Go watch your brother.

315
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,297
They never should've grounded me.

316
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,376
Now I have nothing.

317
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:21,973
Oh, fucking hell. Look at the crow.

318
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:24,172
Oh.

319
00:32:26,732 --> 00:32:28,011
I'm gonna get him.

320
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,370
Don't touch it.

321
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,169
Shhh.

322
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:37,647
I can't stop this burning in my eyes.

323
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,645
And I-I can't stop this burning under my skin.

324
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:53,042
'Cause ever since I saw him everything
became this fiery blur that I can't put out.
You put a smell on it , it's going to be a freak.

325
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,680
Ah fuck, and all the other crows are going to kill it.

326
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
Okay, nobody's killing nobody.

327
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,439
Fuck you.

328
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,839
Leave me alone you horn dog.

329
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,797
-Fuck off, don't fucking touch me.
-Come on. Alright.

330
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:04,916
Don't fucking...
Fuck off. Don't fucking touch me...

331
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,876
Yeah, fuck you. Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:09,555
Hey, hey, hey.

333
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:12,393
Don't touch me. He's got my money.

334
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:13,873
He's got my money.

335
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:15,513
Don't fucking touch me.

336
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:19,151
He's got my fucking money. He's got my money.

337
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:22,190
-She didn't do anything...
-I've had a long day.

338
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,068
-It's this dirtbag...
-You know whay, man, go with her.

339
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:27,588
-She didn't even do anything...
-I'm just trying to help you out, man.

340
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,507
She didn't do anything.

341
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:30,706
Are you okay?

342
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:35,825
He took my money, man. He took my fucking money.

343
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:49,779
Thank you. Thank you.

344
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:54,857
I love you. Thank you. Thank you.

345
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:58,135
No, no, no, look. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, man.

346
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:03,414
Thank you so... I love you, man,
I love you thank you, thank you man......

347
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:09,371
Thank you! yes! Thank you......

348
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:13,209
When a horse falls, foam comes out of its mouth.

349
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:21,727
When it falls, the legs of the horse thrash
and the horse is no good, so somebody shoots it.

350
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,605
The horse turns into glue.

351
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:28,244
A machine puts the glue into bottles

352
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:34,442
and children squeeze the bottles to get
the glue out and stick bits of paper on to cards.

353
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:37,840
Glue gets on the children's hands

354
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,519
and the children eat the glue

355
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,198
and the children become the horse.

356
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:50,995
(...and her shitty mother.
Hmm, I betcha think it's pretty funny. )

357
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:56,073
(Yeah, betcha think it's really funny.)

358
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:58,512
(Betcha think it's funny. )

359
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,591
(Huh? Think it's funny? )

360
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,589
(God damn son of a - God damn...)

361
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:15,745
Sonny once had a mother

362
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:19,743
who loved him very much.

363
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,583
Where was his father?

364
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:24,862
That's not the point.

365
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,498
I went out with wild Eskimo hunters.

366
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,938
Shot a dog.

367
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:38,176
Did the dog die?

368
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,174
It died.

369
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:48,692
The mother of the baby died.

370
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,170
We rolled her over.

371
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,888
Found a baby underneath her body.

372
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,727
A baby?

373
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,046
A baby.

374
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,484
We didn't want to kill the baby,

375
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:14,602
so we-we strapped him onto the-

376
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,640
the bobsled and......

377
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,919
brought him home

378
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,476
to live with us.

379
00:36:32,075 --> 00:36:34,514
Goodnight, sweetheart.

380
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,829
Sonny!

381
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,388
Sonny!

382
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:52,067
Sonny!

383
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,386
Sonny, wait!

384
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,625
Sonny......

385
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,559
Myra Bernie told me

386
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,478
if you swallow a boy's come

387
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,957
then a piece of the boy gets stuck inside of you.

388
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:13,076
And, if he's, like, totally smart,
then you get smarter.

389
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:19,073
And if he's dumb, well, nothing really changes.

390
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,815
What is that?

391
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,054
Sonny.

392
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,612
Where'd you get that necklace?

393
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,731
Where did you get that necklace?

394
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,971
Thank you.

395
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:18,049
Sonny!

396
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,359
I don't like the country.

397
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,478
Creeps me out.

398
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:54,676
In the country, dead bodies
live in swamps and ditches and shallow graves.

399
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,954
A man dumps the body of a girl in a ditch.

400
00:39:57,954 --> 00:40:01,713
The body rots, melts into slime.

401
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:04,311
Flowers pop up where the body lies,

402
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,631
seeds fly out of the flowers,

403
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:12,268
and the bee sucks the flowers and makes honey.

404
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:18,546
And then the family of the girl
buys the honey from the store.

405
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,423
And the family eats the girl.

406
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:22,281
This is not some kind of, like, abuse story, okay?

407
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,400
I don't cry over spilt milk, you know?

408
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,478
I- I can't even drink milk
because I'm lactose intolerant.

409
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:33,236
I should've run away.
Like, forty gadrillion years ago,

410
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:37,075
but I wasn't abused.

411
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:46,911
Mom?

412
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:52,829
Mom?

413
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:03,065
Mom?

414
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:13,061
Mom!

415
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,298
Fuck!

416
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:02,601
The blizzard's coming.

417
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:07,199
I know and... can't I go outside for,
like a second?

418
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,998
-I need to relax.
-You're grounded.

419
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:15,076
-What am I supposed to do?
-You're going to lock that door
and watch your brother.

420
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:16,915
I might as well kill myself so I can fucking rest.

421
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:20,914
Hey! Mommy and I love you. Don't you know that?

422
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:24,353
We don't want you to go outside
because the blizzard's coming

423
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:27,392
and grounded is grounded.

424
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:30,630
Now promise us you'll stay inside.

425
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,789
Yeah, okay, I promise.

426
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:38,188
I'm just going to lock the door.

427
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:45,345
The door locked?

428
00:43:45,345 --> 00:43:49,183
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm just locking it.
-Good girl.

429
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,954
Do you live in a condominium?

430
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,353
I live in a house.

431
00:46:48,353 --> 00:46:51,751
How many people live in your house?
You know 'cause I was thinking.

432
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,630
Maybe I could rent a room.

433
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,509
You know, and then, when they find Sonny,
we-we can come live with you.

434
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:59,708
Tracey, you can't come home with me.

435
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:02,627
Why not?

436
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:05,026
Well, for one thing there are rules.

437
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:07,624
I'm not... I'm not going go tell on anybody.

438
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:10,624
Why don't you go home?

439
00:47:12,023 --> 00:47:13,902
Go home.

440
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:16,941
Talk to your family.

441
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:19,980
Contrary to what you believe,

442
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:23,899
your feelings will be beneficial to your parents.

443
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,977
They need to know what you're feeling.

444
00:47:28,536 --> 00:47:29,537
Fuck that!

445
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:30,976
What did you say?

446
00:47:32,055 --> 00:47:34,254
Nothing.

447
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:40,891
I am just...I'm really worried

448
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,131
that I'm going insane.

449
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:45,570
Well, if you're worried,

450
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,889
go to the hospital.

451
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:50,248
Where they put the nut bars?
Where they put the nut bars?

452
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,368
What was that?

453
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:54,846
Nothing. Nothing. That was...

454
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:58,205
just kidding, you know. Just joking.

455
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:02,643
It's okay the express your anger.

456
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,681
What do you know about anger, you cunt!?!

457
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:11,960
You fucking, stupid, robot cunt.

458
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:18,317
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

459
00:48:18,677 --> 00:48:22,115
No, I'm really, really, really, really, really sorry.

460
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:25,674
Look I just...I can't leave until I know right now

461
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:28,593
that you're not going to send me to somebody else.

462
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:31,152
That was never my intention.

463
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,150
You're a liar.

464
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,989
You are a liar,

465
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:43,307
and why would I want to see a psychiatrist
who's a big fat liar anyway?

466
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:46,746
Tracey?

467
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,480
Hey.

468
00:49:57,877 --> 00:49:58,998
I gotta go. No, I gotta go.

469
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,997
-Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa¡­...
-I've got to go.

470
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:06,555
I just don't like owing anybody, anything. Okay?

471
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:10,273
Alright look. You don't owe anybody anything
but there's going to be a blizzard out there,

472
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:14,351
alright? The weather channel says exposed skin
can be frost bitten in three minutes.

473
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:17,510
And that snow has this effect on people.
It's hypnotic. It's the white.

474
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,310
Too much whiteness, okay?

475
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:23,308
People fall asleep in the snow. Nobody finds them
'til the spring and they're fucking dead.

476
00:50:23,308 --> 00:50:25,707
Don't you watch the weather channel?
People are dying out there.

477
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:27,706
I've got to find my brother.

478
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:29,065
Okay, okay, okay, look, look, look.

479
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:30,745
I'll...I will help you find your brother.

480
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:35,103
But you can't go out there now
because it is very dangerous and you will die.

481
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:36,782
But when the blizzard passes,

482
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,221
I'll find your brother, okay?

483
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:42,700
-He will be happy. The three of us
can go for dollar pancakes.
-What if he's dead, you know?

484
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,379
-He's not fucking dead.
-What if he's dead, you know?

485
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:47,578
-He's not fucking......
-I have looked all over for him.

486
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,417
-I have looked everywhere.
-Look, Your brother is not dead.

487
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,416
Maybe he's in a police station

488
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,976
or he's in a fucking donut shop

489
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,015
or some family picked him up.

490
00:50:55,015 --> 00:50:57,094
But he is not dead.

491
00:50:58,693 --> 00:50:59,734
How do you know?

492
00:50:59,734 --> 00:51:04,091
Because I got a good feeling and
my feelings are always right. That's how I know.

493
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,571
How do you know?

494
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:08,610
Come on.

495
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,488
-Are we or are we not officially friends?
-I guess.

496
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:17,046
Okay. Come on.

497
00:51:17,046 --> 00:51:20,406
Then just hang out 'til this blizzard passes

498
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:23,004
and I'll find your brother, alright? I swear.

499
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:24,603
I'm fucking Lance,

500
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:28,282
alright? I'm good for it. Ask anybody.
You could ask all these guys,

501
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:29,922
alright?

502
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:32,080
Scout's honor.

503
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,240
Come on.

504
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:40,598
Look at that. Look at this crow.

505
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:42,717
Oh. Fucking hell. Look at the crow.

506
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:45,635
-It kind of looks sad.
-How does this crow look sad?

507
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:49,954
I don't know. It's just, like, you know,
it's not like peeping or...or anything.

508
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:53,713
Oh, boo hoo. Stupid crow
doesn't have the fucking brains to fly south.

509
00:51:53,793 --> 00:51:56,591
I'm gonna get him. Let's bring him in.

510
00:51:56,111 --> 00:51:59,589
No! Don't touch it.

511
00:51:59,629 --> 00:52:02,709
Now it's not going to be able to go back
to its natural habitat.

512
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:03,508
Oh sure it will.

513
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:05,187
No, it won't. Everybody knows that.

514
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:08,627
You put a fucking human smell on it,
it's going to be a freak,

515
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,865
and the other crows are going to kill it.

516
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:15,384
Crow is fine. Aren't you, big fella?
See, he was just lonely out there.

517
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:16,903
I like crow.

518
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,462
Chicken of the tree.

519
00:52:18,462 --> 00:52:20,341
Don't say that. Crows are like people.

520
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:23,501
They're not like people. They have
a very different psyche as a matter of fact.

521
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:26,019
They've have a crow consciousness.

522
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:37,695
Well at least we don't have to
worry about the crow no more, allright?

523
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:47,970
Well that was very mature.

524
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,849
What the fuck I ever do to you?

525
00:52:55,368 --> 00:52:56,528
You killed it.

526
00:52:56,528 --> 00:52:57,967
-What?
-You killed it.

527
00:52:57,967 --> 00:52:59,406
-What?
-The bird is dead, you asshole.

528
00:52:59,406 --> 00:53:02,166
The bird is dead, asshole.

529
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:04,045
Oh, I see.

530
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:05,884
Because I killed a bird --

531
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,922
by accident --

532
00:53:08,282 --> 00:53:09,723
I'm now a murderer.

533
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:10,962
I'd like to interject here.

534
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:16,080
I have never willingly inflicted pain or hurt anyone.

535
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,358
I happen to be incapable of it.

536
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,036
Y-you want me to leave now?

537
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:30,914
You know, I...you wore me out,
I ca-- if you want to go,

538
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:35,832
I...think what you want about me.

539
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,709
It wasn't my fuckin' fault.

540
00:53:46,028 --> 00:53:47,027
Ball.

541
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:48,626
Ball.

542
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:49,587
Ball.

543
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:52,026
Sonny never should've followed me.

544
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:54,344
I mean, you can't control him.

545
00:53:55,704 --> 00:53:57,184
Bad dog.

546
00:53:58,023 --> 00:53:59,942
Bad dog.

547
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:02,181
Bad Sonny.

548
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:14,377
What are you still doing here?

549
00:54:16,056 --> 00:54:19,055
-I want to.......
-You want to what?

550
00:54:21,654 --> 00:54:23,773
Stay, I guess.

551
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:31,850
You can stay as long as you like.
It's your prerogative.

552
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,649
Yeah, I know.

553
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:37,768
I don't give a fuck either way,

554
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:39,087
you know.

555
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:41,926
Yeah, I know that.

556
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,999
We can take a plane.

557
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,037
I had a car. But I fucking smashed it.

558
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:07,076
But you know...

559
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:09,075
I've got friends there.

560
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:11,155
It'll be cool. It'll be super-cool.

561
00:55:13,673 --> 00:55:14,593
Look.

562
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:21,870
You see that.

563
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,269
The water's blue like that all year round.

564
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:30,346
-Who is that?
-Me

565
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:32,067
Fuck!

566
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:38,704
Okay, ah...go behind the curtain.

567
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:45,301
Look, just be cool, man. Just be cool.

568
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,661
I don't want to be cool.

569
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:48,540
I don't want to be cool, at all.

570
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,059
What's wrong, Lance?
You forget about our little deal?

571
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:54,377
Listen, it was very dry out there.

572
00:55:57,016 --> 00:56:01,135
-So what are you trying to say to me?
-I'm saying I don't have it
but I'll have it tomorrow.

573
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:05,533
Fuck that.

574
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:08,092
Look, it didn't work  out. I'm sorry.

575
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,011
Fuck sorry.

576
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,890
What do you want from me, man?

577
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,009
I want what you owe me.

578
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:25,245
You know something, man?

579
00:56:25,245 --> 00:56:29,004
End of the fucking day,
I just want my fucking piece.

580
00:56:29,004 --> 00:56:32,202
You know, Lance,
you want to be one of my business associates,

581
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,202
but you're nothing but a fucking 'ho.

582
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:36,521
Nothing better than a fucking 'ho.

583
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:39,520
-Just back off.
-Fucking sit down.

584
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,799
-No.
-Yes.

585
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,118
-No.
-Fuck you.

586
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:46,437
Bitch.

587
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:51,794
What do you got to say to me now, Lance? Huh?

588
00:56:52,274 --> 00:56:54,394
What do you got to say to me now, bitch?

589
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:57,312
What?

590
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:00,072
You fucking...

591
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:10,667
Oh, yeah.

592
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,267
Please don't. Please......

593
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,146
Don't you...

594
00:57:15,146 --> 00:57:20,424
-Please? Please? Please? Please?
Please take the fucking shirt off.
-Please don't...

595
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:21,863
Oh, come on... come on, man.

596
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:23,102
-Please don't......
-Don't make me hurt you.

597
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:24,822
-I'll just scream, okay?
-Oh, yeah?

598
00:57:24,822 --> 00:57:27,741
-Somebody will call the police.
-Oh, they will?

599
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:31,939
Here, fucking take this shit off!
Nobody's calling nobody.

600
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,857
What the fuck? What the fuck is wrong with you?

601
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:39,296
I've got a condition. I'm just going to vomit.

602
00:57:39,296 --> 00:57:40,336
I don't give a shit.

603
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:43,814
It's all about the pussy and the ass today,
isn't it? Huh?

604
00:57:43,814 --> 00:57:45,613
Give Daddy these pants, baby.

605
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:46,453
Give Daddy these pants.

606
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:48,053
Please, please, please...

607
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:51,011
Come on, it's meat Lance. Choice fucking...

608
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:52,730
I love you, Tracey Berkowitz.

609
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,331
Fuck off.

610
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,289
Fuck!

611
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,168
Fuck! Fuck! ......

612
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,647
Fuck! My neck!

613
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:07,045
Fuck! My neck!

614
00:58:26,197 --> 00:58:32,755
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you.Fuck you. Fuck you.....

615
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:35,594
I'm not the one that needs a freakin' shrink...

616
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:36,434
You can never tell...

617
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:38,153
You'll never tell...

618
00:58:38,153 --> 00:58:40,352
I don't know what to believe...

619
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:41,311
I have an amazing life...

620
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:52,067
and what not to believe...

621
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:45,966
He's a dog...

622
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:48,845
It was their fault.

623
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,324
They never should've grounded me.

624
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:57,642
Sonny is a dog. He's a dog...

625
01:01:06,774 --> 01:01:07,934
I'm not what you think.

626
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:09,693
I'm not junk,

627
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:11,253
I'm not a dink.

628
01:01:11,573 --> 01:01:18,090
I'm not garbage flowers you leave to rot
and stink and smell and curl up all dry and papery

629
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:24,568
so they crumble as crusty as the flowers
on this fucked-up shower curtain.

630
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,197
Come here so I can talk to you.

631
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:53,356
I can't talk to you from over there.

632
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,551
You need a drive or something?

633
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:10,669
No. No, it's okay.

634
01:02:14,788 --> 01:02:17,626
-No. No, no, no, I should...
-See you.

635
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:19,986
No.

636
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,344
You're in my class, right?

637
01:02:23,624 --> 01:02:25,824
You're name's, uh...

638
01:02:25,824 --> 01:02:26,983
-what's your name?
-Tracey.

639
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:28,822
Tracey, right.

640
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:31,221
We can go someplace, Tracey.

641
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,739
Where would we go? Where would we go?

642
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,978
No, no, I-I-I can't. I......

643
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,177
Where would we go?

644
01:02:42,857 --> 01:02:43,976
Drive around.

645
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:52,853
You know, I-I-I don't know. I-I-I heard, um,

646
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,491
on the news, there's like a, um,

647
01:02:56,811 --> 01:03:00,010
this really crazy blizzard coming.

648
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,448
Like huge snowdrifts and um,

649
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:08,926
frostbite and um,

650
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,484
we might not have to go to school.

651
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:15,684
Like I would, anyway, you know.

652
01:03:30,398 --> 01:03:32,077
I should go.

653
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,049
Sonny? Sonny?

654
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:34,638
Sonny, please!

655
01:08:36,037 --> 01:08:37,717
Sonny!

656
01:08:38,516 --> 01:08:40,476
Sonny......

657
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:41,932
My name is Tracey Berkowitz.

658
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:49,089
Just a normal girl.

659
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:31,632
My name is Tracey Berkowitz.

660
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,191
Fifteen.

661
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:41,468
Just a normal girl.

662
01:10:43,348 --> 01:10:46,746
My name is Tracey Berkowitz.
Fifteen. Just a normal girl.

663
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:48,586
I have an amazing life.

664
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:53,103
My name is Tracey Berkowitz.

665
01:10:53,703 --> 01:10:54,782
Fifteen.

666
01:10:57,502 --> 01:10:59,261
Just a normal girl.

667
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,420
Just a normal girl.

668
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:07,018
Don't sleep.

669
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:09,417
Promise me.

670
01:11:10,697 --> 01:11:13,495
Promise me. You won't sleep.

671
01:11:18,054 --> 01:11:20,892
We have to find him.

672
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:26,850
No one can stop me.

673
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:31,608
No one can make me stand still.

674
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,967
No one can stop me.

675
01:11:38,846 --> 01:11:41,284
No one can make me stand still.

676
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,083
Hey look, there it is.

677
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,922
What'd it get itself into?

678
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:49,762
Hey, Tracey.

679
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:52,240
No one can stop me.

680
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,519
No one can make me stand still.
