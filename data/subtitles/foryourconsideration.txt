{1022}{1060}{y:i}Can you hear them?
{1064}{1110}{y:i}The night noises.
{1114}{1177}{y:i}Mockingbird in the magnolia.
{1183}{1256}{y:i}See the moss hanging|{y:i}from the moonlight.
{1269}{1337}{y:i}Fairly taste the night, can't you?
{1387}{1498}{y:i}You're part of it, Pres,|{y:i}and it's part of you.
{1532}{1580}{y:i}Like I am.
{1604}{1678}{y:i}You can't get away from us, Pres,|{y:i}we're both in your blood.
{1682}{1767}{y:i}This is the country you were born to,|{y:i}the country you know and trust.
{1777}{1854}{y:i}Your country, Pres.|{y:i}Amy wouldn't understand.
{1858}{1926}{y:i}- She'd think there would be snakes.|{y:i}- Julie, please.
{1930}{1978}{y:i}Oh, it isn't tame. It isn't like the North.
{1982}{2040}{y:i}It's quick and dangerous,|{y:i}but you trust it.
{2044}{2120}{y:i}Remember how the fever mist smells|{y:i}in the bottoms, rank and rotten...
{2132}{2200}{y:i}...but you trust that, too,|{y:i}because it's part of you...
{2204}{2306}{y:i}...just as I'm part of you|{y:i}and will never let you go.
{3008}{3047}Yes, ma'am?
{3068}{3098}Hello. Where's Richard?
{3108}{3174}Oh, he's not in today.|Could I have your name, please?
{3184}{3246}Hack, Marilyn Hack. Stage 1 1 .
{3314}{3388}I'm sorry, l-- You look familiar.|Are you an actor?
{3404}{3436}Thirty- two years.
{3453}{3527}Yeah. You were in that prison movie|with Sharon Stone.
{3539}{3562}No.
{3567}{3651}And you had that scene where you|punched that little girl in the face.
{3656}{3714}- Not me.|- That was a good movie.
{3718}{3771}You should have been in that movie.
{3788}{3840}I'm sure I should have been.|May I go in?
{3844}{3883}Sure. And you're all set.
{3901}{3943}Have a good one.
{4054}{4083}Yes.
{4088}{4144}- Got a chair open.|- Oh, Sandy, am I late?
{4148}{4208}- Oh, you're fine.|- Oh, I'm so sorry.
{4212}{4318}Per our conversation yesterday,|I think steer clear of the Sephardic tones.
{4322}{4391}Go for the A- one or the A- two,|the Ashkenazi palette.
{4395}{4447}I didn't mean to make|such a big deal out of it.
{4451}{4477}Oh, it's nothing.
{4481}{4543}I just thought I could look a little younger,|couldn't I?
{4548}{4599}- But it's okay.|- You are playing an older woman.
{4604}{4666}But I could be a woman|who's taken good care of herself.
{4670}{4709}Who has a terminal illness.
{4713}{4782}Up until then, l--|You're right. You're right.
{4786}{4844}Liz said I should get|my face stonewashed like her--
{4848}{4931}Oh, honey, are we aware of|what was on cable last night?
{4936}{4983}{y:i}Song for Reuben.
{4987}{5052}Honey, you killed me.|When was the last time you saw that?
{5056}{5106}- I've never seen it.|- I was a total puddle.
{5110}{5172}I mean, complete waterworks.|They had to resuscitate me.
{5176}{5266}I'm never gonna watch it again unless my|wife takes up CPR or paramedics move in.
{5270}{5304}I was dying.
{5308}{5343}We were babies then, weren't we?
{5347}{5383}- Yes, we were.|- Babies.
{5388}{5457}You have such a gift,|you shouldn't just keep it to yourself.
{5461}{5523}- You should teach.|- Teach?
{5527}{5566}Teach acting.
{5580}{5605}I wouldn't dare.
{5609}{5683}You gotta give it away to keep it.|You can't just hold on to this.
{5687}{5719}Sandy, now you're mocking me.
{5724}{5783}You might as well say,|''Why don't you save the world?''
{5787}{5844}Well, maybe you could|with what you have to give.
{5855}{5907}Victor. Victor.
{5912}{5944}- Hey.|- Oh, Morley.
{5948}{5996}- Yeah.|- What the hell are you doing here?
{6000}{6031}- What am I doing here?|- Yeah.
{6035}{6104}- You wanted to have a meeting?|- Yes. Yesterday.
{6108}{6160}We had a meeting scheduled.|You didn't show.
{6164}{6240}Yesterday? No, no, no.|No, no. What the hell are you talking--?
{6244}{6300}I was in the office all day.|Why didn't you call--?
{6304}{6361}I called you.|You didn't return my message.
{6365}{6446}- Well, you got a minute now, because--?|- No, I have to go to the stage.
{6450}{6494}What did you wanna talk about?
{6498}{6549}A lot of things. But, look...
{6557}{6588}...l'm working for scale.
{6592}{6649}An actor of my stature,|40 years in the business?
{6653}{6700}There's no excuse for me|working for scale.
{6704}{6755}That's exactly what|I've been telling people.
{6759}{6807}- You should not be working for scale.|- Good.
{6811}{6882}But you know these producers,|they have their own take on things.
{6886}{6942}I'm on your side, all right? I'm your agent.
{6946}{6987}You are my number- one priority.
{6991}{7090}There is nothing more important to me|in my life than--
{7094}{7127}Than you. Excuse me.
{7131}{7166}Yeah.
{7195}{7230}Stranger, what do you say?
{7245}{7296}Nothing important. I'm here with a client.
{7300}{7331}- I gotta go.|- Hang on.
{7335}{7431}Good, because I gotta take this, Victor.|Look, stop by the office any time.
{7436}{7475}You know, we moved.
{7492}{7515}Yeah, talk.
{7520}{7571}I've done all my homework|on this guy.
{7575}{7627}I've established everything|there is to know...
{7631}{7687}...as far as his short- term objectives go.
{7691}{7757}I know that I wanna defend my sister,|console my father...
{7761}{7812}...and, ultimately, I feel a sense of guilt...
{7816}{7906}...for having abandoned my shipmates in|the Galápagos Islands to come home, but--
{7910}{7959}I think you're making this|too complicated.
{7972}{8033}This is not about,|''What is the actor thinking?''
{8037}{8123}You go and see a movie, you don't say,|''I wonder what he's thinking.''
{8128}{8175}You gotta know.|Can you see the difference?
{8179}{8252}That's exactly my problem....|I wanna show you what I'm thinking...
{8256}{8320}...but there are certain things|that I'm not sure about.
{8324}{8399}- I love the fact that you did all this work.|- Yeah.
{8403}{8464}I think it will help you later,|but not on this movie...
{8468}{8507}...if you know what I mean.
{8525}{8618}Oh, my God. Doesn't he know about|her allergies? Here's what you have to do...
{8622}{8681}...you have to call me tomorrow--|Give me two secs.
{8685}{8768}--as soon as they get back|and let me know exactly what happened.
{8772}{8841}Bye. I'm so excited for you. Bye.
{8846}{8910}Hey. Sorry about that.
{8963}{9095}Miss Campanella, this publicity campaign|is to be run with military precision.
{9100}{9201}It is to be timely, quantifiable|and orotund.
{9205}{9243}- Do you know what that means?|- No.
{9247}{9316}I warn you. These are actors.
{9320}{9419}In every actor there lives a tiger, a pig,|an ass and a nightingale.
{9423}{9479}You never know|which one's gonna show up.
{9483}{9583}Don't make assumptions about the talent.|Don't assume that the talent can hear well.
{9587}{9682}Don't assume they know the plot.|Don't assume that they have living parents.
{9686}{9748}Don't assume that|they don't have a drop of Indian blood.
{9752}{9818}Question, do I look like|I have Indian blood?
{9840}{9872}- Not at all--|- Question...
{9876}{9987}...would it surprise you to learn|that I am one- eighth mighty Choctaw?
{9998}{10028}- It would--|- Question...
{10032}{10128}...would it astound you to learn|that here on the set, I am Corey Taft...
{10132}{10185}...but when I'm at home, I'm Jo- Jo?
{10196}{10227}Picture's up.
{10232}{10279}- Roll sound.|- Sound speed.
{10284}{10319}And dolly.
{10354}{10414}And action.
{10458}{10504}She's not coming.
{10515}{10630}She's not coming home|to see her sick mother.
{10634}{10682}She'll be home.
{10712}{10769}And you, Shmuel?
{10780}{10820}How long do you think you can stay?
{10831}{10876}I don't rightly know, Daddy.
{10880}{10928}Long as it takes, I expect.
{10932}{11008}The Navy's pretty accommodating|about things like illness...
{11041}{11080}...and death.
{11115}{11178}Your mama was so happy|to see you today.
{11182}{11236}Oh, I know she couldn't show it...
{11240}{11315}...but she was "kvelling" in her own way.
{11320}{11395}{y:i}She smiled,|{y:i}but I don't know if she knew who I was.
{11399}{11468}{y:i}Your coming home today|{y:i}was a dang mitzvah, is what it was.
{11472}{11542}It ain't no mitzvah, Daddy.|It's family.
{11546}{11588}It's what a son does for his mama.
{11592}{11649}And what does a daughter do|for her mama?
{11653}{11727}Your sister ain't been home|in nigh onto 1 2 years.
{11731}{11799}I don't give two hoots|what Doc Silverstein says.
{11803}{11920}It was your sister|that put your mama on her deathbed.
{11948}{12030}I know Rachel, Daddy.|And she'll come home to see Mama.
{12047}{12104}And she'll come home|because it's Purim.
{12108}{12162}We all know what that means to Mama...
{12166}{12215}...or meant.
{12234}{12287}Was that Rachel's voice I heard...
{12306}{12373}...or am I just going meshuga?
{12421}{12459}Mama!
{12498}{12540}And cut.
{12556}{12614}Okay, everybody,|stay where you are, please.
{12618}{12660}That's a cut.
{12664}{12707}I thought it was great.|It's fantastic.
{12712}{12763}I just have a couple of suggestions.
{12767}{12810}You guys were great.
{12814}{12887}Simon, the move is too fast,|so we're gonna have to slow it down...
{12892}{12954}...and I wanna add one thing,|so just watch for a second.
{12958}{13054}Marilyn, you had a swooning,|kind of a fainting move which I love.
{13058}{13104}It's great. I love the eyes rolling back.
{13108}{13172}I want you to add one more thing,|something more...
{13176}{13276}...almost from the bottom|of your womanhood to make it a:
{13311}{13339}So let-- Let me--
{13344}{13403}- Let me see what that would look like.|- Okay.
{13556}{13623}Exactly. And Brian, I love that thing.
{13628}{13683}Let me see that, just that flash.
{13691}{13787}No, not the intake of breath,|just the eyes flashing as if:
{13792}{13864}''Mommy is going now?''
{13868}{13919}So this is gonna be great.
{13923}{13958}Whitney? Hi there.
{13963}{14012}- Can I talk with you for a moment?|- Oh, yeah.
{14016}{14062}Hi. You okay in there?
{14096}{14142}- Not interrupting a meal or anything?|- No.
{14157}{14221}Sorry I'm on this thing. I hurt my back.
{14225}{14287}- I fell over the side of an escalator.|- Great.
{14291}{14412}Whitney, I have to tell you that|I have been a publicist for 20 years--
{14416}{14503}Fifteen and five strapped to the gurney.
{14507}{14625}I have never experienced|the hostility that this little picture...
{14629}{14733}...which I think is a charming show,|is engendering in the community.
{14737}{14830}I've had hang- ups.|I've had rude-- Rude responses.
{14834}{14921}- That's not what I'm getting on this one.|- That's not good. But you know what?
{14925}{14999}It's all right because we should go|a whole different angle...
{15003}{15052}- ...that no one's even thought of.|- Okay.
{15056}{15124}What if we go the angle of|let's play it down?
{15128}{15199}Let's tell people not to see our show?
{15203}{15265}- What about--?|- That's a dangerous sell, Whitney.
{15269}{15335}Put a big ad in the paper|and say, ''Don't come.''
{15339}{15378}Okay. True enough.
{15382}{15509}But as my proud ancestors,|the Choctaw, say...
{15513}{15563}...what we're dealing with|on this picture is:
{15645}{15733}Difficult to translate it.|Basically, we don't have a blanket.
{15737}{15804}We don't have a blanket for a--
{15840}{15895}It's a diuretic pony, I'm sorry--
{15899}{15987}Urinary- problem pony to piss on.|Excuse me.
{15999}{16037}- Give me one sec.|- Okay.
{16041}{16093}- Just look up.|- I just need one sec.
{16097}{16142}Can you do that without touching me?
{16178}{16203}You're fine.
{16207}{16236}- Gorgeous.|- Thank you.
{16240}{16300}- I'm almost set here. We're rolling.|- We're good?
{16308}{16362}Okay. Actors.
{16366}{16402}Actors acting.
{16412}{16448}- Good.|- Not right now.
{16452}{16505}- But, yeah.|- Oh, you don't think you are?
{16509}{16561}I mean, we're all acting all the time.
{16565}{16614}You know, but I'm acting differently.
{16624}{16681}So tell me, "Home for Purim."
{16685}{16727}{y:i}- Home for Purim.|- Yeah.
{16732}{16771}It's a period film.
{16775}{16851}- Yeah.|- I play Rachel Pischer.
{16859}{16923}I play Sam Pischer,|her brother, little brother.
{16927}{16963}Yeah.
{16974}{17041}But, which brings me to,|I heard a rumor that you two are:
{17087}{17116}- Yeah....|- Is that true?
{17120}{17179}- Depends on what you mean by:|- That's so cool.
{17183}{17223}- That's really cute.|- It is.
{17228}{17272}We are-- That-- It's a very--
{17276}{17374}It's a very interesting scenario,|playing siblings, living the life of lovers.
{17378}{17464}Well, tell me how you both|got started in acting as art?
{17468}{17556}I started doing standup|at Jerry Seltzer's Laff Emporium.
{17560}{17674}I was at Chortles, The Comedy Place.
{17678}{17753}And-- But no one really--
{17757}{17828}- No one really got it.|- I got it.
{17832}{17891}- I thought it was hysterical.|- What did she do?
{17895}{17936}She has a show. Tell her the title.
{17940}{18007}{y:i}- No Penis Intended.|- Oh, I actually did hear, yes.
{18011}{18067}- What was that about?|- One critic described it as:
{18071}{18192}''A humorless romp|into Miss Webb's dysfunctional psyche.''
{18196}{18254}- That's a humorless critic.|- That doesn't make sense.
{18258}{18292}- No.|- No.
{18456}{18503}Tuesday night. Eleven- ish.
{18507}{18570}Diamond Pawnbroker|on Sterling and Fifth.
{18574}{18650}- Ring a bell?|- Yeah. There was a break- in.
{18654}{18691}And did you make out the report?
{18704}{18762}- Did I what?|- You heard me, son!
{18766}{18814}Yes, I made out the report.
{18818}{18927}This report is an l- N270,|file number 79251J.
{18932}{19012}It is not a 35- DIB...
{19016}{19073}{y:i}...and should not be filed as such.
{19077}{19130}{y:i}Do I make myself clear?
{19157}{19204}That's a good clip. That was a good clip.
{19208}{19242}I loved that. I love the movie.
{19246}{19308}"Paper Badge," I just loved it.|What a roller- coaster ride.
{19312}{19356}Nothing happened!
{19360}{19422}- Nothing happened in that clip.|- But that's the beauty--
{19426}{19508}Yes, it's about time in a film|nothing happened. It's about time.
{19512}{19594}It always, it's-- People get|to story points and have a little problem...
{19598}{19682}- ...and then they say, ''Let's blow it up.''|- I am not one for violence...
{19686}{19756}...but I would have given anything|to see a coffee pot explode.
{19760}{19803}What a brave choice the director made.
{19807}{19871}What a-- What a pioneer this guy is.|''Let's do nothing.''
{19883}{19963}{y:i}Sometimes it looks like somebody hit you|{y:i}with a frying pan and you enjoyed it.
{19967}{20055}{y:i}But I have been hit.|{y:i}Been hit a couple of times.
{20059}{20177}{y:i}You know, this film reminds me of your wife|{y:i}and her ceramic turtle collection.
{20181}{20230}Can't believe you keep this|in your purse.
{20234}{20296}- Well, you never know.|- Yeah.
{20300}{20410}Mr. Orfkin, for the third time,|Victor Allan Miller is waiting.
{20415}{20484}Oh, okay, just give me five seconds|and then send him in.
{20614}{20648}Right this way, Mr. Miller.
{20652}{20719}Now, you listen to me, Bernie,|you may run a studio...
{20723}{20828}...but I've got way too much respect for|my clients to put up with this kind of crap.
{20832}{20875}Hang on. Simi, hold all my calls.
{20880}{20960}I'm in a meeting with Victor Allan Miller.|I do not wanna be disturbed.
{20964}{21005}I gotta run. Ciao.
{21009}{21068}- Thank you, Simi.|- Hey, look at you.
{21072}{21130}- Look at you.|- You look fantastic.
{21134}{21209}- Thank you. Thank you.|- You should be stopping by more often.
{21213}{21268}- Really? I know, I know.|- Yes, you should.
{21272}{21348}But we're not filming today,|I thought I'd drop by, say hello...
{21352}{21392}...while my tires are being rotated.
{21396}{21435}- Well, let's talk movies.|- Okay.
{21439}{21498}Okay? Movies.
{21503}{21574}There's nothing going on|in movies right now for you.
{21578}{21634}I mean, it's just-- This is the thing.
{21638}{21691}There was just--|There's no interest, okay?
{21695}{21739}You're like a cold piece of toast.
{21744}{21789}I'm not gonna|candy- coat things for you...
{21793}{21863}...because if you want candy- coated|information, go someplace--
{21867}{21923}Go to one of the bigger agencies.|Okay? Because l--
{21927}{21971}My thing is say it like it is.
{21976}{22059}But right now I don't think film|is what we should be focusing on.
{22064}{22167}Quite frankly, I think television|is where we should be looking.
{22171}{22259}- I know, but television--|- Okay, we're on a couple of pilots. Listen.
{22263}{22292}Listen, Victor.
{22296}{22368}There are some very exciting things.|Joel?
{22372}{22415}{y:i}Singing the Blues.
{22420}{22512}The dysfunctional Blue family|rises to a position of prominence...
{22516}{22580}...in a small New England town.
{22584}{22675}- Very, very powerful. And l--|- Was that a drama or a comedy?
{22680}{22760}It's a comedy because it's--|They're dysfunctional.
{22764}{22807}The whole family's dysfunctional.
{22811}{22875}The father doesn't know.|The kids don't know. Nobody knows!
{22880}{22946}Nobody knows what's going|because of the whole dysfunction.
{22950}{23004}And that's-- That's the beauty of that.
{23065}{23154}Simon, all I'm saying is I want it|to be brighter. That's all I'm saying to you.
{23158}{23229}I want to come in the room|and I wanna see an object like the--
{23233}{23355}Like a chair or a light or a sofa|and be able to make out what it is.
{23359}{23394}- Do you understand me?|- I get it.
{23398}{23436}If you get it, then you turn it up.
{23440}{23546}Look, I know my job is to translate|your vision into the real world, okay?
{23550}{23596}But the problem is, I don't see a vision.
{23600}{23642}- Can I ask you a question?|- Yeah, sure.
{23646}{23719}Do you know how tight my aperture is|right now? Have you any idea?
{23723}{23792}If you're being a smart- ass,|I'm gonna put you across my knee.
{23796}{23827}I want it to be bright.
{23832}{23911}It's bright. It's brighter than|Stephen bloody Hawking in here.
{23916}{23979}- Up, up, up. Just turn it up for me.|- All right. Fine.
{23984}{24054}- Thank you. Thank you.|- You're the boss. You're the boss.
{24058}{24106}- Whole way.|- That's all there is.
{24110}{24164}- There you go. Look at that. Lovely.|- I love this.
{24168}{24229}I love it because I look and I go,|''Hey, it's a room.''
{24233}{24280}It's a sports stadium, is what it is now.
{24292}{24318}You're so European.
{24322}{24392}There's something about you|that's just foreign.
{24396}{24471}Have you ever been to--?|You travel a lot or...?
{24475}{24551}No, I've-- I haven't been|out of the United States, actually.
{24572}{24623}Who is your--?|Who is your acting coach again?
{24627}{24669}- Leonid Kazovskich.|- Oh, she's good.
{24673}{24724}- She's amazing.|- He, it's a he.
{24728}{24827}Wasn't she the one that made her students|have nervous breakdowns?
{24832}{24866}- He, and yeah.|- Oh, it was a he.
{24870}{24926}It wasn't really necessarily|a nervous breakdown...
{24930}{24996}...it was more of, you know,|he would just break you down.
{25000}{25055}- You know, get rid of everything.|- Well, they're--
{25059}{25142}- That's not the thing out here, is it?|- It's a breath of fresh air out here.
{25147}{25205}- It's really not.|- At least that's intense and real.
{25209}{25257}I mean, out here it's like|magazine people.
{25261}{25303}Here it's all soda pop and blue jeans.
{25308}{25383}Excuse me, guys. Fifteen minutes,|we'll be ready for you on set.
{25388}{25450}Could you instead of|referring to me as ''guys'' ...
{25454}{25521}...could you refer to me by|my character name, Mary Pat?
{25535}{25564}- Sure.|- Great.
{25568}{25599}- Sure.|- That's great.
{25603}{25666}- I apologize.|- No, no. Apology accepted.
{25670}{25739}It helps me. I appreciate it.
{25855}{25957}Move that up about another 5 feet.|Yeah, straight on up. That's good.
{25962}{26003}- How's it going, mate?|- Good.
{26008}{26041}Excuse me. Sorry.
{26045}{26129}- So much food and nothing to eat.|- Yeah. Absolutely.
{26133}{26176}What waste.
{26200}{26269}Ever notice, like, a kind of|a weird smell around here?
{26273}{26342}It's like-- It's just in this area.|It's kind of a....
{26372}{26403}I don't know. Maybe it's me.
{26408}{26501}Well, my father would say,|''A fox smells his own hole first.''
{26587}{26623}Simon...
{26684}{26790}...I need to ask you a question,|but I don't want the answer.
{26803}{26901}I'll ask it anyway,|but stop me if you can, all right?
{26905}{26959}Stop me. Stop me.|How does the film look?
{26963}{27019}No. Stop me again. How do I look?
{27024}{27083}- You didn't stop me.|- No. I can stop you now.
{27087}{27135}- You look absolutely amazing.|- Okay, good.
{27139}{27190}I'm sorry I asked.|I didn't mean to bother you.
{27194}{27223}- No, please.|- No, I mean....
{27228}{27306}That's enough. I don't need any--|That's good. I'm glad to hear it.
{27310}{27346}- Oh, you know what?|- So it's good?
{27351}{27469}I forgot to mention. My girlfriend|was on the Internet last weekend...
{27476}{27539}...and she was checking out|her specialty sites.
{27544}{27619}Anyway, she got bored with that|and ended up...
{27623}{27674}...on one of the movie gossip things,|you know.
{27678}{27779}Filmtattle.com|or one of those celluloid....
{27783}{27830}- Do you ever go on those?|- I wouldn't know.
{27834}{27898}Well, anyway,|the long and the short of it is...
{27902}{27980}...some bloke got on the set...
{27984}{28079}...and he reckons there could be an|Academy Award nomination in the offing.
{28083}{28140}And more specifically,|he said that he thought...
{28144}{28223}...your performance|was likely to get recognized.
{28230}{28292}You know, come the announcements.
{28303}{28395}Anyway, thought I'd just share that,|for whatever it's worth.
{28421}{28461}See you out there.
{28494}{28557}All right, everybody, back to work.
{28654}{28695}- Whitney Taylor Brown.|- Yes.
{28700}{28729}That's a lot of names.
{28772}{28827}So you're a producer.
{28831}{28887}A woman producer.
{28900}{28943}What does a producer do?
{28948}{29011}Well, as my assistant, Lincoln,|can tell you...
{29015}{29082}...there's a lot of telephone calls|and, you know...
{29086}{29242}...lots of getting out the wallet and paying|for sometimes ridiculous things like--
{29246}{29287}Like snacks.
{29339}{29400}Let's go back|to the beginning of your career.
{29404}{29457}You are-- Your family is|in the diaper business?
{29461}{29514}Yes. Brown Diaper Service.
{29518}{29602}And what exactly did they do|with the diapers?
{29606}{29711}Well, they picked up the diapers|in big trucks...
{29715}{29795}...and then we washed them...
{29799}{29859}...and then gave them back|to the people.
{29870}{29953}That's neat. Thank you so much.
{29960}{30019}- We're done? We're done.|- Yeah, we're done.
{30024}{30063}All of it's done.
{30068}{30120}Don't you wanna know more about me?
{30131}{30215}Yeah, but we-- I don't--|We don't have time right now, so....
{30220}{30291}Thank you, though,|for talking to us and....
{30295}{30372}I don't want anyone to know|what I look like from the back...
{30376}{30442}...so I don't want anyone to film my exit.
{30446}{30497}Okay, it's off. It's not even on.
{30501}{30547}All right.
{30566}{30621}First of all, it's been so creative for us.
{30625}{30687}Every aspect of the movie,|I think, is represented.
{30691}{30743}I hope you like it as much|as we liked doing it.
{30748}{30816}The first, of course,|is a sort of Norman Rockwell.
{30820}{30862}It's America. It's the family eating.
{30898}{30976}You have the title in the Hebraic letters.
{30980}{31081}All right, well, my first instinct says|it reminds me of my family.
{31085}{31125}- Which we--|- And I hate my family.
{31129}{31192}And I think a lot of people|might feel that way.
{31233}{31335}I think that's such a fascinating take|on what we've done...
{31339}{31437}...because we've gotten away|from the family...
{31441}{31474}...and we make it this.
{31506}{31539}Man, that one is scary.
{31543}{31585}You got disembodied heads.
{31589}{31672}You know what I like?|I like when it's misleading in a good way.
{31676}{31715}This looks like a horror film.
{31719}{31799}It's horrifying, but like,|it's horrifying like a horror movie.
{31804}{31871}Someone's killed their children|and made them into cookies...
{31876}{31912}...and I wanna go see that.
{31916}{31968}Oh, okay. This was also trying to be...
{31972}{32058}...a kind of family kind of presentation,|kind of a comedy thing, but--
{32062}{32149}What's creepy about this one is how|y'all made it where they eyes follow you.
{32153}{32230}That's scary.|Everywhere you go, they follow you.
{32234}{32280}You actually do want that in a poster...
{32284}{32350}...because when you set the posters|in the theater...
{32354}{32425}...as people walk by, you want that,|you actually do want that.
{32429}{32474}I'm really glad that you picked that up.
{32478}{32539}That's what we're trying to do|with both the visual...
{32543}{32588}...and maybe even something|with the eyes.
{32592}{32663}And, of course, this is just a gay romp.
{32667}{32733}- It's a party. It's fun.|- You also see the wistfulness here.
{32737}{32779}What's good about this is it's real.
{32784}{32835}It's very real.|I've been to a party before...
{32839}{32934}...where people's heads|were actually on the balloons.
{32939}{33003}I wanna go to this party.|This is a party I would go to...
{33007}{33071}- Okay, great.|- ...because it's got balloons with colors.
{33098}{33189}This is so stupid and I'm sorry|to bother you, but I just wondered....
{33193}{33231}There's something on the Internet.
{33236}{33322}Somebody had been on the set,|here, at "Home for Purim..."
{33326}{33413}...and brought up the idea|of there being...
{33417}{33537}...a possibility of a nomination|for an Oscar.
{33564}{33619}It's nothing, no big--|It's a big deal. Who cares?
{33623}{33691}I mean, it's no big deal.|It's nothing. Forget it.
{33695}{33721}- Forget I said it.|- Okay.
{33725}{33767}- I just thought, because...|- All right.
{33772}{33833}...if you Googled Simon Whitset,|apparently, you could--
{33837}{33929}Okay, this is a rumor that's out there|on the Internet and you think it's nothing.
{33933}{34071}Tell you what. I'm gonna look into it.|This could be very interesting indeed.
{34075}{34170}Okay, quick question. The Internet.|That's the one with e- mail, right?
{34174}{34231}- Yes.|- Got it. I'm on it.
{34293}{34366}- Why, did I get--? I had some salad.|- You're good.
{34370}{34417}Philip. Lane, Lane,|Philip, Philip, Philip.
{34421}{34464}- Hi.|- Hello.
{34468}{34559}- Tell me. "Purim." Writers.|{y:i}- Purim.
{34563}{34591}- You're writers.|- Yes.
{34595}{34631}{y:i}Home for Purim.
{34636}{34735}This is probably the most personal play|that we've written.
{34740}{34792}There are elements of my family life.
{34796}{34863}Purim is strictly your territory.|I didn't know what it was.
{34867}{34922}I thought Purim meant ''a face.''|Cute little Purim.
{34926}{34972}- That's a "punim."|- You straightened me out.
{34976}{35028}It's the one in the shack,|where the shrubs--?
{35032}{35104}No, no, no, that's "Sukkot, Sukkot."
{35108}{35163}No, Purim, a lot of people|don't really know.
{35168}{35279}I mean, I didn't know that much|about Purim, but I like Purim a lot.
{35283}{35358}And it's got a tremendous amount|of symbolic...
{35362}{35418}...and metaphorical resonance|wrapped up in there.
{35422}{35466}- You like writing?|- We love to write.
{35470}{35529}- That's great.|- We would write if they didn't pay us.
{35533}{35573}And guess what, they usually don't.
{35577}{35622}- Some--|- That's why we're still teaching.
{35626}{35674}We write just enough|to keep us in teaching.
{35678}{35711}- Put it that way.|- Yeah, yeah.
{35716}{35783}- Let me just throw something at you.|- Okay, okay.
{35788}{35875}Philip, what is your favorite place?
{35930}{35990}I'd say Chicago.
{35994}{36029}Lane?
{36039}{36103}Under my mother's dining room table.
{36212}{36282}She's here, Daddy!|She's coming up the walk!
{36439}{36515}- Hey, sis.|- Hey, little brother.
{36532}{36589}Look at you, all decked out|in Uncle Sam's finest.
{36593}{36681}Well, if Tojo wants a fight,|a fight he's gonna get.
{36693}{36768}- Hello, Daddy.|- Ruchel.
{36801}{36891}My, my, you're a sight for sore eyes.
{36936}{37071}Daddy, Sam, I'd like you to meet my....
{37088}{37180}My friend Mary Pat Hooligan.
{37201}{37308}- Well, welcome to our home.|- Thank you.
{37312}{37339}How's Mama?
{37367}{37399}Rachel?
{37479}{37522}Mama.
{37600}{37642}We're late, I think.
{37646}{37710}It was nice of you|to keep my sister company on this trip.
{37714}{37785}I love Rachel.|We don't spend a lot of time apart.
{37812}{37851}Do you two live near each other?
{37880}{38030}Well, if you call sleeping in the same bed|''near each other,'' I suppose we do.
{38034}{38091}Well, that just don't make no sense.
{38118}{38198}Sam, I love your sister.
{38202}{38252}- And cut.|- That's a cut!
{38256}{38302}- Okay, that was the best one.|- Hold it.
{38306}{38332}Okay, all right. Yeah.
{38336}{38387}Everybody stay where they are, okay?
{38435}{38503}I thought that was great.|Victor, come on out.
{38512}{38565}I thought that was fantastic.|I mean, you know.
{38569}{38623}I didn't think it was exactly|as it should be.
{38628}{38699}- Stinks.|- Tell me what's going on.
{38703}{38755}Okay, I'm just not feeling--|I'm not feeling it.
{38759}{38839}I feel like it's ambiguous.|I don't think it's clear that I'm gay.
{38864}{38923}I mean, I got the look,|but I just think that we're...
{38927}{38976}- ...pussy- footing around--|- Excuse me?
{38980}{39024}- That makes you sound gay.|- lf I say--?
{39028}{39092}Let me approach this a different way,|because you're all--
{39096}{39173}There's obviously something that|isn't jelling about what we just did.
{39177}{39246}- I could be blind. I mean, this walks in--|- No, I understand.
{39251}{39355}Okay, time, time.|Look, this is just.... It's just paper.
{39359}{39506}It's paper and they put a letter and a name|and a word and then they called it a script.
{39510}{39543}But you know what? I'd be--
{39547}{39603}Let's toss this away.|Let's start from scratch.
{39614}{39685}- Oh, Jesus.|- What would you do?
{39689}{39734}Okay.
{39738}{39815}- Where's Whitney? Where's Whitney?|- We don't care about the script.
{39820}{39852}Here's what I'd like to do.
{39856}{39904}And I don't mean to be the leader,|but I am.
{39908}{39976}So let's follow me around a circle.|You follow around.
{39980}{40047}And we kept going.|And remember the mumbling we did.
{40052}{40121}My name is Sam Pischer.|I'm stationed in the Galápagos Islands.
{40125}{40171}And we stop. It's like musical chairs....
{40192}{40282}Are you seeing this? What is this about?|What is this about?
{40286}{40320}Why is the script on the floor?
{40324}{40370}- It's upsetting.|- What's this about?
{40374}{40460}You're another person. You're Debbie.|You're Brian. Say those lines.
{40464}{40491}- I'm Vic?|- Say her lines.
{40495}{40521}- Say his lines.|- I'm Sam.
{40525}{40581}- Just a couple of words.|- We have to speak--
{40585}{40638}Well, I'm gonna talk to Jay.|I'm gonna get him.
{40642}{40682}- Lincoln.|- Yeah, yeah, Miss Brown?
{40686}{40776}- Lincoln, I need to talk to Jay right away.|- All right. That director dude, right?
{40780}{40812}- Yes.|- All right.
{40816}{40874}I'm gonna shoot this again|and there's no script.
{40878}{40937}I don't even want to know|what's happening. What?
{40941}{40976}Whitney wants to see you.
{40980}{41049}- I'll be out in a second.|- No, she needs to see you right now.
{41053}{41125}Okay. I'll be right back.|We're gonna continue this.
{41129}{41229}I want you to do some exercise.|All of you guys, you pick this up, okay?
{41233}{41302}- Let's go.|- I'm Mary Pat Hooligan...
{41324}{41447}- Jay? Here.|- ...l'm Irish and I'm a freaking lesbo.
{41455}{41514}- I just want to-- Hi. Hi.|- Jay.
{41519}{41547}So, what's going on?
{41552}{41613}Well, Philip Kuntz and Lane lverson|both have a problem.
{41617}{41676}- Koontz.|- Koontz.
{41704}{41791}We were a little bit disturbed when|we saw you throw the script on the floor...
{41795}{41856}...because the actors were asking|legitimate questions--
{41860}{41945}It was a way to motivate them.|It was a way to get them thinking:
{41949}{42008}- ''Oh, "spilkes," something happening.''|- Hey, look.
{42012}{42078}I don't want to throw the baby out|with the bathwater.
{42082}{42129}You'll get a wet, critically- injured baby.
{42133}{42182}That's not what|you want to put your name on.
{42186}{42210}- Good point.|- Well- put.
{42214}{42248}I think you've lost your minds.
{42252}{42306}I don't think you understood|what was happening.
{42310}{42371}Those exercises,|the things we were doing, the thing--
{42376}{42431}You need to light a fire under an actor--
{42435}{42487}It seemed like you were|dodging the questions...
{42491}{42547}...the legitimate questions|the actors were asking.
{42551}{42602}- Lane?|- You were saying, ''I don't really know.''
{42606}{42642}Didn't say it out loud. In here.
{42646}{42721}''I don't know, but I'll have them|walk in a circle and change hats.''
{42725}{42775}- But what about me?|- Lane.
{42794}{42857}I am not dodging your questions.|I'm trying to--
{42861}{42909}We're having a conversation here,|all right?
{42913}{42972}I'm just saying,|don't provoke the situation.
{42976}{43014}Me, don't provoke?
{43028}{43105}We didn't walk on in the middle|of the scene and say, ''Don't do this.''
{43109}{43138}- Yes, we did.|- We did.
{43142}{43174}Right.
{43238}{43266}Marilyn--
{43270}{43327}- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.|- Every time.
{43331}{43402}I'm sorry. I wanted to let you know|you're wrapped for the day.
{43407}{43487}- No, I have another scene.|- They just said that you're all done.
{43491}{43555}Of course they did.|Next time, they'll tell me.
{43560}{43598}I'll make sure they do. I'm sorry.
{43602}{43643}- And your name is...?|- Sam.
{43648}{43722}No, it isn't. No, it isn't.|That's not what I've been calling you.
{43726}{43767}I know, you've been calling me Brian.
{43772}{43814}- Because your name is Brian.|- It's Sam.
{43818}{43903}I'm so sorry, Sam. I love you.|I love--!
{43907}{43940}- Sam.|- Sam! I love Sam!
{43944}{43968}Thank you.
{43972}{44013}- Sorry, Sam.|- It's okay.
{44017}{44075}You work the computers|in the AD wagon, I've noticed.
{44079}{44130}- Yes.|- So you know about these movie sites...
{44134}{44198}...where they go to sets|and talk about them on computers.
{44202}{44246}- Sure.|- Why am I telling you this?
{44250}{44315}But it seems my name|has been mentioned...
{44319}{44369}...with reference to an Oscar nomination.
{44374}{44432}- Wow, that's exciting.|- Oh, big deal.
{44436}{44506}- That's exciting.|- But-- Yeah, so I just....
{44510}{44576}You might have known|or seen such a thing.
{44580}{44631}Would you like me to do|some research for you?
{44635}{44658}- lf you want to.|- Sure.
{44664}{44707}- Wonderful.|- I'll let you know tomorrow.
{44711}{44751}- Big deal, but if you can--?|- Okay.
{44756}{44784}- Say your name again.|- Sam.
{44788}{44827}- Sam. Thank you, Sam.|- My pleasure.
{44831}{44863}- Thank you, Sam.|- Okay.
{44868}{44899}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{44903}{44983}Oscar. It would be in reference to Oscar.|Are you still there, Sam?
{44987}{45031}- I'm here. I'll look it up. Oscar.|- Okay.
{45036}{45059}- Wonderful.|- Great.
{45064}{45115}- lf you can. Not a big deal. Who cares?|- Okay.
{45262}{45351}Oh, Marilyn, wow. Okay.
{45362}{45451}No, stop it. Stop it, dear.|Let it go, let it go.
{45463}{45519}Don't think about it.
{45553}{45620}Oh, an Oscar. Oh, okay.
{45624}{45722}No, thank you. Just-- I just love the work.
{45726}{45796}It's enough for me. It really is.|It really is. Really is.
{45800}{45860}It's enough. It's enough. It's plenty.
{45864}{45939}Oh, God, it's plenty.|You're lucky to be alive.
{45971}{46038}{y:i}And now, Chuck Porter and Cindy Martin.
{46042}{46109}Well, the much- awaited,|star- studded Hollywood epic...
{46113}{46170}{y:i}...The Pride of Plymouth Rock|opens soon...
{46174}{46261}...and this is one film every patriotic|American has been waiting for.
{46265}{46296}I'll tell you what, Chuck.
{46300}{46379}Its two megastars,|Cynthia Chapman and Jim Beyman...
{46383}{46439}...may command the highest salaries|in Hollywood...
{46443}{46562}...but can all that money buy them|a coveted Best Actor and Actress award?
{46668}{46735}Oh, look, Daniel.
{46744}{46833}Gaze upon this bountiful|and beauteous place.
{46846}{46902}The Lord hath surely guided us|to this New World...
{46906}{47015}...so that we may till its fertile soil|and plant the seeds of a new life.
{47021}{47111}Oh, Daniel, let us seize|this glorious moment, now and forever...
{47116}{47200}...and commit ourselves to do his service|and to love each other, you and I.
{47264}{47311}I love you, Sarah.
{47327}{47362}And I you.
{47441}{47536}{y:i}Wow, well, I say, dust off the mantle,|{y:i}Jim and Cynthia.
{47540}{47584}{y:i}This could be your year.
{47588}{47662}{y:i}That film has a budget of almost|{y:i}300 million.
{47666}{47771}{y:i}My gosh, just how much does|{y:i}a funny- looking hat cost anyway?
{47813}{47884}- Liz.|- Hey! Hi!
{47916}{47977}You look so good.|I'm so glad you could make it tonight.
{47981}{48018}- Oh, me too.|- Thank you.
{48022}{48081}I finally get off early and you're here.|I'm so happy.
{48085}{48162}- You look beautiful.|- Oh, thank you.
{48218}{48312}Thanks. You know, I'm glowing|because I have very big news.
{48316}{48340}What?
{48344}{48439}First, you're never gonna guess|who I ran into today.
{48447}{48527}I went to Shoe Barn|because I wanted to get a strappy sandal...
{48531}{48605}...something open- toed and kind of sexy,|kind of loose.
{48609}{48698}And you'll never believe|who was the salesman.
{48707}{48736}Take a wild guess.
{48755}{48787}Your gynecologist.
{48804}{48910}No. Zach. From "Sisters of Stone?"
{48915}{48962}- Remember?|- I'll never remember, but go on.
{48966}{49039}He's running naked through tombstones.|He finds out he's gay.
{49044}{49105}- It's a full moon and he--|- Sort of. Is he still acting?
{49109}{49211}No, he's selling shoes,|but we just had this incredible connection.
{49215}{49262}He was cradling my instep|and looked me in--
{49267}{49302}Oh, the one with the breath.
{49315}{49369}The one with the breath.|How was it today?
{49373}{49451}He'd have to have had his guts removed|and his teeth to have it better.
{49456}{49504}- Does he still stink?|- He doesn't, he's fine.
{49508}{49544}God, that was the smell of sin.
{49559}{49651}It was. But he's-- So he looks good?
{49665}{49727}Yeah. Yeah, he looks good.
{49732}{49783}Well, he was at your feet.
{49806}{49847}Not up....
{49851}{49910}It's a good thing|he's not a hat salesman.
{49947}{50018}I had some wonderful news today too.
{50057}{50095}What?
{50113}{50155}What is it?
{50196}{50251}I think I might get nominated|for an Oscar.
{50255}{50366}Oh, my God! Oh, my....|Oh, my God.
{50370}{50436}- Oh, my God.|- Yes!
{50516}{50558}I could see it. I could see us.
{50568}{50618}A little piece of land,|far away from here...
{50622}{50675}...you teaching acting class|somewhere in town--
{50679}{50737}- No, that's too far.|- What?
{50741}{50801}The fantasy had gone too far?
{50968}{51015}It wasn't the apple in the tree...
{51019}{51115}...but the pear on the ground|that caused all the trouble.
{51126}{51150}Morning, kids.
{51154}{51198}- Hi, Corey.|- Hi, Corey.
{51226}{51274}- Big day?|- For her it is.
{51278}{51324}She shoots her big scene with Marilyn.
{51354}{51390}Big day for all of you.
{51395}{51498}No. I have, like, two exteriors with Victor|and then I'm done.
{51570}{51606}You haven't heard the rumor?
{51638}{51662}No.
{51700}{51792}Do you kids like to use|the World Wide ''lnterweb''?
{51796}{51831}The Internet?
{51908}{51936}- It's the Internet.|- Yep.
{51940}{51974}We do. We know what it is.
{51978}{52076}Well, there was an item|published on the--
{52080}{52116}Internet.
{52120}{52239}--and it mentions very favorably|this little picture...
{52256}{52348}...and in particular, your colleague,|Marilyn Hack.
{52374}{52408}- Good for her.|- That's so great.
{52412}{52547}In further ''particularlyness,''|a possible Oscar nomination.
{52556}{52590}- For Marilyn?|- For Marilyn Hack.
{52594}{52618}That's so cool.
{52623}{52667}- For "Home for Purim?"|{y:i}- Home for Purim.
{52671}{52730}- That's great.|- That's great for her.
{52751}{52795}Chew upon that.
{52799}{52853}- See you, Corey.|- Yup.
{52880}{52935}--days in this scene...|- Oh, my, this is too much.
{52939}{52993}- ...I need to know the script count....|- Too much.
{52997}{53040}What? What do you have?
{53044}{53135}I told you there was a blurb|on the Internet.
{53140}{53174}- Oh, did you get it?|- I did.
{53178}{53259}- Tell me.|- That lovely AD printed it off.
{53264}{53303}- They can do that now.|- On his own!
{53308}{53352}- On some connection?|- He has a machine...
{53356}{53420}- ...and a cord right out of his computer.|- To a printer?
{53424}{53462}- Yeah. Yeah.|- Amazing.
{53466}{53530}And now I have it here on paper.|Real paper.
{53540}{53591}It's short, but it's powerful.
{53596}{53634}''Marilyn shines in "Home for Purim."
{53638}{53691}The role of Esther,|like her biblical namesake...
{53696}{53747}...is laden with the riches|of complexity...
{53752}{53837}...and guilt as old as the parchment|on which the Purim story was written.
{53841}{53890}- Yes?|- In the hands of anyone less capable...
{53899}{53952}...the casting would be criminal.
{53956}{54028}But Marilyn Hack is delivering a performance|sculpted by tools...
{54032}{54109}...in whose hands only the most|experienced craftsmen should handle...
{54113}{54202}...a performance that could only be|described as Oscar- worthy.''
{54206}{54288}Hello. Well, how about|getting it right, for once?
{54292}{54323}- It's very nice.|- It's crazy.
{54328}{54370}He's right. I could have written that.
{54374}{54412}- Did you?|- I could have.
{54416}{54459}Could have been your nocturnal labors.
{54464}{54529}What's my nom de plume?|Remind me.
{54537}{54617}It's just a bit silly about the Oscar stuff,|don't you think?
{54621}{54679}Silly? It's the backbone of this industry.
{54683}{54730}An industry noted|for not having a backbone.
{54735}{54792}The problem is, there's not enough|pageantry anymore.
{54796}{54841}People want pizzazz,|they want pageantry.
{54845}{54930}They want more red carpet, not less.|And what's wrong with that?
{54965}{55054}And settle in. Roll sound. Okay. Rain up.
{55116}{55181}And action.
{55258}{55368}The air is as heavy|as a magnolia blossom...
{55375}{55493}...with the weight of a thousand teardrops|on its petal.
{55526}{55670}If you're waiting for forgiveness, Rachel,|I don't believe I can muster the strength.
{55681}{55756}It don't much matter now, Mama.
{55807}{55907}It don't much matter who forgives who.
{55991}{56035}What?
{56073}{56143}What did I do that was so wrong?
{56148}{56215}Wanting my daughter to grow up|to be a mama of her own...
{56219}{56271}...with a houseful of babies|and a decent man...
{56275}{56336}...to cherish and take care of?
{56340}{56405}You just didn't want the boys around,|Rachel.
{56409}{56467}What kind of girl|doesn't want to meet a nice fella?
{56488}{56575}I only invited the best ones over,|the ones whose daddies were professionals.
{56595}{56652}There wasn't a nebbish in the group.
{56656}{56725}But you wouldn't have it.|You wouldn't have any of it.
{56795}{56847}And so you ran.
{56852}{56938}You ran and tore a chapter|out of your family's life...
{56955}{57016}...and a piece out of my heart.
{57032}{57119}I was screaming, Mama,|but you couldn't hear me.
{57131}{57191}And you couldn't see me|for who I was.
{57196}{57271}I didn't want your life.|I didn't wanna be in a kitchen...
{57275}{57362}...with the brisket or the fish balls|or the kreplach or the "kugel..."
{57366}{57438}...or go out with boys that turn into men|I don't want to marry.
{57442}{57478}It was all "fershteit."
{57488}{57531}I am not you, Mama.
{57563}{57692}I am me, Rachel Pischer.
{57710}{57811}And, oh, yes, I did meet a nice fella.
{57840}{57919}Her name is Mary Pat.
{58047}{58134}"Oy gevalt," what have I done?
{58353}{58399}- Hi, kids.|- Hi, Corey.
{58403}{58473}Excuse me. Miss Hack, Miss Hack,|permission to speak with you?
{58477}{58552}- Of course. How are you on this fine day?|- I'm very well, thank you.
{58556}{58643}I just got off the phone with|the segment producer from "Wake Up L.A."
{58648}{58727}Guess who they want on their show|tomorrow morning.
{58731}{58826}- Oh, Corey, you think you're ready?|- No, not me. You.
{58852}{58884}- Marilyn Hack.|- No.
{58888}{58940}You and Victor Allan Miller.
{58959}{59026}- Oh, Corey.|- Yeah. Yeah.
{59076}{59158}You have no idea how difficult it has been|to get people on the phone.
{59163}{59195}- It was worth it.|- Thank you.
{59200}{59238}Corey, good job.
{59242}{59289}See what a little buzz|can do in this town?
{59293}{59394}Just a little bit of buzz, a little bit of|fairy dust and...you're off to the races.
{59443}{59537}Oh, Victor, incidentally, those radio|auditions have been changed to Friday.
{59541}{59595}What do you mean, auditions?|Hold on.
{59600}{59647}- A banana and water, please.|- All right.
{59651}{59676}- You?|- I don't audition.
{59680}{59743}- I'm gonna have the corned beef.|- Thank you.
{59747}{59817}You told me I don't have to|read for commercials. You said that.
{59821}{59898}I told them that. I said,|''My client should not have to read for this.
{59902}{59956}I think he's proven himself|time and time again.''
{59960}{60040}- Excellent. So I've got the gig?|- Well, if you read for it.
{60044}{60086}- Why--?|- I think reading is important.
{60090}{60152}I don't understand why,|after 40 years in the business...
{60156}{60250}...I have to read for a freaking radio|commercial in freaking Oregon.
{60254}{60345}Victor, if you go in and audition, okay,|what you're saying to these guys is:
{60349}{60431}''Hey, fellas, I know I don't have to|audition for this, but you know what?
{60435}{60544}I'm going to audition for it, just to show you|why I shouldn't have to audition for it.''
{60548}{60631}Just do me a favor. Let me be|the last person in, if I'm going to do this--
{60636}{60687}- Gentlemen, pardon the interruption.|- Hi, Corey.
{60692}{60788}Victor, the booking.|Tomorrow morning. "Wake Up L.A."
{60792}{60862}- "Wake Up L.A." for Victor?|- For Victor Allan Miller.
{60866}{60913}- Which is what?|- Which is a morning show.
{60917}{60951}"Wake Up L.A." Wake up.
{60955}{61050}- I don't have a TV, Morley, as you know--|- Doesn't have a TV. Cherish this client.
{61055}{61126}One hour infotainment. Variety.|Cohosts: male, female.
{61131}{61191}Happy addition tomorrow morning,|you and Marilyn Hack.
{61200}{61239}- Victor, fantastic.|- Congratulations.
{61244}{61271}Thank you, Mr. Miller.
{61275}{61336}This ship's turning around.|Thought you'd like to know.
{61340}{61388}That is so fantastic.
{61392}{61450}{y:i}- Wake Up L.A.|- Did I not say--? Am I a mind reader?
{61454}{61523}- What do you mean?|- "Home for Purim." I predicted it.
{61528}{61580}I said, ''This is the one.|This is the vehicle.''
{61584}{61621}Morley, you told me not to do it.
{61659}{61742}And so a high of 79 in Los Angeles|with a low of 67.
{61746}{61827}Long Beach is 77 and a low of 65.
{61831}{61943}Anyway, all around, it's gonna be|a pretty hot day and not very much wind.
{61948}{61995}Where does wind come from?
{62000}{62055}Where does wind come from?
{62074}{62115}I don't know. It just blows around.
{62126}{62162}That was a complete non sequitur.
{62167}{62237}We won't worry about it.|We'll go over to Skip and Sanchez.
{62241}{62316}Hello, Skip. Hello, Sanchez.|You look nice today, Sanchez.
{62320}{62361}Well, thank you very much, Monkey.
{62365}{62448}Oh, Sanchez, if only....|If only it was your hand and not Nina's.
{62452}{62505}- That's so rude.|- Get in line, get in line.
{62509}{62558}- He always does this.|- Good God.
{62563}{62679}All right. We've got a couple of wonderful|actors coming up on the show this morning.
{62683}{62758}Miss Marilyn Hack|and Victor Allan Miller.
{62777}{62813}You know, these two are good.
{62817}{62904}Very tough to do a morning show,|this chitchatty kind of thing.
{62908}{63027}But these two have an intellect|behind whatever it is they're doing there.
{63032}{63065}Oh, Skip's a good guy.
{63069}{63134}He and I worked on|"The Jerry Jeckel Show" together.
{63138}{63200}I can't speak for the painted whore|next to him.
{63220}{63265}Hi, hi, good morning.
{63269}{63327}In about 30 seconds,|at the end of this break...
{63332}{63374}- ...you guys are gonna go on.|- Okay.
{63378}{63457}Now, the seating arrangement|is Mr. Miller is in the middle...
{63461}{63528}- ...and Miss Heck is next to him.|- Hack.
{63532}{63603}- Okay, so I'm--?|- Right, so let me show you.
{63607}{63655}- Mr. Miller is in the middle...|- Yes.
{63660}{63717}- ...Miss Heck is next to him.|- Hack.
{63721}{63761}- She's on first?|- That's all right.
{63765}{63814}- As long as they have the name right.|- Yeah.
{63819}{63889}- And we're back. "Wake Up L.A."|{y:i}- Wake Up L.A.
{63893}{63985}- We have two fabulous veteran actors...|- Yes.
{63989}{64083}...that have joined us to talk|about their new movie, "Home for--"
{64087}{64110}- We want to--|{y:i}- Purim.
{64115}{64138}{y:i}- Purim.|{y:i}- Purim.
{64143}{64207}- That's a Jewish holiday, correct?|- It is a Jewish holiday.
{64212}{64284}It's a wonderful Jewish holiday.|Family, good triumphs over evil.
{64288}{64316}A wonderful story.
{64320}{64377}Victor, I want to tell you|that my family and I...
{64381}{64443}...we stop when your commercials|are running.
{64447}{64478}Thank you, that's very kind.
{64482}{64590}Does anybody out there know|Victor's day job as an actor?
{64595}{64620}- Let him have it.|- I do!
{64624}{64688}- Name of the character?|- This is on the tip of my tongue.
{64692}{64724}- It's the wiener....|- Yeah.
{64728}{64787}- Irv the Footlong Wiener!|- The Footlong Wiener, right.
{64792}{64842}Head of the class.|Told you I'd get one right.
{64846}{64903}{y:i}I wanted a wiener|{y:i}every time I saw your commercials.
{64908}{64943}{y:i}- That's the idea.|{y:i}- Fantastic.
{64947}{65003}- Good, good.|{y:i}- And you buy the hot dogs too?
{65008}{65090}Let me ask you a couple of questions|about "Home for Purim."
{65094}{65191}It's a story about a Jewish,|Yiddish family?
{65196}{65250}- Jewish family.|- Tell us a little about the movie.
{65254}{65301}- Marilyn, why don't you--?|- Yes, Marilyn.
{65305}{65396}I just would like a moment|to collect my bearings.
{65400}{65445}{y:i}Okay. Can l--? If it's okay with you.
{65449}{65516}{y:i}You gave a performance|"in" Song of "Reuben...."
{65520}{65562}Oh, she looks nervous.
{65566}{65630}She's too sensitive for this.|She shouldn't even do that.
{65640}{65707}You look gorgeous!|I'm calling her on her cell.
{65711}{65775}I swear, I'm calling her in 1 0 seconds,|when she goes off.
{65779}{65843}When they go to commercial break,|I'm calling to tell her.
{65848}{65916}Yes, Victor!
{65925}{65976}I don't act for trophies.
{65980}{66087}I think some people act for trophies.|Some don't.
{66091}{66162}- This is the range we don't see in actors.|- I hope I don't laugh.
{66166}{66236}Absolutely not.|Now, Victor, let me ask you something.
{66248}{66333}Because you are so distinguished|as the wiener...
{66338}{66442}...do you feel that people|are going to accept you in this role?
{66446}{66548}Well, if they've seen my theatrical work|over the years, I think they will.
{66552}{66656}Well, I have to tell you, for my money|and how I feel about it...
{66660}{66723}...I think you're looking|at an Academy Award nomination.
{66727}{66759}This is the woman, right here.
{66764}{66838}No, we know that, but I'm telling you,|I think you can....
{66842}{66899}- Did he just say what I thought he said?|- What?
{66903}{66984}Did he just say Oscar buzz at Victor?
{66988}{67047}He thinks there's gonna be Oscar buzz|around Victor?
{67052}{67083}- That's what he said.|- Great.
{67087}{67145}That's two Oscar nominees.
{67149}{67216}He said, ''Oscar'' and ''Victor''|in the same breath, didn't he?
{67220}{67274}- Yes, he did.|- Do you know what this means?
{67278}{67330}- The guy said Victor--|- The man.
{67334}{67397}- Has to be quiet.|- He thinks Victor's gonna be nominated.
{67401}{67442}- Oscar buzz.|- I need a Selectric.
{67446}{67534}- Let's send a big gift basket to Victor.|- I need to compose a very long letter.
{67538}{67607}- Oh, my God, that was....|- Oh, Corey.
{67612}{67687}- My infrastructure had a meltdown!|- No, no, you were perfect.
{67692}{67734}- Couldn't have done better.|- Don't lie.
{67738}{67772}- It won't help me.|- I'm not.
{67776}{67818}I didn't know what I was saying.
{67822}{67888}- Oh, I heard.|- How did he do it?
{67892}{67942}- Well, he's a natural, okay?|- He is.
{67946}{67993}You made him look good,|you were so stiff.
{67997}{68069}- I mean, you were a little nervous.|- Stiff? I should be so lucky.
{68073}{68119}- He was marvelous.|- But you looked pretty.
{68124}{68172}- She had a sexual feeling to you.|- Thank you.
{68176}{68237}I'm not used to being a sex object,|more of a food object.
{68241}{68295}- Get used to it.|- You play the actor so well.
{68299}{68344}- Congratulations.|- You had a quiet drama.
{68348}{68391}- That was wonderful.|- Sure, thank you.
{68395}{68451}- Do you know any, like, coaches?|- Come with me.
{68455}{68503}- Victor, go like this:|- Yeah?
{68541}{68582}You taste that?
{68614}{68665}That's the taste of stardom,|my friend.
{68669}{68758}You're entering a new plateau,|joining the ranks of a very select few.
{68762}{68804}I know,|I've seen this a hundred times.
{68808}{68866}I've guided so many actors|to this place.
{68870}{68946}You are now a star.
{68950}{69044}You have to start walking and talking|and thinking of yourself as a star.
{69048}{69076}- Okay?|- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{69080}{69151}Give Victor Allan Miller fans|the star they've been waiting for.
{69155}{69196}- Got you, got you.|- Yeah?
{69230}{69291}In today's ''Lost and Found'' segment...
{69296}{69405}...we're going to look at careers that|seemed to be missing for quite some time.
{69409}{69513}And wouldn't you know it? They both|turned up in exactly the same place.
{69517}{69643}Marilyn Hack made quite the splash|in "Song for Reuben" back in 1 989...
{69648}{69724}{y:i}...for her memorable portrayal|{y:i}of Imogene the blind prostitute.
{69730}{69818}Know what they say about blind prostitutes?|You really have to hand it to them.
{69822}{69864}We can cut that out.
{69868}{69931}But where did she go? She got lost.
{69936}{70010}And Victor Allan Miller,|the venerable Broadway veteran...
{70015}{70068}{y:i}...best known as|{y:i}Irv the Footlong Wiener...
{70072}{70147}{y:i}...in those amusing commercials|{y:i}for Felber's Kosher Hot Dogs...
{70158}{70202}...well, he just up and disappeared.
{70206}{70258}Until now, Cindy.|They have been found.
{70262}{70327}And I'm glad to report|they are not only alive and well...
{70332}{70375}...but more important, they're working.
{70380}{70471}I'll tell you what, Chuck. Both are|starring in the Sunfish Classics feature:
{70475}{70539}{y:i}Home for Purim.|And from what we hear...
{70543}{70611}...they could both be marching|down the red carpet this year.
{70616}{70700}And Cindy and I will be on the set|of "Home for--" How to pronounce?
{70704}{70735}- Purim.|- "Purim" tomorrow...
{70739}{70796}...talking to Marilyn Hack|and Victor Allan Miller...
{70800}{70883}...and the cast of this hot little movie|that seems to be creating a stir.
{70888}{70939}We'll have that story|and much more for you...
{70943}{71001}...on tomorrow night's show.
{71142}{71250}{y:i}When Achashverosh heard the news|{y:i}Of Haman's evil scheme
{71254}{71338}{y:i}He told his wife Queen Esther|"Don't" fabrent
{71381}{71487}{y:i}Haman will be punished|{y:i}And the Jews will all be saved
{71491}{71563}"And you'll" shep noches "later"|{y:i}In my tent"
{71612}{71710}{y:i}Purim, Purim, Purim|{y:i}It's a time to have some fun
{71714}{71825}{y:i}By drowning out the sound|{y:i}Of Haman's name
{71836}{71938}{y:i}Purim, Purim, Purim|{y:i}Spread the news to everyone
{71944}{72091}{y:i}That Mordecai and Esther|{y:i}Saved the day
{72260}{72296}- Let's get you back to bed.|- No.
{72308}{72394}My time is short|and I will not leave the Purim table.
{72447}{72562}What is it about Purim|that is so special to you, Mama?
{72584}{72658}I'm an Esther, like the queen.
{72664}{72757}She was a woman who came|from the worst of times to the best.
{72761}{72824}To a palace where she had|everything she wanted.
{72834}{72902}Comfort, riches, power.
{72906}{72963}And she risked it all,|including her life...
{72974}{73015}...to serve a higher purpose...
{73026}{73107}...commit a selfless act|to save a nation.
{73116}{73164}Your daddy was my king...
{73182}{73218}...this house, my palace...
{73227}{73332}...and my selfless act was to protect|my family from all the Hamans.
{73381}{73464}I don't have much time!|Let's put the toys down!
{73572}{73665}Only now do I realize the irony...
{73687}{73772}...that my selfless act|was indeed a selfish one.
{73795}{73884}Because the Haman I was trying|to protect you from, Rachel...
{73894}{73959}...turned out to be me.
{73986}{74015}Mama.
{74024}{74058}- Mama.|- Mama.
{74062}{74117}You're no Haman, Mama.
{74124}{74231}You are...Queen Esther.
{74340}{74398}- And cut.|- That's a cut.
{74402}{74475}- Very good, everybody. Very good.|- Thank you very much, everybody.
{74480}{74535}And we are moving on.
{74539}{74583}Scene 31 , in the kitchen.
{74588}{74627}- Simon? Simon.|- Yeah?
{74662}{74723}- Brilliant.|- Do me a favor.
{74728}{74834}In the next take, extreme close- up|of the kugel, all right?
{74838}{74882}Make a note of that.
{74886}{74922}I got it.
{74933}{74991}- To call attention to....|- I don't alter my reading.
{74996}{75066}That was terrific, unbelievable.|I loved that. That was great.
{75070}{75135}Victor? What I want to do is,|I want to come in low.
{75139}{75191}See your face after lunch.|I want to see your--
{75195}{75237}- Not too low?|- No, not under your chin.
{75241}{75288}Because I wanna be able|to crosscut after.
{75292}{75331}- Hello, everyone.|- And Debbie, who--
{75336}{75393}Everyone, quiet, please.
{75400}{75504}I have Martin Gibb,|the president of Sunfish Classics.
{75508}{75539}- Hi.|- Oh, hello.
{75544}{75601}- Victor Allan Miller.|- Hi.
{75605}{75647}- This is Marilyn.|- Hi.
{75656}{75699}- Marilyn Hack.|- Yeah?
{75710}{75802}- And this is the gang.|- I'm Brian Chubb. Nice to see you.
{75806}{75835}- Callie Webb.|- Hi.
{75880}{75921}The article.
{75958}{75987}The article?
{76003}{76044}Planet Earth calling.
{76048}{76096}Did you get a chance|to see the last take?
{76105}{76181}Yeah. Right. "Variety."
{76185}{76282}So ''Star on the Rise'' is the headline.
{76287}{76339}Okay. ''With stellar performances...
{76344}{76431}...from its veteran mainstays,|Marilyn Hack and Victor Allan Miller...
{76469}{76529}...it is the surprisingly adept|portrayal of Rachel...
{76533}{76603}...that could earn Webb|Academy recognition.''
{76713}{76752}- Made you happy?|- Oh, my God.
{76756}{76820}- Congratulations.|- Thank you.
{76863}{76910}- Oh, bye- bye.|- Wow, that's unbelievable.
{76914}{76981}- It's gonna be so much fun.|- This is good news for everybody.
{76985}{77066}- Bye! Bye, thank you for coming.|- Baby, this is fantastic.
{77188}{77235}I just feel like...
{77271}{77323}- ...I got in trouble.|- No.
{77328}{77378}- Like I don't know you.|- No. You don't--?
{77382}{77462}- You're mad at me for something.|- I'm not. I'm....
{77466}{77501}You're not happy for me.
{77505}{77554}I'm happy for you|because you do good work...
{77558}{77612}...and you're wonderful|at what you do.
{77616}{77696}You know how embarrassing|that was for me in there?
{77700}{77778}- You weren't happy for me.|- Listen, Callie, I'm happy for you.
{77782}{77845}- What is your problem?|- I don't have a problem. I'll--
{77849}{77899}- You're jealous. That's your problem.|- No.
{77904}{77998}If you're not gonna be there for me|then I will do this alone.
{78003}{78055}- I'm confused.|- I don't need you.
{78060}{78143}I don't need anybody.|I don't need you.
{78165}{78216}And you know what, Brian?|You're not confused.
{78220}{78282}- Callie.|- I see right through you.
{78286}{78377}- Come back here, please.|- I see right through you.
{78520}{78562}If you take my meaning.
{78566}{78629}Oh, good times, good times.|Well, done.
{78633}{78713}- Well done, everybody.|- We're very, very relieved and happy.
{78717}{78778}I mean, we had no idea, you know,|what to expect.
{78782}{78839}- We've never been here before.|- Babes in the woods.
{78843}{78883}It's great. The cast are great.
{78888}{78963}We make enough money on this,|there'll be babes in the trailers.
{78967}{79017}Hey, hey. Hey, now.
{79021}{79129}And so with a few little tweaks|here and there, you know....
{79134}{79174}What kind of tweaks?
{79178}{79253}Just make it more palatable.|We want a wider audience to see it.
{79257}{79299}We don't want a very small art movie.
{79303}{79348}Oh, I see what you're saying.|No, no, no.
{79352}{79419}I don't think you have that problem.|I've seen cut footage.
{79423}{79486}It's vital and it's exciting.|It's about real people.
{79490}{79535}Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we can--
{79540}{79628}It will be if we just tone|some of the themes down a little bit.
{79634}{79686}- That's all. Just tone--|- And how would that be?
{79690}{79734}- Just--|- What is the theme?
{79738}{79839}Well, the Jewishness.|Which is good. Ethnicity is good.
{79844}{79907}- Well, they are Jewish.|- Absolutely. Tone that down...
{79912}{79951}...and then everyone can enjoy it.
{79956}{80002}Wait. This is about a Jewish family.
{80006}{80051}They're home for Purim.|That's the title.
{80056}{80117}Well, we could--|Yeah, we could change the title.
{80121}{80190}I wasn't suggesting we change the title.|I'm pointing out...
{80194}{80287}...that Purim is an essential part|of this story.
{80292}{80342}It looks like guys in suits|are telling you--
{80346}{80382}- No, no, no.|- It's not that.
{80387}{80467}Just tone down the Jewishness|so everyone can enjoy it.
{80472}{80515}- Title change would be good.|- No one...
{80519}{80589}...is wearing a hat or has ringlets.
{80593}{80647}I'm just saying the film as a whole,|the theme...
{80651}{80691}...the whole thrust of the film...
{80695}{80769}...the whole in- your- face|Jewishness of the film...
{80773}{80822}...tone it down.|We could change the title.
{80827}{80874}Oh, here's people coming|to see it now.
{80879}{80960}It's a good film and there's people|watching. That'd be good, wouldn't it?
{80964}{81055}What if we do a different holiday|around the table-- Easter.
{81059}{81094}--and just focus on the rabbit?
{81098}{81196}All I'm saying is have it there,|don't shove it down people's throats.
{81200}{81250}I don't-- I don't run around--
{81255}{81326}I don't run around going,|''I'm a Gentile, look at my foreskin.''
{81331}{81393}I don't shove it down your throat,|because I don't care.
{81404}{81471}Three, two, one, and hit them.
{81476}{81506}We're sitting on the set...
{81510}{81588}...of one of the hottest movies|being made in Hollywood today.
{81592}{81635}It's called "Hello, Purim."
{81640}{81672}{y:i}- Home for Purim.|- No, "''Home.''"
{81676}{81708}{y:i}Home for Purim.
{81712}{81795}Some faces we're not familiar with.|Some new faces.
{81799}{81863}And I recognize Victor Allan Miller.
{81868}{81923}- How are you? Question for you.|- I'm fine, Chuck.
{81928}{81984}{y:i}The Brady Bunch.|What was your favorite character?
{81999}{82058}- Jan.|- Well, she's an attractive young lady.
{82069}{82128}Mine was-- I think her name was Alice.|Was that it?
{82132}{82206}She was the maid. She was the glue|that held the family together.
{82210}{82257}- You had a question, Cindy?|- Yes. Victor...
{82261}{82338}...when word got out|that I was interviewing you today...
{82342}{82403}...I was inundated|with phone calls and e- mails...
{82408}{82487}- ...all of them asking me to ask you...|- Knocked out by the opportunity.
{82492}{82538}- ...the same question.|- Which is?
{82542}{82594}Where the heck have you been?
{82598}{82669}Oh, aren't you nice?|Well, actually, I've been teaching in--
{82674}{82727}That's rhetorical.|You don't have to answer.
{82731}{82789}Marilyn Hack,|you play the matriarch here...
{82793}{82840}...and you are dying as I understand.
{82851}{82916}That must be tough,|doing a dramatic scene like this.
{82927}{83007}Let me ask a question.|Anybody play any gags...
{83011}{83055}...any pranks on the set?
{83059}{83114}Anything funny that happened?
{83138}{83203}No high jinks per se, but l--
{83208}{83299}Hold it just a second. I gotta take this.|Yeah?
{83303}{83337}- What's he doing?|- I don't know.
{83341}{83398}- Nothing much.|- Yeah, talk amongst yourselves.
{83402}{83450}- No, it was easy day.|- Hang up the phone.
{83455}{83496}Aren't these things wonderful?
{83500}{83583}In a restaurant, you can use them.|You don't have to hunt for a pay phone.
{83588}{83654}They say soon we'll be able|to use them on an airplane.
{83658}{83723}Callie Webb,|you had to play the daughter...
{83728}{83789}...that comes home to her mom|who is dying.
{83793}{83840}You have a history of standup comedy.
{83844}{83907}Were you able to fall back|on your comedy chops...
{83911}{83962}- ...in playing a role like that?|- No.
{83967}{84011}- It doesn't translate, eh?|- It's a drama.
{84016}{84097}Tragedy plus time equals comedy.|I didn't know if it worked the other way.
{84101}{84147}- It's a different movie.|- Yeah.
{84151}{84219}Years ago, I read a book called|{y:i}The Little Engine That Could.
{84223}{84260}- ''I think I can.''|- What?
{84264}{84311}''I think I can, I think I can...
{84315}{84359}- ...I think I can.|- That's what he says.
{84364}{84418}- That's what the train said as--|- I think I can...
{84422}{84479}- I think it was just three.|- ...I think I can.''
{84483}{84573}And it reminds me of this little movie|that started out as practically nothing...
{84577}{84628}...and is chugging up, up, up.
{84632}{84699}Who knows if it's gonna|reach its goal and explode.
{84703}{84749}It's a wonderful book.
{84753}{84835}It's big print, lot of pictures,|not too heavy reading.
{84840}{84930}If you want something heavy, see "Hamlet"|or Shakespeare or something like that.
{84934}{84989}For me, something you can|get into and out of.
{84993}{85059}God bless you all.|Victor, keep plugging at your career...
{85063}{85095}...despite what critics say.
{85099}{85160}You know, the dogs bark,|but the caravans move on.
{85164}{85258}Everyone, keep up the good work.|Tune into our show Friday night....
{85727}{85762}C.J. Simon...
{85767}{85828}...and a group of people|who stand around him...
{85832}{85906}...because there's no studio work.|Please get a name for your band.
{85911}{86003}Our next guest finished shooting|a charming little movie this past summer...
{86007}{86051}...that was just supposed to pay rent.
{86055}{86118}Here we are in January,|with the Oscars around the corner.
{86123}{86201}Let me tell you, that charming|little movie not only paid the rent...
{86205}{86257}...could end up buying her|the whole block.
{86261}{86298}It turned this town on its ear.
{86302}{86364}Please welcome the star|of "Home for Thanksgiving..."
{86368}{86444}...Marilyn Hack. Oh, Marilyn?
{86625}{86681}I love you, Marilyn!
{86727}{86804}- Well, good evening.|- Good evening, Ben.
{86810}{86866}Thank you very much|for being here with us.
{86870}{86923}Oh, no, thank you.|It's a dream come true.
{86927}{87031}Well, we're glad that we could|help you achieve your dream.
{87035}{87097}Speaking of which,|there is word on the street...
{87101}{87190}...that your performance in this movie|is spellbinding.
{87194}{87266}- Well....|- Tell me a little about the movie.
{87270}{87321}It's about Thanksgiving,|which I believe...
{87325}{87415}...is probably our most elegant holiday.|Don't you think so?
{87439}{87497}- I do now.|- Because we say ''thank you.''
{87501}{87555}And I, for one,|can't say thank you enough.
{87559}{87658}And it's all- inclusive. It includes|everyone, no matter what religion.
{87662}{87718}- It's nondenominational.|- Exactly, that's the word.
{87722}{87795}And it kicks off Awards season.
{87799}{87868}I gotta tell you.|I see a lot of films. I love all of them.
{87872}{87939}And "Home for Thanksgiving?"|I think it's my favorite film.
{87943}{87975}Favorite film of the year.
{87985}{88037}- Well--|- Oh, here we go.
{88041}{88076}--I hate to surprise you, Ben...
{88093}{88175}...but I also enjoyed it very, very much.
{88203}{88252}- You know, when people see--|- I slobbered.
{88256}{88303}I don't believe this.
{88319}{88371}- Well, thank goodness.|{y:i}- Home for Thanksgiving...
{88375}{88450}...is, as far as I'm concerned,|one of the top films of the year.
{88454}{88503}I mean, Oscars. I smell Oscars.
{88507}{88551}I loved it. I loved the movie.
{88555}{88618}KXBD 1 04.9 Talk Radio.
{88623}{88661}- Dinkie and Don--|- Turning you on.
{88665}{88741}It's the Morningwood Show.|Morningwood and Holly would if she could.
{88745}{88818}- I've got morning wood this morning.|- Yes, we do.
{88823}{88901}We got a special guest.|That's the reason for my wood, I tell you.
{88905}{88948}- Her name is Callie Webb.|- How are you?
{88952}{89010}- I'm good. How are you?|- Excited to have you here.
{89014}{89096}We heard there's a little bit of,|I don't know, Awards- season buzz...
{89100}{89159}- ...around the film you have opening.|- That's right.
{89163}{89207}- Tell us about that.|- I'm very excited.
{89211}{89259}The film is called "Home for Thanksgiving."
{89263}{89316}- And--|- How many topless scenes do you have?
{89320}{89370}- There are no topless scenes.|- No scenes?
{89374}{89416}- What's the point?|- How is there buzz?
{89420}{89450}But there's....
{89525}{89555}Gentlemen, welcome.
{89559}{89595}- Thank you.|- Thank you very much.
{89599}{89648}So here you are, playwrights.
{89659}{89758}How has the transition been from writing|for the stage to writing for screen?
{89775}{89842}Because it starts out|as a wordsmith's medium.
{89846}{89927}It starts out as a medium|in which your script is sacrosanct.
{89938}{90009}- Yes.|- Correct? And it's a medium...
{90013}{90092}...in the screen,|where the director calls the shots.
{90096}{90199}The director designs what's gonna go on,|the sequence of events.
{90207}{90305}The director, in fact,|can marshal your words around...
{90309}{90368}...and you're relegated.|Do you feel relegated...
{90383}{90434}...in this situation?|Or do you feel like...
{90439}{90504}...you have reached a position of comfort?
{90585}{90643}What up, everybody?|It's your boy, chillaxing.
{90647}{90687}We have a special guest today.
{90691}{90775}He's the star of the upcoming new movie,|{y:i}Home for Thanksgiving...
{90779}{90814}...which comes out this Friday.
{90818}{90868}I want you guys|to give a warm welcome...
{90872}{90943}...for Victor Allan Miller.
{90947}{91015}- Yeah!|- Yes!
{91091}{91142}- What's up, man? How you doing?|- How you doing?
{91147}{91227}- I'm so glad you could be here.|- I am so thrilled. I'm pumped, stoked.
{91231}{91302}Absolutely, absolutely.|Here on "Chillaxin'."
{91306}{91363}- We're gonna pump this beat now.|- So am I dancing?
{91367}{91463}Yeah, exactly.|All right, cool. Right there.
{91492}{91541}Let go a little bit.|That's what we gonna do.
{91545}{91615}That's what I'm talking about, chillaxing.|Let go even more.
{91619}{91656}- Let go even more. More.|- More?
{91660}{91706}- Absolutely.|- I'm a sandwich, huh?
{91710}{91779}- Just have a good time. That's what it is.|- All right, Victor!
{91818}{91870}- Yeah, right there.|{y:i}- Home for Thanksgiving.
{91874}{91955}Some love for him right now.|Victor, right now, letting go.
{92028}{92118}Well, the countdown|to Awards season has begun.
{92122}{92188}The nominations will be announced|in just two days.
{92192}{92274}And once again, we have to rely on|Chuck and Cindy's crystal ball...
{92278}{92347}...to give us the inside track|on this year's favorites.
{92351}{92424}Yes. We will gaze into the crystal ball...
{92428}{92514}...and tell you who we see|as our nomination picks.
{92519}{92576}Nice accent, incidentally.
{92580}{92650}Cindy, who do you see for Best Actor?
{92655}{92720}Well, I see two faces appearing, Chuck.
{92724}{92791}Ben Connelly|for "Whispers in the Attic..."
{92795}{92891}...and Victor Allan Miller|for "Home for Thanksgiving."
{92902}{92954}Who do you see|for Best Actress, Chuck?
{92958}{93073}I see Louise Mayer for the classy,|big- budget musical, "Dream Alley."
{93077}{93155}And there seems to be two other faces|fighting for recognition.
{93159}{93239}Marilyn Hack and Callie Webb.
{93243}{93287}Both for "Home for Thanksgiving."
{93291}{93326}Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.
{93331}{93411}Tomorrow night, the Best Supporting|Actor and Actress category.
{93415}{93517}- But right now....|- I see a commercial in the future.
{93521}{93586}And I'm feeling a lot better|about my accent.
{93779}{93815}Guess who. Hi.
{93836}{93872}Hi.
{93891}{93923}Hi, darling.
{93938}{93998}Do you believe this?|Do you believe any of it?
{94010}{94063}It's too exciting. How do you feel?
{94067}{94102}- I feel good.|- Oh, yes.
{94106}{94194}I don't see anything wrong with both of us|being nominated. Don't see why not.
{94199}{94254}I'm sure it's been done before,|don't you think?
{94259}{94327}I mean, after tomorrow,|I won't talk to you, but....
{94355}{94411}- Marilyn?|- Yes, it's exciting.
{94415}{94455}It's exciting, isn't it?
{94459}{94491}Yeah.
{94495}{94537}I'm so-- I'm very happy for you.
{94541}{94590}I'm happy for you too, Marilyn.
{94594}{94666}I haven't seen Brian here,|my other little baby.
{94695}{94742}- We split up.|- You did not.
{94746}{94780}- Yeah.|- Tell me you're kidding.
{94784}{94843}- Yeah, it's--|- That's awful.
{94865}{94907}Hello, blondie.
{94926}{94972}Are you a natural blond?
{94979}{95060}Oh, no. All of it|is really brown and curly.
{95137}{95227}Mixing business with pleasure.|My pleasure.
{95257}{95286}Yeah.
{95291}{95368}Do you like restaurants? You like wine.|Do you like restaurants?
{95407}{95443}- They're okay.|- Yeah.
{95454}{95491}Do you wanna go to a restaurant?
{95511}{95543}Maybe.
{95559}{95603}What sort do you like?
{95607}{95644}I like...
{95673}{95752}...''latesion''? Lesion?
{95770}{95841}Lesion, that's a-- That's like a wound.
{95845}{95921}No, it's Latin restaurants...
{95925}{95986}- ...but I don't know what the word is.|- Latin?
{95990}{96055}Latin restaurants.|You mean, like, Mexican or...?
{96059}{96141}No, Latin. The people that speak Latin.
{96158}{96197}I need this to calm my nerves.
{96201}{96254}- I'm not gonna sleep tonight.|- It's so exciting.
{96258}{96335}I'm a peeled nerve. I'm just--|I'm all jitters. I can hardly....
{96339}{96415}I think Marilyn is very deserving,|but I think Callie is equally...
{96419}{96455}...as deserving of an award.
{96459}{96510}She's wonderful,|but it's an early celebration.
{96514}{96559}I don't think she's quite ripened yet.
{96563}{96656}But you know what? I have to tell you|that when I was a very little girl...
{96660}{96714}...my daddy would say to me,|he said, you know:
{96718}{96771}''Never let them see you sweat.''
{96775}{96868}And I think that the voters|can smell the fear. It's like dogs.
{96872}{96913}They know that she's hungry.
{96917}{96994}No, but you know what? I'm sorry.|Dying is easy.
{96998}{97037}Playing a lesbian is hard.
{97041}{97128}Oh, please. Marilyn Hack is the queen|and tomorrow, there will be a coronation.
{97132}{97179}There was a thousand queens|on that set.
{97183}{97222}- And you know that.|- Your point is?
{97226}{97268}Oh, come on. There's a ton of queens.
{97286}{97359}It's been a good experience|for everybody. I mean, you know...
{97363}{97448}...this is the last bargain- basement deal|you get out of this guy.
{97452}{97502}You know?|We now have to be more discerning.
{97506}{97576}We're not gonna just take|any commercial that comes our way.
{97580}{97639}- We're not gonna take any.|- We're not gonna take any.
{97643}{97710}Gentlemen, "c'est ça."|Now, if I may go out on a--
{97714}{97756}- Jesus, don't touch me.|- Sorry.
{97760}{97824}Corey, what is it, Pioneer Days|at Moorpark this weekend?
{97828}{97903}Certified degree of Indian blood.|It's on my wall, "kemo."
{97907}{97986}Mr. Miller, I presume you will be|watching the nominations...
{97990}{98046}...this morning at 5 a.m.|on your television set.
{98050}{98126}Well, I would, except for the fact|that I don't own a television.
{98130}{98199}- Has no TV. Yeah.|- I'd be happy to telephone you.
{98203}{98259}Call me, Taft, and I will call him. Okay?
{98263}{98299}- We're having a meeting.|- Got you.
{98303}{98357}Could you step back, physically?
{98361}{98442}- Yep. I'm going to go sit in my car.|- Thank you.
{98460}{98499}Hello.
{98515}{98546}Hello, everybody.
{98557}{98594}Come around.
{98630}{98696}Come on. Okay.
{98711}{98744}Okay:
{98817}{98878}Okay. Thanks.
{98915}{99010}When the enchanting Whitney Brown|first came into my office...
{99040}{99131}...I realized I was in|for a very special encounter.
{99135}{99227}And when I actually got around|to reading the coverage...
{99231}{99329}...I realized I had in my mitts a story...
{99333}{99403}...the likes of which|I had not seen before.
{99415}{99458}Which goes to show...
{99462}{99543}...the suits aren't always the wankers|they're made out to be.
{99547}{99587}Hear, hear.
{99619}{99675}So with that in mind...
{99679}{99738}...I would like to propose a toast...
{99742}{99847}...to the future nominees|for "Home for Thanksgiving."
{99857}{99902}The future nominees.
{99906}{99942}{y:i}Home for Thanksgiving.
{99947}{100022}{y:i}Home for Thanksgiving.
{100247}{100334}{y:i}The backup, however,|{y:i}remains northbound at Costa Mesa.
{100338}{100449}{y:i}In Hollywood, traffic on the 1 01|{y:i}is running smoothly in both directions...
{100453}{100524}{y:i}...through the Cahuenga Pass|{y:i}and into downtown L.A.
{100528}{100583}{y:i}That is your early drive- time report...
{100587}{100653}{y:i}...and now we head back|{y:i}to our KAJE coverage...
{100657}{100730}{y:i}...of the nominations from the Academy.
{100734}{100851}{y:i}And now the nominations|{y:i}for Best Actress in a Motion Picture.
{100893}{100990}{y:i}Veronica Randolph|"in" Whispers in the Attic.
{101013}{101107}{y:i}Cynthia Chapman|"in" Pride of Plymouth Rock.
{101134}{101175}- Okay, say it.|{y:i}- Sally Ann Middleton...
{101179}{101247}- "...in" Whispers in the Attic.|- Say it now.
{101271}{101349}"Louise Mayer in" Dream Alley.
{101411}{101503}{y:i}And Monique LeBlanc|"in" Le Cheval Obscurité.
{101528}{101575}Dark Horse.

{102028}{102078}{y:i}- William Montague...|- It's so easy.
{102083}{102139}..."in" Tomorrow Never Sleeps.
{102803}{102871}{y:i}Hi, this is Brian,|{y:i}please leave me a message.
{102875}{102963}{y:i}Brian? Brian, it's Corey.|{y:i}Corey Taft and Associates.
{102967}{103029}{y:i}Congratulations, my young friend.
{103033}{103098}{y:i}You have achieved a nomination.
{103102}{103198}{y:i}That is very exciting news|{y:i}for a young actor....
{103227}{103328}Good evening America, and anyone else|who can understand the king's English.
{103332}{103418}Well, the nominations are in|and there are surprises galore.
{103422}{103510}Well, I'll tell you what, Chuck.|Once again, the voters have spoken.
{103515}{103617}And it seems that sentiment alone|will not get you that coveted golden statue.
{103621}{103703}And because there were so many surprises,|Cindy, I thought to myself...
{103707}{103782}...instead of hearing the usual drivel|from the glowing nominees...
{103786}{103831}...what could be more|fun than hearing...
{103835}{103950}...what the devastatingly disappointed|losers had to say this morning?
{103954}{104038}Well, I guess it all depends on what|your definition of fun is, Chuck.
{104043}{104078}Fun is where you find it.
{104083}{104168}We had our roving cameras on the losers|first thing this morning...
{104172}{104235}...and here's what they had to say.
{104294}{104342}Hi, Callie. Chuck Porter...
{104352}{104439}"...Hollywood Now." Scrunch over. I thought|you'd like some company this morning.
{104443}{104530}So let me start by saying...no nomination.
{104535}{104612}And I say that on behalf of myself|and all your fans.
{104616}{104675}Your movie was exceptional.
{104679}{104776}But what went wrong?|Why no nomination?
{104799}{104871}Honestly, Chuck,|I haven't really thought about it.
{104875}{104926}- No thought?|- It doesn't really matter.
{104930}{104999}It doesn't matter. Can I have an order|of humble pie over here?
{105003}{105098}For Miss Callie Webb? Don't say, ''Who?''
{105111}{105174}One thing you have to look forward to|is having privacy.
{105178}{105248}Not having people come out and say,|''Can I have your autograph?''
{105252}{105297}No autographs for this lady.
{105301}{105364}What do you mean|you didn't want one anyway?
{105379}{105476}Victor Allan Miller is inside auditioning|for a Buffalo- wings commercial.
{105480}{105543}Let's sneak inside like a fly on the wall.
{105547}{105604}Maybe they won't even notice|we're there.
{105608}{105674}Wow, that's spicy.
{105681}{105733}- Wow, that's spicy.|- You've sold me.
{105737}{105785}I'll take a thousand|of those Buffalo wings.
{105789}{105855}Because I got 500 buffalo|I'm teaching how to fly.
{105859}{105922}Chuck Porter, "Hollywood Now."|Would you all be an angel...
{105926}{105981}...and give us two minutes|with Mr. Miller, here.
{105985}{106025}- Hello, Chuck.|- How are you, Victor?
{106029}{106078}- I'm good, I'm good.|- Victor, listen.
{106083}{106162}You're striking|while the iron is cold, right?
{106179}{106240}I was shocked that you were|considered for a nomination.
{106244}{106306}But once the word came out,|I was rooting for you.
{106311}{106382}How did it feel when you thought|you were gonna get a nomination?
{106387}{106479}You know, when you just came in, I thought|you were gonna say there was a mistake.
{106483}{106549}I wish I could have.|There were so many great performances.
{106553}{106614}You know, I'm gonna call you Mr. Miller.
{106619}{106682}Because it's kind of hypocritical|to call you Victor.
{106686}{106734}- You get what I'm saying?|- I get it, yeah.
{106739}{106781}Victor, he's certainly not a victor.
{106785}{106839}Can I help you?|Are you a member of the union?
{106843}{106912}Would you tell your cameraman|I have to sign a release?
{106916}{106971}I'm kidding. Just get back there|and make notes.
{106975}{107078}We are out of here. We're in Times Square.|And we've watched this man's ball drop...
{107082}{107202}...ignominiously, so let's light the sparklers|and move on down the road.
{107210}{107279}I think we see Marilyn Hack right now.|Let's pay her a visit.
{107283}{107372}Morning, Marilyn. Chuck Porter,|from "Hollywood Now."
{107376}{107431}- Wrong house.|- No, the right house.
{107435}{107491}- I didn't get nominated.|- We wanna talk to Marilyn.
{107495}{107575}- Marilyn and trash. What a juxtaposition.|- I didn't get nominated.
{107579}{107615}We know that. And what happened?
{107619}{107660}- What was that?|- But the important--
{107664}{107704}You get close to being nominated.
{107708}{107789}- That's what it's all about.|- No, it's not right. It's a big tease.
{107793}{107890}Because four out of five of those girls|are gonna lose, bigtime.
{107894}{107936}- Can I ask you--?|- Way worse than me.
{107940}{107971}I didn't even get nominated.
{107975}{108050}- I'm not gonna lose. I'm not gonna lose.|- What happened? All right.
{108054}{108106}How could I think I'd win|if I'm not nominated?
{108110}{108170}- That's what I mean. You came this close--|- Stop it!
{108174}{108228}- I don't think you--|- I'm gonna go to France.
{108232}{108282}- What for?|- How'd the French girl get in?
{108286}{108357}The French movie. Drives me nuts,|with the writing on the screen.
{108361}{108458}- That's French. It's French. It's not legal.|- I don't think it's late- breaking news.
{108462}{108548}Then I'm gonna come back,|and they're gonna say, ''Oh, la, la, French.''
{108552}{108642}''French, foreign. You're so--|Let's give you all the awards.''
{108646}{108686}And I'll say, ''Fuck you.
{108691}{108750}You didn't know--  Even know it was me.''
{108754}{108831}- No. I'm sure-- |- Yeah, go see Frenchie.
{108835}{108894}No, I think they did a wonderful job.|Best of luck.
{108898}{108940}Come in. I got so much food. Come on.
{108944}{109015}Marilyn Hack. Now I know|what it feels like...
{109019}{109077}...to stare down into the Grand Canyon.
{109081}{109197}Chuck Porter, "Hollywood Now,"|saying, fade out.
{109385}{109482}{y:i}You were never there for me|{y:i}You never really cared
{109487}{109551}{y:i}I can see right through you
{109555}{109659}{y:i}You were always running scared
{109689}{109786}But wait. Were you there for him?
{109802}{109883}Did you give him everything he needed?
{109915}{110001}Maybe it was you|who was running scared.
{110183}{110243}{y:i}Wait a minute, wait a minute
{110247}{110315}{y:i}You're changing the subject
{110319}{110397}{y:i}I'm getting all confused
{110401}{110476}{y:i}He always was the problem
{110480}{110571}{y:i}I was being used
{110624}{110667}Or was I?
{110719}{110851}{y:i}Second chances don't happen every day
{110855}{110919}{y:i}But in every single way
{110923}{111000}{y:i}I will forgive him
{111148}{111205}Maybe I will forgive him...
{111259}{111311}...in hell!
{111667}{111707}What if I told you...
{111711}{111786}...that you could have a slim,|trim and sexy body...
{111791}{111837}...in just nine and a half days...
{111841}{111904}...and have all the fun|of a Hawaiian vacation?
{111908}{111942}Sound too good to be true?
{111946}{112026}Well, not when you're exercising|with Hula Balls.
{112030}{112106}And here to help demonstrate|this fantastic new product...
{112110}{112194}...a man who came this close|to getting nominated for an Oscar:
{112199}{112238}Victor Allan Miller.
{112255}{112284}Victor, welcome.
{112288}{112366}And congratulations on almost|being nominated. That's exciting.
{112370}{112405}Yes, it is. Thank you very much.
{112409}{112458}It was an honor|just to be almost nominated.
{112462}{112526}It's an honor to be demonstrating|this fantastic product.
{112530}{112590}Let me just show you|how easy it is to use.
{112594}{112657}Great. Now, to the untrained eye...
{112661}{112738}...it may look like Victor is having|the time of his life...
{112742}{112798}...but he's actually working|his abdominals...
{112802}{112875}...quads, calf and hip muscles.|Victor, may I join you?
{112879}{112911}- Please, do.|- Okay.
{112915}{112950}Plenty for everybody.
{112955}{113023}- God, this is as fun as it looks.|- Feels good, doesn't it?
{113027}{113072}- I'm feeling that burn.|- He looks good.
{113076}{113143}Good? He's this close from the A- list.
{113147}{113218}I mean, this is such a profile booster|for Victor.
{113223}{113287}Because you gotta be somebody|to sell these balls.
{113291}{113328}They don't just ask anybody.
{113332}{113390}More people will see this|than all the Shakespeare...
{113394}{113440}...and all the Broadway he's ever done.
{113444}{113497}He's gonna get a lot of work from this.
{113501}{113574}- I'm gonna need some help to get up.|- I'm right here.
{113588}{113685}You can't get away from us, Pres.|We're both in your blood.
{113706}{113817}This is the country you were born to,|the country you know and trust.
{113846}{113948}Amy wouldn't understand.|She'd think there'd be snakes.
{113952}{113999}Julia, please.
{114027}{114075}- That was good.|- Thank you.
{114212}{114262}- Not bad. Not bad.|- Thank you.
{114266}{114298}- But indulge me.|- Okay.
{114302}{114340}Okay.
{114427}{114470}Like I am.
{114474}{114547}You can't get away from us, Pres.|We're both in your blood.
{114551}{114655}This is the country you were born to,|the country you know and trust.
{114659}{114702}Your country, Pres.
{114735}{114815}Amy wouldn't understand.|She'd just think there was snakes.
{114819}{114864}Julia, please.
{114899}{114945}See the difference?
{115019}{115051}Was it louder?
{115096}{115156}Oh, my darlings, you are so talented.
{115160}{115202}That's why you're here, with me.
{115215}{115314}But you are so full of yourselves.
{115325}{115454}Ask yourself why the naked mole- rat mother|allows 30 babies at once...
{115458}{115539}...to grow inside her,|feed on her every resource...
{115543}{115623}...and stretch her skin|to the point of breaking.
{115647}{115742}I'll let you in on a little secret.|Because it feels good.
{115767}{115806}She lets it all go. Everything.
{115811}{115892}And she's left feeling comfortable|in her own skin.
{115896}{115957}Oh, I wish I could jump- cut you babies...
{115961}{116038}...right now to the happy place|that I'm in.
{116042}{116105}I wish, but that's your own journey.
{116109}{116154}It's worth it.
{116158}{116205}I have learned...
{116215}{116308}...that if I can expunge everything within...
{116315}{116390}...I am left comfortable...
{116394}{116455}...in my own skin.
