1
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,835
<i>In the city, you're nothing...</i>

2
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,907
<i>...unless you're part of something</i>
<i>better than yourself.</i>

3
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:42,108
<i>I joined a gang</i>
<i>when I was 10 years old.</i>

4
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>I loved being a gangster.</i>

5
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:47,290
<i>I loved my barrio.</i>

6
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:50,466
<i>Maybe that's why I became a cop.</i>

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,592
<i>With that power</i>
<i>came responsibility.</i>

8
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:57,186
<i>With responsibility</i>
<i>came opportunity.</i>

9
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,656
<i>And with opportunity</i>
<i>came corruption.</i>

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,861
<i>It was like the plague.</i>

11
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:05,308
<i>Everybody got sick.</i>

12
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,562
Hold up, Salim. Chill out.
There's somebody coming.

13
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,880
There's nothing to see out here, sir.
Go back inside.

14
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:36,993
Salim, kick back, homey.

15
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:40,957
You want a bullet in your head too?

16
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:44,699
Oh, you don't fucking hear me?
I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

17
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,740
-  In the motherfucking head.
-  Salim, damn it. Salim!

18
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:56,247
-  Undercover.
-  Undercover.

19
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,037
- Undercover!
- Undercover!

20
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:19,758
<i>I didn't give a fuck</i>
<i>about killing two gangsters.</i>

21
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,765
<i>That was our mission.</i>
<i>They were our quota.</i>

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,741
<i>Those were our orders.</i>

23
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,064
<i>I believed in what I did.</i>

24
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:32,958
<i>I believed in protecting the people</i>
<i>from the dirt on the streets.</i>

25
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:37,890
<i>I believed there was a difference</i>
<i>between us and them.</i>

26
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:40,609
<i>But man or animal...</i>

27
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,162
<i>...there are some lines</i>
<i>we should not cross...</i>

28
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:48,376
<i>...and my partner killed</i>
<i>an innocent man.</i>

29
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,512
<i>Still...</i>

30
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:53,689
<i>...I never thought I'd be a rat.</i>

31
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,774
<i>I love my partner like a brother.</i>

32
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:20,488
<i>And I love my unit</i>
<i>like my own family.</i>

33
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,338
<i>But after that night, I had changed.</i>

34
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:27,439
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

35
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>My conscience</i>
<i>was taking care of that.</i>

36
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,344
I know. I know it's a cliché.

37
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:40,508
- But they taste so good. Want one?
- Why you rolling up on me at my crib?

38
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:43,551
I think it's best
we talk in person, so hop in.

39
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:50,986
We need something else.

40
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,455
We need your partner
to corroborate your testimony.

41
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,258
- No, he ain't gonna roll.
- We need you to talk to him.

42
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,726
Look, I'll take a poly,
do whatever it takes.

43
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,751
Won't fly in court. You know that.

44
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,654
One more finger-pointing rat will.

45
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,978
Some finger-pointing...

46
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:09,033
...a little name-calling.
Should do the trick.

47
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:13,346
Some reason you don't
want him coming in?

48
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,670
He knows what you're doing...

49
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:18,034
...maybe he'll change his mind.

50
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,505
Today's the day.

51
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:39,150
<i>Guys like me</i>
<i>are what we always were:</i>

52
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,483
<i>Expendable.</i>

53
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,038
Elijah, did you clean
your room this morning?

54
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:08,849
- No.
- Go clean it.

55
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:11,906
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

56
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:31,035
Gotta go.

57
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:40,244
My son. Motherfucking superhero.
Catch any bad guys lately?

58
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:45,242
<i>-  Early tomorrow morning...</i>
- What's this?

59
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:49,479
<i>...we will take the children to the</i>
<i>forest and leave them there to die.</i>

60
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,368
Turn that shit off. Baby.

61
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,872
- Yeah?
- His mama's coming to pick him up.

62
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,108
- That bitch?
- Daddy, don't go.

63
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,223
Hope she gonna be
on time this time.

64
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,807
Don't forget your lunch.

65
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,357
Fucking asshole.

66
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,626
Can I suck your dick,
Officer Sancho?

67
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,711
Go put your uniform on.
Come on, dog.

68
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:35,006
Why you think we gotta
bitch up to them IA fucks?

69
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:37,254
Fifty to life a good enough reason?

70
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,916
Not to wear them fag suits.

71
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:45,118
You really want me to wear that?

72
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:48,358
I ain't getting in that ride with
you looking like that, man.

73
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,604
I ain't doing it.

74
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:54,721
I'd take a bullet for you,
cuz, but this shit?

75
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,859
Punk-ass motherfucker.

76
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:13,306
You owe me, cuz. You heard me?

77
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,866
Excuse me, sir?

78
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,990
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

79
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:46,505
<i>Seeing ghosts again, homey?</i>

80
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,908
A lot of ghosts in this fucking town.

81
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,839
Better check yourself today.

82
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,575
They'll Section Eight your ass.

83
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,574
What time they wanna
see you today?

84
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,383
- Six p.m.
- Yeah, me too.

85
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,776
I hope it don't take too long.

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,882
Gotta make me some money today.

87
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:12,225
Get me some rims
and a motherfucking Rolex.

88
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:15,358
Adel, your name tag's
on upside down...

89
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,595
...and you got a fucking
diamond in your ear.

90
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,155
I look good, though. Hear me?

91
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,466
So, cuz, one of them street ho's...

92
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:40,399
...hands over 40 quarters
to her pimp.

93
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,896
Pimp says, "Quarters, girl?

94
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,979
Which one of them niggas
paid you in quarters?"

95
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,500
Ho says, "Well, all of them,
they all done paid in quarters.

96
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,941
One at a time".

97
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:58,972
Just wanna make it through this day.
That's all I wanna do.

98
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:02,021
I just wanna stick my dick
in something.

99
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,406
You'd fuck a donkey
if you had the chance.

100
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,263
That's not very nice.

101
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,336
What's up, ladies?

102
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,569
You ever have a black and blue?

103
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:18,237
- You're a pig.
- Get out of here.

104
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,959
Go on, don't be mad.
We can make it, baby.

105
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,503
She just ran that light.
Crazy-ass bitch.

106
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,361
I should have
gave that bitch a ticket.

107
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,199
Nasty-ass trick-ass bitch.

108
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,886
What do we got here?

109
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:42,845
Oh, these motherfuckers are lost.

110
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,334
I'm sorry, we're lost.

111
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:48,401
You shouldn't be down here.
You don't belong here.

112
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,168
- Roll your window up.
- Directions?

113
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,981
Don't even think of helping them,
hear me?

114
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:59,718
Okay. Remember what I said,
it's a mistake.

115
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,183
- Just tell them--
- How can I help you, ma'am?

116
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,795
- What?
- I'm sorry?

117
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,222
- How can I help you?
- I'm having trouble with his accent.

118
00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:13,225
- I'm sorry-- No, Salim, come on.
- Looking for a restaurant.

119
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,093
- The address--
- Oh, shit, nigga.

120
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,596
- Sir, please exit the vehicle.
- Son of a bitch.

121
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,846
- What?
- Sir, please exit the vehicle.

122
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,935
Oh, you can't understand
my nigger accent either?

123
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:24,970
Get your punk ass
out the car, bitch.

124
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,680
Put your hands on the hood.

125
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,562
Hurry up, motherfucker.
Put your hands on the hood.

126
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:31,382
I'm not fucking with you.

127
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,127
Face down.
Don't be eyeing me and shit.

128
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,500
What is this? You don't need that shit.
Stay still, motherfucker.

129
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,883
What the fuck is this?
What you got in there?

130
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:45,657
You don't need that shit.
Don't move till I say move.

131
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:48,560
- Yes, sir.
- Don't "yes, sir" me. Just stay still.

132
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,368
Look at this.

133
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:58,778
All the bells and whistles.

134
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,711
Put your hands on the ceiling.
Put your hands on the ceiling.

135
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,236
What is that, seat warmers?
You got them too in there?

136
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,009
Come on, let me see.

137
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:14,428
Bet you like to take it
to the grocery store, huh?

138
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,355
Spread your leg.

139
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,625
Oh, shit, I know what this is.

140
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,600
I love the vehicle. You like it?

141
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:30,705
Can I--?

142
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:34,199
Do you like the motherfucking
$65,000 vehicle?

143
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,305
- Yes. Yes, I like it.
- All right, then. Get in it and drive off.

144
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:43,744
Hurry up, sir.
Ain't got all day in this motherfucker.

145
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,620
Go straight under the bridge,
there will be an on-ramp.

146
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,491
- Go ahead and hop on the freeway--
- Zero to 60 in eight seconds. Let's see.

147
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:56,281
Go ahead, I'm gonna
close my eyes. I'm not looking.

148
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,408
<i>Adiós</i>, amigo.

149
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,445
I hate white people.

150
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,462
Can we go now?

151
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,621
Hey, he was disrespecting you, cuz.
Liberal prick.

152
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:14,752
- They were Charlie. You know it.
- And you my motherfucking homey.

153
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,877
Got to soldier up, cuz.

154
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,086
Hey, look at this. Look at this.
It says "lawyer".

155
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:23,221
Look at all them.
Fifty names in there.

156
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:25,381
You know he was
into some dirty shit.

157
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,928
Craig Humphrey.

158
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:31,081
What kind of name is that for a nigga?
Humphrey.

159
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:09,029
Looking good, ladies.

160
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,870
- Check out these bitches.
- Sanchito, all in blue today?

161
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,973
- You know how we do it.
- This is <i>mucho</i> macho, <i>cabrones.</i>

162
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,709
- Going to the prom?
- If you're my bitch.

163
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,745
- Hey, watch it.
- Don't touch me, nigga.

164
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,279
- Oh, it's on now?
- Always on.

165
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,748
Come on, none of this.

166
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,530
All right, let's get going.

167
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,114
- Good luck today.
- Thanks, dog. I appreciate that.

168
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,314
- After you.
- Thank you, baby.

169
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,372
Before we get going...

170
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,814
...Officer Wallace
has something to share.

171
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,469
Tell your fellow officers
about your experience.

172
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:45,870
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:49,590
I was approaching
a somewhat hostile crowd...

174
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,711
<i>...surrounding a drive-by</i>
<i>shooting victim.</i>

175
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:57,615
<i>I noticed that the victim, some</i>
<i>gangbanger known as Little Angel...</i>

176
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,150
<i>...had his brains falling out.</i>

177
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,843
Where were you guys?
What do we pay you for?

178
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,984
And the mother was trying
to put the brains back in.

179
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,840
But the more she tried...

180
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,352
...the more they kept falling out.

181
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,868
It was like spaghetti or something.

182
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,570
Then she said,
"No wonder people kill cops".

183
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:31,345
Nobody in here feels worse for her
than Officer Wallace. Is that right?

184
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,868
Yes, sir.

185
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:37,511
- That isn't why people kill cops, is it?
- No, sir.

186
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,990
Why do people kill cops, Wallace?

187
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,242
Sir, because they
see us as the enemy.

188
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:44,999
- Because they distrust us.
- No.

189
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,618
It's because those people...

190
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:49,726
...are not people at all.

191
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,825
What's the difference between
us and them, Wallace?

192
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,685
- I don't know.
- Think about it.

193
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,047
- Officer Sancho?
- Sir.

194
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:03,357
- What do we do here?
- Sir, we fight fire with fire.

195
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:07,332
There's a war out there
on the streets.

196
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,027
And the blood
on that poor mother's hands...

197
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,690
...is blood on all of our hands.

198
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,852
Now, you go out there today
and knock heads with the enemy.

199
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,795
Make sure...

200
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,490
...the letters P-O-L-I-C-E is branded
on the head of every gangbanger...

201
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,669
...like a cowboy's branding iron.

202
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,857
Remember, you are the elite.

203
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:36,286
The chosen few.

204
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:41,591
One felon a day
is all you need to do.

205
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:46,350
Dismissed.

206
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:48,635
Fellas?

207
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,023
That's a sweet little story
you told there, rookie.

208
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,670
- Shut up, nigga.
- You know?

209
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,939
- You serious?
- Don't push my baton, nigga.

210
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,161
Who the fuck you pushing, bitch?

211
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:09,266
You're a rookie.
Don't forget that shit, motherfucker.

212
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,550
- Why you messing with him, anyway?
- Trying to heat the young kids up.

213
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,810
Know what I mean?

214
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,554
Bye, Salim.

215
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,394
Lieutenant, give us a minute,
will you?

216
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:26,446
- Sure.
- Thanks.

217
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:47,987
So...

218
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,546
...today is the day.

219
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,701
I can't tell you how much faith
I have in you two.

220
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,937
- Thank you, sir.
- You know how these things go.

221
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:05,303
Somebody on the outside
thinks they can do our job better.

222
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,140
They get upset
because we play ball.

223
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,041
But as long as crime
keeps going down...

224
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,599
...all we gotta do is ride it out.

225
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,127
And ride it out
is what we're gonna do.

226
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,752
- You can count on us, sir.
- Good.

227
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,624
You okay, Armando?

228
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,608
A little nervous, sir.

229
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:32,671
Look, I know only the best intentions
were behind what happened that day.

230
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,221
Mistakes happen in the fog of war.

231
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,177
You're a good man.

232
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,811
The world is a bad place.

233
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,304
You do the best you can
in a bad place.

234
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,147
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,947
Last week...

236
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,067
...more third-strikers
were put away by us...

237
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,600
...than any other division in the city.

238
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,577
Be proud.

239
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,856
Walk tall.

240
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,901
I'll take care of you.

241
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,464
Don't worry.

242
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,299
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,651
A man said:

244
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,814
"Someday a real rain's gonna come
and wash all the scum off the street".

245
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,398
Only, it don't rain in the desert...

246
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,385
...so we gotta do all
the scum-washing ourselves.

247
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,061
Nigga better get a life vest.

248
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,363
- Little hair of the dog?
- I'm a drunk. I'm always thirsty.

249
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,208
- See you in a second.
- Cool.

250
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,366
Right.

251
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,973
<i>-  Yo, captain.</i>
- Yeah.

252
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,052
<i>So how are the kids?</i>

253
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,788
<i>Bury them under</i>
<i>the fucking freeway.</i>

254
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:00,316
<i>-  What about the coke?</i>
<i>-  Don't worry, you'll get yours.</i>

255
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,132
<i>Yeah, man, pleasure</i>
<i>doing business with you.</i>

256
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,838
- What's happening?
- You know the drill. Come on.

257
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,359
Are we supposed to be
wearing a wire?

258
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,109
Bet this reminds you
of Valentine's Day...

259
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,278
...when your father would
make love to you.

260
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:32,213
- Quit your bitching, pussy.
- Fuck you.

261
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,416
You got a problem with it?
Talk to the man.

262
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,286
Come on.

263
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,249
What time are you guys meeting IA?

264
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,856
- 1800.
- What did the captain tell you?

265
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,157
He said to stay away from
corrupt motherfuckers like you.

266
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,403
Got your stories straight?

267
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:59,107
We in the loop. Don't worry about us.
We know what's happening, you know?

268
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,942
So, what do you got planned
for the rest of the day?

269
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,555
Same old, same old.

270
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,679
Got a little time for
a little ring-a-ding, then?

271
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:09,648
For sure.

272
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,835
I don't think so.

273
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,512
Do you know
the definition of opportunity?

274
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,331
No?

275
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:35,751
Opportunity: A favorable
juncture of circumstances.

276
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,749
Or, let's see,
another one would be...

277
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,802
...if you like, a good chance
for advancement of progress.

278
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,437
You understand that?

279
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,763
Opportunity:

280
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,716
Advancement of fucking progress.

281
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,711
Lieutenant?

282
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,369
Excuse me.

283
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,304
Yeah.

284
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,349
Yeah.

285
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:10,835
All right, good.

286
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,678
- Perfect.
- "I don't think so," motherfucker?

287
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,818
Embarrass me in front
of the lieutenant like that?

288
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,393
Hey, don't think for us.

289
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,123
What the fuck we doing here?
What we doing?

290
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,584
All right. Okay.

291
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:26,824
Try me.

292
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:32,943
Well...

293
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,931
- ...what do you think?
- We're in.

294
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:45,559
All right.
That's what I like to see, kid.

295
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:50,384
- Well, to good living.
- That's what I'm talking about.

296
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:51,815
Cheers.

297
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:57,525
Now, here's the deal.

298
00:22:57,525 --> 00:23:01,098
There's a guy named Brax
who's been reaching out to us.

299
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:04,574
I know Brax. That's Damian Baine's
right-hand man.

300
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:06,847
<i>Nigga owns</i>
<i>every night club in town.</i>

301
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,497
Well, he's got some scam
that he's in a real hurry to get done.

302
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:13,163
- You guys cool with that?
- Cool.

303
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:18,390
I can set up a meeting between you
and him at this Mexican joint, all right?

304
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:23,106
Now, there's 13 keys...

305
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:26,186
...of the most pure shit
you ever seen...

306
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,741
...sitting downtown in Evidence
with your names written all over it.

307
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,012
We get these 13 keys to Baine...

308
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:35,033
...who's responsible
for getting it back?

309
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,495
Who the fuck do you think?

310
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,085
I almost forgot, shit.

311
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:46,143
I got you guys...

312
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:48,876
...courtside seats
to the playoffs tonight.

313
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:52,309
- What?
- So make it quick at IA, understand?

314
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,483
- You guys are gonna have fun.
- That's what's up.

315
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:56,923
You know what I mean?

316
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:00,150
You guys enjoy the game.

317
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:11,977
Nigga, I've never been
courtside to the playoffs before.

318
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:16,153
What? I ain't never even
been to the playoffs before, shit.

319
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,974
Why would that cheap motherfucker
give us free tickets to the playoffs?

320
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:22,345
I don't know.

321
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:26,146
But it says something that he's coming
to us and not that wetback.

322
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:27,517
Know what I mean?

323
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,418
Man, it's just a fucking game,
that's all it is.

324
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:34,298
Hey, don't stick your dick
in the gift horse's mouth.

325
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,129
All right? It means something.
You heard me?

326
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,712
Sir. Today's the day, my nigga.

327
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:43,336
We on the come up.
We coming up.

328
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:47,417
I don't like it, Salim.

329
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:50,240
Take a leg up when you get it, shit.

330
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:53,306
Why in the hell would anybody
give us a leg up?

331
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,408
- To show trust in us.
- Trust in us.

332
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:58,288
Hey, man, we get in with Baine,
we get rich. Hear me?

333
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,680
Pretty quick to get on that
Baine program.

334
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,065
Don't hate the player,
hate the game, cuz.

335
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,674
You know the deal.

336
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:39,570
You're Officer Sancho?

337
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,012
Do I look Mexican? It's my partner.

338
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:47,327
- Your badge is upside down.
- It's been one of them mornings.

339
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,909
- Hey, beautiful.
- Officer Sancho?

340
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,472
Yeah.

341
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:57,694
- Something wrong, officer?
- Yo, cuz, we in a hurry.

342
00:25:58,371 --> 00:25:59,766
Yeah, well, I'm not.

343
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:03,175
So give me a minute while I call
the requesting judge, okay?

344
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,808
Sir? Sir.

345
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:13,356
Listen, we're late,
our job's on the line.

346
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,775
We really need to get going.

347
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:18,958
You wouldn't want another
dealer on the street...

348
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,028
...ifwe're fucking late, would you?

349
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,256
Motherfucking candy store.

350
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:47,927
Toxicology was here earlier...

351
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,723
...ran a test sample,
so no funny stuff.

352
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:51,954
No funny stuff.

353
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:55,017
You. Sign that.

354
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:01,388
Had more than a few pieces
of evidence disappear...

355
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:03,803
...after being checked out
by your division.

356
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:05,783
Zip that up. This gets back by 5.

357
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:13,055
- I'll take that.
- Follow procedure, officers, 5:00.

358
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:21,353
What the fuck
was that shit about back there?

359
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:24,046
- What?
- My name on the slip, that's what.

360
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,893
- What name you want?
- How about your own?

361
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:30,043
- Why mine, bitch?
- Well, it's your fucking gig, ain't it?

362
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,999
Oh, no, fuck that. We partners, man.
We in this together.

363
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,460
As always.

364
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,981
You got something to say? Say it.

365
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:39,782
Fuck it. Say it, motherfucker.

366
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,382
Yeah, I thought so.

367
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:17,179
Watch my back, cuz,
while I check this nigga.

368
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:25,194
Hey, what's up, bro?

369
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,907
Same old, same old.

370
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:33,552
Salim Adel.

371
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,688
You in here sorting through
the little table full of niggas?

372
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:41,374
What you looking for? You ain't come
in here to do the black man harm?

373
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,754
- Friendlies in blue, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

374
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:48,049
Salim Adel
in a fucking faggot suit.

375
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,495
And your mother, how is she?

376
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,409
Not very well, not very well.

377
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:54,102
I am sorry.

378
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,224
You ain't the only one
sucking dick, selling rock.

379
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,307
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.
- What?

380
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,913
Hey, there ain't gonna
be no disrespect.

381
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,346
No disrespecting.

382
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:08,134
I ain't disrespecting you, cuz. We
played football together, remember?

383
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,961
Used to run with the same set.

384
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,516
Don't talk to me about no fucking
football, nigga. I'm a fucking OG.

385
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:16,501
I'm a ghetto superstar
and an international pimp.

386
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,021
I got fans all over
the fucking world, nigga.

387
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:21,005
True as a bullet in a pig's head.

388
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:22,997
Look, you need a busboy...

389
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:27,669
...to clean up all this fucking trash
in front of this place.

390
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:31,396
No, brother, everybody's got to eat.

391
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,175
If you say so.

392
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,073
Man, go into the car, nigga.
You, go to the car.

393
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,218
Yeah, I wanna talk
to this nigga by myself.

394
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:42,158
Everybody, get the fuck
out of here, matter of fact.

395
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,063
- See this shit?
- What the fuck is this?

396
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:46,998
That's one of them new joints too.

397
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:50,021
A Mark Xll or some shit.
Got all the bells and whistles.

398
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:52,537
High connectivity and shit.

399
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:54,819
So you get what you told?

400
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,516
- Thirteen.
- Let me see it.

401
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,808
No, cuz, not here.

402
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:02,821
Keeping it safe
until we know what we're doing.

403
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,385
You're a smart motherfucker, huh?

404
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:11,165
Hey, man, I'm in a big motherfucking
hurry, and I heard that you was too.

405
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,125
- So, what's the dealio?
- Tell you what the deal is.

406
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,770
You gonna be a rich fucker if you
shut your smart motherfucking mouth.

407
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,799
If you don't shut your
smart motherfucking mouth...

408
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,081
...I'm gonna walk out
on your punk ass.

409
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,192
All right, man. When and where?

410
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:27,749
Come to the club.

411
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,832
In the back. And bring the shit.

412
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,341
Today is the day, nigga.

413
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,328
You ain't gonna believe
this shit, cuz.

414
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,682
What? We're supposed to
go to Baine's crib...

415
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,572
...with the bricks in our hand?

416
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:42,754
Don't start getting
all paranoid on me.

417
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:45,123
We ain't giving them shit.
Staying in the car.

418
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:48,723
They said to bring the shit in.
Why we ain't gonna bring the shit in?

419
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,045
Baine got his drugs...

420
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:53,764
...lieutenant got his hands clean
for the murders.

421
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:56,257
There's no way we could
turn him in to IA...

422
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,601
...ifwe're both fucking dead.

423
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:01,435
What the fuck did you just say?

424
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,138
What the fuck you thinking
about saying to IA?

425
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,227
What the fuck you thinking
about telling IA, man?

426
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:12,007
- Nothing.
- You damn right, nothing.

427
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:15,066
Better check yourself for that shit.

428
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,426
What the fuck you looking
at me like that for?

429
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:23,461
What, nigga?

430
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:27,716
Why the fuck you be
disrespecting my friends?

431
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:30,934
They ain't your friends, nigga.
Leave the shit in the car.

432
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,666
Hey, hey, hey. Listen....

433
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,830
You gotta stop believing the hype.

434
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:40,344
Thinking that there's some
gang war out here and shit.

435
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,306
Well, there ain't. It's done.

436
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,245
Everybody's so rich off the narco,
they ain't mad-dogging anymore.

437
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,987
We the only gang that's left.

438
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:54,097
So wise up, nigga. Wise up.

439
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,309
You know, he invited us to Vegas.

440
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:04,722
Hear me? But he said,
"Don't come wearing your blues.

441
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:08,586
Because you ain't gonna get
your nut sack sucked that way".

442
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,749
We go see Baine,
the shit's staying in the car.

443
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:15,088
Let's not get jumped in, man.
This is our time now.

444
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,587
No.

445
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:21,919
The shit's staying in the car.

446
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,933
We hook up with Baine,
we're on top of the pile, man.

447
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:29,817
I wanna go to Vegas.
I wanna get my nut sack sucked.

448
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,613
I know you wanna get
your nut sack sucked.

449
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,592
How many nuts you think
a bitch can keep in her mouth?

450
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,796
Come on, man. Ho's got to eat too.

451
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:47,063
Don't look at me like that.
Ever seen me go off?

452
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,594
I only got but two.

453
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:51,549
Shit, not counting the one
in your asshole, that's three.

454
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:54,572
That's <i>tres</i>. How do you say that?

455
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:01,298
"Motherfuckos". You shit pesos.

456
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:05,571
That's all I'm talking about.
Vegas. Vegas, nigga.

457
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:10,160
The shit stays in the car. I don't give
a fuck how many nuts you get sucked.

458
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,715
I don't know how
to make it work. Keep that.

459
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,446
That shit ain't for niggas.

460
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,389
What's up?
You all dressed up, huh?

461
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:34,121
Are those real blue contacts?

462
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:37,845
Please, that real gold paint
on that bullshit-ass chain?

463
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:40,947
Don't fuck with Jesus.

464
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:43,050
Yeah, right.

465
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:46,166
Yo.

466
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,963
This is Brax. I'm out here with them.

467
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:52,403
We waiting for my man.
He got what we need.

468
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:57,107
We're good to go.

469
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,770
Armando Sancho.

470
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,643
For a long time I've heard
about the myth...

471
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,111
...today I meet the legend.

472
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:04,406
Mal Creado gang, right?
Back in the day.

473
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:05,298
Yep.

474
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:08,404
Yeah, some men talk the talk...

475
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,671
...but you walk the walk.

476
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:12,782
Salim Adel.

477
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,826
What am I seeing on the West Coast?

478
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,711
My motherfucking homey.

479
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:21,307
Thirteen keys of righteous dope.

480
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:27,414
Hey, girl.

481
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,171
Dancing is done.

482
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,871
If I was selling your pussy,
I'd be rich already.

483
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:35,237
Bad men carry python snakes, see?

484
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,513
Careful, she bites.

485
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,503
I bite too.

486
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:40,611
Go on, get out of here.

487
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:42,084
Yo.

488
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,042
Salim Adel.

489
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,890
You talk that loud again,
I'll assume you're an informer.

490
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,905
And informers get killed.
I have an opportunity for you.

491
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:54,564
There are some Canadian
Hell's Angels down at the beach.

492
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,834
<i>They are sitting on hundreds and</i>
<i>thousands of dollars. Maybe more.</i>

493
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:01,290
<i>They think they're big time.</i>

494
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,196
But crime is easy...

495
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:07,399
<i>...when you don't fit the profile.</i>

496
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,113
<i>They bring the chronic down</i>
<i>from Canada, flip the shit into coke.</i>

497
00:36:11,113 --> 00:36:12,823
<i>Buy all the dope in town...</i>

498
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,072
<i>...sending the prices sky-high.</i>

499
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,997
I have a huge problem with that.

500
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:19,858
<i>They're idiots.</i>

501
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,511
<i>They will buy coke</i>
<i>from anyone half-connected...</i>

502
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:27,046
<i>...and stupid enough to walk up</i>
<i>to the door and say, "Nantucket".</i>

503
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:28,968
Nantucket.

504
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,831
<i>They think this a vacation...</i>

505
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:35,256
<i>...but you don't ruin my business</i>
<i>on a vacation.</i>

506
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,429
<i>And a nigga's never on vacation...</i>

507
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,785
<i>...trust me when I tell you, because</i>
<i>a nigga always fits the profile.</i>

508
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:45,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

509
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:47,993
<i>Do you know what a 'j' ux" is?</i>

510
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,780
- Police.
- Don't move.

511
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:51,875
- Put them up.
- Make me do it.

512
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,834
Yeah, that's right. Thirteen keys.

513
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:02,284
So we use the drugs to get the money
and keep both?

514
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:05,360
- Sounds pretty easy.
- If it's so easy...

515
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,095
...why don't you just do it yourself?

516
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,473
I don't want any problems
with the Hell's Angels.

517
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:16,111
But if you make it look like a bust,
real pig action, cherry top popping...

518
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:19,874
...then we're all happy.
And the whole community is happy.

519
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:23,032
- Rodriguez and Sayed?
- No.

520
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:26,690
The lieutenant told me you guys
were the best for the job.

521
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,590
This has to happen right now.

522
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,960
These guys are leaving
for Vancouver tonight.

523
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,760
This has to happen right now.

524
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:35,247
Lieutenant made the call already.

525
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:38,900
They said they coming over
in about an hour.

526
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,335
What we getting paid?

527
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,997
We split the loot three ways.

528
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,458
Me, you...

529
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,325
...and me again.

530
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,940
Sound fair?

531
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,914
Hey, hey, hey. Relax, man, relax.

532
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,539
We got the fucking job, cuz.
We got the job.

533
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,030
What did I say?

534
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:22,511
- What did I fucking say?
- You said, "What did I say". Hey.

535
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,546
You said,
"Leave the shit in the car".

536
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:27,316
But you was wrong, man.
They didn't fucking jack us...

537
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:28,927
...they hired us.

538
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:34,352
We're gonna go back to the lieutenant
and tell him, "No fucking way".

539
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:38,153
We're gonna go to our IA meeting,
and then we're gonna go home.

540
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,685
And we're gonna survive.

541
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:43,237
You're scared.

542
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:45,770
I've never seen you scared before.

543
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,202
Yeah, maybe you should be too.

544
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,485
You don't think I know what's up?

545
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,992
All I know is they wanna get rich...

546
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,442
...I wanna get rich,
and I know you wanna get rich.

547
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,723
I'll tell you what you get.

548
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:03,595
You get got as soon as you
walk in that door.

549
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:09,958
Ifthey wanted to kill us,
they'd have done it already.

550
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,793
They'd have done it
at the motherfucking taco stand.

551
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:19,418
Man, you gotta chill
with the mind-fuck, cuz.

552
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:22,959
Your punk ass can't handle
the motherfucking pressure.

553
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:26,087
Now, get this
motherfucking gun off me.

554
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,548
What the fuck is wrong with you?

555
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:41,392
I mean, listen to me, man.
I'm talking hundreds of thousands.

556
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:42,770
Maybe even more.

557
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,959
I know you can use
some real money...

558
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:48,379
...instead of dealing with all this
little fucking weaselly shit.

559
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,928
What, you think I'm a dumb nigga
just because I wanna buy shit?

560
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:58,272
Doesn't matter
what you spend it on.

561
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,673
We both want it.

562
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,809
Shit, we both need it.

563
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:04,912
Fuck it.

564
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,381
We ain't got nothing
better else to do.

565
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:09,856
What we got, huh?
Not a motherfucking thing.

566
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:17,254
Man, we do this one gig,
this one motherfucking hit...

567
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:20,153
...nigga, we set for life,
you heard me?

568
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,418
I ain't gonna shoot anybody.

569
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,278
We go in there clean...

570
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:37,841
...we take the money
and we walk the fuck out.

571
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,303
Hey, I ain't looking
for no battle neither.

572
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:46,987
So from here on out,
what I say goes.

573
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:50,169
- You got it?
- Yes, sir, master.

574
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:51,352
Shit.

575
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:55,718
You say that shit,
or I'll walk out this fucking door.

576
00:40:57,898 --> 00:41:00,070
What you say go.

577
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,236
What you say go.

578
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,684
What you say go, motherfucker.

579
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:11,147
My nigga.

580
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:17,431
- Maybe today's the day after all.
- Good.

581
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,834
Let's go punk down
the motherfucker.

582
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,854
Thanks for coming, captain.
We appreciate your time.

583
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:55,519
Whatever I can do to help.

584
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,996
- Ready, gentlemen?
- Ready.

585
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:13,373
You testified that the two young men
killed by your officers...

586
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:15,443
- ...were both gang members?
- Yes.

587
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:18,244
The older man your officers shot
outside the bar...

588
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,814
...you said he was intoxicated
and confrontational?

589
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:23,850
He reached into his pocket
for what they thought was a gun.

590
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,086
The safety of my men is
my first priority.

591
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,291
I thought it was
to serve and protect.

592
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:31,625
- My men are soldiers.
- Soldiers kill people, captain.

593
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,085
Cops help people.

594
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,029
Until Officers Sancho and Adel
were hired by me...

595
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:38,864
...the only light they saw was
the flash from a gun.

596
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,722
If you politicize this event
and ruin their lives--

597
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,737
The only lives we're
concerned with...

598
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:47,007
...are the families of the men
who lost their lives that night.

599
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:50,110
That's why you'll never understand
what it means to be a cop.

600
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,743
They said Bay Street.
Why we at the beach?

601
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:55,782
Fucking dirty-ass hippies
freak me out, man.

602
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,650
Looking for somebody
stupid enough...

603
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,520
...to walk up to a door with a bag
and say, "Nantucket".

604
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,320
Thought that was gonna be me.

605
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,785
Ifthis is a fucking set-up,
we're not getting shot in the head.

606
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:08,626
We're gonna go in
and make this jack move happen.

607
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,018
Who's a ruthless-ass motherfucker?
I like it.

608
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,407
Okay, you ready?

609
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:26,402
Okay.

610
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:29,492
Now, see? Yeah.

611
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,015
That could be good.

612
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,962
Good. Yeah, I'm good.

613
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:38,724
- You look good. Might take me out.
- See?

614
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:41,187
Dude, dude, what are you loo--?

615
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:43,596
Man, what are you looking at, dude?

616
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:45,408
Honest. Come on, man.

617
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:47,620
Look. Look, it's right here.

618
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:51,918
- See something you like, it's right here.
- Fuck you. You can't just pimp me out.

619
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,090
Well, get it cracking, man.

620
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,263
What? You don't like what you see
or something?

621
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,213
I won't kiss you
in front of your boyfriend.

622
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,582
- He's not my boyfriend, okay?
- Excuse me.

623
00:44:02,582 --> 00:44:05,275
Shit, I can kiss
whoever the fuck I want.

624
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:09,315
And maybe I wanna kiss you.

625
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,222
Oh, is that right?

626
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,052
- Hey, police.
- Shit.

627
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,734
Shit.

628
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:21,644
Hey, don't run. Don't run.

629
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,170
Don't run, you motherfuckers.

630
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,745
I said, stop, you bitch.

631
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:29,899
- Come here. Come here.
- Don't make it hard on yourself.

632
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,407
Put me down.

633
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:34,001
What, you forgot the rules now?

634
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,282
You're not supposed
to fuck with the Man.

635
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:37,573
Shut it.

636
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,615
What happens when you run?

637
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,088
- What's the rule? You get a beat down.
- That's right.

638
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:44,924
You trying to get a beat down?

639
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:47,984
Why you running, anyway?
What, you got something to hide?

640
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,763
We run because you two
motherfuckers is too violent.

641
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:53,666
We run because you shoot me,
then put a gun in my hand.

642
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,196
Shut up. Did I ask you?

643
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:57,337
Hey, leave him the fuck alone, man.

644
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:58,971
I just caught something now.

645
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:01,023
What we got here, lovebirds?

646
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,430
- Nice friends you got there.
- Yeah, well...

647
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,213
...at least we ain't
a bunch of pigs, right?

648
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:15,588
Who the fuck you spitting at,
motherfucker?

649
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,388
Who the fuck you spitting at?

650
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,457
- Salim.
- Crazy little bitch.

651
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:20,852
Stay the fuck still.

652
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:23,495
Salim, let her go. Come on, let's go.

653
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:24,987
Fucking spit on me.

654
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,411
Hey,
I'm guessing white cotton panties.

655
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,739
I bet you I can get you wet
in front of your boyfriend.

656
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,383
I bet you she's a cue ball.

657
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,678
- Nice and tasty too.
- Come on, Salim, let's get out of here.

658
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:41,253
Nigga, hold up. Hold up.

659
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,988
I just wanna make sure she ain't
hiding nothing underneath here.

660
00:45:45,283 --> 00:45:47,938
- Don't worry, Rita, he can't touch you.
- Rita?

661
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:51,059
Is that your name, huh?
Is that your name?

662
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:55,901
All right. Well, Rita, just think of this
as a visit to the gynecologist.

663
00:46:00,432 --> 00:46:01,744
What did I say?

664
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,390
Score one for the niggas in blue, huh?
White cotton undies.

665
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:09,761
Yeah, man. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

666
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,290
I forgot. Are you cue-balled or not?

667
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,016
- Let's see up here.
- No. No, please.

668
00:46:15,713 --> 00:46:18,586
Yep. Her stinky's bare.

669
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,496
You done?

670
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:30,328
We done.

671
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:34,511
Go on, get your shit
and get the fuck out of here, girl.

672
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:41,113
Bye, baby.

673
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:44,829
Hey.

674
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:51,949
I'm going to kill you.

675
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:57,292
Because I am a cop killer.

676
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:00,805
English, motherfucker.

677
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:12,603
Let's cut to the chase, captain.

678
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:16,012
Do you know if any of your officers,
Sancho and Adel included...

679
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:18,343
...were involved in criminal activity?

680
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,693
No. Absolutely not.

681
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:32,497
Okay.

682
00:47:34,492 --> 00:47:37,057
Violence is a language that
people understand.

683
00:47:37,595 --> 00:47:39,800
And sometimes,
when it's necessary....

684
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,223
"When it's necessary".

685
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:44,366
Oh, it sounds beautiful.

686
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:46,904
These convictions you hold...

687
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:49,739
...are far more dangerous
to the truth than to lies.

688
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:52,657
You're knee-deep in a pile of shit.

689
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:55,382
We're all knee-deep in a pile of shit.

690
00:47:57,348 --> 00:48:00,183
And it doesn't matter how high up
you think you are.

691
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,636
It doesn't matter
if you can smell it yet.

692
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,575
It's the same pile of shit
we're all sinking in.

693
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,643
Don't let morality make you stupid.

694
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:13,147
Splooge?

695
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,077
What kind of name is that
for a nigga?

696
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:20,237
That's the sound my dick makes
when it's slipping into your girlfriend.

697
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:23,440
You know, maybe you should
lay off the shit a little, officer.

698
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,678
Maybe you could get it up
and not have to threaten little girls.

699
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:29,738
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me, coke dick.

700
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:32,088
You believe this guy?

701
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:34,793
Man, this is a violation
of informants' rights.

702
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:37,655
Plus, you guys didn't even pay me
last time.

703
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:41,528
This nigga rat on his own peeps
and he wants us to be fair.

704
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:43,190
My peeps?

705
00:48:43,594 --> 00:48:46,557
Baby gangsters ain't got
no morals nowadays, cuz.

706
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:50,071
Oh, okay, so just because I'm black,
I'm a gangster?

707
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,837
You stupid,
ignorant, racist motherfucker.

708
00:48:52,837 --> 00:48:54,952
I ain't no gangster. You a gangster.

709
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:56,313
Shut him up.

710
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:59,453
You feel better about yourself
with that badge on?

711
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:01,278
It's a fucking piece of plastic, yo.

712
00:49:01,278 --> 00:49:04,968
<i>- Little name-calling should do the trick.</i>
- Man, shut him the fuck up.

713
00:49:05,616 --> 00:49:07,198
A rat is what you are.

714
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:10,417
Lowest piece of shit
on the face of the earth.

715
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:12,479
<i>Won't fly in court. You know that.</i>

716
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:15,159
You heard me?
Why'd you get this motherfucker?

717
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:17,194
You couldn't have picked
another nigga?

718
00:49:17,194 --> 00:49:19,130
You picked
this stupid motherfucker.

719
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,470
A parasite is what you are,
motherfucker.

720
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:23,600
Rat on your own fucking people.

721
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,345
This motherfucker ratted on
all you motherfuckers.

722
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,063
This little punk-ass nigga here.
Splooge.

723
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,240
I ain't calling you Splooge no more.
I'm gonna call you "dick juice".

724
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,880
Fucking pay me.

725
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,162
Hey, shut him the fuck up.

726
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:42,596
See, you done fucked up, right?
You know that, right?

727
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:45,929
Just to let you know,
Rita's gonna kill you.

728
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:47,868
Rita.

729
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:50,059
- Oh, yeah, Rita.
- Fuck you.

730
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:52,363
You don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:53,803
Oh, shit, what the--?

732
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,841
Now what?

733
00:50:11,482 --> 00:50:14,915
We watch, wait and look for anything
that doesn't look normal.

734
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,542
Hey, cuz, I think I see something.

735
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:27,783
Motherfucking duct tape
good for everything, yo.

736
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,581
Anybody here strapped?

737
00:50:58,061 --> 00:50:59,262
I need a piece.

738
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:17,372
You're up, nigga.

739
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:19,425
Come on. Come on.

740
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:21,839
Fuck that lumpy-head-ass nigga.

741
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:25,615
Big egghead-looking, crackhead,
Michael Jackson-looking fucker.

742
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:28,644
- That's one ugly nigga right there.
- Oh, shit.

743
00:51:28,658 --> 00:51:30,994
As soon as you inside,
you see the money...

744
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:32,996
...and they know
you won't jack them...

745
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:36,299
...that's when we come in like
Scud missiles, dropping them down.

746
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:38,639
And all you gotta do
is drop the drugs...

747
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,333
...jump down
and crawl your black ass outside.

748
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:42,809
And what do I get?

749
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,210
- They jacking that nigga up.
- They roughing that nigga.

750
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,920
You don't get beat no more.

751
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:51,630
That hurt? Sorry.

752
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,825
At least give me a gun.
I gotta pack some heat.

753
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:56,786
Give me that thing.
Give me a ray gun.

754
00:51:56,786 --> 00:51:58,127
Keep it moving.

755
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:00,273
This is for police.

756
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,815
- Oh, shit.
- Deep-fry that nigga.

757
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:05,974
Yo, I wish we had a camera.
This when you need a camera.

758
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:08,191
You didn't hear him?

759
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:11,437
Gimpy, didn't you hear the man?
Keep on moving.

760
00:52:12,068 --> 00:52:13,903
Look at the white boy pull up.

761
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:16,005
They not gonna fuck
with that white boy.

762
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:18,041
- I'll bet you $100.
- You out your mind.

763
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:21,011
- They about to beat his ass down.
- Put your money up.

764
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:23,970
Give me that.

765
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:27,516
You turn your back
and you think it's all right?

766
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:28,956
You guys real police?

767
00:52:29,752 --> 00:52:31,334
Are we real police?

768
00:52:31,754 --> 00:52:34,049
What's it say on the back
of his jacket?

769
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:38,037
"Are we real police?"
What's that supposed to mean?

770
00:52:38,627 --> 00:52:40,202
Is this a real stun gun?

771
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:43,632
- I told you. I told you, nigga.
- Oh, shit.

772
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:46,917
They stunned that nigga.
Deep-fried that motherfucker's brain.

773
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:49,275
Told you. Give me
my motherfucking money.

774
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,711
There you go.

775
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:54,810
Grab your shit.

776
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,380
You look nice and dumb.

777
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,530
They'll give you whatever you need.
Go ahead, motherfucker.

778
00:53:00,616 --> 00:53:01,987
Hurry up.

779
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,463
He looks like he's 12 years old.
Little bitch-ass nigga.

780
00:53:14,463 --> 00:53:16,532
Look like he going to the crib too.

781
00:53:16,532 --> 00:53:18,377
Yeah, he is going in the crib.

782
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:35,312
What the fuck you want?

783
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:37,860
Nantucket.

784
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:44,099
What, Daddy picked you up
from kindergarten?

785
00:53:44,327 --> 00:53:47,129
He gave me some candy,
threw me in the back of a van...

786
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:48,997
...and told me to touch his wee-wee.

787
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:51,840
God, a young nigga can't be
an entrepreneur? Shit.

788
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:05,904
This shit is taking all fucking day,
man.

789
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:09,674
Doing what we need to be
doing, nigga. Don't sweat it.

790
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,222
So, now, what's in the bag?

791
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:24,179
Weigh this shit.

792
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,380
You weigh it.

793
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:29,975
Hey. Dickhead, you weigh it.

794
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:33,008
- You weigh it, eh.
- No, you weigh it, dickhead.

795
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:35,310
- No, you weigh it, eh.
- Shut up and weigh it.

796
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,922
You got crabs, eh.

797
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:41,694
I got runner-ups, okay?
Someone do the shit, I'm gonna play.

798
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:45,240
I got runner-up on your mom, eh.
Right there, eh.

799
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:48,784
- Oh, yeah? I got--
- Hey. Fucking shut the fuck up.

800
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:52,493
I said, weigh the shit.
I'm not fucking babysitting.

801
00:54:56,598 --> 00:54:58,270
Sorry.

802
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,040
I didn't tell you to fucking
close the bag.

803
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,975
Open the fucking bag, all right?

804
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,660
I gotta test the mess.

805
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:11,466
- That okay with you, Mr. Entrepreneur?
- Whatever.

806
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:18,752
Freeze, motherfucker! Police!

807
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:23,288
Put them where I can see them.
Get on the motherfucking ground.

808
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:25,517
Drop it!

809
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:28,424
- Stay down, bitch.
- Turn the fuck around.

810
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:31,382
Don't fucking move.

811
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:35,050
Shut the fuck up.

812
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,331
Son of a bitch.

813
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,486
What are you doing here?

814
00:55:46,014 --> 00:55:48,266
Armando, you look like shit, eh.

815
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:52,250
They fucked you good.

816
00:55:53,155 --> 00:55:55,135
Sent you to kill your own family.

817
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:58,204
But you are family until you die.

818
00:55:58,659 --> 00:55:59,694
Now you see.

819
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,662
Hey, man, English, motherfucker.

820
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,531
Hey, you ain't no real fucking cop.

821
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:05,700
- Fucking <i>puto</i> motherfucker.
- You know what?

822
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,868
I'm tired of fuckers
calling us fake cops.

823
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,538
- What's up, then, bitch?
- No, back the fuck up.

824
00:56:10,538 --> 00:56:12,940
- I'll pop you in your face.
- Back the fuck up.

825
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,650
All right, then. All right.

826
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,321
I'm unarmed.

827
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:18,035
No gun. <i>Nada</i>, eh.

828
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:21,649
So let's make a deal, all right?

829
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:24,118
Oh, now this motherfucker
wanna make a deal.

830
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:27,358
- I don't mind paying a little tax to--
- Put your head down.

831
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:31,799
But you know you're crazy
if you take this money.

832
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:35,737
Well, you're going to have
to answer to Roland.

833
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,535
The state of California thanks y'all
for your patronage.

834
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:43,271
Come visit the Golden State anytime,
you heard me?

835
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:45,746
- Salim.
- Motherfuckers paid in this bitch.

836
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:46,944
Salim.

837
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,155
Where the fuck did Splooge go?

838
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:02,657
Oh, shit.

839
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,666
I'm shot.

840
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:09,129
What the fuck? Niggas is shooting
in there. We gotta go.

841
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,704
Get up. Get up. Come on.

842
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:19,552
You with me?
Get up, they're coming.

843
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,431
Come on.

844
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:26,911
Salim!

845
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:16,513
Keep your fucking head down.
Keep it down.

846
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:19,699
What's with the blood over here, man?
What's going on?

847
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:21,679
What you got to say for yourself?

848
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:23,797
Where's the shit at?

849
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:28,022
The black dude took the dope,
and the Mexican dude took the money.

850
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:31,483
Get the fuck up.
What the fuck you doing?

851
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:33,781
This ain't no fucking game. Get up.

852
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:54,101
The bullet went straight through,
man.

853
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,436
- That's good.
- I just gotta stop the bleeding.

854
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:58,505
Duct tape good for everything,
right?

855
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,540
Oh, man, what the fuck did
I do to you?

856
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,242
What the fuck did I do to you?

857
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:04,844
The fucking money's gone,
the fucking dope's gone.

858
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:06,336
I'm fucking shot, man.

859
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:30,557
Fucked up. I fucked it up big.

860
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,095
- It was all my fault.
- Don't worry about it, <i>carnal</i>.

861
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,904
You're home. I got your back, <i>ése</i>.

862
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:47,120
You know who the fuck that was
back there?

863
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,595
That was my family.
My first fucking family.

864
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,425
Finger-fuck those bitch, cuz.

865
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,670
We gotta get to a safe house.
I need a doctor. I'm in fucking pain.

866
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:12,834
- I need a fucking doctor here.
- Duct-tape that shit.

867
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:16,659
- I'll kick the back of your fucking head.
- Where is this piece of shit?

868
01:00:17,517 --> 01:00:21,162
He ain't skateboarding down the
boardwalk with 13 kilos, motherfucker.

869
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,405
Motherfucker, you crazy?

870
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:39,730
What the fuck?

871
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:44,460
Where the fuck you going?

872
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:51,150
Oh, this is some fucked-up shit.

873
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:30,854
Salim!

874
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:27,560
Get out of here.

875
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:30,620
Now, motherfucker.

876
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,991
Stay right there. Stay right there.

877
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:37,663
Little nigga.

878
01:02:45,797 --> 01:02:47,909
What the fuck you looking at?

879
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:23,265
You were supposed to feed them,
make them fat, and kill them.

880
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:25,014
Yeah, it wasn't my fault.

881
01:04:26,898 --> 01:04:27,978
You're right.

882
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:30,173
It wasn't your fault.

883
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:33,993
Love for you still, my brother.

884
01:04:41,846 --> 01:04:44,129
I want them all dead.
Go on!

885
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:55,563
- Stupid fucking niggas.
- All right.

886
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:59,686
Call your fucking boys
and make sure they clean it up.

887
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:02,100
I've sent troops over
to Salim's house.

888
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,470
I'm gonna make a personal visit
to Sancho's and see what I can do.

889
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,305
- All right?
- What did you say to Internal Affairs?

890
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:19,310
Did you honestly think
that I was gonna take the fall?

891
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:23,571
I'm just looking out
for number one, captain.

892
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:27,037
And you are on a short leash.

893
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:30,645
So you better keep me close.

894
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,445
They're always watching.

895
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:00,361
Oh, fuck.

896
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:03,498
Fuck.

897
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:06,021
You were right, man.
Baine set us up.

898
01:06:06,831 --> 01:06:08,766
What are we supposed to do, man?

899
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,049
Oh, fuck.

900
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:16,649
What, you deaf and mute now, nigga?
Say something.

901
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,167
What the fuck we supposed to do,
cuz?

902
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,580
You don't know?

903
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,862
I just asked you what the fuck
we supposed to do.

904
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,479
You tell me, homey.

905
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:34,004
Oh, you crazy now?

906
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,967
What, am I talking to
my motherfucking self?

907
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,607
Why were you so anxious
to do this today?

908
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,806
Why were you so anxious?

909
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:45,137
Why's my name
on that goddamn slip?

910
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:48,123
Nigga, have you lost
your motherfucking mind?

911
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:53,627
Hell of a lot easier to come up
with me out of the way, isn't it?

912
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:04,181
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

913
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:14,221
You're my partner, man.

914
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,184
You're my best friend.

915
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:24,246
That's on everything.

916
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:29,376
That's for life.

917
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,474
You heard me?

918
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,044
You heard me, cuz?

919
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,007
That's for life.

920
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,172
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

921
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,816
My nigga.

922
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,727
Oh, shit.

923
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,683
What else am I supposed to do,
you know what I mean? Shit.

924
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,971
I ain't got nowhere else
to motherfucking go.

925
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,052
My homey.

926
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:17,990
Fuck.

927
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,454
What's really going on, cuz?

928
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,052
I had to do something today.

929
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,526
What did you do?

930
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,918
That's the motherfucking doctor.

931
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,885
- You called it in?
- Yeah.

932
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,465
When you was chasing Splooge.

933
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,496
Shut the fuck up.

934
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,010
Don't say nothing.

935
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,300
Salim!

936
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,054
Easy, motherfucker.
Drop the piece, turn the fuck around.

937
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:29,894
Drop the fucking piece.

938
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,302
No, we're a long way
from fucking brothers.

939
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,002
Turn the fuck around
and drop your fucking piece.

940
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,841
- Drop it.
- We're on the same side, man.

941
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,573
What side is that?

942
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,112
- You looking for me, motherfucker?
- Fuck.

943
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,284
Now you drop your shit, bitch.

944
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:48,337
Take this motherfucker's gun, cuz.

945
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,054
That's right, bitch. You like that?

946
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,637
Get your ass in there, motherfucker.

947
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:57,036
You got that nigga, cuz.

948
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,410
Your partner's on the floor
bleeding like a stuck pig...

949
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,433
...and you think this is funny?

950
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,033
You better start talking, motherfucker.
Who sent y'all to fuck us up?

951
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,755
Man, they knew you were gonna rat.
What the fuck do you think?

952
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,247
They thought I was gonna rat?
Who the fuck is "they"?

953
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,749
Who the fuck is "they"?
Think this is a joke?

954
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:23,304
I ought to put this motherfucker
in your eye and blow your head off.

955
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:27,095
- Say something, motherfucker.
- We can still get out of this, man.

956
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,758
Who set us up, motherfucker?

957
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,053
Lieutenant, man,
who the fuck you think?

958
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,086
Lieutenant sent us here,
lieutenant sent you to Baine.

959
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:38,207
- Damn it.
- Well, what the fuck the drugs for?

960
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:41,710
Payment for your murder.
Only Baine fucked up.

961
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:45,623
He was supposed to take you out,
make it look like a gang hit.

962
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:49,094
- You lying, I'll put one through your--
- I'm not fucking lying.

963
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,148
- How'd he know we'd take the job?
- You heard him.

964
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,483
How'd he know
we were gonna take the job?

965
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:56,795
Because, you stupid fuck...

966
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:01,073
...everybody knows you're a wannabe
who can't stand on his own feet.

967
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:06,695
Word?

968
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,184
Yeah, word.

969
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:16,242
- You swear to God?
- I swear to God.

970
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,551
You raise your hand and swear?

971
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,188
Your other hand, motherfucker.

972
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:27,567
Yeah, bitch. I swear to--

973
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,124
- That's what's up.
- That's my fucking hand.

974
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:36,888
You fuck. God.

975
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:41,840
Let him live.
We can still do some good.

976
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,834
I will fucking kill you.

977
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,008
Don't run.

978
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,301
We done good here.

979
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,761
Hey, hey. Hey.

980
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:44,939
Fuck that shit, cuz.

981
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:47,799
And you know I'm driving.

982
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:02,386
Shit. It's on.

983
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:43,174
You got your watch,
you got your rims.

984
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:46,720
- How does it feel?
- It feels good, motherfucker.

985
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:50,799
What the fuck do you want me to say,
I'm sorry?

986
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:56,234
All right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we go to IA, come clean.

987
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,835
- Fuck it.
- Now you wanna come clean.

988
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:01,885
Who we gonna say killed
Rodriguez and Sayed, huh?

989
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:04,272
- Gangbangers.
- Gangbangers?

990
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:06,107
- Word up.
- They're gonna believe...

991
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:09,707
...a beaner and a nigger that just stole
13 keys and killed two cops?

992
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,915
All they care about is the lieutenant.

993
01:14:12,446 --> 01:14:15,506
About the robberies, the dealings
and the drugs and shit.

994
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,002
We go together.
Tell them everything.

995
01:15:08,936 --> 01:15:10,838
Let me ask you something, cuz.

996
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:15,265
How the fuck could they think
we'd rat?

997
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:44,454
As fucked up as I am, I could teach
you a thing or two about loyalty.

998
01:15:52,345 --> 01:15:54,157
Fucking city.

999
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,575
I never could make sense of it.

1000
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,950
I know what I gotta do.

1001
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,882
I don't expect you to come with.

1002
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:10,871
What you say go, remember?

1003
01:18:19,925 --> 01:18:21,950
It's been a long time, my brother.

1004
01:18:27,032 --> 01:18:29,024
I was loyal, <i>carnal</i>.

1005
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:34,082
Loyal to who, is the question.

1006
01:18:40,445 --> 01:18:43,145
None of that <i>pinche mierda</i>
would have happened...

1007
01:18:43,148 --> 01:18:45,803
...if you'd told me you was
protecting H.A. now.

1008
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:57,426
I'm a businessman.

1009
01:18:57,897 --> 01:19:01,821
And when it comes to green,
I'm fucking color-blind.

1010
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:07,242
And I don't need your
fucking permission or approval...

1011
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:11,661
...on how I conduct
my business, officer.

1012
01:19:14,246 --> 01:19:15,507
Sorry.

1013
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,341
Where is my money?

1014
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:27,672
I don't know.

1015
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:32,651
I swear on my Evita's life,
I don't fucking know.

1016
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:37,259
We'll see.

1017
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,692
Your shoeshine boy,
he knows where the money is?

1018
01:19:44,944 --> 01:19:47,959
Have you ever seen what
someone looks like with no skin?

1019
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:54,202
You see what a man is.

1020
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:56,691
I mean, really is. Flesh and blood.

1021
01:19:57,622 --> 01:20:00,665
It's very interesting.
I enjoy it quite a lot.

1022
01:20:01,326 --> 01:20:03,441
And I never skinned a nigger before.

1023
01:20:40,532 --> 01:20:42,554
You have one choice.

1024
01:20:43,568 --> 01:20:47,033
You tell me where the money is,
or you have a bullet in your head.

1025
01:20:52,977 --> 01:20:55,227
One pull of the trigger for yourself...

1026
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:57,959
...or, as I assume you will
choose to do...

1027
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,070
...two pulls of the trigger
for your partner.

1028
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:08,400
I am curious to know
where your true loyalty lies.

1029
01:21:09,193 --> 01:21:11,263
Cuz, tell this nigga what happened.

1030
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:15,498
Tell him we got jacked and don't know
where the money is. Tell him, cuz.

1031
01:21:19,037 --> 01:21:20,679
Who wants to go first?

1032
01:21:25,477 --> 01:21:27,178
Fine, I choose.

1033
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:49,021
It doesn't have to be this way.

1034
01:21:51,536 --> 01:21:53,471
Just tell me where the money is.

1035
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:59,781
One to yourself, or two to him.

1036
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:05,884
Shoot that bitch.
Shoot that white bitch.

1037
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:10,172
- Shoot him.
- Pull the fucking trigger, <i>ése.</i>

1038
01:22:10,421 --> 01:22:12,093
Do it, <i>ése</i>.

1039
01:22:15,426 --> 01:22:16,297
Salim!

1040
01:22:16,627 --> 01:22:18,697
You want a bullet in your head too?

1041
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,395
You don't hear me, motherfucker?
I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

1042
01:22:22,466 --> 01:22:24,108
Salim!

1043
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:26,317
I'm just bullshitting.

1044
01:22:26,838 --> 01:22:28,129
Salim!

1045
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:37,719
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

1046
01:22:38,249 --> 01:22:41,092
Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1047
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,573
<i>Redemption is remembrance.</i>

1048
01:22:53,231 --> 01:22:55,483
<i>I killed an innocent man.</i>

1049
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:12,367
That's some gangster shit right there,
homey.

1050
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,553
It shows integrity, yeah. Bravery.

1051
01:23:16,154 --> 01:23:18,406
<i>Pero</i> redemption does not come
so easy.

1052
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:29,463
Do it, pig.

1053
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:35,163
Do it.

1054
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:38,159
- Grab it, <i>puto</i>.
- Grab it.

1055
01:23:56,627 --> 01:23:59,209
Fuck. Fuck.

1056
01:24:27,591 --> 01:24:28,702
All right.

1057
01:24:29,059 --> 01:24:31,432
I know-- I know where the money is.

1058
01:24:33,497 --> 01:24:35,489
I know where the money is.

1059
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:39,282
Stashed it in a motherfucking alley.

1060
01:24:54,117 --> 01:24:56,637
That the kind of family
you were looking for?

1061
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:01,511
That the kind of family
who would die for you?

1062
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,912
Hey, let us go, man, now.

1063
01:25:09,532 --> 01:25:11,705
I'll take you to the dough.

1064
01:25:22,145 --> 01:25:26,159
One pull of the trigger for yourself,
or two for him.

1065
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:28,570
That's not the deal, cuz.

1066
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:32,575
- You got one more shot, <i>puto</i>.
- Shut the fuck up. The game is over.

1067
01:25:33,323 --> 01:25:36,293
You kill me, you don't get the dough.
That's what's up.

1068
01:25:49,072 --> 01:25:50,944
Look at him.

1069
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:56,172
Look at him!

1070
01:26:03,653 --> 01:26:05,048
Hey, motherfucker...

1071
01:26:06,622 --> 01:26:08,734
...I want you to look at him.

1072
01:26:13,029 --> 01:26:14,140
Look at him.

1073
01:26:14,564 --> 01:26:16,846
You take a good fucking look at him.

1074
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,032
It's never over.

1075
01:26:39,389 --> 01:26:41,414
<i>There's only one kind of wisdom...</i>

1076
01:26:41,924 --> 01:26:43,736
<i>...and that's hindsight.</i>

1077
01:26:44,194 --> 01:26:45,994
<i>Everything happens in bits...</i>

1078
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:49,352
<i>...and you don't wake up</i>
<i>until afterwards.</i>

1079
01:26:50,433 --> 01:26:52,485
<i>Until it's too late.</i>

1080
01:26:58,608 --> 01:27:00,420
What's it smell like?

1081
01:27:17,593 --> 01:27:19,465
Take him to get the money.

1082
01:27:20,062 --> 01:27:21,464
<i>In that final moment...</i>

1083
01:27:21,464 --> 01:27:24,507
<i>...you wait for something,</i>
<i>anything, to take you away.</i>

1084
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:28,240
<i>And what returns,</i>
<i>what finally comes home to you...</i>

1085
01:27:28,904 --> 01:27:31,597
<i>...is your own fucking self.</i>

1086
01:27:32,174 --> 01:27:34,427
<i>Nothing can save you from that.</i>

1087
01:27:36,979 --> 01:27:38,581
Police officer. I need help.

1088
01:27:38,581 --> 01:27:40,042
Help.

1089
01:27:40,483 --> 01:27:42,354
I need help!

1090
01:27:57,567 --> 01:28:00,179
<i>You can't change</i>
<i>the color of your skin.</i>

1091
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,110
<i>You can't change</i>
<i>the color of your heart.</i>

1092
01:28:03,438 --> 01:28:06,311
<i>You can change</i>
<i>the colors you wear...</i>

1093
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:09,842
<i>...but deep down inside,</i>
<i>you'll always be...</i>

1094
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:14,760
<i>...the same salvationless</i>
<i>motherfucker you always were.</i>

1095
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,853
No idea. No.

1096
01:28:22,624 --> 01:28:24,424
Hey, where the fuck you been?

1097
01:28:25,627 --> 01:28:27,499
Jesus.

1098
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:32,304
Got the chem-lab report.

1099
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:40,582
Fake shit. Cut with
some heavy-duty rat poison.

1100
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:43,893
Fucking payback.

1101
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:07,566
Bye, bitch.

1102
01:29:27,722 --> 01:29:30,602
It's never easy grieving
over the death of a partner.

1103
01:29:30,758 --> 01:29:33,233
Even if he went crazy
and tried to kill you.

1104
01:29:34,562 --> 01:29:38,226
The pressure of knowing he did wrong
that day must have gotten to him.

1105
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:42,017
You had no choice,
it was self-defense.

1106
01:29:42,804 --> 01:29:46,148
After he killed Rodriguez and Sayed
single-handedly.

1107
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:50,037
We're even more sorry
about your girlfriend.

1108
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:53,124
I'm sorry he made it personal.

1109
01:29:53,781 --> 01:29:56,153
Our deepest sympathies.

1110
01:30:07,962 --> 01:30:10,685
But my son Elijah's okay, right?

1111
01:30:19,674 --> 01:30:23,838
So according to your report,
after roll call...

1112
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:27,161
...you went on your rounds.

1113
01:30:31,519 --> 01:30:36,854
Sancho turned on you, went ballistic.
You went in pursuit.

1114
01:30:41,328 --> 01:30:44,522
You told Officer Sancho
that you were gonna come clean...

1115
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,453
...and let IA know that he was
responsible for the shooting.

1116
01:30:49,136 --> 01:30:50,531
You understand that?

1117
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:53,581
Good.

1118
01:30:54,008 --> 01:30:56,501
You showed yourself to be
a real hero today.

1119
01:30:57,044 --> 01:30:58,916
You should be proud.

1120
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:06,323
Oh, I called Internal Affairs.

1121
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:09,181
Let them know you'd be a little late.

1122
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,882
I'm sorry it got so messy, Salim.

1123
01:31:16,698 --> 01:31:19,398
Listen, you're gonna be at IA
for a little while.

1124
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:21,806
You still have
those courtside seats?

1125
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:29,286
<i>Nobody talks about the day</i>
<i>of their death like, "Today is the day".</i>

1126
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:34,892
<i>But today was the day.</i>

1127
01:32:42,816 --> 01:32:45,606
You see things a lot more clearly
when you're dead.
