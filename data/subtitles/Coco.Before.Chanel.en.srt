1
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,159
COCO BEFORE CHANEL

2
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,031
Obazine Orphanage 1893

3
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,598
Girls who have visitors...

4
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,637
...follow me.

5
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,358
Come on.

6
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,748
Come on, let's go.

7
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,069
I don't want to.

8
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,914
I waited for my father every Sunday.

9
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,716
He never came back.

10
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,236
Moulins - 15 years later

11
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,319
Lost my little cute Coco
Doggy that I did adore

12
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,950
Trotted off at Trocadero
Now my doggy is no more

13
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,749
One regret, undermining
As I do the cruel recap

14
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,358
While my man was out two-timing
Coco was sleeping in my lap

15
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,195
Has anyone seen Coco?
Coco in Trocadero?

16
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,150
Has any of you seen Coco?

17
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,991
-For Coco.
-Have a seat.

18
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,839
Hookers, that way.

19
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,356
For Coco.

20
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,470
Is that all I'm worth?

21
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,073
Nice of you.

22
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,958
Your baron is here.

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,752
Coming?

24
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,477
Come on, please. He's not alone.

25
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,952
Darling, this is Etienne Balsan.

26
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,269
That was wonderful.

27
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,475
My pleasure.

28
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,073
Gabrielle, Adrienne's sister.

29
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,071
Fanny, Queen of the Night.

30
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,189
Not to pry, but who's younger?

31
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,193
-Gabrielle.
-I couldn't guess your age.

32
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,432
-How old? 16? 25?
-When I'm bored, I feel ancient.

33
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,718
Very clever.

34
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,233
How old do you feel now?

35
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,314
A thousand years old.

36
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,399
Pleasant girl.

37
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,312
Is she always so blunt?

38
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,072
Aren't you?

39
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,594
Running off?

40
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,353
We're drying up. Let's drink.

41
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,953
-Champagne.
-Good idea.

42
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,551
I'll pour it, thanks.

43
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,913
-Some champagne for Coco.
-Gabrielle.

44
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,990
It's too prim. I prefer Coco.

45
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,515
-Coco sounds…
-It is nice.

46
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,478
For a rooster. You have lousy taste.

47
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,073
I like it.

48
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,630
Do you ever speak kindly? Huh?

49
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,876
Try saying something nice.

50
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,713
I have nothing to say.

51
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,357
Those dark little eyes.

52
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,230
Caroline
Your shoes are all a-shine

53
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,152
And your flowery hat, so fine

54
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,793
When you stall, you're such a pain

55
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,713
Keep on walking, stop that talking

56
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,953
You'll make us miss our train

57
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,873
Girls.

58
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,759
The petticoat is torn. It's urgent.

59
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,114
The frill on the bottom.

60
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,470
-Come on, it's easy.
-Please.

61
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,438
Done.

62
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,874
Don't tell me the end.

63
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,156
It's always the same thing.

64
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,595
Blanche the orphan
overcomes obstacles...

65
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,593
...and marries the Prince of Espeyrac.

66
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,518
Story of my life.

67
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,909
I hadn't thought of that.

68
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,389
You're mean.

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,357
Have you been to India? No.

70
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,115
Blanche did,
to prove she's no gold digger.

71
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,872
You want me to go to India?

72
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,919
Making out with your baron
in some rat hole won't get you far.

73
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,559
He loves me.

74
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,119
I even met his friend.

75
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,829
He's just showing he can get
a pretty girl into bed.

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,434
Love is best in fairy tales.

77
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,556
You have no heart.

78
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,196
The only thing interesting in love...

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,470
...is making love.

80
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,713
Too bad you need a guy for that.

81
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,517
We're on, Cocorico.

82
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,718
That was stupendous.

83
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,834
Thank you, Mr. Balsan.

84
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,911
-I mean it.
-Even the second time?

85
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,878
I missed some nuances the first time.

86
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,837
Have a seat.

87
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,519
Did I say something wrong?

88
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,796
She wants to leave us alone.

89
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,871
To convert me to the cause of love.

90
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,153
I'd like to help.

91
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,117
So, what must I do?

92
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,350
Do I blush? Play shy?

93
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,557
Do I say "Oh, please do, honey"?

94
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,756
"Yes, my love"?

95
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
I like "Yes, my love." Not bad at all.

96
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,437
A woman in love is helpless.

97
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
Like a begging dog.

98
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,758
Her tongue hanging out.

99
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,712
Slobbering.

100
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,995
Not a pretty sight.

101
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,992
-Are you nervous?
-No.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,593
Yes, you are.

103
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,112
Something to drink?

104
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,032
Champagne.

105
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,750
I was sure he'd be useful.

106
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,831
He knows someone at the Alcazar.

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,719
We can audition whenever we want.

108
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,553
Paris, here we come.

109
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,233
You find him attractive?

110
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,958
Balsan? With that face.

111
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,678
Liar. I bet you're hooked.

112
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,273
He's not as dumb as the others.
And has connections.

113
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,394
We need a new song.

114
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,312
Something more chic.

115
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,789
And some money for new dresses.

116
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,349
Good work. He drank three bottles.

117
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,999
It's not that hard.

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,832
This way we're all happy.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,470
What do you think?
I'll whore around to fill your pockets?

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,232
Very well.

121
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,549
Violette.

122
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,551
-You know the "Coco" song?
-Yes.

123
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,153
You'll sing it now.

124
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,359
Beat it. Don't ever come back.
You neither.

125
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,717
Good going.
How do we get new dresses now?

126
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,076
You're crazy.

127
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,669
The bastard asked for it. Hurry up.

128
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,275
I'm torpedo girl

129
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,158
See how I whirl

130
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,993
Touch me, but beware
You stand no prayer

131
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,354
Not good at all.

132
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,195
On "I'm torpedo girl"
we need something splashy.

133
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,998
Try lunging forward.

134
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,878
Go on, start over.

135
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,878
I'm torpedo girl
See how I whirl

136
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,875
Touch me, but beware
You stand no prayer

137
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,799
What are you doing?

138
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,076
It should be looser in the back.

139
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,839
You'll ruin it.

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,833
You need some room.
To be comfortable.

141
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,149
Now try.

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,193
Will it hold? It's not a striptease.

143
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,999
You'd grab their attention.

144
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,558
Good morning, Coco.

145
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,358
Good morning.

146
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,315
Like seeing me work on all fours?

147
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,999
No.

148
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,631
This is a very nice model.

149
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,074
Can we speak?

150
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,593
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

151
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,833
It was hard to find you.

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,752
No longer working nights?

153
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,239
No.

154
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,631
You have some free time?

155
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,829
Hm?

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,673
I have an idea. Think before refusing.

157
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,875
How about dinner one night?

158
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,109
Recent convert to the cause of love?

159
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,633
Me?

160
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,199
-You're not my type.
-Good.

161
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,429
Mademoiselle...

162
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,272
...you're not paid to chit-chat.

163
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,518
So?

164
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,031
Okay.

165
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,358
Very well.

166
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,559
See you soon. Madame, if I may,
I find you stunning.

167
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,714
Not eating?

168
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,108
I don't like it.

169
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,431
I ate lots of it as a kid.
Now it sickens me.

170
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,558
We were wealthy.
Papa speculated in wine.

171
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,029
I thought you were an orphan.

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,316
For you, all singers are.

173
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,031
I didn't say that. Your sister
told Maurice you were orphans.

174
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,595
I repeat what I hear.

175
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,228
She loves to tug
at people's heartstrings.

176
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,719
No, in fact...

177
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,438
...I was Papa's favorite.

178
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,070
When Mama died, he went to America.

179
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,073
So I have a father. I'm not an orphan.

180
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,233
Being an orphan is no crime.
If it were, I'd be rotting in jail.

181
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,879
I'm an orphan myself.

182
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,429
-Really?
-My parents died two years ago.

183
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,558
-How sad.
-A reason to rejoice.

184
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,392
I feel alive again.

185
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,233
We weren't speaking.
Complicated family.

186
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,231
Did they hit you?

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,514
Goodness, no. Why?

188
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,114
That would have justified my anger.

189
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,918
In fact, I found them...

190
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,957
...lacking in imagination.

191
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,269
Deadly boring.

192
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,795
The aunts who raised me
beat me and starved me.

193
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,789
I always hoped Papa
would come back.

194
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,594
Poor Coco.

195
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,079
No, why?

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,073
Kids like you raised with nannies
and whatnot...

197
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,832
...end up unhappy or retarded.

198
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,870
Retarded, yes. I couldn't agree more.

199
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,271
Look at me. Pathetic.
I should have met you earlier.

200
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,997
Oh, Etienne!

201
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,112
That one...

202
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,113
...I should have met much later.

203
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,513
Too many feathers, too much makeup.

204
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,715
Too much everything.

205
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,313
How do you see yourself?

206
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,311
I mean....

207
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,837
I look like a whore.

208
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,115
My dress for the Alcazar.

209
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,636
The only nice thing about it
was the flower.

210
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,835
Torpedo girl.

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,275
I'm torpedo girl

212
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,919
See how I whirl

213
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,513
Gentlemen, beware

214
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,318
You stand no prayer

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,511
It's fantastic

216
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,999
I'm electric

217
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,718
The prognostic

218
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,953
My dear gent
Your every cent will be well-spent

219
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,238
We start next Tuesday.

220
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,516
We go on at 10, before the star.

221
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,477
Our own dressing room.

222
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,473
Our name on the door.

223
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,510
Undo this. I'm suffocating.

224
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,518
The Alcazar.

225
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,716
Fame and fortune will be ours.

226
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,996
Paris, here we come.

227
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,553
I can't sing with you.

228
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,835
What do you mean?

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,956
Maurice wants to marry me.

230
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,474
We'll be living near Paris.

231
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,356
I'll be a baroness.

232
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,669
So no more singing.

233
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,592
Look at me.

234
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,069
Barons don't marry girls like you.

235
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,037
You're dreaming, Adrienne.

236
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,156
You'll sing what we rehearsed.

237
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,958
No, I won't.

238
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,472
He knows Mama died
and Papa sells pots and pans?

239
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,108
That you were abandoned at 9?

240
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,236
I hope you'll forgive me.

241
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,989
Hear my musical credo
Pay on your way out

242
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,709
I'm an electrical torpedo
I'II make you sing and shout

243
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,156
Touch me, feel the tingle
Whether young or old

244
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,153
When our currents do commingle

245
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,674
One look and you'll be sold

246
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,431
I'm torpedo girl

247
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,238
See how I whirl

248
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,312
Gents, beware
You stand no prayer

249
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,278
It's fantastic

250
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,839
I'm electric

251
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,913
Dear gent
Your every cent will be well-spent

252
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,671
Thank you, miss.

253
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,636
-May l?
-Of course.

254
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,638
Ladies.

255
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,434
Are you okay, Coco?

256
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,478
Forget about the Alcazar.

257
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,230
-I know someone at La Rotonde.
-Enough's enough.

258
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,633
I came to say goodbye.

259
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,552
You're leaving?

260
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,234
-I'm going home.
-You don't live here?

261
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,630
Thank God, no.

262
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,030
I owed a few weeks to the army.

263
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,634
I'm Parisian born and bred.

264
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,836
You live in Paris?

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,833
I live outside Paris, in Compiègne.

266
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,279
Very well.

267
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,111
Time for friends to part ways.

268
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,036
I'm glad we met.

269
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,438
Good luck, Coco.

270
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,914
-Mr. Balsan, please.
-And you are...?

271
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,036
Gabrielle. Coco.

272
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,315
Good boy.

273
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,839
Coco?

274
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,833
What are you doing here?

275
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,592
My sister lives nearby.

276
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,716
Surprise visit, but she's out.

277
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,997
I remembered you lived around here.

278
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,559
Better than the train station.

279
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,717
Huh. And I was worried
you missed me.

280
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,997
Joseph, if you would
put Coco in the floral bedroom.

281
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,037
You're here now.

282
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,758
I can't lock you out.

283
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,516
After you.

284
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,749
You like books?

285
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,639
Rest assured, I haven't read any.

286
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,234
I want to show you something.

287
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,832
Coco, I want you to meet...

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,831
...my family.

289
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,230
Family, this is Coco.

290
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,879
Bow down.

291
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,829
My grandfather.

292
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,918
Founder of the Balsan dynasty.
Great man.

293
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,548
The other Gabrielle I knew,
before you.

294
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,119
Gabrielle Balsan.

295
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,510
No husband, no children, thank God.

296
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,511
You look alike.

297
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,351
How awful. You're right.

298
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,839
Remind me to take it down.

299
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,958
His name was Patellière.
A crook, a cousin.

300
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,758
Thank God he died poor.

301
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,313
And this...

302
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,549
...is my bedroom.

303
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,754
Don't be shy.

304
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,353
The final hurdle.

305
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,713
Minouche won.

306
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,997
The race was incredible.
I was very lucky.

307
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,471
Washington, not the president...

308
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,756
...had two false starts. Disqualified.

309
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,879
That's not all. Night Flight,
the favorite, ran off track.

310
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,998
That left Minouche.
She ran to the finish line.

311
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,639
Whizzed right by.

312
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,552
Like a rocket.

313
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,073
Am I speaking Chinese?

314
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,994
Here, you have to care about horses.
Why aren't you ready?

315
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,479
I'd like to stay on.

316
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,073
What about your sister?

317
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,753
I forgot her address.

318
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,478
It's a bit complicated.

319
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,312
I have guests.

320
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,959
Some other time.

321
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,348
I'll be discreet.

322
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,149
Not my thing,
Bluebeard locking women upstairs.

323
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,276
You won't know I'm here.

324
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,952
Fine.

325
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,678
Two days. No more.

326
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,675
You should try with a saddle.

327
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,717
I couldn't find one.

328
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,118
Can I learn in two days?

329
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,918
No way.

330
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,395
This thing is impossible.

331
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,357
-Someone may see you.
-So what?

332
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,919
I can't let you.

333
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,308
What do I do, kick?

334
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,758
Come back. Pull the reins.

335
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,512
My friends. Dinner is served.

336
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,796
See that blonde? Jockeys have it
made. Pays to be small and ugly.

337
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,798
Monsieur's latest catch is a shrimp.

338
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,519
The plates.

339
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,796
Joseph, serve the champagne.

340
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,188
Yes, sir.

341
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,197
Slice some truffles.

342
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,032
This napkin is dirty.

343
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,596
It's yours. Your ring.

344
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,910
My ring? Dirty napkins in a ring?

345
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,195
Yes, miss.

346
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,196
It's Bluebeard.

347
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,113
Here to claim his due.

348
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,119
Beware. Nothing I say
can be used against me. Hm?

349
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,791
You were magnificent.

350
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,633
An angel of absence, seen by no one.

351
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,233
Heard by no one.

352
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,549
Leave me alone.

353
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,156
Where did my little mouse hide?
Up in my attic.

354
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,592
Get off.

355
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,390
It was so boring. You can't imagine.

356
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,595
I'm hot.

357
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,671
My great-grandfather's cufflinks.

358
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,876
They give me the creeps. Help me.

359
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,393
No.

360
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,912
What do you mean?

361
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,754
Hold on.

362
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,797
Have you heard of Japan?

363
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,279
-Japan.
-Obviously.

364
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,079
They have geishas.
Ever heard of them?

365
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,472
They tend wholly to their men.
They wash and dress them.

366
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,631
They remove their cufflinks.

367
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,074
Like slaves.

368
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,676
In a way. Come on, get to work.

369
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,070
Help take off my cufflinks.

370
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,832
Or else...

371
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,349
...back to the station.

372
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,511
Come on, give me a hand.

373
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,757
My little geisha.

374
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,350
Who'd abandon this poor creature?
For so long?

375
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,511
Who's my little doll?

376
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,197
I'm big, I'm bad, I'm Bluebeard.

377
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,757
We'll meet here afterwards.

378
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,148
We're not together?

379
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,914
No, we're not. I'm stuck in the boxes.

380
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,789
Do you mind?
But the lawn is fine, even better.

381
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,714
You don't have to listen
to the boring gentry-folk.

382
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,552
I mean it.

383
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,709
Dynamite and Magic Dream,
in the third.

384
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,599
They're my horses.

385
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,073
I thought you disappeared.

386
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,629
Get my letters?
Why didn't you answer?

387
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,317
I was sulking.

388
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,515
Why are you here?

389
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,954
I'm with Balsan.

390
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,269
You live with him?

391
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,670
Of course I do. I live in a castle.

392
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,833
My own bathtub, big bed,
servants fawning over me.

393
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,314
I do nothing all day.

394
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,869
This is wonderful. We're neighbors.

395
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,196
How is it going with your baron?

396
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,998
Very well. We're so in love.

397
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,673
We live in the shadows.

398
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,752
-He hides you?
-No, we're getting married soon.

399
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,388
Like my dress? A gift from Maurice.

400
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,074
You must rake up mud with that train.

401
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,993
This style is all the rage in Paris.

402
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,555
It'll fit in perfectly up in the boxes.

403
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,555
Pfft! Look at them.
Bored out of their wits.

404
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,796
Soon they'll kill to dine with us.

405
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,354
I'm glad you're up.
We can say goodbye.

406
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,513
-Remember the chocolate.
-In the basket.

407
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,831
I'm off. You'll be taken to the station.

408
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,636
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hm.

409
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,556
Drop me a line sometime. Hm?

410
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,551
Any raspberry jam left?

411
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,312
Give some to her.

412
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,118
Homegrown. Delicious.

413
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,877
Come on, my friends, let's get going.

414
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,552
Your carriage is waiting.

415
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,188
I won't be going.

416
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,799
Whoa! Oh, oh, oh!

417
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,355
I'm sorry.

418
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,829
I wanted one last ride. He panicked.

419
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,069
You, on a horse?

420
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,071
I've always ridden.
Riding saved me from suicide.

421
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,830
When my aunts used to hit me...

422
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,592
...I'd go out riding.

423
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,113
You call that riding?

424
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,554
I'm here, aren't l?

425
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,438
You kept your boy hidden.

426
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,512
To no avail.

427
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,474
Ladies and gentlemen, Coco.

428
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,471
Full of surprises. Some of them good.

429
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,591
Gorgeous costume.

430
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,600
You couldn't afford a riding skirt?

431
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,234
I'd be surprised that she lasts,
whatever her name is.

432
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,550
She's charming,
but lacking in frivolity.

433
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,238
I've eaten too much.

434
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,113
As pretty as ever.

435
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,838
That's kind of you.

436
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,228
Where's your jockey?

437
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,356
Racing. Good riddance.

438
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,317
-Already over?
-We'll see.

439
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,277
He mounts me like a chimp.

440
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,919
Even in my dressing room.

441
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,115
I mean it.

442
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,713
And like all short men...

443
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,269
...he's well-endowed. It's exhausting.

444
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,078
You men are exhausting.

445
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,674
Exhausting perhaps, but indispensable.

446
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,349
That's true.

447
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,238
But I may prefer women.

448
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,190
-Liar.
-You made me laugh.

449
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,839
Young man, what do you think?

450
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,353
What do you prefer?

451
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,794
Don't be afraid.

452
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,029
Go ahead.

453
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,349
Say something.

454
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,912
Speak up. Say what you think.

455
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,033
Skin is skin.

456
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,079
Well said.

457
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,352
How did you decide this?

458
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,354
I shut off the light.

459
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,438
Clever.

460
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,192
Charming.

461
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,708
Oh! On this note,
allow me to propose a little brandy...

462
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,313
...and another round.

463
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,238
These amazone saddles
are impractical. She's right.

464
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,071
You're very smart, mademoiselle.

465
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,391
We get put on top,
like cherries on a cake.

466
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,033
He didn't give you the nicest room.

467
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,233
Even Maud had the blue room.

468
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,515
You're not his type.

469
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,355
Wear a corset. Be more feminine.

470
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,075
-This is cute.
-Try it on.

471
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,351
Give me a hand.

472
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,877
You're prettier without it.

473
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,879
I feel totally naked.

474
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,630
You have a forehead,
a nose, a mouth.

475
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,835
Where are you?

476
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,719
He can't be left alone for a second.

477
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,950
They'll think I can't afford feathers.

478
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,394
Not at all.

479
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,028
With this on, how can you think?

480
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,028
Think.

481
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,519
Or is it just an act?

482
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,393
Oh! Where did he find you?

483
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,949
Keep it.

484
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,476
What else prevents me from thinking?
Go on, tell me.

485
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,915
Don't worry, I don't bite.

486
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,908
Get rid of all this.

487
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,271
It's fine for a carnival.

488
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,591
Without some adornments
I'd feel poor.

489
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,239
She's a bit primitive.

490
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,154
I forgot to tell you.
I'll be starring in "Joan of Arc."

491
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,753
You, playing a virgin?

492
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,558
Yes.

493
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,517
Leave some slack. Left, right.

494
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,989
Get it? Now let's try to gallop.

495
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,834
Close your right eye.

496
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,911
-I can't.
-So close the left one.

497
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,594
-Close an eye.
-Strange lesson.

498
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,957
It's very important.
Keep one eye ready...

499
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,793
...in case you get mud in the other.

500
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,278
You know, what I just told you...

501
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,556
...is an old Balsan family secret.

502
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,154
I'll become the best rider around.

503
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,716
Could take months, if not years.

504
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,359
So what?

505
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,839
I should have been wary.
Sent you back while I still could.

506
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,671
What is this outfit?

507
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,671
Where's the dress I gave you?

508
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,832
At my window.
I felt like a walking curtain.

509
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,991
Too bad. You almost looked feminine.

510
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,596
Disappointed?
They'll think I'm a cheap date.

511
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,749
Not bad.

512
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,070
Dear aunt,
allow me to pay my respects.

513
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,229
Excellent, Etienne.

514
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,197
Take this, auntie.

515
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,112
They come less for the actress...

516
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,193
...than for the tart
who ruined this count or that heir.

517
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,316
No one cares about my acting.

518
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,871
It's relaxing, like being
a tourist attraction or a monument.

519
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,072
Ever get stage fright?

520
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,511
Yes, but less and less.

521
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,954
Not a good sign.

522
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,159
Come see the play.
We perform every night.

523
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,629
Can you make me another hat?

524
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,395
-The first was a smash hit.
-Of course.

525
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,710
By the way, bravo.

526
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,632
For the length of your stay.

527
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,110
You're breaking my record.

528
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,189
Soup's on.

529
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,078
Vintage 1882.

530
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,514
Worth swooning over.

531
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,679
I'm lodging a drunk.

532
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,270
So Balsan found you in a saloon?

533
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,759
Not at all.

534
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,797
It was an exclusive cabaret.

535
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,678
She has a marvelous voice.

536
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,956
Really? I'd love to hear you.

537
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,395
Yes. Come on, Coco, sing for us.

538
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,788
Does anyone know "Coco"?

539
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,949
Go on, sing.

540
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,634
Has anyone seen Coco?
Coco in Trocadero?

541
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,950
Come on, sing.

542
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,109
Sing.

543
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,111
We're bored.

544
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,998
Aww!

545
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,434
Make an effort.

546
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,353
Make it look like you're having fun.

547
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,954
You're here to entertain. So sing.

548
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,156
She's accepted your invitation.

549
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,349
Ah!

550
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,953
Do you know "Coco"?

551
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,439
Or else, no more riding.
Just bread and water.

552
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,711
Can I see?

553
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,109
Your book.

554
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,959
Even stupid books
have some truth to them.

555
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,834
Think what the other books
can teach you.

556
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,874
I was looking for you.

557
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,153
I knew I'd find you here.

558
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,393
Books are meant to be read,
aren't they?

559
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,120
And horses to be mounted. Come on.

560
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,715
Coco. Get dressed.

561
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,437
You're elegant.

562
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,153
You all right?

563
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,273
Nothing scares you.

564
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,948
What's your name?

565
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,998
Gabrielle. But everyone calls me Coco.

566
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,469
They call me boy.

567
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
But in England, I'm Arthur Capel.

568
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,677
The problem with nicknames
is that they stick.

569
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,197
You're stuck with it.

570
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,920
My father used to call me Coco.

571
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,517
He'd wake me up shouting,
"cock-a-doodle-do."

572
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,240
It soon became Coco-doodle.

573
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,674
And it stuck.

574
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,958
Has any of you seen Coco?

575
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,317
Her big number at the saloon.
Nice choice, right?

576
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,313
Her Coco, me Rico. Cocorico.

577
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,633
Am I interrupting?

578
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,631
I was admiring her style.

579
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,279
Ah, her style.

580
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
Don't overdo it or I'll lose my tailor.

581
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,151
She likes dresses with no corsets...

582
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,514
...shoes with no heels...

583
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,069
...hats with no feathers.

584
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,514
That's my Coco.

585
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,069
You're right to opt for simplicity.

586
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,389
You think so?

587
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,233
I like things when they overflow.

588
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,277
No meat on these bones.

589
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,839
Stop it.

590
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,434
No.

591
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,318
I disagree.

592
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,629
You're right.

593
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,597
Her look is rather pleasant.

594
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,194
Stick to your horse dung.

595
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,356
-Are you sick?
-No.

596
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,274
So be nice. Get up, get dressed
and come downstairs.

597
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,953
They're all waiting.

598
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,712
Good for them.

599
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,950
What's wrong, Coco? Hm?

600
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,997
I hate entertaining your degenerates.

601
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,752
I'm tired of your mood swings.

602
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,071
The lord of the manor is tired.
What's new?

603
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,079
Don't use that tone.

604
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,231
-I'll speak as I please.
-No!

605
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,469
Just shut up.

606
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,709
You're the boor.

607
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,838
Without your money
you'd lose your friends.

608
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,798
Okay.

609
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,909
Forget it.
Come down when you're calm.

610
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,470
I'll never calm down.
What do you think?

611
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,030
Play with your rich scions,
dumb jockeys and whores.

612
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,237
All I do is perfect my gallop
and screw a drunk.

613
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,631
The gate's open.
You're not forced to stay.

614
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,552
When people see us,
I know they wonder...

615
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,757
...how can this elegant woman
love such a fat man?

616
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,630
I'm not that fat.
I'm losing weight at the moment.

617
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,268
Yes, but you're not very attractive.

618
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,435
I'm kind.

619
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,079
You're more than that.

620
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,879
You're understanding,
talented, charming.

621
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,519
Such is my dilemma.
My lover is more like a husband.

622
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,235
Okay, let me think.

623
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,469
You're not shapely...

624
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,835
...but you're attractive. And amusing.

625
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,514
There's Romain Neuville. Great family.

626
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,716
Cultivated. He'll show you around.

627
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,154
Get you out of the stables.

628
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,309
Who's this?

629
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,595
But he's not much fun.

630
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,116
I know a duke also.
On the old side, but generous.

631
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,670
I want to work.

632
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,114
To make a living.

633
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,232
To be an actress.

634
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,550
You're too old to be an ingènue.

635
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,837
And work, what a strange idea.

636
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,991
You're famous. You know people.

637
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,071
You can find me something.

638
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,152
Something....
What did you do before Balsan?

639
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,719
Nothing. Some sewing.

640
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,838
That's easy enough to do in Paris.

641
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,635
Not a bad idea.

642
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,950
You're talented.

643
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,315
Everyone loves your straw hats.

644
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,792
You can work at a hat shop.

645
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,995
I don't want to.

646
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,633
You want, but you don't know what.

647
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,869
Émilienne, help.

648
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,917
Does Balsan know your plans?

649
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,631
Hurry back to the castle.

650
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,439
Tell him I asked you to come here.

651
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,034
Don't tell him you want to leave.

652
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,599
Tighter.

653
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,392
Don't take it badly.

654
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,115
Balsan is easygoing. You're lucky.

655
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,508
Make the most of it.

656
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,439
Lucky?

657
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,273
Hungry?

658
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,433
Muffins.

659
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,993
Perfectly tasteless.

660
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,479
The English adore them.

661
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,629
Boy, what about all that coal
you had me buy?

662
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,950
Because with all due respect...

663
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,269
...war is brewing.

664
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,956
-I hope so. I'll resell it for a fortune.
-Buying coal?

665
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,588
I think Mr. Capel would do anything...

666
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,399
...to become England's
leading businessman.

667
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,675
Sell my coal. I pay you well.

668
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,398
Without his advice...

669
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,676
...I'd have to work, like Montlaur.

670
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,229
Montlaur, what a clod.

671
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,279
Work is a vile word.

672
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,751
Worse ways to make a living.

673
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,150
Yes, but none more tiring.

674
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,435
Mr. Burton is here.

675
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,675
The breeder from Cardiff. Let's go.

676
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,633
-Coming?
-I'll join you.

677
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,156
You'd better.
Because my English is shoddy...

678
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,073
...and Heart of Darkness
is a horse for me.

679
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,754
By the way, don't frighten her.

680
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,478
She has the annoying habit of...

681
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,392
...vanishing.

682
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,034
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

683
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,311
Aren't you happy here?

684
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,318
You should go.

685
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,516
It seems you're indispensable.

686
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,999
Why won't you answer?

687
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,750
If I had to answer every question....

688
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,391
Do you work or just pretend to?

689
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,519
You tell me.

690
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,079
No one works here.

691
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,676
Perhaps I'd like to have pretended.
I had no choice.

692
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,398
My mother was lacking...

693
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,879
...a little something...

694
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,600
...so my father would marry her.

695
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,988
An aristocratic name...

696
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,236
...as you say in France.

697
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,152
I was raised by foreign hands.

698
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,477
Don't make that face.

699
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,275
Do I seem unhappy?

700
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,072
Otherwise, I'd never have...

701
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,471
...read a book,
traveled or learned anything.

702
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,874
But perhaps you'd like me more.

703
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,352
It's too austere.

704
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,112
You asked for orphan garb.

705
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,192
What do you know?
Orphans wears rags.

706
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,960
Poor things are half naked.

707
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,952
Rip my dress a bit.

708
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,712
Please.

709
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,995
You're no fun.

710
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,549
The point is to see thighs, breasts.

711
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,632
It's more exciting to imagine them.

712
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,199
Stubborn as an ass.

713
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,998
Gabrielle?

714
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,233
You're beautiful.

715
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,799
It's nice to see you.

716
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,757
How do I look?

717
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,195
Plain.

718
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,399
Who wants to be plain?
This is a disaster.

719
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,679
-Still the boy?
-Less disorienting for you.

720
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,910
And I stuck to horse dung.

721
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,552
Can you fix this? It's too baggy.

722
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,517
It's to let you move about.

723
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,434
I can feel my fat jiggling inside.
I want it tighter.

724
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,955
You'd prefer not to breathe?

725
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,829
She has an answer for everything.

726
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,550
Good-looking pirate.

727
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,472
Hello.

728
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,832
Captain John Rackham.

729
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,195
What can I do for you?

730
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,191
Nothing.

731
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,515
I don't believe in your happiness.

732
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,231
All I need is a job.

733
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,388
You must have one with all that coal.

734
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,994
Nothing really suited for a woman.

735
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,754
What's the point
in being a businessman?

736
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,114
To impress you.

737
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,791
Who do you think you are?

738
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,394
Caught one.

739
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,191
Caught one.

740
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,391
Ooh!

741
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,153
Caught one.

742
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,151
And what a catch.

743
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,872
Stop, Hubert. I'm not playing.
That's enough.

744
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,508
It's a dormitory here. So quiet.

745
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,470
You were right.
My orphan outfit drives them wild.

746
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,191
Ever been in love?

747
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,590
It never made me happy.

748
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,518
What is it like?

749
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,195
What do you feel? Good, bad, what?

750
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,354
Where did you come from?

751
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,591
What's it like to be in love?

752
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,357
It hurts. Hurts. Hurts, doesn't it?

753
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,637
What are you doing?

754
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,869
I'm leaving.

755
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,758
But the game's not over.

756
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,512
I have no business here.

757
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,069
You do. Balsan is counting on you.

758
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,470
You know exactly why I'm here.

759
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,870
You can't go off in the night.

760
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,430
At least wait till daybreak.

761
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,272
Goodnight, Gabrielle.

762
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,677
Stay a bit.

763
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,199
Why should l?

764
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,317
I'm not used to undressing boys.

765
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,679
Look who it is.

766
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,673
Let's have some coffee.

767
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,079
Where's your eye patch?

768
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,151
I lost it in a brawl.

769
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,833
My friend...

770
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,798
...you missed a wild game
of hide-and-go-seek.

771
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,838
Émilienne was great.
She bit a servant.

772
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,558
Seen Coco by any chance?

773
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,280
She hid so well I never found her.

774
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,516
Does she often disappear?

775
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,155
No.

776
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,878
It's rather recent.

777
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,758
Are you fond of her?

778
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,191
Since when do you care?

779
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,511
Since yesterday.

780
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,432
She's a charming companion.
Very pleasant.

781
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,318
Mind if I borrow her for two days?

782
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,191
Like her that much?

783
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,232
I like her.

784
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,556
Does she want to go with you?

785
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,792
I think so.

786
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,232
Then be my guest.

787
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,715
It'll clear her head.

788
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,915
First time I've seen the sea.

789
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,793
Showing off her silverware.

790
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,559
Her dress is so tight,
she'll split in two.

791
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,591
These meringues on their heads.

792
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,389
Like being in a pastry shop.

793
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,159
I'm embarrassed for them.

794
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,958
You're an anarchist.

795
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,031
A good sense of distaste.

796
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,111
You didn't make that up.

797
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,316
It's Jules Renard.

798
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,598
New reading habits.

799
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,272
Tonight...

800
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,635
...we'll go dancing at the casino.

801
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,357
You don't mind being seen with me?

802
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,556
What a strange idea.

803
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,514
I don't have a dress for that.

804
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,713
Make a more elegant version of this one.

805
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,237
What about a color that's really a color?

806
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,835
This is perfect.

807
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,278
The fabric is even more beautiful
in pink.

808
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,954
Better suited for your complexion.

809
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,793
Only black shows off the eyes.

810
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,875
-I'll take this lace too.
-Perfect.

811
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,191
-Make the neckline 10 centimeters lower.
-Mm-hm.

812
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,395
And no corset.

813
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,835
Without a corset it will be shapeless.

814
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,911
In that case, add a belt.

815
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,593
Do as I say.

816
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,672
Very well.

817
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,190
Every woman is looking at you.

818
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,669
No, they're looking at you.

819
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,716
You're very beautiful.

820
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,237
I'll kidnap you as soon as I return.

821
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,912
Not even saying goodbye?

822
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,234
A real racecar.

823
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,435
May l?

824
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,318
Go ahead.

825
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,955
Impressive.

826
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,997
Careful, you may get hooked.

827
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,996
How was the trip?

828
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,832
Did you enjoy yourselves?

829
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,553
What did you do?

830
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,393
I thought you were a very busy man.

831
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,675
Worried?

832
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,832
No, not worried.

833
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,149
I cleared my head.

834
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,239
She may not seem it,
but she's fragile.

835
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,550
Don't play games with her.

836
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,992
I know.

837
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,275
Does she know?

838
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,192
Etienne.

839
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,755
It's up to me to tell her.

840
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,389
Charming scene, isn't it?

841
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,751
You with your hats, me watching.

842
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,275
Peaceful image of a happy couple.

843
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,269
To think you were off
with another man.

844
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,678
How was Deauville?

845
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,714
Nice.

846
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,029
Especially the sea.

847
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,359
What did you do?

848
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,794
We went dancing.

849
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,438
He's not ashamed of me.

850
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,320
In England,
we'd dance with the Queen.

851
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,357
I saw fishermen hauling in their nets.

852
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,318
Men in blue with their shiny catches.

853
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,398
I'll take you to the sea.

854
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,152
Show you real fishing.

855
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,318
You never leave your castle.

856
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,675
You're wrong. I love the sea.

857
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,114
Not so long ago...

858
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:09,874
...I harpooned a shark
from an old boat in England.

859
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,076
I don't believe you at all.

860
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,795
Ask him.

861
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,548
Boy?

862
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,597
Four years ago, to be precise.

863
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,509
What was he like?

864
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,830
Not handsome, but...

865
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,274
...charming.

866
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,670
Not you, him.

867
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,990
Irresistible, of course.

868
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,439
We were all very jealous.

869
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,830
He stole our mistresses...

870
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,357
...but always with such elegance.

871
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,830
That's what we like
about English charm.

872
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,353
Elegance.

873
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,514
Was he often in love?

874
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,432
Heh-heh. No.

875
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,955
But they were.

876
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,873
It led to some awful scenes.

877
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,390
He left a trail of broken hearts.

878
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,073
France, England.

879
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,595
Wherever there was an ocean, a sea.

880
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,314
I don't know why...

881
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,948
...but whenever he gets infatuated...

882
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,270
...he takes the girl to the seaside.

883
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,157
Strange, isn't it?

884
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,515
You're jealous.

885
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,597
Terribly so.

886
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,273
Gabrielle? What are you doing here?

887
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,919
I had to see you.

888
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,559
Come in.

889
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,470
So, what's so important?

890
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,509
In "The Love Room," remember
why Blanche travels the world?

891
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,079
She loved the prince.

892
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,315
Exactly.

893
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,317
No, not you.

894
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,914
I don't know what's gotten into me.
I feel so stupid.

895
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,119
I want to get married.

896
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,438
Gabrielle.

897
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,789
What do his folks say?

898
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,315
He's a self-made man.

899
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,757
You're lucky.

900
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,591
You've never been prettier.

901
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,674
Maurice's folks won't meet me.

902
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,432
Not over their dead bodies.

903
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,272
So let them die.

904
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,198
Almost there.

905
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,592
Careful.

906
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,792
It's yours.

907
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,157
It's the love of your life.

908
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,672
Exactly.

909
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,229
Mm-hm?

910
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,479
I can't take Snow White.

911
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,798
Of course you can.

912
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,596
I'm leaving.

913
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,599
Sorry to....

914
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,389
I'm smiling
because I let the fox into the coop.

915
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,751
But my moodiness tires you.

916
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,913
Don't rush into this.

917
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,039
What's gotten into you?
You used to lock me in a closet.

918
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,672
I was a total idiot.

919
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,436
This is your home.

920
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,991
You'll live in England?

921
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,039
I guess so.

922
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,553
You don't know?

923
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,950
There or elsewhere.

924
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,033
For better or for worse.

925
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,154
One way of putting it.

926
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,315
It hurts a bit, all the same.
Is that normal?

927
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,197
You'll get over it.

928
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,276
Of course.

929
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,549
In fact, no.

930
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,276
I don't want you to leave.

931
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,560
I'm afraid. Afraid you'll be unhappy.

932
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,473
Afraid you'll suddenly lose everything.

933
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,789
Why do you say that?

934
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,715
It's not for me to tell you.

935
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,950
Boy is marrying an Englishwoman.

936
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,796
That's nonsense.

937
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,074
No.

938
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,755
Marrying for money.
He was born a bastard and she's rich.

939
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,230
Her father is an English coal magnate.
I'm sorry, Coco.

940
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,559
What made me think
you had become a gentleman?

941
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,633
Coco.

942
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,193
Open up.

943
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,237
Open up, please.

944
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,313
Coco.

945
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,277
Forget what I told you.

946
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,713
Coco.

947
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,518
I'm sorry.

948
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,073
Open up.

949
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,592
Coco?

950
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,111
Ooh. Very chic in that
striped thing, darling.

951
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,033
This is Sophie, from the Follies.

952
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,954
She can't believe
a wild child makes my hats.

953
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,998
She's willing to spend a fortune
for one.

954
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,355
I said the chances were slim...

955
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,438
...but we brought you a few models
just in case.

956
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,318
What do you think?

957
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,069
We're in the garden. Coming?

958
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,919
I'll join you.

959
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,238
Take your time.

960
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,279
Hello, Gabrielle.

961
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,390
What's your country like?

962
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,790
Vast, green, gray...

963
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,757
...very rainy.

964
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,558
What's on your mind?

965
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,998
My sister.

966
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,317
Beautiful woman.

967
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,391
For what it's worth.

968
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,793
She still thinks her baron
will marry her.

969
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,152
They're in love.

970
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,799
Maybe they don't need
to get married.

971
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,238
That's usually how it works.

972
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,156
It has nothing to do with love.

973
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,357
Marriage is more
of a social convention.

974
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,950
So why did Balsan ask me to marry him?

975
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,918
-You can't.
-Why not?

976
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,510
I'd achieve social status.

977
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,958
If you marry him...

978
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,314
...you give up everything.

979
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,879
Riding horses and entertaining guests?

980
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,195
No.

981
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,189
An exceptional future awaits you.

982
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,793
You and your big words.

983
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,598
You're like no one else.

984
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,035
You have to trust yourself.

985
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,839
Anyway, I don't intend to marry him.

986
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,913
I always knew I'd be no one's wife.

987
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,559
Not even yours.

988
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,873
It's just that sometimes I forget.

989
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,038
My mother was an idiot.

990
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,391
She married for love.

991
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,472
And cried her whole life.

992
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,515
My father cheated on her constantly.

993
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,196
She'd sit up waiting night after night.

994
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,870
One morning he came home...

995
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,077
...and she was there in bed.

996
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,351
In fact, she was dead.

997
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,074
Better a mistress than a wife.

998
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,713
The worst thing in a marriage
is the couple.

999
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,638
Are you shocked?

1000
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,917
I'm getting married.

1001
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,398
Congratulations.

1002
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,833
She's English.

1003
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,596
-The daughter of...
-I know.

1004
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,317
Nothing between us will change.

1005
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,352
How wrong you are.

1006
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,912
Not playing?

1007
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,912
Here she is.

1008
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,914
I'm moving to Paris.

1009
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,433
What will you do there?

1010
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,679
Make my fortune.

1011
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,230
Can we know...

1012
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,198
...what great idea
will make us rich and famous?

1013
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,952
I'll design hats.

1014
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,553
Excellent idea.

1015
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,518
You can do it here.
I'll pay your expenses.

1016
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,911
Hats for your girlfriends
won't make me rich.

1017
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,231
You can't expect to work.
It makes no sense.

1018
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,992
What do you think?

1019
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,393
I think she's right.

1020
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,349
Over in England...

1021
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,795
...you may make women work,
but here...

1022
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,520
...there's still a semblance
of gallantry.

1023
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,873
She can't even add.

1024
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,314
She'll learn.

1025
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,189
She has no money.

1026
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,873
What about that?

1027
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,350
I'll get by. I'll borrow some.

1028
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,038
Stop filling her head with ideas.

1029
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,629
I'll marry you.

1030
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,630
It'll solve all your problems.

1031
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,272
Make all the hats you want.

1032
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,034
I'll confront my family of barbarians.

1033
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,269
I have no intention
of marrying anyone.

1034
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,072
At least it's clear.

1035
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,397
The money you need...

1036
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,070
...I'll give it to you.

1037
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,519
I'll ruin you.

1038
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,874
I'm not so sure.

1039
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,718
So it's decided.

1040
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,998
You're abandoning me.

1041
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,872
You'll come visit.

1042
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,398
I'll miss you.

1043
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,959
Me too.

1044
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,790
What will I do without you?

1045
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,998
I'm frightened.

1046
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,433
Adrienne.

1047
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,680
Look. A gentleman.

1048
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,118
Finish up.

1049
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,597
It's so easy to undress you.

1050
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,195
See you later.

1051
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,475
Stay.

1052
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,358
Émilienne's hats aren't ready.

1053
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,590
I'm getting sick of your hats.

1054
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,876
Leave less and you'd see me more.

1055
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,876
I may have found the house.

1056
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,875
-Where is it?
-Near Cannes. Not far from the sea.

1057
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,359
I'm seeing it tomorrow.

1058
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,916
-Oysters, madame?
-Mademoiselle.

1059
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,073
A two-month rental.

1060
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,708
Two months. I can't believe it.

1061
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,158
We'll fight like hell.

1062
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,319
I'll take the risk.

1063
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,748
One of your hats?

1064
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,199
The rent is on me.

1065
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,149
I thought I gave you a toy.
I gave you your freedom.

1066
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,993
You could have married a celebrity...

1067
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,158
...instead of a lady
in a dusty old castle.

1068
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,312
We'd have been happy.

1069
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,439
Because we're not?

1070
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,479
Go on, try it.

1071
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,552
-Out of the question.
-I need your opinion.

1072
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,756
Get behind the wheel.

1073
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,433
Brake.

1074
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,475
Brake. You'll kill us.

1075
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,829
Not bad.

1076
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,195
You need one yourself. With a driver.

1077
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,873
Okay, I'll buy one.

1078
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,794
Let's wait. I'm not sure
we have enough in the bank.

1079
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,234
We?

1080
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,278
I made that money in the bank.
It's mine.

1081
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,830
They give you money
because I acted as guarantor.

1082
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,151
-So I depend on you.
-For the time being.

1083
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,879
Gabrielle?

1084
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,715
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be negotiating with the bank.

1085
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,120
"Proud people
breed sad sorrows for themselves."

1086
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,077
I don't understand.

1087
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,119
You're too proud.
You're going to suffer.

1088
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,674
"Bodily labor
lessens the pains of the mind.

1089
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,434
This is what makes
poor people happy."

1090
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,431
"Poor people happy."

1091
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,716
An invention of the rich.

1092
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,673
Great. Now you're ready
for Nietzsche.

1093
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,798
Did you take my blue polo shirt?

1094
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,708
You know the difference between us?

1095
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,075
I'm a man. You're a woman.

1096
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,757
Men and women dress differently.

1097
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,952
Can't you leave this one alone?
I can get them only in England.

1098
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,872
What's the material?

1099
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,272
Jersey.

1100
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,117
You're impossible.

1101
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,038
Help me.

1102
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,111
Or I'll never get out of here.

1103
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,115
Why the wait? Let's get going.

1104
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,876
-I have to go.
-Start her up.

1105
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,956
I'm sick of seeing you leave.

1106
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,519
This time I'm coming.

1107
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,759
In that outfit?

1108
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,358
I'll be back tomorrow.

1109
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,511
Then two months, just for us.

1110
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,434
Sixty days.

1111
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,031
Sixty nights.

1112
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,554
You'll regret not taking me along.

1113
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,510
Save your saliva.
I know what's coming. I got groped.

1114
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,592
Yes, you got groped.

1115
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,637
It's so dreadfully predictable.

1116
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,233
First I act like a girl...

1117
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,356
...then you say I'm a beast...

1118
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,238
...then you break something.

1119
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,551
Speaking of which,
I recommend this vase.

1120
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,317
You almost broke it
one night six weeks ago.

1121
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,993
It's ready and waiting.

1122
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,719
You reversed the order.

1123
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,348
Finally a change in the program.

1124
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,557
Enough. Don't exasperate me.
You misbehaved.

1125
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,119
Next comes "Dirty Beast."

1126
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,035
You've acted...

1127
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,394
Like a girl.

1128
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,830
These hats don't stay in place.

1129
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,956
Now maybe you'll overact less.

1130
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,310
As for the man in question...

1131
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,072
...if I held my tongue...

1132
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,710
...it's because I had my reasons.

1133
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,755
Theater is such a bore.

1134
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,997
Why did you cut your hair?

1135
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,912
It got in my way.

1136
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,153
You know the saying:

1137
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:44,189
A woman who cuts her hair
is about to change her life.

1138
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,399
Will you dine with me?

1139
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,357
I'd love to.

1140
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,997
Boy had a car accident.

1141
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,278
Is he in the hospital?

1142
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,559
For 60 years, Coco Chanel's creations
defined the modern woman.

1143
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,473
The era's greatest celebrities
adopted her style.

1144
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,359
She was the first woman
to break into a man's world...

1145
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,875
...founding an empire
which still bears her name.

1146
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,712
She never married.

1147
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,553
She worked up until her death
in January, 1971.

1148
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,075
It was a Sunday, the day of rest...

1149
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,232
...a day she never liked.

1150
