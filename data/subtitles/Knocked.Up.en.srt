1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,464
Light your nuts on fire.

2
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,467
Fuck! Fuck! My hands!

3
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,553
Too hot for Jonah!

4
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,055
I got fucking water in my mouth!

5
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,701
Oh, my God!

6
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,668
I got to get off! I got to get off!
Got to get off! Got to get off!

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,104
Sadie, wake up!

8
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,607
Oh, my gosh!

9
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,484
Daddy, wake up!

10
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,571
Okay, I'm up.

11
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,664
Is that my genius over here?
Is that my genius?

12
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,879
I need you to take the kids
to school this morning.

13
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,882
- I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
- What?

14
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,302
Yeah. I got an appointment with a trainer.
I can't cancel it now. He'll charge me.

15
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,012
- You didn't tell me that.
- Yeah, I did.

16
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,972
- Last week I told you.
- You didn't tell me.

17
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,683
I did. And then I wrote it on the
calendar like you told me to.

18
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:23,935
No, you didn't tell me.

19
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,895
- I did tell you.
- Well, you didn't,

20
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,689
but what are we gonna do,
'cause I have an appointment?

21
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,651
So you're taking the kids to school.

22
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,779
Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.

23
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,114
I can drive them. I'll drive them
to school.

24
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,450
- Thank you very much.
- Great. Good.

25
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,410
You turned my sister into a limo driver.

26
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,895
- I don't mind.
- It all worked out!

27
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,546
What are you giggling about?

28
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:56,259
Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me.

29
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,012
- Poo poo.
- Ladies. Be nice.

30
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,764
- You know what I did the other day?
- What?

31
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,684
- I googled "murder."
- You googled "murder"?

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,102
- Yeah.
- Why?

33
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,520
I mean, what did it say?

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,689
It didn't say anything.
It just showed pictures

35
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:15,319
of people lying dead on the floor
and blood everywhere, and...

36
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,613
That was just ketchup.

37
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,157
- Who wants to hear some music?
- I want to hear Rent.

38
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,410
I want to hear Green Day!

39
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,036
No, we're listening to Rent!

40
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,788
Well, I want to listen
to Green Day.

41
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,582
I got your baby!

42
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,084
- Don't taunt her. Come on.
- Here.

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,504
Sadie! Why did you just do that?
Don't throw things at your sister!

44
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,797
She hit me.

45
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,133
- Did you hit her?
- I did not.

46
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,051
Make her happy. It's okay.

47
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,970
- It won't make her happy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

48
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,471
She spilled all the marbles on the floor.

49
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,796
Well, give her her marble back.

50
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,976
All right? Are you sure you understand
the terms of the bet?

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,145
- Because this is serious.
- No.

52
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,397
Martin, all right, listen.

53
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,901
You don't shave your beard
or cut your hair for one year,

54
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,153
and if you can do that,
I will pay your rent.

55
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,990
But if you shave, then you have to pay
all five of our rents.

56
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,436
Thanks for the free money, bitch.

57
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,660
Hey, Martin, was it weird
when you joined the Taliban,

58
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,495
being American and everything like that?

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,831
Like when you see a woman driving
a car, do you just get pissed?

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,556
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know who your friends are.

61
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,942
Okay, all right. You guys can't make
fun of me the whole time.

62
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,090
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called, "The Dirty Man Competition."

63
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,009
We're gonna make fun of you
until you shave the beard.

64
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,260
- That's the rules.
- That's the whole point.

65
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,845
You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.

66
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,771
Your face looks like Robin
Williams' knuckles.

67
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,517
You guys aren't allowed to make fun
of me. It's not part of the rules.

68
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,524
Martin, why didn't you just listen to
me when I was explaining the rules?

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,856
You just looked at me with that
blank stare of yours.

70
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,525
It was like talking
to a wax statue.

71
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,946
Okay, guys, are you ready?

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,117
So, "Only at fleshofthestars.com will
customers be able to find"

73
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:50,289
"exactly how long into what movies their
favorite stars are exposed."

74
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,791
- Nice.
- Oh, fucking brilliant.

75
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,959
Pretty good, right?

76
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,627
- Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching.
- We're in.

77
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,545
All right, guys,
let start logging, all right?

78
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,472
Charles Manson? Do you have
any other thoughts?

79
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,387
Good, awesome, let's start this off
with a bang.

80
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,970
Jamie Lee Curtis. I got an hour and
10 minutes into Trading Places.

81
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,888
Both chesticles.

82
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,560
I got Julianne "Red Beard" Moore.

83
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,815
Short Cuts, two hours,
17 minutes, bush no boobs.

84
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,499
- Julianne Moore special.
- She loves it.

85
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,567
I've seen that,

86
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,821
and from the look of her bush, Short Cuts
is the wrong name for that movie.

87
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,990
- Nice.
- Nice. Nice. Well done.

88
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,993
Her bush looks like the hedge maze
from The Shining but red

89
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,995
and without Scatman Crothers in it.

90
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,751
Red Bush.

91
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,922
So if you want that perfect tan
like the stars, he's the one to see.

92
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,258
We'll be right back on E! News.
Stay with us.

93
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,094
Okay. Okay, is Jessica Simpson
here yet?

94
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,221
Let me check. Let me see.

95
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,724
- Is she on her way? She's left her house?
- Hey, guys?

96
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,100
Okay, let me know when she's pulling in.

97
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,768
- She's about to pull in.
- Is she camera-ready?

98
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,978
Is she camera-ready?

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,939
If she's gonna be in hair and makeup
for three hours, I can't do it.

100
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,983
I'm not gonna be here.
I got to do American Idol.

101
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,485
It's live. I got to do it.
I got to be there.

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,612
- What are we gonna interview her about?
- Nothing personal.

103
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,457
- No personal questions.
- No personal questions.

104
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,074
Don't ask her about her sister
and her nose job.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,492
- No plastic surgery questions.
- No plastic...

106
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,660
No personal questions.

107
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,456
She doesn't want to talk about her boobs
or her father's comments about her boobs.

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,460
Great. We'll talk about the Middle East
and maybe an idea of an exit strategy.

109
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,669
Maybe she has a good pitch.

110
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,296
Should I ask her about Korea?

111
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,174
Maybe have her point it
out to us on a globe?

112
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,634
I don't understand
the young talent in this town!

113
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,471
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.

114
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,765
Hell, I'm more famous than half the people
we talk to, anyway!

115
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,932
No one stands up.

116
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,100
No one has the balls
to sit them down

117
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,393
and say, "Look, just cut the shit."

118
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,638
But everybody works for them.

119
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,688
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!

120
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:42,026
Nobody sits them down, eye-to-eye,
one-on-one, and says, "Cut the shit."

121
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,652
And all these stars
just fuck it up.

122
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,780
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!

123
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,448
And it pisses me off.
And now I'm sweating.

124
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,033
Okay, you want to...
You know what?

125
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,868
You want us to just come and get you
when she gets here?

126
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,453
You want to head to
the green room for a minute?

127
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,163
- Just chill out? Okay.
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

128
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,748
Want us to bring you anything?
You want some water?

129
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,666
- You want a cookie?
- Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.

130
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,710
- Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm pissed.

131
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,212
What do we got?
Chocolate chip?

132
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,421
- Allison?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,131
Jack and I need
to see you in his office.

134
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,299
Okay.

135
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,011
Thanks for coming in, Allison.

136
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,930
Well, we wanted
to talk to you today

137
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:16,227
because we had a little debate on the
conference call with New York about you.

138
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,480
You... About me?
You were talking about me?

139
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,067
We were wondering
aloud to one another

140
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,070
whether or not you would
be good for on camera.

141
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,947
What'd you decide?

142
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,951
They... They decided
that they like you,

143
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,372
and they would like
to put you on camera.

144
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,458
- Really?
- I know. I was so surprised, too.

145
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,169
Oh, my God. This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.

146
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,797
- This is great!
- Congratulations.

147
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,633
Thank you. I'll take that smile
as a "Yes, I'll do it."

148
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,969
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.

149
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,429
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.

150
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,849
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.

151
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,725
About the work,
most immediately,

152
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,019
there's gonna be some things that you're
gonna be able to get...

153
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,397
- Okay.
- ...that other people in the office don't get.

154
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,357
One of them, gym membership.

155
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,650
You want me to lose weight?

156
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,361
No, I don't
want you to lose weight.

157
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,822
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.

158
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,242
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.

159
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,451
Tight.

160
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,580
A little tighter?

161
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,582
Just like toned and smaller.

162
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,377
Don't make everything smaller. I don't
want to generalize that way.

163
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,628
Tighter.

164
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,233
We don't want you to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.

165
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,342
- Okay.
- You know, by eating less.

166
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,471
We would just like it if you go home
and step on the scale

167
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,975
and write down how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.

168
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,895
- Twenty.
- And then weigh that much.

169
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,648
Just remember, you've got it here,
you've got it here

170
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,860
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.

171
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,280
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!

172
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,449
Hey!

173
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,617
Huh?

174
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,076
I got a promotion.

175
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,745
- Oh, congratulations!
- Thank you.

176
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,246
Hey, maybe you can
get your own place now.

177
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,123
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

178
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,708
- Yay!
- Let's go celebrate.

179
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,460
Okay. Let's do it.

180
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,253
- Pete'll watch the kids?
- Yeah!

181
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,172
We can watch
Taxicab Confessions.

182
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,840
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know!

183
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,885
I'm so excited!

184
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,138
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.

185
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,390
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?

186
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,601
Did he freeze or did he finish?

187
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,688
No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't
doing anything under the covers.

188
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,776
Oh, no!

189
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,071
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.

190
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,365
- Deb and Pete, forever.
- And...

191
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,244
And once he does that into them once,
they're never soft ever again.

192
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,251
I can always tell if I'm looking good based
on whether or not we get in.

193
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,962
- Ladies?
- Guess we're looking good.

194
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,339
- If I didn't get in, I would've lost my shit.
- What's going on, man?

195
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,299
How long you gonna make us wait out here,
for Christ's sake?

196
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,509
What the fuck?

197
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,475
You know what movie I just saw again
the other day, which is fucking, like,

198
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,121
mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it
since it came out is Munich.

199
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,521
Oh, Munich!

200
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,065
- Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
- Munich is awesome!

201
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,318
That movie was Eric Bana
kicking fucking ass!

202
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,612
Dude, every movie with Jews,
we're the ones getting killed.

203
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,156
Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.

204
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,992
Not only killing but fucking,
like, taking names.

205
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,828
If any of us get laid tonight, it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.

206
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,996
I agree with that.
I agree.

207
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,682
You know what is not
helping us get laid

208
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,542
is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid,
over here at our table.

209
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,753
- I don't like your shoes.
- How was Burning Man this year?

210
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,172
Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.

211
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,383
- So are we.
- Yeah, so are we.

212
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,510
Yeah. Fine, screw it.

213
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,887
- You weren't chosen for a reason.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,143
It's like everyone
in here is 12 years old.

215
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,064
- Am I too old to be here?
- What?

216
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,233
- Am I too old to be here?
- No, of course not.

217
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,818
Does it look weird
that I'm here?

218
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,111
No, not at all.

219
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,904
Am I hotter than
these little bitches?

220
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,906
Yes! You look amazing.

221
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,242
- Guys in here would fuck me, right?
- Yes.

222
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,037
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.

223
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,496
You look hot.

224
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,081
Okay. I believe you.

225
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,042
- Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
- Okay.

226
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,918
Yo, a beer over here, please?

227
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,547
You're gonna be embarrassed when you
realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama.

228
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,757
God.

229
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,553
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

230
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,638
He's literally ignoring this entire
half of the bar.

231
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,724
Don't even bother.

232
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,809
Yeah, awesome.

233
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,978
A beer over here, please?

234
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,773
- He looked at us! Did you see that?
- Yeah, that was rough.

235
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, my God. And if you can't get service,
what am I gonna do, you know?

236
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,362
Great. It's gonna be that night.

237
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,864
- Okay, you want a beer?
- Yeah, just...

238
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,116
Well, I'm... Watch this.

239
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,868
Okay? Just observe.

240
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,946
- There you go.
- Come on, man.

241
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,374
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
- Thank you.
- Okay, enjoy it.

243
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,126
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

244
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,463
I tried that once before at the Comedy
Store, and I got punched in the ear.

245
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,798
Thanks a lot.

246
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,384
Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm supposed
to get one for my sister.

247
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,470
- Oh, here, take mine.
- No, that's okay. I'll wait.

248
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,600
Please, I very rarely look cool. This is
a big moment for me. Just take it.

249
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,143
- Thank you. Awesome.
- No problem.

250
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,062
- I'm Allison.
- I'm Ben.

251
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,192
- Well, have a great night.
- Yeah, you, too.

252
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,027
- Thanks for the beer.
- Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.

253
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,406
- Bye. Thanks again.
- I'll see you. No, I'll see you later.

254
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,577
No, I won't 'cause I'm a pussy.

255
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,954
What's up, Ben?

256
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,916
That girl. She totally gave me an
opening, man, and I locked up.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,001
I just want to get shit-faced tonight,
though, you know.

258
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,837
I'll just jerk it later. It's cool.

259
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,924
- Are you fucking crazy, man?
- She looks smart.

260
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,385
- Who's that she's sitting with?
- It's her sister.

261
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,594
- Her sister?
- Yeah.

262
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,013
Dude, it's the dream. What are we doing
standing here, man?

263
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,141
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.

264
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,893
- Why?
- Because your face looks like a vagina.

265
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,603
Dick!

266
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,981
Hey, which one's the sister?

267
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, Crockett, you still partying
with Tubbs these days?

268
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,697
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.

269
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,861
- I don't like it anymore.
- I know. I don't, either.

270
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,910
Was it weird when you changed your name
from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

271
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,287
Yeah, it was really awkward.

272
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,330
All right, man. I got to take off.

273
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,207
See you, Scorsese-on-coke.

274
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,503
What's that?

275
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,172
Chewbacca. You know, it's Chewie.

276
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,257
- Oh, another beard joke.
- Fuck.

277
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Fucking hilarious!

278
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,264
Hi, this is my friend, Jason.

280
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,100
I just wanted to see
how my beers were doing.

281
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,935
This is my sister, Debbie.

282
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,061
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.

283
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,605
- Hi. Ben?
- Yes.

284
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,856
Nice to meet you.

285
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,108
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

286
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,568
Just trying not to stare.

287
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,777
She's married.

288
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,237
Why do you have to say that?

289
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,156
- What?
- It's a shame.

290
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,407
You're beautiful.

291
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,491
Thank you.

292
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,243
She has two kids, too.

293
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,453
Shut up!

294
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,787
What? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

295
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,497
You think that's gonna stop him
from hitting on her?

296
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,124
It's not at all.

297
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,792
I love kids.

298
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,044
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

299
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,088
Excuse me.

300
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,050
- Hello?
- Cool phone.

301
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,593
Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

302
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,512
What? Is it a rash,
or is it the chicken pox?

303
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,182
I don't know! Google it.

304
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,768
Okay. All right, bye.

305
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,063
I got to go. Sadie might
have the chicken pox.

306
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,608
I had the chicken pox three times.
I have no immunity to it.

307
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,693
We don't have the heart
to tell him it's herpes.

308
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,612
It's not herpes
if it's everywhere.

309
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,280
Are you coming?

310
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,453
You know, I'm all dressed,
so I'll just hang out.

311
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,747
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

312
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,627
Okay. Be safe.

313
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,046
I will. Yeah.

314
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,881
- Bye, lovely.
- Bye.

315
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,220
All right, I'm gonna let you
two get to know each other.

316
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,975
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

317
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,393
To you.

318
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,107
No, no. You know, the, like,
Entertainment News channel?

319
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,525
- E!
- E!

320
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,447
Dude, I think he's doing
the dice thing too much.

321
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,242
That's really all he's got.

322
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,747
I love your curly hair!
It's so great.

323
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,082
Do you, like,
use a product or anything?

324
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,543
No, that's...
I use Jew, it's called.

325
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,047
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

326
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,300
You wanna come back
and hang out at my place?

327
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,634
Yes.

328
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,845
- Yeah. Wicked.
- I'll show you my audition tape.

329
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,389
- It's really funny.
- Okay, I'm really excited to watch that.

330
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,682
Let's go.

331
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,603
We could get a cab up,
this way. For sure.

332
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,440
This is a big yard.

333
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,402
Let's go swimming right now.
Let's just do that.

334
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,951
- I know. It feels so right.
- That's right.

335
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,873
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You're prettier than I am.

336
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,374
A lot.

337
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,843
- Do you have a condom?
- I do.

338
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,179
- Okay.
- In my pants. I have a condom.

339
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,014
Okay. Okay.
I'll get it.

340
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,733
Come on.

341
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,779
- Hurry up.
- Stupid fucker.

342
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,075
- What are you doing?
- I almost got it. Just give me a second.

343
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,452
Oh, God, just do it already!

344
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,830
- Okay.
- Oh, great. Okay.

345
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,093
God.

346
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,638
- Oh, that's great!
- Good thing I'm drunk.

347
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,765
- This is lasting forever.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

348
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,600
I just doubled my record time.

349
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,185
Oh, yeah. You did.

350
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,771
- I'm sorry, I'm sweating on you.
- Okay, just stop talking.

351
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,207
Fuck off, Martin.

352
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,377
I said, fuck off, Martin.

353
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,049
Hi.

354
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,677
Oh. Hey.

355
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,220
Hey.

356
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,057
I'm naked.

357
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,142
Yeah.

358
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,853
Did we have sex?

359
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:43,979
Yes.

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,064
Nice.

361
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,945
What time is it?

362
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,029
7:30.

363
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,407
Why the fuck are we awake?
Let's go back to sleep.

364
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,783
I have to go to work.

365
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,285
Really?

366
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,996
Do you need to get
to work or anything?

367
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,040
No, I'm... No work today.

368
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,423
Do you wanna get breakfast?

369
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,591
Okay.

370
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,729
Morning.

371
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,439
Good morning, Allison.

372
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,566
I'm Ben. What's happening, man?

373
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,984
Ben.

374
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,194
How's it going?

375
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,361
Ah, to be young.

376
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,446
Stop it.

377
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,907
You stop it.

378
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,034
Okay, see you later.

379
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,494
All righty.

380
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,121
See you later. Enjoy the day.

381
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,124
Never do what they did.

382
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,876
I'm gonna do it.

383
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,214
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's
getting home-schooled.

384
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,514
I just yacked something nasty.

385
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,975
I feel way better, though. I think that's
like the secret. Like you gotta...

386
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,562
I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.

387
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,772
It feels so... Did you puke?

388
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,023
No.

389
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,691
You can. I won't think
it's gross or anything.

390
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,610
Oh, that's okay, I'm fine.

391
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,153
- Okay.
- I just need some coffee, so...

392
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,655
You know, the best thing
for a hangover is weed.

393
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,741
- Do you smoke... Do you smoke weed?
- Not really.

394
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,950
- You don't?
- No.

395
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,409
- At all?
- Mmm-mmm.

396
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,537
Like in the morning?

397
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,747
No, I just don't.

398
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,000
You know, it's like...
It is like the best medicine.

399
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,794
Because it fixes everything.

400
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,420
Jonah broke his elbow once.

401
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:37,676
He just got high, and it still clicks,
but, I mean, he's okay.

402
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,261
- Right.
- Yeah.

403
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,056
Last night was great,
what I remember of it.

404
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,516
Right, yeah.

405
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,309
Yeah, no, it was fun.
We had a great time.

406
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,769
Yeah.

407
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,271
So what do you do?

408
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,605
I work at E!

409
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,566
- The television channel?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,775
- Remember?
- Wow!

411
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,259
We had this conversation last night.

412
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,863
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.

413
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,533
- No?
- No.

414
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,034
I don't remember that at all.

415
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,411
Yeah. I'm super
excited about it.

416
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,871
I'm actually doing my first
on-air interview today, so...

417
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,665
- With who?
- Matthew Fox.

418
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,041
- Matthew Fox from Lost?
- Yeah.

419
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,543
- You know what's interesting about him?
- What?

420
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,919
- Nothing.
- What?

421
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,754
- Will you tell him he's an asshole for me?
- No.

422
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,840
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?

423
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,093
Well, I hope a lot of people, actually,
because that's what my job entails

424
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,345
is making sure people care
what he has to say.

425
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,180
I'm interviewing him.

426
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,890
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.

427
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,393
I'm just saying
he deserves a beat-down.

428
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,717
Actually, it's sort of embarrassing
to ask at this point,

429
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,772
but what do you do for work?

430
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,234
Me and my roommates have started a...
We're starting an Internet website.

431
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,944
Oh, cool. What is it?

432
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,739
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?

433
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,115
- You're at your computer.
- Mmm-hmm.

434
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,700
Who's an actress you like?

435
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,202
- Mary Tyler Moore?
- No.

436
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,454
- That does not work at all.
- No?

437
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,747
- No.
- Okay.

438
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,500
- Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
- I do.

439
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,918
- Great. Who doesn't?
- Yeah.

440
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,462
Let's say you like her so much

441
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,299
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.

442
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,927
And not just that, but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.

443
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:07,474
You come to our web page exclusively.
Type in "Meg Ryan." Bam!

444
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,395
In the Cut, 38 minutes in, 48 minutes in,
like an hour and 10 minutes...

445
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,105
She's, like, naked that whole
fucking movie.

446
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,232
- She does full frontal in that movie.
- Wow.

447
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,526
- They should've called her Harry, not Sally.
- Really.

448
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,779
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.

449
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,988
- Okay.
- Cool.

450
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,115
Yeah, I actually need
to get going, so...

451
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,828
Well, could... Can I get your number?
I mean, I don't...

452
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,332
We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.

453
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,795
I'm gonna give you my card 'cause
that'll be the best way to...

454
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,007
Well, I mean, if you want to contact me,
I don't have a cell, right now,

455
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,677
because of payment complications.

456
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,054
But, I mean, you can e-mail me
at the web page. I check...

457
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,100
It's just Ben at flesh-of-the-stars,
one word, dot-com.

458
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,518
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

459
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,478
- Okay.
- So, awesome.

460
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,730
All right, then.
Nice to meet you.

461
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,733
- Yeah. Okay.
- Bye. Take care.

462
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,194
See you.

463
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,863
Bye!

464
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,658
That was fucking brutal.

465
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,786
Yeah, that was brutal.

466
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,414
- It was a huge mistake.
- What's a mistake?

467
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,962
Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.

468
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,714
Why did you do it?

469
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,177
Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.

470
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,056
And I was feeling weird because of that.
And I made a...

471
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,381
- I think that's enough.
- Okay.

472
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,602
- Did he wear a condom?
- Yes.

473
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,937
Thank God.

474
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,942
- Do you think you'll do it again?
- No, no way.

475
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,319
She was totally repulsed by me.

476
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,697
- What?
- She just really didn't seem to like me.

477
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,283
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.

478
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,326
- Fucking funny as balls.
- Hilarious, man.

479
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,580
I'm giving her the A shit. Nothing.
She thought our web page was a bad idea.

480
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,665
- What?
- That fucking stuck-up bitch.

481
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, I think so, too.

482
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,924
I think it's awesome
that you had sex with her.

483
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,922
If a goofy guy like you had sex with her,
I feel like I had sex with her also.

484
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,966
I was so drunk. I just wish I
remembered it.

485
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:16,436
Hi, I'm Allison Scott. And we're here today
with James Franco from Spider-Man.

486
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,687
- How are you?
- Great, great.

487
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,052
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

488
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,941
Tell me, were you
a big fan of the...

489
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,194
- I'm sorry, let me take that again.
- Okay.

490
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,863
Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?

491
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,865
No, actually,

492
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,577
I didn't read any of the comic books until
I got the movie and then...

493
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,830
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

494
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,416
Yeah, just what about
the comic books?

495
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,460
Just keep talking.

496
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,713
Like I said,
I really wasn't into them,

497
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,175
but now that I did the research, I think
they're pretty amazing, like...

498
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,471
Shit.

499
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,891
What the fuck?

500
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,856
Is that the sound of you puking?

501
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,818
<i>If this is one of those fucking joke shows,
I'm not into it.</i>

502
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,861
We should put this on YouTube.
Shut up.

503
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,655
- This is hilarious.
- You're an asshole.

504
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,739
Look how sweaty you are.
You look like Dom DeLuise.

505
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,784
I don't need to see it again.
It's gonna make me throw up.

506
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,119
You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.

507
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,458
You're such an asshole.

508
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm just jerking your chain.

509
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,378
I'll fix this. No problem.

510
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,131
Yeah, maybe if you can just
edit this out, and we can...

511
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,385
We can reshoot my questions.

512
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,389
What's up?

513
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,517
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Over here.

514
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,603
Not on the mix board,
not on the mix board, here.

515
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,942
Are you okay?

516
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,738
Oh, my God.

517
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,866
- Are you sick?
- I don't know.

518
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,451
- What'd you eat?
- I haven't eaten today yet.

519
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,537
- You haven't...
- Do you have, like, a napkin or something?

520
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,080
Here, here.

521
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,417
What, do you have,
like, the flu?

522
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,918
I don't know.

523
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,421
God, I hope you're not pregnant.

524
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,966
It's impossible. You have
to have sex to get pregnant.

525
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,305
B. K. It's Brent Master Five.

526
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,974
Allison just puked.

527
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,435
Dude, that's what I said. She's
probably pregnant, right?

528
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,645
- Oh, shit.
- How does she look right now?

529
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,523
She looks like she just realized
that she's pregnant.

530
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,775
No, I can't be
pregnant. Right?

531
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,486
I mean that was, what?

532
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,333
- Eight weeks ago? When was that?
- Mmm-hmm.

533
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,240
Did you miss your period?

534
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,742
No. Wait.

535
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,536
I don't know. Shit. I don't know.
I can't remember.

536
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,622
I was... I mean, I've been
really stressed at work.

537
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,248
I can't remember my last period.

538
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,167
Are you the lady who doesn't
realize she's pregnant

539
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,333
till she's sitting on the toilet
and a kid pops out?

540
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,004
Can you not joke right now?
Don't joke right now.

541
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,006
- This is really serious.
- Did I meet him?

542
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,467
Yeah. You know, he was
kind of like medium height,

543
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,012
sort of chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

544
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,847
- With the man-boobs.
- Yes.

545
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,225
Here, I have this thing of him on my phone.
I just watched it.

546
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,728
<i>Hey! I live in your phone!</i>

547
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,146
Oh.

548
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,733
<i>This is the best night of my life.</i>

549
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>I gotta pee.</i>

550
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,487
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

551
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,949
- How did this happen?
- Oh, shit.

552
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,992
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

553
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,082
They're here!
Here they are! Over here!

554
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,375
Oh, no.

555
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,251
- Okay, here we are.
- Okay.

556
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,629
- Okay. All right.
- Here.

557
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,850
Oh, no. Give me more!
Give me a few more!

558
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,686
Did you try the Ova-Sure?

559
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,189
I'm dripping,
I'm dripping. Wait.

560
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,650
Oh, good! A smiley face!

561
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,944
Oh, I think that's bad.

562
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,321
How long does this one take?

563
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,408
These can't all be positive.
Let me try one.

564
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,207
God, you really had to pee.

565
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,421
What is this?
What the hell is this?

566
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,298
I think you picked up
the wrong one.

567
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,675
Oh, fuck.

568
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,386
That scared me.

569
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,055
That would suck. I'm sorry.

570
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,892
That scared me.

571
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,854
It's gonna be fine. Right?

572
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,606
Right?

573
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,484
Of course it will be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

574
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,986
You just need to call him.

575
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,530
Maybe I don't need to call him
until after I see the doctor.

576
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,032
- You need to call.
- I don't want to call him.

577
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,756
- I don't need to call him.
- You should call.

578
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,161
I can't call him anyway.
He doesn't even have a phone.

579
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,662
He didn't even have
a number to give me.

580
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,788
He doesn't have a phone?

581
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,498
Said he had some
kind of billing issue.

582
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,501
He can't afford a phone?
Sadie has a phone.

583
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,004
Oh, shit, you're right.
I got to call.

584
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,548
I don't know. I'm gonna have to look
him up on his stupid website.

585
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,952
What kind of website
does he have?

586
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,012
He spelled "coming" wrong.
Oh, it's cum...

587
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,222
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's gross.

588
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,266
Just go to "Contact Us."

589
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,852
- Ben?
- Yeah.

590
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,024
"What is your number? I need to speak
with you right away."

591
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,525
- Send?
- Yep.

592
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,152
You're sure?

593
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,487
Yeah.

594
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,783
I love weed.

595
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,951
I could smoke weed
every second of every day.

596
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,121
Jay, I am your stoner.

597
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,673
- Hey, Benjamin?
- Yeah.

598
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,051
- Flesh of the Stars just got an e-mail.
- Really?

599
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,595
- Would you like me to read it to you?
- Yeah, sure.

600
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,972
"Ben, what is your number?"

601
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,518
"I need to speak to you right away.
Allison Scott."

602
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,646
Oh! Shit!

603
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,940
Someone wants seconds, mama!

604
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,274
Oh, man!

605
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,819
"Looking forward to speaking with you."

606
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,864
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do one of those
smiley faces at the end.

607
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,491
- Fucking-A. Those are sexy.
- Sent.

608
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,917
Somebody wants another piece!

609
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,211
Booty-booty call.

610
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,004
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi.

611
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:21,217
Hey, Ben, this is... This is Allison.
I don't know if you remember me.

612
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,886
Oh, yeah, Allison. What's up?

613
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,430
She like the way
your dick tastes.

614
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,726
Yeah, I actually was
just wondering if maybe you

615
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,062
wanted to get together,
like tomorrow night?

616
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,668
I've been meaning to call you so we could,
like, hook up again.

617
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,483
- You know what I'm saying?
- Okay, cool.

618
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,361
Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?
You wanna just grab some dinner?

619
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,157
<i>Yeah. Why not? Meeting of minds
sounds good.</i>

620
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,035
<i>What do you say Geisha House,
Hollywood, 9:00?</i>

621
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,328
Sure, sure. That's cool.

622
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,747
Can we make it more like 6:00, though?
I'd like to keep it early.

623
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,668
6:00. Beat the rush. Yeah, leaves
more time for afterwards.

624
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,295
<i>Dessert. Sweet.</i>

625
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,630
Okay, great.

626
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,508
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.

627
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,552
Yeah. I'll see you there.

628
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,471
Okay, take care. Peace.

629
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,726
Oh, shit.

630
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,521
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!

631
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,441
Yes! Yes!

632
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,320
- Nice place, huh?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

633
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,656
Sorry it took so long to get a table. I
didn't realize you needed a reservation.

634
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,074
Oh, no, that's okay.

635
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,451
- So how's work?
- Great.

636
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,660
- How's E!?
- Great.

637
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,385
That's awesome. Do you know Vince Vaughn?

638
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,622
- Have you ever met him?
- No.

639
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:36,167
I really feel like we'd get along well.
I just... He seems like a fun guy.

640
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,169
- I feel like we'd, like, hang together well.
- Mmm-hmm.

641
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,253
I feel like he'd like me.

642
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,338
I'm sure a lot of guys are like, "Oh, I'd
like to hang out with that celeb",

643
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,424
but I really think he would want to
hang out with me, is like the cool thing.

644
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,261
I'm sure he would. Yeah.

645
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,638
- You look very pretty, though.
- Thanks.

646
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,124
- By the way.
- Yeah, I just thought...

647
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,474
I don't know, I thought
maybe it'd be cool

648
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,683
to hang out a little bit and...

649
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,894
We didn't really get to talk that much
last time, so I thought...

650
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,437
That we didn't.

651
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,442
I thought maybe we'd just talk
and get to know each other better.

652
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,486
Cool. Okay.

653
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:07,073
- I'll start. I'm Canadian.
- Oh, that's cool.

654
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,992
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.

655
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,160
Don't tell anyone.

656
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,121
But it works out in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,

657
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,207
'cause I don't have to pay any taxes.

658
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,585
So financially that's helpful

659
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,213
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.

660
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,425
You know, I mean, I'm not poor or anything,
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.

661
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,805
So, you know, the web page or whatever
is just something that you guys do for fun?

662
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,181
Do you have a real job?

663
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,849
- Well, that is our job.
- Oh.

664
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,061
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,

665
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,562
but it is our job.

666
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,481
- So, how do you... Right.
- How do I pay rent and shit?

667
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,692
When I was in high school, I got ran over
by a postal truck.

668
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,978
- Oh, my God.
- It just kind of...

669
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,695
It was my foot
more than anything.

670
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,824
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.

671
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,534
- Right.
- And that really lasted me.

672
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,952
I mean, until now.

673
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,204
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.

674
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,040
So that should last me for, like, I mean,
I'm not a mathematician,

675
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,543
but like another two years or
some shit. I think.

676
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:01,711
Yeah.

677
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,754
So I have something
I really need to tell you.

678
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,507
It's kind of why I called you.

679
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,551
Here goes. Um...

680
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,469
I'm pregnant.

681
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,096
- Fuck off.
- What?

682
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,015
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

683
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,350
With emotion?

684
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,853
With a baby. You're the father.

685
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,689
- I'm the father?
- Yes.

686
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,232
- How the fuck could this happen?
- I don't know.

687
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,317
I don't know. I mean, I thought you were
wearing a condom.

688
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,527
- No.
- What?

689
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,070
- I wasn't.
- Why not?

690
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,405
Because you told me not to.

691
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,906
What are you talking about?

692
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,825
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.

693
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,369
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.

694
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,579
Here's what happened, okay?

695
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,123
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.

696
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,875
I almost had the condom on my dick.

697
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,045
It was on the cusp, and then you said,
"Just do it, already."

698
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,463
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.

699
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,298
I meant "do it" like "hurry up,"

700
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,507
like "Get fucking going!"

701
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,052
Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam

702
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,471
or one of those fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.

703
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,306
- What the hell is a dental dam?
- It's like Saran Wrap!

704
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,683
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.

705
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,648
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?

706
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,104
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!

707
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,647
Obviously, I was drunk!

708
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,024
Was your vagina drunk?

709
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,151
Did you think it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?

710
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,904
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?

711
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,615
He hollowed out a penis and put it on?

712
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,908
What the fuck?

713
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,660
You are unbelievable.

714
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:24,251
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.

715
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,296
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.

716
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,799
I am going to the doctor next week,

717
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,052
and I thought you could come with me
to the gynecologist.

718
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,845
- So you haven't seen him, though?
- No.

719
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,370
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.

720
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,267
- Well, I'm not 100% sure.
- You're not 100 % sure.

721
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,811
I bet you're not pregnant.

722
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,233
No, they're not.

723
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,946
No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.

724
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,540
Allison Scott?

725
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,166
Yeah. Come on.

726
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,252
- I'm supposed to come?
- Yes.

727
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,801
Hello. My name is
Thomas Pellagrino.

728
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,136
I'm... I'm Ben Stone.

729
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,054
Hi, there, champ.
Nice to meet you.

730
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,806
- And you must be Debbie's sister.
- Yeah.

731
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,057
- Alice.
- Allison. Hi.

732
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,059
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

733
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,896
So, what can I help you with today,
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?

734
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,357
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,

735
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,484
so here we are.

736
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,903
Okay. Let's have a look.

737
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,449
Legs up.

738
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,748
Nice office.

739
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,083
Thank you.

740
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,673
Well, you do look
a lot like your sister.

741
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,597
This is gonna be cold.
And you're next.

742
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,693
Okay, there is
the cervix and the uterus.

743
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,945
See that?

744
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,199
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.

745
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,203
And right there
in the middle is the embryo.

746
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,788
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?

747
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,957
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.

748
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,792
Yeah, it looks like
you are pregnant.

749
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,295
About eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.

750
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,963
Congratulations.

751
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,593
That... That's it?

752
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,802
Yep.

753
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,679
Take good care of it.

754
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,308
Now the fun part starts.

755
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,145
Let me... Let me make
a picture for you, huh?

756
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,730
That'll be fun.

757
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,528
Okay. Well, I'll...
I'll meet you in my office.

758
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,822
Okay.

759
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,618
I'll give you
a little time alone, there.

760
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,666
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

761
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,919
It's okay.

762
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,421
I can't fucking believe
you didn't wear a bag!

763
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,631
Who does that?

764
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,800
Why did we go to Costco and buy
a year's supply of condoms

765
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,051
if you weren't gonna
use them, man?

766
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,095
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.

767
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,389
Look, the real point is not to get
yourself in this position.

768
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,807
That's what you have to realize.

769
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,975
You gotta know all the tricks.

770
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,539
Like, for example, if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.

771
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,729
- It's just gravity.
- Well, that's true. Everyone knows that.

772
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,189
What goes up must come down.

773
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,359
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.

774
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:39,446
Think about it like this. It's just an
excuse to play with all your old toys again.

775
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,031
You know what
I think you should do?

776
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,075
Take care of it.

777
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,494
Tell me you don't want him
to get an "A" word.

778
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,414
Yes, I do, and I won't say it for
little Baby Ears over there,

779
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,874
but it rhymes with "Shma-shmortion."

780
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,210
I'm just saying... Hold on, Jay,
cover your ears.

781
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:57,006
You should get a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.

782
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,509
Ben, you cannot let these monsters have
any part of your child's life.

783
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,470
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.

784
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,264
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.

785
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,683
He wants to rear your child!

786
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,101
I just have a quick question.

787
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,563
Do you use that Canadian flag tattoo
as a cum target of some sort?

788
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,774
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?

789
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,609
Jonah, I am a patriot.

790
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,362
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.

791
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,614
I always aim right.

792
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,616
Right into a dude's ass.

793
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,912
Please, guys.

794
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,165
- Ben, come on, man.
- I'm just kidding you.

795
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,001
- Oh, great. Now he's upset.
- I won't let him do it.

796
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,337
Allison, just take care of it.

797
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,921
Take care of it. Move on.

798
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,256
What's gonna happen
with your career?

799
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,716
How are you gonna tell them?

800
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,967
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.

801
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,011
I have a while
before I have to say anything.

802
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,135
- How could you not tell them?
- They're not gonna know.

803
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,931
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,

804
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,351
- I don't know, six months or something.
- Seven months.

805
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,935
- Three months.
- No.

806
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,189
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.

807
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,608
Debbie didn't get fat.

808
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,526
Debbie is a freak of nature.

809
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,280
Mom, you know, it's important to me
that you be supportive.

810
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:07,368
I cannot be supportive of this. This is
a mistake. This is a big, big mistake.

811
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,119
Now, think about
your stepsister.

812
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,537
Now, you remember
what happened with her?

813
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,291
She had the same situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.

814
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,378
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.

815
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,380
Honey, this is not the time.

816
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,715
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

817
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,925
You happy about that?

818
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,635
Absolutely. Delighted.

819
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,803
This is a disaster.

820
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,096
No, this is not a disaster.

821
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,723
- It is...
- An earthquake is a disaster.

822
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,809
Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad

823
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,478
she doesn't even know who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.

824
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,480
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.

825
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,484
I have a vision
for how my life would go,

826
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,069
and this definitely is not it.

827
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,905
Wait. Is this your vision? Are you living
your vision right now?

828
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,156
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.

829
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,075
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.

830
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,577
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?

831
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,996
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.

832
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,916
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.

833
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,253
I just don't get how I tell the kid not
to do drugs when I do drugs.

834
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,587
I'll feel like a hypocrite.

835
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,715
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?

836
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,759
- What did you say?
- I said, "No pills, no powders."

837
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,965
That's right, that's right.

838
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,430
Right. If it grows in the ground,
it's probably okay.

839
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,766
I mean, I guess it worked. Like you told
me not to smoke pot all those years,

840
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,853
and then I found out you were smoking pot
that whole time.

841
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,438
Not the whole time.

842
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,274
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.

843
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,942
Not that much.

844
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:27,364
Honestly, though, when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,

845
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,032
"You know, if he just never existed,

846
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,453
"I would have avoided a massive
heap of trouble," you know?

847
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,204
Absolutely not.

848
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,457
I love you totally and completely.

849
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,876
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

850
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,544
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?

851
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,795
Yeah.

852
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,132
Now I just feel bad for you.

853
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,975
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. Ben?

854
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,769
Oh. Hey, Allison.

855
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,898
- How's it going?
<i>- Good, good.</i>

856
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,150
You know, I was just calling to...

857
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,488
To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.

858
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,114
I'm keeping it.

859
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,407
Oh.

860
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:15,162
Yeah. So, that's what's
happening with that.

861
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,748
<i>Good. That's good. That's what
I was hoping you'd do.</i>

862
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,417
So, awesome.

863
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,586
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.

864
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,173
Okay, I know we didn't plan this,

865
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,092
and, you know, neither of us really thought
it was gonna happen,

866
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,677
<i>but life is like that, you know,</i>

867
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,387
<i>you can't plan for it.</i>

868
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,805
<i>And even if we did plan,</i>

869
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,683
<i>life doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily.</i>

870
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,603
<i>And you just kind of have to go
with the flow and, you know,</i>

871
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,857
I know my job is to just support you
in whatever it is you wanna do,

872
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,859
and, I'm in, you know.

873
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,653
<i>So whatever you wanna do,</i>

874
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,530
<i>I'm gonna do, you know. It's...</i>

875
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,033
I'm on board. Yay!

876
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,934
I really appreciate you saying that.

877
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,956
<i>No problem. You know, so I'll tell you,</i>

878
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,543
<i>you know, maybe if you could
help me by telling me, like,</i>

879
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,629
<i>one thing that I am supposed to do,
then that would be good,</i>

880
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,132
<i>because I literally have
no idea whatsoever.</i>

881
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,468
I have no idea, either.

882
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:17,641
So, do you want to, like, get together
and talk about it or something like that?

883
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,560
- Yeah, sure.
<i>- Like a date? I mean...</i>

884
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,019
Yeah.

885
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,405
- Hey.
- Hi.

886
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,657
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

887
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,492
No problem. Come on in.

888
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,620
- Everyone, this is Allison.
- Hi.

889
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,665
- Ally. Hey. Jason, I'm sure you remember.
- Yes.

890
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,166
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

891
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,919
Your body's responding
really well to the pregnancy.

892
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,087
Thank you.

893
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,214
It's amazing how fast the milk arrives.

894
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,674
Oh.

895
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,842
How's your sis?

896
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,051
She's good.

897
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,345
- Oh, good. Tell her, "What's up?" for me.
- Okay.

898
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,098
All right, I'm gonna go make
a protein shake.

899
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,352
And this beautiful young man is Jonah.

900
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,854
- Hi.
- Hey.

901
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,610
Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.

902
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,777
Hi.

903
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,780
I'm gonna grab my shirt.
Just take a seat if you want.

904
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,198
- Okay.
- Cool.

905
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,458
You are scared, aren't you?

906
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,759
- Just another day at the office.
- Uh-huh.

907
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,556
Do you have any acting experience?

908
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,058
No. Uh-huh.

909
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,644
How's it going?
You wanna toke?

910
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,979
No. I'm good.

911
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,147
- Hi.
- Hi.

912
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,483
- I'm Jodi.
- Yeah, hi.

913
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,401
- I heard you were pregnant.
- Mmm-hmm.

914
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,236
Oh, aren't you scared?

915
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,739
The way it's gonna
come out of your...

916
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,825
It's gonna hurt a lot, I bet.
Your vagina...

917
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,994
That's so sick.

918
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,245
I don't know.

919
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,664
Are you hungry?

920
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,749
No, I'm okay right now.
Thank you.

921
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,835
You must be angry at the baby whenever
it steals your food, huh?

922
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,587
"Oh, it's mine, not yours."

923
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,841
But, you know, because you're family,
you got to share.

924
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,009
Right.

925
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,012
Man, my balls are shaved.
My pubes are trimmed.

926
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,431
I'm ready to fucking
rock this shit.

927
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,766
What the fuck, man?

928
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,103
If I go in there and see fucking
pubes sprinkled on the toilet seat,

929
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,105
I'm gonna fucking lose my mind!

930
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,773
Last time I went
to the bathroom, Jay,

931
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,776
I took a shit and my shit looked
like a fucking stuffed animal!

932
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,778
You're embarrassing me
in company.

933
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,279
You embarrass yourself.

934
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,949
Oh, great. I hope you have
a great evening!

935
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,535
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

936
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,120
See you guys later.

937
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,668
The funny thing is I really had never
even thought about having a baby.

938
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,878
- Yeah.
- I mean, if this hadn't happened,

939
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,756
I don't think I would have
wanted to have a baby for like,

940
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,217
- I don't know, at least 10 years.
- At least!

941
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,137
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,

942
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,973
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.

943
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,225
I didn't think
this would happen.

944
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,394
Get ready.

945
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,360
This will be coming out of you
in seven months.

946
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,241
This is exactly what
our baby will look like.

947
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,985
- It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
- It is. It's not bad.

948
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,236
Hello, Mommy.

949
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,904
Our baby's gonna be
French-Canadian.

950
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,230
With a little hint of Spanish.

951
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,411
- Baby books.
- Awesome.

952
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,055
"What to Expect When You're Expecting."

953
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,456
What can we expect?

954
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,375
Well, you can't eat sushi.

955
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,252
You can't smoke.

956
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,756
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.

957
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,507
You can't jump on trampolines.

958
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,302
This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.

959
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,887
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.

960
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,291
I'm gonna be sitting there on the
trampoline smoking crack.

961
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,017
And you're not gonna have anything to do.
You're gonna be bored.

962
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,741
But I can't wait to read these, honestly.

963
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,479
Seriously, I put these in front
of my toilet, though,

964
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,272
they'll be read by tomorrow morning.

965
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,690
- Do you want me to get you that?
- Yeah.

966
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,150
- You like it?
- Yeah, thank you.

967
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,485
No problem.

968
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,236
These are heavy.

969
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,046
So what do you think?
Should we have sex tonight?

970
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,130
Sounds awful.

971
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,802
I'm just really constipated.

972
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,054
Do you really want to?

973
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,472
Well, now...

974
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,973
Shut up.

975
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,934
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.

976
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,435
We have to help her.

977
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,396
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.

978
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,649
We'll help her raise the baby.

979
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,983
Well...

980
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,028
Fuck!

981
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,246
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?

982
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,542
But we can. I don't... I brought some
just in case. I don't...

983
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,044
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...

984
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
It's not that.

985
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,755
You know, it's just...

986
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,385
I thought maybe we could get a little fun
out of your situation, you know?

987
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,346
Okay, first of all, it's not my situation.
It's our situation.

988
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,722
I know, of course, I know that.

989
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,641
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman

990
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,101
and all romance goes out the door.

991
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,144
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

992
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,273
It's just...

993
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,360
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...

994
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,323
I like you, too.

995
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,825
Sweet.

996
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,827
A little, so far.

997
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,911
I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.

998
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,622
- We don't have to rush it.
- Yeah.

999
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,667
We should really just try
to get to know each other

1000
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,669
and give this a real shot.

1001
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,964
You know, we got ourselves into this
situation. We kind of have to.

1002
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,383
- For the baby, right?
- Exactly.

1003
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,347
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?

1004
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:54,311
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...

1005
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:58,440
I told my roommates I thought I
was gonna get a B.J., so...

1006
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,608
You know what?

1007
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,532
For the sake of getting to know one
another, can you not talk like that?

1008
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:06,489
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

1009
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,408
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.

1010
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,076
Yeah.

1011
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,049
You're a sweet guy, right?

1012
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,593
I think I am. Yeah.

1013
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,720
Don't fuck me over, okay?

1014
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,805
I wouldn't do that.

1015
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:35,060
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.

1016
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,270
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.

1017
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,438
- Okay?
- Okay.

1018
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,858
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.

1019
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,626
Who's he?

1020
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,336
I'm Ben Stone.

1021
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,130
He's my boyfriend.

1022
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,759
That's nice.

1023
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,511
I've never met him before.

1024
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,429
Well, he's a new boyfriend.

1025
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,722
But a boyfriend.

1026
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,976
So he came over for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?

1027
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,936
Yeah. He came from his house.

1028
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,688
Drove over to our house

1029
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,607
because he thought it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,

1030
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:26,820
so he drove his car from his house
to our house to have breakfast.

1031
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,030
Because he likes breakfast so much.

1032
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,032
I love breakfast.

1033
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:35,286
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.

1034
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,372
- What?
- Yeah, a baby.

1035
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,790
Well, you're not married.

1036
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,001
Aren't you supposed to be
married to have a baby?

1037
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,293
You don't have to be.

1038
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,629
But they should be because they
love each other,

1039
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:48,258
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.

1040
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,342
Mmm-mmm.

1041
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,428
Do you love each other?

1042
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,848
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.

1043
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,935
When you love each other, you get married
and have a baby.

1044
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,687
Where do babies come from?

1045
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,772
Where do you think
they come from?

1046
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,109
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,

1047
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,278
and then a hole goes
in your body,

1048
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,780
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,

1049
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,200
and then you push your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,

1050
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,370
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,

1051
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,706
and you'll find a little baby.

1052
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,666
That's exactly right.

1053
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,877
Feed the teddy bear.

1054
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,504
Okay, I feed your bear the grass?

1055
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,632
Okay.

1056
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:33,470
You know what your bear would also like
to do with some grass?

1057
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,888
Smoke it.

1058
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,475
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?

1059
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,768
Mmm-hmm.

1060
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,478
Fetch.

1061
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,354
All right, bring it back.

1062
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,191
He's playing fetch with my kids.

1063
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,776
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.

1064
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,235
No, he's not.

1065
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,528
Go get it! Fetch!

1066
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,530
Who plays fetch with kids?

1067
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,741
He's trying. He's making an effort.

1068
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,243
- Bring it back.
- He's overweight.

1069
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,703
Where does that end?

1070
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,580
- How old is he?
- 23.

1071
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,040
Looks 33.

1072
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,376
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.

1073
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,420
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.

1074
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,714
That means he has bad genes.

1075
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,050
Your kid is gonna be overweight.

1076
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,426
Shit.

1077
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,053
I'm gonna get you!

1078
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,430
I'm gonna get...

1079
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,060
Just give him a break.

1080
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,023
Okay. I'll try.

1081
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,157
They seem to love bubbles.

1082
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,369
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.

1083
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,537
They're really going ape shit.

1084
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,123
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.

1085
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,730
I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?

1086
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,962
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.

1087
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,215
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.

1088
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,634
- That's sad.
- It's totally sad.

1089
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,639
Their smiling faces just point out
your inability to enjoy anything.

1090
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,808
Am I gonna be okay, man?

1091
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,644
Oh, who knows?

1092
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,814
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.

1093
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,440
You're asking the wrong guy.

1094
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,610
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?

1095
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,612
Can I just have some?

1096
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,573
No.

1097
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,537
I have 15 years
of tennis lessons.

1098
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,748
And 12 years of sucking dick lessons.

1099
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,916
So?

1100
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,668
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.

1101
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,754
I got to go meet gynecologists
with Allison.

1102
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,840
She doesn't like her gynecologist.

1103
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,342
- You think she likes you?
- She's trying to.

1104
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,096
- She's entertaining the idea of liking you.
- Exactly. I'll take that.

1105
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,599
Yeah, well, see, she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.

1106
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,851
- She must like you.
- Yeah. Pretty good, I think.

1107
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,697
You know who I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.

1108
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,189
Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.

1109
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,525
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,

1110
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,777
but it's kind of business meeting time.

1111
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,196
I need moolah.

1112
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,866
- When do you think we can launch this site?
- Jeez.

1113
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,451
Look, man. You can't rush this.

1114
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,202
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up

1115
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,954
and they don't function well?
They die.

1116
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,541
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.

1117
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,461
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.

1118
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,546
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?

1119
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,382
Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so
I could work 12 hours a day.

1120
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,967
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.

1121
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,636
I went where I went, Jason.

1122
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,554
I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.

1123
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,307
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.

1124
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,271
I'll tell you what, man. We could probably
get it online in three months.

1125
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,978
Thank you. Yes! Three months.

1126
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,897
Come on, Jason!

1127
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,398
Fuck off!

1128
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,901
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.

1129
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,904
- Do you have mints?
- Yeah, right there.

1130
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,906
I see what you're saying. Totally.

1131
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,908
I don't get how you're comfortable
with any of these guys

1132
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,660
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.

1133
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,912
First guy...

1134
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,748
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.

1135
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,834
The first guy, when he put his finger
in, he gave me this look like,

1136
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:56,756
"Sorry, man, it's the job" and I'm like,
"Don't look at me when your finger's..."

1137
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,676
I mean, get in and get out. Get on
with your day, you know?

1138
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,262
That's the closest I'll ever come to
being in a threesome, I think.

1139
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,430
Really?

1140
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,016
If you had to do a threesome with me
and one of my other roommates,

1141
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,685
who would it be?

1142
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:09,769
Um...

1143
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,437
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.

1144
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,772
Oh, no.

1145
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,023
- Yeah.
- Jay?

1146
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,276
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness

1147
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,113
- and his hot little Mohawk.
- His Mohawk.

1148
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,533
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.

1149
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,703
If we ever had a three-way with Jay,
you turn around, he'd be sucking my dick.

1150
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,954
I'm telling you right now.

1151
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,540
- Do you smoke cigarettes?
- No.

1152
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,292
Do you smoke cigarettes?

1153
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,794
I have on occasion.

1154
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,159
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?

1155
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,673
You know, one, you know, little...

1156
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,384
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.

1157
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,721
How you doing?

1158
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,974
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.

1159
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,394
Slow down, man. You're making me look
like a jackass.

1160
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,146
How long you kids been married?

1161
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,564
- We're not.
- No.

1162
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,648
You're single?

1163
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,067
She's not single.
She's just not married.

1164
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,153
Are you two together?

1165
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,406
Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends?

1166
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,826
Just kidding. Kind of.

1167
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:16,169
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.

1168
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,046
That happens about five times a day.

1169
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,762
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?

1170
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,009
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.

1171
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,927
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ally. Bye.

1172
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,347
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.

1173
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,017
I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.

1174
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,687
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!

1175
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,147
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.

1176
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,774
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.

1177
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,525
- Good boobs.
- Those are good ones!

1178
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,402
We're like 35 seconds in. Nice.

1179
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,321
Right in the beginning credits.
Credit bush.

1180
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,927
- You never get opening credit bush.
- I know. That's so crazy.

1181
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,700
No.

1182
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,622
You got me.

1183
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,458
How many doctors are there
in your practice?

1184
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,044
Just 'cause I'm sort of looking for a
more personal experience.

1185
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,297
I wanna make sure that you're my doctor
on the day, and...

1186
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,174
Yeah, I understand.

1187
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:08,054
We have three other doctors in the
practice, but I'm your man, okay?

1188
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,890
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.

1189
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,351
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,

1190
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,812
and I'm never going back.

1191
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,272
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.

1192
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,565
- Really?
- Yeah.

1193
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,900
All right.

1194
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,361
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

1195
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,612
Wow.

1196
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,823
- You look relieved.
- I am very relieved.

1197
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,992
I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.

1198
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,998
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.

1199
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,879
Do they know?

1200
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,089
Pardon?

1201
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,217
The belly.

1202
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,970
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.

1203
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,640
- Hey, Allison. Great job.
- Thanks.

1204
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,895
- You're pregnant, aren't you?
- What?

1205
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,565
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.

1206
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,567
It's all in your uterus.

1207
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,485
Oh, shit.

1208
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,364
I haven't told them. Do you think
they're gonna be mad?

1209
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,950
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.

1210
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,077
It's okay. We can hide this.

1211
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,789
We'll dress you in black, and
we'll emphasize your boobs.

1212
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,040
Awesome.

1213
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,710
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.

1214
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,087
And then they're gonna
be, like, scary big.

1215
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,799
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.

1216
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,552
Just... Just don't say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.

1217
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:33,431
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.

1218
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,893
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.

1219
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,898
Did you see
this sex offender website?

1220
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,692
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.

1221
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,695
Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.

1222
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,447
Those are sex offenders.

1223
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,866
These people live
in our neighborhood.

1224
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,784
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.

1225
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,245
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?

1226
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,706
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.

1227
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,957
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.

1228
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,208
I don't take it lightly.

1229
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,003
You know, I'm not gonna go over to
any of these people's houses and say,

1230
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,213
"Hey, do you mind... Can you baby-sit?"

1231
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,174
If I didn't care about
these things,

1232
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,800
you wouldn't care about anything.

1233
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,052
Care more.

1234
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,721
You're so concerned with stuff, like
"Don't get them vaccinated."

1235
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,098
"Don't let them eat fish. There's
mercury in the water."

1236
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,768
Jesus, how much Dateline NBC
can you watch?

1237
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,312
I know we're supposed to be nice
with each other right now,

1238
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,756
but I'm having a really hard time.

1239
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,941
- I'm struggling with it right now.
- What am I doing?

1240
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:29,111
'Cause I want to rip your fucking head
off because you're so fucking stupid!

1241
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,448
- This is scary. These are our children.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1242
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,369
- You fucking dipshit. God! You...
- Mmm-hmm.

1243
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,080
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.

1244
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,331
So I'm the bad guy

1245
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,584
because I'm trying to protect our kids
from child molesters and mercury?

1246
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:46,087
And you're cool 'cause you
don't give a shit.

1247
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,673
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Is that it?

1248
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:51,467
- Pretty much.
- God, you're an asshole.

1249
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,719
Don't do this in front of Ben.

1250
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,972
I don't give a shit about Ben.

1251
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,223
Sorry, Ben.

1252
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,308
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.

1253
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,018
Okay, come on! Let's go.

1254
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,728
Oh, I can't go.

1255
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,648
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.

1256
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,274
It's Saturday.

1257
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,069
I got to go.

1258
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,363
You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?

1259
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,156
That's no fun.

1260
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,618
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.

1261
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,370
I'll get it out of him.

1262
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,579
No.

1263
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,504
Hey.

1264
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,757
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Björn couple is?

1265
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,592
We are that happy.

1266
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,428
Yeah. You look happy.

1267
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,097
Which is awesome, 'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.

1268
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,974
You keep saying that. I know.

1269
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,309
This is it. This is perfect.

1270
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,395
Nice.

1271
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,397
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.

1272
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,232
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?

1273
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,359
No. You need your own crib.

1274
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,112
You know, there's one of these lying
in an alley behind my house.

1275
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,823
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.

1276
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,241
You know what? Let me buy it.

1277
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,118
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.

1278
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,287
- And I would love to get it for you.
- No.

1279
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,621
I'm serious. I want to.

1280
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,665
No. It's too much.

1281
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,960
Yes. We'll take it.

1282
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,130
Obviously, I mean, don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.

1283
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,298
Right.

1284
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,176
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can I squeeze out of you?

1285
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,094
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.

1286
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,765
So hot in the Valley.

1287
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:24,018
Hey! Oh, Allison! Hi.

1288
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,686
How are you?

1289
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,272
It's so good to see you.

1290
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,436
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.

1291
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,526
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.

1292
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,111
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

1293
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,654
Oh, it's fine. Hi, I'm Ashley.

1294
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,906
- This is my friend, Ben.
- I'm Ben.

1295
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,324
I went to school with Allison.

1296
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,284
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?

1297
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,787
No. Allison is.

1298
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,623
What? I just saw you a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?

1299
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,708
It was a big surprise.

1300
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,919
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.

1301
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,504
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.

1302
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,172
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.

1303
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,008
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.

1304
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,974
- You know they say don't drink and drive?
- Uh-huh.

1305
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,387
- Don't drink and bone!
- Wow.

1306
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,555
Okay.

1307
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,683
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,

1308
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,408
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,

1309
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,518
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.

1310
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,023
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.

1311
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,317
That's what I did. I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.

1312
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,944
You think she's, like,
hiding me?

1313
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,404
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?

1314
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,573
Probably. I'd hide you.

1315
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,408
How much do wedding rings cost?

1316
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,952
I mean, it really depends,
you know?

1317
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,080
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.

1318
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,207
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.

1319
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,793
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.

1320
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,711
God, it's not porn, okay?

1321
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,674
All we do is we show you what nude
scenes are in what movies.

1322
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,175
Oh, like Mr. Skin?

1323
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,510
Who's Mr. Skin?

1324
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,387
Dude, Mr. Skin.

1325
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,556
Mr. Skin?

1326
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,183
No!

1327
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,519
We've wasted 14 months of our lives.

1328
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,147
This is exactly the same as our site.

1329
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,481
How the fuck did this happen?

1330
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,817
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!

1331
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,068
Fuck me in the beard.

1332
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,362
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!

1333
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,822
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?

1334
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,323
Don't put this on me!

1335
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,491
God damn it!

1336
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,704
Well, shit, I saw it online at one point,
but I guess I didn't connect the dots.

1337
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,955
What are we gonna do now?

1338
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,124
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea

1339
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,917
that no one else has thought of already.

1340
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,753
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.

1341
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,173
Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.

1342
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,556
You know what?

1343
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,642
I think just because
this site exists

1344
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,061
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.

1345
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,563
Good things come in pairs, man, you know.

1346
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,981
Oh, for sure.

1347
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,735
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?

1348
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,486
Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.

1349
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,156
Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

1350
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,908
Exactly. We can work together.

1351
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,160
This can help us,
if anything, I think.

1352
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,578
We're fine. We're golden.

1353
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:53,167
Look, Allison, I'm sure this isn't how
you pictured it being, exactly,

1354
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,502
and it's not how I wanted it to be,

1355
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,631
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.

1356
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,549
It's a promise, Allison.

1357
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,302
It's a promise
that one day I will...

1358
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,806
I will fill this box with a ring that
you deserve, a beautiful ring.

1359
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,475
And I can't afford it yet.

1360
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,938
I've picked it out already, though, and
it's at De Beers, and it's really nice.

1361
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:18,442
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?

1362
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,153
Because I'm in love with you.

1363
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,949
I love you, too.

1364
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,492
Really?

1365
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,827
Oh, man, that's so nice to hear.

1366
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:32,748
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...

1367
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,960
But here's the thing.

1368
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,461
There's a thing?

1369
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:41,507
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.

1370
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:45,678
Just 'cause it's so new, and it's so
exciting that it's great.

1371
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,723
I don't know. We've only known each
other 17 weeks, so it's...

1372
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,225
Okay.

1373
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,270
Honestly, I mean, I thought...

1374
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,939
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby

1375
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,565
and we're not
engaged or anything.

1376
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,942
- I'm gonna get off my knee.
- Yeah.

1377
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,527
It's hurting a little bit.

1378
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,903
No, I'm okay with that.

1379
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,656
You know, we're just doing
what we can.

1380
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,825
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us

1381
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,286
to put any more pressure on ourselves
than we already have.

1382
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,954
Okay. Yeah. That makes perfect sense.

1383
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,580
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

1384
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:16,583
No, no, no. Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?

1385
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,545
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?

1386
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,879
Okay.

1387
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,257
I really do love you.

1388
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,925
I know. Thanks.

1389
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,344
You mentioned that. It's nice.

1390
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,145
Ben proposed to me.

1391
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,689
- What?
- He did.

1392
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,151
It was really sweet. I kind of feel
a little bit bad about it.

1393
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,570
He was, like, wearing
this great little button-down.

1394
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,324
He tucked his shirt in. He got down
on one knee. It was so sweet.

1395
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,160
He didn't have an actual ring, though.
It was just an empty box.

1396
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,246
But, you know, he had this whole spiel
about when he has the money,

1397
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,499
he's gonna buy me the ring that
I deserve and...

1398
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,460
The box was just empty?

1399
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,712
I mean, he can't afford a ring, so...

1400
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,923
So he got down on one knee
and gave you an empty box?

1401
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,383
Yes.

1402
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:07,968
I'm sorry.

1403
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,054
Get over it. It was sweet.

1404
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,778
I'm telling you, if you'd been there,
you would have probably cried.

1405
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,725
- You need to train him.
- Huh?

1406
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:18,937
Oprah said that when two people meet,

1407
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:23,067
they are forced to point out each
other's differences and flaws.

1408
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:26,511
I thought you were supposed to just accept
people for who they are, love them anyway.

1409
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,322
You criticize them a lot,

1410
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,617
and then they get so down on themselves
that they're forced to change.

1411
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,285
Really? You don't think
that would just make it worse?

1412
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,495
That'd be, like, naggy.

1413
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,997
And then in the end,
they thank you for it.

1414
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,459
You can't commit to him. You can't
make a commitment to him.

1415
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,421
You don't even know him. I don't even
know Pete after 10 years.

1416
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,715
- What?
- I don't know what he's up to.

1417
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,175
He's miserable.

1418
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,510
Why do you say that?

1419
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,845
- I think he's cheating on me.
- What?

1420
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,641
He's always going off to these business
meetings at odd hours.

1421
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,393
And then I try to call him
on his cell phone,

1422
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,729
and he says that he's in bad
cell phone reception areas

1423
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,190
when he's in good
cell phone reception areas.

1424
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,817
Maybe he's working late.

1425
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,860
You know, I mean, maybe
he's just working really hard

1426
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,821
to sign a new great band
or something.

1427
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,656
I can't imagine Pete doing
something like that.

1428
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:15,202
There's no part of you that thinks that
maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

1429
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,162
No. Mmm-mmm.

1430
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,664
I think he might be.

1431
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,875
"Memory Spy, web memory software."

1432
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,461
"Locate history files, websites visited,"

1433
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:28,715
"hidden downloads, searches,
email history. Memory Spy."

1434
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,137
Let's see you hide
from me now, little man.

1435
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,480
So you're not even
gonna tell them?

1436
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,941
No. You know, I don't have to tell them.

1437
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,986
It's illegal for them
to fire me over it anyway,

1438
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,905
and I get three months
maternity leave if I stay,

1439
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,283
so I'm just, you know,
not gonna tell them.

1440
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,076
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah. I like it.

1441
01:05:56,161 --> 01:06:00,497
It is a good plan until her water breaks
all over Robert De Niro's shoes.

1442
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,876
"My shoes! Hey, there's all this
baby goo on it."

1443
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,754
"These shoes? On these shoes?"

1444
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,131
"Did you puke on my shoes?"

1445
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,842
"Did your water break on my shoes?"
"Did you puke on my shoes?"

1446
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,260
Oh, my God.

1447
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,054
Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid
and all your dreams and hopes

1448
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,557
just go right out the window?

1449
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,768
What changed for you? What went
out the window? What plans?

1450
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,729
You do everything
exactly the same.

1451
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,653
No, I mean, I love what
I'm doing. Like, say...

1452
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:29,276
Okay, say, you know, before you're married
and have children,

1453
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,361
you wanna go live
in India for a year.

1454
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,239
You can do it. But you can't do it
once you have a family.

1455
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,533
- You wanna go live in India?
- I don't wanna go live in India.

1456
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,953
Do you want to go to India? Go to India!
Seriously, go to India.

1457
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,538
What about you? Do you want
to go to India?

1458
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,707
I'm not going to India.
You can go to India.

1459
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,209
I get what he's talking about.

1460
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,212
You know, honestly, like,
when I found out about...

1461
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:54,468
I totally, like, I just had this flash
of me, like in a white Ford Bronco,

1462
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,513
and I'm just hauling ass
for Canada, man.

1463
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,015
The chopper's taping
the whole thing, and I just...

1464
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,226
I bust through the border
and I'm a free man!

1465
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,061
That's all I kept thinking, man.

1466
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,562
You know what I'm saying?
It was a flash!

1467
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,523
- Wait. What do you mean? What are you...
- Don't look at me.

1468
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,889
- We can talk about our fears here.
- It's not like he did it.

1469
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,141
I mean, honestly, like, if Doc Brown screeched
up in front of you in the DeLorean.

1470
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,239
Open the door, he's like,

1471
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,784
"Hey, Allison, come on. I got the car
here. What do you wanna do?"

1472
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,578
No part of your brain would have been,
like, "You know, maybe we'll go back"

1473
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:25,165
"to that night and I would maybe
put a condom on Ben's dick."

1474
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,085
- You never got that flash?
- No.

1475
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,295
And I don't know what you're
talking about.

1476
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,715
"Where we're going,
we don't need roads."

1477
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,259
Exactly. You wouldn't do that?

1478
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,095
I don't know who Doc Brown is.

1479
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,263
What are you talking about?

1480
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,473
Doc Brown is the guy who's
Christopher Lloyd.

1481
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,016
He invented the DeLorean,
the time machine.

1482
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,351
- He's the one who made the time machine.
- What?

1483
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,396
It's the time machine. Everyone has
the time machine image.

1484
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,649
Hey. I have a really good idea.

1485
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,611
Why don't the two of you
get into your time machine,

1486
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,656
go back in time and fuck each other?

1487
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,116
Who needs a time machine?

1488
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,701
This is my time machine!

1489
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,954
I'm gonna throw you in my
DeLorean, gun it to '88.

1490
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,418
You are a funny motherfucker,
man. Jesus.

1491
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,046
How can you fight with him? Look at
his face. I just want to kiss it.

1492
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,798
I think he's cute.

1493
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,883
I like the way you move.

1494
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,555
This is fun! We should
do this more, I think.

1495
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,279
I mean, this is, like, the most fun
I've had in a really long time.

1496
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,401
- Come on, harder.
- I can't do it harder.

1497
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,404
Why? Come on. Come on,
just do it. Deeper.

1498
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,031
- I can't.
- Oh, why?

1499
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,200
- I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
- Oh, come on! Just do it!

1500
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,536
Please, don't yell at me,
please don't.

1501
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,497
What? The doctor and Debbie
said it's fine. Come on!

1502
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,708
Look, can we... I'm sorry,
can we change positions?

1503
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,169
- What?
- I'm gonna crush the baby. I know it.

1504
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,295
- This is ridiculous! Why are we...
- No, it's not.

1505
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,881
There's no shell in there,
you know?

1506
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,175
Millions of people have sex
when they're pregnant!

1507
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,594
I don't know how it works.
It just works, okay? Just do it.

1508
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,305
All I'm thinking of is that I'm gonna...
I weigh over 200 pounds.

1509
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,642
- Just get over it!
- I can't do it. Can you just get on top?

1510
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:10,187
All I see is our baby getting poked
in the face by my penis.

1511
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,813
- Trust me, you're not even close.
- Okay.

1512
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,815
- Come on, fine.
- Okay, fine.

1513
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,111
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1514
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:20,322
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

1515
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,366
Okay. Oh, good.

1516
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,701
I can't. I can't.

1517
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,871
I can't. I can't do this, I just... I
can't. I can't. I can't focus like this.

1518
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,957
I look disgusting from this angle. I can
feel you looking up at my chins.

1519
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,922
- I know I look gross.
- No, you look beautiful.

1520
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,169
Your chin looks so skinny.

1521
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,505
And my boobs are all, like, squishy,
and they're flopping around.

1522
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,799
- I can feel it, and it's distracting.
- No...

1523
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,342
it's all National Geographic.

1524
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,220
Okay. Can we do... Do you
wanna do doggie style?

1525
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,515
No. I do not want you
to fuck me like a dog.

1526
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,643
I'm not fucking you
like a dog. It's doggie style.

1527
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,604
It's just the style.
It's not...

1528
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,817
It's not like a dog. We don't have
to go outside or anything.

1529
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,363
- Here we go.
- Okay. Okay.

1530
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:02,656
- Okay, is it good?
- Yeah.

1531
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,582
- Should I go slower?
- Yeah, no, that's good.

1532
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:05,951
- Okay, faster?
- Harder.

1533
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,536
- Just tell me when you're close.
- Just go harder.

1534
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:10,163
- Okay.
- Keep going!

1535
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,957
Oh, God.

1536
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,500
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

1537
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,793
- What happened?
- Oh, my God.

1538
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,254
- The baby, it kicked my hand.
- Well, no, no, it always kicks.

1539
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,018
- No, no, no. Not like this.
- No, it's fine. It's fine. Just keep going.

1540
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,550
It was a warning kick.
This was a bad kick.

1541
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,552
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine! It's fine!

1542
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,054
Look, my dick must be like
an inch away from its face,

1543
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,014
- and it's coming, just coming in at its face.
- Oh, shit.

1544
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,821
What if it kicked 'cause it didn't like it?

1545
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:33,311
I can't do that to our baby.
That's the first thing it's gonna see.

1546
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,938
What are you talking about?

1547
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,149
It's having the baby between,

1548
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,526
you know, us, it just makes it
weird. I'm sorry.

1549
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,319
It just freaks me out a bit.
It's a little weird.

1550
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,612
I have totally lost it.

1551
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:44,781
- You've totally lost it?
- I've lost it.

1552
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,032
Okay.

1553
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,451
Great, you know what?
Just forget it.

1554
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,036
Okay. Okay, fine.

1555
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,332
Don't worry. I won't
make you do this again.

1556
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,709
Shit.

1557
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,893
Fuck me!

1558
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,020
Oh, my God. It's the Russians!

1559
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,941
- Jodi, I'll protect you!
- Oh, man!

1560
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,276
Ben!

1561
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,029
Oh, my God.

1562
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,740
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1563
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,242
Oh, God, that was horrible!
That was so horrible!

1564
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,869
When will it be light out?

1565
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,621
Okay, you're fine, man. Take it easy.

1566
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,825
- Hey, did anybody turn off the gas?
- I didn't do it.

1567
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,249
Oh, motherfucker.

1568
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,210
- Hey, Marty.
- Yeah.

1569
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,670
This is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty
incredible person.

1570
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,798
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1571
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:46,259
Whoa, dude! Not cool, Martin.

1572
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:48,303
That's... That wasn't...

1573
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,888
Hey, are you serious,
Howard Hughes?

1574
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,599
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

1575
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,935
- Come on.
- Where were you?

1576
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,687
Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
I'm sorry, okay?

1577
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,690
Yeah, 'cause you're getting
high off your huge bong.

1578
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:01,900
How am I supposed
to be comfortable

1579
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,860
with the idea that you can
take care of me and the baby

1580
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,154
if you are always getting high?

1581
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,572
You want me to stop smoking pot

1582
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,699
'cause there's an earthquake
once every 10 years?

1583
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,286
That makes no sense, Allison.
Look, you're being irrational.

1584
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,652
Just relax, okay? We're all scared,
you know? You just...

1585
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,250
Oh, shit, the cops.

1586
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,170
California, eh?

1587
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:45,485
You know, it's times like this
I'm glad I don't own nice things.

1588
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,051
It's a big mess, but there's only like
$50 worth of shit here.

1589
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,073
And that's kind of the good thing.

1590
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,409
You know, my dad told me,
"Don't move to Northridge."

1591
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,620
But you figure, like, what are the chances
of that happening twice, you know?

1592
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:56,913
What is this?

1593
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,373
It's a ninja weapon.

1594
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:04,004
I hope this place doesn't get condemned.
That would suck.

1595
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,878
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1596
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,923
<i>- You!</i>
- Hi. So, listen.

1597
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,754
Will you do me a big favor?

1598
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,509
Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight.

1599
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,303
She thinks Pete is cheating on her.

1600
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,138
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah.

1601
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,890
<i>Well, she saw one of his emails and...</i>

1602
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,975
- Oh, man.
<i>- There's an address.</i>

1603
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,860
That sounds terrible.
I don't want to do that.

1604
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,479
Ben, come on.

1605
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,813
He's not cheating on her.

1606
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,607
- How do you know?
<i>- I just know.</i>

1607
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:08,068
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- I'm 100 % sure he's not cheating.

1608
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:09,611
<i>Are you really?</i>

1609
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,279
No.

1610
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,031
It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat.

1611
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,199
Why?

1612
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,785
'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass
and Pete's awesome.

1613
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:21,122
Why don't you just come over then, and
we'll just diffuse the situation a little.

1614
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,500
I'm just saying the music industry
is different now.

1615
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,586
You can't... Steely Dan would never
even have a chance.

1616
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,547
Well, maybe it's 'cause Steely
Dan gargles my balls.

1617
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,424
- They're incredible.
- They really aren't good, man.

1618
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,676
Old Steely Dan.

1619
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,094
If I ever listen to Steely Dan,

1620
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,554
I want you to slice my head
off with an Al Jarreau LP.

1621
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:40,850
Oh, I should get going.

1622
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,520
I'm supposed to see this
band tonight in Hollywood.

1623
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,284
Actually, they're playing
in Laurel Canyon,

1624
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,358
so I'll call you 'cause the reception's
terrible over there, so...

1625
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:49,526
Okay.

1626
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,278
And I don't want you to worry
'cause I know you worry.

1627
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,683
I'm just gonna jump
in the shower.

1628
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,616
It would be terrible if I smelled
worse than the band.

1629
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,119
Okay. Have fun.

1630
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,537
All right.

1631
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:06,251
You guys are crazy. He's acting totally
normal and hilarious.

1632
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,224
She doesn't have a gun,
does she?

1633
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,309
No. I don't think so.

1634
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,117
Looks like no one's home.

1635
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,369
Why was the door unlocked?

1636
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,829
Wait here.

1637
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,136
I kind of feel bad for Pete.

1638
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,471
What?

1639
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,765
This isn't a good way, you know.

1640
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:05,101
If you're gonna get caught cheating,
it shouldn't be like this.

1641
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:08,855
Well, maybe he should've thought of
that before he was cheating.

1642
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,523
- Pete!
- Stop it.

1643
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,276
I coughed. What do you want from me?

1644
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,653
There's nobody up there.

1645
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,905
Thank you.

1646
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,240
I guess I was wrong.

1647
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,366
I told you.

1648
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,702
- Can we get out of here, please?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.

1649
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,871
- Suck it!
- Did you hear that?

1650
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,332
- What?
- I didn't hear anything.

1651
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,892
Carlos Delgado. Excellent choice.

1652
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,311
Too bad I got him three rounds ago.
You're still on the clock.

1653
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,146
- Oh, shit!
- You gotta do something.

1654
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:51,981
We need a name.

1655
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,316
Hideki Matsui.

1656
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,735
- You just took my whole outfield.
- Sorry, Charlie.

1657
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,403
What is this?

1658
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,822
Debbie.

1659
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,074
What the fuck is this?

1660
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,951
It's our fantasy baseball draft.

1661
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,452
We said no wives.

1662
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,912
Your fantasy what?

1663
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,749
It's our draft for fantasy baseball.

1664
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:12,085
I told you all about this.

1665
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,586
Got Matsui.

1666
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,674
Shit!

1667
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,469
Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out!

1668
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,763
- Come on, who's going?
- Prince, you're on the clock.

1669
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,807
I should have told you.

1670
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,434
- What else have you been lying about?
- Nothing...

1671
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,602
That guy said,

1672
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,480
"Don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out."

1673
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,190
Yeah, I heard him.

1674
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,859
That was hilarious.

1675
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,743
It's just that I know you've been mad
'cause I've been working so much,

1676
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,280
and I didn't want to upset you.

1677
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,699
I wouldn't be mad. I don't get mad.

1678
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,119
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.

1679
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,037
No, this is worse.

1680
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,622
How is this worse?

1681
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:54,210
This is you wanting to be with your friends
more than your family.

1682
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,630
Look, the reason I make that up is because
if I told you what I was really doing,

1683
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,299
you would just get mad.

1684
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:04,304
So you think I'm seeing a band, I do my
fantasy draft, and it's win-win.

1685
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,975
Well, what'd you do last Wednesday night
when you said you went to see a band?

1686
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,310
I went to the movies.

1687
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,478
- With who?
- By myself.

1688
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,189
What'd you see?

1689
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,690
Spider-Man 3.

1690
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,401
Why do you want to go by yourself?
Why didn't you ask me to go?

1691
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,045
Because I needed to get away, you know.

1692
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:23,239
With work and you and the kids, sometimes
I just need some time to myself.

1693
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:26,409
I need time for myself.
I want time for myself, too.

1694
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,411
You're not the only one.

1695
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,496
It's not that big of a deal.

1696
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,167
I like Spider-Man.

1697
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,502
Okay, so let's see
Spider-Man 3 next week.

1698
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,088
I don't wanna go see it now.

1699
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,091
I don't wanna have
to ask you to ask me.

1700
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:45,345
I want you to just come up
with it on your own.

1701
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,097
I don't even know what to say.
What do you want me to do?

1702
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:53,436
You just think because you don't yell
that you're not mean, but this is mean.

1703
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,314
I'm not being mean.
I'm being honest.

1704
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,774
You're telling me
I need to be honest.

1705
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,776
No, you're not. You're lying.

1706
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,738
I'm doing it because I need to
keep my sanity a little bit.

1707
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,993
You know what? I don't want you
at the house anymore, okay?

1708
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,621
Come on.

1709
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,124
Shit, she's coming back.

1710
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,670
How come we go to
the gynecologist so often?

1711
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,924
I bet we have to go so much so we can
pay for that $300,000 machine he has.

1712
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:28,388
I cannot stop thinking
about what an asshole Pete is.

1713
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,767
That's a little strong, I would say.

1714
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:33,935
Really?

1715
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:38,064
'Cause that had to be one of the most
selfish things I've ever witnessed.

1716
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,748
It's understandable, I would say.
I even think it's kind of funny.

1717
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,528
What's funny about it?

1718
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,947
Well, you won't laugh now,
I wouldn't imagine,

1719
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,117
but, you know, the situation.

1720
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,411
We break into this stranger's house

1721
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,664
thinking we're gonna find him
sleeping with a woman,

1722
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,375
and it's a bunch of nerds
playing fantasy baseball.

1723
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,836
If you saw that, like,
on television, you would laugh.

1724
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,047
Is that what you think?
Is that what you wanna do, Ben?

1725
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,550
I don't even like baseball.

1726
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:09,304
I'm just saying, when you're a guy and,
you know, you have a family,

1727
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,889
you have responsibility,
you lose that male camaraderie.

1728
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,601
And I get that. I totally understand
where he's coming from.

1729
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,103
Why do guys always go
to that place?

1730
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:19,272
"We miss male camaraderie."
Why do I give a shit?

1731
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,358
Go hang out with your bearded
freak friends. I don't care.

1732
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,643
You wanna hang out with guys that look
like the shoe bomber, it's all on you, man.

1733
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,238
What the fuck am I supposed to say to that?

1734
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,406
You should just support me!

1735
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,908
You know, you should just
support everything I say

1736
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,536
because at this juncture in my life,
I'm allowed to be wrong!

1737
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,246
- So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
- Yes!

1738
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,332
I can't tell you that you're
acting like a lunatic?

1739
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,791
- No.
- No? Okay.

1740
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,002
That's helpful. You have to do nothing!

1741
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,212
I've sacrificed a lot of shit to do this!

1742
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,922
- You haven't sacrificed anything!
- I have.

1743
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:49,385
I've had to sacrifice my job,
my body, my youth, my vagina!

1744
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,720
You've sacrificed your vagina?

1745
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,639
Yes! It will never look
the same after this!

1746
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:59,812
Well. Fine. I'm sorry, I'll pay for vaginal
reconstructive surgery.

1747
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,273
You can't pay for shit!
You can barely buy spaghetti!

1748
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,734
You're right! Fine! Okay.

1749
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,986
You know what? Get out of the car.

1750
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,821
You know what? How...

1751
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,156
Why don't you not threaten me?

1752
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,241
You should just get out
of the fucking car.

1753
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,535
I'm not gonna get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere! No!

1754
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,661
- Get out of the car!
- No.

1755
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,206
- I own this car! Get out of my car!
- No.

1756
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,415
- Get out of my car!
- No.

1757
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,626
Get out of my fucking car!

1758
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,807
Can you let me back
in the car, please?

1759
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,893
Have you calmed down?
Did you take a breath?

1760
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,564
I have no clue where we are!

1761
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,234
Fine. Go.

1762
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:52,657
Great.

1763
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,051
Okay.

1764
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:16,931
Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or
my belt buckle, my belt buckle's huge.

1765
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,391
Don't worry about gaining weight.

1766
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,477
Your baby wants you to gain
a whole mess of weight.

1767
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:22,770
Are you fucking kidding me?

1768
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,273
Why don't you take off your earrings, too?
They weigh about 80 pounds.

1769
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,441
They're made out of moon rocks,
aren't they?

1770
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,318
Do not make fun of me.
Okay? I am hormonal.

1771
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,654
I am terrified, and I am falling apart,

1772
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,073
so stop treating everything
like it's a big joke!

1773
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,558
Okay, I'm sorry
you're freaking out,

1774
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,911
but I just walked three fucking miles
through Koreatown to get here!

1775
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,916
Sorry if I'm trying to lighten
the mood a little.

1776
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,123
Well, don't, okay?

1777
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,125
You can't take anything seriously!

1778
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,009
You know, you didn't even
read the baby books.

1779
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,921
I didn't read the baby book!
What's gonna happen?

1780
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,841
How did anyone ever give birth
without a baby book?

1781
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,011
That's right. The ancient
Egyptians fucking engraved

1782
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,555
What to Expect When You're Expecting
on the pyramid walls!

1783
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,056
I forgot about that!

1784
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,893
Who gives a flying fuck
about the baby books?

1785
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,353
It just shows your lack
of commitment, Ben!

1786
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,898
That you're not in this with me!

1787
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,359
Did you just say "my lack of commitment"?
'Cause that's what it sounded like.

1788
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:15,615
It almost seems as though you forgot
I proposed to you, like an asshole!

1789
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,533
And you said no to me!

1790
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,702
If you feel that way,
you should just go.

1791
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,245
Really. Just go.

1792
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,081
Because we didn't mean
to do this together, okay?

1793
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:28,294
And... And we tried to make it work
and that was good, I suppose.

1794
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:29,962
But it doesn't work.

1795
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,381
Because we are two
completely different people.

1796
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:36,052
And I think it would just be easier for
both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.

1797
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,496
You know, I know this isn't you talking,
it's your hormones,

1798
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:41,724
but I would just like to say,
fuck you, hormones!

1799
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:46,395
You are a crazy bitch, hormones.
Not Allison! Hormones!

1800
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,690
Fuck them! It's a girl!
Buy some pink shit!

1801
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,984
Nice. You are such an asshole.

1802
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:55,279
You know what?
Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!

1803
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,491
I will fuck my bong.
Doggie style, for once.

1804
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,413
Are you ready?

1805
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,961
I'm really sorry about all that.
That was really inappropriate.

1806
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,505
Oh, no, that's okay. It happens all
the time here. It's fine.

1807
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,302
Oh, good, okay, I don't
feel so stupid, then.

1808
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:15,327
No, no, not at all.

1809
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,052
I totally know what you're
talking about, man.

1810
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,889
Like, if I wrote out the list of
shit Allison doesn't let me do,

1811
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:26,310
like, it would be endless. "Don't smoke pot.
Don't have samurai swords in your room."

1812
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,854
"Don't have illegal grow
operations in the house."

1813
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:31,065
I mean, like, I could go on all
fucking day.

1814
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:34,735
Have I told her to stop
doing anything ever? No.

1815
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,654
Marriage is like that show,
Everybody Loves Raymond,

1816
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,239
but it's not funny.

1817
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,033
All the problems are the same,
but it's...

1818
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,411
You know, instead of
all the funny, pithy dialog,

1819
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:46,872
everybody's just really
pissed off and tense.

1820
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:51,669
Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version
of Everybody Loves Raymond.

1821
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,213
But it doesn't last 22 minutes.

1822
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,091
It lasts forever.

1823
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:02,263
Let's get out of here, man.
Honestly, like, let's just go.

1824
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,348
- Let's go to Vegas.
- Let's do it.

1825
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,850
- Yeah.
- Why not?

1826
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,024
- Get up.
- What?

1827
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,268
- We're not gonna do this.
- What?

1828
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:15,568
Seriously.

1829
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,030
What are you doing?

1830
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,742
We have to go do something
and have fun!

1831
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,202
I'm just so tired.

1832
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,537
I know you're tired.

1833
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,999
But we're gonna be untired!
We're gonna go live!

1834
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,461
I hate you so much sometimes.

1835
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,879
We're gonna be positive.

1836
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,632
Positive, positive, positive! Up!

1837
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,091
How many Red Bulls have you had?

1838
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:42,094
I've had about three Red Bulls
in the last 15 minutes.

1839
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,721
And I feel fabulous!

1840
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,600
We're gonna create a new life
and it's gonna be awesome!

1841
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:49,727
Get up! Let's go!

1842
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,398
Since when do we lock
this fucking thing? Come on!

1843
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,197
We can't go, dude. Sorry.

1844
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:03,449
Holy crap! What happened?

1845
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,201
We got pink eye.

1846
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,244
What, you giving each other
butterfly kisses or something?

1847
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,529
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
That's not how you get pink eye.

1848
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:13,042
You get it from poo particles making their
way into your ocular cavities.

1849
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,753
- Hey, Ben. How's it going?
- Yo.

1850
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,547
I farted on Jason's pillow
as a practical joke.

1851
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,758
He farted on Jonah's,
thinking it was mine,

1852
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,553
and then eventually
pink-eyed my pillow.

1853
01:26:24,638 --> 01:26:29,392
I'm not proud of any of this, but I think
we've all forgiven each other.

1854
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,686
But we can't go anywhere.

1855
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,063
You can get pink eye
from farting in a pillow?

1856
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,398
- Totally.
- Mmm-hmm.

1857
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:36,816
That's awesome!

1858
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,734
Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

1859
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:40,236
Jesus, Martin got it bad!

1860
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,571
What, did someone take a dump
right in your eye?

1861
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:45,574
No. No pink eye for me.

1862
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,495
I'm just really high.

1863
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:53,666
Well, stay back, guys.
I got to get my suit, okay?

1864
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:56,669
Fuck you.

1865
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,715
Are you Debbie's husband?

1866
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,007
Yeah.

1867
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,638
- This is fun!
- This is great.

1868
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,924
- It's just fun, man.
- We're gonna have the best time ever.

1869
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,184
- We make a good team, man.
- Yeah.

1870
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,311
It's like, I can't come here
with Debbie.

1871
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,439
She wouldn't understand it.
She doesn't understand.

1872
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,233
She wants to hold me in, and she was
telling Allison she could train you.

1873
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:20,609
She thinks she could train me?

1874
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,194
Yeah, like you're running
the Triple Crown.

1875
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,281
She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried
and Roy's Bengal.

1876
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,283
You think I'm trained. I'll...

1877
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,327
- I'll bite your fucking face off!
- That's right.

1878
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,828
In front of a crowd, baby.

1879
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,874
This is better. Besides, I don't know if I
have enough of these babies to go around.

1880
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,375
My God! Are these mushrooms?

1881
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,960
Uh-huh. I got them from
a roadie for the Black Crowes.

1882
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,128
I'm eating them.

1883
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,881
No, no, no. Save it! I got tickets
to Cirque Du Soleil.

1884
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,716
You do? No, you don't.

1885
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,092
I swear to God, man.

1886
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,136
Holy shit!

1887
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,846
See? I see the beam of light.

1888
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,223
There it is, baby! Whoo-hoo!

1889
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,893
You're so money that you don't even know
how much money you have.

1890
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,812
You're money, baby!
You're money!

1891
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,402
I love Vegas, man.

1892
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,237
This is the greatest place
on Earth.

1893
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:08,407
- It's really amazing here.
- You got my tie!

1894
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,202
This is awesome!

1895
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,081
Now, that's how you get pink eye.

1896
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,633
Hey, what's up? Baby girl.

1897
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,009
Hi.

1898
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,261
- What's up?
- End of the line, please.

1899
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,555
- Really?
- Yeah.

1900
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,558
Oh, come on.

1901
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,936
Look, we're at capacity, okay?

1902
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,854
We'll let some people in
when it clears out a little.

1903
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:42,233
You'll get right in if you go
back to the end of the line.

1904
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,235
We come here all the time.
It's not a big deal.

1905
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,153
It doesn't really look
that crowded in there.

1906
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,155
Hey, look. I don't make the rules.

1907
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:49,365
Please?

1908
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,033
No.

1909
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:54,912
Hey, what's up, shorty?
What's up, pretty girls?

1910
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,874
See y'all when y'all get out.

1911
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,626
Watch yourself.

1912
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,378
What was that?

1913
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,672
- What the fuck was that?
- It is what it is, sweetie.

1914
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:05,840
Now can you step
to the back, please?

1915
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:07,550
- You don't need to call me sweetie.
- Maybe we should just go.

1916
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:08,759
Maybe you should listen to your friend.

1917
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:09,927
No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

1918
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,179
All right, you want to come in,
you're gonna have to go

1919
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,515
to the end of the line and wait
like everybody else.

1920
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,183
I'm not gonna go to the end
of the fucking line.

1921
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,434
Who the fuck are you?

1922
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:20,396
I have just as much of
a right to be here

1923
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,106
as any of these little skanky girls!

1924
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,983
What, am I not skanky enough for you?

1925
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,776
You want me to hike up
my fucking skirt?

1926
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,154
What the fuck is your problem?
I'm not going anywhere!

1927
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,199
You're just some roided out
freak with a fucking clipboard!

1928
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,202
And your stupid little fucking
rope! You know what?

1929
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,997
You may have power now,
but you're not God!

1930
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:40,082
You're a doorman! Okay?

1931
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:45,629
You're a doorman, doorman,
doorman, doorman, doorman!

1932
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,425
So, fuck you, you fucking fag

1933
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,552
with your fucking little
faggy gloves.

1934
01:29:58,685 --> 01:29:59,977
I know.

1935
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,523
You're right. I'm so sorry.

1936
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,568
I fucking hate this job.

1937
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:11,238
I don't want to be the one to pass
judgment and decide who gets in.

1938
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,324
This shit makes me sick
to my stomach.

1939
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,951
I get the runs from the stress.

1940
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:19,288
It's not 'cause you're not hot.
I would love to tap that ass.

1941
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:22,666
I would tear that ass up.

1942
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:26,629
I can't let you in 'cause you're old
as fuck, for this club,

1943
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,381
not, you know, for the Earth.

1944
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:30,507
What?

1945
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,343
You old. She pregnant.

1946
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,387
Can't have a bunch of old,
pregnant bitches running around.

1947
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:36,931
That's crazy.

1948
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:41,769
I'm only allowed to let in 5% black
people. He said that. 5%.

1949
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,771
That mean if there's
25 people here,

1950
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,565
I get to let in one-and-a-quarter
black people.

1951
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,109
So I got to hope there's a black
midget in the crowd.

1952
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,445
Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

1953
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,030
Why y'all wanna be in here anyway?

1954
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,990
Y'all need to be at a yoga
class or something.

1955
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:57,034
What the fuck is she doing at the club?

1956
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,453
That's not even good parenting
right there.

1957
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:02,122
Your old ass should know better than that.

1958
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,582
Oh, God.

1959
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:10,547
Have the mushrooms
kicked in yet?

1960
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:38,283
This was a great idea, man.

1961
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:41,620
This is the best idea
I've ever had in my life.

1962
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,918
What are they gonna do?

1963
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:54,258
What in the world
are they doing?

1964
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:58,178
If I shaved my stomach and my chest,
I would look exactly like that.

1965
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:01,724
Those guys are at work right now.

1966
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,894
"What'd you do today?"
"I just lifted my brother."

1967
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,357
No. Don't applaud. He'll fall.

1968
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,905
I'm freaking out right now, man.

1969
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,324
The mushrooms are turning on me.

1970
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,665
Papa.

1971
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,542
I'm not your papa!

1972
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,836
Papa!

1973
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,424
I can't deal with this shit, man!

1974
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,387
Hold up. Hold up. Ben, wait.
Ben, Ben, Ben, wait!

1975
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,019
It's over.

1976
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,270
What's over?

1977
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:49,605
My youth.

1978
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,440
Oh, don't say that.

1979
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:52,983
It's true.

1980
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:58,030
- I just wanna dance. I love dancing.
- So dance.

1981
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,407
I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

1982
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,451
I should be embarrassed.

1983
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:07,206
I'm a fucking whale, and I'm trying to get
into some stupid club and...

1984
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,124
No, you look beautiful.

1985
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,251
And you're young and you're tall,

1986
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:15,005
and you got the good lips and boobs,
and you're young still.

1987
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,591
I'm gonna be alone.

1988
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:18,759
Debbie, no, you're not.

1989
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,344
Yes, I am.

1990
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:24,515
Oh, God!

1991
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,726
Fucking men!

1992
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:33,148
I get worse-looking and he
gets better-looking,

1993
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,567
and it's so fucking unfair.

1994
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,362
Oh, fuck.

1995
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,614
We should go.

1996
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:46,120
My babysitter always gets mad
when we come home past 12:00.

1997
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:51,208
She's such a pissy little high-school cunt.

1998
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,754
<i>Let's move, gang! Come on,
come on, come on!</i>

1999
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,005
<i>Jessica, can you get these plates</i>

2000
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:58,841
<i>- and put them on the table, please?</i>
- This isn't funny.

2001
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,801
That guy has 12 kids. It's not funny.
It's...

2002
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,245
<i>Now I get to start all over again!</i>

2003
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:04,721
This is sick. This is a sick movie.

2004
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:08,892
That's a lot of responsibility to be
joking about. That's not funny.

2005
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:11,145
I got to turn this off.
It's freaking me out.

2006
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,772
There are five different types
of chairs in this hotel room.

2007
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,578
Holy fuck. What are they
all doing in here?

2008
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:17,317
These are five different types of chairs.

2009
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:20,404
Get them out of here, man. This is
too many chairs for one room.

2010
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:23,368
There's a guy that works for this hotel.
His whole job is to find chairs.

2011
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,908
Look at this one. Look at it.

2012
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,702
It's gold and red, and it's kind of shiny.

2013
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,370
Shiny thread? Unbelievable.

2014
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,165
It is beautiful and it feels amazing.

2015
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,626
The tall one's gawking at me and
the short one's being very droll.

2016
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,752
I don't like them.

2017
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,045
Oh, wow.

2018
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,465
It's weird that chairs even exist
when you're not sitting on them.

2019
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,594
I'm up high!
I'm really high up.

2020
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:46,013
I should've read the baby books.

2021
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,890
Why didn't you read
the baby books?

2022
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:49,725
'Cause then it's real, you know?

2023
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:51,849
Dude, it's real whether or not
you read those books.

2024
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,354
That baby's coming.

2025
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:56,398
Oh, man!

2026
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:58,150
Think they'll take us back?

2027
01:34:58,234 --> 01:34:59,484
Yes.

2028
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:03,238
But I don't know why.

2029
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,782
Do you ever wonder how somebody
could even like you?

2030
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,952
All the time, man. Like every day.
I wonder how you like me.

2031
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:12,998
How can Debbie like me? She likes me.
I mean, she loves me.

2032
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:16,126
The biggest problem in our marriage is that
she wants me around.

2033
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,294
She loves me so much

2034
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,755
that she wants me around all the time.

2035
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,841
That's our biggest problem.
And I can't even accept that?

2036
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,384
Like that upsets me?

2037
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:25,636
What?

2038
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,262
She's the one. She loves me.

2039
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,474
You can't believe people love you?

2040
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,769
I love you, man! Debbie loves you!

2041
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,479
I don't think I can accept her love.

2042
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,843
There's something wrong with me.

2043
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,067
You can't accept love?

2044
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,318
I don't know what it is.

2045
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:44,196
Love? The most beautiful, shiny,
warmy thing in the world?

2046
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,405
You can't accept it?

2047
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,199
I have to go to this other chair.

2048
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,827
Oh, this is a better energy.

2049
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:54,122
You can't accept pure love?
You can't accept Debbie?

2050
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,416
She's chosen to give you her life.

2051
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,378
She's picked you as her life partner!

2052
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:02,172
But you play fantasy baseball because
you can't accept her love?

2053
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,510
I could accept it, man.

2054
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,221
And Debbie's amazing, man.

2055
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:12,641
She's cool and she's funny
and she smells good

2056
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:15,769
and she's nice and her hair
always looks different.

2057
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,229
She's too good for you, man.

2058
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:19,398
Tastes like a rainbow.

2059
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:22,150
You're disgusting. You know,
you're an urchin.

2060
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:24,653
And she busts your balls
'cause you're a little bitch.

2061
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:28,115
You're a filthy bitch!
And I'd bust your balls.

2062
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:33,412
Debbie wants to give her life to you, and
Allison doesn't want to do that with me.

2063
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,747
And it makes me sad all day.

2064
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:39,001
I want to go home.

2065
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,752
I wanna go home, too.

2066
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:45,924
- Everything looks beautiful.
- Thanks.

2067
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,509
I went kind of overboard, huh?

2068
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:48,844
No. It's great.

2069
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,763
Your daughter only turns eight once.

2070
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,974
Is Ben gonna come?

2071
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,768
I don't think so. I don't know
why he would.

2072
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,784
Oh, hey. What up, dawg?

2073
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,036
Where have you been?

2074
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,704
Around. You know?

2075
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,539
Just kind of doing my thing.

2076
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,499
Why is everybody so mad at you?

2077
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,418
I don't know. Are they mad?
What have they been saying?

2078
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:25,839
They've been saying, like, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, "Ben's a prick."

2079
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:26,923
They said that?

2080
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,508
A lot.

2081
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:29,801
That sucks.

2082
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,595
What does it mean?

2083
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,389
Penis. It means penis.

2084
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,640
Oh.

2085
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,602
Penis.

2086
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:42,981
Babe, we're running low on plates.

2087
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:44,399
Hey, Ben! What's up, man?

2088
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:45,901
What's happening, man?

2089
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,903
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Debbie.

2090
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,488
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2091
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:50,781
Hi.

2092
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:54,159
Did you just get pink cupcakes
or yellow cupcakes?

2093
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:55,619
I just got yellow cupcakes.

2094
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,204
I thought I said get pink cupcakes.

2095
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,831
- I can run out. I'll get some more.
- Nah, it's no big deal.

2096
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,333
- I don't mind.
- No, it doesn't matter.

2097
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,168
- You sure?
- Yeah. You look really cute in that.

2098
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,669
All right.

2099
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:09,591
- Well, that was fast, you pussy.
- I'm a...

2100
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:15,430
You're the one that got dressed up like
a cholo on Easter to come to this party.

2101
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:18,016
How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?

2102
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:22,437
You look like Babe Ruth's
gay brother, Gabe Ruth.

2103
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:25,774
Well played, sir. That was good.

2104
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:26,942
You gonna talk to Allison?

2105
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:28,610
Yeah, I was just about to.

2106
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:30,195
Right on.

2107
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,738
It's a doll.

2108
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,281
Thanks, Ben.

2109
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:38,954
I just don't think we can make it work.

2110
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,957
We can get back on track,
and everything's gonna be great.

2111
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,793
You're just being nice,
and I'm being nice,

2112
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:49,047
and just because we're two nice people
doesn't mean we should stay together.

2113
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:53,260
I don't want this baby to determine
the rest of our lives. You know?

2114
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,887
Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason

2115
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:59,975
to drag you into a relationship
with me. It's just not fair.

2116
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:05,230
And don't repeat this, but God,
I don't want to end up like Debbie.

2117
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:06,481
But Debbie's happy.

2118
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:08,650
Yeah, she's happy today.

2119
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,986
But every day is a constant
struggle for them

2120
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,737
because they're not
right for each other.

2121
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,864
You know? And they have to force it,
and I don't want us to have to do that.

2122
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:19,077
I don't want to force you to be
what I think you should be.

2123
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,496
That's wrong of me because you're great.

2124
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:25,667
You really are. You're great
the way you are, and...

2125
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:29,921
I mean, you like to get high, and you
like to do shrooms in Vegas.

2126
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,257
- I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
- Who am I to stop you?

2127
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:35,260
Who am I to tell you that that's wrong?
It's not wrong. It's who you are.

2128
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,929
It's what you enjoy and that's
your life and...

2129
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:41,266
I'm not that guy anymore.

2130
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,268
I mean, we can be friends.

2131
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:47,189
And you can be there
when the baby is born,

2132
01:39:47,273 --> 01:39:49,441
and in the baby's life
as much as you want.

2133
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,359
I hope you will be.

2134
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:54,779
I just... I think that if you just...

2135
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:57,866
I don't know. If you give me a shot
to just show you that I'm...

2136
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,117
- Excuse me?
- Oh, shit.

2137
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,443
Can you grab the video camera?

2138
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:03,371
- We're gonna sing Happy Birthday now.
- Yeah.

2139
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:06,291
I'm sorry. I got to go.

2140
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:07,459
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2141
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:08,793
I'll be right back, though, all right?

2142
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,296
- We'll finish talking.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, go.

2143
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:17,636
What happened?

2144
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,887
Thanks for warning me, man.

2145
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:21,890
I just walked into a fucking
buzz saw. She rejected me.

2146
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,309
'Cause you, for some insane reason,

2147
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:26,811
told Debbie that I did mushrooms
with you in Vegas!

2148
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,063
She gets mad 'cause I smoke pot!

2149
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:30,315
Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!

2150
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:32,234
Really? I thought she'd take you back.

2151
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,194
You know why she just rejected me?

2152
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,718
'Cause you're such a shitty husband,

2153
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:39,074
she thinks I'm gonna turn
into a shitty husband.

2154
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:48,166
Happy Birthday to you

2155
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:51,795
Happy Birthday to you

2156
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:56,424
- Jessica! Right here!
- Can we get a photo?

2157
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:58,510
- When are you due?
- I got two months.

2158
01:40:58,636 --> 01:40:59,761
- Really?
- Yeah.

2159
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:02,847
- Wow, you're so big already.
- Yeah.

2160
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,684
- When is that baby popping out?
- I got two months to go.

2161
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,353
- Really? Are you dilated yet? I can tell.
- Wow, wow!

2162
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:12,524
You look fantastic. You look... Are you
gonna, like, give birth right now?

2163
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:15,026
Wow, you're about
to drop any second.

2164
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,361
You know what? I love your broach.

2165
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:18,780
You don't need to lie to me.
I don't appreciate it.

2166
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:20,407
I know I look like a fat cow.

2167
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,450
- And I'm sweating profusely. I know that.
- No, no.

2168
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:26,204
No, you don't look like a fat
cow at all. You look great.

2169
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,206
So, I have to get going in.
They're calling me.

2170
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,411
Steve, hey. Help me out.
Give me an interview, please.

2171
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:31,626
Well, I just need to run in.

2172
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:34,462
You know what? Just say into the camera,
"You're watching E! Entertainment."

2173
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:35,714
- Congratulations.
- Just give me that.

2174
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:37,966
No, Steve, don't be
an asshole! Come on.

2175
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,218
I'm not being an asshole.

2176
01:41:40,886 --> 01:41:43,638
Wow, you managed to turn
Steve Carell into an asshole.

2177
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:45,682
- No easy feat.
- Shut up, Brent.

2178
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:48,310
You screwed me, Dad, okay?

2179
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:51,146
You said everything was gonna
be fine and nothing is fine.

2180
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,772
Nothing is fine.

2181
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:56,860
<i>Ben, I've been divorced three times.
Why would you listen to me?</i>

2182
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:58,445
Because you were the only one
giving me advice!

2183
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,780
And it was terrible advice!

2184
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:04,576
<i>You can go around blaming everyone
else, but in the end,</i>

2185
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:09,039
<i>until you take responsibility for yourself,
none of this is gonna work out.</i>

2186
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,125
I don't know how to take responsibility
for myself, okay?

2187
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:14,085
- I didn't read the baby books!
<i>- You didn't read the books?</i>

2188
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,755
I just smoke less pot. I don't know
what to do. I'm an idiot!

2189
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:19,049
What... Tell me what to do!

2190
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,259
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

2191
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:24,971
<i>Ben, I love you. What can
I tell you?</i>

2192
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,140
Just tell me what to do.

2193
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:32,729
Stone, you settling in okay?

2194
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:35,273
- Best job I ever had.
- Like to hear it.

2195
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:44,634
Allison, thank you
for coming in.

2196
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:50,432
I don't want to shock you
but we know what's under that jacket.

2197
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:53,435
You're pregnant, have been for a while.

2198
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:56,813
From my count, you're right
around eight months.

2199
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,774
And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us.

2200
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:01,317
I'm really sorry.

2201
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,987
This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.

2202
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:07,365
I just... I wasn't expecting this and...

2203
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:10,160
I didn't know how to handle it,
and I didn't want to lose my job.

2204
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,620
- I'm really sorry.
- It's unfortunate.

2205
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:15,457
It's unfortunate you didn't tell us because

2206
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,626
you would've found out that we
thought it's great.

2207
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:20,044
- Really?
- Yeah.

2208
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:22,672
So we did some research.

2209
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:27,469
And turns out, people like pregnant.

2210
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:28,636
Oh, my God!

2211
01:44:28,721 --> 01:44:30,441
The bigger you are, the bigger
your numbers.

2212
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:34,851
I was surprised 'cause I feel
the opposite.

2213
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:41,858
We're gonna do a whole maternity
month on E! Mommy.

2214
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:45,570
You're gonna interview
all the pregnant celebs.

2215
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:47,363
- Really?
- Yes.

2216
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:48,698
Scary!

2217
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:53,119
You're pregnant, they're pregnant,
you can talk about being pregnant.

2218
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:57,207
It just grosses me out when I know
that people are pregnant.

2219
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,043
'Cause I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.

2220
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,754
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.

2221
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:07,091
But you know, hopes, dreams,
whatever, it's gonna be great.

2222
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:09,385
Oh, my God. This is such good news.

2223
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,554
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

2224
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:15,225
And then, after the baby is out...

2225
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:18,478
- Tight.
- ...tighten it back up.

2226
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:20,480
- And please don't lie to us again.
- Okay.

2227
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:23,775
'Cause maybe someday
we could be friends.

2228
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,152
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.

2229
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:28,655
- I just don't like secrets.
- Okay.

2230
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,274
You know, it's a rare thing
that you live to see the day

2231
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,577
your wildest dreams come true.

2232
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:37,997
I mean, what is there left to want?
I get to go to Legoland.

2233
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:39,290
- Shut up, Pete.
- Say it!

2234
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,708
- Legoland!
- Legoland!

2235
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,669
Legoland!

2236
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,629
Don't get them all riled up
before the drive.

2237
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,756
I shouldn't have given them
all that meth, then.

2238
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,258
We'll be back on Sunday.

2239
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,718
Or Saturday. You never know.
We might see it all in one day.

2240
01:45:50,803 --> 01:45:52,554
Sunday. Let's go.

2241
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,264
Guess what? I'm scared
there's no one to trust.

2242
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:56,599
You can trust me.

2243
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,768
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

2244
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:00,937
Oh, for Christ's sake.

2245
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,647
You are.

2246
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:08,206
Ow, ow, ow.

2247
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:11,013
<i>That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.</i>

2248
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:17,787
Hello?

2249
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:20,123
Hey, what's up, Daddy?
What are you doing?

2250
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:24,377
Just smoking a joint, drinking
some beers, you know. Rocking.

2251
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,879
We're about to go to a new club.
You coming?

2252
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:29,591
No. I'm gonna pack
it in soon, I think.

2253
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,301
What's he doing?

2254
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:32,594
He says he's gonna
call it a night.

2255
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:34,637
Dude, it's like 8:15, man.

2256
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:37,765
Yeah, I know. I'm just tired.

2257
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,934
- Is he depressed?
- You depressed?

2258
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:41,686
No, I feel great. I like it.

2259
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:43,229
He says no.

2260
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:44,674
Ask him if he's
gonna kill himself.

2261
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:46,024
You gonna kill yourself?

2262
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:48,109
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.

2263
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:51,362
Tell him not to jerk off with a noose
around his neck. It's dangerous.

2264
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:54,448
You shouldn't jerk off with a noose
around your neck 'cause it's dangerous.

2265
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:55,950
Okay. Very good.

2266
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:59,704
And tell him if he has to, tell him he
needs a teammate or a spotter there.

2267
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:03,791
Right. And if you do, you should have
a teammate or a spotter there.

2268
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:04,959
Great.

2269
01:47:05,044 --> 01:47:07,378
He says your mom's already there.

2270
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:08,755
Uncool, man.

2271
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,222
Okay, okay.

2272
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:19,641
Okay.

2273
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:21,643
Hi, Dr. Howard?

2274
01:47:21,727 --> 01:47:23,728
No, this is Dr. Angelo.

2275
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:24,896
How can I help you?

2276
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,148
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's,

2277
01:47:27,232 --> 01:47:29,901
and I'm going into labor and
I need to speak with him.

2278
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,653
<i>I actually don't know
where he is tonight.</i>

2279
01:47:31,737 --> 01:47:34,614
But I've made myself available
to his patients,

2280
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:36,157
and I'd be happy to help you.

2281
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:38,576
Can you help me find him?
Can you give me his number?

2282
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,912
<i>Oh, no. You know what? Actually,
I'm under strict instructions</i>

2283
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,164
<i>not to give out his number, but
I can help you through this.</i>

2284
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,582
No, no. No, no, no.

2285
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,669
I want to speak to my own doctor.
You really won't give me his number?

2286
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:51,255
Because this is my first baby, and he
promised that he would be here for me

2287
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,925
and I need you to give me...
Give me his number, okay?

2288
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:55,927
Dr. Howard's not available tonight.

2289
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,513
But everything's gonna be okay,
I assure you.

2290
01:47:58,597 --> 01:48:02,600
No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are!

2291
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:06,521
I want my own goddamn doctor!
You make sure he calls me!

2292
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,606
Oh, shit. Okay.

2293
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:12,402
Oh, shit!

2294
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:25,415
Hello?

2295
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:28,209
Ben, it's me. Can you come? 'Cause
the baby's coming. Can you come?

2296
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:32,130
Oh, God. Allison. I'm so happy
you're calling.

2297
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,799
I have so many thing's I've been
wanting to say to you.

2298
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:37,385
I wanna apologize for things.
It's all I can think about.

2299
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:38,970
No, listen. Wait. Listen.

2300
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:41,347
I need you to come help me, okay?
Because the baby's coming.

2301
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:42,598
So can you come help me?

2302
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:44,761
- Wait. The baby's coming right now?
<i>- Yes. Right now.</i>

2303
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:46,894
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2304
01:48:46,979 --> 01:48:50,356
Is it happening? It's happening now?
Push. Push...

2305
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:53,919
- Breathe like this...
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

2306
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:56,696
You need to come now because
the contractions are happening,

2307
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:00,074
and they really hurt and the doctor isn't
here, and I can't get hold of him.

2308
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:03,953
And he said he was gonna be here, right?
You were there when he said that.

2309
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:05,663
Okay, okay, I'll come right now.

2310
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:07,248
<i>- Nobody's here.</i>
- I'm coming right now.

2311
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,250
...not anywhere, I can't reach
them, please.

2312
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:10,835
- Please, please hurry.
<i>- I'll just... So should I...</i>

2313
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:12,003
I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?

2314
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:15,465
No! Don't meet me at the hospital! No, no,
I need you to drive me. I can't drive.

2315
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,258
- I can't drive like this.
<i>- No? You can't drive? Okay.</i>

2316
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:18,968
I'll get gas and then I'll pick you up.

2317
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,887
- You have to get gas?
<i>- I need to just get cash.</i>

2318
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,472
No. Don't get cash. Just come.

2319
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:25,436
I need to get cash because my car's
on empty, I won't even make it there.

2320
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:29,061
No, just come right now. I'm not
fucking around, okay?

2321
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:30,772
This is serious and I'm alone.

2322
01:49:30,856 --> 01:49:34,066
It's the last thing you need to do is...
Just get here!

2323
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:36,277
Look, if you keep yelling at me,
I'm never gonna get there.

2324
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,112
You just need to calm down
for two... Okay.

2325
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,998
Don't run out of gas. Don't run
out of gas. Come on!

2326
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:55,338
Hello?

2327
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:59,675
Please be in there.
Hello? Hello? Hello?

2328
01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:04,013
Allison?

2329
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:11,646
Hello?

2330
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,523
- Ben?
- Allison.

2331
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:15,928
What is this, like a water birth?

2332
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:18,069
What are we doing? Should we go?
Should I... I have the...

2333
01:50:18,094 --> 01:50:18,802
Shh.

2334
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:23,366
Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, 'cause
that's what this is all about.

2335
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,493
Because if it gets too stressful in here,

2336
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,995
then the baby is born into a
stressful environment,

2337
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:32,250
and then he's wired for stress
for the rest of his life. So just...

2338
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:35,795
Just be calm.

2339
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,046
Okay.

2340
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:41,425
Okay, let's relax. Okay.

2341
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:43,719
Do you want to talk about things?

2342
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:46,055
I feel really bad about, like,
a lot of the shit I did.

2343
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:47,598
I can't believe
I said some of that.

2344
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:48,975
That's all I think about
in my head.

2345
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,351
I don't wanna talk about it.

2346
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:54,021
But maybe we could bring the baby
into a reconciled place so we can talk...

2347
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:56,357
No. I don't wanna go there.

2348
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:59,694
Don't go there. Okay?
Help me stay relaxed.

2349
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,821
So, what should I do?

2350
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:03,447
You need to call Dr. Howard.

2351
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:05,700
<i>Hello?</i>

2352
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:10,788
Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone. I'm
calling on behalf of Allison Scott.

2353
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:12,540
<i>We need Dr. Howard.
It's an emergency.</i>

2354
01:51:12,624 --> 01:51:15,209
Yeah. He's at San Francisco
at bar mitzvah.

2355
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:18,671
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco?
Do you know when he gets back?

2356
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,298
<i>In three days.</i>

2357
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:23,467
Do you have his cell number,
by any chance?

2358
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:29,849
Hey! Good news.

2359
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:32,810
I got his number right here.
I'm gonna call him right now.

2360
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:36,063
Oh, great. Thank you so much. Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.

2361
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:38,900
I'm glad I'm here, too.
Thank you.

2362
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:40,693
I shouldn't have told you
you were a fucking lunatic.

2363
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:43,112
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel terrible about it and...

2364
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:46,032
No, it's okay. We're past it.
We're past it.

2365
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,636
I'm sorry I told you
to fuck your bong.

2366
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,077
It's okay. I didn't.

2367
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:53,164
Let's just drop it now.
We're over it.

2368
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,375
I'm gonna call him right now.
You're doing so great.

2369
01:51:56,460 --> 01:52:00,546
<i>Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here
right now. Please leave a message.</i>

2370
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:04,258
Hey, Doc Howard.
Ben Stone calling.

2371
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,260
Guess what the fuck's up?

2372
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:09,305
Allison's going into labor and
you are not fucking here.

2373
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:12,808
Now, where are you? You're at
a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,

2374
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,894
you motherfucking piece of shit!

2375
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:16,270
And you know what I'm gonna have to do now?

2376
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:17,480
I'm gonna have to kill you.

2377
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,982
I'm gonna have to pop a fucking
cap in your ass.

2378
01:52:20,108 --> 01:52:21,817
You're dead! You're Tupac!

2379
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:23,903
You are fucking Biggie,
you piece of shit!

2380
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,196
I hope you fucking die

2381
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:28,449
or drop the fucking chair
and kill that fucking kid!

2382
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:30,993
Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!

2383
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:38,918
- Hey.
- Hey.

2384
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:40,086
Did you talk to him?

2385
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:44,674
I didn't talk to him directly. I left him
a very nice message, though.

2386
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,426
And... Okay.

2387
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:50,096
What I'm about to tell you
isn't that bad.

2388
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,722
You should know that going in.

2389
01:52:51,807 --> 01:52:54,684
We can get through this,
and it's just a little hiccough,

2390
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:56,170
but everything will be fine. Okay?

2391
01:52:56,186 --> 01:52:58,521
Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?

2392
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:01,023
- I can deal with it.
- Okay.

2393
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,860
So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.

2394
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,278
A bar mitzvah?

2395
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:07,989
It's a Jewish rite of passage.

2396
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:11,659
And he's gonna be there
for the next three days,

2397
01:53:11,743 --> 01:53:15,037
so he will not be able
to be here tonight.

2398
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:16,414
Oh, no.

2399
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:19,917
It's okay.

2400
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,169
What do you think we should do?

2401
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:23,587
Okay. I know exactly what to do.

2402
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:26,382
All we do is we'll get in the car,
I'll drive to the hospital,

2403
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,135
and on the way, we will call every
gynecologist we've met.

2404
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:32,138
Someone will be available.
You know?

2405
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:34,140
- Okay. I can do that.
- Okay. Good.

2406
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,064
I mean, we still have time. I mean,
how far apart are your contractions?

2407
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:39,770
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes!

2408
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:41,981
See? Not until four minutes
is it really coming.

2409
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:43,816
And has your water broken, even?

2410
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,152
I don't know. I'm in the tub.

2411
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,529
That's a good point. Have you had
your bloody show?

2412
01:53:48,613 --> 01:53:49,822
What? What's that?

2413
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:52,491
It's, it's... I mean, it's a bloody
mucusy discharge.

2414
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:54,869
But it only comes out right before
the baby's gonna come,

2415
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:56,787
so if that hasn't happened,
we have time.

2416
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:59,665
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.

2417
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,876
You read the baby books.

2418
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:05,546
Yeah. I did. I read three
of them, actually.

2419
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:07,631
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2420
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:13,429
Hey. Hey, you okay?

2421
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:17,767
Okay.

2422
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:24,982
Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

2423
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:28,819
It's okay. I stole this
from Martin's grandma.

2424
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:31,822
- Oh, that was really sweet of you.
- Thanks.

2425
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:36,494
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

2426
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,621
Okay. Inches away.

2427
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:40,706
- Okay.
- We're close.

2428
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:45,169
Home stretch. Hello. This is Allison Scott.

2429
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:47,296
Dr. Kuni said he would let you
know we were coming?

2430
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,965
- Oh, he did. We'll take good care of you.
- Okay.

2431
01:54:50,092 --> 01:54:51,217
- Samuel?
- Yeah?

2432
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:54,678
This is Allison Scott. Please admit
her into Room 307.

2433
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:55,846
Hi.

2434
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:57,223
Hey.

2435
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:58,808
You're our nurse?

2436
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,936
That's why I'm holding
the clipboard.

2437
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,397
So, what else is up
with you guys?

2438
01:55:05,482 --> 01:55:08,192
I'm just joking. Let's have a baby, huh?

2439
01:55:08,276 --> 01:55:09,360
Yeah.

2440
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:14,073
Jeez, I'm sorry it took me so long
to find that vein.

2441
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:18,160
That little guy really didn't
want me to find him.

2442
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:20,079
Is that the baby on that
one right there?

2443
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:21,247
Yeah.

2444
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,582
So we can tell how the little
guy or gal is doing.

2445
01:55:23,667 --> 01:55:24,917
Okay.

2446
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:29,255
Hello, Allison. Ben.
Interesting night.

2447
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:31,298
We really, really appreciate
you coming, man.

2448
01:55:31,383 --> 01:55:35,302
What else do I have to do, I mean,
besides sleep? Totally kidding.

2449
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:36,720
What happened to your doctor?

2450
01:55:36,805 --> 01:55:38,848
He's at a bar mitzvah
in San Francisco.

2451
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:40,558
He didn't tell us, though.

2452
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:41,809
- Nice.
- Yeah.

2453
01:55:41,893 --> 01:55:45,396
Lucky for you, I don't have
any Jewish friends.

2454
01:55:45,522 --> 01:55:48,482
Dr. Kuni, I really wanna do this
naturally. I don't wanna use drugs.

2455
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:52,153
Okay, let's just take a look
and see what happens, okay?

2456
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:54,530
Foetal heart rate is good.
Samuel, where are we?

2457
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:57,533
- Four centimeters.
- Four centimeters what?

2458
01:55:57,617 --> 01:55:59,785
- Dilated?
- Dilated. That's right. Focus.

2459
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:02,371
Pay attention, okay?
We're a team. Okay?

2460
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,791
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

2461
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:06,959
What?

2462
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:08,335
I just wanna get the fuck out of here.

2463
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:10,087
Okay. Just relax,
man, just relax.

2464
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:11,797
Oh, man, I don't fucking
like hospitals.

2465
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:14,341
I know, but, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

2466
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:19,722
I just think you need to relax and embrace
the beauty of another life joining our gang.

2467
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:22,266
We're having a baby.
We are having a baby.

2468
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:25,102
I'm not having shit besides
a fucking panic attack.

2469
01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:29,481
There's probably a fucking room
back there full of dead bodies!

2470
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,275
You guys wanna be here
when one rolls out

2471
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:34,069
and just fucking coughs
malaria into our face?

2472
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:36,739
- Jesus.
- Fucking shit.

2473
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:40,618
- Is that good?
- Oh, yeah.

2474
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:43,412
Oh, yeah, get in there.

2475
01:56:43,496 --> 01:56:44,580
I could do this all day.

2476
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:45,789
Cool.

2477
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,835
- What was that?
- What the hell was that?

2478
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:56,842
What's happening?

2479
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:59,053
Well, boys and girls, what
seems to be the problem?

2480
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:01,055
- Decels.
- Oh, dear.

2481
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,099
Okay, Allison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay?

2482
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,727
The baby's heart rate
is slowing. Okay?

2483
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:08,395
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

2484
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:11,106
- It's gonna be fine. Is it gonna be fine?
- It's gonna be fine. Okay?

2485
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:15,402
You'll feel a little bit of a push.
You'll feel a little bit of...

2486
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,446
- Oh.
- What are you doing?

2487
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:21,700
I'm turning the baby so I can take
the pressure off the cord. Okay?

2488
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,953
Oh, my God.

2489
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,204
Okay, we're good.

2490
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:27,206
The heartbeat's stronger, but we're
not out of the woods.

2491
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,666
We need to get things going now.

2492
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:31,043
I think the cord is wrapped
around the neck.

2493
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:34,127
So I'm gonna give you some medicine,
pop the bag and get things going, okay?

2494
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:35,970
I don't wanna leave the baby
in there for long,

2495
01:57:36,007 --> 01:57:37,508
and we can give you
some medicine for the pain.

2496
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:39,134
No, no, no, no.

2497
01:57:39,219 --> 01:57:41,579
I don't... I don't want the baby to
be born all drugged out.

2498
01:57:41,638 --> 01:57:42,930
It's not my birth plan.

2499
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:44,932
Now, things change. We don't
have time to debate this.

2500
01:57:45,016 --> 01:57:48,269
What? No. But no, I'm not
comfortable with that. I'm not.

2501
01:57:48,353 --> 01:57:50,229
No. Would you please
just listen to her?

2502
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,398
Fine. Do what you want to do.

2503
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,692
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
- Should I leave?

2504
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:57,444
Do you want to be the doctor?
Because I really don't need to be here.

2505
01:57:57,529 --> 01:58:00,209
No. What we want is to take a second
to talk about our options, okay?

2506
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,324
- That's all we want.
- No. You mean you want to take a second

2507
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:03,909
to tell me how to do my job.

2508
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:06,954
My job is to get that baby out safely.

2509
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:10,374
Or I can go home. Just let me know.
You be the doctor.

2510
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,876
Can we talk outside in the
hall for a second?

2511
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:15,087
That woman is a control freak,

2512
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,923
and she needs to let go and
let me do my job.

2513
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:19,368
Look, she's just having
a hard time

2514
01:58:19,384 --> 01:58:22,136
because her and our doctor had
a very specific birth plan.

2515
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:24,763
And they wanted it to be
a very special experience.

2516
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:27,683
If you want a special experience,
go to a Jimmy Buffett concert.

2517
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:31,353
We have a new birth plan.
Get the baby out safely.

2518
01:58:31,438 --> 01:58:36,483
Look, man, will you help us out?
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2519
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:40,571
You can be as big a dick to me as you
want. Just be nice to her, man.

2520
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:43,615
That's all I ask. Just please
be nice to her.

2521
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:51,165
Are you okay?

2522
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,125
I think so.

2523
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:55,169
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

2524
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:56,795
Thank you, man. Thanks.

2525
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,215
This is healthy. This is good.
I think we're bonding.

2526
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:13,437
Allison, I apologize for being a little
brash, but if you're okay with it,

2527
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:15,189
it's rather important
we break the bag

2528
01:59:15,273 --> 01:59:17,524
and give you some medicine
to speed things up.

2529
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:21,528
Because once the bag is broken,
I don't want there to be an infection.

2530
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:24,114
Whatever. Do what you have to do.

2531
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:31,330
Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is.

2532
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:33,707
I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.

2533
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:36,502
I think he'll be more cool now.

2534
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,465
I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

2535
01:59:42,342 --> 01:59:44,009
You really don't need to be.

2536
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:47,262
And, you know, I knew you'd
give me another shot.

2537
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:51,767
I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?

2538
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:55,145
I was just in such a panic
from all of this.

2539
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:59,525
And watching Debbie
and Pete together, it's...

2540
01:59:59,609 --> 02:00:01,693
- And my ass got so fat.
- No, no.

2541
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,070
It did.

2542
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:06,615
I just never, for one minute, thought that
the guy who got me pregnant

2543
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:09,493
would actually be the right guy for me.

2544
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,703
- Me, either.
- I guess he is.

2545
02:00:11,788 --> 02:00:12,871
Yeah.

2546
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:18,127
All right, Martin, who am I?

2547
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:25,217
"People think I'm smart because
I speak in a robot voice."

2548
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:26,885
Stephen Hawking.

2549
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:31,849
"I fuck my nurse with my
ever-expanding cock."

2550
02:00:34,811 --> 02:00:36,228
All right. Let's murderball.

2551
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:38,897
Come here! I'm gonna murderball you!

2552
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:40,342
- Stay down!
- Jonah, you shithead!

2553
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:43,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

2554
02:00:43,194 --> 02:00:44,361
Hi.

2555
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:46,488
I can't believe I go out of
town and this happens.

2556
02:00:46,573 --> 02:00:49,158
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm
not going anywhere.

2557
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:50,909
- Screw Legoland.
- All right.

2558
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,314
Hey, how do you want this?
You want this over the shoulder?

2559
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:55,569
You know, I can do whatever
you want. I can get in there.

2560
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:57,040
Kind of Spike Lee angles.

2561
02:00:57,167 --> 02:01:00,169
No, you can shoot the waiting
room. That would be great.

2562
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:05,174
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
I've got it from here.

2563
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:06,925
Debbie.

2564
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,011
Can I talk to you in the hall
for a second?

2565
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:10,262
Why?

2566
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:16,560
I'd like to be in there with
Allison, without you.

2567
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:17,978
Okay.

2568
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:22,483
I understand how you feel
but this isn't up to you.

2569
02:01:22,567 --> 02:01:27,946
Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass
if you think you're coming into that room.

2570
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:31,033
If you take one step towards
that door, I will tell security

2571
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:34,495
there's a crazy chick in a pink
dress snatching up babies. Okay?

2572
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:38,415
So don't even try to come into
that room. That's my room now.

2573
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:41,668
That little area with the Pepsi
machine, that's your area.

2574
02:01:41,753 --> 02:01:46,465
My room. Your area. Stay in your area.
Stay out of my room.

2575
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,218
Back the fuck off.

2576
02:01:58,394 --> 02:02:00,479
What are you doing here?

2577
02:02:00,563 --> 02:02:03,565
He just kicked me out.
He told me to leave.

2578
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:06,902
Oh.

2579
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:10,405
But I guess it's good, right?

2580
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:12,741
He said he's gonna
take care of her.

2581
02:02:12,825 --> 02:02:15,202
He really seems on his game.

2582
02:02:15,286 --> 02:02:17,955
I think he's gonna be a good dad.

2583
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:20,165
I think I like him.

2584
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,667
Thank God.

2585
02:02:24,837 --> 02:02:26,964
I wish I'd gotten that on tape.

2586
02:02:28,299 --> 02:02:31,218
Go! Holy shit, almighty!

2587
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:33,470
Oh, shit, this really hurts!

2588
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:35,472
- I see we're well on our way.
- Okay.

2589
02:02:35,598 --> 02:02:37,808
I want the... I want the epidural. Okay?

2590
02:02:37,934 --> 02:02:39,559
- Give me the epidural!
- Give her the epidural, okay?

2591
02:02:39,644 --> 02:02:41,186
- Give it to her now.
- Okay, Allison.

2592
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:45,065
We're past the point of an epidural.
Okay? The cervix is fully dilated.

2593
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:48,151
No, seriously, I want an epidural!
I know there's time!

2594
02:02:48,278 --> 02:02:50,279
- We can't give you the epidural.
- Take the time! I...

2595
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:52,948
I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
I'll stop pushing.

2596
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:54,199
- We have time.
- Just do it, please!

2597
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:55,764
- I'll stop.
- Please, please, please!

2598
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:57,202
I'm sorry. We have no time.

2599
02:02:57,287 --> 02:02:59,913
We're gonna just have to do
this the all-natural way, okay?

2600
02:02:59,998 --> 02:03:01,707
The way you wanted to do it.

2601
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,458
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay.

2602
02:03:03,543 --> 02:03:08,046
Here comes another contraction, okay?
I want you to push. Okay, ready?

2603
02:03:09,299 --> 02:03:11,550
- Good, good, good.
- I feel everything!

2604
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,302
Oh, my God! It's happening!

2605
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:15,762
Okay, maybe we can
take it down just a little.

2606
02:03:15,847 --> 02:03:17,597
I think you're gonna scare
the other pregnant women.

2607
02:03:17,682 --> 02:03:19,641
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Okay.

2608
02:03:19,726 --> 02:03:21,059
Are you kidding me?

2609
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:24,521
Jesus.

2610
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,691
This is messed up. Something's
wrong in there.

2611
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:28,984
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, no.

2612
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:30,819
I mean, granted, gynecology's
only a hobby of mine,

2613
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:33,155
but it sounds to me like she's
crowning. Is that right, Deb?

2614
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:34,698
Yeah. That's what it sounds
like for everyone.

2615
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:36,450
Everyone goes through this.

2616
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:40,329
No, I disagree with you.
That sounds terrible.

2617
02:03:41,998 --> 02:03:44,499
I'm gonna go sneak a peak,
see if there's anything I can do.

2618
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:51,423
Okay! It's crowning!
I'm seeing the head!

2619
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:52,674
Oh, God.

2620
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:54,801
- What does it look like, Ben?
- Oh, God.

2621
02:03:54,886 --> 02:03:56,386
- What?
- You don't wanna see it.

2622
02:03:56,512 --> 02:03:58,805
- No, I wanna see it!
- It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.

2623
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:01,725
- No, I want to see it!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

2624
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:04,436
Okay, we're almost home!
One, two...

2625
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,855
You okay in here? Jesus!

2626
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:09,149
- Get out!
- Yeah, okay.

2627
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:10,317
Oh, no!

2628
02:04:13,529 --> 02:04:15,405
You all right, buddy?

2629
02:04:16,532 --> 02:04:17,783
It's okay.

2630
02:04:19,744 --> 02:04:20,952
What did it look like?

2631
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,621
I shouldn't have gone in there.

2632
02:04:22,705 --> 02:04:25,248
Don't go in there. Promise me
you don't go in there.

2633
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:27,918
Me, go in there? That's the last
fucking place I wanna go.

2634
02:04:28,044 --> 02:04:29,461
Like I'm gonna go in there.

2635
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:31,171
Try getting a boner now.

2636
02:04:31,255 --> 02:04:32,631
What's up, Deb?

2637
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:33,840
Hey.

2638
02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:40,680
- Push. One, two, three.
- Oh, God!

2639
02:04:40,765 --> 02:04:44,059
You've passed the shoulders.
One more big push.

2640
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:47,104
Good.

2641
02:04:52,944 --> 02:04:54,152
I did it.

2642
02:04:54,237 --> 02:04:57,030
- Okay. Oh, my God. It's out.
- You did it. You did it.

2643
02:04:57,115 --> 02:04:59,491
- Oh, my God, you did it.
- Oh, my God.

2644
02:05:02,787 --> 02:05:04,162
Oh, God.

2645
02:05:06,749 --> 02:05:09,376
- I love you, Ben.
- I love you so much, too.

2646
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:10,544
Oh, my God.

2647
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:13,338
- Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

2648
02:05:13,423 --> 02:05:16,967
- You did so great. You were amazing.
- Thank you.

2649
02:05:17,093 --> 02:05:19,469
Okay, pretty baby.

2650
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:21,179
You got out.

2651
02:05:21,264 --> 02:05:23,765
You made it out. Welcome.

2652
02:05:25,935 --> 02:05:28,979
You ever get so bored you
just stare at your balls?

2653
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:31,440
I bet you do, late John Lennon.

2654
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:35,235
Here we are again.

2655
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:37,279
Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi?

2656
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:39,531
Is he the one who cuts the penis?

2657
02:05:41,033 --> 02:05:42,951
I think it's Matisyahu.

2658
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,454
Awesome.

2659
02:05:45,538 --> 02:05:47,664
- You want out of the bet?
- I want out of the bet.

2660
02:05:47,790 --> 02:05:52,752
You know what you have to say. Just
say it, man. I think now is the time.

2661
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:55,422
Jason, you're the master.

2662
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:56,798
- You heard it, right?
- Yeah.

2663
02:05:56,883 --> 02:05:59,468
All right. You're out of the bet.
Yeah, now you're done.

2664
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:01,386
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God.

2665
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:03,430
Your face smells like an old man's balls.

2666
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:05,307
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, fucking hell.

2667
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:08,351
Hey.

2668
02:06:13,149 --> 02:06:15,192
Oh, my God.

2669
02:06:15,318 --> 02:06:17,194
Oh, hello.

2670
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,321
Oh, my goodness.

2671
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,574
She's beautiful.

2672
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:26,786
Hello.

2673
02:06:26,871 --> 02:06:29,664
- Oh. I love you, Ben.
- I love you, Debbie.

2674
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:33,460
We're gonna have another baby.
Okay.

2675
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:34,878
Hello, baby.

2676
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:36,963
Gentlemen, it's a girl!

2677
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,386
We got a daughter! Mazel tov!

2678
02:06:43,513 --> 02:06:46,264
- Congratulations, Daddy!
- We got a beautiful little girl!

2679
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:49,351
- Let's meet her! She's awesome!
- A beautiful little girl!

2680
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:53,188
And then your mommy said,
"Just do it, already,"

2681
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:56,733
which was very confusing
to Daddy.

2682
02:06:56,859 --> 02:07:01,196
So I listened to the most literal translation
of that and I just did it, already.

2683
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,156
What would you do?

2684
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:04,866
Don't tell Mommy,

2685
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:09,162
but it was the smartest thing I ever did,
listening to her, 'cause now you're here.

2686
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:11,998
- Isn't that nice?
- I think it is.

2687
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,214
Hi, you.

2688
02:07:23,386 --> 02:07:25,586
I hope your apartment is big enough
for the three of us.

2689
02:07:25,596 --> 02:07:27,097
Oh, it definitely is.

2690
02:07:27,223 --> 02:07:30,058
That's why I got one in East LA,
the rent. It's huge!

2691
02:07:30,142 --> 02:07:31,542
The only thing is we have to decide

2692
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:33,895
if we're gonna be Crips or Bloods
before we get there.

2693
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:36,439
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue.

2694
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:37,816
The fighting continues.

2695
02:07:39,318 --> 02:07:41,518
We could just throw off everyone
and become Latin Kings.

2696
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:42,654
Yeah.

2697
02:07:42,738 --> 02:07:43,947
We both look good in gold.

2698
02:07:44,031 --> 02:07:45,365
Yeah.

2699
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:47,659
Good choice.

2700
02:07:47,743 --> 02:07:51,288
I would yell at you about driving
so slow, except the baby's here.

2701
02:07:51,414 --> 02:07:54,833
No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than 12.

2702
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:57,117
It might take us around three
hours to get home, though.
