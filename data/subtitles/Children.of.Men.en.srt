00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,302
<i>Day 1,000
of the siege of Seattle.</i>

2
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,262
<i>The Muslim community demands an end</i>

3
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:41,348
<i>to the Army's occupation of mosques.</i>

4
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,768
<i>The Homeland Security bill is ratified.</i>

5
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:46,813
<i>After eight years,
British borders will remain closed.</i>

6
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,816
<i>The deportation of illegal immigrants
will continue.</i>

7
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,942
<i>Good morning. Our lead story.</i>

8
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>The world was stunned
today by the death of Diego Ricardo,</i>

9
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,874
<i>the youngest person on the planet.</i>

10
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:01,159
<i>Baby Diego was stabbed
outside a bar in Buenos Aires</i>

11
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,829
<i>after refusing to sign an autograph.</i>

12
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>Witnesses at the scene say...</i>

13
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,415
Excuse me.

14
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:10,128
<i>...that Diego spat in the face of a fan
who asked for an autograph.</i>

15
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,004
<i>He was killed in the ensuing brawl.</i>

16
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,713
<i>The fan was later beaten to death...</i>

17
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:15,007
Coffee, please. Black.

18
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,466
<i>...by the angry crowd.</i>

19
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:21,180
<i>Born in 2009,
the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo,</i>

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,807
<i>a working-class couple from Mendoza,</i>

21
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:27,186
<i>he struggled all his life
with the celebrity status</i>

22
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:30,073
<i>thrust upon him
as the world's youngest person.</i>

23
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:39,031
<i>Diego Ricardo,
the youngest person on the planet</i>

24
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,908
<i>was 18 years, 4 months,</i>

25
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,882
<i>20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.</i>

26
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,870
<i>Throughout his life,</i>

27
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,872
<i>Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder</i>

28
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:15,169
<i>of the 18 years of infertility
that humanity has endured</i>

29
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,631
<i>and its effect upon the
world we now live in.</i>

30
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:23,468
<i>It seems that the mantle of the world's
youngest human has passed to a woman.</i>

31
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,274
<i>She is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old.</i>

32
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,269
Faron.

33
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,778
Mr. Griffiths.

34
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:38,784
I seem to be more affected
by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir.

35
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:43,030
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if I could finish my day's work at home.

36
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:46,793
<i>...generation needs
to reject family and society.</i>

37
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>He's my dentist.</i>

38
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,185
<i>She's my house cleaner.</i>

39
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,562
<i>WOMAN ON TV 22 He's the waiter.</i>

40
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,854
<i>She's my cousin.</i>

41
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,689
<i>They are illegal immigrants.</i>

42
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,286
<i>To hire, feed or shelter
illegal immigrants is a crime.</i>

43
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,297
<i>It's your life.</i>

44
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,050
<i>It's your choice.</i>

45
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:02,401
Hey, amigo!

46
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,036
Jasper!

47
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,874
Good to see you. Come on.

48
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,245
<i>You know who did it?</i>

49
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,706
<i>Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows.</i>

50
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,582
<i>I'll bet it was the government.</i>

51
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:21,754
<i>Every time one of our politicians
is in trouble, a bomb explodes.</i>

52
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,014
<i>It's the second time in a month.</i>

53
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,759
You okay?

54
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,269
It was horrible.

55
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,605
I'm glad you don't take
cream or sugar, amigo.

56
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,769
Losing you and Baby Diego
on the same day would be too hard to bear.

57
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,771
Well, that was even worse,
everybody crying.

58
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,441
I mean, Baby Diego, come on.
That guy was a wanker.

59
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,237
Yeah, but he was
the youngest wanker on Earth.

60
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,737
Pull my finger. Quick, quick!

61
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,707
Jasper...

62
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,784
Fucking hell! That's disgusting!

63
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,591
Illegal immigrants.
Taking them to Bexhill.

64
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,375
Poor fugees.

65
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:04,629
After escaping the worst atrocities
and finally making it to England,

66
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,100
our government hunts them down
like cockroaches.

67
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:23,481
Any girls?

68
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,608
No.

69
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,319
What about the one
we had lunch with? Lauren?

70
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,154
Lorna. That was ages ago.

71
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,822
I liked her. What happened?

72
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,492
She decided to renounce.

73
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:37,288
Renouncers? Are those the ones
that kneel down for a month for salvation?

74
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,122
No. They're the Repenters.

75
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:42,584
The Renouncers flagellate themselves
for the forgiveness of humanity.

76
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,127
Oh, right.

77
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,432
Dating ain't what it used
to be, is it, amigo?

78
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,637
What'd you do on your birthday?

79
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,723
Nothing.

80
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,516
Come on.
You must've done something.

81
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,310
No. Same as every other day.

82
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,812
Woke up, felt like shit,
went to work, felt like shit.

83
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,857
That's called a hangover, amigo.

84
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,701
At least with a hangover,
I feel something.

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,997
Honestly, Jasper, sometimes...

86
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,166
You could always come and live with us.

87
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:17,369
Yeah, but if I did that,
I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

88
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:38,807
Look who it is. It's Theo.

89
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,601
- Hey, Janice, how you doing?
- It's Theo.

90
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:43,904
Your rebel with a lost cause.

91
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:50,151
She loves this color.

92
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,913
Don't you, darling? You love it.

93
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,928
"Is there a chance
it will not work for me?"

94
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,257
"There have been no cases
of anyone surviving"

95
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,716
"who has taken the preparation."

96
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:15,134
Daddy government
hands out suicide kits

97
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,471
and anti-depressants in the rations,

98
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,940
but ganja is still illegal.

99
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,101
Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.

100
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,980
This bloke buys it from me
and smuggles it in.

101
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,106
Guess what he does? His real job?

102
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,033
Immigration cop.

103
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,744
Bravo!

104
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:37,082
One of the many perks of having
a refugee camp in the neighborhood.

105
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,254
Come on, taste that.

106
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,095
Cough.

107
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,847
- Cough?
- Cough.

108
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,315
You taste it? Strawberries.

109
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,150
This is Strawberry Cough.

110
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:07,145
So, Human Project is having this dinner

111
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,855
and all the wisest men
in the world are there...

112
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:12,076
"Human Project."
Why do people believe this crap?

113
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,864
You know, even if these people existed
with these facilities in secret locations...

114
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,791
Fuck me, that's strong.

115
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,786
Even if they discovered
the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.

116
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:25,465
Too late. The world went to shit.

117
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,499
You know what?

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,600
It was too late before the infertility thing
happened, for fuck's sake.

119
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,932
I was just trying to tell a joke, man.

120
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,134
I'm sorry. Go on.

121
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,011
- No, I'm not telling it now.
- No, come on, Jasper.

122
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,556
- No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you.
- It's all right. Go on.

123
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:46,268
Okay. The Human Project
gives this great big dinner

124
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,854
for all the scientists
and sages in the world.

125
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,357
They're tossing around theories
about the ultimate mystery,

126
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:57,205
why are women infertile?
Why can't we make babies anymore?

127
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,198
Some of them say
it's genetic experiments,

128
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,451
gamma rays, pollution.
Same old, same old.

129
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:06,788
Anyway, in the corner,
this Englishman's sitting.

130
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,259
He hasn't said a word.
He's just tucking into his dinner.

131
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,543
So they decide to ask him.

132
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:15,389
They say, "Well, why do you think
we can't make babies anymore?"

133
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:19,884
And he looks up at them,
and he's chewing on this great big wing,

134
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,063
and he says, "I haven't
the faintest idea," he said.

135
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,441
"But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?"

136
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,028
Eating a fucking stork.

137
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:32,030
Eating the stork.

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,868
<i>Italia.</i>

139
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:42,365
You okay, amigo?

140
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:46,620
Yeah. My ears are still
ringing from earlier.

141
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,424
Well, a little Zen music
won't bother you, then, will it?

142
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:16,533
<i>Good morning.
The time is 7:59 a.m.</i>

143
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,255
<i>British citizens,</i>

144
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:43,602
<i>hold out your I.D. cards.
All others, follow instructions.</i>

145
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:50,433
What the fuck?

146
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:53,071
Move along! Move along!

147
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,803
This is him.

148
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,131
- Get your fucking head down!
- Walk!

149
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,009
Get your fucking head down!

150
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,177
Okay. Okay.

151
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,260
Get in!

152
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,428
Get him in! Get him in!

153
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:28,554
Get his fucking legs.

154
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,274
Go, go, go, go!

155
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,980
You are under
the jurisdiction of the Fishes.

156
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,857
The Fishes are at war
with the British government

157
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,360
until they recognize
equal rights for every immigrant in Britain.

158
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,904
We're not gonna hurt you.
We just want to talk.

159
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,115
But don't do anything stupid.

160
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,826
- Uncover him.
- It isn't safe.

161
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,168
Do it.

162
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,975
Hello, Theo.

163
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:09,187
It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

164
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,644
You scared the shit out of me.

165
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,691
I'm sorry about the theatrics,
but we had no choice.

166
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:23,192
The police have been
a pain in the ass lately.

167
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,820
How have you been?

168
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,789
Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

169
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,543
Cut the lights.

170
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,221
The police keep using
that old photo of you in the posters.

171
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,338
It doesn't do you justice.

172
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,216
What do the police
know about justice?

173
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,634
What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

174
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:50,261
The Fishes fight for equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain!

175
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,304
He knows what we do.

176
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,347
I know you almost blew me up
in a coffee shop yesterday.

177
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,432
My ears are still ringing.

178
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,808
- We don't bomb.
- That was the government.

179
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,101
That's what they do to spread the fear.

180
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,187
What about Liverpool?

181
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,897
After Liverpool,
we stopped bombing.

182
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,815
We started speaking to the people.

183
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,744
And they're joining us, Theo.
British people, too.

184
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,445
I don't talk politics.

185
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,863
That's all you ever used to do.

186
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,615
That was 20 years ago.

187
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,833
I'm a lot more successful now.

188
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,619
Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

189
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,422
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on!

190
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,172
You're smoking?

191
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,099
Yeah. It's not working.

192
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,311
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

193
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,763
Were your parents in New York
when it happened?

194
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,639
- Yeah.
- Shit.

195
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,860
Yeah, well, that's the world
we live in now, isn't it?

196
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,394
Why am I here, Jules?

197
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,648
I need your help.
I need transit papers.

198
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,192
Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

199
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:48,320
Need to get her to the coast,
past security checkpoints.

200
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,157
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years
and you come asking me for transit papers?

201
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,366
Can you do it?

202
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,253
I don't see how.

203
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:56,620
You could ask your cousin.

204
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,456
The government finances his Ark of the Arts.
He has access to papers.

205
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:01,541
Yeah, but he'd never do it.

206
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,168
He would if you asked him.

207
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,138
I can't. It's too dangerous.

208
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:12,436
I can get you £5,000.
I know you need the money.

209
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,855
What are you talking about?

210
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:17,807
I don't fucking need your money.

211
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:19,985
Right. Sorry.

212
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,613
My mistake.

213
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,613
You know that ringing
in your ears? That...

214
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,744
That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
Like their swan song.

215
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:41,215
Once it's gone,
you'll never hear that frequency again.

216
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,509
Enjoy it while it lasts.

217
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:47,671
This never fucking happened,

218
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:50,966
so don't go telling tales,
'cause we'll be watching you.

219
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,509
At work, when you sleep,

220
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,139
when you have a piss, we'll be watching.
All the fucking time.

221
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,442
Jeez, your breath stinks.

222
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,394
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

223
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,105
It was Julian's idea bringing you here.

224
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,981
She put herself at great risk.

225
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,275
Now you know about
the five grand we can offer you.

226
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,568
So if you change your mind,

227
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,496
pin this to the notice board
at Camden tube. We'll do the rest.

228
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,048
Here you are. Bus fare.

229
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,620
<i>Earthquakes! Pollution!</i>

230
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,923
<i>Disease and famine!</i>

231
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,259
<i>Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!</i>

232
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,932
And in his anger he has taken away
his most precious gift to us!

233
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:54,131
Mr. Faron, the minister is
expecting you. This way, sir.

234
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,508
I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.

235
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,853
You got something in your teeth.

236
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,778
If you'll excuse me.

237
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:32,845
Couldn't save La Pietà.
Smashed up before we got there.

238
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,464
Pretty rummy, huh?

239
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,976
My mom had a plastic one
in the bathroom.

240
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:41,979
It was a lamp.

241
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,773
Good to see you, Theo.

242
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:52,072
We got to keep
Las Meninas and a few other Velásquezes,

243
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,607
but we only got a hold of two Goyas.

244
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,776
That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.

245
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,278
Not to mention people.

246
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,738
How's Martha?

247
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,375
She's doing her animal charity thing.
Sends her love.

248
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,503
- Give her my best.
- Yes.

249
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,759
Why did you come, Theo?

250
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,932
Well, the thing is,

251
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,759
I met this girl.

252
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,185
Cute?

253
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,720
Beautiful.

254
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,355
Is it serious?

255
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,066
Very.

256
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,270
She's got this brother in Brighton and
she hasn't seen him for about five years,

257
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,406
and he's not doing too good.

258
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:37,992
I mean, pretty sick.

259
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,195
I don't think he's gonna make it.

260
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,580
Sorry.

261
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,251
I've got money.
I was just hoping that you might...

262
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:02,717
I was hoping you could get us
the transit papers to get to the coast.

263
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:05,345
Transit papers?
That's quite a favor.

264
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:06,596
I know.

265
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,606
Highly controlled.

266
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,778
Alex, take your pills.

267
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,115
Alex.

268
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,741
Alex?

269
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,118
Alex!

270
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,717
Come with me.

271
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,548
I'm really sorry, Nigel.
I just don't know who else to ask.

272
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,476
I'll see what I can do.

273
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,637
What?

274
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,273
You kill me.

275
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,517
A hundred years from now,

276
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,653
there won't be one sad fuck
to look at any of this.

277
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,490
What keeps you going?

278
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,192
You know what it is, Theo?

279
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,662
I just don't think about it.

280
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,078
Where's Julian?

281
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,340
She couldn't make it.
Sends her best.

282
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,126
Here's a photo of the girl and her name.

283
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,680
Hang on. We got a problem.

284
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,174
All I could get were joint transit papers,

285
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,685
which means I would have to escort the girl.

286
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,520
Will you?

287
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,191
For a couple more grand.

288
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,810
Julian thinks very highly of you.

289
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,364
Does she?

290
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,365
Yeah.

291
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:42,534
Thanks again.

292
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,383
Go on, stay with her.

293
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:10,604
Stay with her.
Stay with her. Yes!

294
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:14,566
Have you seen this dog?

295
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,288
I'll be one minute.

296
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,951
Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.

297
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,286
Okay, Theo.
He'll see to you. He'll see to you.

298
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,881
I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on.

299
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,342
That's 70 quid.

300
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,942
Shit.

301
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,482
<i>She's my house cleaner.</i>

302
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:06,817
<i>He's the plumber.</i>

303
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:07,861
Jesus.

304
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:08,987
<i>He's my dentist.</i>

305
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,070
<i>He's the waiter.</i>

306
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:11,957
<i>She's my cousin.</i>

307
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,409
<i>They are illegal immigrants.</i>

308
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,871
<i>To hire, feed or shelter
illegal immigrants is a crime.</i>

309
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:18,997
<i>Protect Britain.</i>

310
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,832
<i>Report all illegal immigrants.</i>

311
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,416
Did you get the papers?

312
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,678
Lovely to see you, too.

313
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:27,765
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

314
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,717
Just like the old days,
back of the bus.

315
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:33,344
Yeah, except we're the old farts now.

316
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,887
- You're looking good.
- Right.

317
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,066
Seriously. Look at me.

318
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:41,944
It's hard for me to look at you.

319
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,573
He had your eyes.

320
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:55,032
You know, I never understood
how you got over it so quickly.

321
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,326
You think I got over it?

322
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,661
No one could get over it.
I live with it. I think about him every day.

323
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:00,038
Come on, I mean the way you just...

324
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,039
You don't have a monopoly
on suffering, you know.

325
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,583
You always carried his memory
like a ball and chain...

326
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,917
What do you fucking know
about my memories?

327
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,711
- You don't know what I feel or what...
- Move!

328
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,878
Yeah, there you go.

329
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,891
That's what you always do.
When it gets tough, you walk away.

330
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,477
This is our stop.

331
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,699
Thelonius!

332
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,000
So why did you come to me?

333
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,078
You could have found
other ways to get transit papers.

334
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,454
Probably.

335
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:43,664
So why me?

336
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,092
I trust you.

337
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,794
And what happens after?

338
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,796
You take a train back. It'll be safer.

339
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:52,391
No, I mean what happens to us?

340
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,768
I don't know.

341
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,275
Theo, come on.
You came for the money.

342
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:02,776
Did I?

343
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,039
Theo?

344
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,501
- You got my money?
- See?

345
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,079
We'll take you down to the first checkpoint
on the Canterbury Road,

346
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,465
then you and Kee are on your own.

347
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,797
Well, this is obviously the elite unit.

348
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,214
- This is Miriam.
- Hi.

349
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:35,424
Is this the girl?

350
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:37,853
Kee, this is Theo.

351
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,722
What the fuck you staring at?

352
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,142
Apparently the pleasure's all mine.

353
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,987
Are we planning a sing-along?

354
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,824
Good. I'm gonna take a nap.

355
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:02,993
<i>The afternoon is looking
good here on Radio Avalon.</i>

356
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,538
<i>And now one for all
the nostalgics out there,</i>

357
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:08,833
<i>a blast from the past
all the way back from 2003.</i>

358
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,669
<i>That beautiful time
when people refused to accept</i>

359
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,922
<i>the future was just around the corner.</i>

360
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,557
Hey

361
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:18,477
You're snoring.

362
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,844
No, I wasn't.

363
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,180
Yes, you were. He always snored.

364
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,807
Where are we?

365
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:28,653
Canterbury. We're close.

366
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:32,406
Anyone know if there's a hotel around here?

367
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,242
What?

368
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,402
Julian promised me
a little bit of action.

369
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,038
You still like it in the afternoon?

370
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:43,660
So what did you do?
Rob a train? Blow up a building?

371
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:45,503
Leave the girl alone.

372
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:48,580
You told me he was suave.
Wanker's a drunk.

373
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:52,460
He's suave. You should have seen him
in the old days when he was a real activist.

374
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:54,836
You were the activist,
I just wanted to get laid.

375
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:57,589
One time the police came
to throw us out of our squat

376
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,050
and Theo invited them up
for coffee to negotiate,

377
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,179
only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.

378
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,982
No! You didn't, did you?

379
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,559
Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.

380
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,144
You know how many people
I've tried this with?

381
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:12,230
I don't wanna know.

382
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,522
You'll be happy to know
out of the hundreds...

383
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:15,148
- Hundreds?
- ...you are still the only one.

384
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,401
- I'm not doing it.
- Yes, you are.

385
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,069
- No, I'm not. The car's moving too much.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

386
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,830
You are. Ready?

387
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,835
Thelonius!

388
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:27,837
No, wait, wait. Okay.

389
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:32,425
Do it again!
Do it again!

390
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,846
Julian, that's disgusting!

391
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,799
Look out!

392
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,343
Jesus! Shit!

393
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,761
Go! Go! We're gonna make it.
Come on, we're gonna make it.

394
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:48,107
No, I'm not gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it!

395
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:51,644
- Christ!
- Back up! Back up now!

396
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:53,279
Jesus!

397
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:01,445
Oh, save us! Save us
in our hour of need!

398
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,624
Blessed Mary, save us.

399
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,837
Christ, Jesus!

400
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,548
- He's got a gun!
- Cover Kee!

401
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,099
Get down!

402
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,178
Oh, my God!

403
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:28,773
She's been shot!
Fuck. She's been shot.

404
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,191
How is she? How is she?

405
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:39,650
She's bleeding!

406
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,078
She's bleeding,
she's bleeding everywhere!

407
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,492
Shit! Julian.

408
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,878
Put pressure on the wound!

409
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,334
Please, please, please.

410
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,127
Please, please.

411
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,555
Oh, no.

412
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,182
Oh, no.

413
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,935
Julian...

414
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:07,813
Jesus Christ!

415
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:09,772
Julian!

416
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:12,358
It's the cops. It's the cops.

417
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:15,945
Did they see us?

418
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:17,730
Keep going. Speed up.

419
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,815
- Are they coming back?
- Faster! Faster!

420
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:19,898
What's happening?

421
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,359
- Are they coming back?
- I don't know. Just go faster!

422
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,903
Can't you pull off the road?

423
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:27,906
All right, slow down. Slow down!

424
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:29,366
I can't outrun them.
I can't outrun them.

425
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,868
<i>- Stop the car.
- I gotta stop. I gotta stop.</i>

426
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,663
<i>Pull over to the side of the road.
Stop the car!</i>

427
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,924
Get your passports out!

428
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,460
Stay inside the vehicle!

429
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,878
We're British citizens!
We're British citizens!

430
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,338
- British citizens!
- Hands on the steering wheel!

431
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,259
Hands on the steering wheel!
Calm down. Tell me what happened!

432
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,219
We were attacked!
We gotta take her to a hospital.

433
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,359
Okay. Just wait.
I'm gonna call for assistance.

434
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:54,558
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

435
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,059
- Get in the car.
- Why did you do that?

436
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,104
Get in the fucking car!

437
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,147
Get back in now. Quickly.

438
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,534
We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.

439
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:05,537
Go! Go! Go!

440
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,997
We have to call on help now.
Put your hands out.

441
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,406
Fucking shit.

442
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,618
May all the ascended beings,
the bodhisattvas and saints

443
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:59,039
and all those who have walked the surface
of the earth in the light of eternal truth,

444
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,220
come to the aid of our
beloved sister, Julian.

445
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,459
Theo! Come on!

446
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:49,641
Theo, come on!

447
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,719
This is Tomasz and Emily's farm.

448
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,188
I already called
and told them the situation.

449
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,023
We'll be safe here.

450
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:46,197
Fishes are coming in
to vote for a new leader.

451
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,662
- Ian?
- Yeah.

452
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:54,947
- We have to convene.
- Everyone's arriving.

453
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:57,199
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's not my blood.

454
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,661
- Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee.
- Welcome.

455
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:01,912
Miriam.

456
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,913
They need to wash up and rest.

457
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,790
How about Julian's mate?

458
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:09,086
Yeah, can somebody give me
a lift back to London?

459
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,048
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous. We'll sort it tomorrow.

460
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:14,174
Tomasz, get him a shower
and a clean shirt.

461
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:15,468
Tomasz, don't block the car in.

462
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:16,719
It needs to be jump-started. Ian?

463
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,020
Yeah.

464
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,848
They like you.
And they don't like anyone.

465
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,126
You did what you could.

466
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,545
We need to show strength and unity.

467
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,755
The shirt fit?

468
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:54,507
Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

469
00:33:54,508 --> 00:33:56,133
I'll take care of this.

470
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,551
As head Fishes,
we need to make a choice now.

471
00:33:58,552 --> 00:33:59,845
We need to choose leadership.

472
00:33:59,846 --> 00:34:03,148
I don't think
that those bloodstains will wash off.

473
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,068
Don't worry about it.
Throw it away.

474
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:14,443
I'm in charge of watching you.

475
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,869
Why?

476
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:17,789
They told me.

477
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:19,998
Well, I'm going back
to London tomorrow.

478
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,878
I lived there once. Didn't like it.

479
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,340
No.

480
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,291
They kill you.

481
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,333
Where you from?

482
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,635
Poland.

483
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:33,795
Is this your place?

484
00:34:33,797 --> 00:34:36,557
My missus. She's a cod.

485
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,800
English Fish.

486
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,144
Mr. Faron.

487
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,262
Kee would like a word with you.

488
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:44,983
She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

489
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,900
I'll watch him.

490
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,492
Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

491
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,572
To Luke,
our new leader. Luke.

492
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:02,074
- To Luke.
- Luke.

493
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,012
I'll be right outside.

494
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,342
You know what they do to these cows?

495
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:22,802
They cut off their tits. They do.

496
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,898
Gone. Bye.

497
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:29,443
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

498
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:33,864
It's wacko. Why not make machines
that suck eight titties?

499
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:37,693
Is that what you want to talk about?
Cows and titties?

500
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:39,954
Julian told me about your baby.

501
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,998
Said his name was Dylan.

502
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:46,543
You taught him to swim when he was two.
He called you "Papa."

503
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:50,206
She said if anything goes spooky,
I should talk to you.

504
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:53,250
Said you'd help me,
said you'd get me to the boat.

505
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,210
<i>- What boat?
- The Tomorrow.</i>

506
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,721
<i>The Tomorrow?</i>

507
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,672
I don't know what you're talking about.

508
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:01,842
But I'm sure your friends
can take care of you.

509
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:04,228
But Julian said only trust you.

510
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,179
She said you'd help me.

511
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,483
I don't know why she said that.

512
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,559
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

513
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:12,644
You can't leave.

514
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,103
Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

515
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,782
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

516
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:19,661
What are you doing? Don't do that.

517
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,514
I'm scared.

518
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,813
Please help me.

519
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:54,769
Jesus Christ.

520
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:57,614
- Keel Kee!
- What are you doing?

521
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,400
Are you all right?

522
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:02,954
She wanted him to know.
She has the right.

523
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,280
Of course she has.

524
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,489
For God's sake.

525
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,326
When you're ready, come inside.
Everybody's arrived.

526
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,911
She's pregnant.

527
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,838
Now you know what's at stake.

528
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,835
But she's pregnant.

529
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,429
Yeah, I know.

530
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,806
It's a miracle, isn't it?

531
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,764
<i>Fishes terrorist leader
Julian Taylor was killed today</i>

532
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,518
<i>in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.</i>

533
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,655
<i>Four other terrorists escaped
after murdering two officers.</i>

534
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,525
<i>Police say they have sufficient
forensic and surveillance evidence</i>

535
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,445
<i>to identify the four killers.</i>

536
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:48,750
<i>All suspects should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

537
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:51,702
This was broadcast an hour ago.

538
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,704
We have to assume
it's just a matter of time

539
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,581
before they identify the rest of us,

540
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,748
which includes you, Theo.

541
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,333
- Why is he here?
- He's not a Fish.

542
00:37:58,335 --> 00:37:59,376
He's not one of us.

543
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,543
I want him here.

544
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,463
Kee wants him, he stays.

545
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:06,050
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

546
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,092
Right.

547
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,385
Now we got to reevaluate that position.

548
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:11,722
No, there's no need.
We move forward with the original plan.

549
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,847
Yes!

550
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,099
She'll never make it.
The police are looking for her.

551
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:17,561
We can find a way.
It's what Julian wanted.

552
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,063
We'd be risking the girl's life.

553
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,606
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

554
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,775
And this baby is the flag
that could unite us all!

555
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:26,235
We said we'd never use
this baby for political purposes.

556
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,528
My baby's not a flag.

557
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,373
Make it public!

558
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,791
WOMAN; What?

559
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,034
- What?
- What?

560
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:33,378
Excuse me?

561
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,547
You should make it public.

562
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:39,666
You saw the telly.
She's about to be very public.

563
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:42,043
It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

564
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,463
Oh, right. And then
the government will say,

565
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,965
"We were wrong.
Fugees are humans, too."

566
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,175
Well, whatever is going on,

567
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,385
whatever your political ideas are,
it's irrelevant.

568
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:51,844
- It doesn't matter.
- Come on.

569
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,764
- She needs a doctor.
- You really don't get it.

570
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,932
Look, the government
will take her baby

571
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,018
and parade a posh black
English lady as the mother.

572
00:38:58,018 --> 00:38:59,894
- And she'll never see it again.
- Nobody's taking my baby!

573
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:02,146
We all know this government
would never acknowledge

574
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:04,233
the first human birth
in 18 years from a fugee.

575
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,442
A wanted fugee.

576
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,612
Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron
what they do to immigrants in this country?

577
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,699
He knows.
He's seen the cages. He's not that stupid.

578
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,324
I'm not going to the government.

579
00:39:13,326 --> 00:39:15,411
You told me you would
get me to the Human Project.

580
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:16,994
- You promised me.
- I know.

581
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:18,715
And we will.

582
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,094
But I don't think it's safe to
try and reach the coast now.

583
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:28,099
You could stay here, Kee. It's a safe
place for you to have your child.

584
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:29,800
And when you and the baby are well enough,

585
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,135
we will find a way to
get you to the Human Project.

586
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,177
I promise you, Kee.

587
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,733
It could take months
to get back in touch with them again.

588
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,061
This is true.
We have to take it under consideration.

589
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:44,614
Kee, this is your decision.

590
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:48,536
What do you think?

591
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:51,905
I think you need proper care.

592
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,030
Oh, brilliant!

593
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,657
She has proper care!

594
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,461
- What the fuck does he know?
- Hang on. Kee?

595
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,213
Kee, this is your choice.

596
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:04,835
- I have my baby here...
- Yes!

597
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,378
...then you get me
to the Human Project.

598
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,681
Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

599
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,507
We need to organize safe houses.

600
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:11,925
No more than three days in one place.

601
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,802
No, no, you can't
keep moving her around.

602
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,396
It's for her safety.

603
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:37,701
Please help him!

604
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:38,869
What are you doing?

605
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,871
- He's hurt really badly!
- Oh, shit, fuck.

606
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,079
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

607
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,206
You're not supposed to be here!

608
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,373
There's fucking
police everywhere!

609
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,876
- What do you think you're doing?
- He's been bleeding for hours!

610
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,514
Shut up! Get his bike
out of here. Get it out!

611
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:04,061
What was I supposed to do?

612
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,271
It's a simple fucking plan.
Get in here, Patric!

613
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:09,233
What the fuck are you doing here?

614
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,900
What the fuck are you doing here?

615
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:11,985
No fucking excuses!

616
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:13,402
You have a first aid kit? Medicine?

617
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:14,780
Mostly for cows.

618
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,405
Iodine, bandages, clean towels,

619
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,865
whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

620
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,659
And for God's sake,
hide the fucking motorcycle.

621
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,911
You put everything at risk.

622
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,161
What was I supposed to do?

623
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:26,625
What about all the fucking police, Ian?
You said it would be safe!

624
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:30,471
We paid the gang.
We had no idea about the cops.

625
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,846
You broke the protocol.
What were you thinking?

626
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:40,264
What was I thinking?

627
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,641
You could be responsible
for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

628
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:44,016
He needs a proper doctor!

629
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,561
Don't you get it?

630
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:46,769
We have a baby.

631
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:50,190
When people see we have a baby,
everyone will join us in the Uprising.

632
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,610
But we can forget about the baby
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

633
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,027
What was I supposed to do?

634
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:57,947
You saw how he is.
He's on death's fucking door!

635
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,240
- Take it easy.
- You broke protocol.

636
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:01,168
He's my fucking cousin!

637
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,621
Luke, he needs a doctor.

638
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,000
Don't worry.
We'll take care of him. Simon, right?

639
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,126
Aye, Simon.

640
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,635
All right, sit down, Patric.

641
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,797
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

642
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:17,425
Be proud to know that because of
the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

643
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:19,853
The baby will stay with us.

644
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:24,016
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

645
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:26,851
No. Tomorrow.
We'll do him then, after we move the girl.

646
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:31,699
Patric, you ever break protocol again,

647
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,869
I'll have to kill you.

648
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:49,166
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

649
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,876
- Listen to me.
- What's going on?

650
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:55,347
Luke killed Julian.
They want your baby. They killed Julian.

651
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:57,965
They're gonna...
They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

652
00:42:57,967 --> 00:42:59,760
We have to leave. We have to go now.

653
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,510
Miriam, shut up!

654
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,856
Trust me, we've got to go.

655
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,483
Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

656
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:08,018
Get off!

657
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,947
I'm going with him.
Miriam, you can stay if you want.

658
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,443
Miriam, you have to
keep your mouth shut.

659
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,829
- I mean it.
- All right. All right.

660
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:43,311
We're moving the girl
to Bristol straight away.

661
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:48,150
We need to bring weapons over...

662
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,820
The refugee camps...

663
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,403
Zaphyr,
he looks bloody fucking awful.

664
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:01,530
Yeah. Really?

665
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,032
All that dirt and sand in there,
nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

666
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:05,574
Shit! It's fucking disgusting.

667
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,827
He's not gonna make it.

668
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:10,797
Of course not gonna make it,
with all the blood and guts coming out.

669
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,001
Hey, Samir.

670
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,590
Shit.

671
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,637
Stop! Stop the car!
Stop the fucking car!

672
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:09,514
Don't shoot!

673
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:12,601
Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

674
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:14,603
- Stop!
- The girl's in the car!

675
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:17,438
Stop the fucking car!
Give me the fucking keys.

676
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,574
Give me the fucking keys.

677
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,994
Get down! Get down!

678
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:25,572
Can't you get it moving any faster?
For God's sake!

679
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:27,114
Come on. Come on.

680
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:29,034
Stop!

681
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:30,659
Stop!

682
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,253
Shit.

683
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:35,298
They're coming!
They're coming!

684
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,802
Get going, get going!
They're getting closer!

685
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,768
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

686
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,646
Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

687
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:51,523
Fuck Off!

688
00:46:02,902 --> 00:46:04,902
Miriam, jump-start the car!

689
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:06,539
We have to go!

690
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,746
Wait till it gets faster!

691
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:17,550
All right! All right!
Just push, you push!

692
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:26,766
Fucking hell!

693
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:30,219
Miriam! Miriam!

694
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,940
We have to wait for him! Theo!

695
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:36,485
Go, go, go!

696
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:47,945
Kee, are you all right?

697
00:46:47,947 --> 00:46:49,155
I'm fine.

698
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:51,407
We need to find a safe house.

699
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,242
Yeah, the last one
was really fucking safe.

700
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,786
Well, what do you suggest?

701
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:57,547
Don't worry. I know where to go.

702
00:47:22,648 --> 00:47:24,324
Wait here.

703
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,871
Oh, fuck.

704
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,641
Fuck.

705
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:54,771
Jasper?

706
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:56,940
Janice?

707
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,458
Jasper?

708
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:21,456
Oh, fuck!

709
00:48:21,456 --> 00:48:23,132
Oh, fuck you.

710
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,876
What are you doing with this shit?

711
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:30,474
This? I mix it with bread
to poison the rats.

712
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,842
It's not bullshit what they say.

713
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,853
They pass away quite peacefully.

714
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,313
Jasper.

715
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,275
Meet Miriam and Kee.

716
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:53,905
<i>The Tomorrow is
a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat.</i>

717
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,532
They'll take us to the Human Project.

718
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,784
I told you, amigo,
the Human Project is real.

719
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:01,246
Yeah, but you're also the guy
that believes in UFOs.

720
00:49:01,246 --> 00:49:04,039
Tell them about that thing
you saw on the heath.

721
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,675
You saw a UFO?

722
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:09,586
Did you know that the Human Project

723
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:11,755
is supposed to have
a community on the Azores?

724
00:49:11,757 --> 00:49:14,717
It's a sanctuary.
That's where they'll take us, Kee.

725
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,635
Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

726
00:49:16,637 --> 00:49:21,525
It's going to stop at the last two
weather buoys en route at sunset.

727
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:25,769
So it will be tonight at Windsmore
and then two night's time at Bexhill.

728
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:27,981
You can forget about Windsmore.
We'd never make it in time.

729
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,983
No, it's our only chance.
We can't get to Bexhill.

730
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:31,400
That's a refugee camp.

731
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:33,402
Eureka! Eat and rest.

732
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:37,206
With a little bit of luck,
you're going to need all your energy.

733
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:38,490
Where are you going?

734
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,210
Feed her for me, Theo.

735
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,913
Kee, your baby is the miracle

736
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,333
the whole world
has been waiting for.

737
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,916
<i>Shantih, shantih, shantih.</i>

738
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,461
Come on. Come on.

739
00:49:50,463 --> 00:49:52,597
<i>Shantih, shantih, shantih.</i>

740
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:55,224
Did he really see a UFO?

741
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:39,478
Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

742
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:43,264
She's doing something.

743
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:47,068
She smited me with that.
Said it was good for my baby.

744
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:51,572
Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

745
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,405
Earnest.

746
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,125
Yeah.

747
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:04,411
How many months?

748
00:51:04,411 --> 00:51:05,786
Eight.

749
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:07,664
It takes nine months.

750
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,132
I know.

751
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,635
Who's the father?

752
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,255
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

753
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,889
Sorry?

754
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:22,846
That'd be wicked, eh?

755
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,264
Yeah, it would.

756
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:28,068
Fuck knows. I don't know
most of the wankers' names.

757
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:32,355
You know, when I started puking,
I thought I catch the pest.

758
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:34,949
But then my belly started getting big.

759
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,485
Nobody ever told me these things.

760
00:51:38,487 --> 00:51:40,697
I never seen a pregnant woman before.

761
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,331
But I knew.

762
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,001
I felt like a freak.

763
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,170
I didn't tell nobody.

764
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:52,842
I thought about the Quietus thing.
Supposed to be suave.

765
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,012
Pretty music and all that.

766
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,682
Then the baby kicked.

767
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:04,813
I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
And I feel it. And me, too.

768
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:06,731
I am alive.

769
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:13,146
Froley.

770
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:14,697
Froley.

771
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:18,159
Name my baby Froley.

772
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,829
It's the first baby in 18 years.

773
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:24,407
- You can't call it Froley.
- Says who?

774
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,742
Kee, I've found you a boat.

775
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:27,911
- Great.
- How?

776
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,244
We get ourselves arrested.

777
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,288
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, no.

778
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:34,416
Syd, this border guard I sell pot to,
has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

779
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:37,721
Nicely ironic, eh?
We break into prison!

780
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,974
Wicked.

781
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,969
"Froley."

782
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:21,306
Come on.

783
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,317
Everything is
a mythical cosmic battle

784
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:35,820
between faith and chance.

785
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:37,521
Maybe I shouldn't.

786
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:40,117
You already did.
Take another one.

787
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,652
Now cough.

788
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,282
What do you taste?

789
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:48,657
Strawberries.

790
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,952
Strawberries?
That's what it's called. Strawberry Cough.

791
00:53:53,038 --> 00:53:54,163
Wicked.

792
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:58,543
So, you've got faith over here, right,
and chance over there.

793
00:53:58,543 --> 00:54:00,711
- Like yin and yang.
- Sort of.

794
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:02,505
Or Shiva and Shakti.

795
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,849
Lennon and McCartney.

796
00:54:04,717 --> 00:54:06,384
Look, Julian and Theo.

797
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:07,635
Yeah, there you go.

798
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,847
Julian and Theo met among
a million protestors in a rally

799
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,181
by chance.

800
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:14,976
But they were there
because of what they believed in

801
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:16,728
in the first place, their faith.

802
00:54:16,728 --> 00:54:18,688
They wanted to change the world.

803
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,657
And their faith kept them together.

804
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:25,329
But by chance, Dylan was born.

805
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,996
This is him?

806
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,835
Yeah, that's him. He would have been
about your age. Magical child.

807
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,170
Beautiful.

808
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,289
- Their faith put in praxis.
- Praxis?

809
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,416
What happened?

810
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:39,760
Chance.

811
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,878
He was their sweet little dream.

812
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:45,514
He had little hands,
little legs, little feet.

813
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,851
Little lungs.

814
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,856
And in 2008,
along came the flu pandemic.

815
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:57,860
And then, by chance,

816
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,436
he was gone.

817
00:54:59,438 --> 00:55:00,864
Oh, Jesus.

818
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,369
You see, Theo's faith

819
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,204
lost out to chance.

820
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,706
So,

821
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,045
why bother if life's going
to make its own choices?

822
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,956
- Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
- Yeah.

823
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:20,416
Oh, boy. That's terrible.

824
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:24,128
But, you know,
everything happens for a reason.

825
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:25,713
That I don't know.

826
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:29,351
But Theo and Julian would
always bring Dylan. He loved it here.

827
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,909
It's the alarm!
Someone's breaking in!

828
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,527
What is it?

829
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:49,079
Look at this.

830
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,750
Shit.

831
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:03,677
Jasper, hurry up!

832
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,213
Where's Janice?

833
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:10,675
Take the back path to the main road,
then follow the map I've given Miriam.

834
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:11,967
- Yeah, I've got it.
- What are you talking about?

835
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,521
Wait for Syd at the old school
on Watchbell Road in Rye.

836
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,639
Give him this, and tell him
he's a fascist pig.

837
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:18,974
We need to get Janice.

838
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,693
We're not going, Theo.

839
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,311
What are you talking about?

840
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,896
You don't need an anchor.

841
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,148
No, Jasper. You're coming.

842
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,650
You need time. We'll stall them.

843
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,485
I'll send them the wrong way.
It's the best idea. Go on. Go on.

844
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:31,954
Jasper.

845
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:36,367
Theo, I've talked my way out of
worse things than this. Believe me.

846
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:38,335
Go on. Go.

847
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:44,467
And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig.

848
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,719
I love you.

849
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:19,896
Hey, amigos!

850
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:22,681
We're looking for Theo Faron.

851
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:25,393
We know he was here
a few weeks ago. Has he been back?

852
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:27,228
- Who?
- Theo Faron.

853
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:28,896
I haven't seen him in weeks.

854
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:31,648
There's biscuits and coffee on inside!
Help yourself.

855
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:35,829
You want a drag?
Come on, have a drag. Lighten up.

856
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:38,748
- What we got?
- Here, Luke.

857
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,909
There's a dead woman and dog inside.

858
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:43,920
They're going to Bexhill.

859
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,422
When did they leave?

860
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:49,759
When did they leave?

861
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:54,054
Pull my finger, go on.

862
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,931
Pull my finger.

863
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,268
I'll do it.

864
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:06,349
Fuck you.

865
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,121
Pull my finger.

866
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,621
Theo, I'm so sorry.

867
00:59:26,621 --> 00:59:28,632
Don't you fucking touch me.

868
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,708
You tell me the fucking reason in that.

869
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,336
- It's all part of a bigger thing.
- Shut up!

870
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,847
Shut up and get in the fucking car.

871
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:38,048
Jasper?

872
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,476
He's fine.

873
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,021
Everything's fine.

874
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:52,057
I was 31.
Midwife at the John Radcliffe.

875
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:54,943
I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.

876
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:59,114
Three of my patients miscarried in one week.

877
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:02,108
Others were in their fifth and sixth month.

878
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,788
We managed to save
two of the poor babies.

879
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:08,291
Next week, five more miscarried.

880
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:11,628
Then the miscarriages
started happening earlier.

881
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:15,371
I remember booking a woman
in for her next appointment

882
01:02:15,373 --> 01:02:19,168
and noticing that the page
seven months ahead was completely blank.

883
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,844
Not a single name.

884
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,422
I rang a friend
who was working at Queen Charlotte's,

885
01:02:24,423 --> 01:02:27,226
and she had no new pregnancies, either.

886
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,648
She then rang her sister in Sydney.

887
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,775
And it was the same thing there.

888
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,949
You can relax. She's finished.

889
01:02:44,985 --> 01:02:47,956
As the sound of the playgrounds faded,

890
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:50,791
the despair set in.

891
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:59,634
Very odd what happens
in a world without children's voices.

892
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,847
I was there at the end.

893
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,184
Now you're gonna be
there at the beginning.

894
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:09,978
Yeah.

895
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:12,605
I'll be there at the beginning.

896
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,056
Thank you.

897
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:22,114
Kee, come on! We've got to go!

898
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:34,460
<i>Stop where you are.</i>

899
01:03:34,494 --> 01:03:36,795
I'm looking for Syd.

900
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,425
<i>Hands above your head.</i>

901
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:45,054
You're a fascist pig.

902
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,110
What did you say?

903
01:04:00,978 --> 01:04:03,864
I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.

904
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:07,943
Say it again.

905
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:09,454
No, don't, please!

906
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:11,581
Say it again.

907
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,750
Say it!

908
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,585
You're a fascist pig.

909
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,596
Come on.

910
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:38,650
It was Jasper's idea, you know.
The whole password thing.

911
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:42,653
He will piss himself laughing
when I tell him about this.

912
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,489
He's a cheeky old bastard.

913
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,951
So proud of his weed.

914
01:04:48,068 --> 01:04:50,277
Syd could get it a lot
cheaper from the gangs,

915
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:52,956
but Syd likes to deal with Jasper.

916
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,115
Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.

917
01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:58,661
All right.

918
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,954
What's wrong with her? Is she sick?

919
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:01,755
Just carsick.

920
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,916
- She's not going to puke, is she?
- No. She's fine.

921
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,219
Puking's bad. Very, very bad.

922
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,472
It doesn't wash out.
The smell never goes away.

923
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:14,726
Usually, there's people trying
to get out of Bexhill, not in.

924
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:18,815
Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.

925
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,525
Syd doesn't want to know.

926
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,570
Syd doesn't care.

927
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,690
Just breathe. Just breathe.

928
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,025
What's wrong with her?

929
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:33,036
A minor contraction.
It's normal. Just breathe.

930
01:05:33,697 --> 01:05:34,989
All right.

931
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:37,365
When you're released,
stroll out with the other fugees.

932
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,117
Look for the statue of a soldier.

933
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,871
There you'll meet a woman,
Marichka. Arab, gypsy, something.

934
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:44,998
Always carries a shitty little dog with her.

935
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,376
She'll find you accommodation for tonight.

936
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,179
All right. You're fugees now.

937
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,181
Show Syd the fugee face.

938
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,882
Sad face.

939
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,853
Sad fugee face.

940
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,637
That's good. That's good.

941
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:02,190
Okay. Out!

942
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,697
Come on. Come on. Come on.

943
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,288
Hurry up. Hurry up, move.

944
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:33,088
Send me a postcard.

945
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,557
Seats in the back!
Come on, hurry up!

946
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,389
What time are we supposed
to meet the boat?

947
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:25,056
Sunset tomorrow.

948
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:28,527
How do we know that Luke
and his mob haven't intercepted it?

949
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:33,282
Luke has no way of contacting
the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.

950
01:07:35,902 --> 01:07:37,744
Say again?

951
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:41,824
Contact with the Human Project
is done by mirrors.

952
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,659
Julian was our mirror.

953
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,588
What do you mean, "mirrors"?

954
01:07:48,456 --> 01:07:51,500
Mirrors. They contact one of our people.

955
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:55,128
That person contacts someone else,
and so on, till word gets to Julian.

956
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,380
She tells Luke.

957
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,713
You mean you never actually
talked to any of them?

958
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:58,840
Uh-uh.

959
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,300
Don't fucking tell me
you never actually talked to them?

960
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:02,427
All right.

961
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:05,264
- Breathe it out.
- Is she okay?

962
01:08:05,264 --> 01:08:07,733
That's it. Breathe it out,
breathe it out.

963
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:10,737
I can't fucking breathe.

964
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,072
You sure this is normal?

965
01:08:13,106 --> 01:08:15,574
It shouldn't be this frequent.

966
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:18,493
Come on, breathe it out.
All right, all right.

967
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,064
Miriam,

968
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:48,899
I'm all wet.

969
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:51,435
Her water's broke. The baby's coming.

970
01:08:51,435 --> 01:08:53,395
Shit. Shit!

971
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:57,815
All right, sweetheart. All right,
sweetheart. Everything is fine. Breathe.

972
01:08:57,817 --> 01:08:59,734
Just breathe it out. That's it.

973
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,238
Tomorrow you'll be safe.
You'll be on the boat.

974
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:05,823
<i>On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you.</i>

975
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:08,284
They'll take you far away from all this.

976
01:09:18,546 --> 01:09:21,506
Look up, you piece of shite. Look up.

977
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:24,051
Out!

978
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:25,176
Get out!

979
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:28,639
Lord, give Kee the strength to know that
she has the power already within her.

980
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,349
- She has the wisdom...
- What's wrong with you?

981
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,309
I said, what's wrong with you?

982
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,185
Look at me!
I said, what's wrong with you?

983
01:09:34,186 --> 01:09:35,270
Saint Gabriel, help us...

984
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,655
Shut up!

985
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:38,148
You! Out!

986
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:39,440
Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!

987
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,528
Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!

988
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,738
- Up, now. Come on.
- Caca! Caca!

989
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:48,283
Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.

990
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:52,721
You smell it yourself.
You fucking people disgust me.

991
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:06,092
She's okay, Kee. She's okay.

992
01:10:06,094 --> 01:10:08,104
- She's gonna be...
- Miriam!

993
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,747
Move it! Come along now!

994
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:35,872
Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!

995
01:10:35,872 --> 01:10:38,875
Get down there. Down there. Move.

996
01:10:38,876 --> 01:10:40,636
Follow the line!

997
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,507
- Theo!
- Keel

998
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,769
- Take it off!
- Theo!

999
01:10:53,224 --> 01:10:56,143
Come on, move!
Move it! Come on!

1000
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:58,185
Move it! Move it!

1001
01:10:58,186 --> 01:11:00,521
Come on! Move! Move!

1002
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:03,692
<i>Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.</i>

1003
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,162
<i>Do not support terrorists.</i>

1004
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:09,113
<i>Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.</i>

1005
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:11,792
<i>Do not support terrorists.</i>

1006
01:11:17,832 --> 01:11:20,751
Hey you, buddy!
Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!

1007
01:11:20,752 --> 01:11:24,212
You want accommodations?
I got running water! I got...

1008
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:25,713
Just leave the girl alone.

1009
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:28,382
- Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
- Fuck off.

1010
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,092
- Who do you fucking think you are?
- Fuck off.

1011
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:32,095
Don't mind these bastards.
I'll take care of you.

1012
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,597
Come on, I've got a room,
food, a place to stay. What do you need?

1013
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:36,099
- I'm fine, thanks.
- You must need something, man.

1014
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,194
"Fuck off," is it? Bollocks.

1015
01:11:49,613 --> 01:11:51,247
Marichka?

1016
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,211
It's okay, Kee.

1017
01:12:04,212 --> 01:12:07,640
Just breathe through it.

1018
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:12,228
That's it. It's okay.
We're almost there, Kee.

1019
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:14,814
We're almost there.

1020
01:12:27,859 --> 01:12:29,653
It's just a few stairs.

1021
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:32,998
Just hold onto me.

1022
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:36,002
I've got you.

1023
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:38,421
Just keep breathing.

1024
01:12:39,204 --> 01:12:41,673
Marichka? How far?

1025
01:12:41,873 --> 01:12:43,509
How far?

1026
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:46,679
We're almost there, Kee.
Almost there.

1027
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,849
You're doing great. Come on.

1028
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:55,145
You're almost there. Three more steps.

1029
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:06,990
We're there, Kee. We're there.

1030
01:13:16,451 --> 01:13:19,753
Okay, there's a bed. Easy.

1031
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:23,631
Make her go! Make her go!

1032
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,970
That's great. Thank you.

1033
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,881
Get her out!

1034
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:32,850
Get her out!

1035
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,108
Thank you.

1036
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,863
Okay, Kee.

1037
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,501
I'm going to put my coat underneath.
You'll be cleaner.

1038
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,172
You're okay.

1039
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,125
Okay?

1040
01:14:07,126 --> 01:14:10,095
There's water.
I'm just going to wash my hands.

1041
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,591
Theo! Theo!

1042
01:14:15,592 --> 01:14:17,770
I'm here. Fuck!

1043
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,764
It's okay. Everything's okay.

1044
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:22,690
Do something!

1045
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:30,198
It's looking good, Kee.
It's looking good.

1046
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:33,443
You're doing great.
Just keep breathing.

1047
01:14:33,444 --> 01:14:35,654
- Keep breathing.
- I am breathing!

1048
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:37,697
No, like Miriam said.
Do you remember?

1049
01:14:37,698 --> 01:14:40,333
Breathe out.
Just think about the out.

1050
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:45,046
Breathe out and push. Push as well.

1051
01:14:45,372 --> 01:14:48,082
- That's it. That's it!
- I can't!

1052
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,427
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can. Just out and push.

1053
01:14:51,462 --> 01:14:53,430
Out and push.

1054
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:56,925
- That's it!
- I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please.

1055
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:59,770
Kee, I can see the head.
I can see the head.

1056
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,389
You're doing great.
You're doing great, Kee.

1057
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,859
That's it. That's it.

1058
01:15:05,225 --> 01:15:10,221
It's coming again.
Just breathe out and push. Out and push.

1059
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:12,439
- That's it. Out and...
- I can't.

1060
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,693
- You can. Yes, you can.
- I fucking can't!

1061
01:15:14,694 --> 01:15:16,862
- Yes, you fucking can! Come on!
- I can't do it.

1062
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,997
Kee, the head's coming out.

1063
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,739
That's it, you're nearly there!

1064
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:23,368
You're nearly there. Just push!

1065
01:15:23,368 --> 01:15:25,996
Push, Kee! Push!

1066
01:15:25,997 --> 01:15:27,631
Push!

1067
01:15:35,715 --> 01:15:36,797
Oh, my God.

1068
01:15:39,217 --> 01:15:40,978
How is he?

1069
01:15:41,845 --> 01:15:43,646
It's a girl.

1070
01:15:45,181 --> 01:15:47,818
Kee, you've got a girl.

1071
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:56,827
Hey, baba.

1072
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:06,036
Aren't we supposed
to cut the cord?

1073
01:16:06,037 --> 01:16:08,255
Yeah, it's okay.
There's no rush.

1074
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:11,425
You've done it.

1075
01:16:12,877 --> 01:16:14,470
Kee,

1076
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,971
see?

1077
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:19,600
It wasn't that bad.

1078
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,560
Oh, yeah, not for you.

1079
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:42,664
Come on! Hurry up!
We don't have much time!

1080
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,000
Who is it?

1081
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:48,671
The King of England.
Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd.

1082
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:57,845
How can you sleep through
when the whole city's going to hell?

1083
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:59,296
What's wrong with her?

1084
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:00,715
She's fine. It's a woman's thing.

1085
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:02,884
Fuck off!

1086
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:06,887
A few hours ago, a bomb
blew a hole in the fence and fugees got out.

1087
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:08,222
But Syd happens to know,

1088
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:10,725
the hole in the fence
isn't about fugees getting out.

1089
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:12,601
- It's about Fishies getting in.
- Go away.

1090
01:17:12,603 --> 01:17:16,230
Syd also happens to know that the Army's
gonna blow the shit out of this place.

1091
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,565
But don't worry.
Syd is here to get you out.

1092
01:17:19,694 --> 01:17:20,902
Fuck off. Go away.
Go on. Piss off!

1093
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:22,612
Get your fucking dog.

1094
01:17:29,203 --> 01:17:30,787
What you got there?

1095
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:32,663
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1096
01:17:32,664 --> 01:17:34,257
- Nothing.
- No?

1097
01:17:35,376 --> 01:17:36,583
Like to show me?

1098
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,177
I don't have anything.

1099
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:43,350
- It's nothing.
- Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look.

1100
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:47,186
- It's nothing.
- Let me see.

1101
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:49,722
- No.
- Let me see.

1102
01:17:49,724 --> 01:17:51,859
It's okay. Let me see.

1103
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,903
Jesus Christ.

1104
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,573
Jesus Christ.

1105
01:17:58,189 --> 01:18:00,326
- That's a...
- That's right.

1106
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:02,744
We got a baby.

1107
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:06,280
And now we need a rowboat.
Can you help us?

1108
01:18:07,992 --> 01:18:10,076
Get her up. Get her up. We need to go.

1109
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:11,286
Can you help us get a boat?

1110
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:12,787
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up.

1111
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:14,204
We need to go. We need to go now.

1112
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,958
- What's she saying?
- Fuck knows.

1113
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,168
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1114
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,295
She doesn't want us to go.

1115
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,628
Shut up.

1116
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,101
We need to go.

1117
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:32,815
Syd was watching television
last night with Mommy.

1118
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:37,103
She's a sweet old soul.
Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking.

1119
01:18:37,104 --> 01:18:40,981
And then the news came on,
and you two were on it.

1120
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,234
Something about a cop killer.

1121
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:45,487
Something about a big reward.

1122
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,908
Syd then finds out
the Fishes are looking for you.

1123
01:18:49,908 --> 01:18:52,659
So Syd thinks,
"If the Fishes are looking for you,"

1124
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,537
"and the coppers
are looking for you,"

1125
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:57,082
"you people are
first class commodities."

1126
01:18:57,082 --> 01:19:00,051
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1127
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,637
Down, down, down!

1128
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,474
Now, Syd has a baby.

1129
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:20,905
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1130
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,658
Marichka!

1131
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,997
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

1132
01:19:33,828 --> 01:19:35,837
Bitch. You bitch.

1133
01:19:38,332 --> 01:19:39,748
Baby! Marichka baby!

1134
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,219
Quick, quick. The baby!

1135
01:19:44,337 --> 01:19:47,140
My baby! She took...

1136
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:50,685
I'll fucking kill you,
you gypsy bitch!

1137
01:19:57,685 --> 01:20:00,319
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out.

1138
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:04,565
Go, go!

1139
01:20:20,957 --> 01:20:23,426
Fuck! Shit.

1140
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,894
How are you doing?

1141
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:33,802
- How are you?
- It hurts.

1142
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:36,606
Marichka, we need a boat.

1143
01:20:37,349 --> 01:20:41,194
A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat.

1144
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:44,280
We need a boat.

1145
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:50,119
A fucking boat! A boat.

1146
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,456
- A rowboat!
- Yes.

1147
01:20:52,655 --> 01:20:54,332
Hurry.

1148
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:56,743
- You okay? Come on.
- Hurry.

1149
01:20:56,743 --> 01:20:58,368
Hurry. Hurry.

1150
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,475
It's okay.

1151
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,814
Look at that, Theo.
They love my baby.

1152
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:45,851
I want to call her Bazouka.

1153
01:22:45,853 --> 01:22:47,487
Bazouka?

1154
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,488
You don't like it?

1155
01:22:49,523 --> 01:22:51,699
I was getting used to Froley.

1156
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:54,453
Froley's a man's name.

1157
01:22:55,237 --> 01:22:59,791
What is he thinking, giving you
a boy's name? You're a girl.

1158
01:22:59,992 --> 01:23:03,795
We have a boat. Stay here.
In one hour, we go.

1159
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:05,463
Thanks.

1160
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:07,548
Human Project real?

1161
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,217
It better be.

1162
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,001
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!

1163
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,502
Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands in the air!

1164
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,963
Okay, is clear! Is clear!

1165
01:24:37,965 --> 01:24:40,006
Hands above your head
and fucking move that here.

1166
01:24:40,007 --> 01:24:41,341
You killed my fucking cousin!

1167
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,301
Get on your knees!
On your knees, you fucking...

1168
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:45,271
He was 19!

1169
01:24:45,471 --> 01:24:47,440
Don't kill him!

1170
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,650
Don't kill him!

1171
01:24:50,476 --> 01:24:52,404
Watch the flanks!

1172
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,823
Kee. Thank God.

1173
01:24:57,192 --> 01:25:00,494
You'll be safe now.
How's the child?

1174
01:25:06,784 --> 01:25:08,368
You put their lives at risk.

1175
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,121
Just let her go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1176
01:25:10,122 --> 01:25:12,914
No? Look around you.

1177
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:14,500
It's the Uprising.

1178
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:17,377
And they haven't even
seen the baby. Let's go.

1179
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:19,430
No! Get off...

1180
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:21,340
Not in front of the girl.

1181
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:24,217
Wait till we get around the corner.
Then do them all.

1182
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,427
Come on!

1183
01:25:25,429 --> 01:25:27,721
<i>Oh, lads</i>

1184
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:30,692
<i>You should have seen us gannin'</i>

1185
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:35,863
<i>Passing the folks along the road
And all of them was starin'</i>

1186
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:40,734
<i>And all the lads and lasses there
They all had smilin' faces</i>

1187
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,103
Fuck!

1188
01:26:23,987 --> 01:26:25,956
Sorry. Sorry.

1189
01:26:44,675 --> 01:26:47,476
Move it! Get her inside!

1190
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,396
Faron!

1191
01:27:00,189 --> 01:27:02,733
Get her inside!
Get her in the building now!

1192
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:04,150
Now! Move it! Now!

1193
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,645
Sarge, left flank!

1194
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,314
Slug the fuckers!

1195
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,987
Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens!

1196
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,521
Go check the roof!

1197
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,641
I was carrying
the baby up the stairs.

1198
01:30:15,342 --> 01:30:17,479
I started crying.

1199
01:30:17,762 --> 01:30:21,315
I'd forgotten what they looked like.
They're so beautiful.

1200
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,484
They're so tiny.

1201
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,820
Julian was wrong!

1202
01:30:26,896 --> 01:30:29,105
She thought it could be peaceful!

1203
01:30:29,106 --> 01:30:33,203
But how can it be peaceful
when they try to take away your dignity?

1204
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:35,747
We need him, Theo!

1205
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:38,666
We need the baby. We need him!

1206
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,505
It's a girl, Luke.

1207
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,966
A girl?

1208
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:52,012
I had a sister.

1209
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,185
Theo! Theo!

1210
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:16,496
You okay?

1211
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:19,832
How is she?

1212
01:31:20,324 --> 01:31:21,742
Annoyed.

1213
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:36,317
My God, the baby.

1214
01:32:36,318 --> 01:32:39,828
Move back! Fucking move back!

1215
01:32:42,364 --> 01:32:45,909
Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing!

1216
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:47,411
Cease firing!

1217
01:32:47,412 --> 01:32:48,871
Cease firing!

1218
01:32:48,872 --> 01:32:50,163
Cease firing!

1219
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:51,632
Cease firing!

1220
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:09,149
We've got two coming through,
coming out.

1221
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,376
Second floor, left!

1222
01:34:10,369 --> 01:34:12,005
Medic!

1223
01:34:25,135 --> 01:34:26,510
Marichka!

1224
01:35:11,389 --> 01:35:13,983
No, Marichka no go. You go.

1225
01:35:14,016 --> 01:35:17,153
- You go.
- Marichka, come. Marichka.

1226
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,280
- Marichka, get in the boat!
- Go, boat!

1227
01:36:28,882 --> 01:36:31,144
The buoy! Theo, the buoy!

1228
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,061
You okay?

1229
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:44,030
Yeah. You?

1230
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,658
Yeah.

1231
01:36:49,695 --> 01:36:51,663
What a day.

1232
01:36:52,739 --> 01:36:54,833
We're too late, aren't we?

1233
01:36:54,868 --> 01:36:56,743
No. No, we're fine.

1234
01:36:56,743 --> 01:36:58,244
But they said they wouldn't wait.

1235
01:36:58,246 --> 01:37:01,173
Trust me. They'll come back.

1236
01:37:15,345 --> 01:37:17,680
I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding!

1237
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:20,275
- No, no, no, it's me.
- I'm bleeding everywhere.

1238
01:37:21,269 --> 01:37:22,310
It's me.

1239
01:37:22,311 --> 01:37:23,738
What?

1240
01:37:24,855 --> 01:37:26,439
He got me.

1241
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,899
Bad?

1242
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,536
No. I'm fine.

1243
01:37:31,529 --> 01:37:33,663
Keep her close, Kee.

1244
01:37:34,532 --> 01:37:38,293
Whatever happens,
whatever they say,

1245
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:41,296
you keep her close.

1246
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:46,801
It's going to be okay.

1247
01:37:53,885 --> 01:37:57,020
She's probably got wind. Wind her.

1248
01:37:58,014 --> 01:38:00,149
Put her on your shoulder.

1249
01:38:00,682 --> 01:38:03,485
Just... Just tap her back.

1250
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:13,621
Gently.

1251
01:38:18,868 --> 01:38:20,327
Gently.

1252
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,143
There you go.

1253
01:38:39,012 --> 01:38:41,148
Oh, Jesus.

1254
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,653
Dylan.

1255
01:38:48,773 --> 01:38:52,577
I'll call my baby Dylan.
It's a girl's name, too.

1256
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:16,225
Theo?

1257
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:21,021
Theo?

1258
01:39:27,228 --> 01:39:28,529
Theo!

1259
01:39:43,202 --> 01:39:45,837
Theo, the boat.

1260
01:39:48,207 --> 01:39:49,841
The boat!

1261
01:39:51,752 --> 01:39:53,470
It's okay.

1262
01:39:53,837 --> 01:39:55,722
We are safe now.

1263
01:39:56,506 --> 01:39:58,141
We're safe.
