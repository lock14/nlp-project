<i>Zudrate.</i>



<i>Repo</i>



Out from the night,



from the mist, steps the figure.



No one really knows his name for sure.



He stands at 6'6" head and shoulders.



Pray he never comes
knocking at your door.



Say that you once bought a heart



or new corneas,



but somehow never managed
to square away your debts?



He won't bother to write or to phone you.



He'll just rip the still-beating heart
from your chest!



<i>Repo</i>



<i>Man</i>



- <i>Repo</i>
- Hey, come on. Quick.



<i>Man</i>



Now, you could run.



You could hide. You could try to.



But he always has a way of finding you.



He will come at your weakest hour,



when no one is around
who might rescue you.



<i>Repo man</i>



<i>Repo man</i>



And none of us are free
from this horror,



for many years ago, we all fell in debt.



New body parts were needed
to perfect our image,



and until our debts are clear,



we will live in fear of the...



<i>Repo man</i>



Vote no on Prop 598
and keep repossessions legal.



If companies like GeneCo
couldn't repossess organs...



Vote no on Prop 598.



<i>Tune in to tonight's Genetic Opera</i>



<i>to witness Mag's farewell performance.</i>



<i>... Genetic Opera</i>



<i>to witness Mag's farewell...</i>



What is this?



You disgust me.



I'm sorry, Mr. Largo.



I'm afraid... I'm afraid it's terminal.



You don't have much time.



It's spreading rapidly.



Things you see



In a graveyard



Things you see



In a graveyard



Maggots. Vermin.



You want the world for nothing.



Commence your groveling.



Rotti, your king, is dying.



Even Rotti Largo cannot
prevent this passing.



Who will inherit GeneCo?



I'll keep those vultures guessing.



Things you see



In a graveyard



I'll keep those vultures guessing.



Things you see



In a graveyard



I'll keep those vultures guessing.



Guessing, guessing, guessing.



This will be quick



It's in my sight



I'll capture it



Then run back inside



And be back home in time



Industrialization



Has crippled the globe



<i>Enjou GeneCo's dau and nighttime</i>
<i>formulas of Zudrate.</i>



Nature failed as technology spread



<i>Ask a gentern if Zudrate is right for uou.</i>



And in this wake, a market erected



<i>Buuing Zudrate</i>
<i>from an unlicensed source is illegal.</i>



An entire city



Built on top of the dead



And you can finance



Your bones



And your kidneys



For every market a submarket grows



No.



But best you be punctual



With making your payments



Lest it be you on the concrete below



It's quick



It's clean



It's pure



It could change your life



Rest assured



It's the 21st century cure



And it's my job



To steal and rob



Graves!



No! Please, please, stop!



Stop!



<i>Grave robbers on 7 I



Oh, no! No...



<i>Lockdownl Lockdownl</i>



<i>Grave robbers</i> on...



Oh, no!



No, no, no, no!



It's locked!



This way, kid.



Wait! You're going to get us caught!



Wait! Wait!



Jackpot!



So why care for these
petty obsessions?



Your designer heart still
beats with common blood



And what if you could
have genetic perfection?



Would you change
who you are if you could?



'Cause it's quick



It's clean



And it's pure



No. I shouldn't be here.



It could change your life



Rest assured



I have got to get home.



It's the 21st century



Cure!



This cannot be happening



And it's my job



To steal and rob



- Graves!
- No, no, no, please!



<i>Grave robbers will be executed on sight.</i>



<i>Gravesl</i>



<i>Let them go.</i>



I didn't know. Please.



Hey!



I can't read.

- Dad.
- Hey



It was a close one



Dad.



Too close



Dad, what happened?



You're gonna be all right



Now that's all that matters



Was I outside?



No, Shi



There were these bodies



You missed your medicine



And fell unconscious



- They were all dead.
- Nonsense.



Please be more cautious



You could go into shock



But it was real, Dad



I am the doctor, and I'm your father



I didn't imagine this



Please, Shilo, drop it



Couldn't have fathomed this



Please, Shilo, stop it.



Dad, I could smell the dead.



You could have died! You...



You scare me to death!



A blood disease



That took your dear mother from us



Passed from her and into your veins



I'd be lost if I were to lose you



I will stop at nothing to keep you safe



I'll take my meds, Dad



Don't you worry



Just until I find a cure



Your mother, rest her soul



Would be so proud of you



Though you cannot see her



She is here with you



We will always be there for you



In your time of need



Shilo, you're the world to me



Shilo, take your medicine.



I'm



Infected



I'm infected



By your genetics



Shilo, I'm the doctor



Shilo, I'm your father.



Oh, Shilo, that was close.



Take your medicine



I'm infected



By your genetics



I'm infected



I'm infected



By your genetics



And I don't think that I can be fixed



No, I don't think that I can be fixed



Tell me why, oh, why



Are my genetics such a bitch



It's this blood condition



Damn this blood condition



Mother, can you hear me?



Thanks for the disease



Now I am sequestered



Part of the collection



That's what is expected
when you are infected



That's what is expected
when you are infected



That's what is expected
when you are infected



How much of it's genetics?



How much of it is fate?



How much of it depends



On the choices that we make



He says I have a right to



I also inherit his shame



Is heredity the culprit?



Can I stop it, or am I a slave?



I want to go outside



Outside



I want to go



Outside



Outside



Ladies and gentlemen



<i>Signore, signori</i>



Don't you dare touch your TV



Tonight's genetic opera
is the place to be



That's right, friends!



Where did our daughter go?



It's me she must escape



My burdens I can't erase



The mother I might have saved



- <i>Assassin</i>
- <i>Murder</i>



<i>Monster</i>



Marni, I need you now



Look what I've become



The nightmare that she should fear



Is the father you left alone



The years roll by without you, Marni



17 have come and gone



I raised our Shilo with the best intentions



But there is something I can't tell her



I'm lost without you here



I am only living out a lie



Shilo can never leave



She is my everything



Nothing can bring you back



Shilo is all I have



- <i>Assassin</i>
- <i>Murder</i>



<i>Monster</i>



Years roll by without you, Marni

He left me in charge, sister!



I don't take lip from a

My brother and sister should fuck



Pavi, shut the fuck up.



I'm the smartest and the toughest



I will find a hole and fuck it



If there ain't one, I will make one



Luigi don't take shit from no one



One brain, mark it up



Only I got brains enough



That's why Pop
will leave GeneCo to me



Me, me, me, me, me



Ask a gentern who they prefer



10 out of 9 will say the Pavi



The most dashing, panty snatching



I will leave your diapers dripping



Two hearts, mark it up



Pavi steals all of the hearts



You ain't got the guts, brother



All bark but no lungs, brother.



Dad will leave GeneCo to me



You wait



Time will tell

- Luigi's fists...



...will rule you!
...will woo them all.



- When I inherit...

Ashes.



Dust.



My children were a bust.



They shall inherit nothing.



No, no.



My legacy is too great



to throw away on ingrates.



Nathan Wallace had potential



Till he stole my Marni away.



In denial, Nathan blamed himself



for Marni's sudden death,



and never once thought



to suspect the man
who wrote his checks.



I guess...
I'll take it to my death!



Things you see



In a graveyard



I'll take it to my death.



Marni, it's Rotti.



You never should have left me.



I would have given you the world.



It's been difficult to see you



after what you've
put me through.



You forced my hand and made me do...



Well, it looks like I'll be joining you.



It seems the man
who cured the globe



cannot stop his own extinction.



But I can go out with a bang!



No!



I can go out with a bang.



Things you see

No, no, please!
I can't be outside.

Shilo, thanks for coming.



It's nice to see



Young talent blooming



My kids have been...



Well, disappointing.



I'm Rotti Largo.



I know.



I own GeneCo



Please let me go.



Sorry to be



So difficult



I had no choice



You're a tough one to find



Climbing through holes



Tell me, why do you hide...



- I'm not.
- Your pretty face?



I cannot be outside



I have a blood disease



But there is hope, an antidote



And you could be the first



To sample it, the GeneCo fix



To all blood diseases



And I can use someone like you



The poster child of progress



It's the cure you sought, Shilo



Your chance to see
the world, Shilo



In your grasp



I don't...



A function awaits.



Will you be my date?



I can't.



Blind Mag will be there.



- Mag?
- You two should meet



No.



I must leave



My dad will worry



Who says that Dad



Needs to know everything?



<i>Repo man</i>



<i>I hate to do this</i>



It's a thankless job



But somebody's got to do it



Penile tissue inch by inch



Skinnin' off the muscles slow



Harvesting the kidneys for the fall



Savin' up the livers in the fridge



No one ever thanks me
when I'm done



How self-absorbed people can be



With a slice



Or a snip



Eeny meeny miney moe



With a cut and a stitch



Returning organs good as new



It's a thankless job



But somebody's got to do it



Got to do it!



Like a mop!



Like a mop.



And a broom.



And a broom.



No one wants a thankless job

Where are we going?



Where are you taking me?



Mr. Largo, how are you?



The folks at home would like to know
your thoughts and views



about Zydrate use...



And its abuses



Would you care to comment, sir?



Well, thank you, sir.



Let me direct the matter
to my daughter



The mind behind
the Zydrate support network



Welcome Amber to the stage



Welcome Amber to the stage



How old are you?



17.



I had my first surgery
when I was 13.



And thanks to Z,



I couldn't feel
or remember a thing.



A month later, I was turning tricks.



<i>I'll keep a lock on it all</i>



Drug market



Submarket



Sometimes I wonder
why I ever got in



Blood market



Love market



Sometimes I wonder
why they need me at all



Zydrate comes
in a little glass vial.



A little glass vial?



A little glass vial.



And the little glass vial



goes into the gun like a battery.



And the Zydrate gun



goes somewhere
against your anatomy.



And when the gun goes off, it sparks,



and you're ready for surgery.



Surgery.



Grave Robber



Grave Robber



Sometimes I wonder
why I even bother



Grave Robber



Grave Robber



Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all



And Amber Sweet
is addicted to the knife.



Addicted to the knife?



Addicted to the knife?



And addicted to the knife,



she needs a little help with the agony.



Agony.



And a little help comes
in a little glass vial



in a gun pressed
against her anatomy.



And when the gun goes off,



Miss Sweet is ready
for surgery, surgery.



Grave Robber



Grave Robber



Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all



It's clean, it's clear, it's pure.



- It's what?
- It's rare.



It takes you there.



It what?



It takes you there



It's clean, it's clear...



Before the cut



It's clean, it's clear...



I can do nothing at all



It's surgery, it's surgery.



It's surgery.



It's the way your friends
may change inside.



Feel alive



Hey, that's Blind Mag's song.



Who did that?



So you think you got heart



So you think you got balls



So you think Mag can sing



I don't think nothing at all



So you think Mag has pipes.



Well, it's my turn to shine.



When the Repo Man strikes!



What are you talking about?



Mag's contract's got
some mighty fine print.



Some mighty fine print?



Some mighty fine...



And that mighty fine print



puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament.



If Mag up and splits,



her eyes are forfeit.



And if GeneCo and Rotti so will it,



then a repo man will come,



and she'll pay for that surgery.



Surgery.



Surgery.



I can't feel nothing at all



Cleanin' up the city since 030



<i>I can't feel nothing at all</i>



Sir, we have Amber.



<i>We're bringing her in.</i>



<i>Incoming message.</i>



<i>Incoming message.</i>



<i>Nathan Wallace, come to mu office at once.</i>



Honey?



Are you awake?



Well, who ordered pizza?



I could sure go for a slice!



Oh, never too pressed
for that dramatical entrance



You wanted to see me?



Thank you for coming



Have your new assignment



Hot off the meat truck!



Is there a reason why



You couldn't phone me this target?



This is a job of special importance.



It is involving a GeneCo employee,



a singer we all know.



That has-been soprano



A traitor to GeneCo



Tonight is her last show



I can't afford a scandal here



Please handle Mag as best you can.



Take her down



But Mag's eyes...



Are GeneCo's.



I know this may seem hard



Mag was Marni's best friend



You break my friggin' heart



You can reunite them.



I cannot do this job



Remember who you are.



Remember what you did to Marni.



Must I take you back there



Please don't take me back there



Why relive that moment?



I can't relive it



That dark, fateful night



When you murdered your wife



It's too painful



Marni was past helping



Marni was past helping



Shilo's life was slipping



Shilo was slipping



She needed her dad,
and I needed skilled hands



So I fixed things



We made an agreement



I will honor that agreement



- You'll do as you're told
- I'll do as I'm told



So Shilo never knows



About that dark and fateful night.



Or my secret repo life



Don't deny your repo life



Dear Marni, I am so sorry



Can you forgive me for this?



Not the death doctor
with the hungry scalpel



Here's my prognosis, will they live?



Doubtful.



You're the street physician



Carving rare sculptures



Paint your ass like a Rembrandt



Ha! You like that?



Better start praying
when you see him coming



For tonight, it's curtains



You're the night surgeon



I remember



Remember what you did to Marni



And who you are



I remember



Remember what you did



To your knife!



See it glide.



See it slice!



Who's your night surgeon?



I hope you have my money



Or it's <i>buon viaggi</i>



He'll do your ass like dishes



Amputation



Remember who you are



- Please, please, please!
- I remember



Remember what you did to Marni



Remember who you are



I remember



Remember what you did to her



Remember who you are



I remember



Remember what you did to Marni



Remember who you are



I remember



Remember what you did to her



I remember every dying whisper



Every desperate murmur



I remember when I gazed upon her



She looks just like you



I remember



I remember



I remember working every victim



With acute precision



I remember every time I hold you



My blunt companion



I remember



I dismember



'Cause the claims medic gives no anesthetic



90-day delinquent
gets you repo treatment



Remember horror
on your street corner



Make your mama boil you



I'm a night surgeon



I remember



Nathan!



I cannot do this job.



Find someone else.



No one walks away from me.



He wants out?
Then I will take him out.



Shilo? Is your name Shilo?



Can I talk to you?



Can you come down, please?



- Why?
- So we can speak.



I saw you at the show



I thought I'd seen a ghost



Your resemblance is striking.



You have your mother's eyes, her hair



I was told you died with her



All these years have come and gone



How do I put this?



I'm your godmom



State your business.



Business?



What do you want?



I want, I want



To finally meet you



Something real
to cling to, leave you



With the hope that you will go to



All you're meant to, all I failed to



In you is a world of promise



We have both been
kept in bondage



But you could learn
from all my failures.



I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.



Or let them through the gate?



That, either. A big risk.



- A big fence.
- A big mistake.



A new friend.



Oh, my God. Mom?



How'd you do that?



- Do what?
- That. That eye thing.



These eyes can do more than see.



I know. I mean, I've seen you sing.



- Where?
- From my window.



I can see the world from there.



Name the stars and constellations.



Count the cars
and watch the seasons.



I wish we could have watched together



I can't have guests.



- Never?
- Ever.



If Dad found out
that I'd been let out



or that you'd been let in...



I should go, then, before I do



- Promise me you won't
- Better that you don't.



Don't forget a sheltered rose



It's best if I resume my life



Needs a little room to bloom
outside her bedroom



<i>Chase the morning</i>



<i>Yield for nothing</i>



<i>Chase the morning</i>



<i>Yield for nothing</i>



Let your life be a dream



Integrity, honesty



It's too late for me



Don't look back



Till you're free
to chase the morning



<i>Yield for nothing</i>



<i>Chase the morning</i>



<i>Yield for nothing</i>



<i>Yield for nothing</i>



Hi, Nathan.



Mag.



How did you get in here?



Don't you have a show tonight?



- How are you, Nathan?
- Busy.



You never were



A man of many words, Nate



- You told me Shilo died
- Listen...



Nathan, I promised your late wife



I'd be present in Shilo's life



Please, Mag



Shilo's very ill



It's not safe



For her to see people



I need to give her her medication.



Dad, let her stay in here



No, she's leaving



Please hide her here



- From what?
- She'll be dead



Look, I told her she was sick



Nathan, you are hurting me



- Dad!
- My daughter needs a rest



I'll be fine, Shilo, don't you fret



Repossessions are dangerous



You're not safe



- Dad, she's not safe
- Shilo, don't you fret



- Leave my daughter
- Your daughter's



She is sick



You've turned this house



- Into a zoo
- I can't have this



Marni wouldn't want this for you



Set her free



- Please don't leave
- Set her free



Come back



- Keep it down, Shi
- Come back!



It's your bedtime, it's late



- Dad, am l...
- Please



- She will die
- Nonsense



- It's arrived, Dad
- Nonsense



- It's a contract
- A contract?



- Come and see
- Nonsense



Come see



Mag's in trouble, Dad



Where'd you get this?



Read it, Dad, a repo man will come



and take Mag's eyes!



There are things in life



That we do best to leave alone



She'll die, you must help her, Dad



- That are beyond control
- You must stop her



That you don't want to know



Will you save Mag?



She will lose her eyes



Unless you stop this repo man



Shilo, this is senseless



- Dad, you have to try.
- Shilo



- This is pointless.
- You can't let her die!



Please, shut up!



Your mother's death
taught me to accept



That nothing ever lasts in this world



Foolish dreams
can destroy a grown man



What chance has a 17-year-old girl?



I don't know what I was thinking



There's no sense in girlish dreaming



I'm just 17, 17



And it's better than 40.







Mama drama's got to go







Nothing's gonna bring her back







Experiment with something living







Because I'm sweeter than 16



Hey, hey! Hey, hey!







I've always longed for true affection







But you compared me to a corpse!



Dead, with the dead



- I'm joining the living
- 17



Because I'm freer than 16



Hey, hey! Hey, hey!



Shilo.



Something's changing



I can feel it



17 now



Why can't you see it?



17 and you can't stop me



17 and you won't boss me



You cannot control me, Father



Daddy's girl's a fucking monster



I'm sorry.



<i>Shilo.</i>



<i>Listen, alll</i>



I've never been
so surgically maimed



Amber, please, it's not that bad.



I'll be the laughingstock of the stage



Daughter, please, it's not that bad



This is your fault,
I asked you to help me



No, Amber, please



I warned you about this



Happiness is not a warm scalpel



I don't care! It's not fair!



Baby, baby, baby,
don't do this



I will never sing again



I gave you the life I wished I'd had



I look like a crime scene, Dad



All you ever do is take, take, take



All I ever do is give



That surgery was only 90 grand



I did not complain



When you changed your name



From Largo to Sweet



I need a stage name!



You are a disgrace



Your genes are not worthy of mine



Are you okay, Daddy?



I'll have one of my surgeons fix you up



so you can sing tonight.



Thanks, Daddy.



Flesh is weak.



Blood is cheap.



Inconsistent.



Consistently



Use your sense



Save your cents



The only thing with persistence is



Gold



It makes the world go round



Gold



It makes the world go round



But before I go



My kids will know



About the man they have crossed



As Marni did the day she fled



And became Nathan's wife



She forced my hand,
he dug her grave



I will not be betrayed



Empty the trash of all of them



And leave it all to the kid



Lay the bait



Shilo's fate



But only if



And will she appreciate



That gold



It makes the world go round



Gold



It makes the world go round



Gold



<i>Shilo, I have uour cure.</i>



<i>Tonight all will be revealed.</i>



<i>See uou at the opera.</i>



So Rotti thinks he can take Shilo.



Dad?



Nothing, Shilo, nothing



Go to bed



Why didn't you tell me
I had a godmother?



What?



What are you talking about, precious?



<i>Lovelu, Mag, sing</i>



<i>Attention, all GeneCo personnel.</i>



<i>Apprehend the Repo Man</i>
<i>Nathan Wallace at once.</i>



<i>Bring him to me.</i>



<i>I want Nathan Wallace taken out.</i>



Shilo?



Come to the opera with me



Shilo!



Tonight we are betrayed



Keep Shilo safe



Make Rotti pay



I'll man his grave



At the opera...



tonight.



<i>Shilo, this dress</i>



<i>once belonged to uour mother.</i>



<i>I would be most honored</i>



<i>if uou wore it to the opera.</i>



I must be brave



Come, come what may



Can I be saved?



Is there a way at the opera tonight?



I've made my peace



No chance for peace



I hold no grudge



I'll end this grudge



I'm gonna sing



I'll stain the streets



- My final song
- They'll run with blood



At the opera tonight



One more hit for the show



- Make it fast
- Take it slow.



One more hit of the glow



Go get cut.



For tonight's show



Tonight I set the stage



Tonight we set the stage



My greatest play



My greatest face.



I'll take the lead



- My greatest rage!
- Pavi gets laid.



All debts are paid



At the opera tonight



<i>Repo man</i>



- <i>Repo man</i>
- <i>Freezel</i>



At the opera tonight



Repo man, come take my hand



At the opera tonight



Repo Man



My eyes



<i>Repo man, at the opera tonight</i>



Bloodbath



It's gonna be a bloodbath



'Cause no one crosses GeneCo



No, not even Repo



Will Rotti clean house?



Damn, we're gonna find out



At the opera



Stay tuned.



The winner of this blood feud



Will take GeneCo



<i>Tonight's opera</i>



<i>is brought to uou bu rich Prosego.</i>



<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Genetic Operal</i>



Everybody, everybody



Get down, get down now



Stand up



Don't be shy



People, people, people



Everybody, everybody



Testify



Everybody



Get down, get down now



Stand up, don't be shy



People, people, people,
get up, get up, get up



Everybody testify



GeneCo helped me upgrade
my second-class heredity!



Testify!



My liver was wrecked,



but now I can drink whatever I want!



Testify!



Before GeneCo,



my anatomy was completely repressed!



State your names!



Genterns.



Saved!



Everybody, everybody



Testify



Stand up and don't be shy



People, people, people,
get up, get up, get up



Everybody, everybody, testify



I needed a kidney
transplant desperately



GeneCo showed this
single mom sympathy



This makeover came
for a small added fee



Now I look smashing on live TV



- Be healed!
- GeneCo's got it.



You know you want it, baby.



GeneCo's got it.



You know you want it, baby.



GeneCo's got it.



You know you want it, baby.



Testify!



Testify!



Testify!



Testify!



Testify!



<i>Shilo, uou've made it.</i>



<i>You're close enough to taste it.</i>



<i>Your cure, is waiting.</i>



<i>There is but one thing pending.</i>



<i>Help us catch him.</i>



<i>This former GeneCo trainee</i>



<i>who's lost his mind completelu</i>



<i>and managed to escape me.</i>



<i>You saw him</i>



<i>In the graveuard</i>



<i>Thank God mu guards responded.</i>



<i>It seems this fiend has</i>
<i>set his teeth on uou,</i>



<i>so be on guard. He's coming.</i>



<i>We'll use uou as bait</i>



<i>to draw this snake out of his hole,</i>



<i>and I am sorru, Shilo, for that,</i>



<i>but this is uour defining moment.</i>



<i>Will uou let uourself be trapped,</i>



<i>or will uou use uour trap to trap him?</i>



<i>Put uour hands together</i>



<i>for GeneCo's favorite</i>
<i>and onlu daughter,</i>



<i>Amber Sweetl</i>



Blame not my cheeks



The pair with love they be



<i>Bring me Repo Man,</i>



<i>and uou will get uour cure.</i>



<i>And now, without further ado,</i>



<i>the event uou've all been waiting for.</i>



<i>GeneCo proudlu presents Blind Mag.</i>



Come take these eyes



I would rather be blind



<i>Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.</i>



<i>Stau in uour seats.</i>
<i>It's all part of the show.</i>



Stay tuned, folks



You don't want to move, folks



'Cause there's more
excitement coming



As an encore, GeneCo will cure



A very sick and needy young girl



She's been caged up like a monster



By her overbearing father



But tonight we're gonna set him right



And for all your viewing pleasures



Didn't I tell you not to go out?



Didn't I?



You did, you did



Didn't I say the world was cruel?



Didn't I?



You did, you did



Then tell me how this happened



What I did wrong, tell me why



Can't we just go home, Shi



And forget this dreadful night?



Didn't you say that you were different?



Didn't you?



I am, I am



Say you aren't that person



Say it



I am, I am



Then tell me how to act, Dad



What to say, Dad, tell me why



All you've ever told me



Every word is a lie



Didn't you say that you'd protect me?



Didn't you?



I tried, I tried



Is that how you'd help me?



Is it?



I tried, I tried



Don't help me anymore, Dad



You are dead, Dad, in my eyes



Someone has replaced you



Dad, I hate you, go and die



Didn't I build a house, a home?



Didn't I?



<i>A cure is waiting.</i>



Didn't I raise her all alone?



Didn't I?



Then Rotti took her from me



Stole my Shilo, he's to blame



Have I failed my daughter?



Then let the father die



And let the monster run



<i>Repo Man</i>



Stop!



You've exceeded all my plans



More than you
could say for Amber



More than I could say for you.



What?



Or your just-as-worthless brother



I just want to get my cure



And I promise to deliver



Don't you lay a hand on her.



Hold your tongue before an elder.



Touch her, and I swear I'll kill you.



Bring it on, you cheap imposter.



Even though I'm terminally ill



I'm dying, you idiots.



Please don't say you're dying, Father.



Please say you ain't dying, Father.



So I planned my perfect end



A tale befitting any opera



And ending only I could spin



Ending you will be my pleasure.



I no longer trust you, Dad.



You can never trust a monster.



And there's more beneath his mask.



Did you know he killed your mother?



It was just an accident



- Accidents can end in murder.
- Shilo, believe me



And that's not his greatest fib



Someone tell me what is going on



Tell her, tell her



Someone tell me what is going on



- Let's leave
- Tell her, tell her



- Let's leave
- Someone tell me what is going on



- No more
- Tell me, tell me



- Tell her, tell her
- Tell me



No more.



May I introduce you



To the man who made you sick?



He's poisoned all your medicine



- I can't breathe
- You've got to fight through it.



Someone, please,
please help my daughter



This will pass.
You've got to fight through it.



I've deceived the only one that matters



- I need my pill.
- You need to know



- You've got to fight.
- It's not your fault



Believe me, Shilo.



It's me who failed you



My stomach.



- It's his medicine
- My medicine



It's your medicine?



I'm the cause



Of all your sickness



<i>Here's to the medi...</i>



<i>That's all there is</i>



<i>Thanks for coming.</i>



Your mother once
promised her love to me



Had she never fled, you'd be mine.



Deny your father now,



for the world to see.



Kill him.



Kill him!



No.



And I'll leave you GeneCo



- What?
- All of it?



Oh, yes.



Oh, no!



So witness it, people.



All I have to do is sign the paper



All you have to do is pull the trigger



- I want you to do what is right
- You want to pay me



- to kill my father?
- This man killed your mother, your mother



- Shilo
- He betrayed you both, he's a liar



- And he poisoned you
- Force me to kill



I am not a murderer



But you share your dad's genetics



What if he passed this to you?



I don't have to share his choices



Didn't you say you were infected?



Didn't you, didn't you?



I poisoned you



I'm worse than Rotti, imprisoned you



I couldn't lose you,
what have I done?



Forgive me, Shilo,
I drugged your blood



Oh, God, what have I done to you?



You used my mother's death
to use my father



You used my father's death
to use me, too



Your dad deserved
whatever happened to him.



He needed me, and so do you.



I remember



Remember my mistakes



Remember you can change



Remember that I love you



I'm sorry that I failed you



Remember that it's up to you



To go and shape your life into



One that's worthy of remembering



No!



Dad!



Dad, no, please!



Somebody!



Somebody, please help.



Money-grubbing beggars,
no better than I am.



You! Don't come near me.
You're embarrassing.



You're disgusting.



You're not men. You're creatures.



I'm embarrassed by you.



Get away. I don't need you,
not either one of you.



Go away!



Don't show your face to me.



You're disgusting.



You're not my daughter.



You're nothing.



When I'm gone, GeneCo will crumble.



I doubt the world will remember



how lucky they were
to have Rotti Largo.



Dad, be still



There is nothing you need say



It can wait



Shi, your mother's calling me



Sometimes I wanted to cry



When the people on TV



Were not quite the way we were



Somehow I guess I just knew



But I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



But I do



Sometimes I'd stay up all night



Wishing to God



That I was the one who died



And sometimes there's
not enough time



But I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



But I do



I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



I didn't know I love you so much



But I do



Shilo, go



Dad, I will not leave you here



You will live



But you've already saved me, dear



Go and change the world for me



And we will always have each other



In our time of need



- Daddy
- Shilo



You're the world



To me



Oh, Daddy, please, no.



Please, please.



Please, get up.



Please.



Years



It's been so many years



Resenting the years



And my heredity



Oh, I have hated and loved you



I have hidden behind you



But I finally see



You I've mistaken for destiny



But the truth is my legacy



Is not up to my genes



True, though the imprint is deep in me



It will always be up to me



Up to me



Free at last



Free at last



Goth opera



Blood saga



Sometimes I wonder
how we ever got here



Old grudges



Scorned lovers



Sometimes I wonder
why we all don't move on



'Cause we all wind up
in a tiny pine box.



A mighty small drop
and a mighty dark plot.



And the mighty fine print



hastens the trip to our epilogue.



Epilogue?



But the little girl fled,



and the king is dead.



And the castle is left for the taking.



But GeneCo may survive
if it undergoes surgery,



surgery.



Surgery, surgery.



- Surgery.
- Surgery.
