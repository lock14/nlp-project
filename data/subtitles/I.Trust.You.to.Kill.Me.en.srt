{427}{492}You know, sometimes...
{608}{644}you have to go|through something
{646}{693}to find out|why you did it.
{2645}{2704}There was a friend of mine|who worked on "24"
{2706}{2751}in the art department.
{2753}{2813}And we affectionately|refer to him as "dark Mark."
{2896}{2938}He was a rock and roll guy.
{2940}{2981}And I said, "Look,|we're starting this label
{2982}{3021}and we're looking|for a rock band."
{3108}{3166}He called me|about three weeks later
{3167}{3222}and said,|"I just saw this guy...
{3346}{3392}He plays a dobro
{3394}{3445}and he does this stuff|with pedal boards
{3447}{3493}and-- he's the most amazing|guitar player I've--
{3494}{3540}I've ever seen.
{3954}{4013}I remember|the first day we met.
{4014}{4062}We set up a meeting.
{4063}{4119}So the meeting didn't start|for less than five minutes
{4121}{4177}before they were, like,|calling us assholes
{4178}{4225}and that we would|steal all their music
{4226}{4301}and that we were gonna rip|them off and da-da-da-da.
{4302}{4340}And I remember, I went...
{4342}{4387}I went,|"Well, fuck you guys.
{4389}{4425}Get the fuck outta here."
{4426}{4491}And Jude was like, "No, no, no,|calm down, calm down."
{4493}{4545}And so Jude|finished the meeting,
{4547}{4602}and kind of|struck a deal that
{4604}{4645}we would start|to record stuff,
{4646}{4687}and at any point|if someone was uncomfortable
{4689}{4725}they would leave.
{4726}{4762}And...
{4764}{4817}a year and a half later,|we finished the record.
{4963}{5011}- Ironworks.|- It's me, Manu.
{5013}{5050}Oh, great, all right.
{5120}{5174}Hello, Manu.|Come on in.
{5199}{5254}Hi, how are you?|That's for you.
{5330}{5374}- Yes?|- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
{5376}{5438}You're welcome.|I'm from the South.
{5470}{5518}New Orleans.
{5550}{5625}This is the main|control room.
{5627}{5672}And there is|the main controller.
{5674}{5718}What's up?
{5720}{5778}- What are you doing?|- Good to see you.
{5780}{5822}How'd you feel|about last night?
{5824}{5866}It was all right.
{5868}{5923}Everyone seemed|to really like the show,
{5925}{6000}but I was fighting the sound|on the stage and the lights.
{6002}{6036}I thought you did|a great job.
{6038}{6073}- Yeah.|- I really do.
{6075}{6116}I thought the band|sounded amazing.
{6118}{6189}You guys are really tight.
{6191}{6229}- Yeah.|- I have one criticism...
{6231}{6269}your nervousness,|a little bit,
{6270}{6335}comes off with an edge like--|like you're pissed off or something.
{6337}{6389}I-- I get frustrated|really bad.
{6390}{6437}Yeah, and you gotta|channel that maybe
{6438}{6484}somewhere else,|you know?
{6486}{6529}I'm gonna try.
{6622}{6674}- Nice to see you.|- All right. You're good?
{6676}{6728}Yeah, I'm all right.|How are you?
{6730}{6774}- Good.|- Yeah?
{6906}{6946}Jesus.
{6948}{6997}That's the only time|I'll ever be able to do that.
{7103}{7141}The way this is worded--
{7143}{7187}There are two|areas in medical?
{7189}{7234}- Or two zones--|- Or two stations in medical...
{7236}{7301}- Two stations?|- Yeah, two stations are logged on--
{7302}{7367}Two stations are logged on,|one of them's medical.
{7369}{7434}- Yeah, perfect.|- Okay, two stations logged on, okay.
{7436}{7480}Cool.
{7482}{7531}What's that?
{7533}{7575}- Banana.|- That's that smoothie from last week?
{7577}{7617}- Uh-huh.|- No, I think I'll get a new one.
{7619}{7661}It's brand new,|it's brand new.
{7663}{7710}From last week.
{7711}{7746}I got one last week,
{7747}{7806}And this--|it looked the same. No.
{7807}{7872}You don't like them?|I thought you liked it.
{7997}{8052}You'll like it.|It'll make you better.
{8243}{8286}Stop.
{8288}{8324}Stay.
{8326}{8370}Here we go,|here comes the rehearsal.
{8372}{8433}Rehearsal!
{8435}{8485}- I want Eugene on that side.|- And action!
{8577}{8629}Well, I met a guy who|basically introduced me
{8630}{8694}to a lot of the Appalachian music|and claw hammer music.
{8696}{8790}The melodies were--|were simple and pure.
{8792}{8839}And the lyrics...
{8841}{8879}were...
{8881}{8929}borderline evil.
{9279}{9326}In my 27 years|of working here,
{9327}{9416}I always wanted to work|with an artist that natural to himself.
{9418}{9486}You know, as a producer,|it's very easy to look smart
{9488}{9526}because you're|working with something
{9528}{9599}that sort of shines|through any colors.
{9710}{9767}Probably his greatest|gift is his voice.
{9769}{9813}He just gets these|bell tones that...
{9815}{9850}most singers|just don't have.
{10150}{10199}You know,|that kind of stuff.
{10201}{10242}- Cut!|- That's a cut.
{10244}{10290}- That was an awesome take--|- Hey, Nick.
{10459}{10554}We're working 14 hours a day,|five days a week,
{10555}{10592}101/2 months a year, so...
{10594}{10648}I mean, I spend more time|here than anywhere else.
{10674}{10744}I got my "24" teddy bear.
{10778}{10833}This is my new|emotional partner.
{10867}{10905}The idea to go|to Europe with the band,
{10907}{10956}by the sheer nature|of what we're trying to do
{10958}{11025}in that 14 days--
{11026}{11063}we're gonna pack in|a lot of living.
{11065}{11141}It's like|living... concentrate.
{11143}{11208}I think the most excited|I've ever seen Kiefer
{11210}{11261}is him talking|about the tour
{11262}{11329}that he's gonna do with the band|that he's helping get off the ground.
{11331}{11382}So it's been really fun|to watch him
{11384}{11454}and watch his excitement|as it gets closer and closer.
{11456}{11509}I can listen|to a Beatles song
{11511}{11565}and it'll take me back to when|I was eight years old.
{11567}{11620}I can listen|to a Led Zeppelin song
{11622}{11677}and I could...
{11678}{11773}feel and smell|the first kiss in my life.
{11774}{11864}Music transports me|emotionally
{11866}{11908}faster than anything...
{11910}{11949}I know.
{12101}{12158}I played it for two people|who were very impressed,
{12160}{12200}but they didn't go|"Gotta have it."
{12202}{12270}And I asked one, like,|"You seem to really love this.
{12272}{12333}Why aren't you...?" He said, "Well,|how old is he?" I said "he's 28."
{12408}{12449}He goes, "Man,|the head of my label
{12451}{12489}doesn't wanna hear|about anybody over 25."
{12490}{12544}I went "Oh, okay, cool.|No problem."
{12546}{12601}You know? I mean,|what am I gonna say to that?
{12718}{12761}You know, it's just|an awareness
{12762}{12817}that pop radio is|about the kids right now.
{12818}{12854}And I understand that.
{12856}{12915}But we treat kids now|like they're so fucking stupid
{12917}{12979}we gotta pacify them|with this shit music.
{12981}{13027}It's like-- it's such|an insult to them.
{13190}{13249}He's certainly|got what it takes,
{13251}{13331}more than 99%|of artists that I see.
{13398}{13442}He's got the voice,|he's got the music,
{13444}{13516}the songwriting skills,|the guitar playing...
{13628}{13682}Rocco's future|is right before him.
{13684}{13732}He can take it|if he wants it.
{13734}{13781}And he can fuck it up|if he wants to.
{13783}{13834}I think it's his|to do either with.
{13931}{14004}As an artist,|I think he's absolutely pure.
{14006}{14062}There are times|in my life,
{14064}{14106}because I had kids,|because I was married,
{14108}{14156}because I made|other choices,
{14158}{14228}that I would take|certain jobs as an artist
{14230}{14290}that maybe weren't|the right thing to take.
{14292}{14329}Well, Rocco's|never done that.
{14565}{14609}I think they're all|incredibly talented.
{14611}{14672}I think everybody in the band|contributes an amazing amount
{14674}{14710}to this overall sound.
{14770}{14857}What I want-- people to see
{14858}{14896}this band play live.
{14898}{14966}I think that that in itself is such|an amazing experience.
{15077}{15119}At the end of the day,|you're not gonna be able to say,
{15121}{15170}"Well, the band just didn't cut it|or they didn't have it."
{15172}{15215}Because that's just|simply not the case.
{15217}{15305}They do have it and they can cut it.|So the only question mark...
{15306}{15358}is really... Is us,
{15360}{15430}and our ability|to get them out there.
{15431}{15497}And that's a responsibility|I really do take seriously.
{16010}{16065}- That sounds great.|- Sounds good, yeah?
{16067}{16142}Yeah. We've met Rocco.
{16144}{16205}That's Dave--|bass player.
{16207}{16254}- That's Eryun...|- What's up?
{16256}{16308}...on the drums,|and that's Greg,
{16310}{16350}master percussionist.
{16352}{16432}And the soul|of Ironworks, Mark.
{16474}{16518}Captain Mark.
{17456}{17526}Hold up, hold up.
{17527}{17586}That's where you go back|to the drum for me.
{17588}{17637}Right when the solo starts again,|boom. Big like that.
{17639}{17688}We just need to play|the whole song with more energy.
{17713}{17753}Try it in G,|just to humor me.
{17922}{17956}Before this,|I was working in a cubicle
{17958}{18016}as a transcriber|for reality television.
{18064}{18109}Horrible.
{18164}{18200}You know,|I had a normal job.
{18202}{18257}I was an operations manager|for a retail company...
{18258}{18298}for years.
{18300}{18345}I actually just|stopped working.
{18346}{18409}I was working actually part time.|I had to move back to my parents'.
{18410}{18460}I just couldn't|afford to, you know, live.
{18498}{18541}But hopefully,|I'll be out soon.
{18594}{18661}I've never been to Europe,|so this is so exciting for me.
{18662}{18723}This is gonna work.|It's all or nothin'.
{18725}{18767}And could you go|back to your old job?
{18769}{18824}I could,|but I never will.
{18826}{18872}None of us have|anything to lose.
{18874}{18933}We're just gonna play music|and do what we do best.
{18935}{19017}And hopefully,|people will dig it.
{19071}{19106}- Are you excited?|- Yeah.
{19107}{19142}You guys, like,|leave right way?
{19143}{19190}- Tomorrow.|- Ladies...
{19191}{19244}Hi, how are you?
{19334}{19386}The whole thing about|getting on that plane
{19388}{19422}and going to Europe--
{19424}{19489}I have no idea|what we're doing.
{19490}{19537}He's kind of playing|their tour manager.
{19538}{19585}Now, if you know|Kiefer well,
{19586}{19659}organization is|not his middle name.
{19661}{19715}- Merry Christmas|- Yeah.
{19717}{19779}You can book the dates,|and do the best job you can,
{19781}{19829}but hopefully you|have a scenario
{19830}{19893}that you might want to shoot for,|but even that--
{19895}{19954}I mean, the original plan|has already changed so much
{19955}{20031}and we haven't even|gotten on a plane yet.
{21564}{21599}Rocco?
{21814}{21873}Rocco?
{22066}{22107}Rocco, hey...
{22109}{22170}Hey, mate,|you have an interview.
{22214}{22258}Sorry about this.
{22260}{22313}Okay, so like, 45 minutes|in the lobby, okay?
{22314}{22382}Good? Okay.
{22384}{22445}And when staying|in a foreign country...
{22447}{22532}by yourself with|$40,000 worth of guitars,
{22534}{22599}lock your door.
{22601}{22670}Hey, come on in.
{22672}{22729}We might have|to hit your room.
{22730}{22775}I don't know if|both of us will fit.
{22864}{22898}How's it going?|Good?
{22900}{22943}Yeah, I think.
{22945}{23038}I mean, I had a wakeup call for 8:30,|which I never got.
{23040}{23076}Can you explain to me
{23078}{23118}what is this suitcase that|you carry everywhere?
{23120}{23166}- Which one? This one?|- Yeah.
{23168}{23235}My dad had|a case like that,
{23265}{23348}and he was very funny.
{23350}{23426}He used to carry it around and people|would always wonder what was inside.
{23428}{23496}I remember going|to nursery school with him,
{23527}{23598}and I just remember|how big his beard was.
{23600}{23685}And it was just after he finished|a film called "Kelly's Heroes,"
{23686}{23732}and he had|a leather jacket,
{23734}{23799}and I just-- I can smell the leather|off of that jacket.
{23801}{23872}And I remember|he was always laughing.
{23874}{23935}And I remember that case.
{23937}{23976}So I got one.
{24239}{24279}Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden--
{24281}{24330}the first time that|we will not have partnered
{24332}{24375}with a major label.
{24377}{24443}This is the artist|that we feel
{24445}{24481}most represents
{24483}{24557}what we believe|in creatively,
{24558}{24605}musically, and so
{24606}{24676}this is a very|exciting time for us.
{24678}{24728}If there is one musician
{24730}{24777}that you could|jam with or write with,
{24779}{24823}who would it be?
{24825}{24863}I've actually done it.
{24865}{24937}It was Johnny Cash, and I had|the opportunity to play with him.
{24938}{25019}It was amazing just|to see a true craftsman
{25021}{25093}and a true poet|really lay it down.
{25706}{25749}You smell better|than Rocco.
{25751}{25797}Yeah, you smell better|than Kiefer, by the way.
{25798}{25824}Here we go, guys.
{25861}{25936}I don't think we talked|specifically about
{25938}{26008}the borderline|at 9:30 tonight.
{26010}{26088}If she can tag that in the interview|at some point, that would be great.
{26090}{26140}We're going back|to the office now.
{26142}{26177}Great.|Okay, guys.
{26267}{26314}Do you guys|feel any pressure
{26316}{26396}about playing in London|for the first time?
{27280}{27339}Man, it's cold.
{27587}{27651}Do you have the number|for this place?
{27653}{27733}Hi. We are outside|the Borderline Club,
{27735}{27785}and we're the band|that's playing tonight.
{27786}{27873}And we had a 2:00 load-in,|and nobody's here.
{27874}{27922}Shall we go around|to the back door?
{28038}{28099}Our instruments|can't be sitting in this cold.
{28101}{28156}That'd fuck 'em up, man.
{28219}{28277}This is why|we need roadies.
{28278}{28325}So we're waiting|for Barry to come,
{28326}{28391}and I was wondering if you guys|got ahold of him yet.
{28393}{28453}Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden.
{28455}{28500}He just walked out the door.|He'll be here in a minute.
{28502}{28539}- I guess they're close by.|- Great.
{28541}{28603}Take Beste's guitar with you.|Stick it inside,
{28605}{28673}'cause I think the road cases|will be fine with Rocco's stuff.
{28675}{28732}- Barry?|- Ah, I'm Barry.
{28734}{28772}- Kiefer. How are you?|- Good to meet you, mate.
{28774}{28809}- Nice to see you.|- Nice to meet you. Cheers.
{28811}{28848}You guys were dropped off|at the wrong door.
{28850}{28897}I'll go around the back|and try to get all this lot open.
{28962}{29013}Yeah, it's way over|at the other side.
{29027}{29066}This says there is|going to be a band.
{29068}{29126}It says there is going|to be another band.
{29128}{29220}- It does?|- "Cheap Hotel."
{29222}{29273}- Do you know who they are?|- I have no idea.
{29374}{29443}I think anytime you play a big city,|it's an important concert.
{29445}{29539}Possibly the president|of Polydor Records might come out.
{29541}{29630}He's a big part of what we are going|to do over here,
{29632}{29717}So we need to impress a lot|of people.
{29719}{29789}On the advertisement card,
{29790}{29875}it says Rocco DeLuca|& Cheap Hotel.
{29877}{29940}The memo|we had sent was
{29942}{30009}"Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden,
{30011}{30061}and we need|a cheap hotel."
{30063}{30101}Well, we got|the cheap hotel.
{30103}{30167}Oh, we got the cheap hotel.|Yeah.
{30278}{30321}First with|just the band members.
{30322}{30360}Piss off.
{30362}{30421}No, I'm just kidding.
{30476}{30526}Fuck them.|I don't want them either.
{30611}{30695}Between Etta James and Aretha Franklin|and Billie Holiday,
{30697}{30736}the most beautiful|instrument in the world
{30738}{30783}was a black woman's voice.
{30813}{30853}They're just|angels to me.
{31467}{31523}Please give a warm|Borderline welcome
{31525}{31600}for Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden.
{32552}{32586}It's a London|crowd, man.
{32588}{32628}They take a lot|of work to get going.
{33643}{33722}At this stage in anyone's career,|I'm really hypercritical.
{33724}{33787}Constructive criticisms--|which is,
{33789}{33868}maybe change|the sound a little bit,
{33870}{33932}pace it|slightly differently,
{33960}{33998}but most importantly,
{34000}{34036}play at least|another 200 shows.
{36722}{36765}Tonight's audience
{36767}{36826}was one of the most|striking things I've ever seen.
{36828}{36885}When I see someone|on a stage
{36886}{36936}drop his heart|out there like that...
{36938}{36989}and it's like...
{36990}{37041}oh my God.
{37042}{37095}How are you feeling, guys?
{37097}{37140}That was a rough one, right?
{37142}{37185}Yeah, that's always|how it works, you know?
{37187}{37246}You fuckin'-- we've been talking|about this show from the beginning.
{37248}{37285}Always works out,|you know what I mean?
{37286}{37338}And when it gets built up|and there are so many fuckin' people
{37340}{37401}so we have to meet all these--|fuckin' photo shoots and everything.
{37403}{37445}Then you get up there|and do it and it's just like--
{37447}{37483}The beginning|was hard, right?
{37485}{37535}The whole fuckin'|thing was hard, man.
{37537}{37585}Was it the crowd|or something?
{37587}{37646}- The sound, the crowd--|- The sound was horrible onstage.
{37648}{37705}I'm gonna talk to Shannon.|I'm bummed.
{37730}{37794}They did very,|very well tonight.
{37796}{37859}I mean, for the first time in,|that was a cool show.
{37861}{37910}That was a cool show.
{37968}{38026}- Ow, that hurt.|- You all right?
{38027}{38071}Yes, sir.|Absolutely perfect.
{38073}{38126}We just took|London by storm.
{38442}{38499}Oy!
{38798}{38842}I want to make|a toast tonight...
{38893}{38960}I watched|a band tonight...
{38962}{38997}show some balls.
{38999}{39052}- What are they called?|- Cheap Hotel.
{39054}{39112}...DeLuca and the Burden.
{39114}{39181}And man, you did it.
{39182}{39258}Regardless of whether your audience|was involved or not...
{39306}{39351}they were just|so simply still.
{39400}{39436}Yodel, dude.
{39438}{39484}Give me one second.|I'm gonna go out here and practice.
{39575}{39650}You can yodel right here|right now if you're a man.
{39807}{39873}I know, but-- I'm try-- I need to get it|in my head first before I can do it.
{39874}{39918}It's not there yet.
{39964}{40017}I know how you|think it sounds--
{40127}{40192}- Argh!|- Just go for it, just loud and clear.
{40194}{40241}Fuck you. It's not|that simple, you cunt.
{40243}{40296}All right, I'm going.
{40562}{40624}Hey, Kiefer,|you're a pirate, man.
{40626}{40684}That would|explain everything.
{40709}{40770}Whoa!
{41021}{41067}Not funny.
{41311}{41366}How was your night, man?
{41368}{41415}- Fantastic.|- You had fun?
{41417}{41482}Yeah.|Phone charger.
{41484}{41530}Couldn't tell you|where the phone is.
{41532}{41580}But I know how to|power it when I find it.
{42602}{42649}They didn't|like the set list
{42650}{42706}because it was|a gradual build
{42708}{42768}and it took|too long to peak.
{42770}{42833}I just don't think you were|put here to please everybody.
{42835}{42875}You know?
{42877}{42930}That would be horrible.
{42932}{43008}You gotta have|some kind of a stand
{43010}{43059}and stand against|something as well.
{43061}{43109}And if you're not, then...
{43141}{43184}you're just|being accommodating.
{43871}{43930}- I'm nervous, actually.|- Why?
{43932}{44009}Because the week|before we left,
{44011}{44055}we had sold two tickets.
{44057}{44128}It's generally better if more people|show up than are in the band.
{44166}{44215}Ooh, there, look.
{44217}{44257}One of our taxis is here.
{44259}{44306}Okay.
{44346}{44383}Thank you very much.
{44480}{44534}The rest of it will be|coming from next door.
{44536}{44571}I'm gonna|go over right now.
{44573}{44623}I like the place,|very cool.
{44625}{44685}It's very|traditional looking.
{44687}{44742}I've heard some good|bands have played here.
{44744}{44792}Radiohead played|their show here.
{44794}{44829}I hope it sounds good.
{44831}{44893}This is a good spot.
{44895}{44942}It smells old.
{44944}{44992}This is awesome.
{45306}{45369}My concern is that|it's so close to Christmas
{45370}{45427}And this is|probably the city
{45429}{45464}that we have|the least contacts,
{45466}{45531}the least promotion.
{45533}{45576}We're gonna try and figure out|what we have to do
{45578}{45626}and if it's literally|just handing out flyers
{45628}{45699}or telling people about the show on|the street, then that's what we'll do.
{45701}{45748}We'll see.
{46016}{46087}They don't seem very concerned|about it though, do they?
{46199}{46233}Yeah, shit.
{46235}{46290}- How much is cover charge tonight?|- 20.
{46292}{46349}20 euros?|Are you kidding me?
{46350}{46388}Well, no wonder you're|having a hard time
{46390}{46457}getting people to come in here.|You're kidding me? 20 euros?
{46459}{46496}Kiefer wants|to speak to you.
{46498}{46559}Hey, man, it's Kiefer,|how are you?
{46584}{46632}Good.|I was just curious...
{46634}{46685}I heard that|the tickets were 20 euros
{46686}{46750}and I'm concerned about|not having very many people
{46752}{46788}show up at this show.
{46827}{46882}- To play in front of nobody?|- Right.
{46884}{46923}It's kind of a buzzkill.|It's fine though.
{46925}{46977}We'll have fun anyways.|It'll be fine.
{46979}{47030}We'll play to the bartender|and a couple of friends.
{47032}{47101}Do you have anybody|at any single radio station
{47103}{47151}that would be|interested in me
{47153}{47192}giving an interview|really quickly
{47194}{47230}and playing a track|or two off the CD
{47232}{47272}and explaining what|we're even doing here
{47274}{47309}and what this tour|is about?
{47383}{47429}Okay, mate, thank you|very, very much.
{47430}{47473}I really appreciate it.
{47498}{47534}Check, one, two.
{47586}{47646}Well, we just managed|to get the door price off the ticket
{47648}{47698}and we'll|take it from there.
{47818}{47882}Hi, Ruth.|How are you?
{47925}{47964}Oh, thank you.
{47966}{48010}I'm doing a tour with a band
{48012}{48084}and he's someone that we've spent|the last year making a record for.
{48086}{48126}It'll come out in March.
{48242}{48288}I've been carrying|most of the luggage
{48290}{48327}for the last little while, yeah.
{48329}{48369}Yeah, that's kinda my job.
{48370}{48430}Okay, well, Kiefer Sutherland,
{48431}{48485}it was a pleasure|to speak to you today.
{48486}{48539}- Well, thank you so much.|- Not at all.
{48541}{48585}Give us a quick plug again|for the free gig tonight.
{48586}{48640}Well, I hope maybe we|get a chance to see you
{48642}{48678}down there at Whelan's|at about 9:00.
{48680}{48736}And it's|a free concert and...
{48738}{48773}I think this is|one of the most
{48775}{48835}fantastic bands|that I've ever heard.
{48837}{48874}And I'd love you|to come down
{48876}{48923}and check it out|and see for yourself.
{48925}{48972}The legend, Kiefer,|lovely to talk to you.
{48974}{49029}Good luck with the band, good luck|with the new series of "24,"
{49030}{49074}good luck with everything.|We think you're great.
{49076}{49119}Oh, bless your heart.|Thank you so much.
{49121}{49183}And thanks for the support|and we'll talk to you soon, I hope.
{49185}{49253}- Cheers. Thanks, Kiefer.|- Take care.
{49578}{49631}I think there's gonna|be a point at some time...
{49633}{49668}ahem--
{49670}{49724}where it will be very obvious|for me to step back.
{49726}{49762}Tonight's not it.
{49764}{49850}Tonight we need all of us--|everybody who's on this trip
{49852}{49893}needs to kinda|help fill this place.
{49894}{49948}So that's what we're|gonna try and do.
{50030}{50086}Okay, let's give|out some tickets.
{50134}{50175}- Wanna go see a concert tonight?|- What concert?
{50177}{50228}- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.|- Cool, man.
{50230}{50279}Free concert.|You wanna go?
{50281}{50316}- Yeah.|- You'll love it.
{50342}{50391}Would you guys|be interested in coming to see
{50393}{50425}- a rock show at Whelan's?|- Sure.
{50426}{50489}A friend of ours' band is|playing tonight at Whelan's--
{50490}{50538}- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.|- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
{50539}{50588}Yeah, it's a phenomenal band.
{50641}{50682}That was good.|Let's go up this way.
{50684}{50737}You guys wanna see an amazing|rock and roll show tonight?
{50738}{50805}- What's the name of the band?|- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.
{50806}{50868}- They'll blow you away.|- "24," it's coming on again?
{50870}{50909}Yep, February 12th.
{50911}{50956}...two tickets|to a show tonight at 10:00.
{50986}{51068}I work as an actor, yeah.
{51070}{51141}- Kiefer Sutherland. Nice to meet you.|- Oh, okay.
{51143}{51213}Onto the next stop.|We've got a band that's playing--
{51214}{51257}- What's your name?|- Kiefer.
{51258}{51293}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{51294}{51329}Jack Bauer.
{51331}{51372}Or that, yeah.
{51374}{51412}This is classic.
{51925}{51969}You guys wanna go see|a concert tonight?
{52028}{52073}I am.|Nice to meet ya.
{52075}{52109}- You're not.|- Yeah.
{52111}{52163}- Yeah? Cheers.|- Take care, man.
{52165}{52227}You gotta learn how|to drink those faster.
{52267}{52360}If you're handing out|tickets to a free show,
{52362}{52425}no one believes|you're you.
{52427}{52489}So it's a new|device of mine...
{52532}{52611}It was very funny.|Dave started to make me laugh.
{52613}{52677}He said, "Thanks for|bringing me on this trip.
{52678}{52733}It's good to see that the label's|going so well.
{52734}{52789}Free concerts,|what a great idea."
{52845}{52895}The cab driver|actually asked, he said,
{52897}{52937}"So is this for|a charity or something?"
{53027}{53063}At least the rain stopped.
{53318}{53373}- It's gettin' packed.|- The press is here too.
{53375}{53433}- That's great, that's awesome.|- Yeah.
{53435}{53501}Fuck. You did good work|really quickly, man.
{53502}{53546}- Huh.|- You should be proud.
{53548}{53586}You did really|good work quickly.
{55131}{55187}I've known Rocco|for quite a while now.
{55189}{55226}I met him when|I was 13 years old.
{55290}{55351}Rocco is definitely|an interesting person--
{55380}{55473}very kind,|but he has this deep...
{55474}{55514}sense of pain|sometimes
{55516}{55552}that I don't even|know much about.
{55602}{55638}I think that fuels|some of his writing
{55640}{55718}and his passion.
{55720}{55764}It's very simple|to say, "Well, you know,
{55766}{55823}It's just a show, it's just|a rock and roll band."
{55825}{55876}But music|moves people, man.
{55878}{55957}And the more you travel about,|the more you see
{55958}{56011}how important|it fucking is, you know?
{56076}{56150}I think he's always known|that this is what he wants to do.
{56152}{56191}I don't think|he's had a normal job.
{56622}{56661}Thank you,|thank you.
{57160}{57223}Thank you for asking,|we appreciate it.
{57912}{57953}My father was|a traveling musician
{57954}{57998}and wasn't|around very often.
{58066}{58113}He had two brothers
{58114}{58162}who also played music.
{58163}{58200}So there was always|late-night jam sessions
{58202}{58273}and lots of interesting characters|hanging around.
{58314}{58378}My mother, I just met...
{58380}{58415}about three years ago.
{58481}{58546}All I had of her was...
{58548}{58588}a couple|of magazine covers.
{58639}{58725}She was a model|in Los Angeles... I guess.
{58864}{58924}She just wasn't ready to really|take care of a baby.
{58926}{58971}So my grandmother
{58973}{59027}took me out|of that situation.
{59350}{59400}I haven't seen|my mom since I met her
{59402}{59492}and I haven't seen my dad in about|three or four years now.
{59548}{59595}Do you have any|anger for your mother?
{59597}{59666}I don't have any anger|for her, no. Not at all.
{59668}{59733}So where does all this|anger in your music come from?
{59735}{59788}Well, maybe I do then.
{60380}{60436}It's not towards anybody.|It's a cry for help.
{60438}{60477}You know?
{60479}{60515}It's a cry--|it's a cry to be healed.
{60517}{60554}That's just the universe,
{60556}{60604}that's just|the way things work.
{60606}{60665}You gotta plant with|the blood, you know?
{60666}{60733}And... that's the only way|you'll get a soulful flower.
{61571}{61606}Thank you very much|for listening,
{61608}{61660}we appreciate it.|Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.
{61662}{61703}Yeah, yeah.
{61845}{61883}I can't thank you enough.
{61885}{61956}This is one of the most important nights|I've ever had.
{61958}{62045}Today at 1:00, we had two people|coming to the show.
{62046}{62082}And...
{62084}{62133}tonight we have|this audience
{62135}{62208}with a standing ovation|and the encore.
{62268}{62313}Congratulations.|You did it.
{62314}{62350}He's like a soul brother
{62352}{62397}who wants to journey|to the end of the night,
{62399}{62471}you know?|Who wants to see...
{62473}{62513}what this whole thing|is fucking about.
{62515}{62581}I'm impressed,|I'm proud, I'm all of that.
{62582}{62637}I just--|took my breath away.
{62638}{62703}This was like|a trigger for me.
{62705}{62764}I needed another gear.|I think you guys did too.
{62766}{62816}- Yeah.|- You know?
{62818}{62852}You guys played|your ass off.
{62854}{62891}- Thank you.|- It's all good.
{62893}{62954}- You broke my heart.|- Thank you.
{62956}{63021}We have a connection.|We both, you know,
{63023}{63061}had fathers,|I guess, that were...
{63063}{63114}always not around.|I don't know
{63116}{63162}if that has anything|to do with it.
{63656}{63728}I quit smoking|two months ago.
{63964}{64029}I didn't realize|how much I wanted it.
{64030}{64081}Not only for the label,|but for the band.
{64083}{64173}And not only for the band|but for the label.
{64404}{64451}What a night.
{65003}{65054}Kind of a big room.
{65126}{65179}I'm gonna go steal|some salt from the kitchen.
{65224}{65277}That's what you do at night|when you can't sleep?
{65278}{65351}Well, when I've|been up a few days,
{65353}{65389}and...
{65391}{65442}I'm singing|every night...
{65491}{65527}I just...
{65529}{65577}sometimes, need a little bit of--|should we go in there?
{65625}{65685}Yeah? I need|a little salt to...
{65786}{65849}to gargle.
{65851}{65900}For my throat.
{65958}{65999}John Lee Hooker|was a hero of mine.
{66001}{66067}And a little while ago
{66069}{66116}before he passed on,
{66118}{66161}I got to open up|a couple shows for him.
{66206}{66265}I remember|the first show I played...
{66296}{66332}I was at the Sun Theater
{66334}{66385}And I did|my sound check.
{66387}{66449}And I was about|to get off and...
{66451}{66535}I was playing|by myself and...
{66537}{66585}and John Lee Hooker|said "Hey, man."
{66617}{66688}He said "You go ahead|and sit in my chair
{66690}{66725}when you play, okay?"
{66726}{66767}And that was all he said.
{66811}{66860}I was really proud|to be a part of those shows.
{66885}{66932}It's very cool.
{67010}{67058}Very cool.
{67256}{67317}Good afternoon, reception.|How may I help you?
{67319}{67359}Everybody's sleeping.
{67361}{67418}I think. I don't know.
{67492}{67554}- Hello, camera crew.|- How you doing, dude?
{67556}{67626}I'm good, but I'm naked.|What's the plan?
{67628}{67681}We were supposed to|check out two hours ago,
{67683}{67744}- I know that much.|- Okay.
{67746}{67789}Hello?
{67815}{67864}Everyone looks|like they're beat.
{67966}{68021}Hey, David,|have you seen Kiefer?
{68023}{68093}Nobody's heard from him?|Aw, that's awesome.
{68094}{68138}- Hey, man.|- Hey, how you doing?
{68140}{68189}I see everybody's checking out|about three hours late.
{68191}{68253}- I know.|- They just talked to him.
{68254}{68321}He's up and he didn't|know what time it was,
{68322}{68359}or he would've been up
{68361}{68400}and gone to the library|and read a few books.
{68546}{68589}How you doing,|man, this morning?
{68591}{68664}I'm doing fine.|I just don't have enough luggage.
{68832}{68901}This is gonna be|a long trip downstairs.
{68963}{69004}Yeah.
{69006}{69052}That's attractive.
{69409}{69474}Now, undo all this|stuff to make sure
{69476}{69527}I haven't lost this phone.
{69611}{69658}It's upstairs.
{69660}{69707}I gotta find this phone.
{70090}{70133}Do you lose a lot|of stuff when you go out?
{70232}{70268}Two wives...
{70309}{70356}two lives...
{70358}{70408}yeah, I have.|I have.
{70454}{70506}Why do you let me|film you at night
{70508}{70561}when you do|all this crazy stuff?
{70563}{70612}I don't think|it's that bad.
{70648}{70696}Whatever, I mean,|I'm not here to judge that.
{70698}{70744}But why do you|let me film you?
{70839}{70888}Because this band|is worth seeing.
{70890}{70942}Yeah, but I don't need|that to see the band.
{70944}{70984}I can film the band.
{70986}{71069}I mean, usually famous people|try to be very private.
{71071}{71133}Why is that you let me|film you as you are?
{71135}{71195}Not the you-- a very strong actor|and professional--
{71197}{71237}but the you|in your private life,
{71239}{71293}going out, having fun|with your friends.
{71328}{71382}I don't know yet.|I'll have to think about that.
{71590}{71638}You coming?
{72941}{72985}What happened|to the sun, man?
{72987}{73047}The sun?|Bring on the night.
{73049}{73084}What time is it?
{73086}{73158}It's 9:35...
{73160}{73199}in the morning,|and it will stay like this...
{73201}{73254}well, till 12:00 or 1:00 actually,|in the afternoon.
{73256}{73310}And then...|black as night.
{73374}{73421}- Hello.|- Welcome, my name's Adel.
{73422}{73457}- I'm sorry?|- Adel.
{73459}{73501}Adel. Kiefer.|Very, very nice to meet you.
{73502}{73561}- You're the host of the show?|- Yeah.
{73614}{73688}My mother is a very|successful theater actor,
{73690}{73769}and both my parents|were incredibly supportive.
{73771}{73849}And they knew that it was going to be|very important for me
{73851}{73913}to make the mistakes|that I was gonna make early on.
{73962}{74027}You mentioned your mother,|Shirley Douglas.
{74029}{74117}And her father is one of the greatest|Canadians of all times.
{74119}{74179}He's called "the father|of Medicare in Canada."
{74181}{74233}"The father of Medicare|in Canada," yeah.
{74234}{74289}Have you ever thought|about going into politics?
{74290}{74344}I grew up in parliament
{74346}{74394}watching|my grandfather speak,
{74396}{74474}and it was not something|that I felt as comfortable with
{74476}{74538}as what I do now,|which is work as an actor.
{74635}{74682}- You were here last year.|- Mm-hmm.
{74684}{74739}And I think every|Icelander noticed that
{74741}{74799}because you were in the papers.|There were a lot of stories about you--
{74801}{74838}See, I can't read Icelandic.
{74840}{74925}When I was here, I didn't realize|I was in the paper that much.
{74927}{74981}Maybe you're lucky that|you can't read Icelandic.
{74982}{75030}Not that they were|bad stories,
{75032}{75070}but there were a lot|of stories about
{75072}{75137}your going out,|drinking
{75139}{75189}- and--|- Those are true.
{75191}{75228}They're all true?
{75230}{75295}Yeah, well, we went out|and we went drinking.
{75297}{75374}But, no, on some level obviously,
{75376}{75433}stories get exaggerated.
{75435}{75493}As for going out|and having--
{75495}{75537}at least what I consider|to be a fun time--
{75539}{75573}yeah, we did that.
{76529}{76609}Okay, that's your|Christmas present.
{76611}{76648}You all get a girl.
{76650}{76702}Don't say I never|did nothing for you.
{76704}{76773}- Aw, did I get the brunette?|- I knew you'd do it.
{76774}{76835}I'm sorry. Can I give you|my gift to you right now?
{76837}{76932}- You all get a girl.|- Oh, cool. Aw, you get the brunette.
{76934}{76976}Merry Christmas.
{76978}{77014}Merry Christmas.
{77016}{77066}Cool, dude.|Thanks.
{77182}{77243}That's my wrapping paper|inside there.
{77444}{77516}After this film,|I'm going to need this.
{77518}{77563}I love it.
{77565}{77624}We were talking about that|the whole time last night.
{77626}{77695}"I want to wish you the best of luck|out there in the big city.
{77697}{77775}I just hope you don't forget|the rest of us when you become famous.
{77777}{77826}Just go out there|and get 'em, kiddo.
{77828}{77885}Merry Christmas|and happy birthday."
{77886}{77957}- Hey, I love you to death.|- You too, man.
{79618}{79653}I wonder if anybody|reviewed the show.
{79654}{79733}I'd like to have that.|That'd be cool.
{79735}{79781}Be careful of that.
{79783}{79849}It's an old lesson.
{79850}{79906}Do your thing.
{79908}{79950}If you get|caught up in that,
{79952}{80017}Even if it starts|off really great,
{80108}{80182}if you believe that there,|then you've got to believe this here.
{80184}{80256}Just fuck 'em.
{80330}{80376}- Kiefer...|- Yeah.
{80378}{80417}What was Christmas|for you when you were a kid?
{80419}{80457}It was good.
{80459}{80515}It was either with|my mom or my dad.
{80517}{80592}The best Christmas|I ever had I was about 14.
{80594}{80634}- What happened?|- I had a girlfriend.
{80636}{80719}- oh, your first one?|- In Toronto, yeah. First serious one.
{80721}{80805}And I had a job|in a restaurant.
{80807}{80889}Yeah, I remember|feeling fiercely independent.
{81540}{81609}This parade.|Is this a traditional thing?
{81611}{81665}People walk down here?|Yeah.
{81667}{81721}Always to this one they're|peace walking--
{81723}{81761}The people|on the main street.
{81763}{81846}- Same time every year.|- Every year, yeah.
{81914}{82009}Tonight, we are having|a traditional Icelandic Christmas feast.
{82010}{82094}- Smoked goose.|- Smoked goose-- fantastic.
{82096}{82142}- Try it.|- This is my granddaughter.
{82144}{82189}- Hi. How are you?|- I'm fine.
{82190}{82252}- Nice to meet you.|- thank you.
{82314}{82397}I'm gonna get a water.
{82399}{82470}I want to get a--
{82472}{82521}You don't like goose?
{82523}{82590}- I don't like food.|- Why?
{82592}{82672}I've just never been|a food guy, you know.
{82674}{82753}Cheeseburgers and pizza|is pretty much the end of it for me.
{82755}{82820}No, I'm not going|to eat that right now.
{82821}{82871}- Why not?|- I'm not very hungry right yet.
{82873}{82919}I'm sorry.
{82921}{82989}What about|pickled goose?
{82990}{83037}- I had the goose.|- You had the goose?
{83038}{83073}I had the goose.
{83075}{83144}But this is|Icelandic traditional.
{83146}{83228}I'm going to try it.|I just need a minute.
{83230}{83289}- You need a minute?|- Just a minute.
{83291}{83354}- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
{83789}{83847}Went to Rocco DeLuca,|had great concert.
{83849}{83943}Yeah, he had very good concert,|of course.
{83945}{83993}How do you fucking know?|You weren't there.
{83995}{84079}But I just know it.
{84139}{84207}The horses are approaching|the starting gate.
{84209}{84280}They're all in line.
{84282}{84323}All set...
{84325}{84383}And now, away they go.|All came out well.
{84385}{84434}On the outside we have|"Kid Shredding" and "Spaghetti Dancer."
{84436}{84486}Those two are fast.|Now "Superfluously" takes over.
{84488}{84539}"Paramour" in the orange|is giving up second
{84541}{84600}As "Big Fine" comes through|in the white blinkers to get third.
{84602}{84653}"Real Wild" showing speed|down at the rail in the white colors.
{84655}{84711}"Go Go Louie's" right there too,|with "True Pioneer,"
{84713}{84748}As they all bunch up|on the lead now.
{84750}{84793}Then comes Paramour,|the we drop back to Go Go Louie,
{84795}{84855}Racing four lengths|off the lead.
{84857}{84904}We come to the top of the lane.|It's wide open.
{84906}{84948}True Pioneer,|one from the rail width.
{84950}{85012}They come for home now! It's "Nash|Rudin" on the grandstand side,
{85014}{85077}Spaghetti Dancer in the black,|but Nash Rudin flying.
{85079}{85130}Spaghetti Dancer|trying to keep him off.
{85132}{85190}These two nose and nose,|Kid Shredding with a shot too
{85192}{85257}But it's going to be Nash Rudin,|and Nash Rudin goes on to score.
{85578}{85665}Okay, I still have to find it.|I think it's two more doors down.
{85723}{85770}You're lost, Kiefer?
{85772}{85812}- Nah?|- Where's the venue?
{85814}{85889}I've never been|here to this--
{85938}{85994}Here we are.
{85996}{86047}Get the fuck|out of here!
{86049}{86088}You get the fuck|out of here.
{86089}{86124}How are you?
{86126}{86162}This is where we're going|to load in through?
{86164}{86204}We're going to start|bringing in the equipment.
{86205}{86249}You can come|this way as well.
{86251}{86296}Yeah, we have the truck|backed up here,
{86298}{86341}- we're going to come right this way.|- Either way.
{86637}{86686}Ready to fight.|You ready?
{90906}{90965}One picture,|just you and me.
{90967}{91013}Well, you're too fucking big|to say no to.
{91205}{91249}Thank you|so much, mate.
{91346}{91401}Sing it. Come on,|it's too beautiful
{91465}{91511}It's funny|that they know this.
{91513}{91588}It's not as funny|as it was 10 years ago.
{91773}{91818}Viva la Iceland!
{92275}{92336}You should check|if you're here somewhere,
{92338}{92385}and Rocco.|Do you think you are?
{92386}{92452}It's not of great concern to me,|to be honest with you.
{92453}{92492}Oh, okay.
{92493}{92565}Ah, here you are.
{92566}{92644}- Aha.|- Dum-dum-dum-dum-da-dum...
{92645}{92733}"Heroes Also Fail."
{92734}{92780}Do you want me|to read this for you?
{92781}{92869}Not particularly. Do they talk|about the show last night?
{92871}{92953}Now somebody's going to write|about the actual concert.
{92955}{92989}That's what|I'm interested in, yeah.
{92991}{93056}And that's not|in the paper today.
{93430}{93485}I phoned her from England,|just to tell her
{93487}{93567}that we got to Europe safe,|and it was my birthday.
{93569}{93630}And she said,|"Have fun.
{93632}{93678}But remember,
{93680}{93737}Now you're 39."
{93738}{93789}Like that somehow was going|to magically make me...
{93791}{93845}"okay."
{93846}{93884}What did she mean?
{93885}{93925}Grow up.
{93962}{94041}In all fairness, my mother's|pretty much usually right.
{95117}{95164}- New tattoo, Kiefer?|- Hmm?
{95165}{95216}- New tattoo?|- Yeah.
{95218}{95301}It's "I Trust You|to Kill Me"
{95303}{95377}In Icelandic rune.
{95379}{95452}It means that I've already come|to terms with the fact
{95453}{95492}that you're|coming after me,
{95493}{95568}and there's nothing you can do now.|I've accepted it.
{95629}{95717}It means that whatever|it is I'm going to do,
{95718}{95755}I'm going to do|the way I see fit,
{95757}{95797}and the way|I think is right.
{95909}{95963}So you don't care about|what people think anymore?
{95965}{96006}No.
{96008}{96085}I think that's ridiculous.
{96086}{96137}Of course I care|what people think.
{96139}{96186}But I've accepted the fact
{96188}{96249}that some people aren't|going to like what I do.
{96251}{96327}And if I can|accept that now,
{96329}{96393}then it protects my ability|to go forward and do it.
{96394}{96479}The times that I've made|terrible mistakes as an actor
{96481}{96558}have been when I tried to do something|I thought someone else would like,
{96560}{96607}and it didn't come|from my heart.
{96650}{96709}And this tattoo will always|remind me of that now--
{96710}{96753}to not make|that mistake.
{96791}{96825}So this trip|is a passage
{96827}{96864}towards something|else for you?
{96865}{96915}It's becoming|that, yeah.
{96917}{97008}I wasn't as clear|about that when we started,
{97046}{97122}but it's definitely|becoming that now, yeah.
{98339}{98407}Kiefer put that tattoo|on his arm, man.
{98409}{98481}He put "I Trust You to Kill Me"|on his arm,
{98483}{98550}which, you know,
{98552}{98617}you could put|worse things on your body.
{98673}{98764}I mean it's-- this means something|to us. It matters, you know.
{98765}{98807}And he's-- you know--
{98809}{98891}that's one of his ways|of expressing that it matters.
{98893}{98944}It's a heavy deal.|It's good.
{98945}{98982}It's very good.
{98984}{99041}Isn't it beautiful?|I love it, man.
{99042}{99102}I want to go play|right now.
{99487}{99551}Heavy stuff, man.|It's crazy.
{99669}{99761}I'm glad we got|a chance to come here.
{99763}{99839}This is kind of|a symbolic place to be.
{99887}{99952}I don't know. We have our own walls|in the United States too.
{99953}{100039}And we have-- every country has|their own walls.
{100041}{100126}This is just a reminder
{100128}{100197}not to divide,|but to connect.
{100241}{100297}The "West Wonder"|McDonald's moved in.
{100364}{100444}Now I can go to East Germany and|get a fucking Big Mac.
{100445}{100532}Where's Starbucks?
{100534}{100604}If everything works out well, hopefully|one day there will be a Wal-Mart.
{100994}{101089}Certainly the idea|of making a film
{101090}{101141}about the band
{101143}{101185}was something that was|very interesting to me,
{101186}{101250}and I'm also at a point|in my life
{101252}{101324}where I'm discovering|a lot about myself.
{101373}{101444}I didn't think that would probably be|as much a part of this film
{101446}{101509}as it's kind of become.
{101581}{101649}Look, I've spent|most of my life
{101650}{101697}really protecting|my privacy.
{101698}{101783}The only time|that it's ever a problem
{101785}{101826}Is when I do something|really stupid
{101828}{101900}and I just end up|embarrassing my family.
{101901}{101968}And they don't|deserve that.
{101969}{102041}Some people might go,|"What a spoiled ass.
{102043}{102121}Privileged little prick."
{102123}{102170}And...
{102227}{102300}"It's not that hard,|get your shit together."
{102302}{102370}You know...
{102372}{102418}And whoever|does say that,
{102420}{102483}I'm right there with you.
{102532}{102599}You know, sometimes...
{102719}{102797}you have to go through something|to find out why you did it.
{102799}{102879}I don't completely get it.
{102881}{102922}It really has|almost everything to do
{102924}{102990}with just taking a chance|on something, finally.
{102992}{103079}Stop being so scared.
{103121}{103197}And if everybody ends up|not liking you because of it,
{103234}{103293}well, they weren't going to like you|for real anyway,
{103294}{103330}so there you are.
{103332}{103378}And right now|that's the best reason
{103380}{103434}I can tell you why I'm letting|you do this.
{103466}{103531}We'll be here|all week, folks.
{104052}{104108}Very interesting.
{104109}{104173}This is going to be|a strange setup.
{104175}{104229}- Where's the stage?|- Here and here.
{104285}{104345}Looks like more of a restaurant|than anything.
{104347}{104386}But I'm sure|it will be fun.
{104419}{104470}Oh, God.
{104472}{104526}What is that?
{104528}{104600}It's a piece of shit.
{104602}{104656}These are|the speakers here.
{104657}{104726}- You're kidding.|- It's not going to work.
{104728}{104791}We need to find somebody who|knows exactly what's going on here.
{104793}{104882}There's a little misunderstanding|where we're playing.
{104884}{104949}They're trying to get|ahold of Kiefer, I guess--
{104951}{104999}figure stuff out.
{105099}{105169}Pizza in Germany.|It's good.
{105171}{105216}You think the guys|are looking for you?
{105217}{105296}I think they were surprised|when they called upstairs
{105297}{105365}and said, "We're ready to go,"|and I said, "Good, go."
{105367}{105413}But this band|is proving themselves
{105415}{105476}show after show|after show after show,
{105477}{105524}and they are finding|an audience--
{105525}{105586}sometimes 300 people|at a time.
{105588}{105653}So they don't|need you anymore?
{105655}{105692}I was very aware|that there is a time
{105693}{105745}that I'm going to have to really|step out of the way,
{105747}{105815}because...
{105817}{105856}I'll be in the way.
{105925}{105998}I think there's another|stage downstairs.
{106000}{106059}Is there really?|Bigger?
{106061}{106095}Yeah, that's|what they told me.
{106097}{106146}- Wanna go look at it?|- Sure.
{106216}{106296}Yeah, this is more like it.
{106325}{106362}There's no point|in playing upstairs.
{106364}{106400}This looks like|it would be cool down here,
{106402}{106440}but upstairs|is ridiculous.
{106442}{106526}It's cool, but not|for playing rock, though.
{106528}{106590}When I was a kid,
{106592}{106643}my dad used to|tell this story
{106645}{106728}that-- when I was like|two or three years old,
{106729}{106798}and it was when my mother|and father split up--
{106800}{106856}I was running,|I was chasing something
{106857}{106922}and I ran into the wall.|I missed the door.
{106924}{106983}And my father started to laugh|really hard.
{106985}{107027}And he said|for about two months
{107029}{107099}I would just run
{107101}{107149}full force into a wall|just to make him laugh.
{107151}{107197}And, maybe...
{107199}{107260}the Christmas tree|is part of that.
{107261}{107302}So you wanted|to please your father,
{107304}{107362}because you were making him happy|when you were doing that?
{107389}{107444}I like watching|people laugh.
{107445}{107503}So what, next Christmas|you're not going to tackle a tree?
{107505}{107553}So that was my last|Christmas tree.
{107670}{107717}I hope.
{107759}{107827}- It's not a jazz combo.|- No, that's not how the place is.
{107829}{107874}I'm not going to play|for a dinner crowd.
{107876}{107945}It's not people in suits, having dinner|with their grandmothers.
{107947}{107993}Well, I'm telling you,|because you asked me.
{107994}{108077}We'll play downstairs after midnight,|or we just won't play at all.
{108079}{108132}And Kiefer can figure it out|when he comes.
{108133}{108181}Other than that, I don't want|anything to do with it.
{108183}{108261}- I'm pissed off about it.|- Why are you pissed off?
{108343}{108391}Don't be pissed off.|Everybody's trying to make it work.
{108393}{108448}- It's just been a hard one.|- Everybody's trying to make it work.
{108449}{108511}The guys here are really cool.|Obviously,
{108513}{108605}there's been a fuck-up somewhere.|Let's not try to be, you know--
{108607}{108677}Negative? No, I don't want|to be negative, but it's a rock show.
{108679}{108742}It needs to be treated|like a rock show.
{108744}{108782}Why don't you play|later downstairs?
{108784}{108828}- That's what I was saying.|- Ja.
{108829}{108889}- Thank you.|- I don't think it will be a problem.
{108890}{108945}- Rocco. Nice to meet you.|- Hildegard.
{108947}{109031}- It's all good.|- Okay.
{109033}{109080}Start drinkin'.
{109117}{109163}Good idea.
{109165}{109236}- Kiefer?|- Has been called.
{109238}{109299}I don't know.|He's supposedly on his way.
{109301}{109347}Ah, perfect.
{109349}{109440}Wow, this is|going to be good.
{109489}{109544}I'm just not going to play|for a dinner crowd.
{109545}{109601}Because that's like|happy hour to me.
{109602}{109682}That's like|background music,
{109684}{109749}And that's everything|I'm fighting against.
{109750}{109798}You either work it proper
{109800}{109848}or you don't work it at all.
{109893}{109898}Off to the white trash|fast food
{109989}{110057}for rock and roll.
{110058}{110147}New Year's Eve.
{112442}{112497}How are you doing|out there?
{112593}{112640}He unfortunately|broke his string,
{112641}{112683}so he's going|to take a second.
{112685}{112718}What time is it?
{112762}{112800}What?
{112802}{112897}5... 4... 3...

{120153}{120223}- Why?|- Now, look at this. Look.
{120225}{120269}Look at this.
{120271}{120351}The sun's out.|The snow's on the floor.
{120353}{120399}I don't know|anybody in town,
{120401}{120448}except for|a handful of people.
{120449}{120503}I think|that's kind of cool.
{120505}{120573}I don't want|to leave that.
{120611}{120696}Oh, my God.|Mr. Sutherland, how are you?
