1
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,356
Hey, Brad!

2
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,408
Don't splash your sister.

3
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:05,759
She ain't my sister!

4
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,760
Well, it's my sincere hope
that she will be.

5
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,338
No!

6
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,781
Hey, try to be friends, okay?

7
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,584
No, goddamn it!

8
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:16,344
- Hey!
- Bill.

9
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,388
Just...

10
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,430
cut him some slack.

11
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:40,808
Let's see yours now.

12
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,537
Kim.

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,502
Ow! Ow.

14
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,384
- Son?
- Ow!

15
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:55,185
What's wrong?

16
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,227
What happened?

17
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:57,347
Brad?

18
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,668
Bill, what is--

19
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:00,870
What is it?

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,432
Let me see.

21
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,234
Show your dad.

22
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:05,596
Let me see it.

23
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,360
Oh!

24
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,002
Oh, God.

25
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,284
Aw, that doesn't look good.

26
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,769
Dawn, honey, are you okay?

27
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,211
Dawn, you all right?

28
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,532
Dawn?

29
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,655
Dawn?

30
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:03,156
We have a gift...

31
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,640
a very precious gift.

32
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:11,044
And... what do you do with gifts?

33
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:15,489
Do you go around giving them
to everyone you pass on the street?

34
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,132
No!

35
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:19,374
No, those wouldn't be gifts.

36
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:23,338
They'd be, like, a handout.

37
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:31,065
So... what about
the most precious gift of all?

38
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,067
Are you gonna give that

39
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,512
to the first guy who buys you
a big bunch of roses?

40
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,394
No way!

41
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,917
No way?

42
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,081
And, um...

43
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:50,004
I'm not just talking to the, uh, girls.

44
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:51,086
You guys...

45
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,769
you have the same gift to give.

46
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:59,173
Are you gonna give that
to some girl

47
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:02,257
'cause she looks like
she just stepped out of a music video?

48
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:03,980
No.

49
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,543
No, you're gonna hold onto it

50
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,586
and share it with
the mother of your children.

51
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,548
Yeah, definitely.

52
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,511
I mean, that's
what the ring is all about.

53
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,923
The way it wraps around your finger,

54
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,889
that's to remind you
to keep your gift wrapped.

55
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,696
Wrapped...

56
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,459
until the day...

57
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,622
you trade it in for that other ring...

58
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,026
that gold ring.

59
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:53,630
Get it?

60
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,192
You were so good!

61
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,235
Because you know
this goes way beyond sex.

62
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:03,680
If you used your hand on yourself,
do you think that's pure?

63
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,483
No way!

64
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,886
And is any of this--
groping, touching-- okay?

65
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,807
- I missed you.
- I missed you!

66
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,649
This whole break, I've been calling--

67
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,211
That job that I have--

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,132
Ugh, mine too.

69
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:16,853
Who thinks that oral sex...?

70
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,737
And my-- my mom.

71
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,939
She's sick again, so, um...

72
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,062
You see,
there are no loopholes

73
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,225
with the Promise.

74
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,466
- I'm sorry, Dawn.
Yeah, sorry.

75
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,670
There is no back door.

76
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,790
Hey, guys.

77
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,312
- Hi, Tobey.
Oh, Tobey!

78
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:38,716
This is our friend, Dawn O'Keefe.
Tobey Cobb.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,124
Tobey just moved here.
We were best friends back home.

80
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:48,326
He starts school with us tomorrow.

81
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:50,930
Hi.

82
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,812
Hey.

83
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:01,860
So, I hear there's gonna be
27 pledges tonight so far.

84
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,622
No way.
Phenomenal!

85
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:04,944
It's you, you know.

86
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:10,069
Oh, I don't know.

87
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,072
It is.

88
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:14,634
People really related
to what you said, but...

89
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,317
especially the way you said it.

90
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,927
# My heart, my heart #

91
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:33,894
# Bye-bye, bye-bye,
bye-bye, my heart #

92
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,136
Hey, Dawn!

93
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,336
Hi, Mrs. Kitchens!

94
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,538
# Oh, my heart, my heart,
my heart, my heart #

95
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,170
Hi, baby.

96
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,372
Come on in.

97
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:14,656
So, how'd it go?

98
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,379
They asked me to come back
to the next one and speak.

99
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,180
Well, of course they did.

100
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:24,386
Hey, sweetheart.
Did you have fun?

101
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,788
Yeah, they had awesome music.

102
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,911
- Mm-hmm?
- And, uh, food. So...

103
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,552
Oh, Kim, you're warm, baby.

104
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,796
You have pain today?

105
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:38,961
Let's talk about young people stuff.

106
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,924
Uh, Gwen and Phil say hi.

107
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,607
They are so adorable.

108
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,811
Wills of iron.

109
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,255
Well, things were a little different
when we were growing up.

110
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:54,897
Hey.

111
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,821
It is different now.

112
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,625
Hey, honey, we're not complaining.

113
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,827
You are a blessing.

114
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,677
Both our children are blessings.

115
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:45,990
Brad!

116
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,751
I got you, bitch!

117
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:50,875
I got you so good! Whoo!

118
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,477
# To know what it's like #

119
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,639
# To dance with him... #

120
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:00,885
# He's so close I can feel him #

121
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,650
#...won't give in
to the feeling 'cause #

122
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,732
# Love is worth waiting for #

123
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:13,259
# Love is worth waiting for #

124
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,231
# My heart is... #

125
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,287
All right,
here's your chance.

126
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:43,129
Make a move, stud.

127
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,653
Hmm... gimme.

128
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:47,735
Give me it.

129
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,934
Mm-hmm.

130
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:09,075
Love is worth waiting for!

131
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:13,559
Wait? Yeah, I'll wait
for the bitch to get her panties off.

132
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,001
What kind of soda
do you guys got, huh?

133
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:17,004
- We got cherry.
- Let's pop that cherry!

134
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,486
Go on!

135
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,411
Sorry!

136
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,052
- Hey, Tobey.
- Hey, Dawn.

137
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,134
Quite a welcome.

138
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:28,336
Dick.

139
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,099
Great. You're not allowed
to actively thwart it.

140
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,299
All's fair, dude.

141
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,822
Okay, dude.

142
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,028
So, questions?

143
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,269
That's it, then, for the penis.

144
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,192
Let's move on to the...

145
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,754
to the, ahem...

146
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,116
uh, the next page.

147
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,963
The female... privates.

148
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:02,730
- Um, there's something weird in my book.
- Leave it.

149
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,134
I have it too.

150
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,254
A sticker.

151
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,934
What's it hiding?

152
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:10,099
The state school board
has rightly ordered it be concealed,

153
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:13,302
a detailed diagram of-- of the--

154
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,663
Vulva!

155
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:15,945
Oh, my God.

156
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,028
That's fucked up.

157
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:21,591
Why are they covering that up?

158
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,552
That should be obvious.

159
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,114
They showed the penis picture.

160
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,716
- That's different.
- How so?

161
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:29,837
The sad thing is, Ryan,
you'll probably never know.

162
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,441
Right?

163
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,124
Uh, Dawn.

164
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,686
I think I can tell you how it's different.

165
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,849
Girls have a natural modesty.

166
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,250
It's built into our nature,
and so depicting...

167
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,135
They do!

168
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,109
Oh, great!
I read about that one.

169
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,952
Phil, that's rated R.

170
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,635
Oh, I hear it's good.

171
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,240
I'm not saying we should see it.

172
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:14,245
You know what, even the PG-13
is gonna have heavy making out.

173
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,971
Well, there's...

174
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,182
Sorry.

175
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:33,345
It's okay.

176
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,788
Bunny.

177
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,580
How'd that happen?

178
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,303
I was a little kid.

179
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:13,586
No one ever told you?

180
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,750
No, they never figured it out.

181
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:23,034
What?

182
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,682
I think she bit it.

183
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,806
She... who?

184
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,850
Dawn.

185
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,533
A baby bit the end
of your finger off?

186
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,415
Here, hit this.

187
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,153
Hey, guys,
where are we going?

188
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,635
You'll see!

189
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,855
Isn't this a big make-out spot?

190
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,177
Only at night.

191
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,864
Do you think this is a good idea?

192
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,265
We're in a group.

193
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:32,988
We'll police each other.

194
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:36,631
Right?

195
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,082
Is this private property?

196
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,567
Watch out
for the poison ivy.

197
00:15:56,692 --> 00:16:00,176
- Whoa.
Phil, what are you doing?

198
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,783
Whoa.

199
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,547
Wow.

200
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:12,990
Is that a cave?

201
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,390
Yeah.

202
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,315
People go there to... you know.

203
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,371
You like that?

204
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:43,900
You know, I do have
a perfectly good pussy.

205
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,823
I'm sure you do.

206
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:48,905
Well, I do.
Other boys like it just fine.

207
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,869
Ow.

208
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,429
Well, fuck them, then.

209
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,728
Hey, Mother!

210
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,569
Hey, come over here.
Get in.

211
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,050
Come on, get in!

212
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,333
Whoa!

213
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:18,136
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

214
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:20,259
A little too close.

215
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,101
You get what you deserve.

216
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:28,907
Really?

217
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,143
Knock it off!

218
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:04,183
Ugh!

219
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,305
Brad!

220
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,348
No, never.

221
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,431
It's never even been a big deal.

222
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:15,194
I just... always knew I wanted
to wait until marriage.

223
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,882
So, no one's ever even touched your...

224
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,483
Absolutely not!

225
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,806
Gosh.

226
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,412
Why, are...

227
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:34,454
- Aren't you?
- I'm a virgin.

228
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,538
- That's great.
- Mm.

229
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,182
In His eyes.

230
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:45,788
Oh.

231
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,554
It was just once...
about a year and a half ago.

232
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:53,594
Right.

233
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,001
Still dealing with the guilt.

234
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:09,329
Actually, you're...
probably stronger now.

235
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:11,972
Your resolve.

236
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:14,655
Because you've been there.

237
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,780
I mean, you've seen
the dangers firsthand.

238
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,243
- Where's the arroyo bridge?
- I'll show you.

239
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,048
WOMAN ON TV
What's happening to you tonight?

240
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:47,690
Keep quiet!

241
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,742
Alive?

242
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,986
I can't believe it,
enduring for centuries like this.

243
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,948
And under all that heat.

244
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,230
Oh, no!

245
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,045
Yaah!

246
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,749
What is wrong with me?

247
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,394
Purity.

248
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:48,958
Purity.

249
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:51,239
Tsk.

250
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:03,772
Back then,
these snakes were born

251
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:07,817
into an environment
with very large mammals,

252
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:10,579
so the diamondbacks
that developed a rattle

253
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,823
had a big advantage
over those that didn't.

254
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,703
They didn't get stepped on.

255
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:17,747
You mean suddenly,
out of nowhere,

256
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:20,190
a baby snake was born
with a big rattle?

257
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,193
The prevailing theory
is that it would have been born

258
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:25,635
with an incipient...

259
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:26,876
Primitive.

260
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,076
Thank you, Ryan.

261
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,641
...rattle-like mutation

262
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,323
that would have developed
over thousands of years of evolution,

263
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:34,766
but we don't know for sure.

264
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,125
Got that right.

265
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,049
It's also possible that it happened
exactly as you said,

266
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,932
and that one day
a baby diamondback was born

267
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,974
with a fully formed mutation

268
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:47,377
that just happened to be
extremely beneficial to its survival.

269
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,544
Does this seem irrelevant
to all of you?

270
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,746
Because it's not.

271
00:23:56,988 --> 00:24:00,030
Now, I know a lot of you
subscribe to other theories.

272
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:04,035
But however you think
this was all set in motion...

273
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:05,596
-...it's about your life.
- Hey.

274
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:08,881
It's about why you are
the way you are.

275
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,921
Dawn?

276
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:12,923
This is about you.

277
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,326
And you missed it.

278
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,066
Tobey, listen.

279
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,392
I was really weird this morning.

280
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,915
I think I know why.

281
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:47,198
I had a really nice time.

282
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,480
Me too.

283
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,805
My thoughts haven't been so pure.

284
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,248
Look, I--

285
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,813
I think that we can't
go out together again...

286
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,415
I mean, even in a group.

287
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,578
Even in a big group.

288
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,663
I was thinking the same thing.

289
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:12,064
Just...

290
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,228
didn't want it to be true.

291
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,872
We're so in sync.

292
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:26,799
What is wrong with you?

293
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,843
You look a lot better
with a dick in your mouth.

294
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,285
Fucking bastard!

295
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,328
Why can't we do it normal
like everybody else?

296
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,895
Why do we always have
to do it that way, Brad? It hurts!

297
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:45,459
I don't want to do it!
It hurts! You're not being fair!

298
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,661
...what I wanna do...

299
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,702
Deep down,
I know you don't really like to try--

300
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,305
Fuck you!

301
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,988
I love you!

302
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,307
You love me?

303
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:57,072
Yes.
And you love me too, you know you do.

304
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:59,993
And I love you too. I love your ass.

305
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,364
Yo.

306
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,684
Are you alone?

307
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:30,105
Can I have a serious talk with you?

308
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:40,194
About you and Melanie.

309
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,759
There's no me and any bitch.

310
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,800
Okay.

311
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,884
From what I heard last night--

312
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:50,605
Did that turn you on?

313
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,049
You...

314
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,095
I know we've never been close.

315
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:00,217
We've never been
like sister and brother,

316
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:01,738
and I really don't know why that is.

317
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:02,859
Sure you do.

318
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,023
You know.

319
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,625
I really don't,

320
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,951
but whatever it is,
I'd like for it to change.

321
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:18,153
You know, all that abstinence bullshit?

322
00:27:19,796 --> 00:27:22,119
We all knowhow you've
been saving yourself for.

323
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,323
And I've been real patient.

324
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,807
You think I like living here
with these assholes?

325
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,329
Mom and Dad?

326
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,855
So why don't you just
set that pretty ass down?

327
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:03,803
Dawn?

328
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,321
I need to see you.

329
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:19,538
I brought my bathing suit.

330
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:05,145
That's just how
I imagined you in my mind.

331
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:07,268
You're beautiful.

332
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,670
You imagined me?

333
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:13,714
That's okay. I did too.

334
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:16,236
You. Except...

335
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,881
with less.

336
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,380
This does not feel wrong at all.

337
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:41,444
Uh!

338
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:55,740
Purity.

339
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,007
No, stay in there.

340
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:41,647
I'm freezing!

341
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:52,980
Oh.

342
00:33:58,127 --> 00:33:59,127
Uh.

343
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:01,851
Let's go back.

344
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:02,932
Okay.

345
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,336
Okay.

346
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:09,659
Can I just--?

347
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:13,143
Mmm. Mmm, wow.

348
00:34:13,222 --> 00:34:14,184
Mm--

349
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:19,748
We made a sacred promise.

350
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,032
Get off.

351
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:28,239
- You don't have to do anything.
- No. No, damn it.

352
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,641
Stop-- damn it, Tobey! No!

353
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:33,003
I haven't even jerked off
since Easter!

354
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,965
I am saying no!

355
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:38,168
Tobey, don't! No!

356
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,891
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

357
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:44,014
I'm sorry.

358
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,059
Dawn?

359
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:16,248
Oh...

360
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,289
Stop it! What are you doing?!

361
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:20,813
- Oh, it's okay! It's okay.
- Tobey!

362
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:22,693
You're still pure in His eyes.

363
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,577
No!

364
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,230
What? What?

365
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,713
What?

366
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:44,998
Get off!

367
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:08,021
Get away!

368
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,489
Tobey?

369
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:02,940
# Throw out the lifeline #

370
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:07,864
# Throw out the lifeline #

371
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:15,152
# Someone is drifting away #

372
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:21,119
# Throw out the lifeline #

373
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:25,842
# Throw out the lifeline #

374
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:31,889
# Someone is sinking today #

375
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:43,822
# Throw out the lifeline
across the dark wave #

376
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:52,670
# There is a brother
whom someone should save #

377
00:38:52,710 --> 00:39:01,000
# Somebody's brother,
oh, who then will dare #

378
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,563
- # To throw out... #
That you, honey?

379
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:04,684
It's me.

380
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:06,806
There's dinner
if you want a bite.

381
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,927
I ate.

382
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,210
Thanks.

383
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:15,014
# Throw out the lifeline #

384
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:19,300
# Throw out the lifeline #

385
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:26,146
# Someone is drifting away #

386
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:31,070
# Throw out the life-- #

387
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,898
Just wing it, Dawn.
You'll be fine.

388
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:16,780
Yeah, speak from the heart.

389
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,262
Huh?

390
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,268
- Tobey'll be there.
- You've seen him?

391
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:26,349
He said he wanted to come,
but wouldn't if--

392
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:27,389
When?

393
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:29,233
I don't know,
a couple of days ago?

394
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,793
If it made you nervous,
he said he wouldn't come,

395
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:35,438
but he really wants to support you.
You just always seem to get--

396
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:41,164
Dawn! Yay, Dawn!

397
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:58,463
Mr. Vincent asked me
to talk about purity today.

398
00:41:58,503 --> 00:41:59,943
Purity, yes!

399
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:05,268
Yeah?

400
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,393
And...

401
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,838
yesterday...

402
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:19,045
I could have done that...

403
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:24,088
because yesterday I was pure.

404
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:28,173
" 'She shall be called woman,
because she was taken out of man.' "

405
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:31,617
Adam.

406
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:38,023
- Right.
- I can't make sense of it yet. I--

407
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:39,465
Uh...

408
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:42,146
Is that it? Is...

409
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,992
Is...

410
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,913
Is it the Adam inside?

411
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:47,994
Inside--

412
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:51,518
"'Bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.'"

413
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,561
I don't know.

414
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:56,001
Phew, I don't know.

415
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,329
But there is something...

416
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:08,094
There is something...

417
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:12,338
inside of... me...

418
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:17,344
that's lethal.

419
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:20,385
- The serpent.
- I don't know. I don't know what it is.

420
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,150
" 'The serpent beguiled me,
and I ate.' "

421
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:31,918
I think
what Dawn is getting at

422
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:33,802
is so important, people--

423
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:37,364
exile from the garden.

424
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:41,168
Serpent. Serpent. Serpent.

425
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:43,570
Though it was
not part of God's original plan...

426
00:43:44,612 --> 00:43:48,056
thanks to Eve and the devil, we--

427
00:43:56,824 --> 00:43:57,905
Hey, Dawn!

428
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:00,668
What are you doing here?

429
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:02,590
Oh, you know, checking it out.

430
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,393
I thought if you were so into it,
it must be pretty cool.

431
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,755
- Did you drive?
- Yeah.

432
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:08,996
Yeah, my mom lent me her car.

433
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:10,038
Oh!

434
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:24,614
Uh, listen.

435
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:29,257
Um... do you want
to hang out sometime?

436
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,382
I-- I mean, I know you're--

437
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:35,425
you're not into,
you know, whatever,

438
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,186
but, uh...

439
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,273
L-like a date?

440
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:56,726
That's funny.

441
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,894
- It's not you.
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,416
No big deal.

443
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,322
Oh, what's
so goddamn funny about it?

444
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,364
Damn.

445
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,427
Hey, Brad.

446
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:59,150
Uh, I'm here for Dawn.

447
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:02,954
You're out of your league, pussy boy.

448
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:07,159
- Excuse me?
- Get the fuck off my property.

449
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,121
Hey, uh, listen, Brad--

450
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:10,322
Uhh!

451
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:13,367
If you want any more of that,

452
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:14,326
you can come by
and see us again, yeah?

453
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:46,543
"The toothed vagina
appears in the mythology

454
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:50,108
"of many and diverse cultures
all over the world.

455
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,393
"In these myths,
the story is always the same.

456
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:57,956
"The hero must
do battle with the woman,

457
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,958
"the toothed creature,

458
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,081
and break her power."

459
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:13,373
Kim, honey, I'm gonna call--

460
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,538
I can get someone to cover.
Bill! Oh...

461
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:25,625
"The myth springs
from a primitive masculine dread

462
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:28,628
"of the mysteries of women
and sexual union.

463
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:31,592
"Fears of weakness, impotence...

464
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:36,597
"It is a nightmare image of the power
and horror of female sexuality.

465
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:41,402
"The myth imagines sexual intercourse
as an epic journey

466

"that every man must make
back to the womb,

00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,168
the dark crucible that hatched him."

468
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:55,976
Dark crucible.

469
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,302
All right, Miss...?

470
00:51:01,382 --> 00:51:02,864
I can't read this.

471
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,146
Cobb.

472
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:09,510
What can I do for you, Miss Cobb?

473
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:15,836
Is this your first time?

474
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:21,684
Okay.

475
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:23,483
Just lie down.

476
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:27,610
That's it.

477
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,331
Put your feet right in here.

478
00:51:29,411 --> 00:51:32,735
Mr. Socky... one there,

479
00:51:32,815 --> 00:51:35,217
and Mr. Socky... okay.

480
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,420
Okay.

481
00:51:50,393 --> 00:51:53,436
So, I imagine you have
no idea what to expect.

482
00:51:53,516 --> 00:51:54,797
Not really.

483
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,923
Well, don't worry.

484
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:02,844
I'm not gonna bite ya.

485
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,210
Scoot down.

486
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,612
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

487
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,054
Scoot down, scoot down.

488
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:14,376
Come on, scoot down.

489
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:16,980
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

490
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:19,302
Okay.

491
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:25,389
Let me guess.

492
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,552
You'd like to start on birth control.

493
00:52:27,632 --> 00:52:30,954
No, uh... I just...

494
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:33,358
wanna be... checked out.

495
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:36,521
You know, make sure
that there are no...

496
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,206
adaptations or anything.

497
00:52:43,567 --> 00:52:47,130
I think there might be
something weird going on inside.

498
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,614
Indeed there is.

499
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:55,340
What you're probably
adapting to is womanhood.

500
00:52:56,581 --> 00:52:59,063
Your body is going through
so many changes now--

501
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,146
This might be a little cold.

502
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:10,996
I have a hunch you
are perfectly healthy.

503
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:13,278
Are you sexually active?

504
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,318
No.

505
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,083
Y-yes.

506
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:21,367
In this room...

507
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:24,168
there are no judgments made.

508
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:26,931
Deal?

509
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:31,416
Okay, then.

510
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,030
How's this?

511
00:53:46,311 --> 00:53:47,594
Shouldn't you tell me?

512
00:53:48,914 --> 00:53:50,356
It's good.

513
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,123
Okay.

514
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:05,210
So...

515
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:08,335
Let's test your flexibility.

516
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,905
Ow!

517
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:20,228
Just lie back and relax.

518
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:22,590
Just breathe.

519
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:25,713
Breathe through the pain.

520
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,514
I can't!

521
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,041
Oh!

522
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,164
My goodness, you're tight.

523
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:38,204
Ah!

524
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:40,288
Relax.

525
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:43,690
Yes, now there we go.

526
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:47,096
What? What's--

527
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:51,259
What have you put in here?

528
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:52,862
Didn't--! Aah!

529
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:24,614
Aaaah!

530
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:30,298
It's true!
Vagina dentata!

531
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:33,061
Vagina dentata!

532
00:55:34,784 --> 00:55:36,666
Vagina dentata!

533
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,570
This is the police.
Pull over now.

534
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,811
Pull over now.

535
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,735
Get that thing
out of the way!

536
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:14,985
Tobey?

537
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:16,409
Detective, found something!

538
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:27,820
My God, he's got another one.

539
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:39,592
Mom?

540
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,556
Dad, Mom?

541
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:45,920
Oh!

542
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:49,483
Mom! No!

543
00:57:49,523 --> 00:57:51,364
No! Help!

544
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,530
Ow. Ow.
- Help!

545
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,273
Oh, God, honey.

546
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:22,317
Sweetheart, you gotta get home
and get some rest.

547
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,003
She's gonna need you
chipper tomorrow, hmm?

548
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:32,568
You go.

549
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,132
Be careful.

550
00:58:39,335 --> 00:58:41,777
Emergency room,
how may I help you?

551
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:52,467
I don't even feel
like I know you right now.

552
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:54,710
I don't know what's in the ass
that makes you so excited.

553
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:57,273
You know what?
Probably somebody's...

554
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,333
Get out of my fucking room!
Are you serious?

555
00:59:17,373 --> 00:59:19,054
What is wrong with you?

556
00:59:19,135 --> 00:59:22,539
Why don't you
shut the fuck up!?

557
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:23,619
Shut up!

558
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:26,663
Mom?

559
00:59:28,784 --> 00:59:29,786
Elliot?

560
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,791
- Hi.
- There's no one--

561
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,755
There's nobody else that I can talk to.

562
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:42,840
My mom is in the hospital.

563
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,565
I have to go to the police
and turn myself in.

564
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:48,686
Police?

565
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:56,173
I killed him.

566
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:57,896
You killed someone?

567
01:00:00,018 --> 01:00:01,699
Almost two.

568
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:14,112
Dentata.

569
01:00:15,673 --> 01:00:17,155
What?

570
01:00:17,235 --> 01:00:19,597
It's Latin for "teeth."

571
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,280
A vagina that...

572
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,443
Uh, yeah, I know what that is.

573
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,567
I'm not following you.

574
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:28,807
What again?

575
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:30,688
Vagina dentata.

576
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:34,092
It's what's inside me.

577
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,295
The doctor said so.

578
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:40,259
A hero has to come and conquer them.
That's what they say.

579
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:41,380
Who?

580
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:47,505
The ancient Greeks and Egyptians
and early Christians and Jews

581
01:00:47,586 --> 01:00:52,231
and Polynesians
and lots of Native Americans.

582
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:54,233
Shh, shh.

583
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:16,416
Ahem.
Uh, I'm not looking.

584
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:20,260
My mom takes these
for her nerves.

585
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:45,286
Good. Okay.

586
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:48,489
All right.

587
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,431
Where are my clothes?

588
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,552
Um...

589
01:02:10,632 --> 01:02:12,673
I have to go to the police.

590
01:02:12,755 --> 01:02:16,117
That pill might make you
a little fuzzy-headed.

591
01:02:16,157 --> 01:02:17,679
I have to confess.

592
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:19,961
Yeah, but, uh,
tomorrow, tomorrow.

593
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,523
You want them
to take you seriously, don't you?

594
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:24,887
Come.

595
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:30,012
Have a seat.

596
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:46,108
Take it.

597
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,764
To the smartest, prettiest girl I know.

598
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,447
Oh.

599
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,262
This is how I always
dreamed it'd be.

600
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:25,750
Ooh!

601
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:30,195
Oh... oh.

602
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:32,396
Hey, hey, relax.

603
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,318
Relax. Just rest.

604
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:36,920
Just rest.

605
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,163
I'm right here.

606
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,893
Oh.

607
01:04:55,802 --> 01:04:57,284
Oh.

608
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,286
You can't.

609
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:01,969
D-do you want me to stop?

610
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:08,615
No.

611
01:05:10,938 --> 01:05:12,940
Oh. Good.

612
01:05:15,143 --> 01:05:16,583
But-- they'll get you.

613
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:18,585
Who?

614
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:19,907
The teeth.

615
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:22,030
Oh, come on.

616
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,311
Seriously.

617
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:25,835
No, no, look.

618
01:05:26,914 --> 01:05:29,277
I'm-- I'm conquering them.

619
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:31,278
See? Yeah.

620
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,202
I'm-- I'm-- I'm the hero.

621
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:48,257
We found this embedded
in the penile stump.

622
01:05:48,336 --> 01:05:49,898
So what's it from?

623
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:53,101
Well, dentition is not an exact science.

624
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:58,106
The root design would have led me
to ascribe it to the selachii,

625
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:00,269
the sharks and the rays...

626
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:05,914
but the crown made me think
of the cyclostomes, the lamprey.

627
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,478
See the serration near the tip?

628
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,324
So this comes from a cross
between a shark and an eel,

629
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:15,844
something like that?

630
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:20,130
No. Our tests show that it's human.

631
01:07:05,056 --> 01:07:06,818
Huh.

632
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,782
What?

633
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:15,025
Uh... noth-nothing.

634
01:07:17,148 --> 01:07:20,072
I just-- just can't believe it.

635
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,476
I can't either.

636
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:27,599
I can't believe you're still alive.

637
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:31,682
Uh, right.

638
01:07:47,298 --> 01:07:48,661
I got it. Thanks.

639
01:08:01,393 --> 01:08:04,556
You sure you don't want
to tell us how this happened?

640
01:08:49,762 --> 01:08:51,126
Where you going?

641
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:54,047
I do have to go to the police.

642
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:14,831
Mm, you are my hero.

643
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:33,609
Sweet.

644
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:38,613
Hey, loser.

645
01:09:38,694 --> 01:09:40,095
As we speak.

646
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,698
Oh, yeah?

647
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,020
She's not there.
- Yeah?

648
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,501
- Prove it.
- Say something.

649
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:48,985
- What?
- There's nobody there, man.

650
01:09:49,024 --> 01:09:50,386
- No!
- You hear that?

651
01:09:50,426 --> 01:09:52,948
What?!

652
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,350
Yes.

653
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,194
- Mmm...
- What was that?

654
01:09:58,274 --> 01:09:59,595
Oh, nothing.

655
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,841
We made a bet

656
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:08,364
that I could, uh, you know.

657
01:10:08,444 --> 01:10:09,686
Unh-unh-unh.

658
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:15,853
So... you made a bet about me

659
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:18,855
when I had taken
a sacred vow of abstinence?

660
01:10:18,895 --> 01:10:21,578
I had a hunch
that it wasn't all that sacred.

661
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:22,980
It was, though.

662
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,144
Your mouth is saying
one thing, babe,

663
01:10:26,224 --> 01:10:30,628
but your sweet pussy
is saying something very...

664
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:31,668
different.

665
01:10:38,395 --> 01:10:40,637
Uh, aah! Aah!

666
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:43,761
Oh... shit.

667
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:00,418
Some hero.

668
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:16,475
Mom?

669
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:27,967
You're the daughter?

670
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:33,052
Just a moment.

671
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:37,738
Have a seat, dear.

672
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:04,604
Son?

673
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:09,729
Son!

674
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,613
Oh, what the fuck, Dad?

675
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:13,934
Jesus.

676
01:12:13,975 --> 01:12:16,497
Would you excuse us,
miss, please?

677
01:12:16,577 --> 01:12:17,537
Okay.

678
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:24,545
I want you out of here.

679
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:27,148
Out.

680
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:29,350
What?

681
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:35,957
Oh, right, so...

682
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,161
it's Kim, huh?

683
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,962
Old cunt's making you kick me
to the curb, is that what's going on?

684
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:43,043
Ow!

685
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:45,127
When it rains, it pours.

686
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:46,327
I know, right?

687
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,813
There has got to be a story here.

688
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:53,536
He was in a delirium.

689
01:12:56,979 --> 01:12:58,581
Hardly seems worth it.

690
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:05,787
You want me out of here,
you're gonna have to throw me out.

691
01:13:05,868 --> 01:13:07,590
I should've done that
a long time ago.

692
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:09,712
Yeah, you should have.

693
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,199
Shit!

694
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:28,532
Mother!

695
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:31,734
No, Brad, don't!
Aaahhhh!

696
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:34,096
Uhh.

697
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,140
Uhh!

698
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:41,104
- Brad, you're a fucking--
Yeah!

699
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:43,185
Yeah, who's kicking
who out now, old man?

700
01:13:43,266 --> 01:13:44,747
Aah!

701
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:20,543
Please.

702
01:14:22,987 --> 01:14:24,149
Please, son.

703
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:28,833
Why'd you have to marry her?

704
01:14:28,913 --> 01:14:31,436
Look, I know you loved your mother.

705
01:14:31,515 --> 01:14:33,037
- I did too--
- My mother?

706
01:14:33,118 --> 01:14:35,360
I don't even remember that bitch.

707
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,600
What?

708
01:14:45,331 --> 01:14:47,092
You made her my sister.

709
01:14:53,297 --> 01:14:54,819
I loved her, Dad.

710
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:59,105
She loves you too...

711
01:15:01,027 --> 01:15:02,627
So very much.

712
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,350
She does.

713
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:24,890
Mother, shut up.

714
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:27,613
Hey, get back in your cage!

715
01:15:29,015 --> 01:15:30,055
Get!

716
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:36,944
Dr. Sanchez,
please report to the nurses' station.

717
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:39,626
Dr. Sanchez...

718
01:15:40,627 --> 01:15:42,350
Oh... mm.

719
01:15:45,992 --> 01:15:47,595
Ohhh.

720
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:03,171
Hey.

721
01:16:04,412 --> 01:16:05,774
I'm sorry.

722
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:10,338
She was screaming,
but Brad said just to ignore it,

723
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:12,100
that she did that all the time.

724
01:16:13,981 --> 01:16:15,302
I'm so sorry.

725
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,444
Why are you doing this now?.

726
01:18:34,646 --> 01:18:36,250
Are you afraid?

727
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:54,587
Ooh.

728
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:58,110
This is too fucking weird.

729
01:18:59,512 --> 01:19:00,953
Just wait.

730
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,841
Wait.

731
01:19:09,804 --> 01:19:13,405
Pshew. Okay.

732
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:15,929
Ow. What are you--

733
01:19:16,009 --> 01:19:18,452
- All right, that's it.
- No, no. Stop it.

734
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:19,814
Aw, God!

735
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,443
Why did you
want to come here?

736
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:52,846
Mm, mm, babe...

737
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:55,409
No one dares
come near the Castle Borski.

738
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:04,819
Yeah.

739
01:20:09,465 --> 01:20:10,826
Mm.

740
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,028
Yeah.

741
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:23,880
Ohh...

742
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:26,842
Mmm.

743
01:20:27,882 --> 01:20:31,327
Yeah. You see
what we've been missing?

744
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,215
We... always knew
it'd play out this way eventually,

745
01:20:39,295 --> 01:20:40,417
didn't we?

746
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:46,063
Ever since we were little kids.

747
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:16,734
Unh!

748
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:30,306
Aah!

749
01:21:36,994 --> 01:21:37,996
Unh!

750
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:43,282
Uh, aah! Aah!

751
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:51,009
Where--?

752
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:03,462
If you would be
good enough to tell me where you're going.

753
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:07,867
Mother, get her!

754
01:22:25,965 --> 01:22:27,605
Drop it.

755
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:33,212
No! No!

756
01:22:53,953 --> 01:22:55,194
Wait.

757
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:57,597
Don't-- don't leave me.

758
01:24:52,956 --> 01:24:55,998
...life... from non-life.

759
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:58,882
These evolutionists
will try to persuade you...

760
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:13,458
These evolutionists
will try to tell you...
