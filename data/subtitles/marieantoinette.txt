1
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,980
<i>Friendship between
Austria and France...</i>

2
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:38,400
<i>...must be cemented
by marriage.</i>

3
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:43,046
<i>My youngest daughter,
Antoine...</i>

4
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,572
<i>...will be queen of France.</i>

5
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,418
Mops.

6
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,745
The court of France
is not like Vienna.

7
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,115
Listen closely to
Ambassador Mercy's council.

8
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,536
All eyes will be on you.

9
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,415
Look.

10
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,584
Do you like him?

11
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,795
He has kind eyes.

12
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,463
He's definitely very French.

13
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,625
- Three. Four.
- Six.

14
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,504
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

15
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,463
We have arrived at Schüttern
for the official handover.

16
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:06,540
Then you will be presented to the king
and to your fiancé, Louis Auguste.

17
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:17,259
Your Royal Highness, may I present
your mistress of the household...

18
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,718
...Comtesse de Noailles.

19
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,012
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,605
Madame.

21
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:44,074
This structure for the
handover ceremony...

22
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:48,745
...has been built precisely astride
the borders of the two great lands.

23
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,581
You have entered
on Austrian soil...

24
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:56,461
...you will exit on French as
the dauphine of France.

25
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,923
Now you must bid farewell
to your party...

26
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,841
...and leave all of
Austria behind.

27
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,600
Goodbye.

28
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,949
Mops.

29
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,538
You can have as many
French dogs as you like.

30
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,800
It is a custom...

31
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:54,973
...that the bride retain nothing
belonging to a foreign court.

32
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,018
An etiquette always observed
on such an occasion.

33
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,413
You're lucky.
Apparently she's quite beautiful.

34
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,960
I'll probably end up with someone
who looks like a dog.

35
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,546
- Or a horse.
- Or a horse.

36
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,048
I've heard she's really nice.

37
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,301
- Think they got rabbits here?
- Maybe.

38
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,722
Come on.

39
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,311
You notice anything strange
about me lately?

40
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,606
It's so muddy here.

41
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:39,491
I know. My stomach
feels a little bit sick.

42
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:42,986
Are you feeling better now?
Are you feeling better, Camille?

43
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:47,158
- I wonder if our little doggie is sick.
- Feel a little sickly.

44
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,991
Now.

45
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,996
Oh, my goodness, it's so
uncomfortable underfoot.

46
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,956
Come on.

47
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,212
There we are.

48
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,365
How is her bosom?

49
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,783
I have not looked at the archduchess's
bosom, Your Majesty.

50
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:38,538
Oh, didn't you?
It's the first thing I look at.

51
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:07,315
The Duc de Choiseul.

52
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,282
The foreign minister who was
instrumental in this union.

53
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:14,614
I shall never forget that you were
responsible for my happiness.

54
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,905
And that of France.

55
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,658
Please.

56
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:34,755
Here comes the Austrian.

57
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:39,008
I hope you like apple strudel.

58
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:50,269
May I present Madame la Dauphine,
Marie Antoinette.

59
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,274
My dear grandfather king.

60
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,402
Welcome, madame.

61
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:16,126
Let me present my grandson,
Louis Auguste.

62
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:29,971
Welcome, madame.

63
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:53,326
She looks like a child.

64
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,144
Hello.

65
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:10,731
Thank you.

66
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:14,902
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, madame.

67
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,866
Thanks.

68
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,052
Hello.

69
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,179
Amen.

70
00:20:57,224 --> 00:21:00,561
To the dauphin and
dauphine of France.

71
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,898
May you have many
healthy children...

72
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:07,317
...and produce an
heir to our throne.

73
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:29,393
Good luck.

74
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:32,311
And good work.

75
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,951
Apparently, nothing happened,
Your Majesty.

76
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,826
Nothing?

77
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,250
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

78
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,211
Oh, dear.

79
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,474
Madame...

80
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,809
...at the morning
dressing ceremony...

81
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,230
...rights of entry are given to
members of the high court.

82
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:23,483
Major rights to princesses of the blood
and mistresses of the household...

83
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:29,029
...while minor rights to
the valets and charges.

84
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:41,666
Anyone with rights of entry
may enter at any time...

85
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,615
...so you must pay attention,

86
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:48,376
to acknowledging properly
each arrival.

87
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:51,844
And you must not
reach for anything...

88
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:55,429
...for the handing of an item to the
dauphine is a guarded privilege.

89
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,388
Must go to the highest
rank in the room.

90
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,472
For example,
the Princesse de Lamballe...

91
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:02,602
...is a princess of the
blood by marriage.

92
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,772
Madame.

93
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:20,035
Thank you.

94
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:25,123
- It's cold.
- Yes.

95
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,625
Good morning.

96
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:33,047
So now the position must
go to the Duchess of Char...

97
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:36,467
...because she is also
a princess of the blood.

98
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:50,769
Hello.

99
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,817
So now, as a member
of the royal family...

100
00:24:54,942 --> 00:24:58,695
...your sister-in-law, the Comtesse de
Provence, must have the honor.

101
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,180
This is ridiculous.

102
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:31,642
This, madame, is Versailles.

103
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:07,354
So I've heard you make
keys as a hobby?

104
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:08,938
Yes.

105
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:16,613
And you enjoy making keys?

106
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,365
Obviously.

107
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:01,653
She had to let her servants go.
My maid knows the cook.

108
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,782
You know everyone.

109
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:10,661
Comtesse de Noailles
looks very out of sorts.

110
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,747
I think her husband's been
causing a little problem lately...

111
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:17,626
...spending far too much
time with his stable boys.

112
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,836
Too much.

113
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:23,464
Marie Antoinette looks
very pretty tonight.

114
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:26,173
Yes.

115
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:30,556
Darling, a new life,
unfortunately.

116
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:35,349
When you think about it,
this poor Marie Antoinette.

117
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,852
So young, so...

118
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,565
I think she should go
back to her country.

119
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:44,942
Look at her, so disgusting.

120
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:48,362
The comtesse is looking rather
dour this evening, don't you think?

121
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,698
Always dour.
Always tragic.

122
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:53,490
Can't believe they've brought
those ghastly aunts out again.

123
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,785
Where have they been
hiding them all these years?

124
00:28:57,244 --> 00:29:00,790
Oh, really?
This is shocking.

125
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
What is she...?

126
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,880
It's so awful, I can't...
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:11,217
Who is she?

128
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:19,057
That lady is here to give
pleasure to the king.

129
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,605
That's du Barry,
the king's mistress.

130
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,565
She wouldn't be
allowed at court...

131
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,608
...but the king did some maneuvering
to secure her a title.

132
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:33,944
The one thing I've learned
about girls from the gutter...

133
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,614
...is they know their jewels.

134
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:38,325
No way are those fake.

135
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,867
You see that?

136
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:43,954
Is this the way people
are treating me?

137
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,332
To the stocks.

138
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:48,750
Nobody treats me
like a lady here.

139
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,670
Now she's staring at me.
It's so awful.

140
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:55,215
- She should not be sitting at this table.
- I'll have one of...

141
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:00,844
Did you hear that?

142
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,980
- She just burped.
- Out of the whorehouse, darling.

143
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:08,977
- I don't know who you're referring to.
- Everyone at this table is for sale.

144
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,520
- Curls.
- What a little tart.

145
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:13,981
Well, she's not the only one at this
table, darling. Take a look around.

146
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:17,317
Look at this beautiful
Marie Antoinette. I look like her?

147
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,695
- Don't you think so?
- A long time ago.

148
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:23,051
Oh, you exaggerate.
She has blue eyes like me.

149
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:26,286
I suppose she's rather sweet.
For an Austrian.

150
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:29,203
I think she's delightful.
She looks like a piece of cake.

151
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,124
Be interesting to see
how long she lasts.

152
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,094
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.

153
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,265
How is your grandson,
the dauphin?

154
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:53,183
He's off hunting the stag.

155
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,445
<i>She doesn't seem the
least bit interested in him.</i>

156
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,942
<i>She is Austrian. They're not
exactly the warmest people.</i>

157
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:05,403
<i>But it's true. Her brother Joseph
is so cold. He's an awful man.</i>

158
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:09,576
<i>They say in Austria,
that she was with child...</i>

159
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:18,415
What a hunt today.

160
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:25,588
I'm exhausted.

161
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,138
Would you like some meat?

162
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,647
<i>Your Royal Highness...</i>

163
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:34,700
...handing out cold meats
to a hunting party...

164
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:37,737
...is not the most becoming conduct
for a future queen of France.

165
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:41,074
I was just trying to be a nice
wife for the dauphin's hunt.

166
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,450
Surely there's
no harm in that.

167
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,496
And I received a letter from your
mother warning you not to ride...

168
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,998
...as this is one of the leading
causes of miscarriages.

169
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:53,294
Well, as everyone knows,
there's no danger of that.

170
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:55,503
And it's not my fault.

171
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:59,758
Do you realize the consequences of
an unconsummated royal marriage?

172
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,844
That it could be annulled?

173
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:05,262
Your mother has asked that you
take this matter very seriously.

174
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:09,016
And do everything
in your power...

175
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,352
...to inspire the dauphin.

176
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,021
I'll do what I can.

177
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:19,358
Of course I want to please
the dauphin and my mother.

178
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,903
You'll have no influence over the king
and dauphin without a pregnancy.

179
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:25,823
Madame, you have
the alliance to consider.

180
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:29,367
Letting everyone down would
be my greatest unhappiness.

181
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:34,038
I am pleased madame
is taking this seriously.

182
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,044
Oh, is Mops on his way?

183
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:42,297
I'm working on it...

184
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,300
...but Your Royal Highness has more
pressing matters to attend to.

185
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:53,640
Oh, and I received this
letter from your mother.

186
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:04,901
<i>Dearest Antoinette:</i>

187
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:10,175
<i>It is clear that the heart of
your problems in your new home...</i>

188
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,327
<i>...is your inability to inspire
sexual passion in your husband.</i>

189
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:20,246
<i>There is no reason a girl
with so many charms as you...</i>

190
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,166
<i>...should be in this situation.</i>

191
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,092
<i>Remember, you represent
the future...</i>

192
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:30,673
<i>...and nothing is certain
about your place there...</i>

193
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:36,304
<i>...until the final physical act to
crown the Franco-Austrian alliance...</i>

194
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,514
<i>...is performed.</i>

195
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,965
It's cold.

196
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,260
It is a bit chilly.
Shall I get you a blanket?

197
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,387
No. It's okay.

198
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:32,606
Are those your feet?
They're like icicles.

199
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,403
Well...

200
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:45,407
...sleep well.

201
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,329
Thank you.

202
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,375
- Night.
- Good night.

203
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,293
Your hair always
looks so pretty.

204
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:45,463
- Oh, do you think so?
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

205
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:48,382
- It's not what I'm used to. It is.
- It's so nice to be blond.

206
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,298
- Have you been to see Léonard?
- No.

207
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:52,469
My head is in agony.

208
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:55,722
- This morning, I think, you know...
- Did he pull it?

209
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,474
Léonard must've been
in a bad mood...

210
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:00,474
...because he was pulling
my hair so hard.

211
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:04,773
And I want to tell him, you know, it's
not my fault if he's had a bad morning.

212
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,275
Don't take it
out on my scalp.

213
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:16,659
That was unnecessary.

214
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,159
Watch it.

215
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,762
I would love to go to
the opera in Paris.

216
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,809
Why go to the opera when we
can listen to the comtesse here?

217
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,393
Must she sing all night?

218
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:52,858
Can't you do something
about your wife?

219
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:58,989
Madame, shall we retire
to make love all night?

220
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:03,034
Four times last night
wasn't enough.

221
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,215
Dear Antoinette:

222
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:25,385
I am extremely concerned
with your situation.

223
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:32,226
Fortunately, the king doesn't show
preference for your sister-in-law.

224
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:37,773
But what if she
becomes pregnant?

225
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:41,076
<i>Also, I have heard...</i>

226
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,487
<i>...that you are not making
invitations to Madame du Barry.</i>

227
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,954
<i>Snubbing the king's favorite,
in your position...</i>

228
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:57,871
<i>...is extremely unwise.</i>

229
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,378
- Du Barry is dreadful.
- Dreadful.

230
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:05,173
The way she dresses.
She thinks she is the queen.

231
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:08,842
Yes, she does.
And those ridiculous pet monkeys.

232
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:10,094
Where does she come from?

233
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,597
From every bed in Paris.

234
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:16,141
You know, we didn't think she'd last
long until she married the comte...

235
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:18,851
...and then he was conveniently
shipped away somewhere.

236
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,519
She doesn't stay
in the boudoir.

237
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:21,853
- She's political.
- Very.

238
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,358
And extremely anti-Choiseul.

239
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,025
And I don't want
to say this...

240
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:28,943
...but I don't think that she has
greeted you with respect.

241
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,737
That's just my opinion.

242
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:33,657
Ambassador Mercy says
I must pay her a visit.

243
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,286
Well, if we invited you to
tea at the last minute...

244
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,869
...you wouldn't be able to,
would you?

245
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:45,878
She died giving birth
to her tenth child.

246
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,253
What a pity.
What a pity.

247
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:51,047
- There was blood all over...
- Here comes our little Austrian.

248
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,465
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Good afternoon.

249
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,137
Good afternoon.
You look lovely.

250
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:57,137
Oh, thank you.
So do you.

251
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,554
Thank you.

252
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:01,474
Look at du Barry.
What is she wearing now?

253
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,976
Another one of her
exotic fantasies?

254
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,813
She can't pass a mirror
without seducing it.

255
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:09,523
Do you think she's wearing
enough jewelry?

256
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:12,025
Never enough for du Barry.

257
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,237
She's coming.

258
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:18,157
Oh, I love your shoes, Victoire.

259
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,782
Oh, why, thank you.
I got them from Christian in Paris.

260
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:24,121
- Oh, I must call on him.
- Yes, you must. He's wonderful.

261
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:20,215
Madame du Barry would like
to offer you some diamonds.

262
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:23,465
I have enough diamonds.

263
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,719
Snubbing the king's favorite is publicly
criticizing the king's behavior.

264
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,887
All you need do is say
a few words to her.

265
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:32,307
Because of rank she is not
allowed to speak first.

266
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:34,309
I certainly have nothing
to say to her.

267
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,894
Why should I approve of his
cavorting with a harlot?

268
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:39,728
- Your Royal Highness.
- Well, that's what she is.

269
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:43,150
Everyone knows she's from a brothel
and that title was bought for her.

270
00:41:43,277 --> 00:41:46,278
Your mother and I
are very concerned.

271
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:49,905
Du Barry has been complaining to the
king that you will not address her.

272
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,534
And you cannot afford to fall
out of favor with the king.

273
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:54,827
Especially as your marriage...

274
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:57,871
...not exactly on solid ground.

275
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:01,708
Fine.
I'll talk to her.

276
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:27,065
There are a lot of people
at Versailles today.

277
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:29,775
Yes, there are.

278
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:02,389
Those are my last
words to that woman.

279
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,822
The first mechanical locks
were made of wood.

280
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:33,541
Records show them in use
some 4000 years ago in Egypt.

281
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:17,791
Any good fans?
That one's pretty.

282
00:44:17,873 --> 00:44:19,666
- Evening or daytime?
- I like lace.

283
00:44:21,295 --> 00:44:23,920
These are so du Barry.

284
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,009
- Do you like these for hair?
- It's beautiful.

285
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,177
- You don't think it's too much?
- Maybe one.

286
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:32,471
- One feather?
- Yeah.

287
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:33,804
Or in white?

288
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:36,434
Can we get these
in white, maybe?

289
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,101
I don't know if I like that one.

290
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,146
I love these.

291
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,981
Do you want these too?

292
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:44,565
Yeah, but in pink.

293
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,693
Oh, okay.
Two in pink.

294
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,695
Has madame read the brief
on our current situation?

295
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,114
No, I haven't read it yet.

296
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,742
Can you just tell me about it?

297
00:44:57,201 --> 00:45:02,289
Well, the reforms in Poland by King
Poniatowski have led to civil war.

298
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:05,833
The Russians and the Austrians
have taken over a third of Poland...

299
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,835
...which is, of course,
distressing...

300
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:11,172
...as Poland is a friend
and ally of France.

301
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:17,094
Which sleeve do you like?
With ruffles or without?

302
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:20,224
Have you been paying
any attention?

303
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:24,393
Your mother is relying on you
to smooth over this crisis.

304
00:45:24,518 --> 00:45:27,438
Where will I be if there's a rupture
between our two families?

305
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,900
Am I to be Austrian or
the dauphine of France?

306
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:35,652
You must be both.

307
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:43,577
<i>- Well, I heard that
she bought a boy. - No.</i>

308
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:47,329
<i>Yes, I heard. She found a peasant
boy by the side of the street...</i>

309
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:49,541
<i>...and took him in
like a stray dog.</i>

310
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,335
Well, it's not as if she
can have one of her own.

311
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,547
Maybe if she spent less
time with Lamballe...

312
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:56,797
...and more time
with her husband...

313
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,217
...there wouldn't be a problem.

314
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,184
Well, let's not forget
she is an Austrian spy.

315
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:05,681
And I can't imagine that's
very warm in the bedroom.

316
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:10,393
Come, my little truffle cake.

317
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,061
I'm going to ravage you.

318
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,400
- Will you come back right away?
- Yes, my sweet.

319
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:20,485
Just a quick hunting excursion,
we'll be back straightaway.

320
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:24,007
I will be humiliated before
the court and the public...

321
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,492
...if your brother's new wife
becomes pregnant before I do.

322
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:31,329
When I return from Saint-Cloud,
you can be sure...

323
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:33,414
...that I will resume my regime.

324
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:38,003
And hopefully everything
will go swimmingly.

325
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:20,541
I have absolutely no intention of
breaking the alliance with Austria.

326
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:23,126
I am very relieved to hear that,
Your Majesty.

327
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:25,961
But what on earth is going on
with that young couple?

328
00:47:26,045 --> 00:47:27,963
It's a disaster.

329
00:47:28,672 --> 00:47:32,427
Send for Dr. Lassonne
to visit them.

330
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:34,510
Yes, of course.

331
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:40,226
Do you find your
body responsive?

332
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,726
What?

333
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,771
Do you find your
body responsive?

334
00:47:53,277 --> 00:47:56,405
What do you eat
for breakfast?

335
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:58,262
Hot chocolate.

336
00:47:58,398 --> 00:48:00,351
Hot chocolate.

337
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,943
Hello?

338
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:38,737
Hello, Yolande.

339
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:43,199
How lovely to see you.

340
00:48:43,449 --> 00:48:46,869
Yes. This is the
Duchesse de Polignac.

341
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:48,536
- Hello.
- Your Majesty.

342
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:50,621
- We haven't seen you for a while.
- I know.

343
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:54,585
I've been in St. Petersburg,
where I met Dimitri.

344
00:48:56,043 --> 00:49:00,130
Isn't he divine? Have you
ever been with a Russian?

345
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:02,300
- No, I...
- They're so bossy.

346
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:07,096
Look how fat the marquis's gotten.
Hope he doesn't break the chair.

347
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,306
Is he still sleeping with Camille?

348
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:13,476
Anyway, I must be off.
It was lovely to meet you.

349
00:49:53,262 --> 00:49:54,639
Quiet.

350
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:57,559
Applause is not usually permitted
at court performances.

351
00:49:57,684 --> 00:50:01,018
Why not?
It was wonderful.

352
00:50:01,853 --> 00:50:03,271
Clap, clap.

353
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:05,273
Clap.

354
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,347
<i>Dearest Antoinette:</i>

355
00:51:28,472 --> 00:51:33,353
<i>I'm pleased to tell you how wonderful
your brothers and sisters are doing...</i>

356
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,148
<i>...in their marriages.</i>

357
00:51:35,273 --> 00:51:38,190
<i>Maria Carolina is pregnant...</i>

358
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:41,402
<i>...expecting her
first child in June.</i>

359
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:44,530
<i>And Ferdinand is enchanted
with Beatrice...</i>

360
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:47,831
<i>...having made her
his wife at once.</i>

361
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:52,335
<i>All this news, which should
fill me with contentment...</i>

362
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:57,958
<i>...is diminished by reflections
on your dangerous situation.</i>

363
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:00,378
<i>Everything depends
on the wife...</i>

364
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:03,715
<i>...if she is willing and sweet.</i>

365
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:05,717
<i>I can't repeat enough...</i>

366
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,222
<i>...the importance for you to
employ charm and patience...</i>

367
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:15,577
<i>...never ill humor, to remedy
this unfortunate situation.</i>

368
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:19,896
<i>Remember, nothing is certain
about your place there...</i>

369
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:23,315
<i>...until an heir is produced.</i>

370
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,965
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

371
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,528
I'm sorry.

372
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,364
That's all right.

373
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:19,617
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

374
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:26,206
- Good night.
- Good night.

375
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,235
Your Majesties are requested at the
delivery of Comtesse de Provence.

376
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:11,956
Bravo, bravo.

377
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,710
- Oh, wonderful!
- It's a healthy baby boy.

378
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,253
Oh, my God.
How happy I am.

379
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:25,092
Let me see my nephew.
The new Duc d'Angoulęme.

380
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,637
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

381
00:54:28,847 --> 00:54:32,099
It's the first Bourbon
prince of his generation.

382
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:34,684
He's so beautiful.

383
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:39,065
It's barren.
What do you expect?

384
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:42,610
When will you
give us an heir?

385
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:45,612
I hear she's frigid.

386
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:13,525
I like the pink.
It's like candy.

387
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:27,079
This is wonderful.

388
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,789
I love this.

389
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:32,208
Oh, it's a classic.

390
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:45,971
Could we get some
more champagne?

391
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,436
Monsieur Léonard.

392
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:58,121
Ravishing.

393
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:03,208
Oh, Léonard.

394
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,210
You're the best.

395
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:08,713
- It's not too much, is it?
- No.

396
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,072
We should all go to Paris
for the masked ball.

397
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,324
We're not allowed to go
without a formal reception.

398
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:43,244
Well, if it's a masked ball...

399
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,164
...no one would have to know,
would they?

400
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,840
Sorry.

401
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:26,117
Which way?

402
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,371
Come on.

403
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:07,905
Excuse me.

404
01:00:08,322 --> 01:00:09,657
Excuse me.

405
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:39,684
Where do you come from,
monsieur?

406
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,476
Versailles.

407
01:00:43,688 --> 01:00:48,690
And has the dauphin
done the deed yet?

408
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:50,943
What?

409
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:54,197
Has the dauphin deflowered
the dauphine?

410
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,574
- Excuse me? - I'd love to
do the honors, you know.

411
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:28,601
Doesn't interest me.
Cheers.

412
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:45,284
Look at that sword.

413
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:48,204
I'd like to see what
he could do with that.

414
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,833
Oh, who's he talking to?

415
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,335
Hideous dress
she's wearing.

416
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:05,512
Pretend you're having
a really good time.

417
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:08,764
Have fun.

418
01:02:11,268 --> 01:02:15,603
- Do I know you?
- No. I don't think so.

419
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:20,525
Are you making any
progress with her?

420
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:23,027
Possibly.

421
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:26,449
Are you going to tell
me who you are?

422
01:02:29,784 --> 01:02:31,452
Are you?

423
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:34,288
Count Fersen of
the Swedish army.

424
01:02:35,873 --> 01:02:37,208
Count Fersen.

425
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,715
That's the dauphine.

426
01:03:05,775 --> 01:03:07,985
We must go. It's half past
three in the morning.

427
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:09,820
No. Let's just stay
a little longer.

428
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,449
- Oh, please. Let's go. Come on.
- Please, please.

429
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:13,822
Finally.

430
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,954
Do you know of
Count Fersen?

431
01:03:21,081 --> 01:03:23,708
Yes!
Count Fersen, of course.

432
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,918
Beatrice de la Falaise was
with him last summer.

433
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:27,753
He's got quite a reputation,
you know.

434
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:30,672
Comtesse de Sevigny.
She was with him too.

435
01:05:16,436 --> 01:05:18,188
Good morning.

436
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:22,273
- What is it?
- The king has fallen ill.

437
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:23,690
Is it serious?

438
01:05:23,817 --> 01:05:25,193
Smallpox.

439
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:29,447
He doesn't have long.

440
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:35,202
You know, we cannot take his
confession while he has a mistress.

441
01:05:38,954 --> 01:05:41,458
It will be taken care of.

442
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,126
Madame du Barry...

443
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:48,838
...I'm sick and know
what I have to do.

444
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,469
<i>Rest assured...</i>

445
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:55,096
<i>...I shall always...</i>

446
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:59,266
<i>...have the most tender
feelings of friendship for you.</i>

447
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,672
Bring me du Barry.

448
01:06:33,465 --> 01:06:36,090
She is gone, Your Majesty.

449
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:55,693
The king is dead.
Long live Louis XVI.

450
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,992
Your Majesties,
I am at your loyal service.

451
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:21,715
Dear God, guide us and protect us.
We are too young to reign.

452
01:07:27,387 --> 01:07:32,057
May God crown you
with a crown of glory.

453
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:24,606
How marvelous.

454
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,859
Here are two for
me and the queen.

455
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:29,820
Happy birthday, darling!

456
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:39,119
One, two, three.

457
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:42,206
Happy birthday!

458
01:08:51,797 --> 01:08:55,551
Happy birthday, darling.
Eighteen. Happy birthday.

459
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,890
Big stakes!
Come on now!

460
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:05,976
That one.

461
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:07,645
That one's for me.

462
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:10,983
What's coming?

463
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:17,988
Amazing.

464
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,417
Here are two.

465
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,252
So pretty!

466
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,181
Oh, Léonard.

467
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:48,768
Thank you.

468
01:09:51,976 --> 01:09:53,936
Okay, come round
to the salon.

469
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:55,855
Speak to le beau Julian.

470
01:09:56,146 --> 01:09:59,277
- First. And then you'll see me.
- Marvelous!

471
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:01,153
I've heard he
likes men as well.

472
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:03,447
No. No.
It's not true.

473
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:05,947
Do you want some cherry?

474
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:11,453
I love your hair.
What's going on there?

475
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:13,122
Everything.

476
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:16,041
- It's fantastic.
- It's full of secrets.

477
01:10:25,634 --> 01:10:27,425
You're winning, I hope.

478
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,471
Madame, it's quite late.

479
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:34,100
I think it's time for the
dealers to return to Paris.

480
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:37,309
You said we could play but you
never specified for how long.

481
01:10:37,344 --> 01:10:40,145
- You're worthless.
- I won again!

482
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:43,818
- Give me my chips.
- How'd you get so good at this?

483
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:45,778
- Good night.
- Oh, no. Don't go to sleep.

484
01:10:45,903 --> 01:10:49,112
We're gonna watch the sunrise.
Don't you want to see that?

485
01:10:49,146 --> 01:10:51,198
I'd rather get some
much-needed sleep.

486
01:10:51,408 --> 01:10:53,827
Have you ever
watched the sunrise?

487
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:56,077
When I rise early for
the hunt, my dear.

488
01:10:56,328 --> 01:10:58,078
- That doesn't count.
- It's your turn.

489
01:10:58,162 --> 01:11:00,916
Try not to lose
our whole fortune.

490
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,418
On a roll.

491
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:09,005
I'm taking off.

492
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,842
That's impressive.
That is very impressive.

493
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,014
Wait! Wait! Wait!

494
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,765
Spin with me!

495
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,768
Wait!

496
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:26,521
Come along.

497
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,533
Come on. Come on, people.
Move, move, move.

498
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:59,802
Isn't that the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

499
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:07,310
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

500
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:09,729
- Cheers. For the birthday girl.
- Happy birthday.

501
01:12:10,228 --> 01:12:11,813
To the new day.

502
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:14,398
And the next one.

503
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:17,234
I think I have a fly
in my champagne.

504
01:13:59,078 --> 01:14:02,912
I would like to plant oaks
all along these paths.

505
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:04,707
How long will that take?

506
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:10,337
It will take two weeks to get them,
but they will be quite small.

507
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:14,632
What if I want
them that size?

508
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,511
It will take at least
three years.

509
01:14:17,636 --> 01:14:19,012
- Three years?
- Yes.

510
01:14:19,095 --> 01:14:21,096
Well, can't they bring
in bigger ones?

511
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,057
Well, I can see.

512
01:14:27,645 --> 01:14:32,230
Your Majesty, you have spent
over 50,000 already this month.

513
01:14:32,774 --> 01:14:35,359
There is nothing left
to go to your charities.

514
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:38,279
Your Majesty? Léonard is
here to fit your new wigs.

515
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:41,407
All right.
I'll get the small trees.

516
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:44,534
And I'll ask Louis for the money
for the Young Mothers' Fund.

517
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:55,878
The Americans are asking
for help in their revolution.

518
01:14:57,047 --> 01:14:59,882
Well, I can't exactly
see assisting those...

519
01:14:59,966 --> 01:15:02,385
...who are rejecting
their sovereign.

520
01:15:02,592 --> 01:15:05,887
But it would make a strong
statement to England.

521
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,306
Can our finances
take the strain?

522
01:15:08,515 --> 01:15:11,019
Oh, taxes will be
raised slightly.

523
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:14,145
I recommend we help
our American brothers...

524
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:17,480
...and show the rest of
Europe our strength.

525
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:24,154
All right, then.
Send funds to America.

526
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,926
Madame, your brother, the emperor,
is in the salon waiting for you.

527
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:50,345
He's here?
Thank you.

528
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,314
Have you come
to take me home?

529
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,859
Unfortunately, I can't
kidnap the queen of France.

530
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,534
Is your hair quite
tall enough today?

531
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:12,199
Maybe you can keep a
pet in there or something.

532
01:16:14,827 --> 01:16:17,661
The emperor of China
sent me this tea.

533
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,289
Watch the flower.

534
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,336
Isn't it divine?

535
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,296
Yes.

536
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,886
It's jasmine.

537
01:16:47,898 --> 01:16:52,902
As your brother, I have to lecture
you about your constant gambling...

538
01:16:52,936 --> 01:16:56,823
...and choice of friends,
like the Duchesse de Polignac.

539
01:16:56,948 --> 01:16:59,865
Do you think she's the proper
lady-in-waiting for a queen?

540
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,659
But she's fun.
She makes me laugh.

541
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:04,246
And your constant parties.

542
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,083
I mean, they can hardly leave
you enough time to spend...

543
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:09,582
...alone with your husband.

544
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,752
I'm sure our mother
has worried you.

545
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:15,506
Yes.
Well, of course she has.

546
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,095
I think I'm gonna
talk to young Louis.

547
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,278
Magnificent.

548
01:17:44,908 --> 01:17:48,368
We have a female elephant
in our Austrian menagerie.

549
01:17:48,953 --> 01:17:51,788
Well, perhaps we could
arrange a marriage.

550
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:57,836
So...

551
01:17:58,045 --> 01:18:01,797
...I thought we could have a little
talk about the marriage bed.

552
01:18:04,009 --> 01:18:06,176
The doctor said I was fit.

553
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:07,970
Good.

554
01:18:08,054 --> 01:18:10,265
What goes on exactly?

555
01:18:17,561 --> 01:18:21,067
I understand you have a
certain passion for locks.

556
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:22,532
Yes.

557
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:25,903
Well, sometimes when
a key doesn't quite fit...

558
01:18:25,987 --> 01:18:29,323
<i>The problem is only that
the king and queen of France...</i>

559
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:31,618
<i>...are complete blunderers.</i>

560
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:35,578
<i>There's nothing really
wrong with Louis XVI.</i>

561
01:18:35,613 --> 01:18:39,422
<i>Everything works,
just not at the right time.</i>

562
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:44,837
<i>I think after our conversation,
the great work will be accomplished.</i>

563
01:19:29,795 --> 01:19:31,462
Very warm in here.

564
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,048
I can't even believe
she's getting enough air.

565
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:52,233
Is it a boy?

566
01:19:54,402 --> 01:19:55,734
It's a girl, look.

567
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:58,487
She's unconscious.
We must get her air.

568
01:19:58,695 --> 01:20:00,448
Please, the queen needs air.

569
01:20:00,572 --> 01:20:03,908
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

570
01:20:03,993 --> 01:20:06,703
Get back. Back.
Get back, please.

571
01:20:06,828 --> 01:20:08,578
Everybody, please.

572
01:20:08,913 --> 01:20:10,332
Get back.

573
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,927
Oh, he's beautiful.

574
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:29,765
You are adorable.

575
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:32,144
It's a girl.

576
01:20:36,604 --> 01:20:38,899
Poor little girl.

577
01:20:39,024 --> 01:20:44,570
You are not what was desired,
but you are no less dear to me.

578
01:20:46,197 --> 01:20:49,033
A boy would be
the son of France...

579
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:53,204
...but you, Marie Thérčse,
shall be mine.

580
01:20:54,872 --> 01:20:56,332
Come look.

581
01:20:57,666 --> 01:21:00,086
Oh, she's so small.

582
01:21:01,045 --> 01:21:02,463
Look at her hands.

583
01:21:14,349 --> 01:21:16,141
I would like to
feed her myself.

584
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:18,728
But, madame,
we have the nurse for that.

585
01:21:19,395 --> 01:21:22,813
And you know, it's not a good
idea in your fragile condition.

586
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:26,777
Madame.

587
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:38,162
May I present you with your
new retreat, the Petit Trianon.

588
01:21:40,538 --> 01:21:41,789
Thank you.

589
01:22:59,234 --> 01:23:04,073
I want something
more simple. Natural.

590
01:23:04,573 --> 01:23:06,367
<i>To wear in the garden.</i>

591
01:23:19,587 --> 01:23:23,131
Are you getting food for the little lamb?
Let's feed the lamb.

592
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:24,925
Marie Thérčse, come here.

593
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:29,679
You do it. You do it.
You feed the lamb.

594
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,180
You feed the lamb.

595
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:40,939
Little lamby.

596
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:02,750
Beautiful.

597
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,796
What is this?
It's an egg.

598
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:10,550
Welcome to my little village.
I love it here.

599
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:13,094
- Really special.
- It's my heaven.

600
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,806
- Hello.
- Sweet.

601
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:20,393
Oh, look, the chickens
are out. Fabulous.

602
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,560
Oh, the lilies look
so beautiful.

603
01:24:22,769 --> 01:24:25,445
- It's heavenly.
- Hello.

604
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,984
Come on, you little chickens.
Come on, little chickens!

605
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:30,275
Oh, look at those little things.
Hello!

606
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:31,944
That one's named after me.

607
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:36,240
Oh, this is my favorite, all the
fresh herbs. They smell so good.

608
01:24:36,324 --> 01:24:39,661
You've got to brush the dirt off a bit,
but they're quite clean after that.

609
01:24:40,578 --> 01:24:44,247
Oh, we must do this more often.
I love the country.

610
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,252
Where'd you get this from?

611
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:54,047
- Wait till you try this milk.
- Oh, what beautiful porcelain.

612
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,966
- How lovely.
- That one's very good.

613
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,845
One of these.

614
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,265
You must try the milk.

615
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,725
Thank you.

616
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,606
Rousseau says:

617
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:16,694
"If we assume man has been
corrupted by an artificial civilization...

618
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:18,945
<i>...what is the natural state?</i>

619
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:22,408
<i>The state of nature from
which he has been removed?</i>

620
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:28,037
<i>Imagine wandering up
and down the forest...</i>

621
01:25:28,162 --> 01:25:32,000
<i>...without industry,
without speech...</i>

622
01:25:32,034 --> 01:25:33,876
<i>...and without home. "</i>

623
01:25:53,478 --> 01:25:56,604
Let's get a blue flower.

624
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:03,694
Beautiful.

625
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:23,679
<i>No, I think perceived austerity
must be encouraged...</i>

626
01:26:23,713 --> 01:26:28,175
...but I'm afraid the queen has a
somewhat artistic temperament...

627
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,841
...which needs nourishing.

628
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:31,301
May I speak to you?

629
01:26:31,511 --> 01:26:33,845
Yes.
Excuse me, Father.

630
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:38,435
We have not received any
invitation by the queen...

631
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,229
...which is customary
to our rank.

632
01:26:41,354 --> 01:26:45,693
I'm afraid the queen is not well
enough for formal entertaining...

633
01:26:45,818 --> 01:26:48,319
...but I will speak with her,
madame.

634
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:50,194
But...

635
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:54,365
How can we be expected
to live in a place...

636
01:26:54,573 --> 01:26:57,619
...without any certainty
of our position?

637
01:26:57,909 --> 01:26:59,287
I don't understand.

638
01:26:59,371 --> 01:27:02,789
The Duchesse de Char
was very angry.

639
01:27:02,914 --> 01:27:05,417
But this is my escape
from all the protocol.

640
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:08,838
Raumont, amongst others,
was complaining.

641
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,801
Well, we'll invite them to the
theater for my first performance.

642
01:27:14,837 --> 01:27:18,137
- We'll need an audience.
- Splendid.

643
01:28:01,177 --> 01:28:03,054
Bravo!

644
01:28:04,554 --> 01:28:05,890
Bravo!

645
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,182
Bravo!

646
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:13,104
And in the end, I don't
know how they go out.

647
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:16,189
- It's always raining there.
- Not like here. It's always raining.

648
01:28:16,314 --> 01:28:18,192
They are cheerful,
I must admit.

649
01:28:19,525 --> 01:28:20,904
There's someone to see you.

650
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,988
Oh, who?

651
01:28:29,034 --> 01:28:30,496
Good afternoon!

652
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:34,039
You've come to pay me a visit.
How gallant you are.

653
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:37,710
- Have you seen Marie Thérčse today?
- She's been married off.

654
01:28:37,793 --> 01:28:40,296
Can't we at least wait
until she's talking?

655
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:41,630
If you insist.

656
01:28:41,755 --> 01:28:45,716
Come home. We're having a ball for
the soldiers who fought in America.

657
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:47,386
I will.

658
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:53,224
I hope there are some
handsome generals.

659
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:56,143
They've been away from women
a long time, you know.

660
01:28:56,894 --> 01:28:59,561
May I also present Comte d'Estaing.

661
01:29:00,855 --> 01:29:05,403
Excellent victory on the capture
of Grenada. Excellent.

662
01:29:06,904 --> 01:29:08,654
Congratulations.

663
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:14,076
Your Majesty, may I present
Colonel Smythe.

664
01:29:15,954 --> 01:29:18,747
May I also present Count Fersen.

665
01:29:21,164 --> 01:29:22,751
Count Fersen.

666
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:25,420
Pleasure's all mine.

667
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:29,506
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

668
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:32,134
- What is this?
- It's a wild strawberry.

669
01:29:32,216 --> 01:29:33,761
Try it.
It's quite exquisite.

670
01:29:35,846 --> 01:29:39,515
Honestly! "The Marriage of Figaro".
You'd love it.

671
01:29:39,599 --> 01:29:41,810
The servants take
over the house.

672
01:29:41,935 --> 01:29:43,686
It's superb.

673
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:46,521
The women were carrying the
verses around on their fans.

674
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:49,190
Best thing I've seen for years.
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

675
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:50,568
I think we saw it together.

676
01:29:50,693 --> 01:29:52,988
It was over three hours.
Far too long for me.

677
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:55,447
- Cheers, everybody.
- To the queen.

678
01:29:55,572 --> 01:29:57,239
To our queen.

679
01:29:58,701 --> 01:30:00,784
Have a good evening.

680
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:03,078
And to Raumont for
bringing the oysters.

681
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:05,497
To Raumont for the oysters.

682
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:07,666
And to Lamballe for
bringing the flowers.

683
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:09,878
For the flowers,
beautiful flowers.

684
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:12,963
And to Fersen for coming
all the way from Sweden.

685
01:30:13,087 --> 01:30:14,338
- Yes.
- To Sweden.

686
01:30:14,421 --> 01:30:16,007
All the way from Sweden.

687
01:30:16,506 --> 01:30:19,554
That is a very long journey,
I must say.

688
01:30:19,637 --> 01:30:22,471
- How long was it?
- Took about ten days.

689
01:30:22,555 --> 01:30:24,640
Yes, ten days is
a very long time.

690
01:30:24,765 --> 01:30:27,685
Personally, I can't travel
that much myself.

691
01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:31,820
- Far too long.
- I must show you this trick.

692
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:37,068
Everybody, lick your finger and then
rub it around the rim of the glass.

693
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:39,153
Beautiful.

694
01:30:39,237 --> 01:30:41,988
- A horrible sound.
- Oh, come on. It's like angels.

695
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:45,618
- It's like angels.
- It's very pretty.

696
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,286
It is pretty, isn't it?

697
01:30:49,372 --> 01:30:52,166
It's very spiritual,
really, isn't it?

698
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,336
When was the last time
you went to Mass?

699
01:30:58,546 --> 01:31:01,048
- Of sorts.
- I haven't seen it.

700
01:31:01,172 --> 01:31:02,384
Ask another question.

701
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:04,259
- I can ask another question?
- Yeah.

702
01:31:05,094 --> 01:31:06,679
Am I a male?

703
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:08,137
- No.
- No.

704
01:31:08,974 --> 01:31:10,640
Partially.

705
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:12,935
That's terrible.

706
01:31:13,019 --> 01:31:14,394
Oh, that's so mean.

707
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:16,479
My turn, it's my turn.

708
01:31:16,689 --> 01:31:18,023
Am I a woman?

709
01:31:18,146 --> 01:31:20,356
Am I a soldier?

710
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,359
- Do I write music?
- Yes.

711
01:31:23,443 --> 01:31:24,695
Am I a vegetable?

712
01:31:24,945 --> 01:31:27,197
- Yes. Good question.
- Yes.

713
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:29,949
Am I...

714
01:31:31,493 --> 01:31:32,743
...from the ancient world?

715
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:35,538
- Am I here?
- No.

716
01:31:35,663 --> 01:31:37,039
No, thank God.

717
01:31:37,122 --> 01:31:39,123
Am I...

718
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:40,542
...present now?

719
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:42,545
- Yes.
- Yes, always.

720
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,547
- Am I...?
- You're very talented.

721
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:47,881
- Am I Alexander the Great?
- Yes.

722
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,634
Is it Mozart?

723
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,055
- You saw!
- You've seen yours.

724
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:54,974
That's the second time
I've won as well.

725
01:31:55,056 --> 01:31:57,640
- You saw that.
- There's something in the oysters.

726
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,737
Be careful, please.

727
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,766
But you should try
to visit America.

728
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,395
It's beautiful,
very different than France.

729
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:50,189
Our queen seems rather fond
of looking at Count Fersen.

730
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:53,233
Then you've not heard of the
Hasselhoff family singers?

731
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:54,693
No.

732
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:56,862
Well, he's easy on the eyes.

733
01:32:58,363 --> 01:33:00,740
But don't you think she
favors him too clearly?

734
01:33:01,574 --> 01:33:03,242
Just because it is not you?

735
01:33:03,368 --> 01:33:05,871
Don't you think it would be
unbecoming to our queen...

736
01:33:05,954 --> 01:33:08,456
...when he has quite
a reputation?

737
01:33:08,538 --> 01:33:10,750
He amuses her,
and she likes to be amused.

738
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:15,128
There's nothing unregal
in that, monsieur.

739
01:33:19,216 --> 01:33:21,801
- You must meet soldiers all the time.
- No, I don't.

740
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:23,136
You don't?

741
01:34:35,118 --> 01:34:39,372
And then he took it out.
Just like that.

742
01:34:39,456 --> 01:34:42,208
I said, "What do you think
you'll do with that, monsieur?"

743
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:44,710
Oh, good God,
don't act all innocent.

744
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:46,543
Please.

745
01:34:46,793 --> 01:34:49,381
I could have told him exactly
what to do with it.

746
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:51,134
And what is that, darling?

747
01:34:51,382 --> 01:34:53,551
Put it back in his trousers
where it belonged.

748
01:34:53,636 --> 01:34:57,220
Lamballe, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we call a prude.

749
01:34:57,256 --> 01:34:58,640
Better than a whore.

750
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:03,145
I wish I could go with you.

751
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:06,145
I should kidnap you.

752
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:37,604
Of course, you know the
one about the English letter.

753
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:42,899
Don't you want to go to Paris,
see the opera?

754
01:36:43,025 --> 01:36:44,402
Your go.

755
01:36:44,484 --> 01:36:47,197
I'm more comfortable
just to stay here.

756
01:36:47,738 --> 01:36:49,158
We have everything we need.

757
01:36:49,283 --> 01:36:52,618
I should talk to the priest.
No, that's inexcusable.

758
01:36:52,743 --> 01:36:55,661
It is. It's dangerous
for her safety.

759
01:36:55,744 --> 01:36:57,747
Goodness, a criminal
could come in here.

760
01:36:57,832 --> 01:37:00,001
- Cheat.
- Conceivably her husband.

761
01:37:00,751 --> 01:37:04,420
You know, I heard she's
not even really a duchess.

762
01:37:04,454 --> 01:37:05,755
Yeah, it's all a front.

763
01:37:05,837 --> 01:37:08,759
Her husband's a thief,
and he bought her title.

764
01:37:08,884 --> 01:37:11,094
Is that what happened?
Really?

765
01:37:11,177 --> 01:37:12,761
That's what I heard.

766
01:37:14,845 --> 01:37:17,556
- How much did that cost?
- A fortune.

767
01:37:17,591 --> 01:37:20,269
It would cost a fortune,
wouldn't it?

768
01:37:20,435 --> 01:37:23,479
To buy a title?
Yes. At the court?

769
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:28,274
She shouldn't be allowed.

770
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,694
She should buy a new dress,
is what she should buy.

771
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:33,280
She should buy a new dress,
yeah, you're right.

772
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:01,305
Vaguely.

773
01:38:02,472 --> 01:38:04,976
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

774
01:38:05,725 --> 01:38:07,560
May I be excused?

775
01:38:08,104 --> 01:38:09,896
Yes, of course, madame.

776
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:13,400
I might go and ask her.
That way she'll tell us exactly.

777
01:38:13,524 --> 01:38:15,484
Ask her about her family.

778
01:39:02,862 --> 01:39:05,448
The problem of the debt
is grave, Your Majesty.

779
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,198
The people of France
are hungry.

780
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:11,619
Sending troops to America is costing
more than what we estimated.

781
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:14,122
But we can't let England win.

782
01:39:14,706 --> 01:39:17,460
We must show our strength.

783
01:39:20,668 --> 01:39:23,588
We will continue aid
to the Americans.

784
01:39:25,381 --> 01:39:30,470
<i>And when they went to the queen
to tell her her subjects had no bread...</i>

785
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:33,055
<i>...do you know
what she said?</i>

786
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,681
Let them eat cake.

787
01:39:35,806 --> 01:39:38,810
That's such nonsense.
I would never say that.

788
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:43,399
And here you're having an
orgy with quite a big group.

789
01:39:43,434 --> 01:39:44,981
I think I'm here
sucking your toes.

790
01:39:45,067 --> 01:39:47,360
Don't they ever tire of
these ridiculous stories?

791
01:39:47,485 --> 01:39:52,573
They say you gave Thomas Jefferson
a special tour of your gardens.

792
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:56,827
Is Jefferson admiring
the royal bush?

793
01:39:58,621 --> 01:40:01,332
- Oh, that's awful.
- Can't you do something?

794
01:40:02,082 --> 01:40:04,458
I'm not going to
acknowledge it.

795
01:40:06,127 --> 01:40:08,003
The French can be fickle...

796
01:40:08,212 --> 01:40:12,507
...and Her Majesty would do
well to be more attentive.

797
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,261
Life is getting harder
for the people of France.

798
01:40:16,296 --> 01:40:18,515
The bread shortage is grave.

799
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,184
Well, there must be something the
king can do to ease their sufferings.

800
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:26,020
Tell the court jeweler to
stop sending diamonds.

801
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,939
You don't need any diamonds,
do you?

802
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:31,984
- No.
- How pretty Madame Royale is.

803
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:34,194
I'm pleased you find me so.

804
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,407
Say thank you.

805
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:41,368
She is certainly
a daughter of France.

806
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,037
Oh, I know.

807
01:40:45,538 --> 01:40:46,998
What's the matter?

808
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,375
Your mother has died.

809
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,377
I'm so sorry.

810
01:41:06,056 --> 01:41:11,060
<i>Oh, my brother, I am devastated
by the news of our mother's death.</i>

811
01:41:11,604 --> 01:41:14,698
<i>You alone are left
to me in Austria...</i>

812
01:41:14,733 --> 01:41:18,569
<i>...which is and will
always be so dear to me.</i>

813
01:41:18,693 --> 01:41:22,988
<i>Remember we are your friends,
your allies.</i>

814
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,742
<i>I embrace you.</i>

815
01:41:39,546 --> 01:41:44,759
Madame, you have fulfilled our
wishes and those of France.

816
01:41:44,793 --> 01:41:46,345
You are the mother
of a dauphin.

817
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,766
May I present the
dauphin of France.

818
01:42:10,282 --> 01:42:13,201
What a joy.
The dauphin of France.

819
01:46:37,942 --> 01:46:41,195
Hello. Why don't you hit
the ball over there?

820
01:46:41,488 --> 01:46:43,697
Come on.
You're gonna hit it.

821
01:46:50,662 --> 01:46:56,207
Your Majesty, the Bastille fortress
was stormed by an angry mob.

822
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:04,716
In view of the hatred felt for
the Duchesse de Polignac...

823
01:47:04,841 --> 01:47:06,635
...thought to be the
queen's favorite...

824
01:47:06,926 --> 01:47:10,472
...I would recommend that she
leave for the Swiss border.

825
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:15,057
I also must urge all of the princes
and princesses of the blood...

826
01:47:15,092 --> 01:47:16,519
...to leave at once.

827
01:47:16,726 --> 01:47:19,822
Yes, they must go.
I will stay.

828
01:47:19,856 --> 01:47:23,400
Certainly the royal family must
find somewhere more secure.

829
01:47:23,484 --> 01:47:26,109
Metz is one of the strongest
fortresses in Europe.

830
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:27,779
You will not be safe here.

831
01:47:27,904 --> 01:47:31,240
I will see to it that my
mistresses are off at once...

832
01:47:31,323 --> 01:47:34,033
...but my place is here
with my husband.

833
01:48:04,188 --> 01:48:05,731
Goodbye.

834
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:38,439
Your Majesty, your immediate
return is requested.

835
01:49:38,524 --> 01:49:39,859
There's a mob of hundreds...

836
01:49:40,109 --> 01:49:43,318
...on their way in demand
of flour from their sovereign.

837
01:49:48,114 --> 01:49:50,409
It would be more secure
to decamp to Rambouillet

838
01:49:50,545 --> 01:49:53,990
- twice the distance from Paris.
- I will not be a fugitive king.

839
01:49:54,072 --> 01:49:57,186
- It is too dangerous here.
- At least send the queen and children.

840
01:49:57,213 --> 01:50:00,069
My place is at the king's side.

841
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:03,988
- The first of them have arrived
in town. - We will stay here.

842
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:30,766
Save the queen, madame.
They're coming to kill her.

843
01:50:40,109 --> 01:50:42,863
Celine, don't be frightened.

844
01:50:42,898 --> 01:50:44,198
Let's get the children.

845
01:54:59,344 --> 01:55:02,012
Are you admiring
your lime avenue?

846
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,269
I'm saying goodbye.
