I mean, I'm straight, but the guy smoulders.

I'm having trouble with my game."

219
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,542
I watch him swing a couple of times
and I give him one note.

Yeah, but things are different now.

I-I mean, I can't believe you have
as much fun

we had together,

When you were sent away

901
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:21,914
it was just
another adventure for you.

902
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:26,349
For me, it was
the saddest, hardest time of my life.

903

But I got through it.
And I got through it alone.

And it ended it for me.

905
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:37,505
I need you to accept that
and move on, Wendell.

Will you do that for me?

I'm going to forget about you, Doreen.
