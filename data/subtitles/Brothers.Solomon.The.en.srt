1
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,621
Okay. How do we start?

2
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,034
- A picture would be good.
- Right.

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,638
But we should use one
where we're smiling.

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,164
Nice.

5
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,700
"Two male brothers..."

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,176
Male? That's implied through
the word "brothers."

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,077
I know, I just think that we should be
ultra-clear on this.

8
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,046
About ourselves.
What's there to tell?

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,868
Describe ourselves.

10
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,141
- What's the word?
- Duper?

11
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,298
That's it.

12
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,613
Okay, what's the most
we could hope for?

13
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,215
Oh, I got this one.

14
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,187
- Awesome.
- This is gonna be great.

15
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,779
64.89.

16
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,446
- Can I write a check?
- You're already taken care of.

17
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,121
"Taken care of"? By who?

18
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,633
I watched you at work in here.
I must say I am more than impressed.

19
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,801
John.

20
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,744
Thank you very much,
but I really can't accept this.

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,407
Can't accept what?
Your own groceries?

22
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,520
These are yours. I don't own them.

23
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,246
All I own is the opportunity...

24
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,860
...to come in contact with such
a well-rounded and fun person.

25
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,396
- Should we go to your car?
- No. Thank you.

26
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,193
I don't mean to be rude,
but I bought your groceries.

27
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,860
If you don't leave me alone...

28
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,370
...l'll call security
and they'll kick you out.

29
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,371
You're fighting an uphill battle.

30
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,010
I'm a taxpayer, therefore I can
stand wherever I want.

31
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,805
Taxpayers can stand
where they want.

32
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,675
- Security!
- Security!

33
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,183
You can't block the door.
I don't care how much tax you pay.

34
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,695
Okay, you can do this.
Don't think about past defeats.

35
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,510
Gotta impress her parents,
gotta make a good impression.

36
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,813
Hi, Dean.

37
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,208
I'm so relieved,
you look just like your picture.

38
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,183
Thank you. It's nice to meet you.

39
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,659
That's so sweet.
I want you to meet my dad. Come on.

40
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,434
It's nice to meet you, sir.

41
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,344
Well, I followed your advice
to the letter...

42
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,007
...and everything seemed
to be going great.

43
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,518
But then when I went in
for the kiss...

44
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,213
...he got very standoffish, very cold.

45
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,386
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,357
Do you think I did
something wrong?

47
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:06,564
By expressing the greatest respect
you can show a woman's father?

48
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,600
- That can never be wrong.
- Yeah.

49
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,197
So did you go to the store?

50
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,000
Yup. Spent like 200 bucks.

51
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,505
Get any numbers?

52
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:21,010
No. But I did manage
to get thrown in store jail.

53
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,169
What?

54
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,284
Yeah. Apparently, in the store's eyes,
I was annoying the customers.

55
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,652
Did they know you're current
on your taxes?

56
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,416
- They knew.
- And they still locked you up?

57
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,961
Well, I guess I don't understand
the dating scene.

58
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,091
I know.

59
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,567
It really is a mystery to me.

60
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,107
But you know what?
We've got nothing to be sorry about.

61
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,975
I did the best job I could
at being me today, and so did you.

62
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,142
I love learning from you.

63
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,910
And I love teaching you.

64
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,065
<i>First message, sent today at 1743.</i>

65
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,929
I switched it to military time.

66
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,363
That's great.

67
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,029
<i>This is Dr. Mettler from</i>
<i>the Arctic Ice Data Bank...</i>

68
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,471
<i>... calling again about</i>
<i>those core-sample reports.</i>

69
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,905
I'm on it.

70
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,118
About 10 degrees.

71
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,190
<i>Second message,</i>
<i>sent today at 1143.</i>

72
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,623
<i>Hey, this is Jim</i>
<i>from Movie Time Video.</i>

73
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,626
<i>I'm just calling to remind you...</i>

74
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,791
<i>... that you still owe us $23</i>
<i>in late charges for</i> Ulee's Gold.

75
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,664
Great, now the video store
is pissed.

76
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,572
<i>Third message, sent today at 2043.</i>

77
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,402
"2043." I love it.

78
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,607
Yeah, it's like space time.

79
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,042
<i>Dean, John, this is your father.</i>

80
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,649
<i>I'm down at</i>
<i>Ajax Community Hospital.</i>

81
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,342
<i>I was feeling sick</i>
<i>so I came in for a few tests...</i>

82
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,454
<i>... and I'm afraid I have</i>
<i>some bad news.</i>

83
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,089
<i>Devastating news, actually.</i>

84
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,125
<i>I just want you boys to know</i>
<i>how much I love you...</i>

85
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,159
<i>... and how proud I am of you both.</i>

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,423
<i>Please come as soon</i>
<i>as you possibly can.</i>

87
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,628
Oh, my God.

88
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,163
We just found out our father's dealing
with medical issues, possibly dying...

89
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,502
...so we need to dispute this
late charge quickly. Do you mind if...?

90
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,371
- Go ahead.
- Great.

91
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,240
Have a movie time.

92
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:13,213
We got a call about late charges for
<i>Ulee's Gold</i> but we paid them already.

93
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,444
What's your last name?

94
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,919
We don't have time for this! Our fa...
Solomon. Solomon!

95
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,619
- Says you're paid. Don't worry about it.
- Great! Thank you.

96
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,486
In fact...

97
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,467
...it says you have credit for a movie.
If you like movies.

98
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,236
You can't park that here.

99
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,585
Dad.

100
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,414
Oh, Dad.

101
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,422
He seemed to be doing fine...

102
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,360
...and then, like 10 minutes ago,
he lapsed into the coma.

103
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,401
Well, not even 10 minutes.
More like seven.

104
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,662
Or even six.

105
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,202
We got here as soon as we could.

106
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,441
- It's not good.
- His coma?

107
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,875
No, his coma's fine.
It's a strong coma.

108
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:23,351
That's not surprising.
Dad does everything all the way.

109
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,550
He's amazing.

110
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,058
He can take even the most negative
thing and turn it into a positive.

111
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,722
He's definitely looking at this situation
right now as being half alive.

112
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:40,061
Yes, he seemed very upbeat
for a man slipping into a coma.

113
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,675
He told me how very proud he was
of both of you...

114
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,845
...of his work for the government...

115
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,576
...of the story of meeting your mother,
and of her tragic death.

116
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,679
He told you all that?

117
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,390
He spoke very fast. Remarkable man,
with very few regrets.

118
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,351
"Few regrets"?

119
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,857
Try no regrets.

120
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:07,398
No, he said something about
how he wished he could live...

121
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,194
...to see his first grandchild, or...

122
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,927
I forget how he said it.

123
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,505
You know, if you'd been here, like,
five, even four minutes earlier...

124
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,768
We're very aware of the time line.

125
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,676
Hi, Dad.

126
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,284
Looking good.

127
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,921
Looking real good.

128
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,252
It's too bad there aren't, like,
coma pageants.

129
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,415
Right, John?

130
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,293
- John?
- Sorry.

131
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,532
I was thinking about
what Dr. Wong said.

132
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,597
John, Dad would've wanted us
to dispute that late charge.

133
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,230
No, not about the late charge.
About the grandchild thing.

134
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,240
Look, it's not an exact science...

135
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,406
...but sometimes people hang on...

136
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,882
...if they have a milestone
to look forward to.

137
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,545
Milestone?

138
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,091
Yes. Like an anniversary,
or a birthday, or a...

139
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,660
Or a baby being made for you?

140
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,989
Well, maybe.

141
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,529
Wait. How are we supposed to
make a baby?

142
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,404
I mean, we don't have the best of luck
with women, John.

143
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,011
Dean, I know that.

144
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,977
But before, we were trying
to enter women for ourselves.

145
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:36,451
This time,
we'd be entering women for Dad.

146
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,080
Hands in.

147
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,331
"Make a baby for Dad" on three.

148
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,670
One, two, three.

149
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,468
Make a baby for Dad!

150
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,077
You have got a nice face.

151
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,822
Thank you.

152
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,759
- Sure makes up for that body.
- What?

153
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,963
No. No, no, no.
I'm saying that your face...

154
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,099
...it makes up for your body.

155
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,733
Thank you.

156
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:05,036
Hey, you've got something right...
Right... No. You know what?

157
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,415
Chicken.

158
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,693
I gotta be honest, Erica.
I'm really feeling a connection here.

159
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,461
I mean, you're beautiful,
impeccable dresser...

160
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:36,097
...great personality, nice hair, fat,
great smile, smell good...

161
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,468
Have you ever heard of the phrase
"More cushion for the pushin"'?

162
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,402
Yeah, why?

163
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,880
Because you got it, lady.
Here, lift up your napkin for a sec.

164
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,152
Yep, you've got it.

165
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,621
There it is. There it is.

166
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,124
Are you ovulating right now?

167
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,302
This is our first date
and that's none of your business.

168
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,631
I'm about to make it my business.

169
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,103
Michelle.

170
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,676
Make me the happiest man
in the world...

171
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,754
...and marry me.

172
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,617
Are you joking?

173
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,819
I know. Isn't it great?

174
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,256
No.

175
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,975
What do you say we get out of here,
and I go put a baby in you?

176
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,338
Well, I don't...

177
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,036
No strings attached.

178
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,314
You have no idea how long I've been
wanting to have a baby like this.

179
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,510
I mean, this is like
a dream come true.

180
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,677
For me too.

181
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,518
A no-strings-attached situation
in which I can carry a baby to term...

182
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,491
...have it and then give it
to two wonderful people.

183
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,027
- It's great.
- Awesome!

184
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,598
You know what? I'm gonna deliver
this baby to you on a silver platter.

185
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,756
One hundred percent...

186
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,131
So she got hit by a bus, huh?

187
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,469
Poor girl.

188
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,306
Yeah, the bus took
a pretty serious hit too.

189
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,246
I mean, she was a large girl.
Comfortably in the 200s.

190
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,215
Oh, my God. Sounds horrible.

191
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,550
Yeah.

192
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,020
So how was your date?

193
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,557
Well...

194
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,856
...wasn't exactly an A-plus.

195
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,825
More like an A.

196
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,134
But don't worry.

197
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,804
I'm not giving up just yet.

198
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,033
Still a lot more fight
left in this old bulldog.

199
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,171
God, this thing is gonna be
harder than we thought.

200
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,077
Come on, Dean.
Don't think like that.

201
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,549
I mean, yeah, we're gonna have to
make some sacrifices.

202
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,985
But think about all the sacrifices
that Dad made for us.

203
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,724
<i>Remember that Christmas</i>
<i>Mom died?</i>

204
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,860
<i>Dad told us we could have</i>
<i>anything we wanted.</i>

205
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,588
Where does Santa live?

206
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,759
He lives at the North Pole.

207
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,632
I wanna live at the North Pole.

208
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,267
Me too.

209
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,537
<i>And what did Dad do?</i>

210
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,199
<i>He took us to the North Pole</i>
<i>and raised us there.</i>

211
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,479
<i>And when we were teenagers</i>
<i>and needed a date for prom?</i>

212
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:34,142
<i>Dad went out searching for the most</i>
<i>beautiful women within 100 miles.</i>

213
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,752
<i>He almost died.</i>

214
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,388
<i>But the women he found!</i>

215
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,119
<i>Beautiful.</i>

216
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,919
<i>Oh, Qiqirn.</i>

217
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,820
<i>The times we had.</i>

218
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,658
John, I am completely
back on board.

219
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,960
I can't believe I ever thought
of giving up.

220
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,932
Dean, don't be so hard on yourself.

221
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,628
- You just said "hard on."
- I know.

222
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,172
Dr. Wong called and said
we should start looking...

223
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,571
...for long-term-care facilities
for Dad.

224
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,736
I guess the hospital kicks him out
after a certain point.

225
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,246
Really? Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

226
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,476
Because while you were telling me
that, I found the perfect place.

227
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,814
Really? Where?

228
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,888
I'll tell you tomorrow.

229
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,859
- Hi. Delivery for John Solomon.
- He's not here right now.

230
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,265
- Sign here.
- Okay.

231
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,835
Thank you.

232
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,636
Bring it on in.

233
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,303
All right, this thing here
is a dialysis machine.

234
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,950
That's for the... The kidneys.

235
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,710
These are defibrillator paddles.

236
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,378
If the EKG shows a flatline, rub them
together, put them on the chest and:

237
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,887
Heart should get going again.

238
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,186
There's more to know about that.
Probably take a class or something.

239
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,591
That's coagulants
and anti-coagulants.

240
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,424
This is a blue thing.

241
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,536
The ventilator, oxy tank
and a couple intubation trays.

242
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,366
Have your nurse hook those up.
You have a nurse, right?

243
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,098
Yeah. Okay.

244
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,703
Hold the elevator, please!

245
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,726
Visiting someone on seven?

246
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,294
No.

247
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,323
Check it out?

248
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,434
Stroll it.

249
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,838
No, I live there.

250
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:39,034
You do not. You absolutely do not.
Where on seven?

251
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,805
- 704.
- What?

252
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,676
I am 703.

253
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,113
You ever like to go out for drinks?
Unwind after a long day?

254
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,222
- No.
- Nor do I.

255
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,950
Dad's here!

256
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,721
Yeah, thanks for telling me.

257
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,299
I wanted you to be surprised.

258
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,332
Well, I was surprised.

259
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,030
By how you once again made
the best possible decision.

260
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,038
This is great.

261
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,007
I thought he'd be better off here
than some medical shithole.

262
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,202
So much better off.

263
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,576
And because of a factory recall,
I got a great price on the machines.

264
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,118
Yeah, there might be some flaws in
some of these, only time's gonna tell...

265
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,879
...but flaws equal savings.

266
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,819
Everywhere you look, a positive.

267
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,984
Plus, I got a ton of medical books
highly recommended by Dr. Wang.

268
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,630
- You mean Dr. Wong.
- Dr. Wang.

269
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,767
This dentist I met at Barnes & Noble.
Really knows his shit.

270
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,566
Oh, God. I have some really exciting
news to tell you about.

271
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,171
What? What?

272
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,503
Okay, okay. I just met the most...

273
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,042
Is there any way to turn
Dad's machines down?

274
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,409
I tried earlier but there doesn't seem
to be a volume switch on them.

275
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,844
At least that I can find.

276
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,679
All right, it's just very distracting.

277
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,286
Yeah.

278
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,387
I just met the most gorgeous woman
I've ever seen. Guess where she lives.

279
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,462
- 704.
- 704? Oh, my God.

280
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,259
You gotta see her.
She is amazing.

281
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,527
Tall, super-skinny,
infectious spirit. She...

282
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,306
Crap. You get the circuit breaker,
I'll revive Dad.

283
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,305
Okay. Here I go.

284
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,609
Clear!

285
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,649
- Did you get him?
- I got him. He's back.

286
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,840
Nice job.

287
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,115
I guess we were using
too much power.

288
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,187
Maybe we should turn off
some lights.

289
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,691
All right. Yeah. That'll be good.

290
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,056
Do you think it's safe
to turn the TV back on?

291
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,527
I think it's safe.

292
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,103
See, with all these lights off,
I think you're totally fine. You can do...

293
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,635
Shit balls!

294
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,342
I'll be right there.

295
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,276
Okey-dokey.

296
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,591
Hi.

297
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,224
Ken, hi.

298
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,728
Hi. Can I help you?

299
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,494
John.

300
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,660
Of the elevator and 703 fame.

301
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,931
Just wanted to invite you to a lit...

302
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,597
Sorry, if you can just...

303
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:28,204
Invite you to a little
romantic hallway dinner.

304
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,210
We already have dinner plans.

305
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:41,191
Well, you know what? I do this
all the time, so I'll get you next time.

306
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,317
We should go.

307
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,872
I'm starving.

308
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,485
You guys look really nice.

309
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,091
Who wants bubbly?

310
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,500
- Enjoy your dinner, sport.
- Already am.

311
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,632
You guys want some?

312
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,441
Excuse me.

313
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,974
Champagne does it to me.

314
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,618
I think we maybe need to
broaden our search to include...

315
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,884
...less conventional methods
of having a baby.

316
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,754
Like anal?

317
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,590
Well, I was thinking more along
the lines of adoption.

318
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,063
But isn't adoption kind of cheating?

319
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,172
Look, we just gotta step it up, and that
means exploring every possibility.

320
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,568
Yeah.

321
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,313
You do realize that adoption is
a huge commitment.

322
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,447
We're ready.

323
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,556
So are you married
or just a long-term couple?

324
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,228
We're not gay. We're brothers.

325
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,462
So which of you will have custody?

326
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,464
We're gonna tag-team.

327
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,798
I'm afraid that's not an option.

328
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,669
Unless you're married, one of you
needs to have full legal custody.

329
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,245
Well, in that case,
I guess it'll have to be Dean.

330
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,814
Burn.

331
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,709
Can we have a moment, please?

332
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,324
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

333
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,192
No, I was being facetious.
I do not want this responsibility.

334
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,094
You would be better at this
than me.

335
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,326
What? I'm gonna be
a horrible father.

336
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,198
- You're not.
- Much worse than you.

337
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,272
Well, I mean, what if we get this kid
and it just sucks?

338
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,874
We return it.

339
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,010
- You can do that?
- Of course.

340
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,238
- Why don't you just do it?
- I have bad credit.

341
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,485
Two questions for you.

342
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,854
One: What is your return policy?

343
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,929
Two: Will bad credit
fuck our chances to adopt?

344
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,023
There's no return policy.

345
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,399
And, yes, your financial situation is
of paramount importance.

346
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,032
Do you have any pictures of the kids?
Something that we can...?

347
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,904
Dean, how about that little guy?

348
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,738
No frigging way.
Under no circumstances.

349
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,643
He's got, like,
Bell's palsy or something.

350
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,248
That's my son.

351
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,879
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,751
Bell's palsy is the clinical term,
though, right?

353
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,360
He's clowning for the camera.

354
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,295
God's special little clown.

355
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,426
Get out.

356
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,004
- You look like the real deal.
- Thank you.

357
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,373
Wasn't a compliment.
Why'd you get that thing, anyway?

358
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,674
I don't know. I saw it on Craigslist
and I thought, "What the hell?"

359
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,646
- What's Craigslist?
- It's great.

360
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,683
It's this website that's
got everything:

361
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:33,119
Jobs, pets, cars, ice-dancing suits.
I mean, you can find anything there.

362
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,856
- Anything?
- Anything.

363
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,424
- Anything?
- Anything.

364
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,657
"Two brothers looking
to have baby.

365
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,599
Thank you."

366
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:55,171
Okay. It's a little bare bones,
but if you like it, I can get behind it.

367
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,042
"Thank you."

368
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,514
Send.

369
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,276
All right, so what do we do now?

370
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,444
Now we just sit here and wait.

371
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,559
I almost forgot. This suit does
something a little unexpected.

372
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,285
Check this out.

373
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,362
All ri...

374
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,900
Nice doggy.

375
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,637
Hold the elevator!

376
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,920
We have gotta stop
meeting like this.

377
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,390
People are gonna start to talk.

378
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,392
Got a new generator.

379
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,797
Looks like it's already generating
some heat.

380
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,699
I gotta go get my mail.

381
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,840
Cool, I'll hold the elevates for you.

382
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,702
Please don't.

383
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,573
John? John, is that you?

384
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,980
Get in here!
Craigslist came through!

385
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,620
- We got a response?
- Yeah.

386
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,348
Her name is Janine
and she totally wants to do it.

387
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,355
I mean, there's one little catch.

388
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,494
I knew it. What is it?

389
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,526
She wants $ 10,000.

390
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,925
Ten thousand dollars?

391
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,761
There is a huge demand for babies
right now. It's a seller's market.

392
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,567
Okay, well,
I'll give this Janine a call.

393
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,105
But I might try a little negotiation.

394
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,276
Janine. Hi, it's John and Dean
from the Craigslist.

395
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,647
Let me just start by saying how happy
we are to have a baby with you and...

396
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,948
Well, we were thinking
something in the $20 range.

397
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,281
Won't budge off the 10 thou?

398
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,526
Okay, well, then I am gonna
have to counter with $25.

399
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,926
Forty dollars. Fifty.

400
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,327
Deal!

401
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,967
Okay.

402
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,369
Twelve thousand dollars it is.

403
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,198
Great, bye-bye.

404
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,930
Twelve thousand dollars?

405
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,908
Yeah, she really brought
her A game.

406
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,538
But you know what? Who cares?
You know what this means, right?

407
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,116
- We're having a baby!
- We're having a baby!

408
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,058
You got your
defibrillator paddles there.

409
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,818
And heart machine.

410
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,655
This is...

411
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,525
...a blue medical machine.

412
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,961
This is, you know...

413
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,659
That's a dialysis machine
for the kidneys.

414
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,133
And if you wanna watch TV
or something...

415
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,106
...just throw on the generator,
you'll have power!

416
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,143
Dean, we're gonna be super late.
Come on.

417
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,360
Wait. You go comedy and drama,
I'm gonna go action and foreign.

418
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,214
Let me start by saying...

419
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,380
- You got the money?
- Yes.

420
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,227
So I guess I'll go first.

421
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,996
Wait, I would like to go first.

422
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,231
Relax. We're gonna get
multiple shots here.

423
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,840
What do you mean by
"multiple shots"?

424
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,342
Well, egg fertilization is
a quantity game.

425
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,744
So our plan is to literally blanket
your ovarian walls with our sperm.

426
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,113
We'll each make love to you
until one of our seeds sticks.

427
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,119
Not at the same time.
Taking turns.

428
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,223
- Yes. Yes. John, then me.
- Guys, wait.

429
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,881
- Then Dean, then me.
- Guys.

430
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,085
- Then Dean, then me.
- Then lunch.

431
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,296
Then me, then Dean, then me.
I can't wait to feel myself inside of you.

432
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,763
Guys!

433
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,131
The only thing you're gonna feel
yourself inside of is a cold Dixie cup.

434
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,476
Well, that certainly doesn't make
your vagina sound very appealing.

435
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,136
I'm not talking about my vagina.

436
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,407
I'm talking about
artificial insemination.

437
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,979
I see.

438
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:32,145
A scientist gets to do all the fun stuff
and we get stuck with the frigging bill.

439
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,223
Well, that sounds fair.

440
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,495
Janine, we are spending
a lot of money here.

441
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,324
Shouldn't we get
something out of it?

442
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,127
Yeah, you get a baby out of it.

443
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,765
That is a good point.

444
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,304
Okay.

445
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:54,904
Okay. So I made an appointment at
the sperm bank for tomorrow at 3:00.

446
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,877
- Good times.
- Awesome.

447
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,119
Janine, what the hell is going on
in there? I heard guys.

448
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,757
- Who's that?
- It's my ex-boyfriend, James.

449
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,555
James, I thought we agreed
we were taking a break.

450
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,858
And you already seeing other people?
Who the fuck are these guys?

451
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,035
Hi, James, it's me, John.

452
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,000
And I'm his brother, Dean.
It's nice to meet you.

453
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,072
Nice to meet you too.

454
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,004
The fuck you doing in there?!

455
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,478
No, James, it's okay.

456
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:31,274
We're just working out a plan
in which Janine is having our baby.

457
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,349
Yeah, we're all very excited
about it.

458
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,976
Oh, yeah. I'm getting excited
just hearing about it.

459
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,488
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't the
three of us get together sometime?

460
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,253
That way you can get to know me
and I can beat the shit out of you.

461
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:49,162
James, you better cool it or I'm gonna
call the cops. You want me to do that?

462
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,331
Baby, what you talking about?
I just wanna talk.

463
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,699
Okay, fine.

464
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,272
Wait, can we vote on this?

465
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,909
- I vote no.
- "No" here too.

466
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,012
Looks like the "no's" have it.
Seems like a democratic...

467
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,074
James.

468
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,978
- Have you been crying?
- No.

469
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,814
You poor thing.
Let me get you some tissues.

470
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,581
Okay.

471
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:29,262
So which one of you two assholes
is having a baby with my girl?

472
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,632
- I am.
- I am.

473
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,710
How did you two meet?

474
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,584
Chat room, motherfucker.

475
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,250
So...

476
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,692
...you're a janitor?

477
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:58,564
That's right. I'm a black man
so I must be a janitor.

478
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,705
Motherfucking racist-ass
stereotyper.

479
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,305
It's just, you're...

480
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,500
...wearing a...

481
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,269
...janitor's outfit.

482
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,480
So a black man can't just go
in a thrift shop...

483
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,643
...and buy a janitor's outfit because
he find it comfortable on his nuts.

484
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,915
No, he can.

485
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,153
Especially a black man.

486
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,459
What do you do?

487
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,267
I'm a janitor.

488
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,672
Baby, why you even doing this?

489
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,305
They need a baby, I need the money.
It's that simple.

490
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,612
Okay, so we're gonna go.
Give you guys some privacy and...

491
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,482
We got a big day ahead of us
tomorrow at the sperm bank.

492
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,147
We're gonna need all our energy
for that trip to the...

493
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,316
Don't you fucking say
"sperm bank."

494
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,656
- Fluid...

495
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,163
...depository.

496
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,972
James, I think you should leave too.

497
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,304
- Can we give you a ride somewhere?
- Ain't that a bitch?

498
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,809
So because I'm a black man...

499
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,471
...automatically I ain't got
no goddamn car.

500
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,084
The more I think about
our trip to the...

501
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,255
...bank, the more excited I get.

502
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:36,524
Dean, I need you to promise me that
you're not gonna... yourself off tonight.

503
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,828
We're gonna need every drop of...

504
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,666
...we can muster for tomorrow's trip
to the... bank.

505
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,277
Yeah, well, it's essential that
we fill Janine's... to the tippity-top...

506
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:52,542
...with all the pearly white s... erm
we can conjure up.

507
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:57,313
If you two don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna beat the living...

508
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,183
...out your fucking...

509
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,389
My place over there.

510
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,086
That's your house? It's beautiful.

511
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,859
Surprised? I guess I should be
living in the ghetto.

512
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,571
I think Dean's surprised you live in
a nice house, because you're a janitor.

513
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,037
Bingo.

514
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,870
But you wouldn't be as surprised
if I was a white janitor.

515
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,204
Not as surprised.

516
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,317
He really scares me.

517
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:41,690
When you're done, leave the cups
and an attendant will collect them.

518
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,369
We're not expected to fill
this whole thing, right?

519
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,129
Just do whatever you can.

520
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,866
Okay, good.
I had kind of a big morning.

521
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,067
I thought we promised we were
gonna hold off till this afternoon.

522
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,079
Well, I'm sorry, but there was a
<i>Laverne & Shirley</i> marathon on TV...

523
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,716
...and I, you know, was weak.

524
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,512
Well, I hope, for your sake,
that you are multi-orgasmic.

525
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,712
Well, I am. I swear.

526
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,086
I am like the semen equivalent
of the Energizer Bunny.

527
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,250
- I can have so many orga...
- She gets it.

528
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:17,164
So these are your rooms and
over here is our magazine selection.

529
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,600
I'll leave you two alone
to make your decision.

530
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,705
Okay, so I guess we got sort of
a breast theme there...

531
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,510
...and that has more of a focus
on the vagina there.

532
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,085
But there's vaginal stuff
in the breast one, right?

533
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,246
Yeah, there's plenty of crossover,
I'm sure.

534
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,790
Don't worry, none of these are gonna
give short shrift to the vagina.

535
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,554
- So wait, where were we?
- <i>Jug Junkies.</i>

536
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:51,100
Right, breasts, vagina, senior vaginal,
teen vaginal, housewife anal...

537
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,463
How'd that get there?

538
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,533
What are you doing here,
little lady?

539
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,234
All right, you go ahead
and pick first.

540
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,933
Let's see.

541
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,909
Dean going for
the <i>Indigenous Weekly.</i>

542
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,610
Gotcha. J.K. I know that you
probably want this one.

543
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,550
<i>Indigenous Weekly</i> back in play.

544
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,087
I don't want it.

545
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,225
Let's see... This.

546
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:20,296
Okay. All right, well,
as tempted as I am to get that...

547
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,590
Not.

548
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:25,930
I'm gonna take the <i>Jizz Junkies.</i>

549
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,628
Okay. So bombs away.

550
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,593
Motherfuck!

551
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,797
Well, we finished the procedure.

552
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,034
Janine will be out in a minute.
In a week we'll know if it worked.

553
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,610
So whose sperm was used?

554
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,915
Well, we went in with
your specimen, John.

555
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,311
Oh, really?

556
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,385
But unfortunately there was
no motility in your sperm.

557
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,053
- I'm sterile?
- Basically.

558
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,349
Burn.

559
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,855
So we went with Dean's sperm.

560
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,823
Well, we'll see who's laughing...

561
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,795
...when they spend zero dollars
at the condom store.

562
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,538
Well, I have your results here...

563
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,167
...and I want you to know that
what I am about to tell you...

564
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,247
...has been double-checked
by the lab.

565
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,656
I guess you just never know how
you're gonna react in that situation.

566
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,951
I just got so excited.
I mean, we're gonna be dads!

567
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,617
I know.

568
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,592
Wait, why the hell's it so quiet?

569
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,936
Clear!

570
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,439
Wait a... I think this thing's still on.

571
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,339
These are on too.

572
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,111
I think they're all still on.

573
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,339
- Dad's okay?
- Yeah.

574
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,211
What the hell?

575
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,181
Hey. I was just using
your bathroom.

576
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,657
Your friend had to go back
to the video store...

577
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,990
...so he asked me
to watch your dad.

578
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,134
I hope you don't mind, I turned down
the volume on the machines.

579
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,496
They have volume switches?

580
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,968
Yeah. Inside the back plates.

581
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,039
Crap, is the generator on?
The microwave...

582
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,768
Relax. I rerouted the electricity.

583
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,847
I hope you don't mind, but I helped
myself to some of your chili.

584
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,952
Tara, you need to know something.

585
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,482
Our chili...

586
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,994
...is your chili.

587
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,426
- Thank you.
- No...

588
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,797
...thank you for watching our dad.

589
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,562
No problem.

590
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,967
About that...

591
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:24,403
Do you guys know anything
about vascular pumps...

592
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,244
...or EKGs or any of
this equipment?

593
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,910
- Very much. Much. Very, very much.
- Much. Much, much, much.

594
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,988
Well, I'm training to be a nurse.

595
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,756
What an arousingly selfless pursuit.

596
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:40,021
Anyway, if you guys need any help,
you know...

597
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,564
...I need to watch an intensive-care
patient for three months.

598
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:47,397
So if you were across the hall from me,
it would save me a lot of hassle.

599
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,970
- Deal.
- Great.

600
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:53,576
And, as payment, I will take you
on a series of nighttime dates.

601
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,941
No, that's okay.

602
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,981
I should go.

603
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,950
Do you mind if I take this chili
and bring back the bowl later?

604
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,951
- Just keep the bowl.
- Thank you.

605
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,919
No. No.

606
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,092
That is our chili bowl...

607
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,893
...and you will bring it back.

608
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,392
Understand?

609
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,222
Yeah.

610
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,277
Oh, my God!

611
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,076
So, what was with the bowl thing?

612
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,479
Why take away a reason for her
to come back to our apartment?

613
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,711
If she falls in love with this place...

614
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,050
...it's only a matter of time
before she falls in love...

615
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,953
...with this place.

616
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,820
And then...

617
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:46,955
...this place.

618
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,326
John...

619
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,901
Of course she should return
the chili bowl.

620
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,395
What do you think?
Should we tell Dad the good news?

621
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,105
Yeah.

622
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,915
Dad? You've always given us
everything we've ever wanted.

623
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,381
And now it's payback time.

624
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,283
Dad, you're gonna be
a grandfather.

625
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,982
But, Dad...

626
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,790
...we need a little something
from you.

627
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,267
We need you to stay alive
for nine more months.

628
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,031
We know you can do it...

629
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,267
...because you can do anything
that you put your mind to.

630
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,936
Well...

631
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,847
Look who's in the hot tub.

632
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,494
That's good news for both of us.

633
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,756
I was actually just getting out.

634
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,207
Talk about a wet dream.

635
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:18,413
You know, you don't have to tell me
each time one of those happens.

636
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,382
This was a different kind of wet.

637
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,181
But every bit as satisfying.

638
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,325
<i>Birthday, birthday, birthday</i>

639
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,626
<i>Someone's having a birthday</i>

640
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,792
<i>A day of joy and mirth day</i>

641
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,370
<i>Because it's Jennifer's birthday</i>

642
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,936
Happy birthday, Jennifer.

643
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,583
Really?

644
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,111
Happy birthday to Tiffany.

645
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,232
A toast to the baby.

646
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,502
You can't toast our future baby
with water.

647
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,501
I can't have alcohol if I'm pregnant.

648
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,701
Bingo. That's baby-smart.

649
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,601
Dart it up?

650
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:29,749
I wish you could've seen our dad's face
when we told him about the baby.

651
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,649
It was priceless.

652
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,884
It's really sweet that you guys are
so close to your dad.

653
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,958
Yeah. Our dad is the best.

654
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,687
I mean, when Mom died,
could've really messed us up.

655
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:43,799
But he worked hard to raise us like
every other kid in a two-parent family.

656
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:49,028
You know, homeschooling,
puppetry-based sex education...

657
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,231
...friendship simulations, the works.

658
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,711
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm not happy that my mom died.

659
00:46:55,879 --> 00:47:00,043
Just, it's because of her grisly death
that we turned out the way we did.

660
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,577
- You owe me $5.
- No, I don't.

661
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,883
That is clearly within two inches
of your nose.

662
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,286
This is in my nose.

663
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:13,418
Okay. So I guess your nose isn't
within two inches of your nose.

664
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:17,533
You're right. Here is $5.
Congratulations on a good win.

665
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,725
Thank you.

666
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,233
Well, your dad certainly
gave you guys a positive outlook.

667
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,271
Wish some of that
would rub off on James.

668
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,705
Don't worry about it.
James'll be fine. I'm sure...

669
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,441
The cocksucking newspaper machine
ate my motherfucking quarter, man.

670
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,048
What the fuck?

671
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,951
First trimester.

672
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,525
And that's the nose and mouth,
and there's an eye right there.

673
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,918
Beautiful.

674
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:51,056
Now, should we be concerned at all
that we only saw one eye?

675
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,695
No, I'm sure the other eye is fine.

676
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,270
How sure? A hundred percent?

677
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,075
Well, I suppose
anything's possible.

678
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,735
So there's at least a small chance
we're dealing with a Cyclops.

679
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,042
Well, a Cyclops is
a mythical creature, so no.

680
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,151
- Thank God.
- My God. Check it out, guys.

681
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,913
I'm about to give birth
to an ice cream sandwich.

682
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,318
I just felt it kick.

683
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,427
Are you guys sure
you're ready for this?

684
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,121
Being a dad is a big deal.

685
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,735
You should be prepared.
Maybe spend some time around kids.

686
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,337
Don't you worry, Janine.
We have a plan.

687
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,633
And by the time you poop that thing
out of your baby hole...

688
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,242
...we'll be so prepared,
you won't even recognize us.

689
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,776
We'll be ready.

690
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,247
They're so cute,
I just wanna hug them all to death.

691
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,912
I just wanna squeeze the life
out of them.

692
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,024
Yeah, you might wanna control that.

693
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,454
Okay.

694
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,425
Okay, Jenny, one more trip
down the slide. Just one.

695
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,765
Hello, young lady.
Wanna go get some ice cream?

696
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,460
- Yeah.
- Great, let's go!

697
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,800
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting ice cream. Wanna join?

698
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,534
No, and my daughter
doesn't wanna join either.

699
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,473
Actually, she does wanna join.

700
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,337
Yeah, Mommy, I want ice cream.

701
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,675
Are we done here?

702
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,975
- Jenny, come with Mommy.
- I want ice cream.

703
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,176
Come with Mommy.

704
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:20,847
Hey, Jenny, if you change your mind,
we'll be here in this car.

705
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,288
Nice. Reserve the option for later.

706
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,826
Look at the tits on that one.

707
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,331
Yeah. He needs to lose
a few pounds.

708
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,366
Did you know childhood obesity is
the number one cause...?

709
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,972
Gentlemen.

710
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,233
Hello, officer. One second, please.

711
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,503
It's the number one cause
of early-onset diabetes.

712
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,113
You know what?
I think I did know that.

713
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,408
What can we do for you?

714
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,416
We've had complaints.
Can I ask you what you're doing here?

715
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,990
Trying to coax that girl into our car,
but her mom's being a pain in the ass.

716
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,150
We're just kind of waiting
for an opening.

717
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,158
Get her by herself.

718
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,974
And what is your badge number?

719
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,912
"247726-A."
Great. See you in court.

720
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,279
Or should I say "sue you in court."

721
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:28,652
And please relay that message
to 924, 946, and 955.

722
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,788
Hello, Janine.

723
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,160
Glad you took what I said to heart.

724
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,461
- We took it very to heart.
- Extremely to heart.

725
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,332
You guys just can't practice
on somebody else's kid.

726
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:46,135
I know how badly you guys want this,
but wanting it badly just isn't enough.

727
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,610
Do you guys even know
the first thing about raising a child?

728
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,647
Have you read any books
or done any research?

729
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,144
No.

730
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,081
But, I mean...

731
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,214
- The cavemen didn't read any books.
- He's got a point.

732
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,989
The infant mortality rate back then
was, like, 80 percent.

733
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,458
Well, that's pretty good.

734
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,730
No, that means 80 percent died.

735
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,233
- I went the other way with it.
- This isn't a joke.

736
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,926
I'm not joking, I seriously went
the other way with it.

737
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,163
If you guys are gonna do this...

738
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,140
...you have to stop making decisions
a head-trauma patient would make...

739
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:24,246
...and start making decisions
that a parent would make.

740
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,707
I'll take that into consideration.

741
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,511
- That's not good enough.
- Then we'll heavily consider it.

742
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,516
Can we focus?

743
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,595
Guys. This baby is inside of me,
which means I have some say in this.

744
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,132
If I don't think the two of you
can handle this...

745
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,100
...you will never even lay eyes
on this child. Got it?

746
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,738
Yeah.

747
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,074
Got it.

748
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,043
Dean.

749
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,307
Hands in.

750
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,743
"Become kick-ass dads," on three.

751
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,353
One, two, three.

752
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,150
- Become kick-ass dads!
- Become kick-ass dads!

753
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,524
It's all right, you told them, baby.

754
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,526
Second trimester.

755
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,804
The baby's lost
and you gotta find it. Go.

756
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,144
- Fifteen seconds.
- Where are you?!

757
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,545
Dean, you gotta find that baby!

758
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,793
Got it, got it! How'd I do?

759
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,296
- Fifty-four seconds.
- Nice.

760
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,935
- Yeah, I think it died.
- Crap.

761
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,365
Keep your chin up.

762
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,666
Bound to lose a baby or two
along the way.

763
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,739
<i>I love you.</i>

764
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,945
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

765
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:13,088
It's not always gonna tell us when it's
gonna jump. Gotta think about that.

766
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,120
There you go again,
making me a better person.

767
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,234
Good one, Dean.

768
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,980
Looks like someone's diaper's full.

769
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,744
It crapped out, like,
$5 in quarters. What the hell?

770
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,013
I thought it'd be good
to condition our brains...

771
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,589
...to view diaper-changing
as a positive experience.

772
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:49,747
Brilliant.

773
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,429
A friendship bracelet.

774
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,064
Chicken fingers.

775
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,600
And hot mustard sauce.

776
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,332
Popcorn.

777
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,238
That's not all.

778
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,575
What the hell? I was just starting
to get comfortable with it.

779
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,686
Yeah. I noticed.

780
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,378
What is that supposed to mean?

781
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,548
It's important to get comfortable,
but not too comfortable.

782
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,387
So now I'm too comfortable?

783
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,358
Look, Dean, this is not a game.

784
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,259
We're gonna see some shit
we've never seen before.

785
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,366
Odd combos like
popcorn and dead bird...

786
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,468
...are gonna seem
like sugar and spice.

787
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,696
Just don't get too close.

788
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,704
Fine.

789
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,381
I love you too. Apology accepted.

790
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,543
<i>Ready to see a fully</i>
<i>baby-proofed apartment?</i>

791
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,155
It's called the Super Baby Mat.

792
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:02,298
It rolls right up and stores
right under the cupboard.

793
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,659
Hey, guys.

794
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,339
Check out the nursery.

795
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,269
This is really nice.

796
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,177
What the fuck is that?

797
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,407
That the fuck is the crib.

798
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,245
The safest place in the house.

799
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,485
Dean, a demonstration.

800
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,325
Look out!

801
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,203
See? Not a shard of glass
gets through.

802
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,438
Been doing some diaper training,
I see.

803
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,041
Yeah, that's Snickers.

804
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,614
Does not smell like Snickers.

805
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,444
No, Snickers is the name
of our neighbor's dog.

806
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,415
Hi.

807
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:08,788
I can't really talk right now.
Baby's sleeping.

808
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,457
It can hear me talking
through my chest cavity.

809
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,764
Really good to see you.

810
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,108
- Third trimester.
- Third trimester.

811
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,315
Looking good.
It's got all its fingers and toes.

812
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,885
Should be very happy.

813
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,150
I'll give you four a moment.

814
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,356
Hey, you guys wanna see how that
ice cream sandwich is progressing?

815
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,495
What is that?

816
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,498
I got this last week.
It's one of those temporary ones.

817
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,302
Just comes off after
a few laser sessions.

818
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,578
I'm walking into the apartment now.

819
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,474
I can still hear you.

820
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,243
- <i>Great.</i>
- Hey, Tara.

821
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,953
<i>Hi from the car, Tara.</i>

822
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,955
The inter-apartment
communication system is a go.

823
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:12,319
Roger that.
Tell her the news, good buddy.

824
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,860
Oh, yeah. Tara, great news.

825
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,592
The ultrasound went really well,
so we're going to a celebratory movie.

826
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:23,865
And Janine has offered to look
after Dad so you can come with us.

827
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,803
I have a book I want to finish.

828
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:31,176
Are you sure? I could hold your hand
on the way to and during the movie.

829
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,511
No. Just go.

830
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,881
Okay. Janine, looks like you back in.
Shall we?

831
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,617
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
I'll meet you down in the car.

832
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,952
Okay. Bye, Tara.

833
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,562
Bathroom's down the hall.

834
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:55,397
Yeah, I know. Look, I know you think
they're just a couple of losers.

835
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:59,508
That's what I thought too, but once
you know them, they're great guys.

836
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,076
And I know they do
some weird stuff sometimes...

837
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,146
Actually, all the time.

838
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,977
But their heart's in the right place.
So, what do you say?

839
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,343
Yeah.

840
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,678
Great. You'll go to the movie.

841
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,815
No, I meant, yeah, I think
they're just a couple of losers.

842
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,028
Okay.

843
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,225
Enjoy your book.

844
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:50,726
This is all about encouragement
and relaxation.

845
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:54,489
- Just do it with me.
- So partners, guide the mothers.

846
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,097
Help them focus.

847
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,029
- Faster, faster.
- Breathe together.

848
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,361
You gotta pace it up.

849
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,128
Don't listen to a word John says.

850
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,397
Keep it slower.
Shoot for one breath a minute.

851
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,508
Calm down. You heard the bitch say
to relax. Calm the fuck down!

852
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,268
Do you have to swear, honey?

853
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,503
- Keep it slow.
- No, you fucking it up.

854
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,376
Guys, this is not fair to a...
This is... Guys!

855
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,111
Cut that shit out!

856
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,558
Very good, guys. That was great.
That's our class.

857
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,626
I'll see you guys next week.
Thank you.

858
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,588
Hey, class?
Look who brought their new baby.

859
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,225
- Welcome back, guys.
- Thank you.

860
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,427
Hey everybody. This is Tyler.

861
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,399
- Any advice for the mothers-to-be?
- Get an epidural.

862
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,845
Gosh.

863
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:49,484
What can I say?
It's the most magical moment.

864
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,486
It's just wonderful. I mean,
the first time you see this little guy...

865
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,956
And it's like you're looking
at a little part of you, you know?

866
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,096
I'm sorry.
Every time I talk about it, I get...

867
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,292
It's just so powerful.

868
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,864
You will see.

869
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,965
So does anybody want to
meet this little fellow?

870
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,831
Fuck it.
I'll meet that little motherfucker.

871
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,807
Guess I'll meet
the motherfucker. Sure.

872
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,281
- Should we? Think so?
- Yeah.

873
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,453
Honey, I'm gonna go get the car.

874
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,153
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

875
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,023
Ultrasound picture.

876
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,795
Thank you.

877
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,833
That's really sweet. Thank you.

878
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,334
No, thank you.

879
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,132
We are already
so attached to this baby.

880
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,070
And it's been inside you
eight months.

881
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,938
I can't imagine how attached
you must be at this point.

882
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,808
And in two weeks it's gonna be
taken from your body...

883
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,744
...and immediately placed
in our arms.

884
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,544
I can see why so many surrogates
wanna keep their babies.

885
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,654
And your body could stop
producing eggs or something.

886
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,756
That happens all the time.

887
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,721
And knowing there's
even a chance...

888
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,691
...this could be your only child,
and you're giving it to us?

889
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:11,096
Well, a framed picture of the
very precious thing you're giving up...

890
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,997
...is the least we could do. Thanks.

891
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,066
You know, I could stop by every now
and then and help out. I don't mind.

892
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,438
Oh, no, no.
You've done more than enough.

893
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,137
- We will take it from here.
- Your work is done. Thanks.

894
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,714
Okay.

895
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,374
Group hug?

896
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,696
John? What's the combination
to the fridge again?

897
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,605
27 left, 32 right, 25 left.

898
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,233
You know, I was thinking maybe we
should put some locks on the locks.

899
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,280
In case the baby learns
the combination to the original locks.

900
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,078
Hey, look at this.

901
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,888
It's a letter from Janine!

902
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,455
That's nice of her.

903
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,353
Hand-delivered.

904
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,756
"Dear John and Dean,
I should start by saying...

905
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,363
...what great fathers
I think you're gonna be.

906
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,125
Never thought I'd say that
and mean it." Hear that, Dad?

907
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,362
"After seeing your hard work
and dedication...

908
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,267
...I realize how badly you want it.

909
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,433
Unfortunately, last night you made me
realize just how badly I want it too.

910
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:33,072
It kills me to write this,
but I have decided to...

911
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,277
...keep the baby.

912
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,120
I hope one day you'll forgive me.
Janine."

913
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,313
Oh, my God.

914
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,691
Let's get dressed, let's get dressed.
You're right.

915
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,864
Tara, could you watch our Dad for us?
We're going to find Janine.

916
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,784
She's not here.
Let's go to James' house.

917
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,994
- They're not here.
- I know!

918
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:36,636
So, what do we do now?

919
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,543
Hey.

920
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:44,413
I was just watching your dad
and needed to use the bathroom.

921
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,015
- Did you find her?
- No.

922
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,386
But very thoughtful of you to ask.

923
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:55,362
If that thoughtful attitude you displayed
was the attitude of the world...

924
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,089
...there'd be no war.

925
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,593
I should go.

926
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,900
Well, have a fantastic
whatever-you're-doing...

927
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,270
...and a great
whatever-you're-doing-after-that.

928
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,525
How can you be so nonchalant
about this?

929
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:31,326
Because I know that if this doesn't
work out, we have other options.

930
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,024
We have dick.

931
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:38,196
No, we do not have dick.
We have Tara. Well, I have Tara.

932
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,432
Tara?

933
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,476
It's about time I took this thing
with Tara to the next level.

934
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,806
She's not into you, John.

935
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,407
What?

936
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:53,221
She's not into you.
Can't you see that?

937
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,952
You're just jealous of what we have.

938
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,123
Jealous of what you have?

939
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,825
I already have what you have:
Nothing.

940
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,095
She thinks you're a loser.

941
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,799
Oh, really? And how did you come up
with your expert analysis?

942
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,911
From your combined total of five hours
of relationship experience?

943
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,578
Because I heard her say it.

944
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,518
What?

945
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,352
I overheard Tara talking to Janine.

946
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,060
She thinks you're a loser.

947
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,220
I mean, she thinks
we're both losers.

948
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,956
You know what? Maybe she's right.

949
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,500
Maybe all that stuff that Dad
used to say was just bullshit.

950
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,763
And we're just too big of losers
to know it.

951
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,774
Really?

952
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,912
So I've always been such a loser?

953
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,206
I guess I was a huge loser...

954
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:56,681
...when I was voted our school's
goddamn homecoming king!

955
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,953
- We were homeschooled.
- You're just upset because I beat you!

956
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,185
- You tied me.
- And I won the tiebreaker.

957
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,590
Fine, you won.
You're less of a loser than me.

958
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,286
But you're still a loser.

959
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:15,192
Well, if I'm such a loser,
maybe you'd be better off without me.

960
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,237
Yeah. Maybe I would.

961
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,673
Good. Because you know what?
I'll find her faster on my own anyway.

962
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:25,245
Well, I certainly wouldn't wanna
slow you down.

963
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,473
Then maybe I should
get the hell out of here.

964
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,481
Yeah. Maybe you should.

965
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,382
- Fine. Have a nice life.
- I will!

966
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,455
Good, I hope you don't die!

967
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,121
John!

968
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,324
Dean?

969
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,894
I am so proud of you.

970
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:31,903
Thanks, Pop.

971
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,103
Isn't he great?

972
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,306
Dean.

973
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,718
Keep focused on
finding Janine, on three.

974
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,452
One. Two. Three.

975
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,188
Keep focused on finding Janine!

976
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,201
Oh, God.

977
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:26,494
That's strange.
My shower's running.

978
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,563
It's strange because I live alone.

979
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,738
Can I ask what you're doing here?

980
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,049
I saw a sign out front
that said "Room For Rent.

981
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,879
Wanted:

982
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,183
A bull-headed brother who sometimes
sticks his foot in his mouth."

983
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,584
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid you're too late.

984
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,963
There's already a bull-headed brother
who sticks his foot in his mouth...

985
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,501
...renting this apartment.

986
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,900
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

987
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,536
You're talking to him.

988
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,784
That's too bad.

989
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:40,602
Say, do you think there's enough room
for me to crash here...

990
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,632
...while I look for a place willing
to take a bull-headed brother...

991
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:48,504
...who sometimes sticks
his foot in his mouth...

992
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,269
...who's really, really sorry?

993
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,516
I don't know.

994
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,780
Two bull-headed brothers who
stick their feet in their mouth...

995
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:02,014
...in one small apartment?

996
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,850
That doesn't sound like
it would work out.

997
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,563
Yeah.

998
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,033
How long are we talking?

999
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,601
Not very long.

1000
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,532
Only the rest of my life.

1001
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,268
How much you willing to pay?

1002
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,411
Just all the money in the world.

1003
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,280
Come here!

1004
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:40,351
- God, I've missed you.
- I missed you too.

1005
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:45,558
Hey, could I get you to
throw on a towel or something?

1006
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,563
- You got it.
- Great.

1007
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,107
- How's that?
- Great. Thank you.

1008
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,515
Take a look in that mirror.

1009
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,814
There's not a man on this earth
I'd rather have a baby with.

1010
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,915
Hands in.

1011
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:12,458
Towel off, get dressed and come up
with a plan to find Janine, on three.

1012
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,255
One. Two. Three.

1013
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:18,890
Towel off, get dressed and
come up with a plan to find Janine!

1014
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,103
Wait, hold up.
We gotta get Tara to watch Dad.

1015
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,739
Oh, yeah. Look, I'll do it.

1016
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:28,172
No, no.
This is something I have to do.

1017
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,902
Yeah.

1018
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,293
Hey, Tara.
Can you watch our dad for us?

1019
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,031
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

1020
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,635
Great, thanks.

1021
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,264
Wait a minute.

1022
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,437
- That's it?
- Yeah, why?

1023
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,804
You're not gonna ask me to dinner
or anything?

1024
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,911
Dinner. Does sound good.

1025
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,811
But no.

1026
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,515
And also, I'm over you.

1027
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,244
Burn! Facial! Suck it!

1028
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,097
All right, let's game plan.

1029
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:36,335
Between the two of us, we've already
searched every place she would be.

1030
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,911
She could be anywhere.

1031
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,514
I wish there was some way
to communicate with her...

1032
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,981
...and say what we wanted to say
in a way which didn't threaten her.

1033
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,778
Fortune cookies?

1034
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,081
- Interesting idea, but...
- Flyers?

1035
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,249
You're on the right track,
but I don't think we've hit it yet.

1036
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,866
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1037
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,373
What a great and delicious idea.

1038
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:14,778
Your engine cannot run on optimum
capability if there's no gas in the tank.

1039
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,886
All right. We gotta get our message
through to Janine, but how?

1040
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:20,681
Yeah.

1041
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:27,855
- Oh, my God.
- I got it.

1042
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,725
It was right in front of our face.

1043
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:33,061
I got there a fraction of a second
after you did. It is so obvious.

1044
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,224
Let's go.

1045
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,170
- Where you going?
- The apple orchard is this way.

1046
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,207
What does that
have to do with anything?

1047
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:45,369
- What were you thinking?
- I'll tell you on the way. Let's go.

1048
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,948
I can't believe they charged us
50 bucks a letter.

1049
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,144
That's why we kept it short.

1050
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,381
So, what do we do now?

1051
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,185
We wait.

1052
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,898
Oh, my God. I think I see it.

1053
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,033
"Hi, my name is John."

1054
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:19,010
"And I'm his brother Dean."

1055
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,713
<i>"Hi.</i>

1056
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,944
We've got a little situation here,
and, boy, could we use your help."

1057
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,088
"How can you help?

1058
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:30,191
Well, sit back and relax,
we're about to tell you.

1059
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,055
You can start by grabbing
a pen and paper...

1060
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,662
...to write down some information."

1061
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:42,431
"We'll give you a moment
to grab that paper and pen."

1062
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,280
"We are sorry if we didn't
give you enough time...

1063
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,354
...to get the necessary writing
implements...

1064
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,152
...but we are under
serious space constraints...

1065
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,261
...with this sky banner."

1066
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:11,365
"We are looking for a woman
named Janine Rice.

1067
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:16,903
She is five-foot-eight,
blondish hair, blue eyes."

1068
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,972
"Oh, that really narrows it down."

1069
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:21,837
"Fine, Dean, then how
would you describe her?"

1070
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,502
"Well, she just looks like a normal,
pretty American girl."

1071
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,376
"Oh, that's much better."

1072
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:30,279
"Janine is eight and a half months
pregnant with our baby.

1073
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,386
Well, fine, Dean's.

1074
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,018
I have a problem
with sperm motility...

1075
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:43,756
...a subject Dean likes
to rub in my face."

1076
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,598
"Okay, let me get in here
for a second.

1077
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,796
You make one little joke
about a guy's infertility...

1078
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,374
...and suddenly you deserve
to be labeled a jerk..."

1079
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,876
"On a sky banner that could
potentially be seen...

1080
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,879
...by 50,000 people?

1081
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,539
That's fucking bullshit."

1082
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,448
"Dean, none of that matters
right now.

1083
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:15,222
What matters most is that Janine sees
this sign, especially this next part."

1084
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,456
"So for those of you reading this...

1085
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,397
...we need to ask you
for just one more favor."

1086
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,085
"Just in case Janine has
her back turned or something...

1087
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,057
...and can't read the sign..."

1088
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:52,030
"It would really be a big help
if we could get you to yell out:"

1089
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,397
"'Janine, look in the sky."'

1090
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,967
- "'Janine, look in the sky."'
- "'Janine, look in the sky!"'

1091
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,739
Janine, look in the sky!

1092
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,437
Janine, look in the sky!

1093
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,846
Janine, look in the sky!

1094
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,854
Think this maybe might work?

1095
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:18,686
I think this definitely
maybe might work.

1096
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,692
Janine, look in the sky!

1097
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,531
Janine, look in the sky!

1098
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,133
Baby.

1099
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,306
I think you need to
take a look at this.

1100
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,445
"Janine, hopefully you're
reading this right now.

1101
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,014
There's so much
we need to tell you.

1102
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,210
We never meant to come
between you and the baby."

1103
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:49,983
"So we want you to keep the baby,
but we want you to keep us too.

1104
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,754
Maybe if we had told you that in
the first place, you'd never have left.

1105
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,058
Hopefully we're not too late."

1106
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,999
"Oh, my God.
John, are you crying?"

1107
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,802
"No, I have something in my eye."

1108
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:07,203
"Anyways, please,
if you have any information...

1109
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,869
...we are offering a reward of
500 doll hairs.

1110
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,038
Just kidding, dollars."

1111
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,911
- "Nice."
- "Thank you."

1112
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,264
What the hell? They cut off our...

1113
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,460
Wait. Look!

1114
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:53,045
<i>You have one new message.</i>
<i>Message sent today at 1443.</i>

1115
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:57,180
<i>Hey, my name's Matt</i>
<i>and I'm calling about the sky banner.</i>

1116
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,020
<i>I wanna propose to my girlfriend...</i>

1117
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,594
<i>... and I need the phone number</i>
<i>of the banner place.</i>

1118
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:05,028
<i>I'm at 555-0183.</i>

1119
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,635
Oh, hey, Tara, we're home.

1120
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,207
She loves that bathroom.

1121
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,948
Well, we did our best.

1122
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:24,649
Yup.

1123
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,314
And Dad knows that.

1124
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,090
We got nothing to be ashamed of.

1125
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:34,855
Hands in.

1126
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,134
What should we do on this one?

1127
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,133
I'm really kind of stumped, like...

1128
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:49,368
I gotta be honest, I don't know
if I have anything left in me.

1129
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:53,847
How about
"Janine's right behind us," on three?

1130
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,381
- Oh, my God.
- Janine?

1131
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,815
I had to use your bathroom.
I hope you don't mind.

1132
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,614
After all, I'm peeing for five now.

1133
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,324
That is, if the offer still stands.

1134
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,794
Oh, my God. Do you mean it?

1135
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,161
Janine!

1136
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:12,700
Sorry.

1137
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:14,959
So you saw our sky banner?

1138
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,461
Actually, James did.

1139
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,636
Hey, guys.

1140
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,300
James!

1141
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:28,112
All right. Yeah, all right, settle down.
Relax. Everybody back the fuck up.

1142
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:31,946
I have a little something I've been
saving for a special occasion.

1143
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,886
This is the perfect time to open it.
It doesn't get more special than this.

1144
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:41,320
Hey there, little one. How are you?
We missed you so much.

1145
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,825
Oh, here it is.

1146
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,133
Oh, my God. My water just broke.

1147
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,065
We gotta go. We gotta go, honey.
Come on! Let's go!

1148
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,105
- We're having a baby!
- Quit blowing that!

1149
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,403
We're having a baby!
Dean, we're having a baby!

1150
01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:00,139
Wait, wait! How are we gonna
get Dad to the hospital?

1151
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,839
I'm on it.

1152
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,954
911? Hurry, send an ambulance!
My father's dying!

1153
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,126
We're having a baby!

1154
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,594
- Hold it in!
- Keep it in there!

1155
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,104
Suck it up there! Come on!
That's great! Don't breathe!

1156
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,003
Just breathe, baby. Just breathe.

1157
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:30,975
That's it.

1158
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,443
Where's the fucking doctor?!

1159
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,310
- She's ready, get the doctor.
- Hurry, she's having a baby!

1160
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:39,110
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- How dilated is she?

1161
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,755
Where's the doctor?
It's getting hot in here.

1162
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,050
Oh, Jesus.
My bad, my bad, my bad.

1163
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,214
Surprise!

1164
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,725
- Look who's here!
- What the fuck?

1165
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,894
Just trying to give Dad
a view of the birth.

1166
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,863
There's too much blanket.

1167
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,626
That's the sweet spot.

1168
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:59,998
Okay. Let's do this thing.

1169
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:03,144
Okay. Okay.
It's all right. It's all right.

1170
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:04,573
Push.

1171
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,680
Breathe.

1172
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:09,043
- Push!
- It's crowning.

1173
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,185
Push, Janine. Push, Janine.

1174
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,843
One more push. One more.

1175
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,182
That's good. That's good, baby.
That's good.

1176
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,915
It's coming out!

1177
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,184
Come on.

1178
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,651
That's it.

1179
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,694
The head is out. The head is out.

1180
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,258
I see the head!

1181
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,093
That's good, baby. It's all right.

1182
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:30,431
One more big push, Janine. Come on.
One more big push.

1183
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,564
That's it. Push hard. Push hard.
Look up.

1184
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,938
There it is. Very good, Janine.

1185
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,517
Congratulations, it's a boy.

1186
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,084
You had a baby!

1187
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:56,458
It's a baby! It came out of there!
We saw it! We saw it come out...

1188
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,668
Now, that is one beautiful baby.

1189
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,610
Can we show the baby to Dad?

1190
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:19,578
Dad, I'd like to introduce you
to your new grandson.

1191
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,655
Dad, he's got your eyes.

1192
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,800
Okay, let's get a picture
of the happy family.

1193
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,665
One, two, three.

1194
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,678
And remember, put the bungee cord
around your wrist...

1195
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,254
...so when the baby does
a roof fall, no harm done.

1196
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,481
All right.

1197
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:59,058
But never leave the child
alone with the cord.

1198
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:02,355
Where do I start? Hanging hazard,
potential tripping danger...

1199
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,192
...autoerotic-asphyxiation risk...
- What?

1200
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,766
Kids are starting really early
these days with that.

1201
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,837
Listen, you might wanna change
that cord a couple times a year.

1202
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:15,203
Otherwise, the elasticity goes to shit,
and that's your baby's ass, partner.

1203
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:18,209
- Thanks, James.
- Thank you for your business.

1204
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:22,679
Thank you. They said there were three
number one causes of child death.

1205
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,318
What was the third one again?

1206
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:25,817
Jesus!

1207
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,012
It's okay, he's fine. He's in a coma.

1208
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,315
I hope he lives.

1209
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,924
Hope your baby doesn't die.

1210
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,287
- Guard your baby with your life.
- Don't fuck up.

1211
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:37,156
Thanks again.
- Sure.

1212
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,993
Safety first, right?

1213
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,734
I love you.

1214
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,927
Who's that over there?

1215
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:47,302
Who's this? That's grandpa.
Can you say "grandpa"?

1216
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,965
He's not gonna be able to talk...

1217
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:50,675
Grandpa?

1218
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:51,869
- No way!
- Holy fuck!

1219
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,474
Dean. Don't swear.

1220
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,483
Well, I'm sorry.

1221
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,747
You never know how you'll react
when your baby says his first words.

1222
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,753
Well, be careful.

1223
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:05,583
Babies are like little sponges.

1224
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,920
Sorry.

1225
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,653
Fuck.

1226
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,932
Didn't I tell you this motherfucker
was like a sponge?

1227
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,796
- No, no, no. That's a bad word.
- Bad word.

1228
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,096
No, no, that's okay.
Say the other word.

1229
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,399
Say the other word.
Say the other word.

1230
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:23,032
- The other word will make you happy.
- Say "grandpa." Say "grandpa."

1231
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:24,508
Grandpa?

1232
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,174
Good boy.

1233
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,006
Grandson.

1234
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,410
Grandson?

1235
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:35,519
- Dad?
- Dad?

1236
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,351
Oh, my God.

1237
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,699
Look. It's your grandson.

1238
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:57,609
Holy shit.

1239
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:01,344
Holy shit is right, Dad.

1240
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,408
We used every lesson you ever
taught us to help get him for you.

1241
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:08,954
He's a Solomon.
We even named him after you.

1242
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,054
I'm so proud of you boys.

1243
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,158
You did good.

1244
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,425
Hands in.

1245
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,067
"Solomon family," on three.

1246
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:32,209
One, two, three. Solomon family!

1247
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:55,726
Let's do this.

1248
01:27:58,339 --> 01:27:59,533
Head came off.

1249
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,231
Okay, that wasn't good enough.

1250
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,242
But the baby's still here.
What if it brought a friend?!

1251
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,346
Let's do this!

1252
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,447
Action.

1253
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,018
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1254
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:22,294
Tell all your friends to come on over.
It's the blue car. It's the fun car.

1255
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,624
We'll be right here. Rain or shine.

1256
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,960
Luckily, we're both wearing
rain coats.

1257
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,727
Baby scramble.

1258
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:32,296
Line it up!

1259
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:41,876
So I guess herpes and gonorrhea
and AIDS aren't a problem for you.

1260
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,580
That was not your five.

1261
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:49,519
When my brother has a five
hanging in the wind...

1262
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,955
...I don't leave it there.

1263
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:53,423
Thank you.

1264
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,292
He's not handicapped.

1265
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,230
Handi-capable.

1266
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:02,164
No, he's...

1267
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,362
- Disabled?
- No.

1268
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,769
- He's...
- Not fully cooked.

1269
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:09,171
He's clowning for the camera.

1270
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,339
God's special little clown.

1271
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:12,535
Get out.

1272
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,375
- Now?
- Now!

1273
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,606
I told you.

1274
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,808
- Does he want us to go?
- I don't know.

1275
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,348
They're not making any noise.

1276
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:32,822
What?

1277
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,439
Oh, my God.

1278
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:55,152
Cut.
