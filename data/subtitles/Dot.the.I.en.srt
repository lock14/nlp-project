3
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:52,260
Carmen, I don't want you to go back.

4
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,199
I'm not going back.

5
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:56,835
Good.

6
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:00,408
I'm never going back.

7
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:10,045
Marry me, Carmen.

8
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,816
What?

9
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,092
Marry me.

10
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,364
Barnaby...

11
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,393
- we've known each other for...
- Six months.

12
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,998
- Five.
- And a half. So what?

13
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,177
So what, Carmen?
I've never been so sure of anything.

14
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,047
I've never been so happy as since
I met you.

15
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:46,053
Just promise me
you'll think about it. Please?

16
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:17,115
I'm afraid we are fully booked.
Another time, no doubt.

17
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,255
I'd like to propose a toast to Carmen...

18
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:24,887
who's gonna be the blushing bride
to her sexy new husband.

19
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,726
Cheers.

20
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,264
- Put it on automatic.
- I don't want to.

21
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,462
Just put it on automatic,
because it does it for you.

22
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:35,938
That's videotaping, not filmmaking.
I'm a filmmaker, not a videotaper.

23
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,476
Yeah, give me the fucking camera.
Put it on automatic...

24
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:41,171
because it does it for you. Dick.

25
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,347
- Messieurs, bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

26
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,018
We have a table.

27
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,851
- Under what name, monsieur?
- Kit Winter.

28
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,317
Yes.

29
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,728
Gentlemen, I'm afraid there has been
a little mix-up.

30
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:01,061
Would you mind sharing a table?

31
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,192
- Fuck's sake.
- No, we don't mind.

32
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,499
- Which table?
- That one, monsieur.

33
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,463
We'll take it.

34
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,856
Are you all right?

35
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:32,161
- Lesbians.
- What?

36
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,628
Lesbians.

37
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,300
Shut the fuck up, Theo.

38
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,065
I mean, hey, whatever floats your boat.

39
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,709
Oh, no.

40
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,847
It's a French tradition. You have to do it.

41
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,975
It's a French restaurant, French tradition.
It'll bring you luck.

42
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,576
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

43
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,679
- Go on.
- Okay.

44
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:03,121
Mesdames et messieurs...

45
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,026
these ladies are celebrating a hen night.

46
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,563
In France, we have a tradition.

47
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:12,660
The bride-to-be must choose a man
for one last kiss.

48
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,562
A farewell to her single life.

49
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,307
- Not him.
- Check them out down here.

50
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,465
Mesdames et messieurs,
the bride-to-be has chosen...

51
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,867
monsieur.

52
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,213
Here goes.

53
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:11,687
Excuse me. Sorry.

54
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:13,978
Bravo!

55
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,255
So, this guy in the restaurant...

56
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,818
- was he bothering you?
- No.

57
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,920
- He was...
- Did you hit him?

58
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,866
You hit him, didn't you?

59
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,932
Oh, that's beautiful.

60
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:11,705
You know, your temper is gonna get you
into serious trouble one of these days.

61
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,443
No, I've got it.

62
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:26,054
You know, it's amazing what they can
do with skin grafts now.

63
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,561
I'm sorry.

64
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,451
- Maybe they'd like to join us.
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,563
I told you I'll be back.
You can't hide from me.

66
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,761
Like, you can't say I'm not a fair man.
I gave you two months...

67
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:14,669
Now look, I told you.
Now get your things and out.

68
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,483
Where did you get this?

69
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,287
Are you...

70
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,020
dealing drugs?

71
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,119
Yes?

72
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,294
That French tradition?

73
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,096
I was thinking that...

74
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,398
Hey, where do you think you're going?
It's not your break.

75
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,497
Oy, you can't come back here.
Are you listening to me?

76
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,848
- Overreacting a little, aren't we?
- How did you find me?

77
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,047
Your friends at the restaurant,
they told me where you worked.

78
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,092
- I should get back.
- What, the burgers will get cold?

79
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:46,053
Have you been wondering?

80
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,029
Or do you kiss like that all the time?

81
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:52,428
I've been wondering.

82
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:56,031
I'm getting married, okay?
That's why I was having that...

83
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,665
chicken thing.

84
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,368
Hen night. It's called a hen night.

85
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,573
I'm getting married.

86
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:07,140
Okay, then he gets to see you for the
rest of his life.

87
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,583
What harm is there if you see me
just once?

88
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,651
Would you like to see me beg?

89
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:16,622
Believe me,
I'm no stranger to humiliation.

90
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:17,752
Get up.

91
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,922
- A coffee.
- No.

92
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,592
One glass of water.
In a brightly-lit public place.

93
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,656
No.

94
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:25,669
Okay, we don't even have to talk
to each other.

95
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,500
- We don't even have to sit together.
- No.

96
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,733
You sit on one side of the room
and I sit on the other.

97
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,469
- No.
- And if everything goes really well...

98
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,171
we'll just wave to each other once
in a while.

99
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,310
Why are you filming this?

100
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,050
- Just in case I never see you again.
- Which you won't.

101
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,747
Did you bone her?

102
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,754
Take me off speakerphone.

103
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,520
He didn't bone it.

104
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,220
Tell me you got her number, at least.

105
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:55,460
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- So what did you do?

106
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,390
She agreed to meet me.

107
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,231
Hey, result.

108
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,030
When?

109
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,336
Hello?

110
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:06,202
- Are you sure there was someone there?
- Yes.

111
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:09,005
- Following you?
- Yes. I...

112
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,310
I don't know.

113
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,707
Carmen, there's nothing to be scared of.
I won't let anything happen to you.

114
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,316
But what if it was him?

115
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,515
How could it be?

116
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:28,223
Think about it, Carmen.
There's no way he could find you here.

117
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,817
Well, he found me before.

118
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:32,954
That was Madrid.
You're in another country now.

119
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:36,094
You don't know him.

120
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,804
Maybe it was that guy from the hen night.

121
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,632
What?

122
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,302
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, how do you know?

123
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,379
Because...

124
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:55,781
Maybe it was no one.

125
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,252
Maybe I imagined it.

126
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,734
Carmen, I...

127
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,730
I booked the registry office.

128
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,744
- What?
- They had a cancellation. Next Saturday.

129
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:23,780
Next Saturday?

130
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,774
Did I do the wrong thing?

131
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:33,818
- I can call them in the morning and cancel.
- No, don't.

132
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,057
I want to marry you.

133
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,726
I do.

134
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,185
Any more caffeine, they'd be peeling me...

135
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,187
Oh, shit.

136
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,356
What the fuck?

137
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,533
Why are you following me?

138
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,810
I thought you might like to explain
what the hell that was all about.

139
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,479
Well, this is a nice date.
I'm having a nice time.

140
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,744
This is not a date.

141
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,911
I only showed up to tell you you're
a son of a bitch.

142
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,616
- Well, at least we connected.
- I lost my job because of you.

143
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,658
Is that what this is all about?

144
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,194
You lost your job?
Flipping burgers?

145
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:46,958
Fuck you.

146
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,200
What do you do
that makes you so high and mighty?

147
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,674
I'm an actor.

148
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,677
Unemployed...

149
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:04,808
most of the time.

150
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,350
In fact, I do unemployment really well.

151
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,648
You know, maybe I should just
stop pretending...

152
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,813
and start flipping burgers.

153
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:15,819
Why don't you tell me about the fries
and the pickles and the buns?

154
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:21,596
Look, you're here and I'm bleeding.

155
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,725
I know this great chemist.

156
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:36,869
Thanks.

157
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,051
Thank you.

158
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:52,622
There.

159
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,328
Thanks.

160
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,005
Are you hungry?

161
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:29,090
Hi, this is 7031.
Can I get something to eat?

162
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,806
So how do you know about this place?

163
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,782
How many jobs have you been
fired from?

164
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,087
Exactly?

165
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,651
Thirty-five...

166
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,592
in six months.

167
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,257
- I have a temper.
- Yeah, I noticed. Yeah.

168
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,265
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

169
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,170
- Where are you from?
- Madrid. You?

170
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,569
Rio. Brazil.

171
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,945
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but my dad's English.

172
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,818
So I came here when I was...

173
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,410
What the hell are you...

174
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:24,681
Carmen!

175
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,197
Get off me, you fat, fucking asshole.

176
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,774
You're back.

177
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:49,939
- What is it this time?
- Two steaks, two apple pies.

178
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,311
Entertaining, were we?

179
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,010
- And one bottle of Campo Viejo.
- Viejo.

180
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,312
1996.

181
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,650
Commendable choice.

182
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:03,118
Fiona, get me Sgt. Davies, would you?

183
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:26,106
What the blazes now? Stay there.

184
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,813
Keep left, please.

185
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,255
Please use the left-hand door.

186
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,854
Please use the door on the left.

187
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:37,916
Carmen.

188
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:40,856
Not through the revolving...
Hey!

189
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,574
Stop.

190
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:37,220
- Here.
- Thanks.

191
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:45,821
I didn't ask for your help.

192
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,465
- I know.
- Didn't ask.

193
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,559
No.

194
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:01,875
Your coat.

195
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,647
At the hotel.

196
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,684
It's a saying:

197
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:54,895
"A kiss...

198
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,458
"is to dot the 'I'...

199
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,602
"on the word 'love."'

200
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,211
Yeah, but there's no "I" in "love."

201
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,440
Well...

202
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,713
then I guess it doesn't work in English,
does it?

203
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,960
I better go.

204
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:31,628
Bye.

205
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,189
Barnaby. You scared me.

206
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,791
Nice coat.

207
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,791
- It's a friend's.
- Where's yours?

208
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:08,132
At work. I left it at work.

209
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,768
Well, let's go and get it.

210
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:19,148
Barnaby, what's the matter?

211
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,119
- Come on, let's go and get your coat.
- Barnaby, stop it.

212
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,419
- You need a coat. Everyone needs a coat.
- What's going on?

213
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,492
I called you at work.

214
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:35,557
What?

215
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,532
They told me you'd been fired.

216
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,066
You were checking up on me?

217
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,740
I was worried about you being followed.

218
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,442
Or did you make that up, too?

219
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:06,620
I don't know if I can do this.

220
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:07,857
You know what Ford said.

221
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,400
Yeah, I don't give a flying fuck
what Ford said.

222
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,196
I don't see what the big deal is anyway.

223
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,635
The big deal, Theo...

224
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:19,698
- What's that?
- Shit. It's my landlord.

225
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,069
- I've gotta go. Bye.
- Kit...

226
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:27,976
Asshole.

227
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:33,214
Carmen?

228
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,483
How did you find me?

229
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,530
Thanks. Did you pay it?

230
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,999
Please come in.

231
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,644
Reminds me of home.

232
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:07,385
- Is this your father?
- Yeah.

233
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,518
He used to be a soap star.

234
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:13,730
- Where is he now?
- He...

235
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,631
He's...

236
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,263
Well, I just came to give you your coat.

237
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:26,799
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

238
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:29,271
Wait.

239
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:33,239
I've still got that wine that you gave me.

240
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,423
My father drank his wine out of mugs.

241
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:45,792
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

242
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,161
Mine took it straight from the bottle.

243
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,723
He didn't want anything getting in
the way.

244
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:58,172
- No, don't.
- Yes. Just a little.

245
00:27:58,242 --> 00:27:59,368
No.

246
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,671
- Why do you have to film everything?
- 'Cause moments don't last.

247
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,346
They're not meant to.

248
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,278
Look, I wanna remember you when
you're gone...

249
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,982
and I'm married to this blond girl,
you know...

250
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:16,458
and she's very rich,
and I'm full of regret because of...

251
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,325
- I don't know, just tell me something.
- What?

252
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,624
Anything. How did you meet your fiancé?

253
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,993
I dance sometimes at this club.

254
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,133
They don't pay much, but...

255
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:32,198
Anyway, Barnaby came in one night.

256
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:36,710
What does he do?

257
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,509
Nothing, not really. He is...

258
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,842
- I mean...
- Born with a silver spoon?

259
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,356
- What?
- Rich.

260
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,959
Yeah. A big spoon.

261
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,459
Then why are you so worried
about working?

262
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,797
Because I like to earn my own money.

263
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:01,201
- Is that okay for you?
- Yes.

264
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:04,465
- You think I'm marrying him for his money.
- No.

265
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:09,276
Better, 'cause I'm not.

266
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:10,335
Okay.

267
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,043
My turn.

268
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:24,120
What happened to your father?

269
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:25,956
He...

270
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:32,165
- If you don't want to talk about it...
- No, it's okay.

271
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,863
He killed himself.

272
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,134
Sorry.

273
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:41,411
He did something that he couldn't
live with...

274
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,539
and that's why he came here.

275
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,651
And what...

276
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,885
Sorry, what happened here?

277
00:29:58,295 --> 00:30:00,229
You don't want to know.

278
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:07,033
But it's why you left Madrid.

279
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,207
And it's probably why you're marrying
Barnaby.

280
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:14,972
I'm marrying Barnaby because
I love him.

281
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,573
Then why are you here?

282
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:06,647
Yes?

283
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,624
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

284
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,228
- Have you been following me?
- No.

285
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:22,704
Your friends at the hen night...

286
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,139
They have a big mouth.

287
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:30,741
I brought you this.

288
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:37,619
I meant to give it to you earlier.

289
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,178
I hope you like it.

290
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:45,286
What?

291
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,488
This is my favorite book.

292
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:56,169
I have to get changed.

293
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:07,546
- I'll wait outside, okay?
- Yeah.

294
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

295
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:31,601
Carmen.

296
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,756
And there was me thinking that you were
trying to run away from me again.

297
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:54,422
Kit, I like you, really...

298
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,097
but I don't want to fuck up what I
have with Barnaby.

299
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:00,333
I'm getting married...

300
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:02,704
on Saturday.

301
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,368
This Saturday?

302
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,781
I've had enough trouble for one life.

303
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:18,844
Don't make any more.

304
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,793
Carmen.

305
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,014
Are you okay?

306
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:02,865
What do I do?

307
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,693
Are you going to eat that, Kit?

308
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:08,204
Theo, will you stop thinking about
your fucking stomach for one moment?

309
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,102
I mean,
he's trying to make a decision here.

310
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,299
Sorry.

311
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,943
- You're in deep.
- I know.

312
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:17,704
- Well, that's good.
- That's good? How's that good?

313
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:22,049
- Theo, tell me, how's that good?
- Well, 'cause, you know...

314
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,914
Well, you knew she was getting married
when you met her.

315
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,218
- I know.
- He's right.

316
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,849
I know he's right. I know.

317
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:32,895
I know, maybe I should just leave her be.
I don't...

318
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,963
No, wait. I mean, think about it.

319
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:40,735
What if she is the one?

320
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:44,433
I mean, are you prepared to risk
the possibility of settling for second best...

321
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,373
somewhere down the line?

322
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,104
Oh, no, I've seen this one.

323
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,510
I've seen this one.
No, 'cause you do a Graduate.

324
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,548
- A what?
- A Graduate. You know...

325
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:56,074
turn up at the wedding,
and if she runs off with you...

326
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:58,914
there you have it.
You gonna eat that? Can I...

327
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,617
Theo, for Christ's sake, life is not
a movie.

328
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,560
Yeah, it is.

329
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:09,127
Come on, whatever you say, whatever
you do, movies always got there first.

330
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,827
Even that line you just said comes
from a movie.

331
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:15,338
Kevin Spacey in
the end of Swimming With Sharks.

332
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:18,602
"Because life is not a movie.

333
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:22,668
"Everyone lies. Good guys lose.

334
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:26,409
"And love does not conquer all."

335
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,816
Are you gonna eat that, Kit?

336
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,522
Not those.

337
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:01,775
Carmen, I wanted to say I'm sorry
for not trusting you.

338
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:05,353
I'm gonna try not to be jealous...

339
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:07,647
or possessive, because...

340
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:12,719
- I know how you hate that.
- That guy from the hen night...

341
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:15,993
- You don't have to explain anything.
- No, I want to.

342
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:21,361
He came to the burger bar.
He is the reason I got fired.

343
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:24,340
And I did see him again.

344
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,499
But I don't want to see him anymore.

345
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,773
You want to postpone, don't you?

346
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,284
- No, I didn't say that.
- It's okay.

347
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,715
- I know you have your doubts.
- I don't.

348
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,154
Look, I'm gonna check into a hotel
tomorrow...

349
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:45,387
- until Saturday.
- Why?

350
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:48,627
Because I want you to have room
to think...

351
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,058
to make the right decision.

352
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,795
I really love you, Carmen.

353
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:59,740
And I swear I'll do anything I can
to make you happy.

354
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:58,975
Marriage, according to the law
of this country...

355
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:01,983
is a union between one man with
one woman...

356
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,610
voluntarily entered into for life...

357
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,487
and to the exclusion of all others.

358
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:09,821
It is solemn and it is binding.

359
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:12,185
"Do you, Barnaby Caspian...

360
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:16,028
"take Carmen Colazzo
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

361
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,567
"to have and to hold from this day
forward...

362
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:21,661
"for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health...

363
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,337
"as long as you both shall live?"

364
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,799
I do.

365
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,407
"And do you, Carmen Colazzo...

366
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:39,353
"take Barnaby Caspian
to be your lawfully wedded husband...

367
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,948
"to have and to hold from this day
forward...

368
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:45,754
"for richer, for poorer...

369
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,725
"in sickness and in health...

370
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:51,289
"for as long as you both shall live?"

371
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:05,573
I do.

372
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:34,274
- Hi.
- Looking for someone?

373
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:37,142
- Yeah, this couple getting married.
- How unusual.

374
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,912
- Spanish girl?
- Yes. That's her.

375
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:42,785
She looked so beautiful.

376
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,245
You're too late.

377
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,150
Carmen, wait!

378
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:56,356
Wait!

379
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,260
Double glazing, it's a bitch.

380
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:25,317
Born with a silver spoon?

381
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:28,086
- What?
- Rich.

382
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:34,133
Yeah. A big spoon.

383
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,937
Then why are you so worried
about working?

384
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,707
Because I like to earn my own money.

385
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,575
Is that okay for you?

386
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,072
- You think I'm marrying him for his money.
- No.

387
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,584
Better, 'cause I'm not.

388
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:56,321
But it's why you left Madrid.

389
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:02,121
And it's probably why you're
marrying Barnaby.

390
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:11,432
I have got a little surprise for you.

391
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:18,677
One Caribbean cruise for two,
first-class.

392
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,180
- Barnaby.
- I know.

393
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:26,582
I couldn't resist.

394
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,391
I want to spoil my wife.

395
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:34,156
We could look a little happier.
They cost a small fortune.

396
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,868
I don't know
if I want to go away right now.

397
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,605
Sorry, what?

398
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,799
Nothing, I...

399
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:55,180
- You surprised me.
- Carmen, we just got married!

400
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:56,646
I'm fine.

401
00:45:56,986 --> 00:46:00,183
Well, if you're fine, then that's fine.

402
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:02,791
Fine. Fine. Fine

403
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,234
Carmen, I paid a lot of money for
decent wine glasses.

404
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,404
Please use them.

405
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,431
I got married.

406
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,555
Dot the "I."

407
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:47,991
See? It does work in English.

408
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:27,950
Carmen?

409
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:30,483
Yes?

410
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,871
There's something that I have to tell you.

411
00:50:59,922 --> 00:51:01,549
Something that...

412
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,988
That's not very...

413
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,464
I lied to you.

414
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:53,704
My friends never told you where I
worked, did they?

415
00:51:56,712 --> 00:52:00,808
- No.
- Then it was you, wasn't it? Following me?

416
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:03,242
No.

417
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:09,614
Oh, Jesus, not again.

418
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:13,119
What are you talking about?

419
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:17,061
I can't believe I'm doing this to Barnaby.
He's been nothing but good to me.

420
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,533
But you can't be with someone just
because they're good to you.

421
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:22,969
- Really? And why not?
- Well, no, because you need...

422
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:27,171
- Because you need passion, I think...
- Passion?

423
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:28,335
Yeah.

424
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:32,110
Don't talk to me about passion.

425
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,879
I've tried passion.

426
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:39,850
Passion for people who don't deserve it...

427
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:42,891
for people who cause me pain.

428
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,293
I've followed my heart before.

429
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:50,557
You want to see what I got?

430
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,543
I wanted to leave.

431
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,447
He had...

432
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,619
other ideas.

433
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,156
I'm sorry.

434
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:23,162
I thought he found me.

435
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:25,995
That he was here...

436
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,065
following me like he used to.

437
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:34,169
Hiding in the shadows, but...

438
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:38,112
- it was you.
- No.

439
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:41,372
No, it wasn't.

440
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,511
Carmen, wait!

441
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:14,010
Barnaby, I'm sorry.

442
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:21,687
I know I fucked up, and you don't
deserve it.

443
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:28,695
But I want you to know it's over.

444
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,265
I don't want to fuck up anymore.

445
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:40,703
Barnaby.

446
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,005
Leave.

447
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:48,211
- Please.
- Just leave, before I...

448
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,548
- I'm not going to...
- Get out!

449
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:53,913
Okay.

450
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:23,243
I hope this thing's working.

451
00:55:28,857 --> 00:55:32,122
You know, everyone thinks that I've
got everything.

452
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:38,424
What have I got?

453
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:45,999
A nice home, money.

454
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:53,012
I haven't got you.

455
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,215
I mean, I never did.

456
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,354
And without you...

457
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,698
Some people say this is the easy way out.

458
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:24,509
It's taking more courage
than anything I've ever done before.

459
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:31,152
Look at me, I'm shaking.

460
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:38,359
The camera never lies, even when it
deceives.

461
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:44,095
This is what I've chosen to do.

462
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:47,432
I love you.

463
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:47,356
Excuse me,
miss, you can't come in here.

464
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:50,496
Where is he?

465
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:59,167
I'm so very sorry.

466
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:06,212
Take that fucking camera out of my face!

467
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:20,391
Kit!

468
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:26,534
- Carmen. What happened?
- He's dead.

469
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:28,365
- What?
- I killed him.

470
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:32,440
Barnaby. He's dead.
I killed him. He shot himself.

471
00:58:32,508 --> 00:58:34,567
- Oh, Jesus, no.
- I got to call about his ambulance.

472
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:36,975
- Fuck. What have I done?
- It's not your fault!

473
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:40,071
Don't you see?
It is my fault, Carmen. I've gotta call Ford.

474
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:43,709
I've got to tell him what's happened.
It's gotta stop right away.

475
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,747
- Who's Ford?
- Why did I do it? Fuck!

476
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:48,881
What's going on?

477
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:51,856
Carmen, I'm so sorry.

478
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:54,055
What?

479
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,029
What the fuck is going on here?

480
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:03,162
I knew it was wrong
right from the start. Okay?

481
00:59:04,072 --> 00:59:05,664
I needed the money.

482
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:08,835
- Kit, you're scaring me.
- I wanted to tell you.

483
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:11,978
I wanted to tell you before, but I just...

484
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:14,648
Tell me what?

485
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,552
Kit? Fuck. Tell me what?

486
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,151
I'm Kit. Kit Winter.

487
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:30,189
- Ford.
- Ford?

488
01:00:34,997 --> 01:00:37,022
- This is Tom and Theo.
- Hi.

489
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,298
- Hi.
- Johnny Handsome.

490
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:42,293
My assistants.

491
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:46,074
- Let me take your coat.
- Thanks.

492
01:00:59,054 --> 01:01:01,318
We're not actually his assistants.

493
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,188
That's just one of Ford's little jokes.

494
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:06,523
No. Yeah, 'cause we're the producers.

495
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:13,695
...letting Ford direct, you know.

496
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:17,466
- Theo, coffee.
- Yeah, sure, director.

497
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:35,282
- Where are you from?
- Brazil.

498
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,589
But my dad's English, so I can work here.

499
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,095
Yeah, but you speak Spanish, yeah?

500
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:47,192
No, I don't.
In Brazil, we speak Portuguese.

501
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:51,064
Good.

502
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,240
What have you been working on recently?

503
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:58,574
Things. Some projects, you know.

504
01:01:59,915 --> 01:02:02,213
It's a bit of a hectic time right now.

505
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:05,213
Things.

506
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:07,445
Do you want to be a star?

507
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:11,292
I don't know.

508
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:13,583
Yes.

509
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:21,529
- Sorry. Coffee's off.
- Thanks.

510
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:27,439
So here it is. A love triangle.

511
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:31,570
There's a couple about to get married,
only the girl's having doubts.

512
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:34,877
You know, the usual shit.
Is she marrying the right guy, blah-blah?

513
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:38,613
She does love her fiancé,
but there's something missing.

514
01:02:40,055 --> 01:02:43,991
And then on her hen night, she meets
someone else.

515
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:48,520
Someone with a little fire in his belly.

516
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,660
And that's when things start to get
interesting.

517
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:53,894
Great.

518
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:56,834
- Where's the script?
- No script.

519
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:01,473
Improvisation. Reality cinema.

520
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:04,172
It's all the rage.

521
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:06,971
- If you get the part...
- Of course.

522
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:11,051
...then you'll use this
whenever you're with the girl...

523
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,784
to get your side of the story.

524
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:22,623
You in?

525
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:25,896
That's it?

526
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:29,695
- You don't want me to audition?
- She's gonna love you.

527
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:32,501
I mean, this whole Latino thing...

528
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,140
it's so now.

529
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:35,773
Righteous.

530
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,074
Theo, contract and release form.

531
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,006
Great. Yeah.

532
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:54,789
He hasn't even
told you the sucker punch yet.

533
01:03:54,863 --> 01:03:57,388
- Theo.
- The real twist of the movie.

534
01:03:57,899 --> 01:03:59,298
What's that?

535
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:04,961
I was gonna tell you about that when
we'd finalized the details.

536
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:11,877
- No. What's he talking about?
- The girl, yeah, and her fiancé?

537
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:14,575
They don't know they're in the movie.

538
01:04:15,116 --> 01:04:16,208
What?

539
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:19,711
That's the hook.

540
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:23,980
They have no idea that they're there
for our entertainment.

541
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,285
It's kind of an emotional snuff movie.

542
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:29,455
Put it on automatic, because it does
it for you.

543
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:32,762
That's videotaping, not filmmaking.
I'm a filmmaker, not a videotaper.

544
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:36,065
You meet the girl on the hen night.
The real thing.

545
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,401
Would you mind sharing a table?

546
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:42,839
- No rehearsals?
- Life has no rehearsals.

547
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:44,242
And there's something else.

548
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:47,475
I'd quite like to play a little joke
on my fiancée this evening.

549
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:49,642
Do you know that French tradition,
the one where...

550
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:54,178
The bride-to-be
must choose a man for one last kiss.

551
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:56,656
And remember, don't let any other
handsome guys in.

552
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,249
I'm afraid we are fully booked, sir.

553
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,351
- That should cover it.
- Yes.

554
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,590
Thank you very much.

555
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:05,155
She's a real beauty.

556
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,598
Spanish. A little nuts.

557
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:10,737
A kind of Betty Blue.

558
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:13,167
Why do you have to film everything?

559
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:17,741
I know where she lives, where she works.

560
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:20,042
- How did you find me?
- Your friends at the restaurant.

561
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:21,707
They have a big mouth.

562
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,650
I even know what her favorite book is.

563
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,379
Seduction ammo.

564
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:31,817
So you want me to break up this
relationship for real?

565
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,019
Fucking A.

566
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:36,796
The guy is a real rich tosspot.

567
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:40,933
You break this couple up, you're gonna
be doing the girl a favor, trust me.

568
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:42,560
I live in the same building as him.

569
01:05:42,637 --> 01:05:44,468
I can get into his flat and hide the
cameras.

570
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:46,507
They've got
this sound and motion function.

571
01:05:46,574 --> 01:05:47,768
Switch themselves on and off.

572
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:50,675
And then, when he's out, I can just get
in and change over the tapes.

573
01:05:50,745 --> 01:05:52,269
- Marry me.
- Barnaby.

574
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:54,338
Life is fucking art, man.

575
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:57,314
I don't believe this.

576
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:00,918
The salary's £300 a week, cash.

577
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:08,185
I can't do it.

578
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:11,459
What?

579
01:06:12,033 --> 01:06:15,594
I mean, doesn't this seem wrong to you?

580
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,365
I don't see where wrong comes into it.

581
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:20,203
Either you want to be a star, or you don't.

582
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:23,142
You want to be famous,
you gotta fuck someone over.

583
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:29,582
Look, I'm flattered, really, guys.
But, no, thanks.

584
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:37,755
No dog experience, but I don't believe
that you need dog experience to...

585
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:39,350
Okay, thank you, bye.

586
01:06:39,894 --> 01:06:41,486
- Okay, £400.
- No.

587
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,595
Yeah, where I come from, in my culture...

588
01:06:43,665 --> 01:06:45,895
it's very important
to do really good burgers.

589
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:47,992
Dreams don't fall into your lap.

590
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:51,837
I know you're in there.

591
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:54,602
You'd better have it
by the time I get back, or you're out!

592
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:56,871
£500. Final offer.

593
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,646
Hi, it's Kit. Yeah, the Brazilian.
Yeah, hi.

594
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:06,153
Is the offer still open?

595
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:22,759
Carmen, I'm sorry.

596
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:28,534
I tried to stop it.

597
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,100
I can't do this anymore, Ford.

598
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:32,612
You pull out now, and I'll sue.
Read your contract.

599
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,011
Just be there.

600
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:36,882
But you didn't stop it, Kit.

601
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:40,015
You didn't stop it.

602
01:07:41,756 --> 01:07:45,283
- It was all an act.
- No, it wasn't. It wasn't an...

603
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:49,229
Not with you.

604
01:07:50,198 --> 01:07:52,689
I was scared that if I told you...

605
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,812
Ford? How did you get into my flat?

606
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:16,254
- Barnaby.
- Barnaby?

607
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,120
Dead man walking.

608
01:08:21,863 --> 01:08:23,387
No fucking way.

609
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:26,666
- You know, sometimes...
- No fucking way.

610
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:29,397
...I amaze myself.

611
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,800
Nice.

612
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:42,440
I saw them.
I saw the police and the ambulance.

613
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:44,016
I saw them.

614
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:49,178
Actors.

615
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:50,918
All right. If she says anything to you...

616
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:54,052
- I'm so sorry.
...just tell her it's police procedure.

617
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,788
I saw blood.

618
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:02,931
Fuck me.

619
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:06,171
- I want to see that back.
- That was magic.

620
01:09:07,175 --> 01:09:08,665
Go on, man.

621
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:12,270
- Did it work?
- It did, yeah.

622
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:14,078
I love you.

623
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:18,176
Fake, like Kit's feelings for you.

624
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:21,245
- No, that's not true.
- What is it you call it?

625
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:22,816
The Method.

626
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:25,285
- You motherfucker.
- What?

627
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:28,858
No one forced you to do anything.
You wanted to be a star. Remember?

628
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,898
- Yeah, well, you fucking married her.
- I know.

629
01:09:30,965 --> 01:09:32,523
Great twist, eh?

630
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:38,332
Okay.

631
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,365
Just calm down.

632
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:48,612
I have only come to pay what I owe.

633
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,112
Fuck...

634
01:09:52,053 --> 01:09:54,521
You've grown a conscience all of
a sudden?

635
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:57,823
You didn't seem to mind fucking
another man's wife.

636
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:06,022
Suit yourself, but I need the camera back.

637
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:09,162
Take it and get out.

638
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:13,969
- And the others.
- Others?

639
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,044
Yeah, well, I can't let you keep it, kid.

640
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,979
It's far too expensive.
You must understand that.

641
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:22,573
Not in my fucking flat.

642
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,379
It's a bedsit, Kit.

643
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,665
This is really good stuff.

644
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:46,536
Carmen, I swear I know nothing
about this.

645
01:10:46,608 --> 01:10:49,133
No, there he is telling you the truth.

646
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,041
If I'd told him about the hidden cameras...

647
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:53,103
his performance wouldn't have been
so authentic.

648
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:54,808
And believe me...

649
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:58,848
that's about as authentic as it gets.

650
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,283
- When we met...
- She speaks.

651
01:11:05,193 --> 01:11:07,718
...did you have it planned already?

652
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:10,223
Honey, try and keep up.

653
01:11:11,165 --> 01:11:13,463
It's why we met.

654
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,900
The moment I saw you,
I knew I'd found my character.

655
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:25,511
Tempestuous, vulnerable...

656
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:27,374
needy.

657
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,479
Why are you so good to me?

658
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:33,315
And then when I found out
about this psycho ex-boyfriend of hers...

659
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:36,255
and the acid attack, perfect.

660
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:39,526
It is brilliant casting on my part,
you must admit.

661
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:42,955
I mean, the girl's a complete fuck-up.

662
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,362
What? You want me to feel bad?

663
01:11:50,805 --> 01:11:51,931
I'm...

664
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:55,306
an artist.

665
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:58,738
Does a painter feel for his paint?

666
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:04,545
You want a little sprinkling of
Freudian motivation.

667
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:05,984
Might help.

668
01:12:07,355 --> 01:12:09,721
Let me see, what can I tell you?

669
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:12,388
That I grew up alone?

670
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:16,956
That my parents threw money at me
instead of love?

671
01:12:17,031 --> 01:12:19,261
That I was shunted
from one nanny to another...

672
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,859
from one heartless boarding school
to the next?

673
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:24,461
That I was
taught to be emotionally frigid?

674
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,832
Well, fuck that.

675
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:31,038
I did it because I was bored.

676
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:33,504
Because I could.

677
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:36,175
Because I had the time and the money.

678
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:40,014
I did it because people like me...

679
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:44,724
get to play with the lives of people
like you.

680
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:50,130
Because you so desperately wanted
to believe in love.

681
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:09,375
Just got out of hand, didn't it?

682
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:15,855
You went and kissed each other...

683
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:18,818
like you weren't meant to kiss each other.

684
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:27,661
You never kissed me like that.

685
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:32,567
Not once.

686
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:43,813
I suppose that that is why I...

687
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:57,722
- Fuck me, I'm good.
- What the fuck?

688
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:00,962
I just thought a little tearful confession
would come in useful, you know.

689
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:04,163
Cut it into the film somewhere,
but that's the last one.

690
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:06,535
Trust me.

691
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:12,837
I just realized.

692
01:14:13,648 --> 01:14:14,740
What?

693
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:17,615
Nobody ever is gonna see your film.

694
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:19,811
And why is that?

695
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:22,854
Because you need a release form
from Carmen.

696
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,892
You need her permission.

697
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:29,253
Making a film is all about organization.

698
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,227
You've got to think of everything.

699
01:14:37,238 --> 01:14:39,103
Cross the "T's" and...

700
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:42,337
dot the "I's."

701
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:52,286
You'll thank me one day.

702
01:15:54,782 --> 01:15:57,342
How do you feel about being nominated
for the award...

703
01:15:57,418 --> 01:15:59,079
at the 3rd Indie-Vision Festival?

704
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,383
I gotta tell you, it's a buzz.

705
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:04,180
It's a great honor.

706
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:09,554
More than I could've hoped for
with this, my first film.

707
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,029
But I had a wonderful cast, a good
team around me, so...

708
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:15,564
- Sorry.
- Sorry, what?

709
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:18,469
Are we excited
about tonight's proceedings?

710
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:20,403
Of course, we're very happy...

711
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:23,466
that "Dot the I" has been nominated
for an award tonight.

712
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:26,012
Everybody's invited.
There's no hard feelings between us.

713
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,513
We're all great friends now.

714
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,415
I think everyone's very proud of our
achievements.

715
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:34,647
Especially as it was our idea in the
first place.

716
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:37,451
And the film has been doing so
wonderfully well...

717
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:39,425
on the film-festival circuit.

718
01:16:39,493 --> 01:16:43,327
Of course, we wanna get it out there,
you know, into the cinemas.

719
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:47,394
Well, this evening's proceedings should
bring us a lot of publicity.

720
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:50,631
Yes, well, we want a hit.
Absolutely, yeah.

721
01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:55,671
Okay, good. One more like that.

722
01:16:58,713 --> 01:16:59,941
Sorry, what?

723
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,045
When we were making the movie...

724
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:05,916
Carmen didn't know she was in the film,
and she was, understandably...

725
01:17:06,654 --> 01:17:08,679
a little freaked out at the time.

726
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:10,451
And then time went by...

727
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:12,316
and I quietly went to work.

728
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:15,453
And I cut together
a really moving performance.

729
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:18,592
And I showed it to her. She loved it.

730
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:22,097
Well, of course she loved it.
She's beautiful in it. She's wonderful.

731
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:25,570
It was like six or seven months of
pent-up emotion...

732
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,268
suddenly flowed out of her.

733
01:17:30,645 --> 01:17:34,638
And I took her in my arms
after the screening, gave her a cuddle.

734
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:39,409
I think we made a connection that was
deeper than anything we had in the film.

735
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:42,422
Something very real now between
Carmen and me.

736
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,354
And so now
we come to the Newcomer Award.

737
01:17:46,127 --> 01:17:48,095
And I'm pleased to say that in this
category...

738
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:52,121
the judging panel have come
to a completely unanimous decision.

739
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:55,901
This award goes to a film which is...

740
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,402
uncompromising and remarkable.

741
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:01,606
It is an extraordinary achievement.

742
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:06,136
A tragic love story which is startling
in its authenticity and realism.

743
01:18:06,514 --> 01:18:08,209
- Put it on automatic.
- What?

744
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:11,410
It gives me great pleasure
to present the Newcomer Award...

745
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:14,283
to Barnaby F. Caspian for "Dot the I"!

746
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:16,152
- You're gonna miss him.
- I can handle it.

747
01:18:16,223 --> 01:18:18,384
Put the fucking thing on automatic.

748
01:18:56,297 --> 01:18:58,959
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

749
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,557
He's got a gun!

750
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,870
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

751
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:07,066
- Did you get the shot?
- I think so.

752
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:10,310
- Did you get the shot, Theo?
- I got it.

753
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:11,605
Good.

754
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:18,148
Barnaby?

755
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:32,995
- You wanna tell us what's going on?
- I wish I knew.

756
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:36,059
You're gonna have to do better
than that, son.

757
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:42,569
It was Tom and Theo's idea...

758
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:45,235
the whole film.

759
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:51,877
And they thought it would be a great idea
if the film spilled over into real life.

760
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,247
Go on.

761
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:59,023
The plan was that I was...

762
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:05,489
supposed to be upset because Carmen
was back with Barnaby.

763
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,227
I would seek my revenge in his
moment of glory.

764
01:20:09,603 --> 01:20:12,128
I was going to pretend to shoot him.

765
01:20:12,673 --> 01:20:16,939
And he was going to pretend to go down.
Just for the cameras, you know?

766
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:22,612
Then I would get jumped on, and we'd
let it go on just for a little while...

767
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:25,751
until the whole ceremony descended
into chaos.

768
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,847
Then he would get up, and that was it.
We'd all have a good laugh.

769
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:31,953
What was the point?

770
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:34,923
What was the point? Publicity.

771
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:40,490
The stunt would hit the news,
and you can't buy that kind of publicity.

772
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:45,428
Tom and Theo thought that the film
would be a hit off the back of it.

773
01:20:49,143 --> 01:20:52,203
- This is a starter pistol.
- I know.

774
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,378
- It only fires blanks.
- I know.

775
01:20:56,784 --> 01:21:01,244
Then if you shot him with a starter pistol,
perhaps you could explain to me...

776
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:04,814
how Barnaby is lying in a hospital bed
fighting for his life.

777
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,556
All I know is that that was the plan.

778
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:11,120
That's why I was given the starter pistol.

779
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:14,497
- You can't go in there, love. Sorry.
- No, he's my husband.

780
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:18,698
You know, maybe you should talk to
Tom and Theo. It was their idea.

781
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:22,804
And, you know,
they were always a little bit nuts.

782
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:26,876
I don't know,
maybe they took the stunt to heart.

783
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:38,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

784
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:41,288
I don't know anything about no
publicity stunt.

785
01:21:56,543 --> 01:21:58,340
Is this camera yours?

786
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:04,675
Yes.

787
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:07,415
And this?

788
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:17,895
- This has nothing to do with us.
- They found it in the ballroom.

789
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:20,160
- Another starting pistol?
- No.

790
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:22,364
It's an automatic. Guess what?

791
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:25,064
- It's recently been fired.
- So?

792
01:22:25,506 --> 01:22:27,667
I've never seen that fucking thing
in my life.

793
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:31,142
Then perhaps you could explain why
it has your fingerprints all over it.

794
01:22:31,211 --> 01:22:33,042
- What?
- No, I swear.

795
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:34,273
I swear.

796
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:37,644
Let's have a look at this, shall we?

797
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:45,086
And tonight's proceedings
should bring us a lot of publicity.

798
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:47,657
Because, you know, we want a hit.

799
01:22:47,728 --> 01:22:48,752
Absolutely.

800
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:49,887
Sir.

801
01:22:56,937 --> 01:23:00,031
Well, boys,
you're in a whole heap of trouble.

802
01:23:01,308 --> 01:23:02,775
Barnaby's dead.

803
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:09,683
So what have we got?

804
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:13,620
To present the Newcomer Award...

805
01:23:13,687 --> 01:23:16,349
Put it on automatic.
You're gonna miss the shot.

806
01:23:16,423 --> 01:23:18,254
- You're gonna miss him.
- I can handle it.

807
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:20,486
Put the fucking thing on automatic.

808
01:23:57,898 --> 01:24:00,924
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

809
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:02,332
He's got a gun.

810
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:06,131
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

811
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:08,197
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you get the shot, Theo?

812
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:10,266
- I think so.
- Did you get it?

813
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:12,602
- I got it.
- Good.

814
01:24:42,843 --> 01:24:44,811
Theo, what the fuck have you done?

815
01:24:44,878 --> 01:24:48,473
I swear I found it in my pocket.
Honest, I don't know where it came from.

816
01:24:48,549 --> 01:24:51,143
What the fuck have you done?

817
01:24:51,218 --> 01:24:54,016
I think you should get yourselves a lawyer.

818
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:57,237
Have you been following the
Tom and Theo trial?

819
01:26:57,978 --> 01:26:59,468
Do you miss Barnaby?

820
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:02,007
Carmen, who made your dress?

821
01:27:04,785 --> 01:27:06,047
Get that camera out of here!

822
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:35,324
Dot the I passes the $50 million mark.

823
01:29:35,402 --> 01:29:36,892
It's a lot of money.

824
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,207
What are you doing?

825
01:29:44,678 --> 01:29:46,509
You got any papers in there?
