1
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:36,902
"Save the planet."

2
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,378
Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,
I've had to laugh.

3
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,918
"Save the planet."

4
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:46,680
What for?

5
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:49,153
And from what, ourselves?

6
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:54,426
What about God?
Can he help us?

7
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,325
I don't think so.

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,093
God gave us what we have
to see how we'll use it.

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,169
Shit. Rats in a cage
would've done it better.

10
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,901
"Life's a bitch
and then you die."

11
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,272
Bumper-sticker philosophy.

12
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,014
Yeah, right.

13
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:17,913
Sometimes...

14
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,946
you get a second chance.

15
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:26,117
For hundreds of thousands
of people commuting to the Iranian capital...

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,245
this morning began
just like any other.

17
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:31,518
At least 52 people died,
along with four bombers...

18
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,525
and 700 were injured.

19
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,755
If the chief U.S. interest at this point
is in combating terrorism...

20
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,957
as it emanates
from Kazakhstan...

21
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:42,331
there really isn't anyone
to deal with other than-

22
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:45,030
Since Kazakhstan's
independence six years ago-

23
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:53,078
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

24
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,705
Two-two with
the triple fat goose

25
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,580
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

26
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:01,416
You, you ain't
never seen a bigger threat

27
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:04,855
Deuces is wild getting
willy off a bag of ily

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,756
Iced out on the sand
like a chilly willy

29
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,159
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

30
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,630
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

31
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,827
In this world that's been frozen
they come be Achozen

32
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,530
Rising from the dead
Overthrow the opposin'

33
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,335
Forces of evil
controlling our people

34
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,104
Deuces is wild
and their wisdom is lethal

35
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:27,305
Four twenty-two stomping
through I can see you

36
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,974
Strike a match, light the sun
Watch the preview

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,575
Life is a game played once
Don't refuse to

38
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:35,382
Three is the view
and life we are true to

39
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,923
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

40
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,653
Two-two with the triple fat goose

41
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:43,628
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

42
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,892
You, you ain't
never seen a bigger threat

43
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,365
This is how I really talk

44
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,697
Fuck what you really thought

45
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,567
Now I'm really pop
Shit talk silly pot

46
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,970
I'd like to kill the cat

47
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:56,304
Ice like the polar caps
jawra is ily raw

48
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,037
So fast you kill my rap

49
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,409
Your phantom power
My anthem will strike the power

50
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,142
The truths of which I write
and will be sanctum power

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,514
It's how I spit my night
to this very time

52
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:08,554
An hour with disrespect
A light we shine

53
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,487
Get out here!

54
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,963
Come here!

55
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:21,864
Get back!

56
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,939
You remember me?

57
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,098
You sold me a gun
that don't work.

58
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,769
It almost got me killed. I paid $20
for this. I want my money back.

59
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,244
Give me that.

60
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,486
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

61
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,183
Two-two with
the triple fat goose

62
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,193
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

63
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,490
You, you ain't
never seen a bigger threat

64
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,980
Okay.

65
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:31,032
I owe you.

66
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:34,665
I'll save you some.

67
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,285
Hey, Toorop. Toorop.
Somebody came by looking for you.

68
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,529
Okay.

69
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,442
If the chief U.S. interest
at this point is in combating terrorism...

70
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,568
that emanates from Kazakhstan-

71
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,442
Boy, what a massacre.

72
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,184
The victims were killed
as they were visiting the factory...

73
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,222
in a northeastern
Kazakhstan province.

74
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:58,917
The blast went off as the-

75
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,527
At the peak
of the rush hour, bombs were detonated...

76
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,862
in three crowded trains
and aboard a bus.

77
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,936
At least 50-

78
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,660
Toorop.

79
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:50,601
Karl, is that you?

80
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,441
I thought you were in Sudan,
killing babies.

81
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,072
Remember the last time we met?

82
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,347
I told you if you ever point
that gun at me again...

83
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,751
I'd kill you.

84
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:07,515
Who would hire
a baby killer to get me-

85
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,623
Who?

86
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:17,693
No shit, Karl.

87
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:20,932
If you wanted me dead, you would've
blown up the building. Who?

88
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,373
Gorsky.

89
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:30,047
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

90
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,675
You're not a mercenary.
You're a fucking terrorist.

91
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,018
your balls and your word.

92
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,184
You don't have either.

93
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,692
Know the difference
between you and me, Karl?

94
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,024
I still got both.

95
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:53,033
Take it easy.

96
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,576
That was just personal
between him and me.

97
00:08:57,744 --> 00:09:00,235
Let me get my things.

98
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:27,505
Amateurs.

99
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:30,639
Toorop.

100
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,778
- See you, kid.
- Thank you, Toorop.

101
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,814
You are a hard man
to find, Toorop.

102
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,717
I'm not hiding.

103
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,153
Mm-hmm.

104
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,225
You could've knocked.

105
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:57,554
I needed to be sure
that you were the same idealist...

106
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:00,258
who worked for me 10 years ago.

107
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:04,502
So you knew
I was gonna kill Karl.

108
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,265
Hmm.

109
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,568
- I don't like you, Gorsky.
- Hmm.

110
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:11,337
You can't trust me,
and I can't trust you.

111
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:13,639
This is not about trust.

112
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:17,911
This is about, uh,
professionalism...

113
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:19,576
ethics.

114
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,313
- Ethics?
- Hmm.

115
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,879
If it's about ethics, I should kill you right now.

116
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:28,427
And you think that would make
the world a better place?

117
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:31,895
Look at you, still in this shit-hole.

118
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:34,728
Surviving.
Sleeping with your gun.

119
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:38,167
No friends,
no family, no future.

120
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,829
We are the same.

121
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,703
You and me.

122
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,801
We're not the same.
What do you want?

123
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,403
I need a smuggler.

124
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,915
I don't
do refugees anymore.

125
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:52,279
Use your own cargo.

126
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:55,320
- You own the borders anyway.
- Only on this side.

127
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:58,585
- This is an overseas delivery?
- A girl.

128
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,559
She needs to be
in America in six days.

129
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,323
Why are you playing with me?

130
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,229
You know I can't get back
into that country.

131
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,565
You know that U.N. passports
are impossible to fake.

132
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:19,443
This is not a fake.

133
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:23,710
Inject it in your neck
when you pass the official border.

134
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:26,149
This is your new life.

135
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,244
Clean credit.

136
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:30,789
John Doe.

137
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,420
What's the catch?

138
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,495
You have to make a choice.

139
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,069
That's the catch.

140
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:53,345
I'll do it for half a mil.

141
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,607
I can make you do it for free.

142
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:59,207
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

143
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,618
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

144
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,820
You got yourself
a deal.

145
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:10,088
A car will
pick you up outside...

146
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,756
to take you
to the rendezvous point.

147
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:17,894
Cross me, and you'll have
no place to hide anymore...

148
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,029
Toorop.

149
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,334
Hmm?

150
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,103
That goes both ways...

151
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,373
- Gorsky.
- Huh.

152
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:24,591
Shit.

153
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,811
Good morning.

154
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,940
You must be Toorop.

155
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,018
I am Sister Rebeka.

156
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,644
I just want to bring three simple rules
to your attention...

157
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,723
before we start our journey.

158
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,222
We?

159
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm here to pick up one girl.

160
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,487
Wherever she goes, I go.
That is rule number one.

161
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:39,997
Rule number two:

162
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:43,068
the less contact she has
with the outside world, the better.

163
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,865
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

164
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:49,703
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

165
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,105
You know, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

166
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:56,272
I know. That is
why we live in here.

167
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:00,850
Ah, shit, okay.
What's your third rule?

168
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,854
No foul language.

169
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:08,060
Do we have an agreement?

170
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,161
You listen to my one and only rule.

171
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,932
Don't fuck with me...

172
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,202
or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

173
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,676
with nothing but your ass to sell
to get back here.

174
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,770
Your perfect world.

175
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,817
Do we have an agreement?

176
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,820
Obviously,
you are not a gentleman.

177
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,650
Obviously not.

178
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,352
Now that we have an understanding,
pick up the bags.

179
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,160
No.

180
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:53,561
Shit.

181
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,225
- What's your name?
- My name?

182
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:22,624
You don't have
to talk to him.

183
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,754
You didn't introduce yourself.

184
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,827
My name's Toorop.

185
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,836
Are you taking us to New York?

186
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:34,429
Yes. Now, please, get into the car.

187
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,444
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

188
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:43,778
Look, lady, I'm just a delivery boy.

189
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,408
And to me, you'rejust a package.

190
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,148
I'm not your friend. I'm not your brother.
I'm not your boyfriend.

191
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:54,215
In six days, I'm gonna deliver you
and never see you again.

192
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,693
Sister Rebeka's right.

193
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,855
We shouldn't even talk.

194
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,592
Come on.

195
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:08,365
Comfy?

196
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,184
You wouldn't have a light, would you?

197
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:24,920
Figures.

198
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:50,407
Are you okay, baby girl?

199
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:52,916
I've never been this far.

200
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:07,592
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

201
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:11,428
Take your bags.

202
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:15,459
Are you really going
to need all that?

203
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:18,366
We could never have
enough firepower, Sister.

204
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,336
In fact-

205
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,839
I've never touched a gun in my life.

206
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,967
Now would be
the perfect moment to start.

207
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:28,171
No, thank you.
I can defend myself.

208
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,681
Stay close. This is the real world.

209
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:33,081
There's no mercy for the weak.

210
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:36,245
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

211
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:38,323
It does here.

212
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,064
Take this.

213
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:54,401
- Hurry.
- Here.

214
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,702
- Change.
- What are you doing?

215
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:06,176
That's him. We're locked on.

216
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:08,412
He's a big motherfucker. Look at him.

217
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,216
That won't be a problem.

218
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,959
- And that's Aurora.
- She's cute.

219
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,120
- Put this on.
- Let's stay concentrated, guys.

220
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,221
Come on.

221
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:16,521
What do we do now?

222
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,988
No need to rush. Let's give it time.

223
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:21,389
Hang on.

224
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:23,894
Okay, give me three.

225
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:29,027
Hey.

226
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,832
Where are you going?

227
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,554
What are you doing?
Come on.

228
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:21,042
Hey! Hey!

229
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,912
Hey, come here! Hey!

230
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,371
- Hey, something's happening. She's on the run.
- Hey!

231
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,137
Aurora! Toorop!

232
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,272
Aurora!

233
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:58,489
Don't go. You will die.

234
00:26:58,591 --> 00:26:59,990
- What are you doing?
- She's felt it.

235
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:02,060
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

236
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,221
- We have to go now. We have no time.
- We have to get away.

237
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,959
What is wrong with you?
Make her walk, or I'll carry her.

238
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,932
- Stop. Don't touch her.
- Don't go that way.

239
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:11,730
- We're going now.
- We have to get away.

240
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,566
Don't touch her.

241
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:29,210
Come on.

242
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,587
We'll go to the train.

243
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:39,789
We need to catch it.
Come on.

244
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:12,561
Come on. Move. Move.
Get out of the way. Move!

245
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,064
Hey, guys, can I buy
these three seats off you?

246
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,540
Buy some more goats.

247
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,677
For you.

248
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,615
Those tigers in the cage-

249
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:11,121
they weren't real, right?

250
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,794
Siberian tigers
went extinct in 2017.

251
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,729
The last one died
in the Moscow Zoo.

252
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,196
What is she,
a walking wildlife encyclopedia?

253
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:27,705
They were clones?

254
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:32,409
Second-generation clones,
not real tigers.

255
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:33,842
Copies of copies.

256
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:37,541
But they're living creatures,
made by God.

257
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,552
No. They were organic
machines made by man.

258
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,384
But God made man
in his image.

259
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,426
So what man creates
is also God's will.

260
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,757
Is this what you
teach her in the convent?

261
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:54,799
Then God would be pretty
fucked up to make man in his image.

262
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,666
You wanna talk? Tell me what
happened at the marketplace.

263
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:05,031
If I'm gonna protect you...

264
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:07,476
I need to know
what's wrong with you.

265
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,848
She was scared.

266
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:13,577
It's the first time
out of the convent...

267
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,847
and you put us
in that situation.

268
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:26,526
First time
out of the convent, huh?

269
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:30,193
So I'm probably delivering you
to some billionaire playboy...

270
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,100
who purchased you
off the Internet.

271
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,173
Stay close.

272
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,849
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a friend.

273
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,169
Come on. Come on.

274
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:13,431
Sit over there.

275
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:18,162
I'll be right there in a minute.
And, you, don't talk to anybody.

276
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,135
Yo, guys.
They're separating.

277
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,639
Don't do anything stupid. Wait.

278
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,209
- Get up, motherfucker.
- Huh?

279
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:28,438
Hey! Toorop!

280
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:31,277
How are you?

281
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:34,819
- How you doing?
- What you doing in this beautiful part of Russia?

282
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,478
Working.

283
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:39,284
Working for who?
Hey, hey. Two shots.

284
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:41,882
- Hold your positions. We're gonna move in.
- Gorsky.

285
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:49,626
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

286
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,465
What can I do for you?

287
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,267
I need three passes
on the boat...

288
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,501
and two snow bikes
on the other side.

289
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:00,373
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering.

290
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:03,037
The girl.

291
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:07,080
Her? Who is she?

292
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,812
I don't know.

293
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,152
- Where you taking her?
- America.

294
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:15,192
- What America? You're on a terrorist list there.
- Yeah.

295
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,421
You need a passport.
You need an identity.

296
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,589
You're kidding me.
You got a passport?

297
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,191
- Yeah, and I'm not coming back.
- That is a bold move.

298
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,703
I got 50 G's saying
you can help me out.

299
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,670
When?

300
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:30,332
Now.

301
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:41,586
You don't have to look.

302
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:51,029
Who is he?

303
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:52,756
He's a lost soul.

304
00:34:57,302 --> 00:34:59,532
See you at the landing
at 0600 sharp.

305
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:02,198
You got it.

306
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:04,468
- Who was that?
- An old friend. A good smuggler.

307
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,977
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anybody. Come on.

308
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:14,742
Sorry, kids.
These girls are with me.

309
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:17,913
- Just let her go, Toorop.
- How do you know my name?

310
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:20,491
- We know a lot of things you don't know.
- Yeah? Like what?

311
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:22,389
Like you don't know
what you're doing.

312
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:25,725
- I'm doing my job.
- Fuck your job.

313
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,197
- What?
- One million, tax free.

314
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:35,299
Take the money
and walk out without a fight.

315
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:38,001
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

316
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,917
Aurora!

317
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,413
Toorop!

318
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:01,151
No! Toorop!

319
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,193
No!

320
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:23,879
Hey.

321
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:27,076
- Aurora!
- Hey, man, let the girl go.

322
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,050
Just let her go.
Let her go.

323
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,330
Hey, man.
Hey. Hey. I don't-

324
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,028
No!

325
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:52,065
Get over there!
You wanna fight?

326
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:54,338
Okay, man.

327
00:38:24,776 --> 00:38:26,801
Come on!

328
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:39,083
Come on!

329
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:11,181
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

330
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,883
Stop it! Stop!

331
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:17,994
Don't kill him!

332
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:23,765
He doesn't want to hurt me.

333
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:32,404
He wanted to protect me!

334
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:37,207
- Your father sent us.
- My father?

335
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,512
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

336
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,086
It's okay, Aurora.

337
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,686
- I have to know.
- No.

338
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,017
Aurora!

339
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,386
Aurora.

340
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:49,687
Aurora! Aurora!
Listen to me. Stop!

341
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:52,422
Toorop! Toorop!

342
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:02,264
Come on.

343
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:21,924
Let's go. Hurry up.

344
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:27,159
Move it.

345
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:29,563
Come on!

346
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,397
Go! Go!

347
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:48,549
Stop!

348
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:53,790
Let her go!

349
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:02,426
Next one dies!

350
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:08,000
Come with us.
They're ready to die for you.

351
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,074
I don't want anybody
to die for me.

352
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:29,692
What do you think
you're doing?

353
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,092
- What's wrong with you?
- You think this is a game?

354
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,324
- Why did you shoot them?
- You trying to get us killed?

355
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,093
- Why didn't you let me go?
- You don't know them!

356
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,533
Well, what are you gonna do,
shoot me in the head?

357
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:41,104
- Shoot me like an animal?
- Stop it!

358
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:52,474
I told you I'd take you
to New York, and I will.

359
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,895
This is way too many refugees, man.

360
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:42,057
The ice is getting
thinner every year.

361
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,692
They're losing cargo
all the time.

362
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:50,365
We're not gonna all
get on the boat.

363
00:42:50,475 --> 00:42:53,069
Make sure we do.

364
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:56,773
Ah, this goddamn global warming's
bad for business.

365
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:12,353
What's happening?

366
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,056
Watch this.

367
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:59,035
There's not much time.

368
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:01,078
They don't wanna be
spotted by satellites.

369
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,306
Hurry. Come on!

370
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:36,205
Come on!

371
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,621
Move!

372
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:49,124
Come on!

373
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,228
No!

374
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:35,031
No!

375
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,668
You can't do this!
They'll die out there!

376
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:41,335
No!

377
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:45,672
- You can't do this.
- Get away from the controls.

378
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:48,081
- What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it.
- No!

379
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:51,519
- Don't do that. What's wrong?
- Put it down.

380
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,091
- No. Don't.
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

381
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:57,355
- Take it easy.
- Hey, take it easy.

382
00:45:57,462 --> 00:45:59,521
We go back up.

383
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,326
Now.

384
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:02,922
Okay. Okay.

385
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:04,934
Relax.

386
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:07,231
- We go back up.
- Easy.

387
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:08,566
Now.

388
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:10,106
Relax.

389
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,505
Calm down.

390
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,304
I feel them!

391
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,470
I feel them!

392
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,980
I feel them dying!

393
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:20,380
I feel them dying!

394
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:25,113
The whole Bering Sea is dead!

395
00:46:33,264 --> 00:46:37,166
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the fuck was that?

396
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:50,373
I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco.

397
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,779
My life was a mess.

398
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:55,079
I met the wrong man.

399
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,814
I was lost in darkness.

400
00:46:57,922 --> 00:47:00,982
But then the high priestess
of our church opened the doors...

401
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:03,583
that led me
on to the path oflight.

402
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,221
I joined the Noelites...

403
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:11,166
and I ended up in the convent.

404
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:15,035
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

405
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:18,840
I worked in the orphanage.

406
00:47:21,145 --> 00:47:23,477
She arrived.

407
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:26,015
A little baby.

408
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:29,378
Her father was dead.

409
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,785
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

410
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:35,120
I took her as my own.

411
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:38,218
I fed her. I taught her.

412
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:40,729
Everything was fine...

413
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,300
until three months ago.

414
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:45,961
The doctor came.
He gave her a pill.

415
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,970
He was with her
for 10 minutes...

416
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,506
and then she slowly
started to change.

417
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:54,840
But nothing- nothing as violent
as what you saw today.

418
00:47:54,946 --> 00:47:57,676
But something's not making sense.

419
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:04,153
How could she know how to operate
a 30-year-old Russian sub?

420
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:11,425
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

421
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:15,590
Aurora could speak
when she was two years old.

422
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,932
- A lot of kids speak at two-
- Nineteen different languages.

423
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:27,044
Who else knows about this?

424
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:29,204
Nobody but the doctor.

425
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:32,111
He told me to keep it a secret
to protect her.

426
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,453
He said...

427
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:40,354
that we would get
the best medical help in America.

428
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:44,592
She needs help.

429
00:48:50,735 --> 00:48:52,760
Get her ready.

430
00:49:10,888 --> 00:49:15,086
You know, two years ago,
in Uzbekistan...

431
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:17,661
I saw this viral bomb go off.

432
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:19,923
It was, uh-

433
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:24,431
It was incredible.
Everybody died.

434
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:31,802
She's carrying, ain't she?

435
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:33,308
Huh?

436
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:37,313
All the symptoms fit.
All that weird behavior.

437
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:40,612
I'm telling you, man,
she is carrying a weapon.

438
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:48,115
You have any idea
how much money she's worth?

439
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:52,660
If she's carrying a virus...

440
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,201
I'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

441
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:33,534
- What happened to them?
- Fighter drones.

442
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:35,196
Anything that moves
is shot on sight.

443
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:37,240
Now we're in the zone.
It's 10 miles to the D.M.Z.

444
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:39,901
Then let's make it
10 fast miles. Let's go!

445
00:50:58,095 --> 00:50:59,858
Toorop, they're coming!

446
00:50:59,964 --> 00:51:01,727
Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!

447
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:12,769
Break!

448
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:20,216
Finn, get close to me! Finn, now!

449
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:22,582
Aurora, jump onto our bike.

450
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:30,353
I'll draw them off.
You three, hide here.

451
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:02,424
What are you doing?

452
00:52:02,526 --> 00:52:06,394
Toorop cleared our way out.
We're almost at the border.

453
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,737
Toorop, we need you now!

454
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:26,476
It's gonna shoot us!
Toorop. Toorop!

455
00:52:32,623 --> 00:52:33,590
Stop!

456
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:55,804
Toorop!

457
00:52:58,582 --> 00:52:59,981
He's not dead!

458
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:03,285
Ah, shit!

459
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:05,218
Hey, stay with me.

460
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:10,023
He's not reacting.
He's bleeding to death.

461
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:13,392
I need your help. Okay.

462
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,568
We gotta get outta here now.

463
00:53:18,669 --> 00:53:21,536
It's a small piece of metal.
I'm gonna take it out.

464
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:24,199
- What do you need?
- Just hold him.

465
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:29,002
Look, we don't have time for this, okay?

466
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:30,910
They're gonna send more drones!

467
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:32,983
Aurora?

468
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:36,915
- You got it?
- I got it.

469
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:38,886
- It's okay.
- Give me a bandage.

470
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:41,287
We should never have turned back.

471
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,760
He knows the rules.

472
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:47,558
I'll sew it up later.

473
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,199
Hey!

474
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:53,827
Now you and the passport
are mine.

475
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,702
- What are you doing?
- You, I don't need.

476
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,019
Like I said,
trust no one.

477
00:54:29,874 --> 00:54:33,469
It's good.
Where did you learn to cook?

478
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:35,442
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

479
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:37,537
You never had a woman
take care of you?

480
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:38,546
Ow!

481
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:42,284
Sorry.

482
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:44,650
No, not in my line of work.

483
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:48,555
- Ah!
- Oh- Finished.

484
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:51,093
She gets pleasure out of this.

485
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:55,325
- Crybaby.
- Crybaby?

486
00:54:55,432 --> 00:54:57,423
Mmm.

487
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:00,803
Ooh. What is that?

488
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:05,237
- Painkiller?
- No, thank you.

489
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:08,470
- Live a little.
- No.

490
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,479
Aurora, stop!

491
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:14,278
Spit it out.

492
00:55:14,385 --> 00:55:17,252
Ah!

493
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:20,482
Yuck! Hmm.

494
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:24,857
Girls, we made it
across the border.

495
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:26,759
Here's to survival.

496
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:30,158
And thank you
for saving my life.

497
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:32,599
Maybe now
you can trust somebody.

498
00:55:35,472 --> 00:55:38,964
We protected each other,
like family.

499
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:45,878
We are all going to die
in New York.

500
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,024
Good night.

501
00:56:05,402 --> 00:56:07,393
She's just scared.

502
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:10,773
Yeah, right.

503
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:50,747
Go back to sleep.

504
00:56:52,149 --> 00:56:54,947
We still have
a long way ahead of us.

505
00:56:55,052 --> 00:56:57,452
What are you doing?

506
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:02,251
We go through
customs tomorrow.

507
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:04,418
I can't take these.

508
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:18,501
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first held me as a baby...

509
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:20,873
it was a night like this.

510
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:24,403
Aurora-

511
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:26,847
that's where I got my name.

512
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:30,318
- From the chaos.
- It suits you.

513
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:37,060
You're risking
your life for me. Why?

514
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,630
I've done my time.

515
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:47,231
All this killing
and pain and... war-

516
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,805
For what?

517
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:52,341
I'm tired-

518
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:56,406
tired of it all.

519
00:57:56,513 --> 00:57:59,073
And you're my only chance
out of this hell.

520
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:00,741
And go where?

521
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:05,481
27 Cedar Grove.

522
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,521
Near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

523
00:58:10,627 --> 00:58:13,118
My parents had a farm-

524
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:17,861
more like a cabin
with a lot of land.

525
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:22,329
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

526
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:28,170
There is no place like home.

527
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:35,877
But Kansas ain't
what it used to be.

528
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:37,886
The Wizard of Oz.

529
00:58:37,988 --> 00:58:41,446
1939.

530
00:58:41,558 --> 00:58:43,458
That's right.

531
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,068
Toorop?

532
00:58:56,373 --> 00:58:59,604
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

533
00:59:02,346 --> 00:59:04,246
I hope I won't have to.

534
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:39,875
You have reached the limit of your water credit.

535
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:43,146
To purchase more credit,
enter your room number now.

536
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:14,272
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

537
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:17,939
Last plane to New York
in two hours.

538
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,207
Your Highness,
they've crossed the Canadian border.

539
01:01:51,481 --> 01:01:53,381
She's coming.

540
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:55,747
Let's pray.

541
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,908
A miracle in the making.

542
01:02:58,482 --> 01:03:02,043
Trust. Invest in our new faith.

543
01:03:12,229 --> 01:03:15,790
Tomorrow is the dawn of our new age.

544
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,000
Right here, girls.

545
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,812
Welcome, Mr.Johnson.

546
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:08,441
Your multimedia system
is loading.

547
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:10,816
- We wish you a pleasant stay.
- It's okay.

548
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:13,355
It's safe here.

549
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:38,179
Here.

550
01:04:51,928 --> 01:04:54,726
Hey, there's no food.

551
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:57,891
Guess we're not
gonna be here long.

552
01:05:08,678 --> 01:05:11,772
- What's wrong?
- They are all dead.

553
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:17,483
Sources report the destruction in Kyrgyzstan...

554
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,612
of a 1 ,000-year-old convent...

555
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:24,126
one of the oldest continually functioning
convents in Central Asia.

556
01:05:24,227 --> 01:05:26,957
Now occupied by
an ascetic branch of the Noelites...

557
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:29,531
the convent was struck
by a missile late last night.

558
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:31,533
There were no survivors.

559
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:34,695
Here, an initial reaction
from the Noelites.

560
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:38,297
It is a tragedy
to think that even defenseless women...

561
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:40,808
who made the choice
to withdraw from society...

562
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:42,811
and lead a life of purity...

563
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:45,040
should suffer
the attacks of terrorists...

564
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:49,710
who have absolutely no respect for
the lives of decent, God-fearing people.

565
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:54,250
We shall mourn our sisters...

566
01:05:54,357 --> 01:05:56,757
and continue their legacy
for world peace...

567
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,887
through obedience,
purification and hope...

568
01:06:00,997 --> 01:06:03,522
for the miracle
we so desperately need.

569
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:13,008
Congratulations, my friend.

570
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:16,840
- You made it safe and sound.
- Gorsky.

571
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,847
Did you destroy that convent?

572
01:06:18,949 --> 01:06:22,407
I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.
I'm a mercenary, like you.

573
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:25,818
Bullshit.
What the hell is going-

574
01:06:25,922 --> 01:06:27,822
What the hell
is going on over here?

575
01:06:27,924 --> 01:06:30,620
- You didn't leave me a gun.
- You've done yourjob.

576
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,854
A doctor is coming
in a few minutes.

577
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:35,124
If she's okay,
you're home free...

578
01:06:35,232 --> 01:06:39,293
and the tracking device
in your passport will be deactivated.

579
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:41,927
Don't make us use it.

580
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,144
Sometimes it's hard to understand...

581
01:06:49,246 --> 01:06:55,014
but I believe God has a reason
for everything that happens.

582
01:06:55,118 --> 01:06:57,348
What reason could there be?

583
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:01,691
They never hurt anybody.

584
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,894
Maybe it was
an accident.

585
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:08,123
It was not an accident.

586
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:13,025
It was destroyed right after
we crossed the border.

587
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:17,896
Would you like
to pray with me?

588
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:21,840
I don't feel
like praying anymore.

589
01:07:34,357 --> 01:07:37,121
Toorop said
I'm just a package to him.

590
01:07:40,163 --> 01:07:42,222
Why did you bring me here?

591
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:50,506
'Cause I couldn't
take care of you anymore.

592
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,789
How is she?

593
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:11,554
Scared.

594
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:15,290
Yeah. Well, she should be.

595
01:08:15,398 --> 01:08:17,889
- Who are they?
- To the left...

596
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:20,970
the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

597
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:25,599
To the right,
the bikers work for Gorsky.

598
01:08:31,314 --> 01:08:33,976
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

599
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:37,815
And if we don't?

600
01:08:40,624 --> 01:08:42,649
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

601
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,163
Look, Sister...

602
01:08:48,264 --> 01:08:51,062
we traveled
6,000 miles together.

603
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:54,227
The truth is this has been
a suicide mission from the beginning.

604
01:08:54,337 --> 01:08:57,738
They won't let either one of us
walk out of here alive.

605
01:08:57,841 --> 01:09:01,277
- That's why they destroyed the convent.
- That's the doctor...

606
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:03,846
that came to the convent
three months ago.

607
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:08,411
Okay.

608
01:09:13,723 --> 01:09:16,055
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

609
01:09:21,264 --> 01:09:23,494
Good evening.

610
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,592
- Where is she?
- In the room.

611
01:10:07,043 --> 01:10:08,943
Good.

612
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:20,321
You're a bad man.

613
01:10:30,467 --> 01:10:32,992
They're more powerful
than we expected.

614
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:37,469
Thank you, Aurora.

615
01:10:37,574 --> 01:10:39,474
Thank you so much.

616
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:57,252
- How is she?
- She's fine.

617
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,692
- I have to run some more tests.
- More tests?

618
01:10:59,796 --> 01:11:01,730
- Standard-
- Hey, you just ran your test.

619
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:03,890
- What's wrong with her?
- Expect a call from-

620
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,833
What is wrong with her?

621
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:09,837
Toorop. Toorop.

622
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:12,464
Let him go.

623
01:11:12,575 --> 01:11:14,475
If you please.

624
01:11:16,846 --> 01:11:18,973
Thank you, Sister.

625
01:11:26,222 --> 01:11:28,247
- Get over here!
- What's wrong with you?

626
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:30,849
- I want to know everything that you know.
- Don't you think...

627
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,123
that if I knew anything
I would tell you?

628
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:37,996
No, I don't think. You're a Noelite.
You're like him.

629
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:41,662
- You swore an oath.
- Not to them. To God.

630
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:45,571
God has nothing to do with it now!
You understand?

631
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,768
If she's carrying a virus,
she could annihilate half the city...

632
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:49,606
and I'm not gonna
have it on my conscience!

633
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:53,148
- How can you believe that?
- I don't know what I believe anymore!

634
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,288
I'm pregnant. Twins.

635
01:12:08,398 --> 01:12:12,835
It's not possible.
I've watched over you all your life.

636
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:14,927
No one's ever touched you.

637
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:20,371
And nobody has.

638
01:12:24,447 --> 01:12:26,745
Shit.

639
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,217
Toorop,
theyjust want my babies.

640
01:12:31,254 --> 01:12:34,451
Yes.

641
01:12:34,557 --> 01:12:36,457
Mr. Toorop?

642
01:12:36,559 --> 01:12:40,586
- This is the Noelite Church C.E.O.
- I know who you are.

643
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:45,498
- Thank you for doing such a goodjob, Mr. Toorop.
- You're welcome.

644
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:47,832
Please bring the girl
to the limousine...

645
01:12:47,937 --> 01:12:50,132
and your mission
is accomplished.

646
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,880
We're on our way out.

647
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:05,884
All right, guys. Are you ready?

648
01:13:20,336 --> 01:13:22,804
Keep them in sight, guys.

649
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:30,745
We can't
let her go, Toorop.

650
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:33,680
Look around.
Do we have a choice?

651
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:40,285
She's your problem now.

652
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,785
Thank you, Toorop.

653
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:16,054
We're going in the subway.

654
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:27,328
What's wrong?

655
01:14:27,437 --> 01:14:30,304
It's a missile
linked to my passport.

656
01:14:30,406 --> 01:14:33,000
- How can you stop it?
- Only by death.

657
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:37,311
Go to the subway!

658
01:14:58,101 --> 01:15:00,126
Toorop.

659
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,836
Aurora!

660
01:16:48,244 --> 01:16:49,643
Ow!

661
01:17:05,995 --> 01:17:07,587
I need you to live.

662
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:45,166
He's back to life.

663
01:17:47,236 --> 01:17:50,899
Scars are all gone.
Doctor hasn't lost his touch.

664
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:53,202
Too bad he can't make him pretty.

665
01:17:53,309 --> 01:17:56,938
Where am I?

666
01:17:57,046 --> 01:18:00,072
In paradise. We'll take you to your maker.

667
01:18:22,038 --> 01:18:27,476
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.
I'm Dr. Darquandier, Aurora's father.

668
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,880
Thought you were dead.

669
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:36,418
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

670
01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:38,419
You'll see.

671
01:18:40,089 --> 01:18:43,183
Oh, yes.
You were clinically dead for two hours.

672
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:46,227
I fixed you up as best I could.

673
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:48,729
We lost quite a bit of time
getting you from the morgue.

674
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,392
And then you went
into a coma for five days.

675
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:56,096
Now, Mr. Toorop,
I believe I owe you some explanation.

676
01:18:58,374 --> 01:19:00,968
You see, 20 years ago I was drummed out
of the medical profession...

677
01:19:01,077 --> 01:19:05,741
for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

678
01:19:05,848 --> 01:19:09,807
Around that time, the Noelites
came to me with an unusual offer.

679
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:13,218
They wanted me to do exactly what
the rest of the world was scared of.

680
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:15,620
That is, to create
a supernatural human being...

681
01:19:15,725 --> 01:19:18,785
with the complete knowledge of
the world imprinted in her memory.

682
01:19:18,894 --> 01:19:22,295
So I built a supercomputer...

683
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:25,060
to be Aurora's
artificial mother.

684
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:30,002
As a fetus, Aurora learned
to process information...

685
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:32,904
just like a computer.

686
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:35,443
But when she was born...

687
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,444
she became much more
than just an experiment.

688
01:19:37,546 --> 01:19:39,810
You see, she became-

689
01:19:39,915 --> 01:19:41,815
she became my daughter.

690
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:45,785
She was beautiful. She was unique. And
I couldn't bring myself to give her away.

691
01:19:45,888 --> 01:19:48,413
That's when they hired
Gorsky to kill me.

692
01:19:48,524 --> 01:19:52,051
Well, he almost succeeded.

693
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:55,028
He took my baby away.

694
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:57,793
I searched for her for years.
I couldn't find her.

695
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,801
I knew that one day the Noelites
would have to present their miracle...

696
01:20:00,903 --> 01:20:03,929
to the rest of the world.

697
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:11,970
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

698
01:20:12,081 --> 01:20:15,517
We think she's alive
and that she planned everything.

699
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:17,518
She even shot you
with a purpose.

700
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,181
You see,
you died with your eyes open.

701
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,758
But your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

702
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:28,296
We just need to rewind the tape
and fiddle with your memory.

703
01:20:30,566 --> 01:20:32,466
I was dead.

704
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:35,627
Precisely.

705
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:43,044
People are starving for any kind of miracle.

706
01:20:43,145 --> 01:20:46,979
We were the provider,
and we had the copyright.

707
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:51,543
250 million followers today.
Two billion tomorrow.

708
01:20:51,654 --> 01:20:54,179
This is what Aurora represented.

709
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:56,485
Our stock options were sky high...

710
01:20:56,592 --> 01:20:59,652
and the whole world
was waiting for a revelation.

711
01:20:59,762 --> 01:21:03,357
But not anymore.
Aurora was our trademark.

712
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:08,768
But now our trademark has disappeared
in a ball of fire like a cheap magic trick!

713
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:13,638
And you morons can't even find
a single D.N.A. string to rebuild her.

714
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:17,144
We are finally on the verge
of becoming a bona fide religion...

715
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:21,774
and your incompetence has thrown
20 years of careful planning down the tubes.

716
01:21:21,884 --> 01:21:24,182
Who gave the order
to use guns to retrieve her?

717
01:21:24,286 --> 01:21:27,847
You left Gorsky no choice!
What were you thinking?

718
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:30,517
Try not to get upset, Your Highness.
It's bad for your blood pressure.

719
01:21:30,626 --> 01:21:34,027
Stop fussing. Well?

720
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,792
Does anyone
have any suggestions?

721
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:39,094
What should we do?

722
01:21:41,937 --> 01:21:44,497
Your Highness,
we want to launch a campaign...

723
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:47,542
to inform the people that
we were targets of a terrorist attack.

724
01:21:47,643 --> 01:21:49,543
We need to be proactive,
not victims!

725
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:54,708
In six months, we can offer a closer look
at God through our new space module.

726
01:21:54,817 --> 01:21:57,445
We need a miracle,
not another gadget!

727
01:21:57,553 --> 01:21:59,453
What?

728
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:01,455
The body stolen from the morgue
was Toorop's.

729
01:22:01,557 --> 01:22:04,185
The police found the van
that transported him in New Jersey.

730
01:22:05,694 --> 01:22:09,892
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

731
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:16,437
What am I looking for?

732
01:22:16,539 --> 01:22:19,201
What you missed the first time.

733
01:22:19,308 --> 01:22:21,776
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

734
01:22:22,878 --> 01:22:24,778
Are you ready,
Mr. Toorop?

735
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,780
I hope so.

736
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,398
Fast forward. Fast forward.
Not too fast.

737
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:48,235
Those are his wars.
Don't bring him too far back.

738
01:22:54,043 --> 01:22:56,739
- We're losing control. He's going back too far.
- Kill!

739
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:59,508
That's his childhood. Bring him back.
Don't lead him there.

740
01:23:02,084 --> 01:23:03,984
Bring him forward.

741
01:23:19,268 --> 01:23:21,793
Not on the Noelites. On the bikers. On the bikers.

742
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,472
All right.

743
01:23:30,646 --> 01:23:33,774
He's way past
the danger threshold.

744
01:23:36,418 --> 01:23:38,784
Everyone, slow down.

745
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:41,947
Slow him down now!
Slow down!

746
01:23:47,329 --> 01:23:48,819
Let's wait.
Let's wait. Let's wait!

747
01:24:03,112 --> 01:24:05,637
I need you to live.

748
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,429
He's dead.

749
01:24:26,535 --> 01:24:29,766
Wait.
Don't bring him back yet.

750
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:08,976
Go home.

751
01:25:13,015 --> 01:25:16,348
It's all right. It's all right, Toorop.
You're back. You're safe.

752
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,355
"Go home."
What does it mean?

753
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:28,121
How'd she survive the blast?

754
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:30,460
It's the babies, you see.

755
01:25:30,566 --> 01:25:33,034
They're gaining power.

756
01:25:33,135 --> 01:25:36,127
They're the ones
guiding her.

757
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,834
Her capacity for survival is greater than
anything we could ever have imagined.

758
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:42,570
Survival of the fittest.

759
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:46,645
We're
a pathetic race, really.

760
01:25:46,749 --> 01:25:49,980
We stopped evolving
at a critical point.

761
01:25:50,085 --> 01:25:53,452
Machines have evolved infinitely further
in the past 200 years.

762
01:25:53,555 --> 01:25:55,614
And that's what
I tried to correct with Aurora.

763
01:25:55,724 --> 01:25:57,749
Her babies are our future.

764
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:00,294
They are the real miracle.

765
01:26:01,764 --> 01:26:06,997
You tried to correct mankind
by creating a Virgin Mary.

766
01:26:07,102 --> 01:26:10,265
The Noelites have found us.
They'll be here in two minutes.

767
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,703
Find my daughter.
You're the only one now.

768
01:26:17,312 --> 01:26:21,271
Mr. Gorsky.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see you again.

769
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:23,283
Where is my money?
You still haven't paid me.

770
01:26:23,385 --> 01:26:27,446
- You have an odd way of killing people.
- What are you talking about?

771
01:26:27,556 --> 01:26:30,684
I'm on my way to see our old friend-
Darquandier.

772
01:26:30,793 --> 01:26:33,887
Impossible!
I made his car explode myself.

773
01:26:33,996 --> 01:26:36,965
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill,
I kill for good.

774
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,296
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

775
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:41,392
You need a nuke to kill me!

776
01:26:44,106 --> 01:26:46,506
Bitch.

777
01:26:54,349 --> 01:26:57,614
Our satellites have spotted two vehicles
leaving the compound.

778
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,486
- It's too late to intercept them.
- I'm sick and tired of your damn excuses.

779
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:39,185
Hello, my dear.
It's lovely to see you.

780
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:42,127
- Where's my daughter?
- I see you haven't found her.

781
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:44,529
And you never will.

782
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:46,794
You selfish bastard.

783
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:50,065
Twenty years ago I gave you
the opportunity you wanted.

784
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:52,140
Now it's my moment.

785
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:56,778
- Where is my daughter?
- She's not your daughter.

786
01:27:56,879 --> 01:27:59,404
- She comes from me!
- I designed her!

787
01:27:59,515 --> 01:28:01,483
For me!

788
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:04,950
She's my miracle!
She belongs to my church!

789
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:08,887
Your church is a lie!
You're peddling miracles for your own profit!

790
01:28:17,766 --> 01:28:20,098
Are you willing to die for her?

791
01:28:20,202 --> 01:28:22,102
Yes.

792
01:28:22,204 --> 01:28:24,798
Why?

793
01:28:24,907 --> 01:28:27,808
For a reason
you will never understand.

794
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:32,138
Love?

795
01:28:32,247 --> 01:28:34,147
I understand love.

796
01:28:44,993 --> 01:28:47,291
Find Toorop.
He knows where she is.

797
01:29:22,931 --> 01:29:24,831
Wait here.

798
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,570
Toorop.

799
01:30:29,898 --> 01:30:32,025
You're finally home.

800
01:30:34,236 --> 01:30:36,534
What's left of it.

801
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:41,703
But I came back for you.

802
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,780
Have a little faith.

803
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:04,126
I thought I had saved her.

804
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:10,496
But I was wrong.

805
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,316
Aurora was designed to breed.

806
01:31:27,656 --> 01:31:31,285
The perfect holy virgin
can't live in flesh.

807
01:31:33,462 --> 01:31:36,260
She was just a vessel...

808
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:39,459
a prototype
that wasn't built to last.

809
01:31:43,205 --> 01:31:46,106
She was programmed
to create new life...

810
01:31:47,843 --> 01:31:49,811
and disappear.

811
01:31:57,853 --> 01:32:01,084
They say she won't wake up
before she gives birth.

812
01:32:03,058 --> 01:32:05,720
But I'm here...

813
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:07,727
waiting.

814
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:20,573
Toorop.

815
01:32:35,223 --> 01:32:38,056
Thank you...

816
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,594
for protecting us.

817
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:12,055
You're their father now.

818
01:33:28,944 --> 01:33:31,037
Aurora.

819
01:33:33,081 --> 01:33:37,279
That's the first time
you've said my name.

820
01:34:02,544 --> 01:34:04,774
Save the planet...

821
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,849
one child at a time.

822
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:09,917
Ain't that a bitch.

823
01:34:20,862 --> 01:34:23,456
Take me home to where I'm from

824
01:34:23,565 --> 01:34:26,329
Take me home away from Babylon

825
01:34:26,434 --> 01:34:29,028
Take me back to where I'm from

826
01:34:29,137 --> 01:34:31,537
Take me back away from Babylon

827
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:37,044
Don't be afraid of destiny or paradise

828
01:34:37,145 --> 01:34:42,811
Your path is right above
if you don't compromise

829
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:48,117
These are blessed in space
and, hey, you decide

830
01:34:48,223 --> 01:34:52,523
So real to you but still we realize

831
01:34:52,627 --> 01:34:56,654
Oh, take me home to where I'm from

832
01:34:56,765 --> 01:34:59,393
Seems so far from where I've gone

833
01:34:59,501 --> 01:35:02,026
Take me home to where I'm from

834
01:35:02,137 --> 01:35:04,002
It takes a man to be alone

835
01:35:04,105 --> 01:35:05,572
My mind is the mother ship

836
01:35:05,674 --> 01:35:07,574
I can solve space because of it

837
01:35:07,676 --> 01:35:10,304
The more further I fly
the deeper my subjects get

838
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:13,540
Sun eclipsed, stars align
I see Mars when I rhyme

839
01:35:13,648 --> 01:35:15,639
Knowledge is mine
I got bars to burn

840
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,014
The pen is the tank
The fuel is the ink

841
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:21,088
Souls that think
just like my mind move from the blink

842
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:24,249
Call the pages my runway
The book is my launchpad

843
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:26,987
Soon as the sun blazes
Renaissance on glass

844
01:35:27,095 --> 01:35:29,427
Virgin ears question
all perception

845
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:32,466
The Achozen, resurrectin'
the resurrection

846
01:35:32,567 --> 01:35:35,161
Paradigm shifts
Indirection

847
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,761
Sharp swords slice
the immaculate deception

848
01:35:37,872 --> 01:35:43,242
So fate propels us
through that open door

849
01:35:43,345 --> 01:35:48,908
That heart for show
and so much more room to grow

850
01:35:49,017 --> 01:35:54,319
Human connection illuminates our mission
Mission

851
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:59,189
The past is after death
So never look back

852
01:36:08,436 --> 01:36:10,870
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

853
01:36:10,972 --> 01:36:13,566
Two-two with
the triple fat goose

854
01:36:13,675 --> 01:36:16,439
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

855
01:36:16,544 --> 01:36:19,274
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

856
01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:22,839
Deuces is wild getting
willy off a bag of ily

857
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:25,579
Iced out on the sand
like a chilly willy

858
01:36:25,687 --> 01:36:28,053
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

859
01:36:28,156 --> 01:36:30,522
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

860
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,617
In this world that's been frozen
they come be Achozen

861
01:36:33,728 --> 01:36:36,458
Rising from the dead
Overthrow the opposin'

862
01:36:36,564 --> 01:36:39,294
Forces of evil
controlling our people

863
01:36:39,401 --> 01:36:42,097
Deuces is wild
and their wisdom is lethal

864
01:36:42,203 --> 01:36:45,229
Four twenty-two stomping
through I can see you

865
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,831
Strike a match, light the sun
Watch the preview

866
01:36:47,942 --> 01:36:50,410
Life is a game played once
Don't refuse to

867
01:36:50,512 --> 01:36:53,413
Three is the view
and life we are true to

868
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:55,779
Deuces is wild
It's a triple threat

869
01:36:55,884 --> 01:36:58,580
Two-two with
the triple fat goose

870
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:01,417
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat

871
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:04,754
You, you ain't never
seen a bigger threat
