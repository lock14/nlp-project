1
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,210
The French have said
au revoir to the franc.

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,130
The Germans have said
auf wiedersehen to the Deutschmark.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,090
And the Portuguese have said
whatever to their thing.

4
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:26,855
Go!

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,130
Now it's our turn to say
goodbye to Sterling.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,450
This Christmas
we are going to get the euro.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,250
Goodbye old pound.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,970
Everyone says
we are going to miss you.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,810
- Come on!
- Faster! Faster!

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,530
- Hey come on!
- Faster!

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,690
I can't see ya!
Where are you?

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,610
I'm over here!

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,210
This is the main drag along here.

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,210
That's Portland.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,810
Bisecting that at right angles,
is Lundy on that side.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,690
On this side there's Fastnet.
What's yours?

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,010
Cromarty.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,130
Cromarty and German Bight.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,610
Cul de sacs. Over here.

20
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:10,731
- I've come through.
- Come on! Come on, Damian!

21
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,171
There's a train coming!

22
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,371
Keep pedalling. Come on!

23
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:22,931
Faster!

24
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:27,531
- Beat ya!
- Come on!

25
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,611
I'm gonna call it Serendipity.

26
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,011
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:39,691
- Anyway it's number twenty.
- Upstairs!

28
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:42,771
- This is my room.
- And mine.

29
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,451
Get your own room.

30
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,291
The patron saint of
house removals is Saint Anne.

31
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,771
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that, no.

32
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,371
Yeah, she lived in
the desert, obviously.

33
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:48,011
And when she wanted to move house.

34
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:50,771
Angels came, picked up her house
and took it to Italy.

35
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,132
Handy.

36
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,692
She was Our Lady's mother.

37
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:02,932
What you on about Damian?

38
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,492
Saint Anne. I've got a picture.

39
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,172
Look. I don't care, just get
in the car, will ya? We're going'.

40
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,292
Go on! Get in the car!

41
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,372
- Was she in it at the time?
- Who?

42
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:17,052
Saint Anne.
When the angels did the...

43
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,172
you know the airlift?

44
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,612
I don't know.

45
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,772
Start with the money.

46
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:59,812
That's what our Anthony says.

47
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,092
That's what people
want to know about.

48
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,852
Like if you're moving house...

49
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:07,372
you don't say 'we're moving house
and the new one has got a green door. '

50
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:09,132
You say how much you're paying.

51
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,412
How much you got for the old one.

52
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:16,412
Mortgage. Interest rates.
Stamp duty. Solicitor's fees.

53
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:19,292
How much you'll get
if the new one goes up in value.

54
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:20,732
That's called equity.

55
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,652
Personally, I think, 'so what? '

56
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,092
Money's just a thing.

57
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,452
And things change.

58
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,412
One minute something's there
and you can cuddle up to it.

59
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,212
The next minute it's gone.

60
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,012
Like a Malteser.

61
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,492
That goes in the kitchen.

62
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,692
Is this fantastic or what?

63
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,453
Surprisingly spacious,
with attractive views.

64
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,813
Oh, that's Anthony's.
That must go upstairs and...

65
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,613
And anyway, in the end,

66
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,813
it turns out it wasn't about
the money after all.

67
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:47,973
That's it lads.
Up to the main bedroom.

68
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,973
Has anyone seen
where the phone points are?

69
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,813
Eh, where do I plug this in?

70
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:56,813
Oh, right, yeah.
Oh that looks good, that does.

71
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,459
Right...

72
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,653
this is what
we're having' tonight, yeah?

73
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,453
Before Countdown,
put the oven on.

74
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,533
After Countdown,
get a packet of these,

75
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,813
put them in there
with some oven chips, yeah?

76
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,653
It's for mum.

77
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,056
- The time is on here, yeah.
- Ok.

78
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,413
That's how long
they have to stay in.

79
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,893
By the time they're ready,
I'll be back.

80
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:03,173
She may already have
won ten thousand pounds.

81
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,333
Her name has been entered in a draw.

82
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,453
- All she has to do is...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:09,013
Thank you.

84
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,133
Hands?

85
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,973
Other sides.

86
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,053
Let's go.

87
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,213
Come on!

88
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,413
That's you.

89
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,253
Get your bags.

90
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,534
And your book bag, Damian.
Keyssss...

91
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,054
Now remember
it's no good being clever,

92
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,374
you've got to be
the cleverest, yeah?

93
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,014
- Alright. See ya Dad.
- Good luck lads.

94
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,894
See ya.
Are you nervous?

95
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:39,974
A bit.

96
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,694
So everybody sitting up nicely?
Excellent.

97
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:51,014
Now we are talking, today,
about people we admire.

98
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,614
- Dminic?
- Roy Keane, Sir, Manchester United.

99
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,134
Very good, Roy Keane.
What about you Barry?

100
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,934
- Van Nistelrooy, sir.
- Van Nistelrooy, right.

101
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,694
Anyone got any heroes
who don't play for United?

102
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,894
- Jack?
- Robbie Fowler, Sir, City.

103
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,894
Alright, that's enough.

104
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:06,934
Tricia?

105
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,214
I don't know any footballers, sir.

106
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,574
Well, it doesn't have
to be a footballer,

107
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,494
it could be... anyone.

108
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,054
- Don't know sir.
- No?

109
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:16,414
Damian?

110
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:17,774
Saint Roch, sir.

111
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,254
- Who's he play for?
- No one sir, he's a Saint.

112
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,094
Oh that's better, go on.

113
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,454
He was so worried that
he might say something bad.

114
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:28,014
That he said nothing
at all for twenty years.

115
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:30,454
We could do with a couple
like him in this class.

116
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,294
Thank you, Damian.

117
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,694
I like a lot of virgin martyrs too.

118
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:35,254
Like Saint Agatha.

119
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,574
She ripped her own eyes out,

120
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,894
so she wouldn't have
to marry this man.

121
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:42,094
Or Saint Katherine of Alexandria.

122
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,094
They tried to kill her by crushing
her to death on a wheel.

123
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,014
But she made the wheel explode

124
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,094
and all the splinters
killed people in the crowd.

125
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,574
The patron Saint of fireworks.

126
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:54,414
That's where we get
the Catherine wheel from.

127
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:56,494
I did say thank you, Damian.

128
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,374
Right, I brought in this picture.

129
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,854
This is a hero of mine.
Who knows who this is?

130
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:06,494
- Nelson Mandela?
- Fantastic, Nelson Mandela.

131
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,935
I should be careful
what you talk about.

132
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,215
Try talking about football
or something.

133
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,895
Keep off the weird stuff.

134
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:29,895
Just don't be conspicuous
or you won't fit in.

135
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:01,735
Aero and a Yorkie please.
And five juicy lips.

136
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,295
Haven't seen you two here, before.

137
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,015
We just moved here.

138
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,535
Our mam's dead.

139
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,855
Yeah, well go on, you're alright.

140
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,015
- Thanks.
- God bless.

141
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,744
- Who's next?
- Works every time.

142
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,895
You tell them your mam's dead
and they give you stuff, every time.

143
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,015
I'm your... Community Policeman.

144
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:34,895
Obviously there is
no community here as yet,

145
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,815
not to speak of, but you know...

146
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,175
Anyway the first thing to say is,

147
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:44,495
these new houses
and Christmas coming up.

148
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,495
Statistically
you're going to get burgled.

149
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:51,015
Now, not all of you, but some of you, soon.

150
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,976
Probably this week, next.

151
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:57,456
When you are, call me.

152
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:01,096
I'll give you a crime number

153
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:05,896
and then you can make a claim
on your insurance.

154
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,496
Building maintenance?

155
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,016
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

156
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,816
Yeah, I'm usually right,
it's a knack.

157
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:19,136
Do you mind me asking?
Is the kettle actually on? I'm...

158
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,496
Oh, sorry.

159
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:21,696
Yes?

160
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:24,976
Isn't the problem here,
that our houses are built on sand?

161
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,776
Sand? No.

162
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,216
They're not are they?

163
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,776
If you store up your treasure
on earth it will be stolen.

164
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:35,136
But if you give it away,
then it can't be stolen.

165
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:37,256
Mormons?

166
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,736
Well, Latter Day Saints.

167
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:40,976
Saints?

168
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:41,936
I know all about them...

169
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:42,896
Errr... Damian,

170
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,736
go and give Terry a hand
in the kitchen will you?

171
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,056
You too Anthony,
off you go, good lads.

172
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,176
Now, some of you are
going to be burgled.

173
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,256
There are things I can tell you,

174
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,456
that will lower the odds
of it being you personally.

175
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:56,896
It's a bit anti-social,

176
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,136
because if it isn't
you then it'll be next door,

177
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,056
but ha-ha there you go.

178
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:03,216
Our mam's dead.

179
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,776
Here. Go on, help yourself.

180
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,336
Take as many as you like, son.

181
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:31,136
Result.

182
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,416
Is it completely honest?

183
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,057
Completely dead isn't she?

184
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:15,377
What?

185
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,257
What do you want?

186
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:24,177
Can't you see I'm busy?

187
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:25,537
Just go away.

188
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,297
I don't like having my own room.

189
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:29,698
Clare of Assisi,

190
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:32,498
Eleven Ninety Four till
Twelve Fifty Three?

191
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:33,498
That's right.

192
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:38,698
I used to have a hermitage,
myself, once.

193
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:46,378
I used to go and hide up there.

194
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,618
If anyone needed me,
I'd send them a vision, sort them out.

195
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,138
That's why I'm the patron
saint of television.

196
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:55,218
I was like... human television.

197
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:57,698
You're the patron saint
of television?

198
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:58,778
Keeps me busy.

199
00:13:58,898 --> 00:13:59,818
You know?

200
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:04,818
Are you allowed to smoke then?

201
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,898
You can do what you
like up there, son.

202
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,978
It's down here,
you have to make the effort.

203
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,738
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

204
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,578
She hasn't been there long.

205
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:18,298
Don't ring a bell.

206
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:21,938
Then again,
it is infinite up there.

207
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:26,858
Absolutely bloody infinite.

208
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,458
Listen...

209
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,578
Dad.

210
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:13,619
What is it anyway?

211
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,139
What are you doing
with all these boxes?

212
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,419
- What's that?
- Wait and see.

213
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,539
Where did you get that?

214
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,659
You can see it too then?

215
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,739
Well... you know...

216
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:38,299
sometimes you see things.
Don't you?

217
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,499
And other people can't see them.

218
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:42,899
What?

219
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,539
Well... you know... sometimes,
but this is real though.

220
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,179
This is real. This is real

221
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,579
Can't wait to tell dad.

222
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,619
You can't tell dad about this.

223
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,419
You can't tell anyone about this.

224
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,659
Why not?

225
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:58,899
Tax.

226
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,819
If the government
find out about this,

227
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,099
they'll take forty percent
of it away.

228
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,539
Forty percent!

229
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,259
Do you know how much that is?

230
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,299
Nearly all of it.

231
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,099
Shall we count it before we go?

232
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,099
No, we can't we're really late.

233
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,379
How much? How much?

234
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,482
- There's thousands.
- Ten thousand.

235
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:34,099
- Fifty thousand.
- Seventy.

236
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,259
Two hundred thousand.

237
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,979
Millions even.

238
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,419
Patch... Jenga.

239
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,739
Oink. Oink. Oink. Oink.

240
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:48,379
Promise not to tell anyone.

241
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,619
What is it?

242
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,339
- How much is it?
- Thousands.

243
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,780
Hundreds.

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,380
It's just hundreds.

245
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
No one else knows.

246
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,620
So if anyone finds out,
we'll know it's you. Ok?

247
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,340
Anyone finds out we know it's you.

248
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,060
No one else knows.

249
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,780
Just me and you. Here.

250
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,540
Thanks.

251
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
Yeah, just keep it shut.

252
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,780
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,

253
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,380
five hundred and
twenty pounds, minus...

254
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,900
a hundred quid each,
spending money.

255
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,100
Leaves two hundred
and twenty nine thousand,

256
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,420
three hundred and twenty quid.

257
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,020
And we're going to give
all that to the poor.

258
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,140
Where you going to find poor people?

259
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,980
There's loads of poor people.

260
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,940
Not round here.
The house prices keep them out.

261
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,460
Go on. Go. Go.

262
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,940
Go on. Go. Go. Go on.
Go. Go. Go. Go on.

263
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
Go on.

264
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,980
Francis of Assisi?

265
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,221
Eleven eighty one till
twelve twenty six.

266
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,861
You did this didn't you?

267
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:43,781
My first act as a Saint.

268
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,341
What was your next one?

269
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,181
Washing a leper.

270
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,341
A leper?

271
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,341
You could just help
the poor Damian.

272
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,341
Big Issue. Help the homeless.

273
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,541
Big Issue anyone?

274
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,381
Oh hello.

275
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,741
And keep the change.

276
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:13,701
Oh, thanks mate,
I've had nothing to eat all day.

277
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,021
Oh we're going to Pizza Hut,
want to come.

278
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,461
No... no. She doesn't.
She just wants more money.

279
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,541
- We haven't got any more.
- No I fancy pizza actually.

280
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,181
Can I bring my friend?

281
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:35,661
Meat feast, deep and juicy,
stuffed crust mate.

282
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,101
Two meat feast thin and crispy.

283
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,301
- Ah a big New Yorker.
- A combo platter.

284
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,501
- Do us a farmhouse.
- I'll have some garlic bread love.

285
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:42,941
We'll all have some
garlic bread won't we?

286
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:45,621
And Dippin' Chicken.
To share.

287
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,261
This is great. Anthony thought
there were no poor people round here.

288
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,261
Because of the house prices.

289
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,821
Well they're not from round here.

290
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,021
- Come in on the bus.
- I come in on the train.

291
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,141
Couldn't afford to
live round here.

292
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,861
Who exactly is paying
for all this?

293
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,181
We are.

294
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,581
- You must be minted!
- Yeah we are.

295
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:05,301
No... no, we're not.

296
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,421
It's birthday money.

297
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,181
His birthday money,
he saved it.

298
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:10,941
- Puddings?
- Yes please.

299
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,301
No.

300
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,421
One hundred and sixty eight quid.

301
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,021
Do you know how many times
we'd have to visit Pizza Hut

302
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,301
to get rid of all the money?

303
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,261
One thousand, three hundred and
three point five one seven times.

304
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:21,821
It's just not practical.

305
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:23,421
We should buy property.

306
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:26,222
See this house,
we could buy two like that.

307
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,222
If they knocked some off
the asking price.

308
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,702
And if we did buy property,
that'll go up in value.

309
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:32,622
So we'd have even more money.

310
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,542
Damian?

311
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,342
Excuse me?

312
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,622
Are you poor?

313
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:47,582
Beg your pardon?

314
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,142
Are you poor?

315
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:50,662
Are you asking for money?

316
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,222
Me? No.

317
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,102
Because we don't have any.

318
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:57,382
We live in a community,
you know, it's very basic.

319
00:20:57,502 --> 00:21:00,902
We don't have a dishwasher
for instance or a microwave.

320
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,022
And there's no cash kept
on the premises.

321
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,822
So you are poor?

322
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:07,902
In a sense, yes.

323
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,262
Brilliant!

324
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:22,582
Invergi. Invergi

325
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,662
St. Nicholas of Myra?

326
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,982
Sanctus quartus saeculus sum...

327
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:32,182
Patronus de nautae et,
vero, natalis.

328
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:35,702
It won't all fit.

329
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:39,062
El fini errant centi cetus poplas

330
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:48,222
Saint Nicholas?

331
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,702
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

332
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:53,782
- Ques?
- Saint Maureen. She's new.

333
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:55,102
Quat facki abat?

334
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:58,742
Skin care. She worked on
the make-up counter at Selfridges.

335
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,302
Sel-frid-ges?

336
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,942
To betal?

337
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,182
Est a quero publican rodeo.

338
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,743
It's less than a fortnight to E-day.

339
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,583
That's when
Britain completes transition

340
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,583
to the European Monitory Union.
The EMU.

341
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:23,284
Oh, with twelve
days left to E-day,

342
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,054
my true love said to me...

343
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:31,263
The transitional exchange rate
is fixed at sixty seven p.

344
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,783
Oh! Well all I can say is...
ding dong

345
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,783
After E-day your old money
will no longer be legal tender.

346
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:42,383
Wish pounds goodbye and euros...

347
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:44,103
Hello.

348
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:46,943
We don't have to queue up.

349
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:51,343
Here we go.

350
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:55,664
How much have you actually got?

351
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:56,824
Plenty.

352
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,704
- Anthony Cunningham.
- Where's your dad?

353
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,624
My dad? Well he's not coming.

354
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:09,664
Eh?

355
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,864
Yeah, he's not coming yet.
He said to start without him.

356
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:13,384
Start what without him?

357
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:14,944
The job is to show him
around the apartment.

358
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:17,144
How can I do that,
if he isn't here?

359
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:18,464
He gave me this.

360
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:21,624
Show me around and
I'll fill him in afterwards.

361
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,544
It's what we usually do.

362
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:29,024
We're looking at this for our
investment portfolio.

363
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,584
Not as a residence.

364
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,024
Has it kept it's value?

365
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:34,104
It's gone up twenty percent
in the last two years,

366
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,664
because of the schools.

367
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,384
He does send you to school doesn't he?

368
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:39,584
Or do you just
look at photos of them?

369
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,024
Flood lights. Scoreboards. Stadium.

370
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:49,144
It's the dogs bollocks this,
family heirloom. Fifty quid?

371
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,304
Fifty quid?

372
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:52,344
You could buy
a proper football team for that.

373
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:54,344
I could buy Crewe Alexander for that.

374
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:57,904
Yeah but...
this has got managers.

375
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:00,024
Dan Leavy and Malcolm Allinson

376
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,624
Never heard of him.

377
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:02,784
Deal.

378
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,784
You said you would for five quid.

379
00:25:07,904 --> 00:25:09,904
I didn't know you were going
to get five quid did I?

380
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,544
Ten quid then?

381
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:13,624
Look, I've got a good body.

382
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:17,144
Twenty quid, last offer.

383
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:38,464
Martyrs of Uganda,
eighteen eighty one?

384
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:39,825
That's right.

385
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,545
Ohhhh sorry about that.

386
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:47,225
I was beheaded. See.

387
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,545
Before that I was in construction.

388
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:54,185
I don't know who built this,
but they were a right cowboy.

389
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:56,105
I built it myself.

390
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:58,905
Well, you'll see what we can do.

391
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,505
But I can't promise anything.

392
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:02,425
Why not?
There's plenty of you.

393
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:05,905
Yes, come on welcome.

394
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,905
Hello.

395
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:23,545
What are they singing?

396
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,145
They are praying for rain.

397
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,025
Where I come from...

398
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,785
people have to pay a tenth
of their daily income on water.

399
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:41,465
It's so expensive that they can't
afford to wash their hands.

400
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,385
So they get disease.

401
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:47,905
You don't need fancy hospitals
or medicines to make life better,

402
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,505
just a well.
And you...

403
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:54,025
can build a well for as
little as one hundred pounds.

404
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,905
That's fantastic!
Thanks.

405
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,785
I'm sorry I don't know who you are.

406
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:15,705
Mutual that then.

407
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:19,065
This yours?

408
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,265
Nice.

409
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:26,146
Near a railway.

410
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,906
- What's in there?
- Nothing really.

411
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:51,026
- What's this?
- A dress. It was my mums.

412
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:03,066
What are you looking for?

413
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:08,546
Money.

414
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:11,146
Are you poor?

415
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:12,986
What?

416
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:14,506
Damian, come in.

417
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,568
- Anthony to Damian...
- What's that?

418
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:18,266
- Damian, where are you?
- My brother I've got to go.

419
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:21,026
I'll come back. I've got loads.
Just wait there.

420
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:24,586
- Loads of what?
- Money. Just wait there.

421
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:28,306
Five... four...
three... two...

422
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:30,786
Who's that?

423
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:33,306
A poor person and
you said there weren't any.

424
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:35,106
I know. But who is it?

425
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:37,626
I don't know. Just someone.

426
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,546
What do you mean 'someone'?

427
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,266
Did he do anything to you?

428
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,906
- What sort of things?
- Never mind.

429
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:48,466
Look people are weird.
You've got to be more careful.

430
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,186
You shouldn't really talk to them.

431
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,626
Anyway I've told him now.

432
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,786
- Told him what?
- That we have tons of money.

433
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:56,506
He's poor.

434
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:58,826
What?

435
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:05,986
Nothing. Nothing.
Leave it to me.

436
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:15,387
Where is he then?

437
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,107
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago.

438
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,627
See.

439
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:35,827
Loads of money.
We've been saving it up for ages.

440
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:38,987
You can have it if you need it.

441
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,427
Come on Damian.

442
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,507
You'll have to change it quickly.

443
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,307
Do you think that was really enough?

444
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:58,667
More than enough.

445
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,467
That's him completely sorted out.

446
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:04,867
Right. Have you given money
to anyone else?

447
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,227
Not really.

448
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,067
What?

449
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:34,827
It wasn't that much.

450
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:36,507
Just like a bagful.

451
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:44,027
- What's that?
- Scuba scooter.

452
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,787
It goes at ten mile an hour
for up to five hours.

453
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:49,867
We could have one of them.
We could have one each.

454
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:51,987
We could have a whole fleet.

455
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:53,907
She's nice.

456
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:56,388
Huh! I've seen better.
Close the door.

457
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:07,748
Look you can see it protruding.

458
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:10,268
- What is it?
- It's a nipple.

459
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:11,708
What's it for?

460
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:15,268
Well it's for feeding babies.

461
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:17,588
Did mum have one?

462
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,508
Two. They've all got two.

463
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,308
And did she feed us with them?

464
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:23,548
Yeah, course she did. I remember.

465
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,108
You can't remember
when you were a baby.

466
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:29,668
I don't remember her doing it to me.
I remember her doing it to you.

467
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:33,228
Anthony?

468
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:38,708
What?

469
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:39,908
I thought you'd done the washing up?

470
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:41,148
I did it!

471
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,788
What do you call that glob?

472
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:03,828
Hello what's your name?

473
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:05,068
Keegan.

474
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:07,868
Alright, K, what's happened
to your finger?

475
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,708
That's quality.
Pure scary, pure scary.

476
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:15,508
Hey, give me your money.
Come on, empty your pockets.

477
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:18,668
Hey you! Excuse me, excuse me!

478
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:21,548
Give me all your money.
Come on, every copper.

479
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,188
Who feels sorry
for poor children?

480
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,108
Correct answer.

481
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,508
Everybody sitting up nicely?

482
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,668
Ok. So, as you know,

483
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,868
we're going to have
new money in the New Year.

484
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:42,469
Does anybody know how much
a euro is worth in pounds?

485
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:44,189
Yes.

486
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,149
- Sixty seven p.
- Spot on.

487
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,789
Here, there's
a little prize for you.

488
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,589
It's your own euro converter.

489
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,909
Now! Who else wants one?
Anybody?

490
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:55,309
- Me!
- Ohh. Everybody. Ok.

491
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,829
So, who can tell me how much
two pence is worth in euros?

492
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:04,829
Mmm. Well I'll tell you.

493
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:09,309
It's worth not very much.
Almost nothing.

494
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:10,749
To you.

495
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:13,549
But if we all put our
two pences together.

496
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,709
Then we'll have a lot
of two pences won't we?

497
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,149
Yes.

498
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:18,989
How many people are there here?

499
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,869
One... two... three... four...

500
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,549
Five... six... seven... eight...

501
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:29,349
Two hundred and fifty.

502
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:32,415
- Sorry? - There's two hundred
and fifty in the school.

503
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,149
Oh clever clogs head master.

504
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,589
Ok two hundred and fifty.

505
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:41,069
So if you each gave me two pence,
then I'd have five pounds.

506
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,629
It's not that much here.

507
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:46,629
But in Ethiopia five pounds
could feed a family for a week.

508
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,349
And if you all gave me two two pences,
then we'd have a tenner.

509
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,269
And that's enough
to provide that village

510
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:55,069
with a source
of clean water forever.

511
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:58,109
It's no good to you.
So chuck it in the bin.

512
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,949
Excuse me.
Give me all your money!

513
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,709
Come on, every copper.

514
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:07,829
Get out of my way. Hey you!

515
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,949
Hey, give me your money!

516
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:12,029
Come on. Empty your pockets.

517
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,709
Hello, what's your name?

518
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:18,669
Damian.

519
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,549
Hi Damian. I'm the Bin.

520
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,789
Hello Bin.

521
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,509
Damian, you'll give me
some money won't you?

522
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,750
Yeah.

523
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,950
What did you do?

524
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,190
You did it again didn't you?

525
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,350
What?

526
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,910
I saw what you did.

527
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,830
How much?

528
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,230
Not much. She's nice.

529
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,350
I've been thinking.

530
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,910
Why don't we give the money to her?

531
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,270
So how did it go?

532
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,390
Well...

533
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,470
A thousand!

534
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,150
What did you bring
a thousand to school for?

535
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,590
Can't you see
that that's suspicious?

536
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,070
It's not suspicious.
It's unusual.

537
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,310
How can it be suspicious?
It's our money.

538
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,510
Right you lot outside...
come on.

539
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,030
Right, that's enough
messing around.

540
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,110
Do you know in Africa

541
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,070
you can build a well for
as little as a hundred pounds.

542
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,430
Just listen.

543
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,270
It was the most daring,
most brilliant,

544
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,830
cleverest and biggest robbery
on record, ever.

545
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,350
The train was here.

546
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,870
The train,
the one with the money,

547
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,110
Used notes.

548
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,750
Right the van comes up
onto the platform... here.

549
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,590
It's a railway van
so no one takes any notice.

550
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,510
Until...

551
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,190
They jump out of this van

552
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,030
and some of them got hold
of the driver.

553
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,950
Some of them start shifting the money.

554
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,791
By this time rapid response
has been mobilised.

555
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:18,431
Alright, let's go. Come on!

556
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:34,831
The van drives off with
a reckless disregard for life.

557
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,751
Rapid response goes after it.

558
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:39,831
There's... armed units.
Dog handlers. Helicopters.

559
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:41,551
Throw everything at them.

560
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,471
The train stays here.

561
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,831
An ambulance comes,
takes the driver to hospital.

562
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,271
Get another driver.

563
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,911
The CID count the bags.
There's only one missing.

564
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:54,431
Then rapid response corner the van.

565
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,536
Trapped.

566
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,791
The robbers dropped
the lot and they leg it!

567
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:09,071
They've got no chance, except...

568
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:13,111
Newcastle United versusArsenal
at Highbury.

569
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,751
One all. Disappointing result
for the gunners.

570
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,711
Please advise car,
I think we've lost them.

571
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,111
They don't catch the men.

572
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:25,391
But that's alright
because when they get back to the van...

573
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:28,471
there's the missing bag.

574
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,391
How do you...
how do you know all that?

575
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:32,071
His uncle works for the police.

576
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:33,311
The van has gone.

577
00:37:33,471 --> 00:37:34,951
The train is in the station.

578
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:37,631
And the cops are
in the cop shop making tea.

579
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,391
Where are the robbers?

580
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:43,791
Where's the last place
you're going to look?

581
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:46,191
- Our house?
- Maybe.

582
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:50,111
So the train moves off
with a new driver and all the money.

583
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:51,391
On the train.

584
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,871
The money was on the train
and so was a robber?

585
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:55,512
Lateral thinking.

586
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:02,312
The money stays on the train,
but so does a robber.

587
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:23,032
He sits tight.

588
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:25,512
And every time the train
comes to a slow bend

589
00:38:25,672 --> 00:38:27,552
he chucks a sack of money out.

590
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,432
They've got people waiting
all over the country.

591
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,832
Could be Stafford or Crewe.

592
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,312
Could be Preston or Wigan.

593
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:36,992
Runcorn, it could be.

594
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,032
Could be here.

595
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:12,472
Damian.

596
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:15,872
Damian. Calm down.
It'll be alright.

597
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:17,112
No one knows it was us.

598
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,472
I don't care. Leave me alone.
What you have to tell me for?

599
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,952
Because I wanted you to know
the truth.

600
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,792
We have to give it back.

601
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:27,192
No... no we can't do that.

602
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,512
They were going to burn it.

603
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:31,992
Now come on, it isn't the money's
fault it got stolen.

604
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:35,352
- I thought it was from God.
- What?

605
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:38,032
Well you know sometimes
you tell people about mam

606
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,192
and they give you money
or sweets.

607
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:41,753
Well I told God and...

608
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:44,353
well who else would have
that kind of money?

609
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,433
Well... in a funny...

610
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:50,673
God doesn't rob banks, alright.
God does not rob banks.

611
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,633
Office. Now.

612
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:01,233
Your father's on his way.

613
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,153
Come in.

614
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,713
The Mormons!

615
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:19,233
You stole money from mormons?

616
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:22,513
Would you like to tell
us why you did it Anthony?

617
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,433
Our mam's dead.

618
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:43,313
Hey. Hey. Hey Anthony come here.
Anthony, Damian, come here.

619
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:49,073
Ok. Team talk.

620
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:52,713
Your mother,

621
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:55,993
She would not want you,

622
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:59,513
to stand around crying
or to steal things.

623
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:03,953
She wants you to get on
with your lives

624
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:05,513
and do the best you can.

625
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,393
Make her proud, son, eh?

626
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:12,593
And not, you know... cry.

627
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:18,993
Ok. So let's stop crying eh?

628
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:21,033
And stealing things.
Let's stop that too.

629
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:22,273
Get in the car.

630
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,754
Don't ever do that to me again.

631
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:34,274
Look. I'm really sorry
it was me.

632
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:37,314
I didn't mean to cause
any trouble or anything.

633
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:40,514
No you did right.
They stole it, what could you do?

634
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:43,474
They did give it to a good cause.

635
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:45,594
I wouldn't have done
that at their age.

636
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:49,314
They must be...
you did a good job.

637
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,074
Thanks.

638
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:58,114
Are you from the social?

639
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,514
No. I'm just a visitor.

640
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:02,914
I go round the schools
collecting for this water thing.

641
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:05,234
And try and tell them about
the change over, you know.

642
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:07,074
Making sure that
the kids understand it.

643
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,794
Does anyone understand it?

644
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:11,274
Sometimes they are a bit confused,
until I talk to them.

645
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:12,514
And then...

646
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:14,554
They're really confused.

647
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,314
I'm sorry.
They're very sorry.

648
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:22,754
I've sent them to bed.

649
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:25,074
I want you to know that
it won't happen again.

650
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:27,554
Do you mind me asking
how you came to have

651
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,394
so much cash in the house?

652
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:33,154
It was a donation.
It was left here anonymously.

653
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,434
And you weren't suspicious
about that?

654
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,034
No, we pray a lot and

655
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,954
we thought it was
the answers to our prayers.

656
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:42,554
Only it has been mentioned
that you spent close

657
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:44,554
to five thousand pounds in Comet...

658
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:46,114
A few days ago.

659
00:42:47,194 --> 00:42:51,354
Digital television.
Mircowave oven.

660
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:56,234
Dishwasher. Foot spa.

661
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,474
Did you actually pray for
all of these things?

662
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:05,274
We were praying for comfort
and encouragement.

663
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:08,154
I think we felt comforted
and encouraged.

664
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:09,674
By the foot spa?

665
00:43:10,394 --> 00:43:11,795
And the dishwasher.

666
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:19,075
Samaritans. Oxfam.

667
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:20,915
Christian Aid.

668
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:23,475
For Christ's sake,
don't tick them little boxes.

669
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:26,835
The ones about putting you in touch
with like- minded organisations.

670
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:28,875
You'll be besieged man.
I'm telling you!

671
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:31,435
Saint Peter, died AD sixty four.

672
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:33,355
Alright, don't remind us.

673
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:35,475
The money... it's robbed.

674
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:36,835
I know.

675
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:41,155
Patron Saint of keys,
locks and general security, man.

676
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:44,515
Including up there.
I'm on the door.

677
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:47,755
Is it still alright,
if it's robbed?

678
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:52,275
Can you still do good with it
or should you give it back?

679
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:55,595
I thought it was a miracle,
but it is just robbed.

680
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:57,635
Damian. Listen.

681
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:02,715
One day I was
with you know who, Jesus.

682
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:07,595
And he went up into the mountains
and thousands of people followed him.

683
00:44:07,755 --> 00:44:10,875
The police said five thousand,
five thousand.

684
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,075
Everybody knows this story.

685
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:14,155
Loaves and fishes.

686
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:17,475
See, I knew you'd say that.
That's what everybody says.

687
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:23,075
This yours?

688
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:25,555
It's the key to the old house.

689
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:29,835
Jointed pin tumbler
Engineering perfection.

690
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:35,115
Anyway, this kid comes up to us,
about your size,

691
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:37,435
His name was...
no I have forgotten.

692
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:39,235
I still see him sometimes.

693
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,515
Anyway he comes up
with these loaves and fishes.

694
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,035
Sardines.

695
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:47,595
And Jesus blesses them
and passes the plate round.

696
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:51,155
Now the first person
he passes it to, passes it on.

697
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:52,395
He doesn't take anything.

698
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:55,835
He just passes it on.
Do you know why?

699
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,076
Because he had a piece
of lamb hidden in his pocket.

700
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,916
And as he is passing the fish,
he sneaks a bit of meat out

701
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,836
and pretends he's taken
it off the plate.

702
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:06,676
Do you see what I'm saying?

703
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:10,516
And the next person
exactly the same story.

704
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:13,796
Every single bastard one
of them has their own food.

705
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,276
And every one of them
is keeping it quiet.

706
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:18,196
Looking after number one.

707
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:22,716
But as that plate went round
with the sardines on

708
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:26,636
They all got their own food
out and started to share.

709
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:29,796
And then that plate went
all the way round

710
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:30,876
And back to Jesus

711
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:33,156
and it'd still got the fish
and the loaves on it.

712
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:36,796
I think Jesus was a bit taken aback.

713
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,956
He says, 'what happened? '

714
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:42,356
And I just said 'miracle'.

715
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:45,236
And at first
I thought I'd fooled him.

716
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:51,756
But now I see it was a miracle,
one of his best.

717
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:55,516
But this little kid
had stood up and...

718
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,756
Everybody there just got bigger.

719
00:46:02,556 --> 00:46:04,876
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

720
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:06,236
Not really.

721
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:10,156
I'm talking about you.

722
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:11,796
Now I'm really lost.

723
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,916
You're trying too hard.

724
00:46:14,516 --> 00:46:17,836
That kid he wasn't planning
on doing a miracle.

725
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:20,516
He wasn't planning anything,
except lunch.

726
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:24,476
Something that looks like a miracle
turns out to be dead simple.

727
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:27,716
But what am I going to do
with all this?

728
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:31,476
I just want to be good.

729
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,196
Look I can't say too
much about this,

730
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:37,476
because of that whole
free will thing.

731
00:46:37,636 --> 00:46:38,756
Right?

732
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:40,356
But...

733
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:47,677
see this key?
Keep it safe. Alright?

734
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:54,277
And I'll have a word upstairs...

735
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:58,797
See if I can get somebody
on your case more permanent.

736
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:06,117
It's three days left to e-day,
my true love said to me.

737
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,517
Convert your change
or donate to charity.

738
00:47:09,677 --> 00:47:12,317
Huummmmm, marvellous.

739
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:14,397
There are just three days
left to e-day.

740
00:47:14,557 --> 00:47:17,957
Remember the money in your bank account
has already been converted.

741
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:20,077
The easiest way to change
any cash you have

742
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,797
is to pay it into your account.

743
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:24,597
The Sterling becomes Euros
the moment it's paid in.

744
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,557
And if you don't have an account,
why not open one today?

745
00:47:27,717 --> 00:47:28,837
Can I help you at all?

746
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:30,277
We'd like to open a bank account.

747
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:32,197
- Is your mum and dad with you?
- No.

748
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:35,237
Well I need an adult signature.
I need proof of who you are.

749
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:38,317
Oh we thought of that.
Leisure pass.

750
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,517
I'm afraid you're going to have
to ask your mum to come in.

751
00:47:42,637 --> 00:47:44,837
This isn't enough.
Just ask your mum to come in.

752
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:46,837
- We can't.
- Why not?

753
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:49,917
Our mam's dead.

754
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,237
There's two free euros in here

755
00:48:02,157 --> 00:48:04,397
And you can keep the rest
of your money in it.

756
00:48:05,037 --> 00:48:06,517
It's the best I can do.

757
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:13,997
I told you.
We should have bought a house.

758
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:18,117
Right if we can't hide it,
at least we can spend it.

759
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,957
- Hello.
- Now that is quality.

760
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:29,038
That is amazing.
I can see you. Can you see me?

761
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,278
Yeah.

762
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:32,118
Not here, on there.

763
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:33,198
Not as well.

764
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,238
I can see you in mine.
This is fantastic.

765
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:37,118
Anthony.

766
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:39,318
Why don't we give the money
to the lady with the bin?

767
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:42,198
It's not ours and
we're never going to spend it all.

768
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:43,518
She could do good with it.

769
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:46,478
We just gave her a grand and
look at the trouble it caused.

770
00:48:46,638 --> 00:48:49,758
And if we gave her two hundred
we'll end up in jail.

771
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:53,198
We're on our own now Damian.
Don't let me down.

772
00:49:05,438 --> 00:49:08,278
Hello.
The speaker went on the bin.

773
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:10,598
Your dad said he'd fix it.
So I said I'd cook for him.

774
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:12,798
So you get a decent meal for once.

775
00:49:13,598 --> 00:49:17,158
I'm a fantastic cook.
Aren't I a fantastic cook, Damian?

776
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:19,478
The size of that school bag.

777
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:21,398
You'll give yourselvesa hernia,
is that all homework?

778
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,638
- No.
- Yeah.

779
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:27,718
Er, costumes for the nativity play.
I suppose it is homework really.

780
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:30,118
I love a nativity play,
can I see them?

781
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:31,478
- Yeah.
- No.

782
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:35,998
It's private. Private property...
of the school.

783
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:37,118
It will spoil the surprise.

784
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:38,598
Am I going to go too?

785
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,598
Are you going to get
me some tickets?

786
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:42,238
Well I suppose so.

787
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:43,758
Well I didn't even know
they were in it.

788
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:46,158
I get told nothing
you know, nothing.

789
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,318
Are you going to come
and do some chopping?

790
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:51,598
It's lasagne, your favourite.

791
00:49:55,878 --> 00:49:58,238
Where was the highwaymanan,
Dick Turpin,

792
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:00,438
hanged in seventeen thirty nine?

793
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:03,238
- York.
- How did you know that?

794
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:05,518
- It's York.
- Glasgow... Carlisle...

795
00:50:05,678 --> 00:50:06,758
He knows everything your dad.

796
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:08,398
- Norwich... York...
- Why don't you go on it,

797
00:50:08,558 --> 00:50:10,598
you'd be great,
wouldn't he, he'd be great.

798
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,558
Fifty fifty please.

799
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,319
It's York!

800
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:15,799
You'd be a lot less frustrated
if you went on yourself.

801
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:17,319
Damian, tell him to go on.

802
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:19,239
You'd like to have a million
pounds wouldn't you?

803
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,759
It's not a million pounds.
It's a million euros.

804
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,519
That's only about...

805
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,199
Six hundred and
twenty three thousand,

806
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,879
one hundred pounds
at today's prices.

807
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,799
At least somebody
has been listening.

808
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:33,999
Told you it was York.

809
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,279
Jim, I'm so sorry
the answer is York.

810
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,439
We're supposed to go to bed
when this is finished.

811
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:43,799
Yeah right, go to bed.

812
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:47,159
But you're supposed
to read us a story.

813
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:50,959
- I'll get off.
- I'll see you out.

814
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,679
I'll see you out too.

815
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:56,799
I know.

816
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:04,319
Come again soon.

817
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:06,999
- Sucker for women.
- Sucker for men.

818
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:13,159
Don't forget I want to seethat
nativity play. Your dad'llforget.

819
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,679
Go and get your pyjamas on.

820
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,399
They're good lads.

821
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,199
Nice to have someone to talk
to once in a while, though.

822
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:23,879
Yeah. Thanks.
I had a great evening.

823
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,959
I know what she's after.

824
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,399
We can't leave it here.

825
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,999
We're going to have tokeep
it with us...

826
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,079
all the time.

827
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,519
Fill your school bag.

828
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,759
And don't let it out your sight.

829
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:38,079
Guard it with your life,
whatever happens.

830
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,879
- Ok?
- Ok.

831
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,039
Damian?

832
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,199
Have you any room?

833
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:46,719
- Have youany room?
- No, Damian,

834
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,719
Damian he's tired, he's walked
here all the way from Nazareth.

835
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,959
He's tired.
He's very, very tired.

836
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:54,919
- Well...
- Tired.

837
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,720
The walk fromNazareth,
people did that all the time.

838
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,800
And he was a carpenter.
So he was very fit.

839
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,000
He wasn't tired.
He was excited.

840
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,920
His wife was going to have a baby.

841
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,160
They weren't expecting
to go to sleep.

842
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,440
Ok. You say excited.
I say tired. Let's try nervous?

843
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,640
Ok? Shall we start again?

844
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,600
Joseph the Worker,
first century, dates uncertain?

845
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,320
I wouldn't have said nervous.
I would have said focused.

846
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,280
Well, have you any room?

847
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,280
What did he want to bring her for?

848
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,840
You invited her.

849
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,480
Beginners.
Beginners positions.

850
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,720
Damian, come on.

851
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,600
The word went out
from Julius Caesar.

852
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,840
Caesar...

853
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,200
Caesar Augustus that everybody

854
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,200
had to go to their
home town to be taxed.

855
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,680
So Mary and Joseph
set out for Bethlehem.

856
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,800
# Little Donkey,
# Little Don. Key.

857
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,681
# On the dusty road...

858
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:46,881
Do you know how much
a piece of gold that big

859
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:48,961
would be worth at today's prices?

860
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:52,041
A lot. An awful lot.
I wonder what happened to it?

861
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:54,921
Because he was poor after that.
I wonder what he spent it on.

862
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,281
Can we please loose
the anachronistic bag?

863
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:01,161
I don't think they had Addidas
in the first century.

864
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:05,161
Far away to the East,
three wise men saw a star.

865
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:06,721
Thanks girls.

866
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:08,241
Look a star!

867
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,481
Let's follow it.

868
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:16,041
# Come, they told me,
# par um pa pa pa pum

869
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:22,241
# A new born King to see,
# par um pa pum pum

870
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:32,241
No, Saint Maureen.

871
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:36,921
I don't think I have heard of her.
Is she a virgin martyr?

872
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,441
I don't think so.

873
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,361
Here he is.

874
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,561
He's always got
those bags with him.

875
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:49,401
Pom pom pom...

876
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:53,161
Do you remember me?

877
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,241
Mmmm...?

878
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,961
I'm the poor man.

879
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:03,321
Damian Cunningham,
what are you doing there?

880
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:05,041
Come on, where should you be?

881
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,761
Where should you be,
you should be in Bethlehem,

882
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:07,721
come on.

883
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:10,201
I can't believe you've got...
no go back... go back.

884
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:11,921
As for these.

885
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:13,841
What have I told you about these?

886
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:15,481
I've told you before. Ssshhhhh.

887
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,481
Back out! Back out! Back out!

888
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:19,321
Shhhhh! Back on! Back on!

889
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,721
They tried first at one inn.

890
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:24,601
Do you have any room
at this inn?

891
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,801
No sorry, we're fully booked.

892
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:29,002
Do you have any room
at this inn?

893
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,522
We haven't any room,
but we've got a stable.

894
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:39,842
So he took them to the stable...

895
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:43,082
Oh, this is nice and cosy,
Joseph...

896
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,602
and cosy Joseph...

897
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:54,802
I said this is nice
and cosy Joseph.

898
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:57,122
Damian? Damian?

899
00:55:59,562 --> 00:56:03,922
Yes, this is where our
Lord Baby Jesus will be born.

900
00:56:05,682 --> 00:56:09,682
And so our Saviour came,
bringing peace to all the earth.

901
00:56:10,002 --> 00:56:14,442
# Silent night, Holy night...

902
00:56:14,602 --> 00:56:15,802
Quick, come on!

903
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,643
You stay there.

904
00:58:43,363 --> 00:58:45,163
Oh no the keys!

905
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:38,924
Oh no!

906
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:53,244
Damian!

907
00:59:53,364 --> 00:59:54,444
- What you doing?
- Dad!

908
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,004
Come here!
Oh God!

909
00:59:56,124 --> 00:59:58,284
Come here! Come here!
It's alright.

910
00:59:58,444 --> 01:00:00,684
Let's get you down.
What were you doing?

911
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:02,044
- Is he all right, Dad?
- There we go,

912
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:03,284
- What's he doing?
- Good lad.

913
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:13,284
Well he found it!

914
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:16,924
Ltjust fell out of the sky.
Right in front of me.

915
01:00:17,044 --> 01:00:18,924
I thought it was from God.

916
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:22,004
From God?

917
01:00:23,004 --> 01:00:25,844
It's not really his thing is it,
handing out cash?

918
01:00:26,604 --> 01:00:28,524
Why would God hand out...

919
01:00:29,804 --> 01:00:33,404
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,
three hundred and twenty pounds.

920
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:38,884
Blimey!

921
01:00:39,004 --> 01:00:43,005
I was going to give it to the poor,
but it was really hard.

922
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:46,445
Why didn't you tell me?

923
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,805
Anthony said not to,
because of the tax.

924
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:54,445
We could keep some of it though
couldn't we, like a reward?

925
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,365
- Get in.
- Oh!

926
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,285
So what are we going
to do with it then?

927
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,485
We're going to hand it in.
All of it.

928
01:01:01,645 --> 01:01:04,285
Well what else can we do?
It's not ours is it?

929
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:45,245
Hello?

930
01:01:46,045 --> 01:01:48,805
I called round, the door was open.
I've called the police.

931
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:51,405
I thought you might have come home.

932
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:09,965
Everyone gets burgled at
Christmas, Dad.

933
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:13,445
This will be your crime number.

934
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:17,765
So you can get on to your
insurance company.

935
01:02:18,085 --> 01:02:19,965
Of course they can't really
recompense you for this.

936
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:22,645
I mean they can't give you
your Christmas back can they?

937
01:02:22,765 --> 01:02:25,645
Probably be next Christmas by
the time you get anything back.

938
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:32,726
I don't suppose you've got any
serial numbers, security codes,

939
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:35,006
anything like that? No?

940
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:37,606
Well, wouldn't make any difference.

941
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:41,806
It's very rare we get anything back.
Very rare.

942
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,766
Whe know the stolen currency
is around here somewhere.

943
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:49,206
That's what this is all about.

944
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:50,926
But they can't do anything about it.

945
01:02:51,086 --> 01:02:52,966
All the banks have been
warned to look out

946
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:55,726
for anyone making
any large deposits.

947
01:02:56,446 --> 01:02:59,086
And of course,
it's only one day or two,

948
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:02,446
before they realise
that the money is worthless.

949
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:37,846
What's that?

950
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:40,526
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It's just my stuff.

951
01:03:41,806 --> 01:03:43,406
Oh dad, don't.

952
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,606
Oh my God!

953
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:53,166
This is what they were after.

954
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:57,886
That's a lot of money.
Where did it come from?

955
01:03:58,006 --> 01:04:00,846
They took our Christmas.
We'll take their cash.

956
01:04:01,006 --> 01:04:03,566
- You can't keep it.
- You're going to keep it?

957
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:05,006
It belongs to the government.

958
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:06,246
They were going to burn it.

959
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:07,566
They were going to burn
all this money,

960
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:09,126
that's a crime if you ask me.

961
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:11,206
- Definitely.
- But stealing is wrong.

962
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:13,607
If you steal something,
you have to steal it from somebody.

963
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:14,927
Who would we be stealing it from?

964
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:16,287
It's not right!

965
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:18,967
Damian, my house has
just been ransacked.

966
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:21,087
I work every second God sends
just to cover the mortgage,

967
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:22,727
to give you a decent home.

968
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:25,767
And now it's been wrecked.

969
01:04:26,687 --> 01:04:28,167
I am owed this.

970
01:04:29,287 --> 01:04:30,687
- But Da...
- Go to bed.

971
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:32,687
Now!

972
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:04,927
- Do you want a story?
- It's wrong.

973
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,807
- Who says?
- God.

974
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:10,007
Yeah, well.

975
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:13,807
Yeah, well what?

976
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:17,967
- Don't you want to go to heaven?
- Look around you, Damian.

977
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:19,887
We're on our own.

978
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:22,567
No one is smiling
down on us Damian.

979
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,287
No one is is looking out for us.

980
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:26,687
So we're looking out
for ourselves.

981
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:28,607
- But mam...
- Is dead.

982
01:05:31,607 --> 01:05:33,207
She's dead, Damian.

983
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:38,487
You'll never see her again.
And neither will I.

984
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:46,447
And the money, is ours.

985
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:49,807
We'll take it to town tomorrow
and change it and spend it,

986
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,247
do you hear me?

987
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:54,487
All of it, because it's ours.

988
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:29,408
I know you've got it.
It's mine.

989
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:33,448
And you're going to change
it tomorrow.

990
01:06:34,808 --> 01:06:39,568
And that's a good thing. Ok?

991
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:48,688
When you come back.

992
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:54,048
I'm going to call you
on this phone.

993
01:06:55,248 --> 01:06:58,768
Open the front door.
Let me in.

994
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,528
And we'll take the money.

995
01:07:03,008 --> 01:07:06,128
And you won't have
to worry about it any more.

996
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:11,408
Understand?

997
01:07:29,368 --> 01:07:31,928
You make sure your
phone's switched on.

998
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:38,928
...fifteen.

999
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:41,448
You take one side and we'll
take the other and then swap.

1000
01:07:41,568 --> 01:07:42,888
- All right.
- Ok change what you can

1001
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:44,609
and what you can't change spend.

1002
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:45,969
Have a ball!

1003
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:50,649
You do realise, you just
kissed goodbye to the money.

1004
01:07:50,769 --> 01:07:52,209
Come on let's get cracking.

1005
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:54,249
She's going to run off with it,
you must know that?

1006
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:56,769
- Come on!
- How can she, she's got Damian?

1007
01:07:56,889 --> 01:07:59,849
She'll kidnap him, hold him to ransom
for the rest of the money.

1008
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:02,809
No, Anthony,
that's what you'd do. Come on.

1009
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:14,529
Ok, you wait here all right?

1010
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:23,169
It's mine.

1011
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:31,289
We'll have to change more
than this.

1012
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,369
- No!
- What?

1013
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:33,689
That's the whole point,

1014
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,129
do it in small amounts and
no one will be suspicious.

1015
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:38,609
Look at the queue.
Look at the time.

1016
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:40,409
We'll be lucky to get round
three banks at this rate.

1017
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:42,529
You'll be lucky to stay
out the jail.

1018
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:43,969
- Go on!
- What?

1019
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:47,809
It's just quite
a lot in the circumstances.

1020
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,169
It's five thousand quid.

1021
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,369
It's the front half
of a Ford Fiesta.

1022
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:53,289
Is this a bank or a sweet shop?

1023
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:58,529
- What?
- I need a wee.

1024
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:00,169
Tell her that.

1025
01:09:00,289 --> 01:09:01,489
Can I use your loo?

1026
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:04,289
- Well I'm not sure...
- Well I'm not queuing up again,

1027
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:06,209
the poor kid's been
in here half an hour.

1028
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:07,369
You must have a loo?

1029
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:09,089
What do you do
when you need to go?

1030
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,769
Ok, just this once.

1031
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:26,249
You'll have to go here.

1032
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,089
I don't really need one.

1033
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:32,770
You little belter.

1034
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,490
I just can't see
why it's so difficult.

1035
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,490
I need a wee.

1036
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,210
It's the front half of a Ford Fiesta,
as far as I'm concerned, that's...

1037
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,130
I need a wee. I need a wee.

1038
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,970
Today's the day, that Britain enters
a new currency era.

1039
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,930
You must spend or bank
any remaining old money today.

1040
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,130
It's now or never.
Use it or lose it.

1041
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,850
At midnight tonight,
it's euros only for British business.

1042
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:18,250
Well if you say so for business...
business is... now what was your name.

1043
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,210
- What?
- I've got an idea.

1044
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,130
- What?
- Dollars.

1045
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,010
Change it into dollars now
and change it into euros whenever.

1046
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,130
Actually once
all the excitement's over

1047
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,850
the euro will most
likely drop in value.

1048
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:33,010
So we'll probably get
a better exchange rate this way too.

1049
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:41,250
- What?
- Where did I get you?

1050
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:48,490
They've got a bank in there.
It stays open late.

1051
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,770
You know everything,
you do, don't you?

1052
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,010
Yeah.

1053
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,050
What's wrong?

1054
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,810
How did you know about the bank?

1055
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,450
Is this where your mum worked?
In here?

1056
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:13,971
Well stay there then.

1057
01:11:14,091 --> 01:11:15,771
You'll be alright.
I'll come straight back for you.

1058
01:11:15,891 --> 01:11:17,811
I'll do this one. Ok?

1059
01:11:34,731 --> 01:11:35,851
Don't look.

1060
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:44,171
This is where
your mum used to work.

1061
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:49,251
Nice.

1062
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,771
Best get a move on, huh?

1063
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:00,491
Go on.

1064
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:28,691
Damian? What you doing?

1065
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:31,931
Hey, what's up?

1066
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:37,011
Did you think I'd run off
and left you?

1067
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:39,611
Did you?

1068
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:42,091
Well I didn't, did I?

1069
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:43,411
No, you didn't.

1070
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:48,051
- The bank's upstairs.
- It's closed.

1071
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:53,691
And I've had a much better idea.
Come on.

1072
01:12:53,811 --> 01:12:55,611
Let's go and stuff our faces.

1073
01:13:09,772 --> 01:13:12,052
Oh I could have had my eye out.

1074
01:13:12,172 --> 01:13:13,092
Where are the glasses?

1075
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:15,932
Damian, wants to give
his to the poor.

1076
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:17,572
Do you?

1077
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:20,372
Of course they won't be poor anymore,
once you've given it to them.

1078
01:13:20,492 --> 01:13:22,452
What'll do you do then,
take it back?

1079
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:25,052
Speaking of which...

1080
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:29,572
Right mystery activity...
champagne.

1081
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,572
...follow me.

1082
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:43,972
A woman opens the door
in her nightie

1083
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:46,252
and I thought funny place
to keep a door...

1084
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:51,412
- This is your fault this.
- What is?

1085
01:13:51,572 --> 01:13:53,132
You don't even know, do you?

1086
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:55,092
You brought her
and you don't even know.

1087
01:13:55,212 --> 01:13:56,212
What are you on about?

1088
01:13:56,372 --> 01:13:57,652
Can you hear them laughing?

1089
01:13:57,812 --> 01:13:59,572
Even he's laughing. Listen.

1090
01:14:01,452 --> 01:14:02,572
Very good.

1091
01:14:04,532 --> 01:14:07,092
Once she's got what she came for,
she'll piss off again.

1092
01:14:07,212 --> 01:14:08,692
Then he won't be
laughing will he?

1093
01:14:08,852 --> 01:14:10,812
It will all start again
like when mam died.

1094
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:12,852
- He'll be angry...
- Maybe... she, you know,

1095
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:14,092
she won't, she'll stay.

1096
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:16,852
Oh great! Much better.
Is that what you want?

1097
01:14:17,012 --> 01:14:19,252
Her in there with him
instead of mam?

1098
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,292
Why are you angry with me?

1099
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:23,572
Because you did it.
You and your weird stuff.

1100
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,732
Chucking money away.
Talking to yourself. Seeing things.

1101
01:14:26,852 --> 01:14:29,212
I don't.
I mean maybe I do, but...

1102
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:30,932
And me! Sticking up for you.

1103
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:34,012
For what?
The truth is, you're a loony!

1104
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:36,692
Don't say that, Anthony.
Please don't say that!

1105
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:40,052
You're just a fucking loony
and you should be locked up.

1106
01:14:55,893 --> 01:14:59,213
Be at the front door
with the money in ten minutes.

1107
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:54,933
Damian! We were...
I was just...

1108
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:16,533
Dad, don't answer it.

1109
01:16:16,693 --> 01:16:18,733
- Dad don't.
- What is going on.

1110
01:16:18,893 --> 01:16:19,813
Please!

1111
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:22,013
See this little girls.
My girls.

1112
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:25,813
These girls Santa Claus forgot.
You're our last hope.

1113
01:16:25,973 --> 01:16:27,253
We haven't got a heater home.

1114
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:29,094
Because no point going back
if you don't help

1115
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:30,534
...took it out.
- Just...

1116
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:31,694
- Who is it?
- Excuse me please.

1117
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:34,254
Wheelchair like these
need your help.

1118
01:16:34,414 --> 01:16:35,614
Fifty percent of families

1119
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:37,654
with a chronically ill child,
break up.

1120
01:16:37,774 --> 01:16:38,894
You're maybe asking yourself

1121
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:41,374
why these Waterloo station
need friends.

1122
01:16:41,494 --> 01:16:42,934
Oh, Let me explain.

1123
01:16:43,054 --> 01:16:45,134
This is a mid of night.
This is a privat time.

1124
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:46,094
Who are you?

1125
01:16:46,214 --> 01:16:49,454
Get out please. Get mind.
Just leaving.

1126
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:50,974
Go on, you and your...
get out.

1127
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:52,534
- Come on
- Two euro's a month...

1128
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:54,054
- It's absolutely...
- Would you be prepared

1129
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,414
to consider a direct debit.

1130
01:17:05,494 --> 01:17:07,254
Just shut up, will you?

1131
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:30,854
Damian?
Damian?

1132
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:44,574
This is that same donkey
as he looks after

1133
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,214
just a few months
in our sanctuary.

1134
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:48,334
- I think you'll agree...
- All right love. Put him down.

1135
01:17:48,454 --> 01:17:49,454
Shall we?

1136
01:18:03,774 --> 01:18:05,854
You'd better tell me
how this started?

1137
01:18:06,574 --> 01:18:07,694
I've no idea.

1138
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:09,974
Some one must have said
something strange.

1139
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:11,214
Digital?

1140
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,814
Yeah that's right, yeah.

1141
01:18:13,974 --> 01:18:16,895
How do you find it?
I'm yet to be convinced.

1142
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:18,615
Well you can come and have a look,
when you get rid of that lot.

1143
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:20,055
Mmm. One step at a time, eh?

1144
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:22,095
Any chance of a bit of toast?

1145
01:18:22,215 --> 01:18:24,015
You do that,
I'll have a look around.

1146
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:32,055
Evening, lad.

1147
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:04,855
You.

1148
01:19:08,615 --> 01:19:10,415
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1149
01:19:10,535 --> 01:19:12,975
- Ha? Where is he?
- Upstairs.

1150
01:19:58,415 --> 01:20:00,216
Peaceful isn't it?

1151
01:20:00,816 --> 01:20:01,936
Who are you?

1152
01:20:05,216 --> 01:20:06,456
Who am I?

1153
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:11,416
Who are you?

1154
01:20:12,096 --> 01:20:13,816
We're the police.

1155
01:21:02,376 --> 01:21:03,376
Oh.

1156
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:09,536
I know you're only a dream.
But I don't care.

1157
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:13,056
It's nice to see you.
Even if you're just a dream.

1158
01:21:15,216 --> 01:21:17,656
The money just makes
everything worse.

1159
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:20,736
I've got something for you.

1160
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:23,336
From Readers Digest. Here.

1161
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:29,576
You may have already
won ten thousand pounds.

1162
01:21:31,896 --> 01:21:33,896
Please will you talk to me?

1163
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:38,576
Five minutes. Ok?

1164
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,457
Now, don't interrupt.
I'm dead.

1165
01:21:45,617 --> 01:21:47,777
I know what I'm talking about, ok?

1166
01:21:47,897 --> 01:21:50,177
You need to use conditioner
on your hair.

1167
01:21:50,297 --> 01:21:53,257
Your dad won't think of that,
but it makes all the difference.

1168
01:21:55,217 --> 01:21:56,337
Me?

1169
01:21:57,137 --> 01:21:59,577
You are not to worry about me.

1170
01:22:01,537 --> 01:22:03,417
You have been worrying about me,
haven't you?

1171
01:22:05,497 --> 01:22:06,897
I'm fine.

1172
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:09,657
Anthony.

1173
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,857
He seems to have taken
it better than you.

1174
01:22:12,977 --> 01:22:14,097
But he hasn't.

1175
01:22:14,217 --> 01:22:16,857
He's got a good heart,
he just...

1176
01:22:16,977 --> 01:22:18,457
he doesn't know where it is.

1177
01:22:18,617 --> 01:22:19,697
Damian?

1178
01:22:20,137 --> 01:22:22,977
He's going to need you.
Be good to him.

1179
01:22:23,097 --> 01:22:24,697
Dad doesn't believe.

1180
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,217
Doesn't believe what?

1181
01:22:27,337 --> 01:22:32,177
Any of it. Anything.
He mustn't do or he wouldn't.

1182
01:22:32,337 --> 01:22:33,537
Couldn't you talk to him?

1183
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,937
- He can't see me.
- Oh.

1184
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:37,977
Is it because of the money?

1185
01:22:38,097 --> 01:22:43,337
In a way. The money makes
it harder to see what's what.

1186
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:45,817
You know that already.

1187
01:22:51,777 --> 01:22:53,977
Never really win
with those things anyway.

1188
01:22:54,097 --> 01:22:55,217
You just end up
with books about

1189
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,617
the building of
the American Railways.

1190
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,697
It's her isn't it?

1191
01:23:04,657 --> 01:23:06,137
Your dad and her?

1192
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:09,897
Damian.

1193
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:18,137
You know how complicated
the money was?

1194
01:23:18,857 --> 01:23:22,457
Well... people are even more
complicated.

1195
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:25,217
You need to remember

1196
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:28,377
that there is nearly always enough
good around to be going on with.

1197
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:30,898
You've just got to have a bit
of faith, you know.

1198
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:33,858
And if you've got faith in people
that makes them stronger.

1199
01:23:33,978 --> 01:23:37,898
And you, you've got enough
to sort all three of you out.

1200
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:43,458
Hey? That's why
I'm counting on you.

1201
01:23:45,618 --> 01:23:48,178
I haven't really
been worried about you.

1202
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:49,978
I've just been missing you.

1203
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:52,818
That's allowed.

1204
01:23:54,898 --> 01:23:56,858
Are you really a Saint?

1205
01:23:57,858 --> 01:24:02,058
Well, the criteria's very strict.

1206
01:24:02,178 --> 01:24:05,138
It's notjust a case
of doing good and all that.

1207
01:24:05,258 --> 01:24:07,538
You do have to do
an actual miracle.

1208
01:24:08,138 --> 01:24:09,138
So...

1209
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:11,658
I'm in there. Course I am.

1210
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:13,578
What was your miracle?

1211
01:24:15,338 --> 01:24:16,658
Don't you know?

1212
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:20,018
It was you.

1213
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:32,818
Hey?

1214
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:35,738
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

1215
01:24:44,858 --> 01:24:45,898
Bye.

1216
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:32,219
Did you see her?

1217
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:34,619
What did she say?

1218
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:37,299
She said to tell
you not to worry.

1219
01:25:37,419 --> 01:25:39,379
It's all going to be alright.

1220
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:43,539
She's looking out for you

1221
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:46,499
Come on!

1222
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:03,059
Well it was fun
while it lasted, eh?

1223
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:14,899
Look there's no easy way to say this,

1224
01:26:15,019 --> 01:26:19,699
but I put a bit to one side,
for me, to spend.

1225
01:26:19,819 --> 01:26:21,419
You can have it back.

1226
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:24,979
Dorothy, six thousand,
three hundred and ten euros.

1227
01:26:25,099 --> 01:26:26,579
All for the best, eh?

1228
01:26:29,019 --> 01:26:30,139
Dollars.

1229
01:26:30,459 --> 01:26:31,979
It's just a few grand.

1230
01:26:32,099 --> 01:26:33,179
Dad?

1231
01:26:33,339 --> 01:26:34,619
Ten really.

1232
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:37,019
Eleven thousand,
four hundred dollars.

1233
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:38,459
I was going to tell you.

1234
01:26:38,979 --> 01:26:40,979
I sort of kept them by mistake.

1235
01:26:42,939 --> 01:26:44,019
Anthony.

1236
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:46,259
I just enjoyed having a wedge.

1237
01:26:46,379 --> 01:26:49,619
It wasn't really the money.
I just liked having it.

1238
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:52,859
Four thousand,
seven hundred and eighty euros.

1239
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,899
Dorothy wanted a holiday
of a lifetime.

1240
01:26:57,019 --> 01:26:58,459
Dad wanted to pay off
all his credit cards.

1241
01:26:58,579 --> 01:26:59,779
Come on Dad.

1242
01:26:59,899 --> 01:27:03,060
Anthony wanted
one game boy advanced xp.

1243
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:06,580
One play station three.
A Shogun new BMX bike.

1244
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,140
A Rekia five hundred super
quad bike.

1245
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,540
Nimbus two thousand
eltro-magnetic stair rider.

1246
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:16,380
A table top candy floss maker.
An iPOD, obviously.

1247
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,100
An i BOT obviously.

1248
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,580
And a stamp on it hydraulic
rocket capable of

1249
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,020
a attaining altitudes
of over one hundred metres.

1250
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,340
Three...

1251
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,780
Two...

1252
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,020
One...

1253
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,180
That's how Anthony
would want this story to end.

1254
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,980
With big piles of stuff.

1255
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:48,780
But it's not his story.
It's mine.

1256
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,180
Oh, regarde ca.
Qu'est-ce-que c'est?

1257
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,220
This is where I want it to end.

1258
