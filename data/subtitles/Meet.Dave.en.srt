1
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:33,634
Dude, dude, no, I was, like,
"Yes, we do have nuclear missiles."

2
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:35,427
And he was all, like, "No, you don't."

3
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:38,389
And I was all, like,
"Yes, we do. Whatever."

4
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,809
And then I was, like,
"Well, what part of 'whatever'

5
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,435
"do you not get?"

6
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,139
Josh? Josh?

7
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,022
Hey! How many times have I told
you kids not to play ball in this alley?

8
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,816
- Mom!
- Are you all right?

9
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:34,486
I'm fine. It wasn't a baseball.
There was this thing!

10
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,448
It came from space! It almost hit me!

11
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,075
- A thing came from space?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:44,538
You have the biggest imagination, mister.

13
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,081
- But...
- Come here.

14
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,541
- I'm glad you're all right.
- But...

15
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,543
No buts.
It's time to get ready for bed, please.

16
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:53,672
Here. And don't walk over there
until I pick up that glass, okay?

17
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,720
Awesome.

18
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,009
Knox. Dooley.

19
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,387
Got a report on some kind of fireball
or something like that

20
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,223
over on Liberty Island. Check it out.

21
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,185
No way. A fireball. Cool.
We'll get right on it.

22
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,728
Sarge, can't you get
somebody else to handle it?

23
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:15,191
- Come on, we just pulled an all-nighter.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox. Tell you what.

24
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,110
Lay down in my office,
and then I'll come by with your blankie,

25
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,446
and you can get yourself a nice nap.

26
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,741
Come on, it's gonna be great. A fireball?
How often do we get a call like that?

27
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,578
Do me a favor, okay?
Act like a cop and stop caring.

28
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,924
Oh, my God.

29
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,845
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you all right?

30
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,347
Hello? Please don't be dead!

31
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,266
Oh, did you see that?
He came out of nowhere!

32
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,727
It kind of looked
like you sped up to hit him.

33
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,564
I was going for the parking spot!
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,190
Oh, Jesus!

35
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,944
Are you all right?

36
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,156
Are you okay? Hello?
Please say something.

37
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:49,036
Oh, my God, his foot!
I'll call an ambulance!

38
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,413
Oh, God.
Please stay alive, please stay alive,

39
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:55,751
please stay alive, please stay alive.
This is such bad karma from...

40
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:00,964
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

41
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,300
Mr. Guy?

42
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,693
- This will take some time.
- Copy that.

43
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:17,458
All clear.

44
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,058
Repairs underway, sir.

45
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:37,395
Damage report.

46
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,868
Right Arm, all well.

47
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,619
Left Arm, ready.

48
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,876
- Casualties, Doctor?
- Abrasions, contusions.

49
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,128
Nothing significant, Captain.

50
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,174
Engineering?

51
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,718
Running diagnostics, sir.

52
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:13,056
Lieutenant Buttocks, what is your status?

53
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:17,393
Captain, we had a small gas leak.
It was silent, but not deadly.

54
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,527
Well, crew, it seems
our ship has survived the impact.

55
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,156
Actually, diagnostics
are not encouraging, Captain.

56
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:33,534
This collision was unexpected,
so our impact shields weren't activated.

57
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:36,371
How long can we operate at full capacity?

58
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:40,750
Forty-eight Earth hours at most.
After that, system functions will fail.

59
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,836
- And our tracking computer?
- Down, sir.

60
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:46,631
That means we only have
the last known coordinates of the orb.

61
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:51,094
It can be anywhere within 10,000
square meters of our current location.

62
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,513
No. 2, Options?

63
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,642
We could continue on the mission, sir,
but it's extremely risky.

64
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,312
The prudent course would be
to return to our home planet, Nil,

65
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,231
and repair the ship.

66
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:08,237
Assemble the crew.

67
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:13,409
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for
an address by your esteemed captain!

68
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:19,790
This is it.

69
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:23,043
This is the moment
that we've all been training for.

70
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:25,003
We all know what's at stake.

71
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:29,258
Our planet is on the verge
of a catastrophic energy crisis.

72
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,218
The device we sent to this world
to drain its oceans

73
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:35,723
has been knocked off course
and is lost somewhere in this city.

74
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,768
Once it is found and deployed,
the salt from this world

75
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,813
shall power our home world
for ages to come.

76
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:49,319
Without it, our people
will perish in less than one generation.

77
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,864
I will not permit that to happen.

78
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,825
We must succeed.

79
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,705
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

80
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,582
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

81
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,043
Back to your posts.

82
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,587
No. 3.

83
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,338
Do we have sufficient
linguistic information

84
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,715
to help communicate with these natives?

85
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:13,343
Yes. I tapped into their central
planetary databank, named "Google."

86
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,512
What a frivolous name
for such a vital function.

87
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,891
Well, if you prefer,
there's another called "Yahoo!"

88
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,809
Baffling.

89
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,811
- What about...
- Cultural and historical references?

90
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,731
- Already on it, Captain.
- Good.

91
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:29,359
- No. 4, is security prepared?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,738
My team can handle any threat
posed by these gargantuan savages.

93
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,865
- Good.
- Initial reports confirm

94
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,116
that draining this planet's oceans

95
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,495
would have
a catastrophic effect on existing life.

96
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,084
We have orders, No. 3.
Our entire home world is depending on us.

97
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,919
Agreed.

98
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,255
We should not lament
the fates of these inferior creatures.

99
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,257
If the orb has fallen into their hands,

100
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:55,053
who knows for what nefarious purpose
they could be using it

101
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:56,888
at this very moment?

102
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,616
Mom, there's a drunk guy
in the alley again!

103
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:19,911
- That's him.
- Who?

104
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,747
- The guy I just hit with my car.
- You're kidding. Again?

105
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,291
Oh, I barely clipped that other guy.

106
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,085
Sir, coronal gas readings just spiked.

107
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,713
- The orb must be nearby.
- Hello?

108
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:33,258
Hello, sir, hi. Hello? Hi, there.

109
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:36,886
- Hello, sir? Hi, are you all right?
- Contact, everyone!

110
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,972
- Because you just ran off.
- No. 17.

111
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,223
- Return to the ship.
- Copy.

112
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:44,102
I'm worried. I really feel terrible
about what just happened.

113
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,812
Can I call you an ambulance or something?

114
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,815
Any medical attention for... For your foot?

115
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:53,236
Your foot.

116
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,822
Our first verbal encounter.

117
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,533
Thank you for your concern.

118
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,744
Thank you for your concern.

119
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:04,247
It's way too high. More bass!

120
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,708
Thank you for your concern.

121
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,293
Level the frequency.

122
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,129
I'm all better now.

123
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:14,382
How hard did you hit this guy?

124
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:18,928
It's time for you to go
to school before you're late, okay?

125
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,056
Mom...

126
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,559
See how she squeezes the smaller
one's skull despite his protests.

127
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:26,479
- Stop! Stop!
- Such brutality!

128
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,481
- Go on. Goodbye.
- Stop!

129
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:30,816
Hey, safety first. And if those boys
are after you, you tell me!

130
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,986
- I'm calling their parents.
- Okay.

131
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:37,156
Would you like to come upstairs for
a glass of water, maybe? Anything?

132
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,241
I can help clean you up.

133
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,118
No, thank you. I am fine.

134
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,870
I am in position.

135
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,164
Are you sure?

136
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,918
Okay, but, see, that's not fine.

137
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,879
So, maybe you should come upstairs,
or I can call an ambulance.

138
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,548
Sir, we cannot let her
contact the authorities.

139
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:58,427
Agreed. We will go in long enough
to put her mind at ease.

140
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:02,181
Yes, I will accompany you.
Thank you for your hospitality.

141
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:04,016
Good.

142
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:08,562
The thing about my car is,
you gotta pump the brakes.

143
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:09,897
I mean, I just got it back from the shop,

144
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,774
and I'm seriously considering
suing my mechanic,

145
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:13,776
because that was just crazy
about what happened.

146
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,528
Oh, sorry, right here! Oh, sorry, right here.

147
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,490
- Hey.
- Hey!

148
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:20,866
- How you doing?
- How are you?

149
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,452
Good. Good timing.
I got something for you.

150
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,788
Three tubes of cerulean blue.

151
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,333
- I just ran out.
- Hi. Mark Rhodes.

152
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,336
Why does he thrust his arm towards us?

153
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,672
Probably best to imitate him.

154
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:37,133
Hi. Mark Rhodes.

155
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,513
Lefty, huh? Hey.

156
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,940
- All right.
- All right.

157
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,526
Okay.

158
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,447
- All right.
- All right.

159
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,910
Okay.

160
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:08,415
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

161
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,625
- We're going right inside.
- All right, yeah.

162
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,101
Okay, here you go.

163
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:30,103
Sorry about the mess.

164
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:36,151
You know, this is sort of
a workspace/home combo thingy, thing.

165
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,452
Right Arm. This is unacceptable.

166
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:48,497
Sorry! The liquid shifts the equilibrium!

167
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,753
- I still seem to be a bit shaken up.
- Oh, crap.

168
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:14,439
- There, I feel much better now.
- Oh, good! That is great.

169
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:15,482
Great news. Good.

170
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:18,318
So then, you don't need to call
your lawyer, or anything crazy like that,

171
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:21,655
because that would be just pointless,
wouldn't it?

172
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:24,282
Good. Oh, I'm Gina, by the way.

173
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,994
Gina Morrison.

174
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,455
And you are?

175
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,750
Three?

176
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:37,129
This is a list of the most common
names on this planet.

177
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:38,880
My name is...

178
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,635
- Ming Chang.
- Ming Chang?

179
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,974
Sorry. Sorry, you just struck me
more like a Dave, or something.

180
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,685
Which happens to be my other name.

181
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,187
Dave Ming Chang?

182
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,023
Dave Ming Chang.

183
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,069
Dave Ming Chang. All right, well, Dave,

184
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:04,240
I feel just terrible about this whole thing,
and I was gonna have some breakfast.

185
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,575
Would you like to join me?

186
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,578
- No, I really have to be going now.
- Are you sure?

187
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,081
I mean, I sort of have a rule that,
when I hit somebody with my car,

188
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:14,500
I need to make them breakfast.

189
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,005
That was a joke.

190
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,101
So where are you from?
Do you live around here?

191
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:35,271
Yes, of course. I am just a regular
person from right here on Earth,

192
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,939
just like you.

193
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,609
I just don't get out that much.

194
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:43,404
Yeah, judging from your suit,
I'd say since about 1978.

195
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:48,242
Note, all-white apparel is not
as standardized as we thought.

196
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,578
You late for a Bee Gees concert
or something?

197
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,956
The Bee Gees. Barry, Robin and Maurice,
the Brothers Gibb.

198
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,418
Winning ten Grammy awards
and selling over 100,000,000 records.

199
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:59,670
Oh, you can tell by the way I use my walk

200
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,881
I'm a woman's man No time to talk

201
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,343
Stayin' alive

202
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,932
Wow. That's impressive
love for the Bee Gees, man.

203
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,643
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
You know? Foot in the mouth.

204
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,270
Listen, do you mind
whipping these up for me?

205
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,022
That would be so great. Just a little help.

206
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:21,526
I'm so used to making breakfast for Josh,
and all he wants is waffles.

207
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,404
Anyway, he's off to school now.

208
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:25,864
Yeah, I don't know,
he's got these bullies after him right now.

209
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:26,990
You don't have any kids, do you?

210
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,284
I mean, you don't really seem
like a kid person, but...

211
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:31,870
Anyway, I just, I try to be there for him,

212
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,747
but I don't really know
how to deal with it, you know.

213
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:38,043
I'm just doing the single mom thing,
and I'm so permissive of everything.

214
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,879
Oh, my God, I am talking your ear off.

215
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:47,010
- All is well.
- Okay, why don't you just take a seat?

216
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,555
And I can finish this.

217
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:51,473
Here, you like ketchup?

218
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,892
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

219
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,823
Refreshing. I feel much better now.

220
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,203
That's a new one.

221
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,335
Oh, that's our cat, Boris.
I hope you're not allergic.

222
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,171
Are you?

223
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,173
Cats. Here we go, sir.

224
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,516
Boris, what are you up to?

225
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:39,563
- Captain.
- Yes?

226
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,733
Yes, my husband was
a captain with the Navy.

227
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,154
- I am a captain.
- Really? A captain of what?

228
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,658
I am a captain of crunch.

229
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:58,248
- Where is your captain now?
- Frank died four years ago,

230
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,626
so it's just me and Josh now.

231
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,421
It's been rough sometimes,
but we're okay.

232
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,883
There is a strength to this one.

233
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,511
Captain, the orb!

234
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:19,896
Where was this image captured?

235
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:24,150
That's Josh at school, the science fair.
He always walks around with this thing.

236
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:27,237
See, he thinks it fell from outer space.

237
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:30,365
- We must locate the boy.
- We're on it, sir.

238
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:32,242
729 East 44th Street.

239
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:36,121
I really have to be going now.
Thank you for the ketchup.

240
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:40,959
Okay. You know,
the eggs are just another...

241
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:45,630
That's the closet.

242
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,596
Sorry about hitting you with my car.

243
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:57,517
A couple of frat punks get drunk,
miss the last ferry,

244
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,770
stick a rag in their bottle of Stoli,
and then, kaboom!

245
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:04,107
Suddenly, my morning roll in the hay
with Tracy gets canceled.

246
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:06,735
I think this is explosive residue.

247
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:13,199
Don't. Don't do this, Dooley.
I see you getting interested in this.

248
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:16,244
I see that wacko X Files gleam in your eye.

249
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:31,342
That might be the boy, there!
In that group of Earth children.

250
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:32,427
What structure is this?

251
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,764
It appears to be
some sort of shrine to technology.

252
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:48,736
This is the best they have to offer?
Their mini-computers are gigantic!

253
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:52,782
And a slamming home page
means more online buddies.

254
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:55,659
Dude, while you're waiting,
check these out.

255
00:21:55,743 --> 00:22:00,831
Awesome surround-sound headphones.
Seven ounces, left and right quad.

256
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:03,167
The sound will blow you away.

257
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,837
Is that insane?

258
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:09,799
It's like the subwoofers
are actually inside your head.

259
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:15,012
Damage reports coming in
from all parts of the ship, Captain!

260
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,681
Sir! Structural integrity weakening!

261
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:27,149
We have got to get out of here!

262
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:41,872
The sign clearly indicates, "Do not walk."

263
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:47,128
And yet, they keep walking
and walking and walking!

264
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:51,590
Apparently, chaos
is the order of the day here.

265
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,134
Doctor,

266
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,429
is Two all right?

267
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,889
This is a big planet.

268
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:03,144
There might be contaminants
we've never encountered before.

269
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:04,353
I'll keep an eye on it.

270
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:37,012
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.

271
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,769
It's the ice cream man!

272
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:45,604
Ice cream man, over here!

273
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:48,940
- Ice cream!
- Hey, look, it's the Good Humor man!

274
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,111
It's this suit again!

275
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:55,238
How in Nil did we wind up
with this wardrobe debacle?

276
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:58,450
- We must have missed something.
- I can't see how, sir.

277
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,828
We carefully studied the only signal
ever intercepted from Earth.

278
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:04,706
The plane! The plane!

279
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,460
When we enter the boy's school,

280
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:11,421
we must not draw any
undue attention to ourselves.

281
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:14,883
Yes, we must rid ourselves
of this inappropriate attire

282
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:19,679
and replace it with clothing that is
the epitome of both hip and now.

283
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:21,556
Welcome to Old Navy!

284
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:28,313
- Any ideas?
- Likely a ritual greeting, sir.

285
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:29,940
Welcome to Old Navy!

286
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,528
- Welcome to Old Navy!
- Welcome to Old Navy!

287
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,446
Welcome to Old Navy!

288
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,073
Welcome to Old Navy!

289
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:40,909
Welcome to Old Navy.

290
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:46,164
Welcome to Old Navy!

291
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:52,003
Welcome to Old Navy.

292
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:55,632
Can I help you find your size?

293
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:59,845
I am obviously
the same size as everyone else.

294
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,514
I just meant are you a small, or...

295
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:11,524
I believe he simply wants to know
the dimensions of your clothing.

296
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:15,862
Yes, you can help me find my size.

297
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:17,780
Welcome to Old Navy.

298
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:22,994
Crew, prepare for
an unrehearsed maneuver.

299
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,920
Come on!

300
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:36,841
- What the...
- Sorry, sir! It won't happen again!

301
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:44,724
I can help you if you'd...
How about I help you take that.

302
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,101
Very...

303
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:50,313
Yes, this is my size. Welcome to Old Navy!

304
00:25:55,526 --> 00:26:00,156
Excuse me. Do you have a private chamber
where I can try on these garments?

305
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:02,867
Changing room back there behind hoodies.

306
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,410
Welcome to Old Navy.

307
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,105
Sir, we have arrived at the school.

308
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,274
This can't be right.

309
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:42,115
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes

310
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:44,742
Apologies, sir.

311
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:47,203
Apparently we are on West 44th Street.

312
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:55,295
One smile
and suddenly nobody else will do

313
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:01,635
Let's get out of here. Double-time.

314
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,066
- Hey!
- What do you got here, little freak?

315
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,571
- That's mine!
- What do you use it for, playing nerd-ball?

316
00:27:20,654 --> 00:27:23,615
- Whatever it is, it's mine now.
- Give it back!

317
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:26,160
Or what?
You gonna tell your mommy again?

318
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:28,162
Can I help you?

319
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,748
I am here for the fifth-grade classroom.

320
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,333
Okay, all right, you're very late,
but you're here, at least.

321
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,837
It's been a madhouse.
Half the teachers are out with the flu.

322
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to
throw you to the wolves.

323
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:48,474
Don't say a word. I will mess you up.

324
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,144
Josh Morrison.

325
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,646
What are you doing here?
Are you the sub?

326
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,107
You would know the sub, loser!

327
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,445
I don't know him!
My mom hit him with her van!

328
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:04,364
I am Dave Ming Chang, the sub.

329
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:11,038
What is your name?

330
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,083
- Smellmy.
- Smellmy what?

331
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,876
Smellmy Buttcrack.

332
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,589
I am sure the other Buttcracks
would disapprove of your behavior.

333
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,925
You don't look like a teacher.

334
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,803
I'm going to report you.

335
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:29,890
- Vaporize the child at once!
- Delay that order.

336
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:35,397
I am indeed your temporary instructor,
which I shall prove to you now. Observe.

337
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,400
Let's teach them something simple,
shall we?

338
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,081
What the...

339
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:04,050
The unified field theory. The ultimate
pearl of wisdom in all of the universe.

340
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,010
Now you are educated.

341
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:09,472
- What is your destination?
- I'm gonna sharpen my pencil.

342
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,474
Here, let me assist you.

343
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,483
- There.
- Thanks, I think.

344
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,654
Josh Morrison. Come with me.

345
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:30,452
What are you doing here?
You're not really the sub, are you?

346
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,079
You have something that is mine.

347
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:38,084
It is a small spherical device,
2.7 inches in diameter.

348
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:39,836
How'd you hear about that?

349
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,465
And how can it be yours
if it came from outer space?

350
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,800
Are you an alien?

351
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:47,719
We've been compromised!

352
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:49,888
I'm just messing with you.

353
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,934
That's very funny.
It's very important that I find it.

354
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:57,020
Do you know where it is?

355
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,441
Let me guess.
It's, like, top secret or something.

356
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:04,486
Yes. It is top secret or something.

357
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:08,740
Will you help us, I mean me, find it?

358
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:13,204
Look, I don't have it anymore.
This jerk took it.

359
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:16,374
Well, we have to get it back.

360
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:18,709
- Where is this jerk?
- His name is Rich.

361
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,295
Him and his buddies are
probably headed for the deli.

362
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:24,173
- Lead and I will follow.
- Okay, come on.

363
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,440
Such disturbing images.

364
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:47,029
- Rich isn't here.
- Do you know where Rich lives?

365
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,949
No, but sometimes
I run into him in the neighborhood.

366
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:52,159
Everybody on the floor, now!

367
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:55,037
Empty the register and no one gets hurt.

368
00:30:56,247 --> 00:31:00,126
This planet continues
to reveal its ugly nature.

369
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,919
It deserves its fate.

370
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:06,090
- I said, on the floor, now!
- I am already on the floor.

371
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:09,176
Gravity prevents me from floating off of it.

372
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,637
Get down now!

373
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:19,729
Big mistake, man.

374
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,491
Hey, you have forgotten your weapon!

375
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:35,453
Dave, wait!

376
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:39,874
That was awesome! I mean, you
totally threw that guy across the room.

377
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,752
I was very fortunate not to be injured.

378
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:46,714
And the gun.
No normal person could have done that.

379
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:49,300
Do you have, like,
superpowers or something?

380
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:50,760
Do you know
what would be very pleasant?

381
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,680
If we were to change
the subject of our conversation.

382
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:56,183
Did you see
last night's sports competition?

383
00:31:56,308 --> 00:32:00,103
You see? There's another thing.
You talk so weird.

384
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:02,981
- Come on, tell me, what's your secret?
- I have no secret.

385
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:07,069
- Oh, yeah? Quick, where are you from?
- I am from right here in this city.

386
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,780
Where exactly? Give me an address.

387
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,200
The Statue of Liberty.

388
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,368
You live at the Statue of Liberty?

389
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:18,830
Yes, the Ming Changs have lived at the
Statue of Liberty for many generations.

390
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:21,750
Now, let us locate the orb.

391
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:25,796
Look, I don't know where Rich is now,
but tomorrow's my mom's birthday.

392
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,965
We're going to our neighborhood
street fair. Everybody goes.

393
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,468
I'm sure he's gonna be there.

394
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,263
You know, if you want,
you could come with me and my mom.

395
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,935
Sir, we can't wait until tomorrow.
Our power supply is dwindling.

396
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,980
This child is useless.
We must find the orb on our own.

397
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,736
I disagree. Without guidance,
we might not find it in time.

398
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:54,324
Contrary to expectations,
Josh has been quite helpful to us.

399
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:55,867
We will stick with him.

400
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,540
Man, you are awesome at this!

401
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,626
It's like you've got
super video-game powers, too.

402
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,838
- Are you sure you're not a superhero?
- Absolutely.

403
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:12,342
Fine, I give up. I'm just happy to be
able to play with somebody besides Mom.

404
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,386
Interacting with your mother
makes you unhappy?

405
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:17,222
Nah, I don't mean to complain. She tries.

406
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,016
It's just that Dad was a lot better.

407
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:22,310
You know, my dad was a hero in real life.

408
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:26,314
- He saved, like, a million people one time.
- That is impressive.

409
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:28,734
Yeah, we miss him. Especially Mom.

410
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:31,695
Now she spends all her time
smothering me.

411
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:35,157
- She cuts off your air supply?
- Josh, I'm home!

412
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:38,703
Oh, hey! What are you doing back here?

413
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,413
Some guys with a gun
tried to rob the store,

414
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,457
and Dave stopped them
and saved everyone!

415
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,667
- It was awesome!
- What? What gun?

416
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:45,918
- Mom, Mom.
- Are you all right?

417
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,339
Mom, I'm fine! It was so cool!
Dave just took them out.

418
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:52,717
Man, I wish I could do that.
But look at me.

419
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,762
I'm the smallest fifth-grader
in New York City.

420
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:59,974
- You are not small. You are a giant.
- Yeah, right.

421
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:08,066
Josh, the most powerful force
in all the universe

422
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:10,777
often comes from the smallest star.

423
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,036
Dave? Would you like to stay for supper?

424
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,707
Sir, the longer we're in their presence,
the greater the danger of exposure.

425
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:31,214
Yes, I will stay.

426
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,343
Good.

427
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:38,596
Although, if you thought
my driving was dangerous,

428
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,432
wait till you try my meatloaf.

429
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:42,517
Meat Loaf?

430
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,945
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

431
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:55,655
I'll tell you when I find it.

432
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:57,365
You know something, Dooley?
We gotta find you a new hobby.

433
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,034
Stevie, please just hold the insult.

434
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,119
Please.

435
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:03,246
Oh, I forgot today
was Arts and Crafts Day.

436
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:32,693
Dave, would you mind
helping me clear the table?

437
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:44,496
You know, don't worry about it.
I got it. I'm...

438
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,914
This is something I do all the time.

439
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:49,793
I'm constantly dropping stuff.
Don't even worry about it.

440
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:53,172
"Men Are from Mars,
Women Are from Venus. "

441
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,967
Yeah, that's my...

442
00:35:57,051 --> 00:36:01,055
I would... My sister got that for me.
I would never...

443
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:03,557
She just thinks I need
to get back in the game, and...

444
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:07,478
Tell your sister there is no life on Mars!
Believe me.

445
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:10,189
Okay.

446
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,405
This rendering. What is it?

447
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:25,496
That's just something I felt.

448
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:30,501
- You felt this.
- Yeah, I did.

449
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:35,089
I did. I don't really paint like that anymore.

450
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,673
And why not?

451
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:39,802
Well, things have changed.

452
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:48,435
And what is the feeling
demonstrated here?

453
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:53,232
Well, how does it make you feel?

454
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:56,486
Feel?

455
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:04,452
It makes me feel off-balance.

456
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,371
Off-balance, yeah.

457
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:08,957
That's... That's close.

458
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,002
I remember when I painted this,
I just felt love.

459
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:15,547
Huge and exciting and crazy,

460
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:17,590
just love.

461
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:28,059
How do you know when you feel love?

462
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:31,479
Oh, I think when you feel love,

463
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:35,442
you don't need to ask that question.

464
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:39,654
I see.

465
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,080
Time for me to exit into the night.

466
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:51,833
Okay.

467
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:55,837
Well, thank you again
for being there for Josh today and...

468
00:37:56,629 --> 00:38:00,842
And, yeah, I think tomorrow will be fun.
I'm glad you're coming with us.

469
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,927
So am I, Gina Morrison.

470
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:06,598
Okay.

471
00:38:08,308 --> 00:38:10,810
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night, Gina.

472
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:27,952
Do you mind if I rest here?

473
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,663
Sure.

474
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:34,542
This appears to be a safe port.
We'll join this urban camper.

475
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:41,801
You ain't crazy, are you?

476
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:45,471
The last guy was here,
he said he was from outer space.

477
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,723
What planet?

478
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:51,060
And the party continues.

479
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:56,816
Here. Here you go.
Gets a little chilly at night.

480
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:03,614
Did you see that?

481
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,783
This man has nothing,

482
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:09,245
yet he offers to share
his sole source of warmth.

483
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:12,540
Why?

484
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:16,252
It seems they are a more complex species
than we imagined.

485
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,640
- Yes?
- My findings are incomplete,

486
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:33,686
but I have noted more atypical behavior
spreading throughout the ship.

487
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,229
Is that so?

488
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:39,066
Well, I think we all just need
a good night's rest, Doctor.

489
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:03,424
- Dang!
- Excuse me?

490
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,442
Working rather late, No. 3.

491
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:23,278
I was just doing
some additional cultural research.

492
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,405
And what have you found?

493
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:29,910
I stumbled onto an interesting file
in the alien database, sir.

494
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:34,956
Every man, woman and child
is forced to view it once a year.

495
00:40:35,957 --> 00:40:38,752
It could be helpful in understanding them.

496
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,253
Show me.

497
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:45,759
You have not changed
since our days at the Academy.

498
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:48,470
I remember the late nights
studying together.

499
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:51,098
And the nutritious protein squares
you prepared for us.

500
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:54,726
I would not have been able to graduate
without your help.

501
00:40:56,186 --> 00:41:01,316
And, yet, here you've become
our generation's most renowned captain.

502
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,361
Yes.

503
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,532
Here it is.

504
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:16,164
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?

505
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:18,834
You want the moon? Just say the word

506
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,628
and I'll throw a lasso around it
and pull it down.

507
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,132
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

508
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,216
I'll take it.

509
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:52,617
Lasso the moon?

510
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:56,538
- Physically impossible!
- Absurd.

511
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:11,679
- Good night, Captain.
- Yes, Three, good night.

512
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:17,435
I must say, sir,
these Earth creatures keep surprising me.

513
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:20,897
A most confusing place.
It makes my head spin.

514
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,357
I guess I'd better hold on, then.

515
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:14,534
I want to send this out
to every precinct, every security company

516
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:17,578
and every hospital in the city
until we ID this guy right here.

517
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:21,040
This is incredible. Just amazing.

518
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:24,377
Amazing that two idiots like you
could've passed the police exam.

519
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,629
- See? I tried to tell him, Sarge.
- Hold on.

520
00:43:26,713 --> 00:43:30,049
It is a fact, a fact, that something
or someone has landed here.

521
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:33,219
Now, we could be making the biggest
scientific discovery of all time.

522
00:43:33,302 --> 00:43:37,014
I don't want to hear another word
about E.T., Bigfoot or the Tooth Fairy,

523
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:40,309
unless they're jacking some old lady's car.

524
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:43,981
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

525
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,191
- That's good aim, Sarge.
- Shut up!

526
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:50,612
- Dooley. What are you doing?
- I'm sending it anyway, Knox.

527
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:53,031
No, it's just a guy
who shoved his face in the dirt.

528
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:54,908
No, wrong. It is an alien,

529
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,079
an alien who shoved his face in the dirt,
and I am gonna find him.

530
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,930
Power reserves at 20%, sir.
That only gives us about 12 hours.

531
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:20,809
Then every minute counts.
Remember our mission, crew.

532
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:24,146
We must find the boy with the orb.
No distractions.

533
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,930
This is not acceptable!

534
00:44:59,473 --> 00:45:00,724
And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

535
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:04,061
Chuck starts off fast out of the gate,
eating down those dogs,

536
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:09,358
but Earl and Homer are right behind him.
Look at them go! Look at them go!

537
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,320
- Come on, Dave, eat!
- Dave, just put it in your mouth!

538
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:17,324
- What are you doing? Eat it!
- Just put one in your mouth, Dave!

539
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:21,203
- Put it in, come on, now!
- Dave! Dave, eat!

540
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:23,915
You never should have
signed him up for this.

541
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:29,546
- What are you doing, Dave? Eat!
- Eat it, Dave! Put it in your mouth!

542
00:45:31,923 --> 00:45:33,800
Yeah, all right! Yeah! Yeah!

543
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,303
A little heads-up might be nice!

544
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:45,019
Hey! Can a brother
get some hot sauce with that?

545
00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:47,397
Look at him go!

546
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:04,914
Our champion!
Eighty-five delicious all-beef hot dogs!

547
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:06,124
Yeah!

548
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,879
Yeah, boy! Yeah!

549
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,383
Well executed, Captain.

550
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:19,429
Dave, that was amazing!
You are a wiener-eating champ!

551
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:21,806
And here's the grand prize.

552
00:46:24,934 --> 00:46:26,686
We're under attack!

553
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:29,481
It's the creature from Thanos 7!
Battle stations!

554
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:33,193
You have menaced us
for the last time, you beast!

555
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,125
It seems that this is
an inanimate creature.

556
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:52,420
At ease!

557
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:57,133
The question is, what are we expected
to do with this plush amphibian?

558
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:00,637
Give it to her, Captain.

559
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:04,767
The female. Give it to her.

560
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:09,522
Silly goose.

561
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:14,068
You are such a goofball.

562
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:25,329
For me? Thanks, Dave. That was...

563
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:27,498
That's very sweet.

564
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,500
Red alert, Captain! Red alert!

565
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,923
We need to dispose of the large quantity
of processed meat tubes!

566
00:47:37,508 --> 00:47:38,968
Excuse me.

567
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:42,138
My colon is impacted.

568
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,059
Okay.

569
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,501
Show-off!

570
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:20,885
Excuse me! Excuse me, we met yesterday.

571
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,471
- Mark Rhodes.
- Mark Rhodes?

572
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,725
- Right. The left again.
- Yeah.

573
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,032
- So, you here by yourself?
- No, I am not.

574
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:45,160
I am accompanying Josh and Gina.

575
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:48,163
All evening we have been
screaming with fear and delight.

576
00:48:48,246 --> 00:48:51,291
Look, you and I
should get something straight,

577
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,627
and I'm not trying to
step on your toes, here.

578
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,879
If you're serious about Gina,
then that's great,

579
00:48:55,962 --> 00:48:58,799
because she deserves
a decent guy in her life,

580
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,510
but if I find out that you're just
trying to take advantage of her,

581
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:03,970
and you're using Josh to do it,

582
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:06,973
you and I
are gonna have a serious problem.

583
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,936
You understand what I'm saying?

584
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,564
Yes, I understand completely,
Mark Rhodes.

585
00:49:16,024 --> 00:49:18,193
Does anyone here understand
what this man is talking about?

586
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:21,196
He's trying to discern if you intend
on becoming Gina's mate.

587
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:22,739
What an absurd notion!

588
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:26,701
I intend on becoming Gina's mate?
She's the size of our science pavilion.

589
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:30,288
These primitive creatures
and their silly speculations!

590
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:33,834
Wait! What's that?

591
00:49:35,377 --> 00:49:38,380
- What do you want, midget?
- Rich, you gotta give me my rock back.

592
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,506
Oh, really? Why?

593
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:41,883
Because it's really important
to me and my friend, Dave.

594
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,343
It's the jerk we seek!

595
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:45,554
Rich, you've gotta give me my rock back!

596
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:48,348
Boy, it's like
you're asking me to punch you!

597
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,101
So, Smellmy, we meet again.

598
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,436
Dave.

599
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,819
Stop! You're giving me a wedgie!

600
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:07,367
Stop! Please put me down, already!

601
00:50:13,415 --> 00:50:15,709
Smellmy, are you crying
because you are sad

602
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:19,796
or because your undergarments are
lodged so cuttingly deep in your rectum?

603
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,965
I'm telling my mom.

604
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,384
Mom! Mom!

605
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:29,432
Dave, that was unbelievable! High-five!

606
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:35,480
They don't high-five where you're from?

607
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:38,191
- No, but they should.
- There you two are!

608
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:39,776
What kind of trouble you getting into?

609
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:44,697
Nothing. Dave was just about
to try out his pitching arm!

610
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,242
- Come on, Dave.
- Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

611
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:51,871
- You just gotta hit three. Here we go.
- Come on! Come on, come on!

612
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:53,706
Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

613
00:50:54,874 --> 00:51:01,547
Sir, the orb is ours.
This charade is no longer necessary.

614
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:05,218
It's time to throw it in the ocean
and head home.

615
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:08,096
You're absolutely right, Two,

616
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:12,266
but I really think I can do this.

617
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,686
He looks very serious.

618
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,355
Looking good, looking good.
Come on, you can do it!

619
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:19,190
Here we go. He's gonna do it!

620
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:21,984
Wind up!

621
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:26,030
All right, well...

622
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:29,409
Spectacularly unsuccessful!
Why was my wrist so limp?

623
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:32,203
I was in the bathroom.

624
00:51:35,123 --> 00:51:36,457
On my command.

625
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,918
- Come on, you can hit it.
- Two more. Come on.

626
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,586
Come on. Come on.

627
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,633
Fire!

628
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,928
Incoming!

629
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:55,143
Engineer, report!

630
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:59,355
All sensors are down and the sun shields
deployed upon impact.

631
00:51:59,439 --> 00:52:01,357
Sir, we're blacked out.

632
00:52:08,198 --> 00:52:11,201
The sun is exploding in my face!

633
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:15,038
I still haven't got a pulse.
Give me the paddles, stat.

634
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:17,374
- Oh, God. Don't watch.
- Clear!

635
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:21,128
Come on. Give me more juice.

636
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:22,463
Clear!

637
00:52:26,216 --> 00:52:27,968
Power has been restored.

638
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:31,555
Oh, thank God!
Oh, God, is he gonna be okay?

639
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:34,933
We'll do an MRI just to be safe.

640
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:36,852
He's okay. He's okay.

641
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:42,107
How we doing? I have to warm it up first,

642
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:44,860
but just to double-check,
they took your keys, watch, coins?

643
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:46,820
- Yes.
- Good.

644
00:52:46,904 --> 00:52:50,991
'Cause people always forget
the "M" in MRI stands for "magnetic."

645
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,579
This'll just take a second.

646
00:53:03,754 --> 00:53:06,340
I guess I still have a few pennies.

647
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:09,843
I'm so sorry to have ruined your birthday.

648
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:12,471
Thanks for letting the cat out of the bag.

649
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:15,516
- Cat? Where's the cat?
- You know, it's okay,

650
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,811
because I'm not really
one for celebrating anyway.

651
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:21,647
Well, perhaps you will reconsider
and let us take you out for dinner.

652
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,190
Yeah.

653
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:28,695
Sir, with all due respect,
have you lost your mind?

654
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:32,574
They've helped us.
The least we can do is try to help them.

655
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:36,245
You have become a fool!

656
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:39,915
Treating these lumbering giants
as if they're our equals.

657
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:42,960
You've made a mockery
of our entire mission!

658
00:53:43,627 --> 00:53:46,422
You get out of my face. Now!

659
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,807
Dave?

660
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,600
Dave? Hello?

661
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,270
- Right here.
- Hey, where'd you go?

662
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:01,896
I am here.

663
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,942
I'm so curious sometimes,
what's going on in that head of yours.

664
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,278
I was just pondering which would be
the best place to take you

665
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:10,739
to commemorate your birthday.

666
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:14,284
Josh, do you have any suggestions?
Perhaps a nice Cuban place?

667
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:16,411
I know a great salsa restaurant.

668
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:21,291
All right, well, sí, amigos, let's go party.

669
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,253
Everyone! We're going to go and party!

670
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:48,068
Okay, three mojitos, one virgin.

671
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,486
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

672
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:51,446
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

673
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,656
- Thank you.
- There you go. You enjoy.

674
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,034
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

675
00:54:56,117 --> 00:54:57,744
Thank you.

676
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:01,581
Now, careful.
These go straight to your head.

677
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:25,814
This is not acceptable!

678
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,360
Slow down, cowboy.

679
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:34,865
This is the best!

680
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:38,494
Cougar46 just added me as a friend.

681
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:40,079
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

682
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,917
He walked out about an hour ago
with a nice-looking lady and a kid.

683
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:49,130
- Oh, really? Nice-looking? She pretty hot?
- Please! Please.

684
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,465
- You sure it's him?
- Absolutely.

685
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,801
Said they were going
to a Cuban salsa place.

686
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:09,567
You gotta try this.

687
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,571
It's like space travel, only in your head.

688
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:26,709
I've been having strange feelings
since we've arrived on this planet.

689
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:31,255
- It seems you are, too?
- Absolutely not.

690
00:56:31,297 --> 00:56:35,384
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm recalibrating our weapon systems.

691
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:36,635
Just a second.

692
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:45,811
Exactly what weapon
are you recalibrating?

693
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,938
Okay, let's talk.

694
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,941
I'm feeling a little busted.

695
00:56:56,489 --> 00:56:58,282
You know, pretty soon
you're gonna be too old

696
00:56:58,365 --> 00:56:59,617
to dance with your mom.

697
00:56:59,658 --> 00:57:02,411
Excuse me while I run to the restroom.

698
00:57:03,037 --> 00:57:04,497
Josh.

699
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,582
I will be going home soon.

700
00:57:11,546 --> 00:57:13,840
What is the matter with you?

701
00:57:13,924 --> 00:57:18,303
When you're gone, everything's just
gonna go back to the way it was.

702
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:20,430
I'm not like other kids.

703
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:22,849
I can't even fight for myself.

704
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:25,602
My dad was a hero.

705
00:57:25,644 --> 00:57:27,312
But me?

706
00:57:27,396 --> 00:57:30,607
I'm just different.

707
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,446
Josh, listen to me.

708
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,659
We would never have been able
to find the orb without you.

709
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:43,954
Not everyone would have helped us,
but you did.

710
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:46,498
Because you are different.

711
00:57:47,457 --> 00:57:50,335
I am very lucky to have a friend like you.

712
00:57:50,836 --> 00:57:54,089
- You're just saying that.
- No, I am not.

713
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:57,968
You have helped us greatly.
We are all in great debt to you.

714
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:00,470
I did?

715
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:03,807
Yes. We are saved, Josh.

716
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:19,698
She thinks she's so hot. She's not hot.
Have you seen her butt?

717
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:24,286
- It's like the size of our moon.
- You are so bad.

718
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:27,247
Bad and gorgeous!

719
00:58:32,335 --> 00:58:35,338
Okay, another one. I took the liberty.

720
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:38,091
I love this song.

721
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,599
Need anything, Captain?

722
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:48,852
Yes, I may need
some music references for...

723
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:55,568
Dave, will you do me the honor?

724
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:57,028
Come on!

725
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:58,821
It'll be fun.

726
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:02,200
Yes, yes, I would,
I'd love to dance with you.

727
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:04,243
You're gonna love it!

728
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:10,458
Here, it's really easy.
Just let the music take you.

729
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:13,544
All hands, stay alert,
and obey my commands to the letter.

730
00:59:13,628 --> 00:59:16,422
- Captain, might I have a word?
- Make it brief.

731
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:19,634
There are emotional dangers
on this planet we did not foresee.

732
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:21,928
We are on the brink of anarchy.

733
00:59:21,928 --> 00:59:24,013
Not now.
I'm trying to let the music take me!

734
00:59:24,055 --> 00:59:26,349
All right, crew, everyone,
let's get it together, now!

735
00:59:26,516 --> 00:59:27,975
All together!

736
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:29,769
Precision!

737
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:32,647
Right foot! Left foot!

738
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:41,364
Okay. Here, just follow my lead.

739
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,495
We should be fulfilling our mission,
trying to save our planet,

740
00:59:47,578 --> 00:59:53,584
not leaping around like some sort of idiot,
attempting to woo a gigantic strumpet!

741
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:56,629
This captain has become a joke.

742
00:59:57,672 --> 01:00:01,259
This is over the line, sir.
The Captain still deserves our respect.

743
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:04,303
Shake my hips like this! More hips! Hips!

744
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:07,807
Yes, that's it! More hips!
Look, I'm dancing!

745
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,559
All right, I'm in.

746
01:00:11,978 --> 01:00:13,604
The dancing stops now.

747
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:18,860
Here, here. Hand here. Okay?

748
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:21,779
I need more wiggle in the posterior region!

749
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:24,782
Captain, if I may?

750
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:26,367
You think that you can do better?

751
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,662
Nothing personal, sir,
but that won't be hard.

752
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:31,289
Take charge.

753
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,461
Okay, boys and girls, everybody listen up!

754
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:36,503
You're gonna give me a basic,

755
01:00:36,587 --> 01:00:38,839
stepping forward with the left
and back with the right.

756
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:40,924
Don't bounce, and do not over think it.

757
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:53,270
We're gonna put your accoutrements
right up against her.

758
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:54,730
Drop down.

759
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:01,695
This is salsa, people. Let's make it spicy!

760
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,116
Follow me!

761
01:01:23,217 --> 01:01:25,552
I knew you were holding out on me.

762
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,138
Come on, come on, girl.

763
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:31,558
I'm about to show you
how to do the forbidden dance.

764
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:34,353
It's my birthday!

765
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,398
And dip her, like a cookie in milk.

766
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:39,316
I feel good. I feel loose.

767
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,778
I feel good. I feel loose. I feel good.

768
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:45,906
Hey!

769
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:00,045
Freeze!

770
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:03,132
- Everybody, stay calm.
- Hands up. Hands up!

771
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,635
Should we power up blasters?

772
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,429
No.

773
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:11,223
Too many innocent civilians.

774
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,517
Easy, folks, easy.

775
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:16,563
- Step back, please.
- Dave?

776
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:18,773
Hey, welcome to Earth.

777
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,378
Greetings.

778
01:02:45,216 --> 01:02:47,343
We don't want to hurt you.

779
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:52,098
We don't want to hurt you.

780
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:55,143
We're you're friends.

781
01:02:55,226 --> 01:02:58,980
All we want to know
is why you've come down to our planet.

782
01:02:59,022 --> 01:03:00,482
Oh, for God sake.

783
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:04,277
Stay calm. They can't prove anything.

784
01:03:05,111 --> 01:03:06,488
What is your purpose here?

785
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:09,115
What is your purpose here?

786
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,159
- The mystery is what your purpose here is.
- Okay, you know what?

787
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:13,661
I'm trying to do a thing, and you're not
helping me out, so please stop.

788
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:17,415
Greetings!

789
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,001
No. 2, what are you doing?

790
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:22,796
- You can't do this, Two.
- Excuse me?

791
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:26,424
We're playing
by my rules now, Ex-Captain!

792
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:27,967
Seize him!

793
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:36,017
- You cannot do this, No. 2!
- Can, and will.

794
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:39,646
- You brought this on yourself.
- What are we supposed to do?

795
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,565
You do what you took an oath to do
and protect me, your captain, Four.

796
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:44,984
Stay back, Four.
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

797
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:48,196
You'll never get away with this, Two.
The rest of the crew will not support you!

798
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:51,533
Oh, yes, they will.
Because they have a mission to complete.

799
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:54,077
Three, you're supporting this?

800
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,830
Yes, I see no other way.

801
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:59,125
That's because there is no other way.

802
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,335
Whoa, who left the speaker on?

803
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:02,878
Shut that off!

804
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:11,595
Officer Dooley, can I speak to you outside?
Just for a minute.

805
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:18,728
You will regret this.
Something has been awakened in all of us.

806
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:20,813
Something you will never be able to stop.

807
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:24,900
Looks like I just did.
Confine him to his quarters!

808
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:29,864
Attention, crew! As of this moment,

809
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:33,868
un-Nilian behavior
will no longer be permitted.

810
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:35,786
In fact, it will be punished.

811
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:37,246
Severely.

812
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:40,458
A new era has begun,
with me as your leader.

813
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:42,918
You know,
we just met him a couple days ago,

814
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,795
- like I've said five times.
- Hey.

815
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:46,297
- Hey!
- You guys all right?

816
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,091
Yes. It's been a long night.

817
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:50,342
- What do they want with him?
- I don't know.

818
01:04:50,384 --> 01:04:52,720
He didn't do anything wrong!

819
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:56,891
Stand and engage blasters!

820
01:04:58,017 --> 01:04:59,310
Sir?

821
01:05:00,436 --> 01:05:02,146
I gave you an order.

822
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:03,939
Yes, sir.

823
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:07,151
- Did you not just hear those voices?
- Yes, I heard the voices.

824
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:10,905
Wow, we got a nutjob living
in New York City. What are the odds?

825
01:05:10,988 --> 01:05:12,531
So what are you saying?
We should just let him go?

826
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:14,784
Yes, I think we should let him go!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

827
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:18,829
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my entire life!

828
01:05:19,497 --> 01:05:20,623
Hey!

829
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:25,795
Activate heat shields.

830
01:05:29,423 --> 01:05:31,801
- Freeze!
- Look out!

831
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:37,556
This guy's crazy!
Somebody about to get killed!

832
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:40,268
I'm out! Son of a...

833
01:05:45,857 --> 01:05:47,275
Take cover!

834
01:05:57,786 --> 01:05:59,996
You, woman and child,

835
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,667
you have wasted enough time
with your pathetic emotional distractions.

836
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,210
Dave?

837
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:09,297
Your undisciplined human frailty
causes nothing but chaos!

838
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:11,675
And one other thing,
your so-called artwork

839
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,219
is both pretentious and sophomoric.

840
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:22,269
I could do this all day.

841
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:34,239
Freeze!

842
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:48,378
Three, find me the fastest route
to the landing site.

843
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,005
Three, I...

844
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,675
Guards!

845
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:59,139
No. 12! Have you been working out?

846
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,850
You can tell?

847
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:03,185
No.

848
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:07,939
Yes.

849
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:10,317
- Thank you, Three.
- I didn't do this to help you.

850
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,277
I did this to stop that lunatic!

851
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,616
- What have I done to hurt you so?
- You really can't be that oblivious!

852
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,078
Listen to me. Whatever I have
done to hurt you, I apologize,

853
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,579
but right now we have to
get to the engine room

854
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:24,957
- and shut down the ship!
- Fine! Let's just go.

855
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,251
What in Nil is your problem?

856
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:28,920
Are you all right, Josh?

857
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:32,548
Mom, I'm fine, but something's wrong.
That can't be Dave!

858
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,968
You have to trust me.
We need to go after him.

859
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,595
No, Josh, we're not doing that.

860
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,806
- I know you want to protect me.
- Of course.

861
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,060
But Dave is my friend,
and I need to protect him right now.

862
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,104
- Josh.
- If we don't help him,

863
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,649
something terrible's gonna happen.
I know it!

864
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,111
I was just making conversation to ease
the apparent tension between us.

865
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,406
- Don't. You're making it worse.
- You know what...

866
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,334
No. 3, didn't take you long to betray me.

867
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,086
This is not the answer, Two!

868
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:14,006
You weren't Nilian enough
to do your duty,

869
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,093
- so you left me no choice.
- Listen to reason.

870
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,679
We thought that Earth was not
worth preserving. We were wrong.

871
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,222
There's much we've learned
from this place.

872
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:25,601
- We must not hurt these people!
- Yes, we must!

873
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:32,775
And since you two seem to love
these gargantuan beasts so much,

874
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,986
have fun living among them.

875
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,992
I have a little tickle in my nose.

876
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:04,099
- Follow me!
- No, follow me!

877
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,688
Three, I'm so sorry
that you're out here with me.

878
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:11,482
Not half as sorry as I am!

879
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:15,110
Please, we'll have the entire
journey back home to argue.

880
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,531
- This may not be the best spot, sir.
- And why not?

881
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,369
Mother of Nil!

882
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:38,550
Three!

883
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,766
- I'm coming, Three. Don't move.
- Great advice, Captain.

884
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:47,684
Because I can't!

885
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,069
- Are you all right, Three?
- Please! You have no concern for me.

886
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,488
All you care about is Gina,
your big, fat girlfriend!

887
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,531
You think that she's fat?

888
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,408
If she wears a size infinity,

889
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,036
then she's fat!

890
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,751
It takes me almost getting run over
for you to even notice me!

891
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:15,295
I'm practically invisible to you!

892
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:19,883
Invisible? Quite the opposite.
When I look at you, what I see is

893
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,218
the ship!

894
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,392
I love New York. Let's go!

895
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,275
Trust me, Three. Jump!

896
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:45,326
It's working!

897
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,670
You see? Just as I planned!

898
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:10,310
Look, if we let go
at precisely the right moment,

899
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:11,936
we'll be propelled to the ship.

900
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,064
On three.

901
01:11:14,814 --> 01:11:20,445
One, two, three!

902
01:11:26,826 --> 01:11:28,119
Three.

903
01:11:29,496 --> 01:11:33,166
I asked for you
to be assigned to this mission

904
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:37,670
because you are kind,
intelligent and beautiful,

905
01:11:37,754 --> 01:11:40,882
more so than anyone
I've ever known in my life.

906
01:11:41,466 --> 01:11:43,259
And without you,

907
01:11:44,886 --> 01:11:46,679
I would be nothing.

908
01:11:48,848 --> 01:11:51,935
Why have you never
spoken to me of this before?

909
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,438
Because I was too Nilian to express it.

910
01:11:56,398 --> 01:11:59,901
I should have lassoed the moon
for you long ago.

911
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,836
But now let's turn the ship around.

912
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:29,265
We'll never get there at this rate.
Give me full power to the legs!

913
01:12:29,348 --> 01:12:33,519
I told you. Our power is nearly depleted.

914
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:40,192
Crew, prepare to hail a cab!

915
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:43,779
Taxi!

916
01:12:49,702 --> 01:12:52,705
What? An alien cannot
get a cab in this town?

917
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:02,089
Hey, buddy! This is my cab!
What are you doing?

918
01:13:03,132 --> 01:13:06,761
Liberty Island Ferry. Make haste or die.

919
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:12,725
Yes, every available cop in the city,
and the Feds.

920
01:13:12,808 --> 01:13:17,146
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it!
I knew we were not alone in this universe.

921
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:20,816
- Look, I'm not convinced he's an alien.
- Oh, you're not?

922
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:25,529
- So what?
- So what? So, who you calling?

923
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,323
- Homeland Security.
- Don't do that.

924
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:29,617
They're gonna overreact!
We don't even know why he's visiting yet.

925
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:32,369
Well, it's obviously not a peace mission!

926
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:34,872
Get those big slobbery lips away from me!

927
01:13:34,955 --> 01:13:36,957
And while you suckers
are sitting here talking,

928
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,001
he about to go suck your planet dry!

929
01:13:39,043 --> 01:13:41,420
I need somebody
from Homeland Security, please.

930
01:13:41,462 --> 01:13:43,339
I don't have the extension.

931
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:44,840
- Are you with Dave?
- No.

932
01:13:44,924 --> 01:13:47,635
No, no. I come free with a venti latte.

933
01:13:47,676 --> 01:13:49,303
Of course I'm with Dave, stupid!

934
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:52,348
- I need... Hey, you got a comment?
- No.

935
01:13:53,933 --> 01:13:57,103
I need the extension from you guys
because I don't have it.

936
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,689
- Do you know where he went?
- Yes, I do.

937
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:02,650
I need a ride, though.

938
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:05,946
- Okay.
- Well, what you waiting for?

939
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:07,406
Okay.

940
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,283
Wait, wait, wait.

941
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:13,286
Don't be shaking me.

942
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:15,163
Sorry. I apologize.

943
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:17,999
Don't be blowing on me!
I don't know you that well!

944
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,794
Slow down. Slow. Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, I said slow down now!

945
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:22,379
Wait, it's dark in here. I'm in.

946
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,924
Please, hurry. Dooley, where you going?

947
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,718
Hey, Sarge, you got
a little schmutz right here.

948
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,094
Shut up!

949
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:36,476
- How many tickets you got?
- I've never been caught speeding.

950
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:38,270
In New York.

951
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,688
This year.

952
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:47,821
Long live Nil.

953
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:52,534
Sorry, Earth. Sometimes No. 2 happens!

954
01:14:54,327 --> 01:14:56,163
Captain! Thank goodness you're back.

955
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:57,873
No. 2's become a raging lunatic.

956
01:14:57,956 --> 01:15:01,460
Not to worry, kind friend.
I'm back, and I'm taking over.

957
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:06,131
Welcome, Captain.

958
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:21,229
Right Arm!

959
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:24,816
- What the devil is this?
- Someone's overriding the system!

960
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,736
Only the Captain has the code to...

961
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,614
The Captain!

962
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:57,767
You are in my chair!

963
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:01,854
Guards!

964
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:05,024
- Put down your weapons.
- Seize him!

965
01:16:05,108 --> 01:16:09,737
Guards, I said seize him!
You've seen what a fool he's been!

966
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:15,618
We all know I am the only one
qualified to get us home.

967
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,873
Is this what you want? This chaos?

968
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:26,629
We choose our Captain.

969
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:30,925
This planet rocks. Deal with it.

970
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:37,724
Get out of my chair.

971
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:44,689
Captain, the orb is in the water.

972
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:48,359
The siphoning process
is getting stronger by the minute.

973
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:55,700
Right Arm, summon the orb.

974
01:16:55,742 --> 01:16:59,871
Captain, the fight
drained our power below 1 %.

975
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:04,667
I can re-route booster energy,
but there won't be enough for take-off.

976
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:10,506
Well, Captain, it seems you have a choice.

977
01:17:11,299 --> 01:17:14,594
Save this planet or save yourself.

978
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:17,972
I choose this planet.

979
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:21,642
And what of your beloved crew?

980
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:25,021
Are you willing
to condemn them to the same fate?

981
01:17:25,064 --> 01:17:28,567
Stranded here in a world of behemoths?

982
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:32,863
I believe it is the right thing to do,

983
01:17:32,905 --> 01:17:36,075
but I cannot
make this decision for all of you.

984
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:40,079
I say we save Earth.

985
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:41,705
And its moon.

986
01:17:43,874 --> 01:17:46,543
My life began on this planet.

987
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:48,837
I no longer feel like No. 3.

988
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:55,052
I am Dave Ming Chang.

989
01:17:55,094 --> 01:17:58,639
I have 443 new friends on MySpace

990
01:17:58,722 --> 01:18:03,143
and a JDate next week
with a woman named Sheila Moskowitz.

991
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:07,272
I am Dave Ming Chang.

992
01:18:08,065 --> 01:18:10,067
I am Dave Ming Chang.

993
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:14,238
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

994
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:17,950
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

995
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:22,287
I am Johnny Dazzles, and I am fabulous!

996
01:18:23,956 --> 01:18:27,418
What? Not everybody
has to be Dave Ming Chang.

997
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,922
You've all gone completely mad!

998
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:34,591
Take him and put him

999
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:36,260
in my butt.

1000
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:46,061
Engineer, divert all remaining power
to Right Arm.

1001
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,865
- Way to go, Right Arm!
- Yes!

1002
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,166
Dave! Are you okay?

1003
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:52,337
Dave! What is happening?
How can we help you?

1004
01:19:52,378 --> 01:19:55,215
Thank you, but it is too late.

1005
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,175
We are out of power.

1006
01:19:57,258 --> 01:20:00,970
We'll never get back now. It is over.

1007
01:20:01,054 --> 01:20:04,849
Hands behind your head! Understand?
Step away from that thing!

1008
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,268
- No!
- Hey! Let us handle this, folks, okay?

1009
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:09,312
You don't need your guns, all right?
Don't hurt him!

1010
01:20:09,396 --> 01:20:10,939
We're not gonna hurt anybody.

1011
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:12,982
- We're just gonna talk.
- Dooley, enough!

1012
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:15,860
You've seen what that thing can do.
Hands behind your head!

1013
01:20:15,902 --> 01:20:18,696
Captain, with no shield and no power,

1014
01:20:18,738 --> 01:20:22,033
the projectile from his weapon
will breach the hull.

1015
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,785
We'll take casualties.

1016
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,495
He can't move!
He doesn't have any power left!

1017
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:27,956
- Hands behind your head!
- He can't move!

1018
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:29,124
- Josh!
- Kid!

1019
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:30,625
Josh!

1020
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:42,470
We have power. We have been saved.

1021
01:20:42,512 --> 01:20:44,305
All hail Josh the hero!

1022
01:20:49,854 --> 01:20:52,022
Stay right where you are!

1023
01:20:55,735 --> 01:20:59,572
Yeah, if you're trying to freak me out,
it's not gonna work.

1024
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:05,244
All right, that's gonna freak me out a little.
Do you see that?

1025
01:21:05,286 --> 01:21:07,580
- I do.
- Is that a guy?

1026
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:09,165
- Looks like it.
- Like a really little guy?

1027
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,083
- Like a really little guy.
- On his tongue?

1028
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,252
What'd I just say?

1029
01:21:13,377 --> 01:21:15,713
- Hello.
- You, you see that, right?

1030
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:18,591
- There's a little guy in there?
- He's talking.

1031
01:21:18,632 --> 01:21:21,052
- Yeah.
- Dave.

1032
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:24,764
I apologize to all of you.

1033
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:28,434
It was my second-in-command
who took control of my ship by force,

1034
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:31,395
and it was he, not I, who performed
these unspeakable acts of cruelty.

1035
01:21:31,437 --> 01:21:33,105
Will you put that thing down?
Would you please?

1036
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:37,443
I mean, the guy's an inch tall.
You look like a wuss. Right?

1037
01:21:37,485 --> 01:21:41,572
Josh, my friend.
You helped save two worlds today.

1038
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:46,410
And you taught me the true meaning
of friendship and courage.

1039
01:21:47,244 --> 01:21:50,164
Your father would have been proud
of his young captain.

1040
01:21:50,164 --> 01:21:53,292
Promise me you'll always take pride
in being different.

1041
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:56,170
- I promise.
- High-five.

1042
01:21:58,422 --> 01:22:01,008
Perhaps that's not such a great idea.

1043
01:22:05,429 --> 01:22:08,474
- Gina.
- Yeah. Yeah, hi.

1044
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,810
You're, you're really tiny.

1045
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,311
And I should have known
you were an alien,

1046
01:22:12,436 --> 01:22:14,397
because no straight man
is that good a dancer.

1047
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:19,318
I think I'm finally able to understand
how your painting makes me feel.

1048
01:22:21,987 --> 01:22:23,489
I feel love.

1049
01:22:27,869 --> 01:22:31,623
- Okay, I guess she's not that fat.
- Told you.

1050
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:37,045
Hey! Hey, man!
Hey, don't forget about me!

1051
01:22:37,838 --> 01:22:40,424
Yeah! I'm not trying to stay in here!

1052
01:22:41,758 --> 01:22:43,218
You squeezing my brain!

1053
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,555
- You're gonna make it pop! Stop!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1054
01:22:46,638 --> 01:22:48,682
Hey, slow down.
I don't want you messing up my sexy.

1055
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:52,185
Okay. Easy.
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

1056
01:22:52,853 --> 01:22:53,895
Okay.

1057
01:22:58,066 --> 01:23:02,070
Hey! Yeah. Yeah, that, that look good.

1058
01:23:04,698 --> 01:23:06,700
Time for us to go home.

1059
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,871
- I'll miss you, Dave.
- And I you.

1060
01:23:11,663 --> 01:23:15,167
Remember, I'll never be that far away,

1061
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:18,420
good friend.

1062
01:23:29,222 --> 01:23:31,099
A little room, please.

1063
01:23:51,328 --> 01:23:52,704
What? No!

1064
01:23:59,544 --> 01:24:00,837
Dave!

1065
01:24:08,513 --> 01:24:10,264
- FBI!
- Out of the way!

1066
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:11,933
Move, move, move!

1067
01:24:11,974 --> 01:24:14,185
- No!
- Hey, what is going on?

1068
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:30,910
Mom, look!

1069
01:24:36,624 --> 01:24:38,084
He's okay.

1070
01:24:54,809 --> 01:24:56,602
I didn't think we'd make it out of there.

1071
01:24:56,686 --> 01:24:59,480
Good thing you have
such big feet, Captain.

1072
01:25:00,606 --> 01:25:03,067
We'll have much to explain
when we return home.

1073
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:05,737
We'll find another way to save Nil.

1074
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,822
There are plenty of worlds out there
for us to explore.

1075
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:09,574
Yes, No. 3.

1076
01:25:09,657 --> 01:25:10,908
But what we learned on Earth

1077
01:25:10,992 --> 01:25:13,953
is more valuable
than all the salt in the galaxy.

1078
01:25:14,036 --> 01:25:18,416
And when we do return,
it looks like I'll be needing a new No. 2.

1079
01:25:18,499 --> 01:25:21,335
I think you'll be needing more than that.

1080
01:25:25,465 --> 01:25:28,342
Yeah, Captain!
Get in there, Captain!

1081
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:50,948
Cue the new anthem.
