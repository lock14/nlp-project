1
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,332
The NTSB guys are here about
that bulkhead problem.

2
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,697
OK, thanks.

3
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,210
It's there.

4
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,953
I should run the algorithms,
though, don't you think?

5
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,019
Nope.

6
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,497
You wanna wait for those
spectrometer results?

7
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,692
No.

8
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,382
Hi.

9
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,416
Hey.

10
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,229
What about dinner, tonight?

11
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,703
Ha. We go out to dinner..

12
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,535
we might never come back.

13
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,562
OK.

14
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,835
Hee hee!

15
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,076
I wanna wake up with you..

16
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,775
Mrs. Smith.

17
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,345
I want to at least
see where you live.

18
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,091
I live here..

19
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,028
Mr. Smith.

20
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,384
Metro division.

21
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,159
Uh, Lieutenant Nunally, please.

22
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,031
Uh, Lieutenant Nunally
comes on at 6:00 tonight.

23
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,092
Can someone else help you?

24
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,262
No, that's OK, I'll
see him later.

25
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,293
Thank you.

26
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,090
Whoa!

27
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,492
Ha!

28
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,667
Hey.

29
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,034
Afternoon, Ciro.

30
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,670
- Hello there.
- Ahh.

31
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,467
You're home early.

32
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,810
Yeah.

33
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,544
I just felt, um..

34
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,986
a sudden urge.

35
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,353
Are you OK?

36
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,484
Ah.. Yeah.

37
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,996
I could use a hug.

38
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,019
Hmm.

39
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,835
You know, I've been
watching you sleep..

40
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,167
at night.

41
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,202
That's creepy.

42
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,176
Huh. Yeah.

43
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,644
Yeah, sometimes
when I'm at work..

44
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,112
I'll start thinking about you..

45
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,637
and I'll just get..

46
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,276
Ahh, just overwhelmed.

47
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,410
Ted..

48
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,680
It's a dense, crushing..

49
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,848
geophysical force, like
I'm pinned to the core..

50
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,222
while things change, you know?

51
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,921
Do you ever get that
way about me, Jen?

52
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,592
I really don't think I can
do one of these tonight.

53
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,895
I'm just.. huh..

54
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,732
trying to describe my feelings.

55
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,260
Those don't sound like feelings.

56
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,239
Oh.

57
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,265
What's the sound of a feeling?

58
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,137
You think you're so
much smarter than me.

59
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,547
Must make you feel
very powerful.

60
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,449
Helpless, actually.

61
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,747
OK, maybe it's time
to really talk.

62
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,778
No.

63
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,586
- No?
- No.

64
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,751
Fine.

65
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,782
Whatever.

66
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,260
Huh.

67
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,126
I'll go change. I'll
make some dinner.

68
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,934
I love you.

69
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,798
I know.

70
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,378
Does he..

71
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,473
Mrs. Smith?

72
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,976
I'm sorry.

73
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,285
Don't be.

74
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,790
Knowledge is pain.

75
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,452
I'm used to that.

76
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,656
Not that I don't get
some little pleasures..

77
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,425
in return for the
pain, mind you.

78
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,028
Mr. And Mrs. Crawford?

79
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,059
You all right?

80
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,540
Everybody OK in there?

81
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,013
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?

82
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,287
Did you see anything unusual?

83
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,315
Mr. And Mrs. Crawford.

84
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,725
Nobody else?

85
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,786
No. No.

86
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,830
Flores, how you been?

87
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,858
Good, good, you know, same.

88
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,166
We've got one witness,
maybe, uh, the gardener.

89
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,262
His name's Ciro.

90
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,773
Hey, guys, this is
Lieutenant Nunally.

91
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,797
Good to meet you.

92
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,831
Hello, sir.

93
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,071
So what do we know?

94
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,512
Mr. Crawford?

95
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,750
Who is this?

96
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,418
My name is Lieutenant
Robert Nunally.

97
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,256
I'm a hostage negotiator
with the L.A.P.D.

98
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,953
Mr. Crawford?

99
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,835
OK.

100
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,003
You two, let's go.

101
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,949
Just you, please.

102
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,431
Mr. Crawford?

103
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm just gonna..

104
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,199
slide the door open
just a bit, all right?

105
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,335
Hi.

106
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,143
Hi.

107
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,174
Do I call you Rob?

108
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,320
Sure, yeah. If you want to.

109
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,888
Lots of vampires out there.

110
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,028
Mr. Crawford..

111
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,428
what do you say you
gimme the gun?

112
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,489
That way I can pay more attention
to what you're saying.

113
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,522
All right?

114
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,860
Is that your best shot.. Rob?

115
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,931
So to speak.

116
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,772
Tell you what. I
will if you will.

117
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,440
We both put down our guns.

118
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:46,212
We set them down
and we step away.

119
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,812
Then you can pay attention
to what I'm saying.

120
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,551
All right, I'm gonna
have to ask you..

121
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,286
to put yours down first, then.

122
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,588
Then you have my word.

123
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,754
Everybody gives a little..

124
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,887
we'll see what we can do..

125
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,727
about getting you
what you want, OK?

126
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,460
Happy ending, then.

127
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,747
So Mr. Crawford, your gardener
tells it that..that your wife..

128
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,306
It's Ted.

129
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,715
I'm sorry.

130
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,448
You can call me Ted.

131
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,786
Ted. Great.

132
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,812
Ted.

133
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,151
Your wife, is she here?

134
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,764
Is she all right?

135
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,498
I don't think she is.

136
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,800
I shot her.

137
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,271
You shot your wife.

138
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,903
It's just like I
suddenly snapped..

139
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,712
and I got the gun and I
shot her in the head.

140
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,080
I know it was wrong.

141
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,926
Are you listening to me, Rob?

142
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,494
Uh.. Jesus Christ.

143
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,494
You know, I read somewhere
that the best place..

144
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,969
to find a pulse is in
the femoral artery.

145
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,598
It's on the inner surface
of the upper thigh.

146
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,403
So if you just, uh,
put your fingers..

147
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,466
up her skirt..

148
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,477
you'll find it.

149
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,008
Go! Go!

150
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,676
Break it up!

151
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,881
We got a victim down!

152
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,328
She's got a pulse.

153
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,000
Rob.

154
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,510
Good job.

155
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,738
You all right?

156
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,064
I wanna be in the room.

157
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,589
Well, we got it covered.

158
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,433
Yeah, I know.

159
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,929
I just wanna be there.

160
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,506
And I want this thing locked..

161
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,604
before we pass it to the D.A.

162
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,769
Stop yelling, Phil.

163
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,432
I called you as a courtesy..

164
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,963
and now you're trying
to take advantage.

165
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,805
I'm not.

166
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm not knocking it
down to a class C.

167
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,010
My backlog of open cases
doesn't mitigate the fact..

168
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,845
that your client tried to
kill his brother-in-law.

169
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,652
A golfing accident.

170
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,849
Phil, your client
owns one golf club..

171
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,187
no golf balls..

172
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,021
and the accident happened
in a stairwell..

173
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,018
of an after-hours,
illegal gambling hall.

174
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,661
Uhh. I'll see you in court.

175
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,004
Well, I won't. Someone
from this office will.

176
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,528
You can take it up with them.

177
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,536
Beachum.

178
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,145
Hello.

179
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,673
Ahem.

180
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,413
No, I didn't.

181
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,545
Yeah.

182
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,522
Wooton Sims?

183
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,581
Shh.

184
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,921
Wooton Sims?

185
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,119
Shut up.

186
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,650
Short notice is fine.

187
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,663
It's fine. Uh-huh.

188
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,097
Black tie? Fine.

189
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,191
What time?

190
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,258
That'll be fine.

191
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,792
Thank her for me.

192
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,064
All right.

193
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,832
How many times did
I just say fine?

194
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,502
You asshole!

195
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,034
How the hell did you get
a job at Wooton Sims?

196
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,376
I can't even get an interview!

197
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,472
We're gonna just pretend
he's not talking.

198
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,504
I've been here
five years, Willy.

199
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,538
I'm your supervisor.

200
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,211
I graduated USC, summa.

201
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,186
- I need a tuxedo.
- A tux?

202
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,518
You are so full of shit.

203
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,318
A tuxedo tonight.
Is that possible?

204
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,346
Of course.

205
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,380
- They do that?
- Uh-huh.

206
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,723
- Same day sort of thing?
- Sure.

207
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,954
- Can I give you that?
- Yeah.

208
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,053
OK.

209
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,222
Well, that's maxed out..

210
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,561
so I'm gonna give
you this, then.

211
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,499
So, um, what's this all about?

212
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,331
Well, you know, Burt
Wooton's having..

213
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,734
a charity opera thing, and, uh..

214
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,862
Burt?

215
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,395
Well, that's what he
told me to call him.

216
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,533
You're gonna need to
pick out a style, Willy.

217
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,304
- Well, like what?
- Willy Beachum's office.

218
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,402
Thinking maybe, uh..

219
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,571
- Classic.
- Classic.

220
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,602
Yeah, no problem.

221
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,909
- Classic.
- Uh-huh.

222
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,939
Just makes sure it comes with
cuff links and knee pads.

223
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:52,973
- Willy.
- Ahh.

224
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,007
That's not classic.

225
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,041
That's what I'm saying.

226
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,076
Before. After.

227
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,088
That's the way I go.

228
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,953
God wants to see you.

229
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,414
Our god?

230
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,190
Who art on the fourth floor.

231
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,788
Mr. Lobruto?

232
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,892
Mr. Beachum.

233
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,435
Have a seat.

234
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,461
Thank you.

235
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,472
William "no middle
initial" Beachum.

236
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,745
Wow, a 97% conviction rate.

237
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,114
That's impressive.

238
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,778
Thank you, sir.

239
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:32,449
'Course, you traded all your
losing cases to other D.D.A.s.

240
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,085
Well, uh..

241
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,563
I took on two or three cases
for every one I gave away.

242
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,724
They just couldn't
handle their caseloads..

243
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,131
and I don't like to lose.

244
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,000
Uh, you won't always win
working at Wooton Sims.

245
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,129
Ahem.

246
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,298
Working at Wooton Sims
sort of is winning.

247
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,807
Isn't it?

248
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,832
Well, you'll need
a middle initial.

249
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,342
Sir?

250
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,847
Well, those guys all play
squash and have middle names.

251
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,645
Ahh. Huh.

252
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,379
They go in for their
mother's maiden name a lot.

253
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,479
Well, my mother doesn't
have a maiden name.

254
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,548
I think you belong
here, William.

255
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,653
Well, with all due
respect, sir..

256
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,129
I just didn't work this hard
to stay where I belong.

257
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,367
Yeah, well.. I didn't think so.

258
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,934
Well, you have your
litigation experience..

259
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,372
your chops..

260
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,671
and your, uh, juicy
private sector job.

261
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,307
Pretty soon you'll be
courtside at Laker games.

262
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,840
Anything else the city of
Los Angeles can do for ya?

263
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,647
No, sir. I think that'll be all.

264
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,675
Yeah.

265
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,212
It's a cummerbund, Willy.

266
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,419
Huh. That's gonna go
around your waist, OK?

267
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,484
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

268
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,516
- Are we good?
- Uh-huh.

269
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,586
- Good.
- All right.

270
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,559
Willy?

271
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,971
Willy, come on.
Pick up the phone.

272
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,871
Uh..

273
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,432
What, Norman?

274
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,705
Got an attempted homicide.

275
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,838
Guy shot his wife,
she's in a coma.

276
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,816
Arraignment's at 3:00
with Judge Moran.

277
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,250
3:00 is in 15 minutes.

278
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,550
You do still actually
work here, Willy. Right?

279
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,557
Norman, would you just find
somebody else to do it?

280
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,855
Everybody's booked. Look,
it's not going to trial.

281
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,520
There's a weapon with prints..

282
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,188
and a signed confession.

283
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,131
Just take the arraignment,
wait for the plea.

284
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,996
It's a real confession?

285
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,560
Spontaneous and signed.

286
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,072
Come on, Willy.

287
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,473
All right, but, uh..

288
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,499
here's the problem.

289
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,646
OK, that'll do! I've
given my ruling.

290
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,739
If they want to squabble,
they can take it outside.

291
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,114
I apologize, Your Honor.

292
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,379
Your Honor, please. Your Honor.

293
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,421
Mr. Beachum.

294
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,433
Nice to see a man who
dresses for court.

295
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,833
I'm very sorry, Your Honor.

296
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,461
Very sorry.

297
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,438
It's a long story.

298
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,600
The people of the
state of California..

299
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,667
versus Theodore Crawford.

300
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,611
Your Honor, the public
defender is representing..

301
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,842
Mr. Crawford for
his arraignment..

302
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,248
with the understanding
that he will secure..

303
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,480
private counsel for all
further proceedings.

304
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,681
Mr. Crawford, you
have been charged..

305
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,748
with section 664 slash 187..

306
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,454
of the California penal
code: Attempted murder.

307
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,157
Do you waive further
reading of the complaint..

308
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,665
and complete
statement of rights?

309
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,893
You do.

310
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:29,992
I do. But, I.. I want..

311
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,196
And do you wish to enter
a plea at this time?

312
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,295
Yes, not guilty.

313
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,327
But I also want to
waive my right..

314
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,567
to a counsel and
represent myself.

315
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,667
Surely you won't have
trouble finding..

316
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,541
an attorney, Mr. Crawford?

317
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,103
No, but I want to do it myself.

318
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,012
Your Honor, if I can have
a moment with my client.

319
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,141
I'm not your client.

320
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,309
Try and keep up, will you?

321
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,012
Uh, Mr. Crawford, uh..

322
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,521
you're facing some very
serious charges here.

323
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,785
I strongly urge you
to retain counsel.

324
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,813
That's very kind..

325
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,554
but I believe I'm
within my rights.

326
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,459
Be aware that lack of counsel..

327
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,020
will not be grounds
for an appeal.

328
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,157
Oh, I understand. I understand.

329
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,690
People have an
objection, Mr. Beachum?

330
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,997
Well, Your Honor..

331
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,835
we have a..

332
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,535
a verbal and signed confession.

333
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,637
So, I would strongly advise..

334
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,239
Mr. Crawford to, uh..

335
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,881
to get a competent attorney
to try and negotiate a plea.

336
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,548
That's pretty damning
evidence, Mr. Crawford.

337
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,681
You wanna reconsider?

338
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,123
Absolutely not.

339
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,989
Huh. It's gonna
turn into a circus.

340
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,255
I appreciate your concern..

341
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,024
for the dignity of
the court, 007.

342
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,294
Unfortunately, the man is
a tax-paying citizen..

343
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,800
and entitled by our
constitution..

344
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,598
to try and manipulate
the legal system..

345
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,797
like everybody else.

346
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,068
Mr. Crawford wants
to go pro per..

347
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,600
that's gonna take a
while, and sadly..

348
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,202
I won't be here for it.

349
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,543
But the people
have no objection.

350
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,209
Your Honor, I'd,
uh, like to, um..

351
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,184
waive my right to
preliminary hearing..

352
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,914
and go direct to trial
as soon as possible.

353
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,445
Uh, does that help
you, Mr., uh, Beachum?

354
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,548
Y.. You don't have to worry..

355
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,819
about Mr. Beachum, Mr. Crawford.

356
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,349
The district attorney's office..

357
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,861
will assign another prosecutor.

358
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,123
No, I like Mr. Beachum.

359
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,223
Mr. Beachum.

360
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,568
He likes you.

361
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,460
Yes.

362
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,201
That's terrific.

363
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,004
Appears Mr. Crawford
has an understanding..

364
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,239
of his rights and
responsibilities, so..

365
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,474
it's your call, Mr. Beachum.

366
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,583
Why not?

367
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,320
All right, then.

368
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,794
Case will move to trial at
the first available date.

369
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,661
Beachum.

370
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,808
You're supposed to be good.

371
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,481
Is that right?

372
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,951
Who the hell are you?

373
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,616
I'm, uh, Lieutenant Nunally.

374
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,955
I took Crawford's confession.

375
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,324
Oh.

376
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,656
Shoo. OK.

377
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,859
So, what can I do for ya?

378
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,831
Are you gonna be
on this, or what?

379
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,338
'Cause it looks to me like..

380
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,002
you got one foot out
the door already.

381
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,174
Oh.

382
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,808
Huh.

383
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,148
You should be taking
this seriously.

384
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,312
You know, be careful with this guy.
He's.. he's..

385
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,651
There's something not
right about him.

386
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,217
Y.. Y.. You took the
confession, right?

387
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,084
You took the gun
out of his hand.

388
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,118
Yeah.

389
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,687
Great. So it's done.

390
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,898
Don't worry about it.

391
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,516
Can I have a bourbon?

392
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,249
Yes, sir.

393
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,586
Thank you.

394
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,751
Are you a shark?

395
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,693
Excuse me?

396
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,359
You've been circling
this lobby..

397
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,027
for half an hour now..

398
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,037
like if you'd
stopped, you'd die.

399
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,299
Oh. Yeah..

400
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,430
I'm a shark.

401
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,408
What about you? Are
you a shark, too?

402
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,113
You say hi to Burt?

403
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,512
Oh.

404
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,517
Burt's talking to the mayor.

405
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,984
Do I know you?

406
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,115
Nikki Gardner. Your new boss.

407
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,817
Oh.

408
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,052
Ha.

409
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,583
You're the one who sent
me the invitation?

410
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,889
Well, I thought I ought
to get to know..

411
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,592
the mystery man that Burt
plucked outta nowhere.

412
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,399
Well, I don't really know Burt.

413
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,139
So, every partner has a
team of senior associates.

414
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,516
Every senior associate has a
team of junior associates.

415
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,750
And you're on my team, which
means I'll supervise..

416
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,257
your casework and
I'll steer you..

417
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,088
through the office politics.

418
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,152
Kinda like a mentor.

419
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,561
Kinda like a probation officer.

420
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,863
Oh, you trying.. you're
trying to scare me?

421
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,098
Let me ask you a question.

422
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,605
OK.

423
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,106
Shoot.

424
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,768
We have a senior associate..

425
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,606
at the firm named Calvin Tyler.

426
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,078
Kind of a rising star.

427
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,842
He goes into court against you.

428
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,440
Some client's kid is D.U. I..

429
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,781
And the next thing we know,
Calvin is fired and..

430
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,151
Burt Wooton, who has
never even interviewed..

431
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,748
a junior associate before,
let alone hired one..

432
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,816
says you're starting
in two weeks.

433
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,288
Calvin came to me for a deal.

434
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,265
So I told him if he can
get me a meeting..

435
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,995
with Mr. Wooton, that I'd..

436
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,331
throw the case.

437
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,535
He set it up, but he came
to court unprepared..

438
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,907
and I mopped the floor with him.

439
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,276
Your client got the
maximum, and then..

440
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,873
next day, I was meeting
with Mr. Wooton.

441
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,747
Bo.. Burt.

442
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,154
That's..

443
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,886
You didn't actually do
anything all that wrong.

444
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,053
I wasn't exactly
honest with Calvin.

445
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,083
Ha.

446
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,533
Are you gonna get that?

447
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,639
Everybody I wanna talk
to is right here.

448
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,839
Welcome to Wooton Sims.

449
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,006
Get your phone.

450
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,010
Yeah.

451
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,044
Hey, Willy, it's Flores.
I got bad news.

452
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,181
The gun. It's no good.

453
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,556
What do you mean
the gun's no good?

454
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,584
Well, it's a fine gun.

455
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,892
It's just no good as evidence.

456
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,954
Never been fired.

457
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,397
Never been fired?

458
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,867
Well, it's the gun from
the house, isn't it?

459
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,426
Yeah. It's, uh..

460
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,028
property of the defendant..

461
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,872
bought about.. one month ago.

462
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,934
Well, the gun never
left the house.

463
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,469
He was locked inside from
the time of the crime..

464
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,845
to the time of the arrest.

465
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,545
So the gun is in there.

466
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,110
So don't tell me that
the gun isn't in there.

467
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,382
Go find it.

468
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,413
Get a team out there
tomorrow and find it.

469
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,443
No, I haven't.

470
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,785
I have not.

471
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,916
Well, everything's been
so expedited, you know.

472
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,427
And I guess I just
thought that, uh..

473
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,452
Well, I don't know.
I guess I thought..

474
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,862
however it was decorated
was how it was decorated.

475
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,457
Huh?

476
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,626
Right away, sir.

477
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,965
Well, what do most..

478
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,834
of the other junior
associates have?

479
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,670
Oh.

480
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,835
Well, what..

481
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,810
What is the difference
between, uh..

482
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,507
Italian and English?

483
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,308
Yeah, I kno..

484
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,819
I know that they are two
different countries.

485
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,980
I was talking about in
terms of interior design.

486
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,149
You hold on one second?

487
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,988
Huh.

488
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,189
What, uh, kind of style
would you say that this is?

489
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,696
Homicidal modern?

490
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,361
I don't know.

491
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,768
I guess I'll just know
it when I see it.

492
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,032
Uh-huh.

493
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,937
Ooh, 2:00? I don't..

494
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,836
Yeah, all right. I can do it.

495
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,973
Bye-bye, now.

496
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,176
Alright, good to see you.

497
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,484
What the hell is this?

498
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,420
It's a.. thing.

499
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,888
It does stuff.

500
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,084
What, did he make
it or something?

501
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,151
- The guy? Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

502
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,218
Here, take a look at this.

503
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,196
It's for the Glock 45..

504
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,425
we found at the scene.

505
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,663
Now, we got no other
sign of a gun so far.

506
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,034
No weapon.

507
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,971
No powder on his hand..

508
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,530
no blood on his clothes.

509
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,871
We found four shell casings.

510
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,604
45's wiped clean. No prints.

511
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,339
That's four shots fired.

512
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,643
Four bullets missing
from the case.

513
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,149
Four shell casings on the
floor with no prints on 'em.

514
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,051
And a gun that's
never been fired.

515
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,180
The guy's screwing with us.

516
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,087
He's stacking the deck.

517
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,092
She's pretty.

518
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,961
Look, the gun is in this house.

519
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,629
Maybe he was wearing gloves.

520
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,332
Maybe he had time to change.

521
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,567
But it's in the house..

522
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,097
and I'll tell you why
it's in the house.

523
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,133
Because people were
watching the house.

524
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,805
And he never came out.

525
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,108
And I could be wrong..

526
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,082
but I don't think that the
gun grew little gun legs..

527
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,846
and ran out of the house.

528
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,376
So, if you need more guys..

529
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,321
I'm all for it.

530
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,101
That's disability insurance.

531
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,936
- Uh-huh.
- Most of our employees get that.

532
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,601
It's only an additional
$6.84 a month.

533
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,836
All right.

534
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,777
Just be sure you sign the one
with the devil in blood.

535
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,507
It's not binding otherwise.

536
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,910
Just going into a meeting.

537
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,110
I wanted to stop
by and make sure..

538
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,641
you're getting
everything you need.

539
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,154
I'm getting more than I need.

540
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,793
I'm running a little late.
Will you walk with me?

541
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,124
Yeah.

542
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,459
I'll send him right back.

543
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,486
Oh, no problem.

544
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,520
We were just finishing
paperwork..

545
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,657
and ordering furniture..

546
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,133
and I was gonna give him
some swatches and chips.

547
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,294
Which I thought was
something to eat..

548
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,428
- didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

549
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,960
- He he.
- Ha ha ha.

550
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,472
All right.

551
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,496
I like that.

552
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,701
- Oh, I like that one, too.
- Yeah.

553
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,800
No purple.

554
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,970
Let me handle it.

555
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,707
"More than I need," huh?

556
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,944
Oh, I was just talking
about the furniture.

557
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,144
Well, don't get too attached.

558
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,174
You're not gonna be here much.

559
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,811
Two weeks from Tuesday..

560
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,719
whole team's getting
on a plane to Chicago.

561
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,656
Why, what's going on in Chicago?

562
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,885
Warfield.

563
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,322
Warfield?

564
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,091
Ain't that the biotech
guy who stole like, uh..

565
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,961
300 million from
his own company?

566
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,763
That biotech guy who had
no idea whatsoever..

567
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,792
what his CFO was doing?

568
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,532
Oh, right.

569
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,106
This is a test, Willy.

570
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,975
Burt told me to give
you a trial by fire.

571
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,776
I'm good at trials by fire.

572
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,543
He wants you up to speed..

573
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,642
on eight months of
depositions in two weeks.

574
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,674
No problem.

575
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,688
What about closing
out your old job?

576
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,053
Don't worry about it.

577
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,199
- Yeah?
- Beachum.

578
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,870
No, Danny, no.

579
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,538
No, no, no, no. L.. no.

580
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,548
The idea is to get
things outta here.

581
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,880
Oh, is that the idea?

582
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,248
Well, sorry.

583
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,448
Enjoy a jelly bean.

584
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,580
Hmm. Thanks.

585
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,388
What color did you get?

586
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,552
Yellow.

587
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,721
Oh, that's popcorn.
That's gross.

588
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,729
Well, thanks.

589
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,560
Told ya.

590
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,760
Danny, this isn't ev.. uhh.

591
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,581
All right.

592
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,964
All right.

593
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,665
Sorry.

594
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,310
How's my wife?

595
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,677
Uh, I don't know.

596
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,182
Sure she's been better, though.

597
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,312
I heard somewhere, I
think it was on NPR..

598
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,480
that you're supposed to talk
to people who are in a coma.

599
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,921
Play their favorite music.

600
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,288
It may help them or
get through to them.

601
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,418
Uh-huh.

602
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,859
But you're probably too busy..

603
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,228
getting up to speed on the
Warfield case, I suppose.

604
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,864
Excuse me?

605
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,736
Hmm?

606
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,709
Oh, no, I'm not.. I'm
not judging you, Willy.

607
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,905
No. Anyone coming from
what you came from..

608
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,506
then paying your way through
East Okie cowshit college..

609
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,107
and Tulsa Law by
writing papers..

610
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,015
for Princeton kids
on the internet..

611
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,486
My God, $60,000 in debt..

612
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,887
and 97% conviction rate.

613
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,858
Wow.

614
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,519
You deserve it, kiddo.

615
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,258
What have you been doing?

616
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,664
Oh, I'm permitted the use
of a private investigator.

617
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,327
Not to investigate me.

618
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,893
Why not? You're
investigating me.

619
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,531
Because you shot your wife.

620
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,133
Allegedly. That's how
it works, right?

621
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,405
If I can't introduce something
in court as evidence..

622
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,775
it doesn't exist legally.

623
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,906
L.. l.. I'm not gonna
play games with you.

624
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,214
I'm afraid you have
to, old sport.

625
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,181
What is this?

626
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,212
Wha.. what is it?

627
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,781
Some kinda, uh, form
of communication?

628
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,690
Uh-huh. You sent me
a box of papers.

629
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,059
It's called disc..

630
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,724
It's called
discovery, all right?

631
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,927
That's where the state
is legally obligated..

632
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,936
to provide all the evidence..

633
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,028
to the defendant..

634
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,698
so you can prepare your defense.

635
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,570
There's nothing in it, Willy.

636
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,202
You haven't actually
discovered anything.

637
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,470
That's one point of view.

638
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,711
Another might be that
I've hit the mother lode.

639
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,412
Oh, have they found the gun?

640
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,251
I don't need the gun
to convict you.

641
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,086
Huh.

642
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,092
Tell me something.

643
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,754
Does it bother you
that I call you Willy?

644
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,991
No.

645
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,431
No.

646
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,661
Willy.

647
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,304
Willy, I'd like you to
consider becoming my lawyer.

648
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,005
I'll pay you lots of money.

649
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,637
I'm prosecuting you.

650
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,081
Yes, but I'm giving
you a chance..

651
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,914
to get on the other side
of this unholy mess..

652
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,419
while you still can.

653
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,718
Right.

654
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,087
Are you out of your mind?

655
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,284
Ha ha.

656
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,190
I think, on advice of counsel..

657
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,956
I'll decline to answer that one.

658
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,259
All right. Well,
look, I'm gonna..

659
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,458
thank you for your offer.

660
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,967
I'm gonna stay right where I am.

661
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,832
At least for one more week.

662
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,701
Look, just keep this.

663
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,072
Don't send it back.

664
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,303
You need that.

665
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,312
You also need to come
up with a witness list.

666
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:26,077
No, I'll leave all the
witness crap to you.

667
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,811
Right. 'Cause you're not gonna..

668
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,149
You're not gonna
call any witnesses.

669
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,314
No, I'm innocent, remember,
until proven guilty.

670
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,687
Whatever.

671
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,123
You heard the judge.

672
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,649
You know that's not
grounds for an appeal.

673
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,820
Ah, what the heck.

674
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,330
Jury of my peers, and
so on and so forth.

675
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,592
Right.

676
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,166
You know, my grandfather
was, uh, an egg farmer.

677
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,364
This isn't gonna be
about your, uh..

678
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,500
rough childhood, is it?

679
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,067
No, I used to candle
eggs at his farm.

680
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,339
Do you know what that is?

681
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,779
You hold an egg up to the
light of a-a candle and, uh..

682
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,248
you look for imperfections.

683
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,511
The first time I did it..

684
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,178
he told me to put all the
eggs that were cracked..

685
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,551
or flawed into a
bucket for the bakery.

686
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,488
And, uh, he came
back an hour later..

687
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,515
and there were 300 eggs
in the bakery bucket.

688
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,254
He asked me what the
hell I was doing..

689
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,854
but I found a flaw in
every single one of them.

690
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:16,196
You know, thin places
in the shell and, uh..

691
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,168
fine hairline cracks.

692
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,202
You look closely enough..

693
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,264
you'll find everything
has a weak spot..

694
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,742
where it can break,
sooner or later.

695
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,609
You looking for mine?

696
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,618
I've already found yours.

697
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,620
What is it?

698
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,079
You're a winner, Willy.

699
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,222
Heh heh heh.

700
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,889
Yeah.

701
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,455
Well, I guess the joke's
on me, then, isn't it?

702
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,093
You bet your ass, old sport.

703
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,094
What time was that?

704
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,934
About, uh, 5:00.

705
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,304
Then she went into the house.

706
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,535
Prior to that..

707
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,236
had you seen Mr. Crawford
arrive at the house?

708
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,744
Yes.

709
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,803
When was that?

710
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,212
Earlier than usual.

711
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,307
Uh, maybe 4:00.

712
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,087
Did Mr. Crawford
park in the carport?

713
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,920
No, he always parks
in the garage.

714
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,586
He's very careful with his car.

715
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,027
Would you say that
Mr. Crawford..

716
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,791
was a very careful man?

717
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,059
Oh, yes.

718
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,498
Always.

719
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,334
Thank you.

720
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,333
No further questions,
Your Honor.

721
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,740
Mr. Crawford.

722
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,107
Uh, yes, Your Honor?

723
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,615
Uh, hello, Ciro.

724
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,562
No, M.. Mr. Crawford.

725
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,033
It.. It's your turn to
cross-examine this witness.

726
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,159
Oh, no.

727
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,532
No questions.

728
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,066
What time?

729
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,735
5:12 exactly.

730
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,506
We called in SWAT as
soon as we knew..

731
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,274
there was a possible
hostage situation..

732
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,577
and then I tried to
establish contact..

733
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,106
through the front gate intercom.

734
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,345
Any answer?

735
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,683
- None.
- What then?

736
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,188
Two other uniform
squads arrived.

737
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,951
We established a perimeter..

738
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,221
outside the walls as
quickly as possible..

739
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,160
to keep the house
under observation.

740
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,656
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry, Mr. Beachum.

741
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,396
Your Honor.

742
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,532
So the house was
completely surrounded..

743
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,371
within minutes of your arrival.

744
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,535
All four sides.

745
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,512
And neither you nor
any other officer..

746
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,176
saw anyone go into or
come out of that house.

747
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,206
No.

748
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,411
And what happened next?

749
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,717
The bullet pierced through
the frontal cortex..

750
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,881
and the temporal lobe..

751
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,857
coming to rest on the
upper right side..

752
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,882
of her brain, against the skull.

753
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,019
And degree of injury?

754
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,360
It inflicted grievous
and irreparable injury.

755
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,798
Dr. Kang, is it safe to say..

756
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,734
that someone who
inflicted this kind..

757
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,397
of wound intended to kill?

758
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,406
Oh.. a moment, uh..

759
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,566
Mr. Crawford?

760
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,405
Yes, Your Honor?

761
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,138
You might want to object.

762
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,705
The witness can't know
your state of mind.

763
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,444
Uh, no, thank you, Your Honor.

764
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,215
Proceed.

765
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,718
Sorry.

766
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,785
And after you put
down your gun..

767
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,762
what did Mr. Crawford do?

768
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,766
He confessed to
shooting his wife.

769
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,291
He confessed.

770
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,396
Now, did Mr. Crawford
appear confused..

771
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,068
intoxicated, or
impaired in any way?

772
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,098
No.

773
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,270
No, not at all.

774
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,778
He knew exactly
what was going on.

775
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:30,185
Detective Nunally, what
did Mr. Crawford say?

776
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,782
He said: "It was like I
just suddenly snapped."

777
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,658
"I got the gun and
I shot my wife."

778
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,093
"I shot her in the head."

779
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,289
Objection.

780
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,265
I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,
did you say something?

781
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,791
Yes, I wish to object.

782
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,303
On what grounds?

783
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,827
I don't know.

784
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,806
Your Honor..

785
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:54,641
Um, I don't know what, uh,
you'd call it, but, uh..

786
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,373
they.. It wasn't the first
time it happened either..

787
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,402
but, um..

788
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,312
I, um..

789
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,979
I don't know the.. uh,
legal terminology.

790
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,785
Well, why don't you try and
explain it in layman's terms?

791
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,750
Um..

792
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,658
fucking the victim.

793
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,497
Well, you said layman's terms.

794
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:20,798
Your Honor..

795
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,362
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but
what would you call it..

796
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,397
legally, when the officer
who arrested you was..

797
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,410
having sexual intercourse
with your wife?

798
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,071
You know, I think
it's objectionable.

799
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,012
It's rather disgusting is
what I think, but, uh..

800
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,743
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

801
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,112
Tss..

802
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,918
um, Rob?

803
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,656
Um..

804
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,559
Oh, shit.

805
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:53,762
Can I talk to you for a second?

806
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,429
Aah!

807
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,998
- Uhh!
- Aah!

808
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,373
Order. Order.

809
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,672
Just.. Bailiffs.. Order!

810
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,272
Order! Bailiffs! Please!

811
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,576
You lying son of a bitch.

812
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,413
We're in recess.

813
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,725
He had my witness list..

814
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,731
and he should've
filed to suppress.

815
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,392
My mistake. I'm sorry.

816
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,060
Mr. Crawford, you were warned.

817
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,933
You don't get to use that
as an excuse to play games.

818
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,665
Well, what about the
fact that it's true?

819
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,070
I mean, isn't that
the point here..

820
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,540
to get to the truth?

821
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,440
Mr. Beachum, is it true?

822
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,741
I have no idea, Your Honor..

823
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,747
I just heard about
it five minutes ago.

824
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,078
Put him back on the
witness stand..

825
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,208
if you don't believe me.

826
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,241
This is getting out
of hand, Your Honor.

827
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,379
Now, he just provoked
my witness..

828
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,082
with an outrageous allegation.

829
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,590
My Dick has evidence.

830
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,613
Excuse me?

831
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,921
My Dick, my private
investigator.

832
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,086
I call him Dick.

833
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,119
Perhaps I should call him
as a rebuttal witness.

834
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,425
Uh, because since the tragedy..

835
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,365
um, he's dug up hotel
records and witnesses..

836
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,426
that confirm that my
wife and Mr. Nunally..

837
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,458
were having an affair.

838
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,766
My Dick is good.

839
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,569
Your Honor, so what if he was?

840
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,597
Mr. Beachum.

841
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:06,939
Even if he was..

842
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,467
Your witness was intimate
with the victim..

843
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,777
and assaulted the defendant
during the arrest.

844
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:13,146
Actually, while
trying to obtain..

845
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,946
my so-called confession.

846
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,009
Yes.

847
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,248
Oh, come on.

848
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,188
Is that a legal argument,
"Oh, come on"?

849
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,953
Don't make me come across
this table 'cause I will..

850
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,153
I just want..

851
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,957
Your Honor, he dictated and
signed his confession..

852
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,624
at the station long after
the incident, all right?

853
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,462
In fear for my life,
since my wife's lover..

854
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,797
who had just beaten me..

855
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,201
uh, was in the room
with his friends..

856
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,262
and the other officers.

857
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,001
Was detective Nunally present..

858
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,838
during Mr. Crawford's
interrogation?

859
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:46,513
Uh.. he.. he.. he may
have been, I don't know.

860
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,812
Because if that is
indeed the case..

861
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,376
the confessions, both
of them, are out.

862
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,978
If Nunally was there..

863
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,717
Mr. Crawford was under duress.

864
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,850
The confessions and any
evidence gathered..

865
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:56,916
while Mr. Nunally was present..

866
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,984
will all have to be excluded..

867
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,495
as "fruit of the
poisonous tree."

868
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,518
This.. this is insane.

869
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,656
That's the Bible, isn't it?

870
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:02,824
The fruit of the
tree and all that?

871
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,992
It's Matthew.

872
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,002
Or is it Mark?

873
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,004
He set all this up.

874
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,404
This is a setup.

875
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,668
I'm sorry, Mr. Beachum..

876
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,006
but I am not going to allow
coerced confessions..

877
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,170
in my courtroom.

878
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,679
Your Honor, do you think
I could go home now..

879
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,839
with Thanksgiving
around the corner?

880
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,508
Unbelievable.

881
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,210
Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.

882
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,515
What I want to do is
I'm going to give..

883
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,713
Mr. Beachum a few days..

884
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,313
to come up with
some new evidence..

885
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,757
and if he can't then..
maybe you can go home.

886
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:34,025
So we will reconvene
on Monday morning.

887
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,224
I think that's all.

888
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,732
Thank you, Your Honor.

889
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,234
Farewell.

890
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,074
Didn't even have the
guts to come talk to me.

891
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,379
I was going to..

892
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,613
after I figured out..

893
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:57,881
uh!!

894
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,479
How I was gonna handle it.

895
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,787
What makes you think
that's your decision?

896
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,258
You taking me off this case?

897
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,229
Your bags are already packed.

898
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,754
Just go.

899
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,863
Even if I find new evidence?

900
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,891
From where?

901
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,733
The evidence store?

902
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,535
What, are they open early
the day after Thanksgiving?

903
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,408
My witness lied to me.

904
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,878
Yes, because he could.

905
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,278
Because you weren't looking.

906
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,611
And I know why.

907
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,140
Your head was in the fast
lane on your big salary.

908
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,777
So you picked that and
what we do here..

909
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,219
is not very important anymore.

910
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,916
So that's what this
is about, isn't it?

911
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,084
I'm not gonna be like
you in 20 years.

912
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,787
Hey, you be very careful.

913
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,422
You wanna judge
me, be my guest..

914
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,931
but this thing was a setup.

915
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,832
The confession, everything.

916
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,130
Maybe.

917
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,467
But it didn't have to turn
into a public humiliation..

918
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,439
for this office.

919
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,169
You walked in there unprepared.

920
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,508
You were arrogant and
sloppy, and you did damage.

921
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,843
How much, we don't
even know yet.

922
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,145
And I noticed you didn't
even care to ask.

923
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,616
But don't worry yourself, Willy.

924
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,710
We'll clean up after you.

925
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,977
Bourbon.

926
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,215
All right.

927
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,692
So..

928
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,163
you got killed today.

929
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,962
Gotta admire the
cleverness of it.

930
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,468
Oh, yeah?

931
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,494
Sure, give the devil his due.

932
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,370
So, what did Lobruto say?

933
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,269
Took me off the case.

934
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,709
Good.

935
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,337
- Is it?
- Yeah.

936
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,870
Damage control.

937
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,907
Look, you don't know this guy.

938
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,011
I had to fight with Burt today..

939
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,545
to stop him from firing you.

940
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,687
You want this, right?

941
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:25,723
Yeah.

942
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,069
Good.

943
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,677
I have to hang out
here another hour..

944
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,714
so..

945
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,216
I think you should go home.

946
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,277
And I'd like you
to call me later.

947
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,586
Call me later.

948
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,557
Hmm?

949
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,794
Hmm.

950
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,764
Mmm.

951
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,791
Mmm.

952
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,767
You, uh..

953
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,868
y.. you don't have to go.

954
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,845
Yeah, I do.

955
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,555
No big family Thanksgiving?

956
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:00,756
No.

957
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,128
Well, I have to..

958
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,831
put in some face time
with mine, if you want.

959
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,899
All right.

960
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,647
Thanks.

961
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,284
Don't thank me yet.

962
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,206
Mr. Beachum, can I help you?

963
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,642
Look, please, Mr. Beachum!

964
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,011
I want it back.

965
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,215
I take complete responsibility
for what happened.

966
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,216
Although I do feel..

967
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,556
like it would have
happened to anyone.

968
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,028
But if I'd been
paying attention..

969
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,362
it wouldn't happen to me.

970
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,527
I'm not giving you
back this case..

971
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,093
so you can repair your ego.

972
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,574
Well, it's not
just about my ego.

973
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:56,238
It's also about the fact
that, uh, this guy..

974
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,907
he's just enjoying all of this.

975
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,973
Enjoying this?

976
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,006
But that's not evidence.

977
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,643
Right, but..

978
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,086
someone's gotta put him away.

979
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,752
If you just give me a chance.

980
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,696
And if there's a
way, I'll find it.

981
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,359
And if you can't?

982
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,029
Listen, you leave
now, I replace you.

983
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,062
I'm covered, I took some action.

984
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,598
But if you go on with
this and you lose..

985
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,235
I guarantee you your
shiny new job..

986
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,075
will not be waiting for you.

987
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,910
And I can't keep you on here.

988
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,475
This is a public office.
Heads gotta roll.

989
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,117
Still want it back?

990
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,790
Thank you.

991
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,232
Yeah.

992
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,996
The gun's in the house.

993
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,440
Yeah, except it's also just not.

994
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,737
Then what'd he do, Detective?

995
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,539
He tie it to a goddamn
helium balloon?

996
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,977
Maybe.

997
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,209
Maybe he, uh..
dissolved it in acid.

998
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,649
You got a DOB on that?

999
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,016
You know, Detective..

1000
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,217
your inability to do
your job effectively..

1001
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,818
is making it very difficult
for me to do mine.

1002
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,850
All right?

1003
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,487
I'm back in trial..

1004
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,794
on Monday.

1005
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,231
OK, fine.

1006
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,359
I'll get a team together.

1007
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,926
I'll go over it one more time.

1008
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,905
And that's it.

1009
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,845
My wife took the
kids to her mom's.

1010
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:44,081
And I got the media all
over my front lawn.

1011
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,554
What were you thinking?

1012
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,525
You get called to your
girlfriend's house?

1013
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,188
I didn't know it was her house.

1014
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,856
Well, it's her last name.

1015
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,166
I didn't know her last name.

1016
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,833
Not her real one, anyway.

1017
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:11,677
We just.. we met at the Miramar,
same time, twice a week and..

1018
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,114
There were no questions asked
and there were no phone calls..

1019
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,675
and that's just the.. that's..
those were the rules.

1020
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,186
Those were her rules.

1021
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,882
All right. Did you, uh..

1022
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,788
get the feeling that she
had all these rules..

1023
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,724
'cause she'd been doing it
before with other guys?

1024
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,724
Be honest.

1025
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:27,991
No.

1026
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,329
Listen, I don't know if
you can understand this..

1027
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,391
because you're a
fucking lawyer, but..

1028
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,527
this thing that we had..

1029
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,696
whatever it was, it was real.

1030
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,863
It wasn't just an affair.

1031
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,430
This girl, she made
me feel like..

1032
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,567
What was I supposed to do?

1033
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,407
Tell me.

1034
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,643
I tried to warn you, didn't I?

1035
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,615
No, you warned me
that he was smart.

1036
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,592
You didn't warn me..

1037
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,116
that you were stupid.

1038
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,753
Fuck you, you little punk.

1039
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:00,785
Fuck you!

1040
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,388
Fuck me?

1041
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,229
Oh, you already did that.

1042
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,700
I didn't think that he knew, OK?

1043
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:06,793
I didn't.. There was..

1044
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,497
There was no way for me
to know that he knew.

1045
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,972
I just thought the guy
was fucking nuts!

1046
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,167
Ya know?!

1047
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,154
Y'all got security
cameras, right?

1048
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,393
Uh, yes, we do.

1049
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,368
Can I get a copy of those
tapes from November 10th?

1050
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,166
Uh, as soon as I can.

1051
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,604
Uhh..

1052
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,632
I'm just.. I'm a little..
I'm, uh, under the gun, here.

1053
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:47,665
Oh.

1054
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,617
That's, uh, exactly
the way he left 'em?

1055
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,987
Yes.

1056
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,980
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,026
What, were they planning
a trip next week?

1058
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,065
Excuse me.

1059
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,835
Crawford Aeronautics.

1060
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,310
Yes, he is.

1061
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,176
It's for you.

1062
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,204
Just pick up line one.

1063
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,746
Hello?

1064
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,190
Hey, Willy, old sport.
How is it going?

1065
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,750
Uh..

1066
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,786
well, I'm..

1067
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,856
Still out here and you're
still in there, so..

1068
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,527
Yeah, you're right, there.

1069
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,832
So the world still
makes sense, does it?

1070
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,531
Uh, have you got everything
you need, Willy?

1071
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,369
Uh, would you like some coffee?

1072
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,971
No, thank you.

1073
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,172
OK.

1074
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,579
You got some new
evidence, have you?

1075
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,781
What's the matter, Willy,
aren't we friends anymore?

1076
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,151
I'm trying to help you.

1077
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,214
You're in a bad place and
you've nowhere else to turn.

1078
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,519
OK, I'm gonna hang up.

1079
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,550
Uh, do me a favor,
will you, pal?

1080
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,892
Ask Tina to cancel
my wife's tickets.

1081
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,626
Yeah, we had, uh, plans
to travel, you see.

1082
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,566
Get away, so to speak.

1083
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,829
Next week, actually.

1084
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,996
Sort of a, you know,
second honeymoon.

1085
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,974
Uh, painfully ironic,
that part, I must say.

1086
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:29,569
But I.. I.. I don't think, uh,
Jennifer's gonna make it, Willy.

1087
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:30,601
Do you?

1088
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:42,921
Whew.

1089
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,256
Well..

1090
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,784
tore the whole thing apart.

1091
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,826
No gun.

1092
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,465
I'm sorry, Willy.

1093
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,566
Good night.

1094
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,328
"Do you dare stay out?

1095
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:30,839
"Do you dare go in?"

1096
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,302
"How much can you lose?

1097
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,403
"How much can you win?

1098
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,176
"And if you go in, should
you turn left or right?

1099
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,844
"Or right and three-quarters?

1100
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:45,649
"Or maybe not quite?

1101
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,315
"You can get so confused..

1102
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:49,051
"that you'll start in to race..

1103
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:54,393
"down long wiggled roads
at a break-necking pace..

1104
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,888
"and grind on for miles
across weirdish wild space..

1105
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:03,895
"headed I fear towards
a most useless place..

1106
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,306
"the waiting place.

1107
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,545
"For people just waiting.

1108
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,943
"Waiting for a train to go..

1109
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,679
"or for a bus to come..

1110
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,584
"or a plane to go..

1111
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,614
"or the mail to come
or the rain to go..

1112
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:27,686
"or the phone to ring
or the snow to snow..

1113
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,723
"or waiting around
for a yes or a no.."

1114
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:38,036
"or a string of pearls
or a pair of pants..

1115
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,066
"or a wig with curls.."

1116
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,906
"or another chance."

1117
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:47,773
What are you doing?

1118
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,684
Hmph.

1119
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,225
Uh..

1120
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,888
I heard that it might help.

1121
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,260
Who told you that?

1122
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,423
Um..

1123
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,096
the guy who shot her.

1124
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,695
Mmm.

1125
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,905
Are you a member of the family?

1126
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,343
I'm from the district
attorney's office.

1127
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,612
Um..

1128
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,742
and we..

1129
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,617
ran out of witnesses.

1130
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,947
You know, she moved earlier.

1131
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,453
She moved her eyelids..

1132
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,189
like she was trying
to open up her eyes.

1133
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,662
Yeah, well.. sometimes
we have to tape..

1134
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,925
their eyes shut.

1135
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,023
They all move, they..

1136
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,966
they twitch, they make sounds.

1137
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,263
You think they're dreaming,
but they're not.

1138
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,895
It's just..

1139
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,633
It's just what's
left of the system.

1140
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,843
Normal reflex is downward.

1141
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,643
Up indicates brain trauma.

1142
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,281
Even if she comes back..

1143
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,786
she may not remember
how to speak..

1144
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,287
let alone who shot her.

1145
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,347
What if she can hear you?

1146
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,916
She can't.

1147
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,423
It happens, right?

1148
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,955
People wake up. It's
not impossible.

1149
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:13,861
What are you gonna do?

1150
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,302
Keep asking the same
question different ways..

1151
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,464
till you get the
answer you want?

1152
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,574
I guess. That's what I do.

1153
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,675
Hmm.

1154
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,345
I knew I shoulda
gone to law school.

1155
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,358
Did you like it?

1156
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,860
I thought it was so funny..

1157
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,419
when he did that
dance at the end.

1158
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,090
Ha ha ha.

1159
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,668
Would you like some more wine?

1160
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,509
Are you not gonna
eat your turkey?

1161
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,913
I'm a vegetarian.

1162
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,177
Heh heh heh.

1163
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,548
White or dark meat
this time, Willy?

1164
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,280
Oh, it doesn't matter
either way, Your Honor.

1165
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,618
I think, uh, Willy's already
chosen the dark side.

1166
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:41,850
Ha ha!

1167
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,359
Mr. Sierra Club and
Ms. ACLU here..

1168
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,554
tend to give me a hard
time at the holidays..

1169
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,857
because I can buy and sell them.

1170
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,922
We're not actually
for sale, Nik.

1171
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,125
All right, well,
since you have..

1172
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,759
the advantage on all of us..

1173
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,794
surely it won't bother
you if we just mention..

1174
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,772
to Willy that he could
put his talents..

1175
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,604
to more noble use.

1176
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,234
You don't have to do this.

1177
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,608
Oh, that's all right.

1178
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,579
I get this from time to time.

1179
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,706
And it's most always
from people with money.

1180
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:07,909
Oop.

1181
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,315
You win.

1182
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,216
I usually do.

1183
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,153
Except in trial this week.

1184
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,089
Nice, Lee.

1185
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,388
It's not over till it's over.

1186
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,417
That looked pretty over.

1187
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,989
Anyway, Willy's off
the case, so..

1188
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,262
well, it may not seem
like it now, Willy..

1189
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,565
but it's really a
blessing in disguise.

1190
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,470
Well, I'm actually not.

1191
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,530
What?

1192
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,371
Off the case. I'm back on it.

1193
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,671
But that doesn't make any sense.

1194
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,338
Lobruto has to do some
kind of damage control.

1195
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,118
Yeah, well..

1196
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,143
I asked him to let me finish it.

1197
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,195
You didn't think I might
want to know that?

1198
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,625
Did you hear me..

1199
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,156
when I said I had to convince
Burt not to fire you?

1200
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:03,437
Could we not do this here?

1201
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,669
Fine.

1202
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,806
Actually, I need
to talk with you.

1203
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,217
You lied to me.

1204
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,312
It doesn't work with me.

1205
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,481
Hey, uh, now, I
didn't lie to you.

1206
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,649
I told you I could
be ready in time..

1207
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,157
and I still can
be ready in time.

1208
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,683
I got one thing, one
thing I gotta do first.

1209
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,491
You're not in yet, Willy!

1210
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,497
You pulled a stunt!

1211
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:29,657
You got your foot in the door.

1212
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,687
Did it ever occur to you..

1213
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:31,825
that I could still
win this case?

1214
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:32,993
I don't care!

1215
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,263
That's not what this is about!

1216
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,668
What the hell is it about?

1217
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,502
It's about whether or not you
can do what you're told.

1218
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,099
You wanted corporate, right?

1219
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,166
That was the point.

1220
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,337
Did I misunderstand that?

1221
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,837
If you do this, if you
win, I'm still screwed.

1222
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:49,043
It says I don't know what
my subordinates are doing..

1223
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,076
my judgment is bad, and I'm
not in charge of my team.

1224
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,180
I went out on a limb.

1225
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,248
I told Burt this was over.

1226
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,718
I didn't ask you
to do that, Nik.

1227
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:18,875
You know what nobody
understands..

1228
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:19,938
about certain kinds..

1229
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,780
of low-paid public service work?

1230
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:28,019
Every now and then you get
to put a fucking stake..

1231
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,719
in a bad guy's heart.

1232
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,420
Now, we're not supposed
to talk about that..

1233
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,090
when we visit a third grade
classroom for career day..

1234
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,099
and it doesn't get
you very far..

1235
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,431
into a country
club locker room..

1236
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,771
but it's hard to beat when
you actually get to do it.

1237
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,249
I have some work to do.

1238
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,585
Thank your family very
much for a lovely evening.

1239
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,454
Thank you, Judge Gardner.

1240
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,647
Officer.

1241
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,655
We gotta find the gun.

1242
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,593
I had three teams
out there already.

1243
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,624
He did this.

1244
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,729
We know he did it, right?

1245
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,761
So..

1246
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,441
let's find it.

1247
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,137
We can't.

1248
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,373
You wanna move on?

1249
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,854
I know a guy in the evidence
room, and he owes me a favor.

1250
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:18,329
He can swap these for the
shells in evidence..

1251
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:22,565
give us a ballistic match,
and we'll have our gun.

1252
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,507
Go home.

1253
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,675
What else you got, man?

1254
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,184
Go home.

1255
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,708
What else you got, Willy?

1256
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,385
This is Willy Beachum.

1257
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,125
You tell me what I need to know.

1258
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,359
Hey, it's me.

1259
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:58,863
Things sorta got outta
hand today, and I guess..

1260
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,033
well, I guess th..

1261
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,337
I guess this is something
neither of us..

1262
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,901
was expecting in our
lives right now.

1263
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:06,278
And I.. I think we have to..

1264
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,215
I think we have to f..

1265
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,514
to figure out what
to do about that.

1266
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,213
This is where to find me.

1267
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,381
Call me.

1268
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:19,322
You have one unheard message.

1269
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,194
Sent today at 4:10 p.m.

1270
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,558
Hi, Mr. Beachum.

1271
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,897
This is Stephanie
from Miramar Hotel.

1272
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:28,334
The security tapes you
were asking for are ready.

1273
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,361
You can pick them up anytime
at the reception desk.

1274
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,395
Thanks.

1275
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,746
You know it's him, all right?

1276
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,912
There's no doubt that
that guy is him.

1277
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:45,977
Whew.

1278
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,785
Well, there's no face.

1279
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,725
So? We enhance it.

1280
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,486
You want me to enhance a hat.

1281
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,759
You know that is him..

1282
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,630
and he's there on the
day he shot her.

1283
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,294
And why is he there the day of?

1284
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,302
What?

1285
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,361
Why is he there the day of?

1286
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,429
What are you talking about?

1287
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,599
This is a guy who
plans everything..

1288
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,108
down to the hat, OK?

1289
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,769
What's he doing
there the day of?

1290
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,904
What part of the plan is that?

1291
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:11,935
What the f..

1292
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:14,946
OK.

1293
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:18,316
He's there because he's
gotta see it for himself.

1294
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,445
They're at the pool.

1295
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:20,785
Yeah, they're at the pool.

1296
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,814
He's jealous, his wife's
having an affair.

1297
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,018
No, no, man.

1298
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,458
Come on. He's there.
He's getting worked up.

1299
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,018
He's about to shoot her.
He's trying on the dress.

1300
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,324
He's sniffing her panties.

1301
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,126
This guy, this guy here?

1302
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,257
He's a psycho.

1303
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,961
And the point is that
you're missing, Willy..

1304
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,469
he's a psycho we
just caught on tape.

1305
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,369
You got motive.

1306
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,532
I do not have motive.

1307
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:39,598
You..

1308
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,666
I don't have motive
unless I have him..

1309
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,304
and I don't have face,
so I don't have him.

1310
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,938
That is such lawyer shit.

1311
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,380
It is lawyer shit!

1312
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,647
Why d'ya think I'm getting
outta criminal law?

1313
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:51,880
Huh?

1314
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,978
And I'll tell ya something.

1315
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,989
I'm not gonna end my
career on a case..

1316
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,615
where all I have is
an enhanced hat..

1317
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,024
when what I shoulda had
was a murder weapon!

1318
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,323
That is new evidence.

1319
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,057
And what I should've had
was a signed confession!

1320
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,894
I told ya from day one
that he was playing games.

1321
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,559
And you were the man
shoulda got that for me!

1322
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,590
That is a cop-out.

1323
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:07,659
Don't you tell me that.

1324
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,000
You couldn't find my gun..

1325
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,334
and you're the one
that let Nunally..

1326
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:12,533
take the confession of
a guy he just beat up!

1327
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,940
Nunally? Nunally lied to
me, that's what happened!

1328
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,546
I gotta go make a
case outta nothing.

1329
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,880
Just being an asshole.

1330
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,270
Uh, Beachum.

1331
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,574
It's done.

1332
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,105
In the toolshed, taped
to the lawn mower blade.

1333
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,132
2-10 eastbound.

1334
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,804
District attorney's office.

1335
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,617
Can I talk to you?

1336
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,186
Have a seat.

1337
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,220
OK.

1338
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,832
I'm not mad at you or anything.

1339
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:26,340
Oh. OK.

1340
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:31,110
Um, are you all right?

1341
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,845
Ahhh.

1342
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,983
Hmm.

1343
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,956
Can I ask you to do something
for me this morning?

1344
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:44,981
Yeah.

1345
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,518
You got your cell phone on you?

1346
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:48,688
Yeah.

1347
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,802
Could you sit outside
the courtroom?

1348
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,066
'Cause I might call you.

1349
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,699
And if I do..

1350
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,538
uh, just hang up.

1351
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:08,381
You come inside and whisper
something in my ear about..

1352
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,578
finding the murder weapon.

1353
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,079
You found it.

1354
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,352
I haven't decided that yet.

1355
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,561
OK.

1356
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,558
OK.

1357
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,631
Mr. Beachum.

1358
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,563
Mr. Beachum, sir.

1359
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,803
Mr. Beachum. Mr. Beachum.

1360
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:10,709
Mr. Beachum.

1361
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,191
Mr. Beachum.

1362
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:38,104
Uh, Your Honor, um..

1363
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,301
I would like to submit
a motion at this time.

1364
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,642
What.. What type of
motion, Mr. Crawford?

1365
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,170
I move for a judgment
of acquittal.

1366
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,139
Objection.

1367
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,515
On what grounds?

1368
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,248
Well, the prosecutor doesn't
have any actual evidence..

1369
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,755
proving that I did anything.

1370
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,820
I'm about to present my
evidence, Your Honor.

1371
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,225
But all of his witnesses
will testify..

1372
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,093
to the, uh, same facts..

1373
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,621
that, uh, my wife was
shot and that I was, uh..

1374
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,725
tragically in the
house at the time..

1375
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,133
and, in a way, a victim myself.

1376
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,831
And, uh, I'll stipulate
to the testimony..

1377
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,395
of Mr. Beachum's entire
witness list right now.

1378
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,771
And accordingly I move
for a judgment of..

1379
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,401
I'm sorry. Under
the California..

1380
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,308
uh, penal code section 11-18.1..

1381
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,471
for a judgment of acquittal..

1382
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:19,639
on the ground that
the evidence..

1383
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,807
before this court
is insufficient..

1384
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,214
to sustain a conviction.

1385
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,717
Thank you.

1386
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,448
Your legal skills seem
to have improved..

1387
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,854
over the long weekend,
Mr. Crawford.

1388
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:36,320
Mr. Beachum, have you
any new evidence?

1389
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:37,991
Your Honor..

1390
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,536
may I have a moment, Your Honor?

1391
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:12,856
Uh..

1392
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,095
Your Honor.

1393
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,400
Mr. Beachum.

1394
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:30,878
Mr. Beachum.

1395
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:56,271
I have no further evidence
at this time, Your Honor.

1396
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:10,390
Motion for a judgment of
acquittal is granted.

1397
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,293
The jury is released
with our apologies..

1398
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,126
and the defendant is free to go.

1399
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,467
Thank you, Your Honor.

1400
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,498
Well, even a broken clock..

1401
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:30,306
gets to be right twice a day.

1402
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,482
Hey, Rob, take it easy, huh?

1403
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,044
Willy?

1404
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,984
Hey, I just heard.

1405
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,350
I'm sorry.

1406
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:16,014
What'd you think, I
wasn't keeping tabs?

1407
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,357
I don't know what I thought.

1408
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,665
Listen, what do you say..

1409
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,157
I take you out tonight and
get you completely trashed?

1410
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,795
Tomorrow's just a travel day.

1411
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,897
What was that? Willy?

1412
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:37,572
Are you there?

1413
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,540
Over here!

1414
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,931
Initial there and there,
sign and date at the bottom.

1415
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:02,208
Mr. Beachum.

1416
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,718
What a surprise.

1417
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:07,050
Now don't tell me, let me guess.

1418
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:08,953
You've got, uh, religion
or something, haven't you?

1419
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,150
You've found God and
all that stuff.

1420
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,284
'Cause it's not
just the winning..

1421
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:13,521
or the losing anymore, is it?

1422
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,529
It's the injustice of it.

1423
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,552
Heh heh.

1424
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,895
This is priceless.

1425
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,229
Oh, come on, Willy.

1426
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,862
You gotta let me enjoy this
just a little bit, old sport.

1427
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,935
You really need to be
nice to me now, Willy.

1428
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:37,150
Why?

1429
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,153
Because..

1430
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,087
what's left of a life..

1431
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:43,056
depends on a machine
powered by a cord..

1432
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,925
that leads to a plug in
an electrical outlet..

1433
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,794
and I decide when
it gets pulled.

1434
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:51,298
That's why.

1435
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:34,440
Excuse me. I'm looking for, uh..

1436
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,464
I'll just call you.

1437
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,499
Oh, never mind. Thank you.

1438
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,637
I called you all night.

1439
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,147
And I need your help.

1440
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:41,808
I don't know anything
about civil court.

1441
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:42,975
And I gotta get..

1442
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,143
a restraining order right away.

1443
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:45,447
This guy's gonna pull
the plug on her.

1444
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:46,646
What are you doing?

1445
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:47,882
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1446
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:48,980
You shouldn't be here.

1447
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,320
I gotta tie him up in court.

1448
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:51,484
I gotta challenge his
health care proxy.

1449
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:52,788
I gotta find somebody.

1450
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:53,987
I don't know who.

1451
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,996
Like a.. a.. a family member
or something to stop him.

1452
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,122
I really tried, Willy.

1453
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,154
Hey, hey, hey.

1454
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,167
Don't.

1455
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,192
This man's gonna kill his wife.

1456
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,911
This man's gonna kill his wife.

1457
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,040
And what does that have
to do with Wooton Sims?

1458
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,712
Hey. Excuse me.

1459
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,050
Hey. Sorry.

1460
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:54,554
Do you know any
civil court judges?

1461
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:55,886
Drop it.

1462
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,892
Do you know any
civil court judges?

1463
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,393
I just need a number.

1464
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,055
Have you been at
home at all today?

1465
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:04,291
No, I've been trying
to find somebody..

1466
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:05,959
who can put me in touch
with a civil court judge.

1467
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,230
There's a restraining
order out against you.

1468
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:11,397
I've got a.. a restraining
order against me?

1469
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,066
You were at the hospital.

1470
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,905
- Right? Overnight.
- Heh heh heh heh ha!

1471
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:17,570
And he got one against me?

1472
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:19,239
Yeah. He has a lawyer now.

1473
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,043
They went to Judge
Gorman this morning.

1474
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,276
Hold on a second.
Who's his lawyer?

1475
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:23,578
Is it Goldstein?

1476
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,882
Listen to yourself. He
can have you arrested.

1477
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,913
Your one shot. You had it. OK?

1478
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,152
I know I had one shot and
I blew it, all right?

1479
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,922
Yeah. And he walked.

1480
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,929
And there is nothing we can do.

1481
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:38,557
He's a private citizen now.
We have no standing.

1482
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:41,466
When you're done, you are done.

1483
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:43,129
Those are the rules.

1484
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:48,173
What about.. her?

1485
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,803
You have to worry
about yourself now.

1486
01:30:53,815 --> 01:30:56,784
No, I've.. I've, you
know, done that.

1487
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,647
I've done a lotta that.

1488
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,211
Your Honor?

1489
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:36,053
I got nowhere else to go.

1490
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:43,886
Hi, Ted.

1491
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,455
Hi.

1492
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,731
It probably won't
hold up on appeal.

1493
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,862
I just need the time.

1494
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:54,331
Here we go.

1495
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,662
Reflexes, no change.

1496
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,377
Turn off the ventilator.

1497
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,212
Ah.

1498
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,279
Hey.

1499
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:07,571
Hey!

1500
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,455
Hey, what's going on?

1501
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:20,392
- Step outside, please.
- Look, I got a court order.

1502
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:21,827
I'm sorry. Just step outside.

1503
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:23,159
I got a c..

1504
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:24,664
I got.. I got a court order.

1505
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:25,996
I'm sorry. Just step outside.

1506
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:28,297
I got a c..

1507
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:38,228
You're not answering your phone.

1508
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:41,868
That's kind of an answer
in itself, isn't it?

1509
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:48,010
Need a hand with this?

1510
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,039
Uhh.

1511
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,446
Can I get you a
beer or something?

1512
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:55,580
Ha.

1513
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:58,556
Uhh.

1514
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,085
Thank you.

1515
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,397
So what now?

1516
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:09,566
Something else.

1517
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:19,170
You belong in the
prosecutor's office.

1518
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:22,848
Well, what happened to
"head's must roll"?

1519
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:24,908
Yeah, well, it's my office.

1520
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:29,086
Least until the next election.

1521
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,755
Thank you, but no, thank you.

1522
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:35,251
We all lose, Willy.

1523
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,364
I let a man get
away with murder.

1524
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,104
How am I supposed
to live with that?

1525
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,533
Well, you learn to.

1526
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:52,275
Well, I hope not.

1527
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:58,549
All right.

1528
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:09,125
Well, you know, if it makes
you feel any better..

1529
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:12,496
technically you let a man get
away with attempted murder.

1530
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,467
For what it's worth.

1531
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,151
Yeah? All right.

1532
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,646
I got it all right here.
I finished the r..

1533
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:08,848
It's in the box right
now, it's coming.

1534
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:10,823
It's.. Just a sec.

1535
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:13,656
Hey, honey. I'm just on a call.

1536
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:15,355
Yeah. OK, just a sec.

1537
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,126
No. I will not do that.

1538
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,690
It's not.. and thank you. Good.

1539
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:22,258
Right.

1540
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:24,999
Well, I've.. l.. like I
said, reports are done.

1541
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,870
They're on their way.

1542
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:29,565
Hey, hon.

1543
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:30,736
No, did you get the suit?

1544
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:32,006
Yeah, yeah, I got it cut.

1545
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,070
Can I read that?

1546
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:34,307
OK, hon.

1547
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,839
Um, I'll pick up the kids,
see you at the school.

1548
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:39,045
I'll bring the suit.

1549
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,247
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm leaving right now.

1550
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:44,223
I am not going to be late, OK?

1551
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:46,315
Hey.

1552
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,349
Why don't you go home?

1553
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:48,520
Huh?

1554
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:49,859
Get a life.

1555
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:50,886
Huh?

1556
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:54,864
Alrighty.

1557
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,870
Turn off the lights
when you're done.

1558
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:58,599
Yeah, hon?

1559
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,100
It's yours.

1560
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,838
Here.

1561
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:12,683
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1562
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,052
Hello, old sport.

1563
01:38:20,261 --> 01:38:22,388
Ah, Willy.

1564
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:24,124
Can you hear me?

1565
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:28,901
I called to say goodbye.

1566
01:38:28,936 --> 01:38:30,062
I'm leaving tonight..

1567
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:32,937
on that second honeymoon
we talked about.

1568
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,065
Uh-huh.

1569
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:35,097
Won't be quite the same..

1570
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:37,269
without our Jennifer,
though, will it?

1571
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,411
Anyway, I have a little
something for you.

1572
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:42,745
It's a present, a little gift..

1573
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:46,617
and I was gonna send it
to Wooton Sims but, uh..

1574
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:49,452
I guess that's not
working out anymore..

1575
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:53,392
and the DA's office didn't
have a forwarding address.

1576
01:38:54,795 --> 01:38:59,095
Um, do you have any suggestions?

1577
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:24,414
Uh, just let yourself in.

1578
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,221
I'll be right out.

1579
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:23,978
Good evening, Willy.

1580
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,387
So, what do you think?

1581
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:37,058
Oh, yeah, that's..

1582
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,191
really..

1583
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:41,167
really, really nice of you.

1584
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:47,699
A simple "No, thank you," uh..

1585
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:51,541
is the preferred etiquette
when declining a gift.

1586
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:00,419
Takes a very special
sort of person..

1587
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:05,517
to look into someone's eyes
and shoot them, Willy.

1588
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:10,590
A certain kind of strength..

1589
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:12,428
if you know what I mean.

1590
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:17,434
Well, I guess you'd know
that, wouldn't you?

1591
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:19,268
Oh, yes, I would.

1592
01:41:24,445 --> 01:41:26,913
Anyway..

1593
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:29,040
I've got another bag to pick up.

1594
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,313
Don't you start shooting
without me now, will you?

1595
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:48,598
I noticed something.

1596
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,305
It's a little late.

1597
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,776
Aw, hell, it's a lot late.

1598
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:01,514
But I noticed..

1599
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,116
that, uh..

1600
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:11,951
you and Nunally have
the exact same gun.

1601
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:15,653
So?

1602
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:17,926
Well, that's why you
went to the hotel..

1603
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:19,432
that afternoon, isn't it?

1604
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,903
You took his, you put
yours in his place.

1605
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:31,477
I gave it back.

1606
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,209
Right, you gave it back.

1607
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:40,384
When all he could see was her.

1608
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:45,419
And then you knew
that he would just..

1609
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:46,653
walk the murder weapon..

1610
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:48,524
right outta the
house, didn't you?

1611
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,022
That's very clever.

1612
01:42:57,538 --> 01:42:59,199
It wasn't just clever.

1613
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:01,663
Admit it, Willy.

1614
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:03,232
It was beautiful.

1615
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:07,006
He sat through the
entire trial..

1616
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:11,677
wearing the only piece
of evidence on his hip.

1617
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,709
Yeah.

1618
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:16,553
Then he used it on himself.

1619
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:19,748
Well..

1620
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:25,030
sometimes life gives us
these little gifts..

1621
01:43:25,065 --> 01:43:26,430
if you know what I mean.

1622
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:29,994
I do know what you mean.

1623
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,562
I know exactly what
you mean because..

1624
01:43:34,408 --> 01:43:36,239
I got the bullet.

1625
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:42,613
The one in your wife's head.

1626
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:44,048
That one we couldn't take out..

1627
01:43:44,084 --> 01:43:45,381
as long as she was alive.

1628
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,854
I'm pretty sure it's
gonna match Nunally's..

1629
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,754
and that gives me
the murder weapon.

1630
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:00,260
Nicely done, Willy.

1631
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,100
Truly.

1632
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:09,940
Heh.

1633
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:21,087
A regular chain of evidence.

1634
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:23,248
Neat stuff.

1635
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:24,587
Vivid.

1636
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:27,423
Heartbreaking.

1637
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:30,760
The victim cries out
from beyond the grave.

1638
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:32,094
Aye.

1639
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:33,258
Yeah. Heh heh.

1640
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,097
Juries love all
that sort of crap.

1641
01:44:35,135 --> 01:44:36,466
Don't they?

1642
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:39,267
I bet you don't even need
a confession anymore..

1643
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:41,672
do you, Willy?

1644
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,539
Oh, I tell you what,
though, old sport.

1645
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:46,011
Uh, let's make you a
new one just in case.

1646
01:44:46,046 --> 01:44:49,641
The real deal, all
the juicy details.

1647
01:44:50,984 --> 01:44:53,282
You can get your rocks off
on that, then, can't you?

1648
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,480
Huh?

1649
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:56,850
Yeah.

1650
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,451
I shot my wife in the face.

1651
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:04,293
Right there.

1652
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:07,061
She didn't look so
pretty after that.

1653
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,261
And I stood there
looking down at her.

1654
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:13,296
And I watched her
eyes go all empty.

1655
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,207
I could smell the
blood and the shit.

1656
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:19,477
Smelled like metal.

1657
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:20,980
And the look on his face.

1658
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:23,141
Aw, heh. He's trying to get
her back to life, you see.

1659
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:24,377
And I was pissing
myself laughing..

1660
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:26,716
because I took both
the bastards out..

1661
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:29,187
with one fucking bullet.

1662
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:34,827
Yeah.

1663
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:37,329
And now you've got your
little bullet, haven't you?

1664
01:45:37,364 --> 01:45:39,161
Got what you want.

1665
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:40,666
So bring it all on, kiddo.

1666
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,328
Bring it all into court.

1667
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:48,330
Except you can't, can you?

1668
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:52,505
Let's see, now, first year
law, double jeopardy.

1669
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:54,013
I went to trial, you lost.

1670
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:55,514
Oh, pity about that.

1671
01:45:55,549 --> 01:45:59,007
Uh, doesn't matter
what you do now.

1672
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,986
Doesn't matter what you know.

1673
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:03,854
I mean, she could come back
from the dead, you see..

1674
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:09,658
and testify, spill the beans,
and it would mean.. nothing.

1675
01:46:14,568 --> 01:46:18,402
So you.. can't touch me.

1676
01:46:19,906 --> 01:46:21,771
Ever.

1677
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:34,619
She was alive.

1678
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:48,233
When you first went to trial
for attempted murder..

1679
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:50,429
your wife was still alive.

1680
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:56,440
But you just had to pull
that plug, didn't you?

1681
01:46:57,611 --> 01:46:59,272
Hmm?

1682
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,810
Well, now she's dead,
and that's murder.

1683
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:04,407
That's homicide, first degree..

1684
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:06,248
and that's new charges.

1685
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:08,277
There's new evidence.

1686
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:12,285
That's a new trial.

1687
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:20,964
Get the fuck out of my house.

1688
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:26,629
All right.

1689
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:28,801
Whew.

1690
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:33,135
I just don't know why
you didn't let it go.

1691
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:37,446
Doctor said, uh..

1692
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:39,645
she probably woulda
outlived us all.

1693
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:15,186
All rise.

1694
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,460
The superior court
of Los Angeles..

1695
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:21,791
people of the state
of California..

1696
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:23,625
versus Theodore Crawford.

1697
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:27,030
The honorable judge
Joseph Pinkus presiding.

1698
01:48:38,545 --> 01:48:40,706
Are the people
ready, Mr. Beachum?

1699
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:44,516
Very well.

1700
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,678
We will now proceed with
opening statements.

1701
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,212
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, what you hear..

1702
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:58,200
