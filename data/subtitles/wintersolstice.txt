1
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:56,785
John Weiner steps in.

2
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,654
He bunts, third base side.
Pitcher's only play is first base.

3
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,353
And he throws the ball away.

4
00:01:04,496 --> 00:01:06,123
Son-of-a-bitch.

5
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:10,793
He's gonna try for three.
And the relay throw...

6
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:11,868
...is not in time!

7
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,232
I can't watch like this.

8
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:15,774
What are you doing?

9
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,208
One second.

10
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,571
What are you doing to my TV?

11
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,507
One second.

12
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:20,737
What are you doing?

13
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,245
Move your head.

14
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:31,755
I want...

15
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,881
...Please.
- Oh you, goof ball.

16
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:35,789
I said move. I watching the game.

17
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:36,417
Alright.

18
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:37,551
Alright?

19
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,993
Come on. Yeah hit me.

20
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:47,829
Hey!

21
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,673
I said move.

22
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,102
Dude!

23
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,406
I'll make you eat this thing.

24
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:56,445
Okay.

25
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,872
What about the ivy?

26
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,941
Ah... leave it 'til last.

27
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,271
It's first off this morning.

28
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:08,843
Hey there.

29
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,208
Good morning.

30
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,941
Good morning.

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,709
Getting busy, I guess.

32
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:16,684
Um-hmm.

33
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,255
Is Gabe driving you today?

34
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,153
Yeah, is he late?

35
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,452
Well, you'd better check.

36
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,092
Gabe?

37
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,992
Alright.
Just give me a minute, alright?

38
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:26,859
Yep.

39
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,292
Pete.

40
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,201
Pete, are you up?

41
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:38,832
He's up. Stop it.

42
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,145
Fine Dude! I'm up. God!

43
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,146
You're sure now?

44
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,341
- Yes!
- Okay.

45
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:51,778
Hey.

46
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,249
How you doin'?

47
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,560
Oh, I'm crazy this afternoon. Umm...

48
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,888
...Station. And I had to send Ray.
So I'm all by myself.

49
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,863
No... no.

50
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,062
...There's no problem.
I need to make it earlier.

51
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,328
Gabe?

52
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,328
It's up to you.

53
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,196
- Oh, ten thirty's good.
- Are you ready?

54
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,999
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

55
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,472
Alright, I'll meet you outside.

56
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,308
Alright, I'll see you then.

57
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,105
Good morning.

58
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:17,078
Hey.

59
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,475
Is your brother up yet?

60
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,584
Yeah, I think so.

61
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,050
You wanna have a bagel or something?

62
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:25,745
Naw, I'm good.

63
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,922
Okay. Don't forget the propane today.

64
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,088
Yeah, I know.

65
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,357
Pete, come on. Get up.

66
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:37,833
Pete.

67
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,834
Wake up. Come on. Need some help?

68
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,497
Here, try smelling that.

69
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,100
You should try
washing 'em once in a while.

70
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,540
Come on. You've had your sleep.

71
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,211
Listen, I can't drive you this morning.

72
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,043
So you've gotta get going.
You're gonna be late. Okay?

73
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,081
Okay.

74
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,611
You're gonna wear this stuff?

75
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,321
Now you're gonna need this
for your regions exam. Remember...

76
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,331
...the quadratic formula is:

77
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,436
X equals...

78
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,096
...negative B plus or minus...

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,731
...the radical of B squared...

80
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,071
...minus 4 AC...

81
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,840
...over 2 A.

82
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,347
Everybody write this down
and commit it to memory you...

83
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,711
...will need it.

84
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,011
Pete!

85
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,681
Out, please?

86
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:06,956
Thank you.

87
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:16,765
Oh, Pete.

88
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:17,334
Yeah?

89
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,299
Um...

90
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,029
...Mister Austin told me
to tell you that

91
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,799
he doesn't want to see you today.

92
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,299
Really?

93
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,773
Yeah. Apparently.

94
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,408
So, I'm supposed to go back to class?

95
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:28,535
Ah, no...

96
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,443
...actually. He didn't say that either.

97
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,248
So?

98
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,980
So, you're just supposed to sit there
for the rest of the day until detention.

99
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,647
And um... think about your life.

100
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,120
My life?

101
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,694
Yeah, that's what he said.

102
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,129
What about it?

103
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,292
You know he wasn't very specific
about that, actually.

104
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:54,997
Um, but perhaps. Maybe you could
just free associate a bit...

105
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,697
...you know? Ummm...

106
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:01,779
I do that, and ahh...
it helps me. Just...

107
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:03,847
...you know center and just breathe.

108
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,533
What's going on, boss?

109
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:07,667
What's happening?

110
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,444
Do you have any shifts
you don't need next week?

111
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,240
Why?

112
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,079
I was looking to take on a couple extra.

113
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,778
I thought you might have
a few you don't need.

114
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,223
Why?

115
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,891
Extra shifts, extra money.

116
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,495
Are you alright?

117
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,064
Yeah.

118
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,063
You already work like, six days.

119
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,930
Yeah, I wanna pick up some doubles.

120
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,037
Why?

121
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:38,839
Help me out.

122
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,313
Ah, yeah. You can have Friday.

123
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,015
Yeah? Alright.

124
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,780
Thanks man.

125
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,854
Gabe"z".

126
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,593
Fuckin' weirdo.

127
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,493
Thanks, Sport.

128
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,151
We're all done, Bill.

129
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,227
Thanks, Jim.

130
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,955
Why don't you go wash up.

131
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,099
They grow up pretty fast... huh?

132
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,169
How are your guys doing?

133
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,333
Good, I guess. Yeah.

134
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:43,432
How you doing otherwise?

135
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,376
Good.
You know the season's just starting.

136
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:48,479
So it's all good.

137
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,908
Jim, did you ever meet Sue's friend,
Elaine?

138
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,549
From the hair salon on thirty three?

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,618
I don't get down
to the hair salon all that much. No.

140
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,993
No, she's been to some
of the games with us.

141
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:03,859
No.

142
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,128
You know me, I wouldn't ah...

143
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,561
I just thought you might like
to meet her. You know?

144
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,331
Yeah. No, I appreciate it.

145
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,597
But...

146
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:25,415
It's okay. Listen, say hi
to your guys for us. Okay?

147
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,812
I will. I will.

148
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,185
Are you staying for dinner?

149
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,957
I told you, I can't tonight.

150
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,465
Alright, alright...

151
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:51,564
Stace.

152
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:52,499
Hey, Jim.

153
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,406
You hook up the tank?

154
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:01,236
Hmm?

155
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,846
Did you hook up the tank.

156
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,082
Naw, I didn't get around to it yet.

157
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,541
Why didn't you do it
before you showered?

158
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,483
Because Pete's supposed to help me,
and he's nowhere to be found.

159
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,315
Well, what's Pete got to do with it?

160
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,626
What Pete has to do with it is,
it's his job.

161
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,193
And he's supposed to help me.

162
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,455
We talked about this, this morning.

163
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,088
We all do equal amount
of work around here.

164
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,594
You ever lift one of those things
by yourself?

165
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,958
Yeah, about six hundred times.

166
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,593
The thing weighs like ninety pounds.

167
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:28,399
Well, why didn't you get Stacy
to help you?

168
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,741
Because it's not Stacy's job to help me.
It's Pete's job to help me.

169
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,563
You guys busy on Sunday?

170
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,429
I don't think so.

171
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,768
'Cause I was thinking we could um...

172
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,376
...drive out to Allaire
and rent a boat or something.

173
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,847
I've gotta see about work.

174
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,419
Yeah, I gotta see about some stuff too.

175
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:32,431
Well you know, it's okay guys,
we don't have to hang out. You know.

176
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,366
Really?

177
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,474
Well, you don't have to get so excited
about it. If I'm not cool enough.

178
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:37,165
That's not it.

179
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,105
Oh really? Then what is it?

180
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,538
What? You think you're cooler than me?

181
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,375
Well, I do better cutlet breading.

182
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,484
No.

183
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,519
Hey, the salt in this breading
is crushing me, man.

184
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:50,986
I'll tell you what.

185
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,386
When you cook, don't use it. Okay?

186
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,583
- Amen.
- I don't.

187
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:55,215
Good.

188
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,190
I leave it on the table.

189
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:56,918
Good for you, Pete.

190
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,086
Salt is an option.

191
00:14:58,229 --> 00:14:59,491
You cook bland.

192
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,258
I delicately season, yes.

193
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,026
I can't even taste it when you cook it.

194
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,430
Whatever.

195
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,066
You fear seasoning.
It's an issue you have to deal with.

196
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,197
Okay.

197
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:10,637
I'll spice it up for you.

198
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,140
Go ahead. I'm not gonna eat it anyway.

199
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,515
I'm gonna get a little juice
to counteract the saltiness.

200
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,111
Oh ah, Pete.

201
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,187
I got a letter
from your school about a...

202
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,118
...parent teacher meeting
on Friday night.

203
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,365
Okay.

204
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:38,700
I'm just letting you know.

205
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,405
Mister Winters? Come on in.

206
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,006
Have a seat.

207
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:37,225
Well, as you probably know,
Mister Winters.

208
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,762
I'm just Pete's History teacher.

209
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:45,029
But I've spoken with his other teachers,
and with Vice Principle Austin. And...

210
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,660
...we sort of felt that since

211
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,365
I was the only teacher Pete
seems connected to...

212
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,941
...that I should be having this talk
with you.

213
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:55,939
Okay, yeah.

214
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,907
Ah, well first... ah...

215
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,985
Pete will have
to go to summer school again.

216
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,845
I know you've heard this before.

217
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:08,755
Looking back at his record,
I see that he was left back in umm...

218
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,588
Pete was not left back.

219
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:18,065
He was away from school for a while,
so he lost some time.

220
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,666
But he was not left back.

221
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:30,243
Mister Winters, we don't think
there's anything wrong with Pete.

222
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:36,447
It's just no telling when he'll try,
and when he won't. It's like he umm...

223
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,185
Well, we don't know what.

224
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,320
It must be very frustrating.

225
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,451
For you as well.

226
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,171
Come on, Robbie!

227
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,999
He's confusing me!

228
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:02,813
Nice.

229
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,816
You see him?

230
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,157
What's the score?

231
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,052
Seven to five.

232
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,262
Hey Mister Winters.

233
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,172
Hey Robbie. How are ya?

234
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,376
Okay, thanks.

235
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,543
What's up?

236
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,423
We need to talk.

237
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,656
I'll be home a little later.

238
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,723
We need to talk now.

239
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,533
We have next game.

240
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,562
I think we need to do it now, Pete.

241
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:07,044
Later Dude.

242
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:18,185
I'll be back, Dude.

243
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,153
Okay, man.

244
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,306
What is up?

245
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,943
When is this gonna end?

246
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:41,970
What?

247
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,147
You have to finish high school. Okay?

248
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,716
Then you can do what you want.

249
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:50,385
I understand that your life is your own.
Okay? But you have to finish.

250
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,112
Have to?

251
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,747
Yes, you have to.
There's nothing wrong with your brain.

252
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,154
There's nothing wrong
with your hearing aid.

253
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,262
What the fuck does my hearing aid have
to do with anything?

254
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,693
When does this crap...

255
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,629
Are we done?

256
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,340
Can I go?

257
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,040
Just finish, Pete.

258
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,341
Can I go?

259
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,876
Yeah.

260
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,208
Hey, Bob.

261
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,369
Hey, Mister Winters.

262
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,571
What's up?

263
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,612
Well, that lady down
at the Wentworth's needs a hand truck,

264
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,047
or some kind of dolly.

265
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,947
She's asking about a hand truck.

266
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,784
And I suggested like a dolly.

267
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,424
I'm pretty sure you have a hand truck.

268
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,353
Yeah, fine.

269
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:35,124
Hey, wouldn't you guys rather help,
than just...

270
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,487
...stare at me all day?

271
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:41,827
Seems kinda boring,
just sitting there staring.

272
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,960
Looking tough.

273
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,932
How about some cookies?

274
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,743
Or cash! There could be cash in it
for you guys.

275
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,675
For some reason,
cash doesn't work with them.

276
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,337
Alright, now we're talking.

277
00:21:58,716 --> 00:21:59,705
Thank you.

278
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,585
Yeah, it's the...

279
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,414
...local gang.

280
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,613
A gang who refuses cash!

281
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:10,452
Yeah well, I would accept the cash.
Actually, I'd help you for nothing.

282
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,995
But ah... I'm really busy today
and I can't. So...

283
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,326
Oh no, no, no. That's fine.
This will definitely help.

284
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,195
But I could help you get this on.

285
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,199
Thank you.

286
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,369
I'm Molly Ripken.

287
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,573
Ah... Jim Winters.
I just live down the block.

288
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,910
Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:42,225
So you're umm...

290
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,586
You're house sitting.

291
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,321
A favor for an old friend. Yeah.

292
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:57,031
House sitting. Plant watering.
Various other things I imagine.

293
00:22:58,743 --> 00:22:59,869
Lawn cutting...

294
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,244
Right.

295
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,377
Anyway, which house is yours
so I know where to return it.

296
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:09,577
Number forty seven. It's about
a block and a half down there.

297
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,517
Alright,
I'll get this right back to you.

298
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,420
Hey, no rush. No problem. Okay?

299
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:15,991
Thanks.

300
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,462
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

301
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,355
So listen, we gotta have a talk here.

302
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,667
Why's that?

303
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:02,763
It's a... a decision I made.

304
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,042
What's that?

305
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,206
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

306
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:15,277
Leaving?

307
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,153
Yeah.

308
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,657
What, you mean you're moving out
and getting your own place?

309
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:26,053
Ah...

310
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:31,031
Actually I'm leaving town.
I'm going to go to Tampa.

311
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:34,331
Stay with... Brian for a while.
And maybe get a place down there.

312
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:39,900
Why?

313
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,150
I don't know, exactly.

314
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,681
You're leaving town,
and you don't have a reason?

315
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:51,412
No, I have reasons for it.

316
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:52,647
Well what's your reason?

317
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:55,922
Where do you think you're going?

318
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,890
This is between you two.

319
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,996
I want you to sit down over there,
Pete. Pete!

320
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,825
Pete, get back in here and sit down!

321
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,364
Hey, take it easy!

322
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,975
Why didn't you talk to me?

323
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,075
Gabe?

324
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,175
Why didn't you talk to me?

325
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,784
What about Stacy?

326
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:30,951
That's my problem,
and I'm dealing with it.

327
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,156
And what are you going to do in Tampa?

328
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:39,868
Well, Brian says he can get me a job
on his uncle's boat.

329
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm gonna do that and get a place.

330
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:45,068
See what happens.

331
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,979
You're going to work on a boat.

332
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,648
Yeah. I am.

333
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,583
Look, I've been thinking...
about this for a long time.

334
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,286
It's got nothing to do with you.

335
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,228
It's...

336
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,131
I think you should sit down Gabe.
And we... should talk about this.

337
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:13,293
No. There's nothing to talk about.

338
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:15,132
I think there's plenty to talk about.

339
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,671
I want you to sit down
and I want to discuss this.

340
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:17,603
I don't wanna sit down and discuss it.

341
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,039
I want you to sit down
so that we can talk about this!

342
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,404
No, no! Listen... to me!

343
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,604
There's nothing to discuss!
Okay. I'm gonna get the money together.

344
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,842
And them I'm leaving. It's a plan.
It's settled.

345
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,553
You know, every day this place
just looks a little worse to me.

346
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,697
I just...
I can't get anything started here.

347
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,274
You know.

348
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:32,883
I'll be fine.

349
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,974
Can I see that soda a sec?

350
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:24,585
What?

351
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:26,449
Dude, I'm not doing anything.

352
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,852
Good. Because I'm not dealing with
this tonight.

353
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,924
I'm know.

354
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,485
Alright, cool.

355
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,628
Cool.

356
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,531
Hey Bender!

357
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:42,264
How's it going, man?

358
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,972
It's Good. Good.

359
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,141
What's going on?

360
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,138
I'm awesome.

361
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,569
Good to hear it.

362
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:51,645
Just drive. Okay?

363
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:55,146
Dude, I'm fine.

364
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:56,675
Yeah, what's up... man?

365
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,048
Oh nothing, man.

366
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:06,785
Don't fuckin' go anywhere, man!

367
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,954
I'm right here, Dude!

368
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,190
Get in the fuckin' car, asshole.

369
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,698
I'll be right here, man!

370
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,565
You fucking pussy!

371
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,338
Fuck, dude! Fuck!

372
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:29,749
Ah, dude.

373
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,548
Over some stupid girl. You happy?

374
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,384
No. My fucking eye!

375
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,832
Pete?

376
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:44,763
Yeah?

377
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,631
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

378
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,495
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

379
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,171
Let me have a look.

380
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,508
Why?

381
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:56,207
Just because I wanna have a look.

382
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,437
- Dad, I'm fine.
- Come on, come here.

383
00:31:58,582 --> 00:31:59,344
Dad, I'm fine.

384
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:03,817
Come here, under the light.
Just for asecond. Come on. Come here.

385
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:06,015
Okay, put your head up. Let me see.

386
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,025
In the light.

387
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:18,033
Okay, move your eye to the left.
To the right. Okay, hang on a second.

388
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:21,233
A piece of gravel or something. Okay.

389
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,230
There's one more there.

390
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,374
Okay.

391
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:32,276
Is that it?

392
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,681
Yeah. Okay, yeah. I think so.

393
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:39,311
You okay?

394
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,447
Alright.

395
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:46,886
Get some sleep. Alright?

396
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,141
Hello?

397
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,582
Hi.

398
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,554
Hi?

399
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:19,218
Do you live here?

400
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:20,461
No.

401
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:23,093
I was just trying to return... this...

402
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:24,325
Hey Pete!

403
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,431
What?

404
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:26,934
Someone's here to see you!

405
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,463
Okay.

406
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:42,651
Hi. I'm Molly Ripken.
I'm house sitting down the street.

407
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:47,981
What's your name?

408
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:49,950
Pete Winters.

409
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:55,664
Umm... I borrowed this...
from your dad. And...

410
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,824
...just returning it,
and wanted to thank him.

411
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:02,204
Or you too, I guess. So, thanks.

412
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:05,135
Okay, you could just leave it.

413
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:07,635
Oh. Okay.

414
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,283
Are your parents home, actually?

415
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,418
I think my dad's working. I'm not sure.

416
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,920
Well, what about your mom?

417
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,032
Maybe I can help you?

418
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:44,373
Well, I just wanted to invite
your family for dinner.

419
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,275
Actually... to thank you.

420
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:53,280
I don't know a lot of people here
so I'm just trying to,

421
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:57,086
you know... get to know people.

422
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:00,894
You can come too, if you want.

423
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:06,935
Well, thanks.
I'll let me dad know. Okay?

424
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:11,406
Yeah, you can let me know
what night's good for you.

425
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,666
Yeah. Thanks again.

426
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:17,436
Nice meeting you. Both.

427
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:21,041
Bye.

428
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:22,609
Bye.

429
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,594
See what I have to deal with here?
This fucking nut house.

430
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:55,143
Gabe"z".

431
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:56,580
Hey. What's up man?

432
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:57,911
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

433
00:35:59,256 --> 00:35:59,847
Hello.

434
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,922
Hello.

435
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:02,149
How's evening shift?

436
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,384
Alright.

437
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,085
What are you up to?

438
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:09,222
What are you guys doing?

439
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,531
Trying to rent a movie.

440
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,697
Bernie told me
about this big party in Clinton?

441
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:22,208
Yeah, probably not tonight, man.
You know? Just doing our thing.

442
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,806
Well, fucking Barry is on me
about next month's schedule.

443
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,009
So, If you could just finalize
that tomorrow?

444
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,452
Yeah, I ahh...

445
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,358
I'm actually not going to be
on the schedule for next month.

446
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:40,127
Why not?

447
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:43,229
I'm like, moving.

448
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,559
I'm going to Florida.
Like leaving town. So...

449
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:50,239
Wow.

450
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:51,505
Yeah.

451
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:06,014
You're like just getting up and going?
Just fucking doing it?

452
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:09,714
Yep.

453
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,653
Are you going too?

454
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:19,760
Alright well, I should head.

455
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,266
Do you guys want the rest of this?

456
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,463
Get outta here.

457
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,135
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.

458
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:49,924
What do you think of these?

459
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,932
I think they're a little overgrown.

460
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:55,937
Yeah, I think you're right.

461
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,631
Oh listen, before I forget.

462
00:37:57,774 --> 00:38:00,038
We're having dinner
with Molly Ripken on Wednesday night.

463
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,205
Who?

464
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:02,003
You know, Molly Ripken.

465
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:03,874
You know,
she's house sitting for the Wentworths.

466
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:05,110
Oh.

467
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:10,151
She doesn't know anyone.
She's... you know... she's new.

468
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,112
So?

469
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,892
So... So, we're gonna go there
and have dinner Wednesday night.

470
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,556
Why do I have to go?

471
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:20,493
Because you were invited.

472
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:22,928
Well, why don't you just go.

473
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,525
Because we were all invited.

474
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,933
I already talked to Pete
and we're just gonna go. Okay?

475
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,730
I'm working Wednesday.

476
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,068
Yeah, you've got the day shift.
You can be home by six thirty.

477
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,440
Take a shower,
and meet me and Pete by seven.

478
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:37,203
Are you serious?

479
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,404
Yeah, I'm serious.

480
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:39,546
You really think...

481
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:41,776
..."what's-her-name" wants me and Pete
to come to dinner with her?

482
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:44,216
Gabe, we are gonna have dinner.
With Molly Ripken...

483
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:47,380
...Wednesday at seven.
Live it and breath it, Gabe. Okay?

484
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,649
Alright.

485
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,094
You know, it's not like
I ask you to do a lot of stuff.

486
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:56,961
- Alright?
- Alright.

487
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,089
Fine.

488
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,700
These are good.

489
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,038
Yeah.

490
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:17,678
We're gonna take a look at history
through its contextual perspectives.

491
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:21,484
Which is a rather opaque
but very impressive way of saying,

492
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,356
that if history is a story. And it is.

493
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:31,657
We're gonna ask ourselves...
why are they telling it?

494
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:34,169
Who's telling that story?

495
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:35,630
Who are they telling it to?

496
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:40,038
And how does... that story change itself,
modify itself over time?

497
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,508
That's all part of history.

498
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,707
I'm sorry. Wha... What's your name?

499
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:46,408
Pete Winters.

500
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:55,619
Pete... Pete Winters?

501
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:56,748
Yep.

502
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:03,466
Oh yeah. Okay. Here you go.
Ah... we get started at nine thirty.

503
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:04,729
Sorry.

504
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:06,130
So I'm sure you'll wanna get here then

505
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,329
so you don't...
you don't miss anything.

506
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,937
Umm... could you do me a favor?

507
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,079
What's that?

508
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:21,848
Could you sit a little closer?

509
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:23,917
Why?

510
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:26,950
I don't know exactly.

511
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,421
Well, shouldn't my seat be my choice?

512
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,125
Just asking.

513
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,526
How about this one?

514
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,910
Okay, let's look at Mongolia.

515
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:03,914
Fucks...

516
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:08,214
You little mother fuckers.

517
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:40,583
Hey.

518
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,554
Hi.

519
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,918
Welcome. Come on in.

520
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:45,594
Thanks.

521
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:55,334
Ah... I'm sorry. My boys are not gonna
be able to make it.

522
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,498
They were... They were busy.
So they couldn't come.

523
00:42:58,641 --> 00:42:59,699
That's fine.

524
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,333
They send their apologies.

525
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,343
I know you've probably made food
for four.

526
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,572
And now there's just two. But...

527
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:05,612
It's okay.

528
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,351
More for us. Can I get you a drink?

529
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:13,013
Ah... ah... Water would be fine.

530
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:14,088
- Okay.
- Thanks.

531
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,359
Please don't tell me
you're a vegetarian.

532
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,624
Naw.

533
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:27,431
Thank you.

534
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,596
I make a lot of chicken dishes.

535
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:34,866
But I know a lot of sauces.
I like to experiment.

536
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:39,971
I made a Moroccan sauce.

537
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:43,779
It's not too spicy. But...

538
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,785
That's um... That's great.

539
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:56,723
Oh Jim.

540
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,163
Don't worry about that.

541
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:59,325
No, no. I... I...

542
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:03,132
Well, they're not coming
so there's no point in... in having it.

543
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,872
Should we put those away?

544
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,079
Okay.

545
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:27,790
Where shall I put them?

546
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:31,859
The people that you're dealing with,
they have ideas.

547
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:32,899
And you have ideas.

548
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:34,901
And you put them together
and you kind of...

549
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:38,064
you create... you create this...
this garden...

550
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,039
...together.
It sounds like bullshit but...

551
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:43,907
No, that's a beautiful way
to describe what you do.

552
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:47,813
You obviously love what you do.
And that's...

553
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:51,150
Then, you know,
there's the maintenance part of it.

554
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:52,549
You have to...

555
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,988
...which in some ways...
is even more important.

556
00:44:56,125 --> 00:45:01,859
Because gardens fall apart very quickly.
You really have to take care of them.

557
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,660
It sounds like a great business.

558
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:12,632
You umm... Seems umm...
You're here for how long?

559
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:14,106
Three months.

560
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:16,711
So you just kind of
packed up your whole life

561
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:19,713
and you come here for three months?

562
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:24,781
I happen to be in between jobs and...

563
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:26,021
What do you do?

564
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,615
I'm a para-legal.

565
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:29,789
Oh.

566
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,891
Yes I am.

567
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,431
And I just...

568
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:44,063
You know what,
I just needed a change of address.

569
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,903
You're not running from the law
or something?

570
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,971
I don't know. I'm just...

571
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:56,811
That's how I make a living.
But that's not what I love to do.

572
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,042
And umm...

573
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,856
I wanted to explore the other side
of things for a while.

574
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,125
I'm a bit of an artist, myself.

575
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,924
Really?

576
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,534
What, like painting? Or...

577
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:15,434
No, umm... No.

578
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:21,742
I'll tell you what. I will show you
what I do after dinner.

579
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:25,881
Okay.

580
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:31,278
It's beautiful.

581
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,754
How long you been doing this?

582
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:37,189
A long time.

583
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:40,119
Since high school, I guess.

584
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,964
I wish I could make a living with it.
But...

585
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:48,135
Every now and then
I sell something.

586
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:54,602
I guess it's a very competitive world.
Right?

587
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,611
Oh, there are a lot of jewelers
out there.

588
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,209
Yeah. But it's beautiful.

589
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,286
I mean, the details.
It's really amazing.

590
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:10,590
Thank you.

591
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,143
Can I get you some more coffee?

592
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,284
Amm... No. Actually I have to go.

593
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:44,090
Oh, okay.

594
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,819
I have a really busy day tomorrow.

595
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:49,159
And I gotta get a jump start on it.
So...

596
00:47:49,298 --> 00:47:50,788
Sure. Thanks for coming over.

597
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,466
No Thank... dinner was great. Thank you.

598
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,034
Tell your boys,
I'm sorry they missed it.

599
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:57,068
I will.

600
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:58,730
That's okay. I'll let myself out.

601
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,899
- Okay.
- Alright, thanks.

602
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,203
- Good night.
- Good night.

603
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,651
Pete.

604
00:49:58,227 --> 00:49:59,524
Pete?

605
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,027
What the fuck did you do?

606
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:08,203
What the fuck did you do?
I didn't do shit!

607
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,332
Well, what is this?

608
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:15,808
Why are our beds on the lawn?

609
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,080
The fucking...

610
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,410
...missed that dinner with
that fucking woman down the block.

611
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,817
Did you try the back door?

612
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,617
Yes. I tried every fucking thing.
It's fucking locked.

613
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,338
I'm sleeping!

614
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:51,207
I can see that.

615
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:53,637
Comfy?

616
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,877
Shut up!

617
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:02,758
Wow.

618
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,718
Dad has lost his mind.

619
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:11,459
He's a complete maniac.

620
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:05,120
It's not here.

621
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:07,882
Dude, how could you get a paper
without a sports section.

622
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,219
Only got a Florida sports section.
I don't know.

623
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:11,819
Oh, dude.

624
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:15,556
Yo, why don't you go see
if he'll trade?

625
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:17,097
Why don't you go ask him?
What brought this on?

626
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,097
Me?

627
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,134
You just... I don't like him, man.

628
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,170
Why? He's not gonna bite you.
Just go ask him for the paper.

629
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,204
I didn't do the homework.

630
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,739
Oh man. God!

631
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:37,113
Hey. Ah... do you think
we could trade papers?

632
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:38,484
What for?

633
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:40,418
We need that one for the scores.

634
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:42,922
Oh. Is that today's?

635
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,549
Yeah. Yeah it is.

636
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,187
You mind if I finish my article?

637
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,530
No. Go ahead.

638
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:53,959
Alright.

639
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,271
Have a seat.

640
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:58,130
Oh no, I'm good.

641
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:19,791
You could'a done it. He likes you.

642
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:52,753
Damn, what took so long?

643
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:53,987
Did he make you buy it or something?

644
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:10,444
Hey Stace. It's me again.

645
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:16,811
Just wondering where you are, again.
I don't know.

646
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:18,419
I keep calling you
and you're not calling me back.

647
00:54:18,554 --> 00:54:19,851
So...

648
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:24,322
Just call me back, please.
When you can.

649
00:54:27,997 --> 00:54:29,328
I figured you'd at least
want to say good bye.

650
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:31,899
Even if you didn't feel
like hanging out anymore. So...

651
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:38,000
just get back to me.
Alright, good bye.

652
00:54:58,694 --> 00:54:59,422
What's up man?

653
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:00,657
What's up?

654
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,123
What you know?

655
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,436
You alright?

656
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,730
Good. Good.

657
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:10,536
Good.

658
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:11,971
I hear you're leaving town.

659
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,098
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:16,076
Cool.

661
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:22,110
So listen man,
where's your sister been?

662
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:25,713
Just around, I guess.

663
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:27,917
Well, she's not really...

664
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:31,493
...'cause I been to your house.
I been to school.

665
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:34,824
I been leaving her messages.

666
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,560
You been giving 'em to her?

667
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:39,660
Some of 'em.

668
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,470
Come on man.
How many times I buy you beer?

669
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,370
Can you help me out here?

670
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,879
Sorry man. I don't know.

671
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,288
You want me to camp out
on your front yard and wait for her?

672
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:16,200
Hey there.

673
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:17,302
Hey Stacy.

674
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:20,899
Gabe's still at work.

675
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,510
I know. I just umm...

676
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:27,680
wanted to return some of your stuff,
for Gabe. I guess.

677
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:28,540
- Oh cool.
- I don't know,

678
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:30,117
I think some of it's yours.

679
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,388
Alright.

680
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,022
Nice.

681
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,259
Look at this.

682
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:49,635
How long have you had this?

683
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:54,141
I told you about that a million times.
You never came by to get it.

684
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:58,640
Hey... you still owe me a game,
you know.

685
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:07,519
You and Gabe still not talking?

686
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:10,983
It's better this way.

687
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:14,462
I mean, there's really not much to say.

688
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:17,387
So...

689
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:26,271
You know you're welcome here anytime.
We'd love to see ya.

690
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:32,905
Definitely. I'll be around to say hello.

691
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:36,918
That'd be great.

692
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:39,977
Well, I'd better get going.

693
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:41,778
Take care.

694
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,434
...end of the spring, 1238

695
00:57:57,573 --> 00:57:59,438
have conquered most issue in Europe

696
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:02,305
Hungry, having just crossed
into Austria.

697
00:58:02,444 --> 00:58:04,605
The Mongols decided not to press on

698
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,706
and basically roll up the rest
of Europe like a carpet.

699
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:14,812
But turn around and go back home.
Anybody know why?

700
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:17,318
Rebecca?

701
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,092
Don't feel bad. It's considered...

702
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:23,027
...one of the strangest
events in all of military history.

703
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,831
The Mongolian army,

704
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:28,766
greatest most efficient
army ever been seen...

705
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:31,065
...was about to take Europe.
But they didn't.

706
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,334
Hey, you know why?

707
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:42,073
What if I gave you the day off
if you could tell me the answer?

708
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:44,281
You will?

709
00:58:46,388 --> 00:58:47,377
Why? Do you know?

710
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,993
The strategy guys
couldn't agree on where to go next.

711
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,593
Okay, that's part of it.

712
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:56,991
What's the main thing?

713
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,592
They found out their leader died.

714
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:05,997
Alright. Off you go.

715
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:27,319
They found out their leader died.
Genghis Khan. And with that...

716
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,441
Hey.

717
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,612
Hey, what's up?

718
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,774
Nothing.

719
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:51,676
What, no school?

720
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:53,648
Naw, I was released early.

721
00:59:57,926 --> 00:59:58,824
You work tonight?

722
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,826
Ahh... naw. Just packin'.

723
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:12,195
Cool.

724
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:04,722
Hey.

725
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:06,891
Hey.

726
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,427
What are you doing?

727
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:10,897
Nothing.

728
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:13,826
That's the stuff, right?

729
01:02:13,962 --> 01:02:16,328
Yeah. Yeah.

730
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,537
So, Florida. Huh?

731
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:30,541
Yeah.

732
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,150
You know what
I was thinking the other day?

733
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:38,050
What?

734
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,780
You don't know anything about Florida.

735
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:44,919
I mean, you don't. Do you?

736
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:47,726
No.

737
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:50,320
That's what I thought.

738
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:53,466
I'll tell you though.

739
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:56,327
I'll bet Brian lives
in the most boring city there.

740
01:02:57,005 --> 01:02:57,937
Probably, yeah.

741
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:01,601
It'll be warm though.

742
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:17,786
Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.

743
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:30,398
So, let's dive!

744
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,267
Hey.

745
01:04:01,136 --> 01:04:02,228
What are you doing?

746
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:04,535
I'm just going through some stuff.

747
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,938
Well, it's getting late.
Maybe you should finish up tomorrow.

748
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:11,613
No, I'll clean up.

749
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,600
Where'd you find this?

750
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:34,659
It was under the stairs over there.

751
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,711
This was her stuff.

752
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:49,675
You can't take this.

753
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:55,245
Why not?

754
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:01,222
Because it belongs here.

755
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,328
Says who?

756
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:13,039
Says me.

757
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:29,320
Hey, you'd better clean that stuff off.

758
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,656
There was dust all over it!

759
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:09,120
Hey.

760
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:10,094
Hey.

761
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:11,563
Nice night.

762
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:13,299
It's beautiful

763
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:15,295
So, this is where everyone hangs out?

764
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:18,872
Yeah, it's kind
of like the local community center.

765
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,075
You wanna get in?

766
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:23,836
Sure.

767
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:41,258
So, how's the ah...
how's the town treating ya?

768
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:44,522
I've actually made a few friends.

769
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,096
- Really?
- Yeah.

770
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:47,792
That's good.

771
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:48,868
Nice.

772
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,743
No.

773
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,309
- No.
- No. I've...

774
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:08,012
I've never been married.

775
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:16,287
I was engaged once.
But it just didn't work out.

776
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:21,627
Well, I'm sorry about that.

777
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:22,702
No, don't be.

778
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,274
'Cause it would have been
a huge mistake.

779
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:41,551
I was married.
Well I haven't been now for five years.

780
01:07:46,995 --> 01:07:51,193
My wife died ah... in an accident
just ah... south of town.

781
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:56,495
Well, I'm sorry.

782
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:00,039
Yeah. Me too.

783
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:14,454
She was picking up my youngest son
from baseball practice.

784
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,122
On the way home,
she was at an intersection.

785
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,219
And there was this guy,
he was coming the other way.

786
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:27,865
And he was trying to...
Trying to beat a yellow light.

787
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:32,164
But it was raining.
And he changed his mind.

788
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:41,943
And so he tried to stop.
But it was too late.

789
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,784
The car went into a skid and just...

790
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:46,987
...skidded right through
the intersection.

791
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:52,492
And he slammed into my wife's car.
She...

792
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:56,556
...she died on the way to the hospital.

793
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:02,364
And ahh...
I never got to speak to her again.

794
01:09:14,215 --> 01:09:20,154
You know it could have been...
It could have been worse.

795
01:09:21,623 --> 01:09:26,287
You know. I mean, thank God you know,
Pete... Pete made it through it.

796
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:29,992
Was he okay? Was he...?

797
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:32,929
Yeah. He's okay, more or less.

798
01:09:40,608 --> 01:09:41,836
You know it's really weird.

799
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:46,508
Sometimes when I'm concentrating
on something really hard,

800
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:52,252
or in the morning
just as I'm waking up;

801
01:09:54,889 --> 01:10:01,658
I forget, just for a second.
But I forget.

802
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,341
You know,
it's this really strange thing,

803
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,911
where everything that you've built
your life on...

804
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:21,812
everything that you think you are.

805
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,718
Is just gone.

806
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,650
It's just gone.

807
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:56,403
Gabe, you got some mail.

808
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:58,210
Okay.

809
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:02,374
Do you have a forwarding address
for Brian yet?

810
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:04,212
Yeah, I took care of it. Thanks.

811
01:12:07,755 --> 01:12:08,653
Do you want a hand with that?

812
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:09,950
No, I got it.

813
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:11,653
No, it's kind of difficult.
You have to...

814
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:13,590
...push it down here on that plate.

815
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:14,790
I got it. It's bent.

816
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:17,420
Yeah, I know.
That's why you have to un...

817
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:18,357
Damn it!

818
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,467
Sorry.

819
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:21,090
Are you alright?

820
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:25,602
Just go inside.

821
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:32,039
Don't talk to me that way.
Just remember where you are.

822
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:36,477
Sorry, what?

823
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:39,850
What did you say?

824
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:41,153
Forget it.

825
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,318
Oh no, "forget it." What did you say?
Why don't you just say it.

826
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,791
I know what you're thinking.

827
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:48,552
This town is for losers! Right?

828
01:12:48,696 --> 01:12:49,526
I never thought that.

829
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:51,564
Well that's how you act.

830
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,599
You promised that you would try
and work things out here.

831
01:12:53,735 --> 01:12:54,633
I did try to work things out here.

832
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:56,134
It doesn't really look like it.

833
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,104
Do you know how hard it is for me
to make all of this work?

834
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,004
Well, you think it's easy for me?
I don't want to do it anymore!

835
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:04,976
Who's asking you to?
Huh? Who is asking?

836
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:07,775
You've had your eye on the door
ever since your mother died!

837
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,008
Oh bullshit! That's a fucking lie!

838
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,845
And you know what?
It's not my fault that she's gone.

839
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:12,646
I never said it was your fault!

840
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:14,781
You ever thing for two seconds that
maybe I have to go

841
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,790
and do something for myself?
For once! For my life?

842
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,922
And what are you gonna do?
You're gonna go live on Brian's couch?

843
01:13:20,061 --> 01:13:22,052
Yeah! Brian's couch!
Something for me for a change!

844
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:22,993
For my life!

845
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:24,758
No, no, no. This is your life!

846
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:26,264
Go inside!

847
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,699
Don't you ever talk to me that way!

848
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:44,896
Hey!

849
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:49,396
How are you?

850
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:51,060
Good.

851
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,230
It's beautiful today.

852
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:54,404
Yeah.

853
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,503
What are you up to?

854
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:00,337
I'm taking the boys
out to dinner tonight.

855
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:02,606
Nice.

856
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:08,787
Hey.

857
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,027
I'd like to see you again.

858
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,191
Can I call you?

859
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:19,759
Sure. You gotta pen?

860
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:25,265
Not... on me.

861
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:29,432
Maybe just drop by then.

862
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,273
I'll do that.

863
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:38,749
See you later.

864
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:40,317
See ya.

865
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,730
Would you umm... pass me your spoon.
The took mine away or something.

866
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:01,736
- That was good.
- Yeah.

867
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:02,808
Thank you.

868
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,543
So I'm wondering
why Miss Ripken wasn't invited.

869
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:07,544
'Cause I know
she likes dinner with the family.

870
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:09,444
You are such a smart ass.

871
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,950
Here's your... cake smart ass.

872
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:15,920
I feel like a jerk now.
That's beautiful... Thank you.

873
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,593
Good luck, Gabe. Alright.

874
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:21,619
You have to cut it.

875
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:22,490
I'm gonna. Should we...

876
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,120
- Do you want to do the honors?
- Yes.

877
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:25,755
No, no, you have to cut it.

878
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:26,924
Me?

879
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:28,797
It's like tradition...
you gotta cut the cake.

880
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:30,403
You don't want me to pass...
pass the torch?

881
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:31,664
You've gotta cut it,
so you can make the wish.

882
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:33,296
- It's your nickel.
- Good Luck Gabe

883
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:35,799
Give me the first piece.

884
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:37,501
You get the luck piece. Alright?

885
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:39,303
Let's see, what do we want here?

886
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,712
I want a lot of frosting.

887
01:18:40,848 --> 01:18:41,837
Okay.

888
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:52,891
Hey.

889
01:18:53,027 --> 01:18:53,721
Hey.

890
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:55,784
I thought you were asleep.

891
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,158
Naw.

892
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,188
Pete?

893
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:00,591
Yeah, I think so.

894
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,900
Yeah, you let him drink wine
with dinner he passes right out.

895
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:09,070
You got a spare one of those?

896
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:26,184
What time you leaving tomorrow?

897
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:28,293
I'm thinking like six thirty.

898
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:30,756
Getting an early start, huh?

899
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:32,332
Yeah.

900
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:34,860
That's good.

901
