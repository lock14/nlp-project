John Weiner steps in.



He bunts, third base side.
Pitcher's only play is first base.



And he throws the ball away.



Son-of-a-bitch.



He's gonna try for three.
And the relay throw...



...is not in time!



I can't watch like this.



What are you doing?



One second.



What are you doing to my TV?



One second.



What are you doing?



Move your head.



I want...



...Please.
- Oh you, goof ball.



I said move. I watching the game.



Alright.



Alright?



Come on. Yeah hit me.



Hey!



I said move.



Dude!



I'll make you eat this thing.



Okay.



What about the ivy?



Ah... leave it 'til last.



It's first off this morning.



Hey there.



Good morning.



Good morning.



Getting busy, I guess.



Um-hmm.



Is Gabe driving you today?



Yeah, is he late?



Well, you'd better check.



Gabe?



Alright.
Just give me a minute, alright?



Yep.



Pete.



Pete, are you up?



He's up. Stop it.



Fine Dude! I'm up. God!



You're sure now?



- Yes!
- Okay.



Hey.



How you doin'?



Oh, I'm crazy this afternoon. Umm...



...Station. And I had to send Ray.
So I'm all by myself.



No... no.



...There's no problem.
I need to make it earlier.



Gabe?



It's up to you.



- Oh, ten thirty's good.
- Are you ready?



Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.



Alright, I'll meet you outside.



Alright, I'll see you then.



Good morning.



Hey.



Is your brother up yet?



Yeah, I think so.



You wanna have a bagel or something?



Naw, I'm good.



Okay. Don't forget the propane today.



Yeah, I know.



Pete, come on. Get up.



Pete.



Wake up. Come on. Need some help?



Here, try smelling that.



You should try
washing 'em once in a while.



Come on. You've had your sleep.



Listen, I can't drive you this morning.



So you've gotta get going.
You're gonna be late. Okay?



Okay.



You're gonna wear this stuff?



Now you're gonna need this
for your regions exam. Remember...



...the quadratic formula is:



X equals...



...negative B plus or minus...



...the radical of B squared...



...minus 4 AC...



...over 2 A.



Everybody write this down
and commit it to memory you...



...will need it.



Pete!



Out, please?



Thank you.



Oh, Pete.



Yeah?



Um...



...Mister Austin told me
to tell you that



he doesn't want to see you today.



Really?



Yeah. Apparently.



So, I'm supposed to go back to class?



Ah, no...



...actually. He didn't say that either.



So?



So, you're just supposed to sit there
for the rest of the day until detention.



And um... think about your life.



My life?



Yeah, that's what he said.



What about it?



You know he wasn't very specific
about that, actually.



Um, but perhaps. Maybe you could
just free associate a bit...



...you know? Ummm...



I do that, and ahh...
it helps me. Just...



...you know center and just breathe.



What's going on, boss?



What's happening?



Do you have any shifts
you don't need next week?



Why?



I was looking to take on a couple extra.



I thought you might have
a few you don't need.



Why?



Extra shifts, extra money.



Are you alright?



Yeah.



You already work like, six days.



Yeah, I wanna pick up some doubles.



Why?



Help me out.



Ah, yeah. You can have Friday.



Yeah? Alright.



Thanks man.



Gabe"z".



Fuckin' weirdo.



Thanks, Sport.



We're all done, Bill.



Thanks, Jim.



Why don't you go wash up.



They grow up pretty fast... huh?



How are your guys doing?



Good, I guess. Yeah.



How you doing otherwise?



Good.
You know the season's just starting.



So it's all good.



Jim, did you ever meet Sue's friend,
Elaine?



From the hair salon on thirty three?



I don't get down
to the hair salon all that much. No.



No, she's been to some
of the games with us.



No.



You know me, I wouldn't ah...



I just thought you might like
to meet her. You know?



Yeah. No, I appreciate it.



But...



It's okay. Listen, say hi
to your guys for us. Okay?



I will. I will.



Are you staying for dinner?



I told you, I can't tonight.



Alright, alright...



Stace.



Hey, Jim.



You hook up the tank?



Hmm?



Did you hook up the tank.



Naw, I didn't get around to it yet.



Why didn't you do it
before you showered?



Because Pete's supposed to help me,
and he's nowhere to be found.



Well, what's Pete got to do with it?



What Pete has to do with it is,
it's his job.



And he's supposed to help me.



We talked about this, this morning.



We all do equal amount
of work around here.



You ever lift one of those things
by yourself?



Yeah, about six hundred times.



The thing weighs like ninety pounds.



Well, why didn't you get Stacy
to help you?



Because it's not Stacy's job to help me.
It's Pete's job to help me.



You guys busy on Sunday?



I don't think so.



'Cause I was thinking we could um...



...drive out to Allaire
and rent a boat or something.



I've gotta see about work.



Yeah, I gotta see about some stuff too.



Well you know, it's okay guys,
we don't have to hang out. You know.



Really?



Well, you don't have to get so excited
about it. If I'm not cool enough.



That's not it.



Oh really? Then what is it?



What? You think you're cooler than me?



Well, I do better cutlet breading.



No.



Hey, the salt in this breading
is crushing me, man.



I'll tell you what.



When you cook, don't use it. Okay?



- Amen.
- I don't.



Good.



I leave it on the table.



Good for you, Pete.



Salt is an option.



You cook bland.



I delicately season, yes.



I can't even taste it when you cook it.



Whatever.



You fear seasoning.
It's an issue you have to deal with.



Okay.



I'll spice it up for you.



Go ahead. I'm not gonna eat it anyway.



I'm gonna get a little juice
to counteract the saltiness.



Oh ah, Pete.



I got a letter
from your school about a...



...parent teacher meeting
on Friday night.



Okay.



I'm just letting you know.



Mister Winters? Come on in.



Have a seat.



Well, as you probably know,
Mister Winters.



I'm just Pete's History teacher.



But I've spoken with his other teachers,
and with Vice Principle Austin. And...



...we sort of felt that since



I was the only teacher Pete
seems connected to...



...that I should be having this talk
with you.



Okay, yeah.



Ah, well first... ah...



Pete will have
to go to summer school again.



I know you've heard this before.



Looking back at his record,
I see that he was left back in umm...



Pete was not left back.



He was away from school for a while,
so he lost some time.



But he was not left back.



Mister Winters, we don't think
there's anything wrong with Pete.



It's just no telling when he'll try,
and when he won't. It's like he umm...



Well, we don't know what.



It must be very frustrating.



For you as well.



Come on, Robbie!



He's confusing me!



Nice.



You see him?



What's the score?



Seven to five.



Hey Mister Winters.



Hey Robbie. How are ya?



Okay, thanks.



What's up?



We need to talk.



I'll be home a little later.



We need to talk now.



We have next game.



I think we need to do it now, Pete.



Later Dude.



I'll be back, Dude.



Okay, man.



What is up?



When is this gonna end?



What?



You have to finish high school. Okay?



Then you can do what you want.



I understand that your life is your own.
Okay? But you have to finish.



Have to?



Yes, you have to.
There's nothing wrong with your brain.



There's nothing wrong
with your hearing aid.



What the fuck does my hearing aid have
to do with anything?



When does this crap...



Are we done?



Can I go?



Just finish, Pete.



Can I go?



Yeah.



Hey, Bob.



Hey, Mister Winters.



What's up?



Well, that lady down
at the Wentworth's needs a hand truck,



or some kind of dolly.



She's asking about a hand truck.



And I suggested like a dolly.



I'm pretty sure you have a hand truck.



Yeah, fine.



Hey, wouldn't you guys rather help,
than just...



...stare at me all day?



Seems kinda boring,
just sitting there staring.



Looking tough.



How about some cookies?



Or cash! There could be cash in it
for you guys.



For some reason,
cash doesn't work with them.



Alright, now we're talking.



Thank you.



Yeah, it's the...



...local gang.



A gang who refuses cash!



Yeah well, I would accept the cash.
Actually, I'd help you for nothing.



But ah... I'm really busy today
and I can't. So...



Oh no, no, no. That's fine.
This will definitely help.



But I could help you get this on.



Thank you.



I'm Molly Ripken.



Ah... Jim Winters.
I just live down the block.



Nice to meet you.



So you're umm...



You're house sitting.



A favor for an old friend. Yeah.



House sitting. Plant watering.
Various other things I imagine.



Lawn cutting...



Right.



Anyway, which house is yours
so I know where to return it.



Number forty seven. It's about
a block and a half down there.



Alright,
I'll get this right back to you.



Hey, no rush. No problem. Okay?



Thanks.



- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.



So listen, we gotta have a talk here.



Why's that?



It's a... a decision I made.



What's that?



I'm gonna be leaving soon.



Leaving?



Yeah.



What, you mean you're moving out
and getting your own place?



Ah...



Actually I'm leaving town.
I'm going to go to Tampa.



Stay with... Brian for a while.
And maybe get a place down there.



Why?



I don't know, exactly.



You're leaving town,
and you don't have a reason?



No, I have reasons for it.



Well what's your reason?



Where do you think you're going?



This is between you two.



I want you to sit down over there,
Pete. Pete!



Pete, get back in here and sit down!



Hey, take it easy!



Why didn't you talk to me?



Gabe?



Why didn't you talk to me?



What about Stacy?



That's my problem,
and I'm dealing with it.



And what are you going to do in Tampa?



Well, Brian says he can get me a job
on his uncle's boat.



I'm gonna do that and get a place.



See what happens.



You're going to work on a boat.



Yeah. I am.



Look, I've been thinking...
about this for a long time.



It's got nothing to do with you.



It's...



I think you should sit down Gabe.
And we... should talk about this.



No. There's nothing to talk about.



I think there's plenty to talk about.



I want you to sit down
and I want to discuss this.



I don't wanna sit down and discuss it.



I want you to sit down
so that we can talk about this!



No, no! Listen... to me!



There's nothing to discuss!
Okay. I'm gonna get the money together.



And them I'm leaving. It's a plan.
It's settled.



You know, every day this place
just looks a little worse to me.



I just...
I can't get anything started here.



You know.



I'll be fine.



Can I see that soda a sec?



What?



Dude, I'm not doing anything.



Good. Because I'm not dealing with
this tonight.



I'm know.



Alright, cool.



Cool.



Hey Bender!



How's it going, man?



It's Good. Good.



What's going on?



I'm awesome.



Good to hear it.



Just drive. Okay?



Dude, I'm fine.



Yeah, what's up... man?



Oh nothing, man.



Don't fuckin' go anywhere, man!



I'm right here, Dude!



Get in the fuckin' car, asshole.



I'll be right here, man!



You fucking pussy!



Fuck, dude! Fuck!



Ah, dude.



Over some stupid girl. You happy?



No. My fucking eye!



Pete?



Yeah?



- What's wrong?
- Nothing.



- What's wrong?
- Nothing.



Let me have a look.



Why?



Just because I wanna have a look.



- Dad, I'm fine.
- Come on, come here.



Dad, I'm fine.



Come here, under the light.
Just for asecond. Come on. Come here.



Okay, put your head up. Let me see.



In the light.



Okay, move your eye to the left.
To the right. Okay, hang on a second.



A piece of gravel or something. Okay.



There's one more there.



Okay.



Is that it?



Yeah. Okay, yeah. I think so.



You okay?



Alright.



Get some sleep. Alright?



Hello?



Hi.



Hi?



Do you live here?



No.



I was just trying to return... this...



Hey Pete!



What?



Someone's here to see you!



Okay.



Hi. I'm Molly Ripken.
I'm house sitting down the street.



What's your name?



Pete Winters.



Umm... I borrowed this...
from your dad. And...



...just returning it,
and wanted to thank him.



Or you too, I guess. So, thanks.



Okay, you could just leave it.



Oh. Okay.



Are your parents home, actually?



I think my dad's working. I'm not sure.



Well, what about your mom?



Maybe I can help you?



Well, I just wanted to invite
your family for dinner.



Actually... to thank you.



I don't know a lot of people here
so I'm just trying to,



you know... get to know people.



You can come too, if you want.



Well, thanks.
I'll let me dad know. Okay?



Yeah, you can let me know
what night's good for you.



Yeah. Thanks again.



Nice meeting you. Both.



Bye.



Bye.



See what I have to deal with here?
This fucking nut house.



Gabe"z".



Hey. What's up man?



- What's happening?
- Nothing.



Hello.



Hello.



How's evening shift?



Alright.



What are you up to?



What are you guys doing?



Trying to rent a movie.



Bernie told me
about this big party in Clinton?



Yeah, probably not tonight, man.
You know? Just doing our thing.



Well, fucking Barry is on me
about next month's schedule.



So, If you could just finalize
that tomorrow?



Yeah, I ahh...



I'm actually not going to be
on the schedule for next month.



Why not?



I'm like, moving.



I'm going to Florida.
Like leaving town. So...



Wow.



Yeah.



You're like just getting up and going?
Just fucking doing it?



Yep.



Are you going too?



Alright well, I should head.



Do you guys want the rest of this?



Get outta here.



Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.



What do you think of these?



I think they're a little overgrown.



Yeah, I think you're right.



Oh listen, before I forget.



We're having dinner
with Molly Ripken on Wednesday night.



Who?



You know, Molly Ripken.



You know,
she's house sitting for the Wentworths.



Oh.



She doesn't know anyone.
She's... you know... she's new.



So?



So... So, we're gonna go there
and have dinner Wednesday night.



Why do I have to go?



Because you were invited.



Well, why don't you just go.



Because we were all invited.



I already talked to Pete
and we're just gonna go. Okay?



I'm working Wednesday.



Yeah, you've got the day shift.
You can be home by six thirty.



Take a shower,
and meet me and Pete by seven.



Are you serious?



Yeah, I'm serious.



You really think...



..."what's-her-name" wants me and Pete
to come to dinner with her?



Gabe, we are gonna have dinner.
With Molly Ripken...



...Wednesday at seven.
Live it and breath it, Gabe. Okay?



Alright.



You know, it's not like
I ask you to do a lot of stuff.



- Alright?
- Alright.



Fine.



These are good.



Yeah.



We're gonna take a look at history
through its contextual perspectives.



Which is a rather opaque
but very impressive way of saying,



that if history is a story. And it is.



We're gonna ask ourselves...
why are they telling it?



Who's telling that story?



Who are they telling it to?



And how does... that story change itself,
modify itself over time?



That's all part of history.



I'm sorry. Wha... What's your name?



Pete Winters.



Pete... Pete Winters?



Yep.



Oh yeah. Okay. Here you go.
Ah... we get started at nine thirty.



Sorry.



So I'm sure you'll wanna get here then



so you don't...
you don't miss anything.



Umm... could you do me a favor?



What's that?



Could you sit a little closer?



Why?



I don't know exactly.



Well, shouldn't my seat be my choice?



Just asking.



How about this one?



Okay, let's look at Mongolia.



Fucks...



You little mother fuckers.



Hey.



Hi.



Welcome. Come on in.



Thanks.



Ah... I'm sorry. My boys are not gonna
be able to make it.



They were... They were busy.
So they couldn't come.



That's fine.



They send their apologies.



I know you've probably made food
for four.



And now there's just two. But...



It's okay.



More for us. Can I get you a drink?



Ah... ah... Water would be fine.



- Okay.
- Thanks.



Please don't tell me
you're a vegetarian.



Naw.



Thank you.



I make a lot of chicken dishes.



But I know a lot of sauces.
I like to experiment.



I made a Moroccan sauce.



It's not too spicy. But...



That's um... That's great.



Oh Jim.



Don't worry about that.



No, no. I... I...



Well, they're not coming
so there's no point in... in having it.



Should we put those away?



Okay.



Where shall I put them?



The people that you're dealing with,
they have ideas.



And you have ideas.



And you put them together
and you kind of...



you create... you create this...
this garden...



...together.
It sounds like bullshit but...



No, that's a beautiful way
to describe what you do.



You obviously love what you do.
And that's...



Then, you know,
there's the maintenance part of it.



You have to...



...which in some ways...
is even more important.



Because gardens fall apart very quickly.
You really have to take care of them.



It sounds like a great business.



You umm... Seems umm...
You're here for how long?



Three months.



So you just kind of
packed up your whole life



and you come here for three months?



I happen to be in between jobs and...



What do you do?



I'm a para-legal.



Oh.



Yes I am.



And I just...



You know what,
I just needed a change of address.



You're not running from the law
or something?



I don't know. I'm just...



That's how I make a living.
But that's not what I love to do.



And umm...



I wanted to explore the other side
of things for a while.



I'm a bit of an artist, myself.



Really?



What, like painting? Or...



No, umm... No.



I'll tell you what. I will show you
what I do after dinner.



Okay.



It's beautiful.



How long you been doing this?



A long time.



Since high school, I guess.



I wish I could make a living with it.
But...



Every now and then
I sell something.



I guess it's a very competitive world.
Right?



Oh, there are a lot of jewelers
out there.



Yeah. But it's beautiful.



I mean, the details.
It's really amazing.



Thank you.



Can I get you some more coffee?



Amm... No. Actually I have to go.



Oh, okay.



I have a really busy day tomorrow.



And I gotta get a jump start on it.
So...



Sure. Thanks for coming over.



No Thank... dinner was great. Thank you.



Tell your boys,
I'm sorry they missed it.



I will.



That's okay. I'll let myself out.



- Okay.
- Alright, thanks.



- Good night.
- Good night.



Pete.



Pete?



What the fuck did you do?



What the fuck did you do?
I didn't do shit!



Well, what is this?



Why are our beds on the lawn?



The fucking...



...missed that dinner with
that fucking woman down the block.



Did you try the back door?



Yes. I tried every fucking thing.
It's fucking locked.



I'm sleeping!



I can see that.



Comfy?



Shut up!



Wow.



Dad has lost his mind.



He's a complete maniac.



It's not here.



Dude, how could you get a paper
without a sports section.



Only got a Florida sports section.
I don't know.



Oh, dude.



Yo, why don't you go see
if he'll trade?



Why don't you go ask him?
What brought this on?



Me?



You just... I don't like him, man.



Why? He's not gonna bite you.
Just go ask him for the paper.



I didn't do the homework.



Oh man. God!



Hey. Ah... do you think
we could trade papers?



What for?



We need that one for the scores.



Oh. Is that today's?



Yeah. Yeah it is.



You mind if I finish my article?



No. Go ahead.



Alright.



Have a seat.



Oh no, I'm good.



You could'a done it. He likes you.



Damn, what took so long?



Did he make you buy it or something?



Hey Stace. It's me again.



Just wondering where you are, again.
I don't know.



I keep calling you
and you're not calling me back.



So...



Just call me back, please.
When you can.



I figured you'd at least
want to say good bye.



Even if you didn't feel
like hanging out anymore. So...



just get back to me.
Alright, good bye.



What's up man?



What's up?



What you know?



You alright?



Good. Good.



Good.



I hear you're leaving town.



Yeah, yeah.



Cool.



So listen man,
where's your sister been?



Just around, I guess.



Well, she's not really...



...'cause I been to your house.
I been to school.



I been leaving her messages.



You been giving 'em to her?



Some of 'em.



Come on man.
How many times I buy you beer?



Can you help me out here?



Sorry man. I don't know.



You want me to camp out
on your front yard and wait for her?



Hey there.



Hey Stacy.



Gabe's still at work.



I know. I just umm...



wanted to return some of your stuff,
for Gabe. I guess.



- Oh cool.
- I don't know,



I think some of it's yours.



Alright.



Nice.



Look at this.



How long have you had this?



I told you about that a million times.
You never came by to get it.



Hey... you still owe me a game,
you know.



You and Gabe still not talking?



It's better this way.



I mean, there's really not much to say.



So...



You know you're welcome here anytime.
We'd love to see ya.



Definitely. I'll be around to say hello.



That'd be great.



Well, I'd better get going.



Take care.



...end of the spring, 1238



have conquered most issue in Europe



Hungry, having just crossed
into Austria.



The Mongols decided not to press on



and basically roll up the rest
of Europe like a carpet.



But turn around and go back home.
Anybody know why?



Rebecca?



Don't feel bad. It's considered...



...one of the strangest
events in all of military history.



The Mongolian army,



greatest most efficient
army ever been seen...



...was about to take Europe.
But they didn't.



Hey, you know why?



What if I gave you the day off
if you could tell me the answer?



You will?



Why? Do you know?



The strategy guys
couldn't agree on where to go next.



Okay, that's part of it.



What's the main thing?



They found out their leader died.



Alright. Off you go.



They found out their leader died.
Genghis Khan. And with that...



Hey.



Hey, what's up?



Nothing.



What, no school?



Naw, I was released early.



You work tonight?



Ahh... naw. Just packin'.



Cool.



Hey.



Hey.



What are you doing?



Nothing.



That's the stuff, right?



Yeah. Yeah.



So, Florida. Huh?



Yeah.



You know what
I was thinking the other day?



What?



You don't know anything about Florida.



I mean, you don't. Do you?



No.



That's what I thought.



I'll tell you though.



I'll bet Brian lives
in the most boring city there.



Probably, yeah.



It'll be warm though.



Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.



So, let's dive!



Hey.



What are you doing?



I'm just going through some stuff.



Well, it's getting late.
Maybe you should finish up tomorrow.



No, I'll clean up.



Where'd you find this?



It was under the stairs over there.



This was her stuff.



You can't take this.



Why not?



Because it belongs here.



Says who?



Says me.



Hey, you'd better clean that stuff off.



There was dust all over it!



Hey.



Hey.



Nice night.



It's beautiful



So, this is where everyone hangs out?



Yeah, it's kind
of like the local community center.



You wanna get in?



Sure.



So, how's the ah...
how's the town treating ya?



I've actually made a few friends.



- Really?
- Yeah.



That's good.



Nice.



No.



- No.
- No. I've...



I've never been married.



I was engaged once.
But it just didn't work out.



Well, I'm sorry about that.



No, don't be.



'Cause it would have been
a huge mistake.



I was married.
Well I haven't been now for five years.



My wife died ah... in an accident
just ah... south of town.



Well, I'm sorry.



Yeah. Me too.



She was picking up my youngest son
from baseball practice.



On the way home,
she was at an intersection.



And there was this guy,
he was coming the other way.



And he was trying to...
Trying to beat a yellow light.



But it was raining.
And he changed his mind.



And so he tried to stop.
But it was too late.



The car went into a skid and just...



...skidded right through
the intersection.



And he slammed into my wife's car.
She...



...she died on the way to the hospital.



And ahh...
I never got to speak to her again.



You know it could have been...
It could have been worse.



You know. I mean, thank God you know,
Pete... Pete made it through it.



Was he okay? Was he...?



Yeah. He's okay, more or less.



You know it's really weird.



Sometimes when I'm concentrating
on something really hard,



or in the morning
just as I'm waking up;



I forget, just for a second.
But I forget.



You know,
it's this really strange thing,



where everything that you've built
your life on...



everything that you think you are.



Is just gone.



It's just gone.



Gabe, you got some mail.



Okay.



Do you have a forwarding address
for Brian yet?



Yeah, I took care of it. Thanks.



Do you want a hand with that?



No, I got it.



No, it's kind of difficult.
You have to...



...push it down here on that plate.



I got it. It's bent.



Yeah, I know.
That's why you have to un...



Damn it!



Sorry.



Are you alright?



Just go inside.



Don't talk to me that way.
Just remember where you are.



Sorry, what?



What did you say?



Forget it.



Oh no, "forget it." What did you say?
Why don't you just say it.



I know what you're thinking.



This town is for losers! Right?



I never thought that.



Well that's how you act.



You promised that you would try
and work things out here.



I did try to work things out here.



It doesn't really look like it.



Do you know how hard it is for me
to make all of this work?



Well, you think it's easy for me?
I don't want to do it anymore!



Who's asking you to?
Huh? Who is asking?



You've had your eye on the door
ever since your mother died!



Oh bullshit! That's a fucking lie!



And you know what?
It's not my fault that she's gone.



I never said it was your fault!



You ever thing for two seconds that
maybe I have to go



and do something for myself?
For once! For my life?



And what are you gonna do?
You're gonna go live on Brian's couch?



Yeah! Brian's couch!
Something for me for a change!



For my life!



No, no, no. This is your life!



Go inside!



Don't you ever talk to me that way!



Hey!



How are you?



Good.



It's beautiful today.



Yeah.



What are you up to?

out to dinner tonight.
