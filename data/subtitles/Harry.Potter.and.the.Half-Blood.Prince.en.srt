00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,781
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

3
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,941
<i>He's back.</i>

4
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,661
<i>The police are
continuing with the investigation...</i>

5
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,781
<i>... into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</i>

6
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,491
<i>Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.</i>

7
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,261
<i>The surrounding area remains closed.</i>

8
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,461
<i>The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...</i>

9
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,781
"Harry Potter."

10
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,861
Who's Harry Potter?

11
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,261
Oh, no one.

12
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,101
Bit of a tosser, really.

13
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,101
Funny, that paper of yours.

14
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,781
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

15
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,621
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

16
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:47,461
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

17
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,301
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

18
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,261
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

19
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,621
I like riding around on trains.

20
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,661
Takes my mind off things.

21
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,941
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

22
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,301
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

23
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,901
But now is not the time to tell it.

24
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,581
Take my arm.

25
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,301
Do as I say.

26
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:12,461
I just Apparated, didn't I?

27
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,661
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

28
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,341
Most people vomit the first time.

29
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,181
I can't imagine why.

30
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:31,181
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

31
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:35,461
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

32
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,261
Am I right?

33
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:40,661
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

34
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,781
Wands out, Harry.

35
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:59,141
Horace?

36
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,141
Horace?

37
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,501
Merlin's beard!

38
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,821
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

39
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,531
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

40
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:15,661
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

41
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,381
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,781
- Oh.
Oh, yes, introductions.

43
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,781
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

44
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,341
...Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,941
Horace...

46
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:31,781
...well, you know who this is.

47
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:34,541
Harry Potter.

48
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:38,941
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

49
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,461
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

50
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,981
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

51
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,741
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

52
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:49,181
Do you know what that's like?

53
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:52,941
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

54
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,341
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

55
00:07:55,511 --> 00:08:00,181
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

56
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,181
That was fun.

57
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:39,021
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

58
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,871
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

59
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:48,301
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

60
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,341
You're very like your father.

61
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,181
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

62
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:05,891
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

63
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:09,261
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

64
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,891
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

65
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:14,021
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

66
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:18,221
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

67
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,101
Right at the front.

68
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:31,101
All mine. Each and every one.

69
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,261
Ex-students, I mean.

70
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,621
<i>You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.</i>

71
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:42,851
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

72
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,251
...on the news of the day.

73
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,941
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

74
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,461
Free tickets whenever I want them.

75
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,501
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

76
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:56,621
Ah, yes.

77
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,861
Regulus Black.

78
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,811
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

79
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:05,421
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

80
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,701
It's a shame. Talented boy.

81
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:12,941
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

82
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,931
Horace?

83
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,101
Do you mind if I take this?

84
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:24,981
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

85
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,141
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

86
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,501
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

87
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,501
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

88
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:36,541
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

89
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,781
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

90
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,011
Bye.

91
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,981
All right. I'll do it.

92
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:58,541
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

93
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,741
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

94
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,021
They are indeed.

95
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:11,101
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

96
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,141
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

97
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,581
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

98
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,021
You would be his crowning jewel.

99
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:27,501
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

100
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:31,181
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

101
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,181
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

102
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:39,661
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

103
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:43,341
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

104
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,381
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

105
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,111
Both are waiting for you.

106
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,701
Hedwig.

107
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,381
Mum?

108
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,021
Ginny, what is it?

109
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,581
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

110
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,861
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

111
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:38,061
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

112
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,581
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

113
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,701
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

114
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:47,741
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

115
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,821
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

116
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,371
Is that an owl?
You haven't seen him, have you?

117
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:55,221
He's wandering about the house.

118
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,061
Really?
Really.

119
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,821
Harry!

120
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,421
Harry!

121
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,091
Hello.

122
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:11,421
What a lovely surprise.

123
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:15,661
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

124
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,541
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

125
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,861
But then, what would we do
without him?

126
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,631
Got a bit of toothpaste.

127
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:32,901
So when did you get here?

128
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,701
A few days ago.

129
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,821
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

130
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,741
Mum sort of lost it last week.

131
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,741
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

132
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,221
That it's too dangerous.

133
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,101
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

134
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,461
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

135
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,331
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

136
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:58,931
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

137
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,981
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

138
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,701
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

139
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,061
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

140
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,941
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

141
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,621
What is he?

142
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,861
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

143
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:39,781
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

144
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,341
The Dark Lord trusts him.

145
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:44,941
The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

146
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,181
Run along, Wormtail.

147
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,461
I know I ought not to be here.

148
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,181
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

149
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,911
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

150
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:31,141
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

151
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:38,651
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

152
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:39,941
You?

153
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:43,181
The Dark Lord told you?

154
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:46,181
Your sister doubts me.

155
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,901
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

156
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:53,661
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

157
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:58,781
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

158
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,781
I don't doubt you, Severus.

159
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,981
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

160
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:10,021
He's just a boy.

161
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,741
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

162
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:18,821
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

163
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,301
Severus.
- Swear to it.

164
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,531
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

165
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:36,181
It's just empty words.

166
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,421
He'll give it his best effort.

167
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:41,861
But when it matters most...

168
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:47,461
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

169
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,341
Coward.

170
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,701
Take out your wand.

171
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:12,461
Will you...

172
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,581
...Severus Snape...

173
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,541
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

174
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:22,341
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

175
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,261
I will.

176
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:30,101
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

177
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,861
...protect him from harm?

178
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,491
I will.

179
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,891
And if Draco should fail...

180
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:45,421
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

181
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:50,381
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

182
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:56,861
I will.

183
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,581
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

184
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,731
Nosebleed Nougats!

185
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:25,861
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

186
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,741
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

187
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:32,861
<i>I will have order!</i>

188
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,221
<i>I really hate children. I will have order!</i>

189
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:41,981
<i>I really hate children. I will have order!</i>

190
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,901
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

191
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,101
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

192
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,941
Hello, ladies.
Hello, ladies.

193
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:53,261
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

194
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,621
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

195
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,901
Meaning?

196
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,101
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

197
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,221
It's none of your business.

198
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:08,731
How much for this?

199
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,221
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

200
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,421
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

201
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:13,731
I'm your brother.

202
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,061
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

203
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,501
Come on, let's go.

204
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,221
Hi, Ron.

205
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,181
Hi.

206
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:41,741
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

207
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,371
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

208
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,701
I reckon he's right.

209
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,941
Oh, no.

210
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,621
Everyone got their wands
from OIlivander's.

211
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:05,901
Harry?

212
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,661
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

213
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:11,461
...who don't want to be followed?

214
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,661
<i>Quibbler.</i>

215
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,861
<i>Quibbler.</i>

216
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:03,181
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

217
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,621
<i>- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.</i>

218
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,221
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

219
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:12,421
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

220
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,421
<i>Quibbler.</i>

221
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:27,101
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

222
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:28,901
And who were all those people?

223
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:32,061
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

224
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,061
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

225
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:36,611
It's happened. He's one of them.

226
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,221
One of what?

227
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:42,261
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

228
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,301
You're barking.

229
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:46,501
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

230
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:50,541
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

231
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,501
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

232
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,371
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

233
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,061
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

234
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:01,421
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

235
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:04,541
I need some air.

236
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:24,211
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

237
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,901
What was that? Blaise?
Don't know.

238
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:50,061
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

239
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:53,461
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

240
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:06,371
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

241
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,461
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

242
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,661
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

243
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:12,101
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,981
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

245
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,461
Amused, Blaise?

246
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:24,171
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

247
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:49,021
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

248
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:52,331
Where's Harry?

249
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:55,341
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

250
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:13,741
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

251
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,421
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

252
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,581
Oh, yeah...

253
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,141
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

254
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:39,461
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

255
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,181
<i>Finite.</i>

256
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,291
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

257
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:35,181
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

258
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:44,191
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

259
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:47,381
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

260
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,501
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

261
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:51,621
That's nice.

262
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:54,861
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

263
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,741
Right. Names?

264
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,261
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

265
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:02,461
No exceptions, Potter.

266
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:04,661
Who are those people?

267
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,021
Aurors. For security.

268
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:08,581
What's this cane here, then?

269
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,021
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

270
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:15,021
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

271
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,101
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

272
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:24,291
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

273
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,261
Nice face, Potter.

274
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,781
Would you like me to fix it for you?

275
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,571
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

276
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,221
...but it's up to you.

277
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,821
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

278
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:53,531
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

279
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:58,301
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

280
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,581
<i>- Episkey.
- Ah!</i>

281
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:11,501
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

282
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,901
Brilliant.

283
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,941
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

284
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,261
Will you stop eating?

285
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,581
Your best friend is missing!

286
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,861
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

287
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,981
He's covered in blood again.

288
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:43,211
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

289
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,461
Where have you been?

290
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,981
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

291
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:49,701
What've I missed?

292
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:53,851
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

293
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,421
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

294
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,581
Very best of evenings to you all.

295
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,731
Thanks.

296
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:14,341
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

297
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:16,661
...Horace Slughorn.

298
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,181
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

299
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:26,461
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

300
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,421
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

301
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:31,301
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

302
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:33,101
Snape?

303
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,461
Now, as you know...

304
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:44,141
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

305
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:46,221
And you have the right to know why.

306
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,421
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

307
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,941
...sat in this very hall...

308
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:57,741
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

309
00:29:58,311 --> 00:30:02,501
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

310
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,141
His name?

311
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:06,821
Tom Riddle.

312
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,381
Today, of course...

313
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:17,101
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

314
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:23,221
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

315
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:25,661
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

316
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,781
Every day, every hour...

317
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,821
...this very minute, perhaps...

318
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:36,141
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

319
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:43,021
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

320
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,981
Just something to think about.

321
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:50,701
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

322
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,021
That was cheerful.

323
00:30:59,111 --> 00:31:03,661
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

324
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:09,221
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

325
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,261
Potter.

326
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,421
Oh, this can't be good.

327
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:20,901
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

328
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,861
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

329
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,651
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

330
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:30,391
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

331
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:34,621
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

332
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,541
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

333
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:42,101
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

334
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:43,981
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

335
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:46,061
Brilliant. Um...

336
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:48,581
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

337
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:53,461
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

338
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,411
I don't wanna take Potions.

339
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:59,181
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

340
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,261
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

341
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:04,621
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

342
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,381
Ah.

343
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,301
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

344
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:13,051
Ron Weasley, sir.

345
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,941
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

346
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,101
- I'm gonna...
Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

347
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,221
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

348
00:32:21,391 --> 00:32:23,821
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

349
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:25,621
Get what you want from the cupboard.

350
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,981
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

351
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:32,931
Any ideas what these might be?

352
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:36,851
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

353
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,261
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

354
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,021
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

355
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,101
It's terribly tricky to make.

356
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,221
And this is Amortentia...

357
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,691
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

358
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:01,261
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

359
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,421
For example, I smell...

360
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:09,021
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

361
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:12,381
...spearmint toothpaste.

362
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:17,061
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

363
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:22,021
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

364
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:28,581
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

365
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,581
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

366
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:38,581
Oh, yes.

367
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,211
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

368
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:46,581
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

369
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,141
But it is more commonly referred to as...

370
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:54,381
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

371
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,741
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

372
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:03,301
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

373
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:07,651
At least until the effects wear off.

374
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:12,141
So this is what I offer each of you today.

375
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:16,941
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

376
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:21,501
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

377
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:24,781
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

378
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:28,461
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

379
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,821
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

380
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,541
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

381
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:37,101
Let the brewing commence.

382
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:13,221
How did you do that?

383
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:15,821
You crush it. Don't cut it.

384
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,371
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

385
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,301
No, really.

386
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:59,301
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

387
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,821
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

388
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:08,861
So here we are, then, as promised.

389
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:12,101
One vial of Felix Felicis.

390
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,221
Congratulations.

391
00:36:14,711 --> 00:36:17,341
Use it well.

392
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:46,391
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

393
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,301
How are you?

394
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,941
I'm fine, sir.

395
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:52,301
Enjoying your classes?

396
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,421
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

397
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,301
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

398
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:01,051
Do you?

399
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:02,781
Definitely.

400
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,421
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

401
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:10,501
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

402
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:13,181
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

403
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:14,541
I can't help wondering...

404
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:19,501
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

405
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,541
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

406
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,381
But enough chitchat.

407
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:29,021
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

408
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:32,301
The answer lies here.

409
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:35,341
What you are looking at are memories.

410
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:39,181
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

411
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:41,701
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

412
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:48,301
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

413
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:50,581
...of the day I first met him.

414
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:54,541
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

415
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:34,701
<i>I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</i>

416
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:38,341
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

417
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:42,101
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

418
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:46,501
Tom, you have a visitor.

419
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:48,621
How do you do, Tom?

420
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:57,021
Don't.

421
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,501
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

422
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:09,621
I am a professor.

423
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:12,061
I don't believe you.

424
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:14,141
She wants me looked at.

425
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,821
They think I'm different.

426
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,421
Well, perhaps they're right.

427
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:19,981
I'm not mad.

428
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,341
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

429
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:25,421
Hogwarts is a school.

430
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:27,261
A school of magic.

431
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,221
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

432
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,871
Things other children can't.

433
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,021
I can make things move
without touching them.

434
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:46,341
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

435
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:50,501
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

436
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:52,981
I can make them hurt...

437
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,061
...if I want.

438
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:57,381
Who are you?

439
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:59,661
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

440
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,181
I'm different.

441
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:04,541
Prove it.

442
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:15,501
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

443
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:28,451
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

444
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:34,061
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

445
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,341
You understand me?

446
00:40:39,151 --> 00:40:41,581
I can speak to snakes too.

447
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,501
They find me.

448
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:47,301
Whisper things.

449
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,541
Is that normal for someone like me?

450
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,901
Did you know, sir? Then?

451
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:19,461
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

452
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:22,061
If I had, I...

453
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,981
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

454
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,341
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

455
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:31,261
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

456
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:37,381
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

457
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,501
No, I did not.

458
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:43,341
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

459
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:46,101
And he will not give it up easily.

460
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:49,341
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

461
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:50,701
I did.

462
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,301
Do you want me to let him?

463
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:55,941
Yes.

464
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:18,301
All right. Um...

465
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,421
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

466
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:23,621
...just to assess your strengths.

467
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,221
Quiet! Please!

468
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:27,501
Shut it!

469
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,821
Thanks. All right. Um...

470
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:36,021
Just because you
made the team last year...

471
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:39,021
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

472
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:42,651
Good.

473
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:53,141
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

474
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:54,811
Hard feelings?

475
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:58,381
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

476
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:01,111
Really? Strapping guy like you?

477
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,731
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

478
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,211
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

479
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,261
Oh, I like my chances.

480
00:44:09,431 --> 00:44:13,051
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

481
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:17,221
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

482
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:30,661
Come on, Weasley!

483
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:32,461
Come on, Ron!
Go on, Weasley!

484
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:36,701
Go on, Weasley!
Yeah, Ron!

485
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:38,061
Go on, Cormac!

486
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:55,901
Come on, Ron!

487
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,421
Come on, Ron.

488
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,941
Come on, Ron.

489
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,221
<i>Confundus.</i>

490
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,901
Isn't he brilliant?

491
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:49,901
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

492
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:52,901
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

493
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:56,221
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

494
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,181
He's vile.

495
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:06,101
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

496
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:08,261
No, I haven't.

497
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:11,421
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

498
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,941
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

499
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:18,101
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

500
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:20,411
What?

501
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,821
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

502
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:25,421
No.

503
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,091
Why not?

504
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:30,181
The binding is fragile.

505
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:32,861
The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

506
00:46:36,951 --> 00:46:38,461
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

507
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:42,221
That's what it says right here: " This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

508
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:02,061
<i>For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...</i>

509
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:04,421
<i>... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?</i>

510
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:07,861
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

511
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,011
Well, it's true.

512
00:47:09,191 --> 00:47:12,781
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

513
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:14,861
It's just like being with Hermione.

514
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,491
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

515
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:21,101
- The library.
- The library. And?

516
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,541
And nothing.

517
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:26,621
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

518
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,781
- There we go. That settles it, then.
Filius!

519
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:31,181
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

520
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:35,821
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

521
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,491
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

522
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:43,981
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

523
00:47:44,151 --> 00:47:47,621
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

524
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:50,141
No, not there. Over here.

525
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,221
No, sit beside me.

526
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:55,131
Okay.

527
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:57,861
Something to drink?

528
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:00,461
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

529
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,621
Oh, bloody hell.

530
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:18,221
Slick git.

531
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,111
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

532
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,021
And snogging.

533
00:48:25,671 --> 00:48:28,501
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

534
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,181
You can't be serious.

535
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:32,621
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

536
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,541
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

537
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,141
Hey, my boy!
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

538
00:48:40,311 --> 00:48:42,221
And you, and you.

539
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,101
So, what brings you here?

540
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:48,781
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

541
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:52,261
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

542
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,621
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

543
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:59,061
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

544
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,341
...for the select student or two.

545
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:05,211
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

546
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,701
You would be welcome too, Granger.

547
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:14,021
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

548
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:16,741
Good to see you, Wallenby.

549
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:23,101
What are you playing at?

550
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,061
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

551
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,101
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

552
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:32,861
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

553
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:40,261
Got a little bit...

554
00:49:50,711 --> 00:49:52,501
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

555
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:54,061
Harry.
What?

556
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:57,581
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

557
00:49:58,351 --> 00:50:00,021
As if.

558
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:09,381
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

559
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,621
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

560
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:49,261
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

561
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:04,651
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

562
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,211
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

563
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,301
It's like I said.

564
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:14,221
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

565
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:18,021
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

566
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:22,181
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

567
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:25,071
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

568
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:34,861
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

569
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:40,141
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

570
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,181
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

571
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,461
What do you think?

572
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:55,901
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

573
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,221
She was cursed, wasn't she?

574
00:51:58,391 --> 00:52:00,951
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

575
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:04,861
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

576
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:06,861
Yes, she was cursed.

577
00:52:07,631 --> 00:52:09,221
It was Malfoy.

578
00:52:11,071 --> 00:52:14,691
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

579
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:16,301
Indeed.

580
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:20,381
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

581
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,021
You just...

582
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,541
...know.

583
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:30,301
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

584
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:34,251
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

585
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,301
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

586
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:48,141
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

587
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:01,021
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

588
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:04,581
Well, what does she see in him?

589
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,861
Dean? He's brilliant.

590
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:09,741
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

591
00:53:09,911 --> 00:53:13,531
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

592
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:18,061
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

593
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:20,141
I suppose.

594
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:24,381
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

595
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:27,411
She's smart, funny.

596
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:30,341
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

597
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:35,181
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

598
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:37,741
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

599
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:42,221
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

600
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:47,141
Hermione's got nice skin.

601
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:50,461
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

602
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:53,381
I've never really thought about it.

603
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:56,501
But, I suppose, yeah.

604
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:58,621
Very nice.

605
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:06,101
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

606
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,331
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

607
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,891
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

608
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:24,181
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

609
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:27,181
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

610
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,261
What about your uncle, Belby?

611
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,741
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

612
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:35,581
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

613
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:39,661
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

614
00:54:39,831 --> 00:54:42,981
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

615
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:48,061
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

616
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,541
My parents are dentists.

617
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:56,131
They tend to people's teeth.

618
00:54:56,311 --> 00:55:00,861
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

619
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,251
No.

620
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:08,461
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

621
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:09,821
He needed 10 stitches.

622
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:19,301
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

623
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:26,141
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

624
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,901
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

625
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,781
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

626
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:45,421
What?

627
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:47,141
Nothing.

628
00:55:53,231 --> 00:55:56,701
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

629
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,061
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:05,691
I was just admiring your hourglass.

631
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,421
Oh, yes.

632
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:10,901
A most intriguing object.

633
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:15,621
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

634
00:56:15,911 --> 00:56:19,021
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

635
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:21,341
- lf it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

636
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,701
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

637
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:27,021
As to some of your classmates...

638
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:30,461
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

639
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:32,061
The shelf, sir?

640
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:36,101
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

641
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:39,971
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

642
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,341
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

643
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:49,181
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

644
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:53,581
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

645
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:55,261
What was he like?

646
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,101
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

647
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,501
He killed my parents.

648
00:57:06,151 --> 00:57:07,371
Of course.

649
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:10,621
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

650
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:15,341
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

651
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,381
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

652
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:22,621
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

653
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,461
Not unlike others I've known.

654
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,021
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

655
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:30,301
If the monster existed...

656
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:32,981
...it was buried deep within.

657
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,021
Good luck, eh, Ron.

658
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:54,741
Nice hat!
Ron, you're a loser.

659
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:57,861
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

660
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,261
Looking good, Ron.
Loser!

661
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:03,821
What's he wearing?

662
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:13,861
So how was it, then?

663
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,261
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

664
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:18,981
Pretty boring, actually.

665
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:21,981
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

666
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,901
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

667
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,541
And we're meant to bring someone.

668
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:33,251
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

669
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:36,141
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
Really?

670
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:40,781
Good luck today, Ron.

671
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,821
I know you'll be brilliant.

672
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:50,341
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

673
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:51,941
Have it your way.

674
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,491
- Juice?
- Sure.

675
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:56,301
Hello, everyone.

676
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:59,501
You look dreadful, Ron.

677
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,941
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

678
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:05,621
Is it a tonic?

679
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:10,501
Liquid luck.

680
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,421
Don't drink it, Ron.

681
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:23,941
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:59:26,071 --> 00:59:28,581
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

683
00:59:51,431 --> 00:59:53,261
Yes!

684
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:56,381
Go on, Ron! Do it!

685
01:00:28,951 --> 01:00:31,141
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

686
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:32,901
Yes!

687
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:36,381
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

688
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,541
Whoo!

689
01:00:41,711 --> 01:00:44,781
Yes. Whoo!

690
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:51,101
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

691
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:56,821
You really shouldn't have done it.

692
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:01,781
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

693
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:07,181
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

694
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:11,501
You didn't put it in.

695
01:01:13,151 --> 01:01:14,901
Ron only thought you did.

696
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:03,901
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

697
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:09,421
Well, they're really good.

698
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:16,621
How does it feel, Harry?

699
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:22,421
When you see Dean with Ginny?

700
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:28,701
I know.

701
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:31,821
I see the way you look at her.

702
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:34,061
You're my best friend.

703
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:44,541
Oops.

704
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:48,061
I think this room's taken.

705
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:51,101
What's with the birds?

706
01:02:54,351 --> 01:02:55,981
<i>Oppugno.</i>

707
01:03:22,871 --> 01:03:24,501
It feels like this.

708
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:05,501
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

709
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:10,531
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

710
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:12,061
It's chemical.

711
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:16,381
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

712
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:19,261
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

713
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,731
I really couldn't care less.

714
01:04:21,911 --> 01:04:25,581
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

715
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:27,181
Yes.

716
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:31,581
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

717
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:32,891
Have you?

718
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:34,981
Yes. Why?

719
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:38,621
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

720
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,941
...we should go together, as friends.

721
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,661
Why didn't I think of that?

722
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:44,301
Who are you going with?

723
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:46,181
Um, it's a surprise.

724
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:50,381
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

725
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,781
See that girl over there?

726
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:58,861
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

727
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:00,461
Really?

728
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:04,701
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

729
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:06,501
But I am the Chosen One.

730
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:09,421
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

731
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:12,741
I'll ask someone I like.

732
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:14,981
Someone cool.

733
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:27,261
I've never been to this part of the castle.

734
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:30,541
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

735
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:33,091
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

736
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:05,901
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

737
01:06:17,911 --> 01:06:20,541
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

738
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:24,591
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

739
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:39,981
Drink?

740
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,141
Neville.

741
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,701
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

742
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:46,861
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

743
01:06:47,031 --> 01:06:49,701
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

744
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,541
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

745
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:07,781
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

746
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:10,861
Cormac? That's who you invited?

747
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,411
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

748
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,141
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

749
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:19,181
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

750
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:21,421
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

751
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:24,151
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

752
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:26,061
On second thoughts...

753
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:28,141
Might keep Cormac at bay.

754
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:31,261
Oh, God, here he comes.

755
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:36,461
I think she just went to powder her nose.

756
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:38,621
Slippery little minx, your friend.

757
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:41,381
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

758
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,221
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

759
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:48,901
Dragon balls.

760
01:07:59,671 --> 01:08:02,661
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

761
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:06,531
Not so quick, Potter.

762
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:11,021
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

763
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:14,941
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

764
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:17,261
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

765
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:20,021
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

766
01:08:20,191 --> 01:08:23,701
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

767
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,341
You see...

768
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:30,821
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

769
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:32,461
Traveling where?

770
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,061
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

771
01:08:43,151 --> 01:08:44,781
Professor Slughorn, sir.

772
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:49,101
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

773
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,221
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

774
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:54,541
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

775
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:58,741
I'll escort him out.

776
01:09:01,431 --> 01:09:04,941
Certainly, professor.

777
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:11,541
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

778
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:18,261
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

779
01:09:18,431 --> 01:09:20,421
I swore to protect you.

780
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:23,781
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

781
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,021
I don't need protection.

782
01:09:26,191 --> 01:09:30,181
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

783
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:34,461
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

784
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:38,781
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

785
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,341
No!

786
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,941
I was chosen. This is my moment.

787
01:09:55,871 --> 01:09:57,381
"Unbreakable Vow."

788
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,101
You're sure that's what Snape said?

789
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:01,461
Positive. Why?

790
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,981
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

791
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:08,341
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

792
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:10,501
You don't understand.

793
01:10:11,111 --> 01:10:12,091
Oh, bloody hell.

794
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,661
I miss you.

795
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:43,781
Lovely.

796
01:10:43,951 --> 01:10:47,101
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

797
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:49,381
I'll take your word for it.

798
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,821
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

799
01:11:04,351 --> 01:11:05,981
You die.

800
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,181
Wait, the pudding's still here.

801
01:11:13,391 --> 01:11:16,581
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

802
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:17,781
I know it sounds mad.

803
01:11:17,951 --> 01:11:21,301
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

804
01:11:21,471 --> 01:11:23,851
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

805
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:26,901
- That's not what it sounded like.
Perhaps Harry's right.

806
01:11:27,431 --> 01:11:28,981
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

807
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,501
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

808
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:36,581
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

809
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:37,861
You're blinded by hatred.

810
01:11:38,031 --> 01:11:39,981
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

811
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,541
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

812
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:46,581
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

813
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:49,581
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

814
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:14,541
Open up, you.

815
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:17,701
Don't you trust me?

816
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:24,741
It's good.

817
01:12:25,631 --> 01:12:28,341
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

818
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:37,501
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

819
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:50,421
You'll have to forgive Remus.

820
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:53,381
It takes its toll, his condition.

821
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,221
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

822
01:12:56,391 --> 01:12:58,821
We're being followed, all of us.

823
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:01,371
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

824
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:04,181
It's not been easy.

825
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:07,461
Did you get my owl?

826
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:09,621
Yes, I did.

827
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:13,981
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

828
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:16,501
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

829
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:19,571
As for Draco Malfoy...

830
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:21,301
...I know a bit more.

831
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:24,821
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

832
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,221
I think, from what you described...

833
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:28,981
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

834
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:32,501
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

835
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,101
...is a vanishing cabinet.

836
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:36,171
A vanishing cabinet?

837
01:13:36,351 --> 01:13:40,181
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

838
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,181
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

839
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:47,901
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

840
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,181
They can transport you anywhere.

841
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:53,581
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

842
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:56,541
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

843
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:57,771
Nothing.

844
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:00,221
It's still there.

845
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:12,501
It was delicious, Molly, really.

846
01:14:12,671 --> 01:14:13,941
Are you sure you won't stay?

847
01:14:14,111 --> 01:14:18,301
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

848
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:19,451
Remus?

849
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,501
Sweetheart.

850
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:39,141
Has Ron gone to bed?

851
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:42,021
Um... Not yet. No.

852
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,021
Shoelace.

853
01:14:57,111 --> 01:14:58,901
Merry Christmas, Harry.

854
01:15:00,271 --> 01:15:01,741
Merry Christmas.

855
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,501
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

856
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:31,301
Ginny!

857
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:38,821
<i>I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</i>

858
01:15:38,991 --> 01:15:41,141
You coming to get me?

859
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:45,381
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

860
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:15,221
Harry?

861
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:33,621
<i>Stupefy!</i>

862
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:57,221
Harry!

863
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:11,331
Ginny!

864
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,141
Molly.

865
01:18:03,191 --> 01:18:04,821
It's easy for them to get to you.

866
01:18:04,991 --> 01:18:08,941
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

867
01:18:09,111 --> 01:18:11,541
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

868
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:13,611
Sorry.

869
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:18,421
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

870
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,661
That's my Won-Won.

871
01:18:22,591 --> 01:18:24,891
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

872
01:18:41,831 --> 01:18:44,021
<i>I'd like to know
where you get your information.</i>

873
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:47,101
<i>More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</i>

874
01:18:52,511 --> 01:18:53,981
Sir...

875
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:57,141
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

876
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,981
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

877
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:04,221
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

878
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,981
But how did you know?

879
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:10,261
Intuition.

880
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:15,901
Gracious. Is it that time already?

881
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:19,581
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

882
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:27,221
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

883
01:19:29,071 --> 01:19:31,061
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,061
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

885
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:40,741
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

886
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:44,021
They might misunderstand.

887
01:19:44,191 --> 01:19:45,701
Go on.

888
01:19:46,471 --> 01:19:48,661
I was in the library the other night...

889
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:51,301
...in the Restricted Section...

890
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:55,421
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

891
01:19:56,311 --> 01:19:59,661
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

892
01:19:59,831 --> 01:20:02,501
It's called, as I understand it...

893
01:20:05,311 --> 01:20:06,421
I beg your pardon?

894
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:10,021
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

895
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:14,781
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

896
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:18,741
Confused?

897
01:20:19,391 --> 01:20:20,821
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

898
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:24,341
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

899
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:28,021
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

900
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:30,021
It is also a lie.

901
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:32,621
This memory has been tampered with...

902
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:36,981
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

903
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:39,501
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

904
01:20:39,671 --> 01:20:42,421
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

905
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:44,021
Why, indeed?

906
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:48,021
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

907
01:20:48,191 --> 01:20:51,661
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

908
01:20:51,831 --> 01:20:53,301
...any way you can.

909
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:55,341
I don't know him that well, sir.

910
01:20:59,631 --> 01:21:02,421
This memory is everything.

911
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:04,821
Without it, we are blind.

912
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:08,781
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

913
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:12,501
You have no choice.

914
01:21:13,671 --> 01:21:15,581
You must not fail.

915
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:25,581
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

916
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,141
...with the chapter on antidotes.

917
01:21:27,311 --> 01:21:30,901
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

918
01:21:31,071 --> 01:21:33,451
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

919
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:42,331
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

920
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,341
To what do I owe this pleasure?

921
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:47,461
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

922
01:21:47,631 --> 01:21:49,781
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

923
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:52,821
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

924
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:56,501
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

925
01:21:57,791 --> 01:22:00,351
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

926
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:03,701
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

927
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:08,021
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

928
01:22:09,951 --> 01:22:11,221
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

929
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:14,101
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

930
01:22:14,271 --> 01:22:16,101
Yes. Um...

931
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:18,651
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

932
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:20,541
What I mean to say is...

933
01:22:21,351 --> 01:22:23,061
...well, he's not like you.

934
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:25,461
He might misunderstand.

935
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:30,381
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

936
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:34,421
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

937
01:22:35,031 --> 01:22:36,621
I suggest you do the same.

938
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:39,861
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

939
01:22:46,551 --> 01:22:49,461
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

940
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:52,941
Didn't he?

941
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:01,251
Yes?

942
01:23:01,631 --> 01:23:03,661
Oh, it's you, Potter.

943
01:23:03,831 --> 01:23:06,101
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

944
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:22,011
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

945
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:24,341
Divine.

946
01:23:24,991 --> 01:23:27,181
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

947
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:31,701
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

948
01:23:31,871 --> 01:23:35,221
Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

949
01:23:35,391 --> 01:23:37,301
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

950
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,701
She could never annoy me.

951
01:23:41,431 --> 01:23:42,901
I think I love her.

952
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:48,541
Well, brilliant.

953
01:23:52,231 --> 01:23:53,781
Do you think she knows I exist?

954
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:56,331
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

955
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:59,341
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

956
01:24:00,231 --> 01:24:01,421
Who are you talking about?

957
01:24:02,151 --> 01:24:05,621
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

958
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,221
Okay, very funny.

959
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:13,741
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

960
01:24:13,911 --> 01:24:16,661
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

961
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:20,421
No. Can you introduce me?

962
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:45,781
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

963
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:59,651
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

964
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:01,821
Where's Romilda?

965
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,861
What's the matter with Wenby?

966
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:06,101
Very powerful love potion.

967
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:08,541
Very well. Better bring him in.

968
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:11,861
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

969
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:14,821
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

970
01:25:14,991 --> 01:25:17,941
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

971
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:19,701
Perhaps you're right.

972
01:25:24,031 --> 01:25:29,221
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

973
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:33,581
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

974
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:36,541
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

975
01:25:36,711 --> 01:25:39,171
All the questions about Voldemort.

976
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:41,101
Don't use that name.

977
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:50,501
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

978
01:25:50,671 --> 01:25:53,661
- What's this?
Tonic for the nerves.

979
01:26:07,591 --> 01:26:09,781
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

980
01:26:09,951 --> 01:26:11,981
A bloody strong one at that.

981
01:26:12,551 --> 01:26:16,021
- I feel really bad.
You need a pick-me-up.

982
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:19,701
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

983
01:26:19,871 --> 01:26:24,021
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

984
01:26:26,231 --> 01:26:27,861
Here we are, Potter.

985
01:26:28,031 --> 01:26:29,461
To life!

986
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:35,051
Ron.

987
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:40,741
Ron. Professor, do something.

988
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,341
I don't understand.

989
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:00,781
Come on, Ron, breathe.

990
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,821
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

991
01:27:35,391 --> 01:27:38,621
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

992
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,061
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

993
01:27:41,231 --> 01:27:44,501
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

994
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:47,301
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

995
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:51,301
The question is,
why were they necessary?

996
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:53,141
Why, indeed?

997
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:55,221
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

998
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:58,261
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

999
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:02,211
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

1000
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:04,741
...when not polluted with poison.

1001
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:07,901
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1002
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:09,381
To whom, I might ask?

1003
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:13,221
To you, Headmaster.

1004
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:16,501
Where is he?

1005
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:20,621
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

1006
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:25,141
What's she doing here?

1007
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:27,461
I might ask you the same question.

1008
01:28:27,631 --> 01:28:29,781
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1009
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:32,581
I happen to be his friend.

1010
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:36,781
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1011
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:40,301
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1012
01:28:40,471 --> 01:28:44,011
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1013
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:46,901
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1014
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:53,341
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1015
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:56,661
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1016
01:28:57,311 --> 01:28:59,061
I'm here.

1017
01:29:04,671 --> 01:29:07,741
Uh... Hermione...

1018
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:13,541
Hermione.

1019
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:16,421
Hermione.

1020
01:29:23,711 --> 01:29:27,461
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1021
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:30,021
Well, come away, everybody.

1022
01:29:30,191 --> 01:29:32,701
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1023
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:39,221
About time, don't you think?

1024
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,301
Thank you.

1025
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:47,861
Oh, shut up.

1026
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:58,371
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1027
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:05,231
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1028
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:08,741
Um, well...

1029
01:32:08,911 --> 01:32:11,781
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1030
01:32:12,631 --> 01:32:14,931
And you talked.

1031
01:32:16,471 --> 01:32:20,381
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1032
01:32:20,551 --> 01:32:23,701
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1033
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,101
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1034
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:35,701
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1035
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:42,101
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1036
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:45,141
Anything at all?

1037
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:47,061
There is something.

1038
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:54,701
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1039
01:32:56,151 --> 01:32:59,221
Right. Boggled.

1040
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:07,381
Harry.

1041
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:09,901
That's Katie.

1042
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,341
Katie Bell.

1043
01:33:20,711 --> 01:33:22,981
Katie. How are you?

1044
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:27,941
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1045
01:33:29,511 --> 01:33:32,901
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1046
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:36,581
But I just can't.

1047
01:33:49,311 --> 01:33:50,581
Katie?

1048
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:35,221
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1049
01:35:04,351 --> 01:35:06,261
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1050
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:54,101
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1051
01:35:55,711 --> 01:35:58,421
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1052
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:03,381
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1053
01:36:23,631 --> 01:36:27,021
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1054
01:36:31,711 --> 01:36:33,261
Take my hand.

1055
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:50,421
The Room of Requirement.

1056
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:59,141
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1057
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:02,851
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1058
01:37:10,871 --> 01:37:12,261
- What was that?
- What was that?

1059
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,581
See?

1060
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:41,061
You never know what you'll find up here.

1061
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:03,181
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1062
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:08,501
Close your eyes.

1063
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:36,861
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1064
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:53,181
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1065
01:38:53,351 --> 01:38:54,461
What?

1066
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:56,621
You know, hide the book?

1067
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:58,581
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:39:01,391 --> 01:39:03,851
Ah. Dear, yes.

1069
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:06,701
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1070
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:09,941
Luck.

1071
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:14,141
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1072
01:39:31,551 --> 01:39:34,621
Well, how do you feel?

1073
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,341
Excellent.

1074
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,381
Really excellent.

1075
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:43,541
Remember...

1076
01:39:43,871 --> 01:39:45,541
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1077
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:48,581
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1078
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:50,181
Right.

1079
01:39:50,591 --> 01:39:52,661
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1080
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:55,391
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1081
01:39:56,911 --> 01:39:59,371
- We have a plan.
I know...

1082
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:01,541
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1083
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:05,301
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1084
01:40:06,151 --> 01:40:08,301
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1085
01:40:08,471 --> 01:40:10,541
Or Felix does.

1086
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,061
Hi!

1087
01:40:42,431 --> 01:40:44,061
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1088
01:40:44,231 --> 01:40:48,181
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1089
01:40:48,351 --> 01:40:50,221
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1090
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:53,661
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1091
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:55,821
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1092
01:40:55,991 --> 01:40:58,661
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1093
01:40:58,831 --> 01:41:02,261
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1094
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:04,661
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1095
01:41:04,831 --> 01:41:08,181
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1096
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:11,971
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1097
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:15,301
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1098
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,501
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1099
01:41:20,671 --> 01:41:22,101
Through the front door, sir.

1100
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:24,341
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1101
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:26,141
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1102
01:41:26,311 --> 01:41:28,501
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1103
01:41:29,271 --> 01:41:30,821
Harry!

1104
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:33,981
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1105
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:37,461
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1106
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:40,091
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1107
01:41:45,231 --> 01:41:48,301
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1108
01:41:48,471 --> 01:41:50,141
...back to the castle immediately!

1109
01:41:50,311 --> 01:41:53,421
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1110
01:41:54,711 --> 01:41:56,741
And what makes you say that?

1111
01:41:57,791 --> 01:41:59,301
No idea.

1112
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,141
Horace.

1113
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:12,821
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1114
01:42:13,391 --> 01:42:15,381
A dead one, I think, sir.

1115
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:17,621
Good God.

1116
01:42:18,231 --> 01:42:21,181
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1117
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:24,781
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1118
01:42:24,951 --> 01:42:28,981
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1119
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:32,781
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1120
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:35,061
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1121
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:37,341
Not to mention the pincers.

1122
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:43,341
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1123
01:42:44,031 --> 01:42:47,261
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1124
01:42:47,431 --> 01:42:51,341
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1125
01:42:51,511 --> 01:42:53,621
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1126
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:56,301
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1127
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:59,261
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1128
01:42:59,431 --> 01:43:00,571
My thoughts exactly.

1129
01:43:00,751 --> 01:43:06,981
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1130
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:12,021
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1131
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:15,021
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1132
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:18,701
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1133
01:43:20,071 --> 01:43:21,581
Oh, dear.

1134
01:43:30,911 --> 01:43:33,981
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1135
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:35,701
He had a family, I trust?

1136
01:43:35,871 --> 01:43:37,301
Oh, yeah.

1137
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:43,861
Farewell...

1138
01:43:44,031 --> 01:43:45,821
Aragog.

1139
01:43:50,151 --> 01:43:52,941
Farewell, Aragog...

1140
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:55,871
...king of the arachnids.

1141
01:43:56,671 --> 01:43:59,131
Your body will decay...

1142
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:03,061
...but your spirit lingers on.

1143
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:10,091
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1144
01:44:24,671 --> 01:44:28,141
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1145
01:44:28,311 --> 01:44:31,851
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1146
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:36,971
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1147
01:44:37,151 --> 01:44:42,091
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1148
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:43,781
Poof.

1149
01:44:43,951 --> 01:44:47,021
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1150
01:44:47,191 --> 01:44:50,731
But that's life, I suppose.

1151
01:44:50,911 --> 01:44:56,031
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1152
01:44:56,191 --> 01:44:59,701
- Poof.
- Poof.

1153
01:45:13,671 --> 01:45:16,661
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1154
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:21,741
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1155
01:45:22,631 --> 01:45:25,461
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1156
01:45:26,231 --> 01:45:29,621
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1157
01:45:31,111 --> 01:45:33,461
As I watched, it sank.

1158
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:37,621
Just before it reached the bottom...

1159
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:39,181
...it transformed...

1160
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:42,261
...into a wee fish.

1161
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:45,901
It was beautiful magic.

1162
01:45:46,871 --> 01:45:49,021
Wondrous to behold.

1163
01:45:51,551 --> 01:45:54,181
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1164
01:45:56,471 --> 01:45:57,451
Your mother.

1165
01:45:59,431 --> 01:46:01,811
The day I came downstairs...

1166
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:04,941
...the day the bowl was empty...

1167
01:46:06,431 --> 01:46:08,501
...was the day your mother...

1168
01:46:12,351 --> 01:46:14,261
I know why you're here.

1169
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:19,061
But I can't help you.

1170
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,421
It would ruin me.

1171
01:46:25,991 --> 01:46:28,341
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1172
01:46:28,871 --> 01:46:30,621
The night I got this?

1173
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:33,861
Because of her.

1174
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:36,461
Because she sacrificed herself.

1175
01:46:36,871 --> 01:46:39,141
Because she refused to step aside.

1176
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:42,381
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1177
01:46:42,551 --> 01:46:46,091
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1178
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:48,941
I'm going to tell you something.

1179
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:52,661
Something others have only guessed at.

1180
01:46:54,551 --> 01:46:55,981
It's true.

1181
01:46:56,551 --> 01:46:57,771
I am the Chosen One.

1182
01:46:58,751 --> 01:47:00,861
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1183
01:47:01,031 --> 01:47:04,181
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1184
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:06,621
...and I need to know what you told him.

1185
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:09,611
Be brave, professor.

1186
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:13,181
Be brave like my mother.

1187
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:16,991
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1188
01:47:18,071 --> 01:47:20,261
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1189
01:47:21,231 --> 01:47:26,221
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1190
01:47:36,351 --> 01:47:39,341
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1191
01:47:41,271 --> 01:47:44,421
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1192
01:48:19,671 --> 01:48:22,261
I was in the library the other night...

1193
01:48:22,431 --> 01:48:24,501
...in the Restricted Section...

1194
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:28,821
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1195
01:48:30,071 --> 01:48:32,701
It's called, as I understand it...

1196
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:35,221
...a Horcrux.

1197
01:48:36,991 --> 01:48:39,621
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1198
01:48:40,031 --> 01:48:42,591
I came across the term while reading...

1199
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:45,621
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1200
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:47,461
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1201
01:48:47,631 --> 01:48:50,091
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1202
01:48:50,271 --> 01:48:51,741
Which is...

1203
01:48:52,831 --> 01:48:54,581
...why I came to you.

1204
01:48:57,311 --> 01:49:02,701
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1205
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:05,381
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1206
01:49:07,871 --> 01:49:11,701
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1207
01:49:11,871 --> 01:49:15,341
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1208
01:49:15,511 --> 01:49:16,571
Protected?

1209
01:49:16,751 --> 01:49:19,821
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1210
01:49:21,231 --> 01:49:23,531
In other words, you cannot die.

1211
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:33,461
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1212
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:36,301
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1213
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:38,901
Murder.

1214
01:49:39,391 --> 01:49:40,661
Yes.

1215
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:45,901
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1216
01:49:46,751 --> 01:49:51,301
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1217
01:49:51,471 --> 01:49:52,901
Seven?

1218
01:49:53,631 --> 01:49:58,701
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1219
01:49:58,871 --> 01:50:02,461
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1220
01:50:03,591 --> 01:50:06,501
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1221
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:12,341
Of course, sir.

1222
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:17,101
It'll be our little secret.

1223
01:50:25,551 --> 01:50:26,741
Sir.

1224
01:50:41,511 --> 01:50:43,541
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1225
01:50:43,711 --> 01:50:46,271
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1226
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:49,421
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1227
01:50:49,591 --> 01:50:50,571
What are they exactly?

1228
01:50:50,751 --> 01:50:53,941
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1229
01:50:56,991 --> 01:50:58,621
A ring, for example.

1230
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:00,661
Or a book.

1231
01:51:01,911 --> 01:51:04,181
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1232
01:51:04,671 --> 01:51:06,701
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1233
01:51:06,871 --> 01:51:09,061
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1234
01:51:09,231 --> 01:51:11,061
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1235
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:16,021
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1236
01:51:16,191 --> 01:51:18,101
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1237
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:23,021
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1238
01:51:23,191 --> 01:51:26,891
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1239
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:28,181
One destroys Voldemort.

1240
01:51:28,351 --> 01:51:31,141
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1241
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:34,421
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1242
01:51:47,831 --> 01:51:49,621
...leaves traces.

1243
01:51:57,111 --> 01:51:59,101
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1244
01:51:59,271 --> 01:52:01,461
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1245
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:05,221
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1246
01:52:05,391 --> 01:52:09,301
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1247
01:52:10,791 --> 01:52:15,261
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1248
01:52:19,071 --> 01:52:21,261
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1249
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:23,941
...that you take too much for granted?

1250
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:28,941
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1251
01:52:29,111 --> 01:52:31,141
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1252
01:52:31,991 --> 01:52:37,541
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1253
01:52:55,191 --> 01:52:56,741
Oh, Harry.

1254
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:01,461
You need a shave, my friend.

1255
01:53:04,151 --> 01:53:08,181
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1256
01:53:08,351 --> 01:53:12,131
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1257
01:53:13,631 --> 01:53:15,901
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1258
01:53:16,351 --> 01:53:17,781
I'm an old man.

1259
01:53:17,951 --> 01:53:19,541
You still look the same to me, sir.

1260
01:53:20,951 --> 01:53:23,821
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1261
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:27,061
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1262
01:53:29,711 --> 01:53:34,021
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1263
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:37,541
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1264
01:53:37,711 --> 01:53:39,461
But there is one condition:

1265
01:53:39,631 --> 01:53:42,701
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1266
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:45,101
Yes, sir.

1267
01:53:45,271 --> 01:53:47,301
You do understand what I'm saying?

1268
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:50,251
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1269
01:53:50,431 --> 01:53:52,661
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1270
01:53:52,831 --> 01:53:56,661
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1271
01:54:01,631 --> 01:54:03,141
Your word, Harry.

1272
01:54:04,711 --> 01:54:06,141
My word.

1273
01:54:06,911 --> 01:54:08,501
Take my arm.

1274
01:54:09,871 --> 01:54:12,171
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1275
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:16,141
Well, being me has its privileges.

1276
01:55:01,471 --> 01:55:03,021
This is the place.

1277
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:05,301
Oh, yes.

1278
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:08,651
This place has known magic.

1279
01:55:16,351 --> 01:55:17,821
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1280
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:19,341
...payment must be made.

1281
01:55:19,511 --> 01:55:22,981
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1282
01:55:24,511 --> 01:55:26,261
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1283
01:55:26,711 --> 01:55:29,301
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1284
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:54,741
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1285
01:55:54,911 --> 01:55:58,101
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1286
01:56:00,591 --> 01:56:01,941
Careful.

1287
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,571
There it is.

1288
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:29,621
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1289
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:52,661
If you would, Harry.

1290
01:57:38,031 --> 01:57:40,331
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1291
01:57:40,951 --> 01:57:42,261
Oh, yes.

1292
01:57:52,911 --> 01:57:54,421
It has to be drunk.

1293
01:57:54,591 --> 01:57:57,301
All of it has to be drunk.

1294
01:57:58,111 --> 01:58:01,301
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1295
01:58:01,471 --> 01:58:03,771
This potion might paralyze me.

1296
01:58:04,191 --> 01:58:05,781
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1297
01:58:06,551 --> 01:58:09,701
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1298
01:58:09,951 --> 01:58:11,781
You are not to indulge these requests.

1299
01:58:11,951 --> 01:58:15,341
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1300
01:58:15,511 --> 01:58:17,861
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1301
01:58:18,311 --> 01:58:20,341
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1302
01:58:20,511 --> 01:58:25,701
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1303
01:58:29,471 --> 01:58:31,461
Your good health, Harry.

1304
01:58:46,951 --> 01:58:48,171
Professor.

1305
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:51,371
Professor!

1306
01:58:57,791 --> 01:58:59,221
Harry.

1307
01:58:59,391 --> 01:59:01,771
Professor, can you hear me?

1308
01:59:03,031 --> 01:59:04,141
Professor.

1309
01:59:18,951 --> 01:59:20,011
No. Don't.

1310
01:59:20,191 --> 01:59:22,421
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1311
01:59:31,311 --> 01:59:33,101
Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1312
01:59:33,271 --> 01:59:37,501
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1313
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:39,701
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1314
01:59:39,871 --> 01:59:42,061
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1315
01:59:43,911 --> 01:59:44,941
It's my fault.

1316
01:59:46,551 --> 01:59:47,691
It's all my fault.

1317
01:59:49,471 --> 01:59:51,021
It's my fault.

1318
01:59:51,191 --> 01:59:54,421
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1319
01:59:55,071 --> 01:59:57,301
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1320
01:59:57,471 --> 01:59:59,221
- I promise.
- No.

1321
02:00:00,231 --> 02:00:01,541
Please.

1322
02:00:24,711 --> 02:00:26,101
Harry.

1323
02:00:32,951 --> 02:00:33,931
Water.

1324
02:00:34,911 --> 02:00:35,971
Water.

1325
02:00:36,151 --> 02:00:37,861
Water.

1326
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:45,821
You did it, sir.

1327
02:00:45,991 --> 02:00:47,381
Look.

1328
02:00:49,311 --> 02:00:50,501
Harry.

1329
02:00:51,831 --> 02:00:53,101
Water.

1330
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:56,381
<i>Aguamenti.</i>

1331
02:00:56,591 --> 02:00:57,981
Water.

1332
02:01:32,671 --> 02:01:33,981
<i>Lumos.</i>

1333
02:02:01,271 --> 02:02:03,101
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

1334
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:13,941
Harry.

1335
02:02:17,831 --> 02:02:18,891
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1336
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:20,181
Harry.

1337
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:22,661
<i>- Stupefy!
Harry.</i>

1338
02:03:19,431 --> 02:03:20,651
Harry.

1339
02:03:24,511 --> 02:03:26,741
<i>Partis Temporus!</i>

1340
02:04:07,551 --> 02:04:10,541
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1341
02:04:49,711 --> 02:04:53,251
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1342
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:56,901
No.

1343
02:04:57,911 --> 02:05:00,471
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1344
02:05:00,631 --> 02:05:04,021
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1345
02:05:04,191 --> 02:05:05,781
Speak to no one else.

1346
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:08,501
Severus, Harry.

1347
02:05:13,591 --> 02:05:15,891
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1348
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:20,181
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1349
02:05:20,351 --> 02:05:23,971
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1350
02:05:24,751 --> 02:05:26,341
Harry, do as I say.

1351
02:05:29,831 --> 02:05:31,051
Trust me.

1352
02:05:32,751 --> 02:05:34,141
Trust me.

1353
02:05:53,871 --> 02:05:55,621
Good evening, Draco.

1354
02:05:56,471 --> 02:05:59,861
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1355
02:06:00,031 --> 02:06:01,701
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1356
02:06:01,871 --> 02:06:05,781
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1357
02:06:07,831 --> 02:06:10,541
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1358
02:06:12,951 --> 02:06:14,341
Draco...

1359
02:06:14,991 --> 02:06:17,821
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1360
02:06:17,991 --> 02:06:19,701
I've done things that would shock you.

1361
02:06:19,871 --> 02:06:23,821
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1362
02:06:23,991 --> 02:06:26,501
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1363
02:06:26,671 --> 02:06:28,181
Forgive me, Draco.

1364
02:06:28,351 --> 02:06:30,731
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1365
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:33,181
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1366
02:06:33,351 --> 02:06:36,421
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1367
02:06:40,071 --> 02:06:41,781
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1368
02:06:41,951 --> 02:06:43,541
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1369
02:06:46,751 --> 02:06:48,981
Very good. Very good.

1370
02:06:50,671 --> 02:06:52,061
You're not alone.

1371
02:06:53,111 --> 02:06:54,091
There are others.

1372
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:57,421
How?

1373
02:06:58,671 --> 02:07:01,231
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1374
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:04,221
- I've been mending it.
Let me guess.

1375
02:07:04,391 --> 02:07:07,221
It has a sister. A twin.

1376
02:07:07,391 --> 02:07:09,501
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1377
02:07:09,671 --> 02:07:11,381
Ingenious.

1378
02:07:12,031 --> 02:07:13,221
Draco...

1379
02:07:13,391 --> 02:07:19,221
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1380
02:07:20,111 --> 02:07:22,901
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1381
02:07:23,671 --> 02:07:27,021
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1382
02:07:28,191 --> 02:07:29,781
I have to kill you.

1383
02:07:30,391 --> 02:07:32,341
Or he's gonna kill me.

1384
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:44,941
Well, look what we have here.

1385
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:48,821
Well done, Draco.

1386
02:07:52,351 --> 02:07:54,101
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1387
02:07:55,111 --> 02:07:57,181
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1388
02:07:57,351 --> 02:08:02,261
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1389
02:08:02,871 --> 02:08:04,181
Do it.

1390
02:08:05,431 --> 02:08:09,381
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1391
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:11,221
Let me finish him in my own way.

1392
02:08:11,391 --> 02:08:14,861
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1393
02:08:15,031 --> 02:08:16,981
This is your moment. Do it.

1394
02:08:18,471 --> 02:08:20,381
Go on, Draco.

1395
02:08:20,551 --> 02:08:22,621
Now!

1396
02:08:23,831 --> 02:08:25,101
No.

1397
02:08:36,511 --> 02:08:37,981
Severus.

1398
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:48,021
Please.

1399
02:08:48,991 --> 02:08:50,261
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1400
02:09:31,471 --> 02:09:34,581
Yeah!

1401
02:09:52,031 --> 02:09:55,341
Hagrid! Hello?

1402
02:09:55,511 --> 02:09:59,381
Snape! He trusted you!

1403
02:10:03,551 --> 02:10:05,101
Go on.

1404
02:10:05,751 --> 02:10:07,381
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1405
02:10:07,551 --> 02:10:10,111
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1406
02:10:11,671 --> 02:10:14,741
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1407
02:10:34,071 --> 02:10:35,381
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1408
02:10:43,511 --> 02:10:48,531
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1409
02:10:49,271 --> 02:10:50,381
Yes.

1410
02:10:51,071 --> 02:10:55,061
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1411
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:35,181
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1412
02:14:35,871 --> 02:14:38,251
...in light of what has happened...

1413
02:14:39,631 --> 02:14:42,781
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1414
02:14:44,671 --> 02:14:48,501
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1415
02:14:50,271 --> 02:14:52,621
...you meant a great deal to him.

1416
02:15:10,151 --> 02:15:12,221
Do you think he would've done it?

1417
02:15:12,391 --> 02:15:14,181
Draco?

1418
02:15:15,231 --> 02:15:16,501
No.

1419
02:15:17,631 --> 02:15:19,581
No, he was lowering his wand.

1420
02:15:20,591 --> 02:15:22,461
In the end, it was Snape.

1421
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:25,421
It was always Snape.

1422
02:15:25,591 --> 02:15:27,701
And I did nothing.

1423
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:35,461
It's fake.

1424
02:15:36,991 --> 02:15:38,261
Open it.

1425
02:15:48,831 --> 02:15:52,661
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1426
02:15:52,831 --> 02:15:56,341
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1427
02:15:57,311 --> 02:16:01,011
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1428
02:16:01,191 --> 02:16:04,101
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1429
02:16:04,271 --> 02:16:06,421
...you will be mortal once more.

1430
02:16:07,671 --> 02:16:09,261
R.A.B."

1431
02:16:10,471 --> 02:16:11,861
R.A.B.

1432
02:16:12,231 --> 02:16:13,451
Don't know.

1433
02:16:15,391 --> 02:16:17,951
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1434
02:16:18,871 --> 02:16:20,341
Which means it was all a waste.

1435
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:23,061
All of it.

1436
02:16:29,031 --> 02:16:31,021
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1437
02:16:31,511 --> 02:16:32,941
You and Ginny.

1438
02:16:33,551 --> 02:16:37,091
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1439
02:16:38,391 --> 02:16:40,301
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1440
02:16:41,431 --> 02:16:44,021
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1441
02:16:44,191 --> 02:16:46,901
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1442
02:16:47,071 --> 02:16:50,541
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1443
02:16:51,831 --> 02:16:54,341
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1444
02:16:54,511 --> 02:16:57,071
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1445
02:16:59,991 --> 02:17:02,141
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1446
02:17:02,311 --> 02:17:04,581
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1447
02:17:08,671 --> 02:17:10,261
You need us, Harry.

1448
02:17:25,431 --> 02:17:28,381
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.

1449
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,148
