1
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,470
Let me tell you about my day so far.

2
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,470
Coffee in Paris,
surfed the Maldives...

3
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,980
took a little nap
on Mount Kilimanjaro.

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,980
Oh, yeah, and I got digits
from this Polish chick in Rio.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,980
And then I jumped back...

6
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,710
for the final quarter of the N.B.A. Finals
- courtside, of course.

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,720
And all that was before lunch.

8
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,720
I could go on,
but all I'm saying is...

9
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,790
I'm standing on top of the world.

10
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,165
The lighter terrain here-

11
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:10,995
It wasn't always like this.

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,140
Once I was a normal person,
a chump just like you.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,380
- Hey, Millie.
- Oh, hey, David.

14
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,040
You got a lot of cities there.

15
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,120
Well, if you're gonna have a dream,
might as well dream big, right?

16
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,120
Right.

17
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,122
See you later.

18
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,800
Hey, Millie.

19
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,865
Give me a sec.
Hey.

20
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,905
I wanted to give you this.
I picked it up at a yard sale in Plymouth.

21
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:57,982
I- I thought you'd really like it.

22
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:06,385
It's a little dinged up
and it's missing a few steps, but-

23
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,289
I love it.

24
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,920
- You do?
- I do.

25
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,555
Holy crap, Rice Bowll

26
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,499
- Mark.
- Hey, what's this?

27
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:19,502
- Christmas come early?
- Mark, stop it.

28
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:21,731
- Mark, give it back to her.
- Holy crap!

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,832
Look what David got Millie!
You guys like the Eiffel Tower?

30
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:28,572
Wow, if you shake this thing hard enough,
you can hear the Eiffel Tower move.

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,979
- Hey, who wants to give it a shake?
- Okay, that's enough!

32
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,449
- Stop it. Just give it back.
- All right.

33
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,520
Okay, I'm sorry.
Here.

34
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:46,292
Sorry, buddy.
Guess I don't know my own strength.

35
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,431
- I can't believe you're such a jerk!
- I was just playing around.

36
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:54,596
- It wasn't funny.
- They thought it was pretty funny.

37
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:57,732
David?

38
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,538
David, don't go out there.
It's not safe.

39
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,545
David, just forget about it.

40
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,979
Come on, Rice Bowl!
Don't be stupid!

41
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,416
David, come back. Come on.
Just let it go. It's okay!

42
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:12,920
Stop! It's not worth it.
Just come back. Please?

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,821
Come on, David!

44
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,230
Be careful. Come on.

45
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:23,664
- All good. See?
- Great. Now come back.

46
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:29,571
- David!
- Millie, don't go out there!

47
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:34,077
David! David! Somebody-

48
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:37,579
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,742
- David- Get help!
- Millie, get back here!

50
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,719
Please help! David!

51
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:46,551
- Call 911! David!
- You can't help him!

52
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,387
- Millie, stop, stop, stop!
- David!

53
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,718
And that's how it happened the first time.

54
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,449
One second I'm a goner, and the next thing
I know I'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library.

55
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,065
Home, sweet home.

56
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,769
Mom left when I was five.

57
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:43,836
As for Dad, well, let's just say
he wasn't much of one.

58
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:51,253
You're late.
Supper's cold.

59
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,521
Where you been, anyway?

60
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,632
You know, when I ask a question,
I expect an answer. Okay?

61
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,895
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened to you?

62
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,971
Just kids at school.

63
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:13,806
Hey, David, get back down here,
get a mop and clean this crap up!

64
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,811
David!

65
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:18,006
Don't make me come up there!

66
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,607
David?
Make the right choice!

67
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:23,812
David! David.

68
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,980
Open the door.

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,077
Did I just teleport?

70
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,986
Great.

71
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,520
I teleported to the library.

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,854
Look-No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you say.

73
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,654
And that's when it occurred to me.

74
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:40,219
This thing that just happened,
it could set me free.

75
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,109
And if she could run away,
so could I.

76
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,082
You're okay.

77
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,518
I wanted to tell her everything.

78
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,597
David?

79
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,932
David?

80
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,662
I mean, who would have believed me anyway?

81
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,702
David!

82
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:57,774
I figured it was time to move on.

83
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,903
Uh, I'd like a room.

84
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:29,336
You're not gonna be any trouble,
are you? No weird stuff?

85
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,137
Nope.
No weird stuff.

86
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:54,063
And so there I was.

87
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:57,828
I had a million questions,
like how does this thing work?

88
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:59,903
How do I control it?

89
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,077
Been there.

90
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:52,155
Mommy, you can see
the ocean and everything!

91
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,816
If we're lucky,
maybe we'll see King Kong.

92
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,825
Really?

93
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:00,363
- You got me?
- Oh, I got you. I'm not letting you go.

94
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:27,386
I was 15.

95
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:31,018
Come on.
What would you have done?

96
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:34,097
I figured I'd pay it back someday.

97
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,039
Is there a bathroom for customers?

98
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:56,381
Hey.
It's this way.

99
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,455
Yeah.

100
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,557
Make it quick.

101
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,786
No problem.
Thanks.

102
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,696
I'm gonna need a bigger bag.

109
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,368
Holy shit.

110
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,437
Whoo!

111
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,574
Hey!

112
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:30,136
I said no weird stuff.
Let's go- two days' rent. You owe me rent.

113
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:32,147
Hello? Hello?

114
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,968
The police and the F.B.I.
Have already been through here.

115
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,595
- Who are you with?
- N.S.A.

116
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:58,106
They couldn't make
heads or tails of it.

117
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,610
The vault has a time lock,
pressure mounts, steel plates.

118
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,612
- This guy didn't open a door.
- Open a door?

119
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,615
We didn't know we were robbed
until halfway through the day.

120
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,083
I want the security tapes
for the whole month.

121
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:13,088
And I need the name of everyone who has
a safety deposit box in that vault.

122
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,182
That's confidential.
Why do you need those names?

123
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,694
Whoever robbed your vault
has been in it before.

124
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:22,857
Now, I want those names,
and I want those tapes.

125
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,867
Today.

126
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:44,315
So the story had a happy ending.

127
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:48,118
Rice Bowl was dead,
but I had never been more alive.

128
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,627
So now I'm living in New York.

129
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,129
But why settle in one place...

130
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,529
when you can have the whole world?

136
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,251
She floats into the river.

137
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,851
But as you can see, this flood became
more severe about 10 minutes ago.

138
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:29,091
The question now, Pat, is,
what will happen to these people?

139
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,292
It would take a miracle
to get to them.

140
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,621
Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.

141
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,461
- How they doin'?
- Down by six at the half.

142
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,468
Don't think you'll be
needing that umbrella.

143
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,800
You never know.

144
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:55,884
- Watch it!
- You mind if I join you?

145
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:58,614
- No.
- What are you drinking?

146
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:00,451
Gin and tonic.

147
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:04,891
Uh, Tanqueray and tonic.
Two of 'em, please.

148
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:11,757
So, you live in London?

150
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,496
- Taxi!

153
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,298
Shit.

154
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,879
Dude, this totally sucks.

155
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:00,415
Hey, I thought this was where the storm
was supposed to hit.

156
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:03,179
- I heard it hit Fiji.
- Fiji, huh?

157
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,051
Yeah. They got,
like, 30-foot swells.

158
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:07,817
Really?

159
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,431
Wh-Whoa!

160
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:10,979
Let's go.

161
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:21,322
ｿPor qu

162
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:25,128
Because you are an abomination.

163
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:31,332
Only God should have the power...

164
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,205
to be all places at all times.

165
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:57,500
One less of you to worry about.

166
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,565
Cut him down!

167
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,301
Let's get the hell out of here.

168
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,604
Yeah?

169
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,612
We have a lead on the bank, sir.

170
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,239
I'll be on the next plane.

171
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:22,023
Hey, Angelo.
How'd they do?

172
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,025
- Not so good.
- Ah.

173
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:28,086
- Told you you wouldn't be needing that
umbrella. - Yeah. You were right.

174
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,210
Don't run.

175
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,690
Eight years
we've been looking for you.

176
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,925
And who are you?

177
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,998
My name's Roland.

178
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,426
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- Oh, we'll get to that.

179
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:13,106
What kind of crook...

180
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,178
leaves a note?

181
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:21,016
- I think I need to talk to my lawyers.
- Why?

182
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,847
You're not under arrest.

183
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:26,013
- You mean you're not the-
- Police? Mm-mmm.

184
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,023
Anybody can rob a bank.

185
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,617
What I'd like to know is how you
rob a bank without opening any doors.

186
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:33,628
Come on.

187
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,631
I'm sure you can think of something.

188
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,634
Look, uh,
if you're not the police...

189
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:43,433
and I'm not under arrest...

190
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,069
I think I'd like you to leave.

191
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:54,114
You need some help with that?

192
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,687
Been a while
since you used a door, huh?

193
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,760
Oh, I know who you are.

194
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:07,557
And I know what you are.

195
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,766
This conversation's over-

196
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,166
This conversation's not over...

197
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,171
until you answer my question!

198
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,606
Tell me, how'd you
last this long? Huh?

199
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,546
Who's helping you?

200
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,187
Jumpers.

201
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:42,461
Kinda hard to jump with 1,000 volts of
electricity passing through your brain, huh?

202
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,661
Perfect!

203
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:52,909
Who's protecting you?
Give me an answer so I can go home.

204
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,103
I hate Jumpers.

205
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:10,090
You think you could
go on like this forever...

206
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:14,630
living like this
with no consequences? Hmm?

207
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,934
There are always consequences.

208
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:27,403
Where you goin', huh?
I've got you now.

209
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,577
You think you can hide behind a wall,
go anywhere, do anything?

210
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,919
Not anymore!

211
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,334
Currently 66 degrees in-

212
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,803
David? David!

213
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,936
That you?

214
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:05,173
David! David!
Don't go!

215
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,183
Don't go. Just-Just-
Just hear me out.

216
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,310
Okay?

217
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,320
David-

218
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:16,449
I- I don't know if
I'm going crazy here or not.

219
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,859
I don't know a lot of things these days,
but if you can hear me-

220
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,955
Just wait, David! Don't go!
I gotta talk to ya!

221
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,567
David, if you can hear me, Son...

222
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,606
it's okay.

223
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,675
You can come home...

224
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,744
anytime you want.

225
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:42,208
You're not crazy.

226
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,387
- Telecommunications.
- This is Roland.

227
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,428
He got away.

228
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,930
We have his jump sites.

229
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:59,996
I want everybody up and running.

230
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,003
Everybody.

231
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:06,064
Picking up transmission.

232
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,458
Who is this?

233
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,781
May I help you?

234
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,408
Yeah, uh-

235
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,955
Hi, Mrs. Harris.
It's me, David.

236
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:29,082
David?
David Rice?

237
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,285
Millie was right.
You're not-

238
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:33,954
Dead. Yeah.
No, I'm not.

239
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,560
Actually, I was hoping
you could tell me where to find Millie.

240
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,036
Millie. She's got her own place
over on Morton.

241
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,039
Number 260.

242
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,200
- She's still here?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

243
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,507
She works at Houlihan's Bar
down by the campus.

244
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:53,613
That's it!

245
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:01,515
He's carried the ball 20 times.

246
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,650
Millie, need those pitchers.

247
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,770
Okay, you saw her.

248
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:25,906
Holy crap!
Rice Bowl?

249
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:30,509
Mark!
Mark Kobold!

250
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,020
Sorry, man.
I don't know you.

251
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:36,149
Jesus Christ!
Am I seeing a ghost?

252
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,625
Is this some kind of
sixth-sense shit?

253
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:41,697
I don't know what you're
talking about. Okay?

254
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,924
Hey! Everybody!
It's Rice Bowl!

255
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:48,596
Come on, don't you wanna grab a beer
with an old buddy from high school?

256
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,367
- I'm not this David-
- David?

257
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,077
Yo, it's the Rice Cake.

258
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,476
- Millie?
- Hi!

259
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,848
You were gonna leave
without saying anything?

260
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:05,853
Uh-

261
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:08,549
- Sorry. I didn't see you.
- No?

262
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:11,786
Weren't you just up there
staring at me for the past 45 minutes?

263
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:15,597
Yeah, David.
Why didn't you say somethin'?

264
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,998
- I think you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk. Okay? I'm cool.

265
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:21,900
I am totally, 110% cool.

266
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:25,805
Yeah, that was really cool. Why don't you
go find a bench and sleep it off. Okay?

267
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,640
Why don't you go make me
a drink, sweetheart? Huh?

268
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,407
A little splash of that.

269
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:33,880
Hey! No!

270
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:36,645
Fight! Come on! Fight!

271
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:39,119
Come on.

272
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,590
- Mark!
- Come on, man!

273
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,660
- Stop it, you guys!
- Yeah!

274
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:48,128
Rice Bowl goes down!
Whoo!

275
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,335
Whoo!

276
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:03,134
Wh-What did you do to me?

277
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,214
Freak!

278
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,847
Guess I don't know my own strength.

279
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,456
Hey, wh-

280
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,365
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Hey.

281
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,370
Yeah.

282
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:31,963
Where's Mark?

283
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,305
- He took off.
- What?

284
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:37,847
Yeah, I don't think, uh, he's gonna
come back anytime soon.

285
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:40,211
Oh.

286
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,680
Bleeding a little.

287
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,190
We should take care of that.

288
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,260
Come on.

289
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:08,409
So, you saw me as soon as I came in?

290
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,479
Maybe.

291
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:15,550
I didn't know what to say.

292
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:20,112
How about, "Hi. Hello.
Been a long time. How are you?"

293
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:26,361
- Hi.
- Hello.

294
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,057
- Been a long time. How are you?
- I'm good.

295
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:31,065
How are you?

296
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,863
Why don't we skip this boring stuff?

297
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,837
You know, I didn't think,
uh, you'd still be here.

298
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,843
Where else would I be?

299
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,845
You had those lists, right?

300
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:47,075
And you were gonna
go travel the world and-

301
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:51,615
Things change.
We all need to grow up, right?

302
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,057
So what do you do?

303
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,920
Banking.
I'm in banking.

304
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,725
In banking?
How'd you get into that?

305
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:06,632
It's pretty easy, actually.
I just sort of landed in it.

306
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:08,101
Didn't you flunk algebra?

307
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,967
No.

308
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:15,044
- Fiona, I'm gonna take my break now.
- Yeah, sure. You bet.

309
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:21,374
So, you're back.

310
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,452
What now?
What's your plan?

311
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:26,746
Maybe gonna do some traveling.

312
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:35,158
I was thinking of maybe
checking out Rome, actually.

313
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:40,435
You were thinking
of checking out Rome?

314
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:43,506
You know that was my dream.
Don't try to rip me off. Okay?

315
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,809
- So come with me.
- So come with you?

316
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:52,109
- You're asking me to go to Rome?
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,776
I mean, only if you want to
skip the boring parts.

318
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:36,521
I got it.
I'll take it!

319
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,321
- Thank you.
- As you like.

320
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:39,895
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:45,056
Can you believe just 10 hours ago
we were in Ann Arbor?

322
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:47,102
Yeah.

323
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,636
What does the C.I.A. Want with this?

324
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,139
I'm afraid that's classified.

325
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,141
Really?

326
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:57,576
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to see a federal warrant.

327
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,148
'Cause I don't believe you are
who you say you are.

328
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,910
Certainly.

329
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,929
Great.
Another cop.

330
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:26,437
So, Mark, tell me
what happened at the bank.

331
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,442
I told them already.

332
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:31,604
You're just another suit.
You're never gonna believe me.

333
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,518
It says here you were
beamed into the vault.

334
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:44,891
You wanna laugh about it?
Go ahead. Have a laugh.

335
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,095
You hear me laughing?

336
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
The girl's name is Millie Harris.

337
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:57,162
She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago,
and she didn't go alone.

338
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:15,089
So, what do you think?

339
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:23,658
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

340
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,663
What do you mean?

341
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,739
This room.

342
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:33,809
First class.

343
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:38,578
Usually in my life,
when things seem too good to be true...

344
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,581
it's because they are.

345
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:43,652
- I told you, I'm in banki-
- Banking?

346
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:50,457
See, I know
that you flunked algebra.

347
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,326
If you don't wanna
tell me everything, that's fine.

348
00:33:55,765 --> 00:33:58,256
But just don't lie to me.

349
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,969
I'm not lying to you.

350
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:04,039
No?

351
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,949
Good.

352
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,434
Can't... reach it.

367
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,347
I could eat.

368
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:27,582
You know, you could've just
asked me out on a date.

373
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,165
- Grazie.

377
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:54,779
You know, this has always been
number one on my list.

378
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:56,784
I know.

379
00:35:56,886 --> 00:36:00,014
You must be pretty good
at this, huh?

380
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:03,091
Good at what?

383
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
- Rookie.

384
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:17,298
- No idea.

385
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:20,137
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

386
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,143
- W-W-W-W-Wait!
- Sorry, sir.

387
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,146
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. No. No.
It's impossible. - What?

388
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:29,275
- It's closed. - What do you mean,
it's closed? How is it closed?

389
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:33,253
- We just wanna go inside there.
- No, it's impossible. No, no.

390
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:35,984
- It's the Colosseum. How is it closed?
- It's impossible.

391
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:40,085
David, it's okay. I got to see it
from outside. That's good enough.

392
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:44,064
- You know, she came all this way
to go inside. - Hey, come on.

393
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,100
Sorry, he's- I don't know.

394
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,170
- Ciao.
- Bye.

395
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:55,509
Millie!

396
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,670
- Come on.
- What?

397
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,805
Come on.
How about a private tour?

398
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,976
It's closed. We can't
break into the Colosseum.

399
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:06,543
Who said it's closed?
The door was open.

400
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,624
Wanna see the Colosseum or not?

401
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,861
Come on.

402
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,430
We so should not be doing this.

403
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:41,924
This place is amazing.

404
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:44,015
I wanted you to see this.

405
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:46,924
You've gotta admit,
it's worth the risk.

406
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:49,932
Yeah.

407
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,339
- It's so cool!
- It is.

408
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:08,510
Down here is where they used to keep
the gladiators and the lions in cages?

409
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:12,178
- We should go down there.
- Can't go down there. It's off-limits.

410
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:14,882
- Even when it's open.
- Nothing's off-limits.

411
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,754
What?

412
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,259
Psst! Millie!

413
00:38:26,502 --> 00:38:29,198
Did that door just open too?

414
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:31,239
- It's open now.
- Yeah.

415
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,106
You're gonna want to see this.
Trust me.

416
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,793
Bet you that's worth something.

417
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,192
Maybe.

418
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:04,065
Uh-oh.

419
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,300
I think he's telling you
do not enter.

420
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:10,505
You speak Italian?

421
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,513
No.

422
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:14,515
- Well, uh, L'ingresso...
- Uh-huh?

423
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,517
Means "come on in. "

424
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,850
Oh! I thought it meant "bullshit. "

425
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:22,856
Well, no, that means that you should
stay here while I go around...

426
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,358
and open it from the other side.

427
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,361
It's all right.
You'll catch on.

428
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,431
Mmm.

429
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:44,638
Thank you very much.
Next showing will be at 6:00.

430
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:47,807
Don't forget to tip your usher.

431
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:51,549
- Oh, uh-
- Uh, do you mind, man?

432
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:54,214
- Whoa!
- Just a little privacy, eh?

433
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:55,881
- Sorry, man.
- Big Colosseum. Guy peein'?

434
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:59,449
This isn't a fashion show.
I'm taking a piss. Do you mind?

435
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,290
Place is all yours.

436
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:11,634
Wouldn't open that door if I were you, not
if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing.

437
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,301
What are you gonna do anyway? Bring
her down, have a nice, romantic picnic?

438
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:18,312
Nice little tea party?
Is that what you think is gonna happen?

439
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:21,178
- If you so much as look at her wrong-
- You gonna jump me? Where?

440
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,488
Did you think you were the only one?

441
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:30,082
You really have no idea, do you?

442
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:32,092
You lead the life you live.

443
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:35,027
You think you can just go on a little
Roman holiday and they wouldn't notice?

444
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:37,031
Just jump
all over the place-

445
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,033
jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump-

446
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,103
and nothing's gonna happen?

447
00:40:42,471 --> 00:40:44,871
Well, they've noticed.

448
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,601
Not me.

449
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,371
I mean I already knew.
I'm not talking about me, but them.

450
00:40:49,478 --> 00:40:51,446
Down there.

451
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:56,785
Hello, boys.

452
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,190
Just me, then.

453
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,749
Huh. That's new.

454
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,941
Welcome to the war.

455
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,055
Just let me know if you guys
are gettin' tired.

456
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:41,062
- Close.
- David?

457
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,067
What's going on?

458
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:52,899
Great. Let's meet
the girlfriend, shall we?

459
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:55,067
No.

460
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:10,023
Who are these people?

461
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,025
Paladins.
Paladins kill Jumpers.

462
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:13,924
I kill Paladins.
Class dismissed.

463
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:21,936
Polizia! Polizia!

464
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:23,698
- Polizia!
- Uh-oh.

465
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:27,271
Wait!

466
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:36,509
I just came through your jump scar.

467
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:39,520
What do you think
you're doing here? Huh?

468
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:42,022
If I were you, I'd jump right back.

469
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,854
You're not supposed to see
all this stuff. Get out!

470
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:51,628
So if you'd like to
kindly fuck off, as in now.

471
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,168
Maybe your girlfriend's still alive.

472
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:59,068
- Hey.
- Hey.

473
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:02,734
- What happened to you?
- Uh, nothing.

474
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:05,973
Let's go. Come on.
I think we should just get out of here.

475
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,311
That didn't sound like nothing.

476
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:12,148
You were right. Okay? I shouldn't have
gone down there. Everything's fine.

477
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:15,246
Come on. We can
still make the museum.

478
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:22,663
David?

479
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:24,665
Will you talk to me?
Please?

480
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,667
Must be a cab around here somewhere.

481
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:29,169
Why aren't you talking to me?
Please talk to me.

482
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,672
- I'll tell you everything back at the hotel
Okay? - I'm not waiting for the hotel.

483
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:36,006
- Look, Millie, it's, uh- it's all
fine. Okay? - No, it's not all fine.

484
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:39,376
I wasn't supposed to go back there.

485
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:42,678
Huh?

486
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:44,685
Uh, no comprende.

487
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:47,551
No, I think you guys made a mistake.

488
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:50,181
- Be quiet.
- You're looking for that guy over there.

489
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:54,456
I'm sorry. I know I wasn't
supposed to be back there.

490
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,692
Calma, calma, calma, calma.

491
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:01,429
Can't you just let us off with a warning-
Whoa! Okay, okay.

492
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:03,767
Okay, okay, okay.

493
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:06,966
- Millie, just go back to the hotel. Okay?
- No-

494
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:10,045
- No, no, we're not together.
- I'm with him!

495
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:12,443
I don't know her.
Millie, go back to the hotel.

496
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:15,949
No. No.

497
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:20,884
I told you.
I want to see Millie.

498
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:24,254
- Where is the body?
- I didn't do anything, okay?

499
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,386
I- I don't know how many times
you want me to tell you the same thing.

500
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,728
Do you know how much longer
he's gonna be back there?

501
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:35,804
We wait for magistrato.

502
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:38,930
Yeah. I know. We've been waiting for
a magistrato all night.

503
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:45,642
I don't speak your-
I don't know what you're saying.

504
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,807
Now you "seat," or we seat you.

505
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,907
- Okay.
- Seat!

506
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:52,145
I seat.

507
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:54,347
She's got nothing to do with this.

508
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,624
Allora, the magistrate is here.
We will hold on to your passport.

509
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:05,825
Don't worry.
You won't need it where you're going.

510
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,139
Hello, David.

511
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:23,707
You've only got about 30 seconds before
they come through that door. You understand?

512
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,787
You have to get out of here.

513
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:28,618
- Ditch the girl. If she's with you,
she's dead. - Mom.

514
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:31,625
- Mom.
- Twenty seconds, David.

515
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:37,064
Mom! Mom!

516
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,190
Hey!

517
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:53,481
Millie.

518
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:57,547
All done. You okay?

519
00:45:57,653 --> 00:45:59,621
Mm-hmm. Hey.

520
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:02,519
- I'm free to walk.
- They just let you go?

521
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:05,457
- They just let me go.
- Just like that?

522
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:08,223
Just like that.
Come on.

523
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:12,431
If they just let you go,
why are we running?

524
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:15,264
Well, uh, they really strongly suggested
that we leave town now.

525
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,669
- But what did they say to you?
- Asked me some questions.

526
00:46:18,774 --> 00:46:21,834
- For eight hours?
- They had a lot of questions.

527
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:24,378
I really want to trust you.
You're making it extremely difficult.

528
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,380
All right. So trust me.
Let's go.

529
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:31,719
Whoa!

530
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:34,855
Whoa! Hey.

531
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:37,755
Can you take us? Yeah?

532
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,057
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.

533
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:46,225
Please.
Please get in the cab.

534
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:15,695
That's yours.

535
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:18,265
Remember how I told you you didn't
need to tell me everything?

536
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,603
I changed my mind.

537
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,676
What's in the backpack?

538
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,802
Where did you get that?

539
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:04,070
I don't want to lie to you.

540
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:09,313
But you don't want to
tell me the truth either.

541
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:15,116
I can't get on this flight
with you, Millie.

542
00:48:15,223 --> 00:48:18,386
This is as far as we go together.

543
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:36,608
- To Detroit?
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,680
Roland.

545
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,756
We lost him, sir.

546
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,859
- How many did you send?
- Two men.

547
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,952
- I told you to send everybody.
- Well, she said two would be enough...

548
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:56,997
but, uh, they missed him.

549
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,761
It's like he knew we were coming.

550
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,666
We're searching the grid now.

551
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,502
Keep me informed.
I'm taking a different tack.

552
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,889
William Rice?

553
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,480
Yeah.

554
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:25,560
I.R.S.

555
00:49:26,828 --> 00:49:30,161
Could we, uh, go inside and talk?

556
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:35,132
I don't have to ask.
That's a courtesy.

557
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:38,468
So, what's this all about?

558
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:40,734
Your son. David.

559
00:49:42,711 --> 00:49:45,805
Why? Is he in some kind
of trouble or something?

560
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:52,016
This will go a lot swifter
if you let me ask the questions.

561
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,021
When's the last time
you saw your son?

562
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:58,592
Eight years ago.

563
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:03,064
Eight years?

564
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,133
That's right.

565
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:09,768
What about friends?

566
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:11,771
Anybody I can talk to?

567
00:50:11,873 --> 00:50:14,068
He didn't have
a whole lot of friends.

568
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,838
I'd like to talk to
David's mother if I could.

569
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:21,006
Yeah, me too.
If you find her, tell her I said hello.

570
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,084
That her?

571
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:25,346
Mary Rice. At least that was
her name back then.

572
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:32,191
When's the last time you saw her?

573
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:34,762
She split when the kid turned five.

574
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:36,763
Five. Oh.

575
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:38,958
Haven't heard a word since.

576
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:48,535
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to give you a holler.

577
00:50:53,749 --> 00:50:56,741
- No, you won't.
- No. I won't.

578
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:02,582
Have you seen the special move
you can do on this new thing?

579
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:07,219
They've added this new control and, like,
you just- Just double-click it. See that?

580
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:09,229
What do you say?
Whoa.

581
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,801
Still alive, are ya?

582
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:22,304
- I'm hit!
- He's dead.

583
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,345
- What? That's just great.
- There's more of them?

584
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:29,508
Hundreds more. I'm tracking 10 right now.
What do you care? There's lots more.

585
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,348
- What about the rest?
- What about the rest?

586
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:34,513
Like I said, I hunt them.

587
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:36,591
- Start again.
- So who are these guys?

588
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:38,420
I told you.
They're Paladins.

589
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:42,122
Yeah, you told me their name.
You didn't tell me what they want.

590
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,688
Well, it's pretty simple,
isn't it? They want us dead.

591
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,929
- Didn't you figure that out yet?
- Yeah. No, I got that much.

592
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:50,937
- Good. I'm glad.
- Yeah. Thanks.

593
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:52,973
- Do you mind just, uh-
- Why?

594
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:54,974
Because we can do
whatever the hell we want.

595
00:51:55,076 --> 00:51:56,976
- Now can you please just-
- I'm hit!

596
00:51:57,078 --> 00:52:00,377
- He's dead.
- Great. Thanks.

597
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:02,712
You really don't get it, do you?

598
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,810
Paladins have been killing
Jumpers for years.

599
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,821
Way back since medieval times.

600
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:11,217
They're fanatics.
Religious nut jobs.

601
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:14,056
Inquisition. Witch hunts.
That was them.

602
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:18,121
Look. They're smart.
They're fast. They're organized.

603
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,667
No matter what, they'll kill anyone
that gets in their way.

604
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:24,569
Like your family.
Your friends.

605
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:28,404
That little girlfriend
you're traipsing around Rome with you.

606
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,742
They're dead.
All of 'em.

607
00:52:32,848 --> 00:52:35,442
Get used to it.
It's just a matter of time.

608
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,348
I'm gonna get some takeaway.
Do you want some?

609
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:15,950
He's your father.

610
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:19,117
I'm sorry. I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.

611
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:22,754
He can be so stubborn. I don't
know how my mother puts up with him.

612
00:53:36,978 --> 00:53:39,105
Somebody get some help!

613
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:43,043
- Now!
- What happened?

614
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:45,551
What's going on in here?

615
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,219
Get the paddles.

616
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:56,594
You okay? Stay still.

617
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,168
I'm not getting a pulse.

618
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:05,840
What the hell happened here?

619
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,810
Oh!

620
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:13,643
Mark.

621
00:54:13,748 --> 00:54:16,182
- Jesus Christ.
- What did you tell him?

622
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:18,275
- How did they know about Ann Arbor?
- Don't touch me.

623
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:21,048
- Who'd you tell?
- Stay the hell away from me.

624
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:24,182
Was it a black guy with white hair?
Was his name Roland?

625
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:26,192
Just answer the question...

626
00:54:26,294 --> 00:54:28,489
or I'll drop you off the top
of Mount Everest, okay?

627
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:30,496
- What? What?
- What did you tell him?

628
00:54:30,598 --> 00:54:32,930
I don't-What? Tell what?

629
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:34,934
I know you told him
about home, all right?

630
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,903
I know you told him about Ann Arbor.
Did you tell him about Millie?

631
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:39,667
I told him everything.

632
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:42,004
Why?
Why did you do that?

633
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,408
Why not?

634
00:54:44,512 --> 00:54:46,446
Who are you?

635
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:55,281
Whoa! Whew!

636
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,290
Where'd the Paladin go?

637
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:59,860
- Swimming.
- Pacific?

638
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:03,556
No. Actually, Atlantic.
Nice little shark pit round Cuba.

639
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,563
Uh, what do you think you're doing?

640
00:55:07,669 --> 00:55:10,137
- Put that stuff back!
- Actually, I need to borrow a few things.

641
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:12,570
Just stay away from the wall!

642
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:14,141
I'll cut your eyes out.

643
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:16,676
I need to find Roland.

644
00:55:16,778 --> 00:55:19,110
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

645
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:21,273
- I only got eight hours.
- Eight hours?

646
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:23,317
There's a girl-
Her flight lands in eight hours.

647
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:25,215
Think that stuff's gonna help?
That stuff's four years old.

648
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,084
Do you want me to jump you back to
high school so you can learn something?

649
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:31,090
I've been tracking him for 10 years.
Look at this. Look.

650
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:36,559
You see this?
Our first round in Nepal.

651
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:38,894
You should see the one he gave me
back in Prague.

652
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,764
Look. Forget it.
Forget Roland.

653
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,838
Don't waste your time.

654
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:45,997
Just leave it to me.

655
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,087
- Do you mind?
- Look.

656
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,281
Little, uh- Little privacy here?

657
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,790
You know, this is
kind of my thing. Just-

658
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:08,488
Just- Get-You know, turn around.

659
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:10,564
Yeah.

660
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:14,965
I'm- I was thinking
that if we do this together...

661
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,970
we could get him.

662
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:19,165
What? You mean, like, you and me?

663
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:21,799
- Yeah.
- Like we team up?

664
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,572
Yeah.

665
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:27,170
Look. I'm sorry,
but I don't play well with others.

666
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:46,590
Do me a favor, yeah?
Don't be here when I get back.

667
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:49,363
Find a rock. Crawl under it.
Stay there.

668
00:56:57,912 --> 00:57:00,437
Joi woo, brother.

669
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:03,016
That's "good-bye" in Chinese.

670
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:32,909
Yeah. No. I've been meaning to call. Really.
I still really want to get the tattoo.

671
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:10,684
You can't keep following me.

672
00:58:10,785 --> 00:58:13,515
Actually-
I'm the one person who can.

673
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,521
Yeah, lucky me.

674
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:31,101
Why are you walking?

675
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:34,505
I mean, I- I know Tokyo pretty well.
I got a lot of jump sites here.

676
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:39,376
You know, I-I- I like walking for
a change. Makes me feel normal.

677
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,608
You, uh-You ever read
Marvel Team-up?

678
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,617
Yeah, I read it. And?

679
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,418
Two superheroes joining forces
for, like, uh, a limited run.

680
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:52,493
I see what you're trying to do, yeah?
I'm not buying it.

681
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:55,995
For your own sake, just go home.

682
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,895
- You live in a cave.
- It's called a lair.

683
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,968
And what's the point?

684
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:05,165
I'm just saying, you know.
We, uh, kind of have this common thing.

685
00:59:07,508 --> 00:59:09,499
And I know where to find Roland.

686
00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:23,023
So we doing this, or what?

687
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:41,871
Whoo!

688
00:59:50,218 --> 00:59:52,243
Sorry. Clutch stuck.

689
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:57,080
- You're real subtle.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna get rid of you, am I?

690
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,135
Whoa. Whoa.

691
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:17,541
You might want to hold on, son.

692
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,122
That was close.

693
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,892
Not bad.

694
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,197
This thing must be two tons, easy.
How are you, uh-

695
01:00:42,303 --> 01:00:44,601
If it moves, I can jump it.

696
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:48,005
Actually, I knew this Jumper once-
crazy bastard-

697
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:50,373
tried to hop a whole building.

698
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,912
- Won't be trying that again.
- Why's that?

699
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:55,505
That's 'cause he's dead.
Killed him.

700
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:59,177
Still managed to shake it
a little though.

701
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,290
So how long you been doing this for?

702
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:08,055
- Doing what? Driving?
- No. Jumping.

703
01:01:08,162 --> 01:01:10,096
Since I was five.

704
01:01:10,198 --> 01:01:12,098
- Five?
- Yeah.

705
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,601
How'd you keep it a secret from people?

706
01:01:15,703 --> 01:01:19,070
- Like your parents.
- It's pretty easy when they're not around.

707
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:21,437
Where were they?

708
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:23,510
Not around.

709
01:01:27,915 --> 01:01:30,907
You know, my mom-
she took off when I was five.

710
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,750
I know what it's like
to not, you know-

711
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:37,290
My dad, he-

712
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:39,758
Did I ask about your family?

713
01:01:40,995 --> 01:01:43,987
I mean, are we on
Oprah here or-

716
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,672
Griffin, I can't keep doing this.
I gotta go.

717
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:58,541
Her flight lands any second.
I need an answer.

718
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:05,746
This is it, all right?
Marvel Team-up, now or never.

719
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:09,482
A very limited run, right?

720
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,582
Save her, kill him, you know.
We're done.

721
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:15,161
All right, Spidey.

722
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:18,964
Hey!

723
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:21,226
Due to increased security
measures, all bags-

724
01:02:21,335 --> 01:02:24,566
- Hey!
- Detroit International Airport asks you...

725
01:02:24,672 --> 01:02:26,697
to keep your bags in your
possession at all times.

726
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:31,211
Flight 427 to Cleveland
will now be boarding at Gate Number 5.

727
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:36,313
- Hey.
- The flight from Rome landed an hour ago.

728
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:38,385
Oh, no.

729
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,186
You didn't check on the flight?

730
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,657
All right. Well, we gotta find her,
you know.

731
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,786
You go find her. I'm gonna arm up.
Meet me back at the lair.

732
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:50,796
- All right?
- Fine.

733
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:56,302
What you looking at?

734
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:02,208
Boo!

735
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:11,217
Hey. Uh, I'm Millie's friend,
David. Is she here?

736
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:13,048
Last I checked she was with you.

737
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:16,652
Hey. Your friend came by.

738
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:22,123
- What are you talking about?
- Black guy, white hair. You just missed him.

739
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:59,626
- Jesus.
- Hey.

740
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:01,634
David, wh-

741
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:04,762
What the hell are you doing here?

742
01:04:04,872 --> 01:04:07,102
I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.

743
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:11,042
- So you just broke in? - Yeah. Well,
I needed to make sure that you were okay.

744
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:14,706
No, David. I'm not okay.
I got left in an airport in Rome.

745
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:19,353
I'm sorry.

746
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:23,723
You're sorry.

747
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:25,724
Thank you.

748
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:31,164
I think you should leave.

749
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:40,406
David, you need to leave!

750
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,375
Come on. Snap to it.
We don't have much time.

751
01:04:43,477 --> 01:04:45,741
- What? What are you doing?
- Uh-

752
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:48,747
- David, I told you to leave.
- Uh-

753
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:51,249
- Um-
- "Um" what?

754
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:55,550
- I'm not in banking, okay?
- No, really?

755
01:04:55,656 --> 01:04:58,284
- I mean, the money did come from a bank,
you know. - Yeah.

756
01:04:58,392 --> 01:05:03,329
- Uh, a few banks, actually. - Are-Are
you telling me you're a bank robber?

757
01:05:03,431 --> 01:05:05,399
Small part. Uh-

758
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:09,730
Will you please get out of my house?

759
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:19,811
Uh-huh.

760
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:23,312
Millie, I'm sorry.

761
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:25,851
Wh- Oh, my God. Okay.

762
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:28,421
- I'm really sorry, but we gotta go.
- Just go. Leave me alone.

763
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:30,820
Come on.

764
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:32,586
This might hurt a little bit, okay?

765
01:05:36,297 --> 01:05:38,993
- It's okay.
- Where am I?

766
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,830
Trust me, okay?

767
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:44,131
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Don't you even come near me.

768
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,263
- Millie.
- Don't even come near me.

769
01:05:49,977 --> 01:05:52,468
I'm gonna explain this, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything.

770
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,618
In here.

771
01:05:57,718 --> 01:06:00,653
Just, uh-Just stay where you are,
all right? Just stay right there.

772
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:03,349
- David?
- Hurry up. It's closing.

773
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:26,173
Griffin.

774
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,305
There's something I gotta tell ya.

775
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,714
- Did you find her? - There's something
that's gonna piss you off.

776
01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:33,252
- Piss me off?
- David.

777
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:35,413
What is this?

778
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:37,252
- David?
- What's she doing here?

779
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:39,849
- This isn't some kind of clubhouse,
you know. - What is going on?

780
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,552
- Stay inside.
- Wanna see the top of Everest?

781
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:43,755
- I was trying to tell you.
- Maybe the bottom?

782
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:45,923
- What?
- Griffin, listen to me.

783
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,933
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

784
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:50,333
By bringing her down here, they can
follow you. They have a machine.

785
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:53,168
- It can open wormholes and keep them open.
- What are you talking about?

786
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:54,866
I'm saying they can
follow us anywhere.

787
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,000
And you brought her here.

788
01:07:11,225 --> 01:07:13,455
- Shit.
- There's two of you?

789
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,461
David, what is going on?

790
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:18,054
Millie- Millie, stay right here.

791
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:20,065
No. No!

792
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:23,469
- What have you done?
- Griffin-

793
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:25,562
- Where does this thing go?
- We gotta go.

794
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:27,470
David, what did you do?

795
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,118
Holy shit.

796
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,636
Mom?

797
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:49,381
Thanks for leading me to your friend.

798
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:53,358
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you
doing this to me? I never hurt you.

799
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,360
I never hurt anybody.

800
01:08:56,597 --> 01:08:58,565
Not yet, but you will.

801
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:03,634
Sooner or later, you all go bad.

802
01:09:03,737 --> 01:09:04,999
What if I'm different?

803
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:11,672
- You're not different.
- I'm different.

804
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:13,474
- Boo.
- Move!

805
01:09:30,664 --> 01:09:33,565
It's time to send you home to mommy.

806
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:03,856
David?

807
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,228
Millie.

808
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:30,449
David?

809
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:34,958
Millie, get out of here.
Run, okay?

810
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:36,427
Millie. Millie, run!

811
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:14,526
I'm gonna get you down
so you can get me out of here.

812
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:16,102
Great.

813
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:19,837
Geez.

814
01:11:26,447 --> 01:11:28,745
Can you take me now, please?

815
01:11:41,395 --> 01:11:44,455
Okay.
I'll take you.

816
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,931
I'll leave you alone.

817
01:11:52,506 --> 01:11:54,633
It was always you though.

818
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,569
Ever since we were five.

819
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,815
It was always you.

820
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:04,985
Please just take me.

821
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:10,849
Take a deep breath.

822
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,435
I got it.
I trapped them there.

823
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:25,437
Without the machine,
they're screwed.

824
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:30,070
No. Millie.

825
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:32,737
- Got her!
- No!

826
01:12:32,846 --> 01:12:34,336
Millie.

827
01:12:34,448 --> 01:12:37,042
Buddy. Wow.

828
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:42,619
Crap. I, uh- I didn't expect that.
I- I didn't know.

829
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:48,959
Now they have to come to us.

830
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:51,031
Let's get these fires out.

831
01:12:54,902 --> 01:12:57,530
What's that?

832
01:12:57,638 --> 01:13:00,436
- Huh? What?
- What are you doing?

833
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,203
Nothing. I was, uh,
thinking about going bowling.

834
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,710
- What?
- Roland's in there with his whole army.

835
01:13:05,813 --> 01:13:08,213
I'm gonna go back there and end this.
What do you think?

836
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:10,783
- I'm gonna blow 'em to Timbuktu-
- Yeah, but Millie's in there.

837
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,852
Well, yeah, there is that as well.

838
01:13:12,953 --> 01:13:15,478
- I gotta go- I gotta go get her.
- Huh?

839
01:13:15,589 --> 01:13:18,558
Griffin, it's my fault that she's there.
All right? You-

840
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,217
- You can't just-
- What?

841
01:13:20,327 --> 01:13:22,522
We gotta get her out.
We have to get her out.

842
01:13:22,629 --> 01:13:25,393
I can hear you! I'm not deaf.
I understand what you're saying.

843
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:27,967
- All right. Well-
- It's a crying shame. It really is.

844
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:31,299
But you know what? We all have to
make sacrifices once in a while. You know.

845
01:13:32,773 --> 01:13:35,674
Where's the detonator?

846
01:13:35,776 --> 01:13:37,505
I don't see you making any.

847
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:40,079
You know what?
I made mine.

848
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,080
All right?

849
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:44,082
When I was five.

850
01:13:44,184 --> 01:13:46,812
Came to my house
and killed my parents.

851
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:57,690
David, David.

852
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:13,346
Yeah?

853
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:21,613
Look. Before this gets out of hand,
let's just talk about this.

854
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:29,995
How about this for talking, huh?
Am I getting the message through to you?

855
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:31,997
I can't let you do this.

856
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:35,865
Look, David. You touch the safe again,
and I'm gonna kill you. Have you got it?

857
01:14:45,078 --> 01:14:47,740
Give me the detonator, David!

858
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:51,545
- Give it back!
- Sorry, Griffin!

859
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:55,482
Give it back!

860
01:14:57,324 --> 01:15:00,020
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

861
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:03,096
Don't.

862
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,031
Bad move.

863
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:30,255
Hey!

864
01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh, shit.

865
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:03,284
God, I hate Chechnya.

866
01:16:05,425 --> 01:16:07,393
Where'd you go?

867
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,566
Well, then, brother,
I guess our limited run's done.

868
01:16:44,064 --> 01:16:46,692
The old electricity trick.
That's a nice move.

869
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,930
- Thanks. - Cut me down, and,
uh, we can finish this, yeah?

870
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:54,201
You know, it didn't have to be this way.

871
01:16:54,308 --> 01:16:57,004
There's five of them back there.
You go back there alone, you're dead.

872
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,670
You hear me?
You can't win!

873
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:03,443
Get me down, David!
You do this alone, and you're dead.

874
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,518
You're not a hero, David!

875
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:09,612
You're a Jumper!
You don't save the girl!

876
01:17:09,723 --> 01:17:11,657
Don't you get it?

877
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:13,292
Whoa.

878
01:17:13,393 --> 01:17:15,861
Out of the way!

879
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:27,705
- Move!
- Watch it!

880
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,139
Got him!

881
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,239
No!

882
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,349
Shit.

883
01:17:47,794 --> 01:17:51,321
There's some things you can't jump, David.

884
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:05,842
Only God should have this power.

885
01:18:05,946 --> 01:18:08,107
Not you, David.

886
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:12,174
David, I'm so sorry
about what I said before.

887
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:20,750
Take a deep breath.

888
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:27,651
David. Hey. Hey.

889
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:31,629
David? Hey. Hey.

890
01:19:31,731 --> 01:19:33,961
David!

891
01:19:34,067 --> 01:19:36,535
- Ooh.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

892
01:19:36,636 --> 01:19:38,604
- Oh, you-
- I'm sorry.

893
01:19:38,705 --> 01:19:41,333
What's my dishwasher doing in the library?

894
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:45,242
Oh.

895
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:49,612
David!

896
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:54,352
- I'm impressed.
- Stay here, okay?

897
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:55,682
What?

898
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:58,724
You've come a long way
from robbing banks.

899
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:09,902
I told you I'm different.

900
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:16,366
I could have dropped you
with the sharks.

901
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:11,193
Hi.

902
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:14,062
Can I help you?

903
01:21:15,168 --> 01:21:17,136
Is-Is Mary here?

904
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:21,732
Hey, Mom.

905
01:21:29,549 --> 01:21:31,983
Honey, why don't you wait upstairs?

906
01:21:32,085 --> 01:21:34,053
Okay.

907
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:38,347
You know, it wasn't
easy finding you.

908
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,426
You shouldn't be here.

909
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,825
So it's true.

910
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,732
You're one of them.

911
01:21:50,837 --> 01:21:52,395
Yes, it's true.

912
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:56,502
You were five years old
your first jump.

913
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,578
I only had two choices.

914
01:21:58,678 --> 01:22:01,306
Kill you, or leave you.

915
01:22:01,414 --> 01:22:03,348
So you left.

916
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:07,911
- To protect you.
- I was five.

917
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:14,120
I did what I had to do.

918
01:22:14,227 --> 01:22:17,196
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Not even for one day.

919
01:22:25,472 --> 01:22:28,703
So I'm a Jumper.
You're a Paladin.

920
01:22:28,808 --> 01:22:30,776
That's right.

921
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:35,774
What now?

922
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:39,378
I'm giving you a head start, Son...

923
01:22:40,587 --> 01:22:42,851
because I love you.

924
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:51,130
Good luck.

925
01:23:21,695 --> 01:23:23,663
Hey.

926
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:31,131
- You okay?
- Yeah.

927
01:23:33,006 --> 01:23:35,304
You sure?

928
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:37,376
Yeah. I am.

929
01:23:39,612 --> 01:23:41,512
Good.

930
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:44,845
'Cause I'm freezing.
Can we please go someplace warm?

931
01:23:45,952 --> 01:23:48,853
- Where do you want to go?
- Surprise me.
