Subrip: Krzysiek  - jarzyna
In the morning
when I wake up and listen to the sound
Of the birds outside on the roof
I try to ignore what the paper says
And I try not to read all the news
And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
And I hope it never comes true
'Cause you and I been through|so many things together
And the sun starts climbing the roof
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
Only a dream
Just a memory
without anywhere
You come here to make a record,|and you got great musicians...
you know, and I always gather|my own friends around...
that I pick, you know, to play.
I don't really go|for the studio musician guys that much.
You know, I don't come in and say,|"Get me this," and "Get me that."
But I have my own band.
And I like to play on the road|with the same band I use in the studio.
I've been working with Neil for 35...|Since '70.
And we cut "Harvest" here in Nashville.|He was doing "The Johnny Cash Show..."
and he showed up at that studio,|Quadrafonic...
down on Grand Avenue, I think.
And he wanted to do some music...
that he'd written recently,|and this was in the '70s.
And he stopped...
One of the engineers|stopped a bass player...
who was walking down the street...
and said, "You wanna come in|and do some music with Neil Young?"
And he said, "Sure." So he came in.
It was Tim Drummond,|was the bass player's name.
And they asked him|if Neil wanted a steel guitar player...
and I lived about two blocks|down the street.
And so he called me up,|and I came down...
and they were|already recording at the time...
and I set up my steel|and kind of snuck in there...
and started playing.
And we did five songs before we ever|stopped and introduced ourselves.
My family used to drive up|from Birmingham, Alabama area.
And we would go...
Try to make it up|at least once a month...
but a lot of times we made it up|twice a month...
to come to the Ryman|to see the Grand Ole Opry...
and have "breakfast with the stars" as|they said down on Broadway back then.
It was a little radio show that...
the people that was gonna go|to the Ryman that night...
could go down and eat breakfast|with all the people...
that were sober enough|the next morning...
to have breakfast.
I've performed at the Ryman one time...
with my songwriting friend Dan Penn.
And we were invited to play with...
They called it the Legendary|Songwriter's Series or something...
and that was a lot of fun, you know.
And that place has great acoustics,|I think.
You know, it's just...
You can crank it out|without trying too hard.
A lot of, you know, the volume carries|real well there, seem like.
The Ryman Auditorium,|there's such a vibe in there.
There's this sound in there|that is unlike any other place.
And that's really nice|because some places...
you come,|and they sound like a big tin can.
And there is something about it.
Obviously,|there's a lot of stories in this building.
And I'm sure glad|they didn't tear it down.
They were apparently|gonna tear it down.
But now they're building a high rise...
on the side where those beautiful|stained glass windows are.
It's gonna block out the light.
And I don't know how anybody could...
That should be illegal.
You know, like, the artistic police|or the aesthetic police should...
if there was such a thing,|should come and arrest them.
On this last project, I mean,|he made a statement to me...
and I didn't believe it.
He said, "It's been two years|since I've wrote something, right?"
And when he got to the hotel|around his old buddies again...
you couldn't get him from writing.
You couldn't stop him from writing,|you know.
That's just how it comes.
- I had no idea that there was.|- But there was a little, to be honest...
there was a little bit of, kind of...
We just picked up on a little bit of, like...
something's going on.|We don't know what's going on, exactly.
When he made this record, it was right|after he found out he had the aneurysm.
And I think of it as like,|his life flashing before his eyes.
And just remembering all these things,|and wanting to say these things.
'Cause, you know, you don't...
We didn't really know|what was gonna happen.
He said, "I got this brain aneurysm."
And, I mean, the world stopped.|To me, it was just like, "You what?"
And he said, "Yeah.|I've got this brain aneurysm...
"and I'm gonna go to New York|next Tuesday...
"and they're gonna...|You know, they're gonna do this thing."
He goes, "And it's really wild,|what they're gonna do."
I said, "Well, what are they gonna do?"
He said,|"Well, they're gonna go in there...
"and they're gonna put|these little bitty springs in there...
"and they're biodegradable.|And what that does is, that makes...
"the body produce the scar tissue,|which then negates the aneurysm."
I'm sitting there going, "What?"|You know.
And,|"Why are you sitting here right now?
"How is that?" You know.
"How can it be|that you're going there next Tuesday...
"and we're sitting here recording?"
I'm just going, "What's..."
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
We don't use a tenor saxophone,|we use two baritone parts instead...
so that the part of the tenor|has a lot of bite to it.
Trying to remember what Daddy said
B45. "Heart of Gold,"|written and recorded. "Old Man..."
Check. One, two.
You wanna come out?
Check. One, two. Check. One, two.
Check. One, two. Check. One, two.
All right.|Just keep this with you all night.
Every time you come outside|you need it to get back in. Thanks.
I just wanna play well and I wanna...
you know,|share the stage with my friends...
give the best I can.
We're gonna get in there|and let the muse have us.
Take a shot.
Send it out.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,|and welcome to the Ryman.
And the world premiere|"of Neil Young's" Prairie Wind.
The painter stood
Before her work
She looked around everywhere
She saw the pictures|and she painted them
Picking colors from the air
Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow|In the light
Black to black|When the evening comes
Blue to blue|Through the night
It's a long road
Behind me
It's a long road
Ahead
If you follow every dream
You might get lost
If you follow every dream
You might
Get
Lost
She toed the line
She held her end up
She did the work of two men
But in the end|She fell down
Before she got up again
I have my friends eternally
We leave our tracks in the sound
Some of them are with me now
Some of them can't be found
It's a long road
Behind me
And I miss you now
If you follow every dream
You might get lost
If you follow every dream
You might
Get
Lost
Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow|In the light
Black to black|When the evening comes
Blue to blue|Through the night
See the bluebird fly
easy as a dream
Dipping and bobbing in the sun
Could she be the one
I saw so long ago
Could she be the one to take me home
This pasture is green
I'm walking in the sun
It's turning brown|I'm standing in the rain
My overcoat is worn
The pockets are all torn
I'm moving away from the pain
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
The old church bell
The bride and her love
Seeking guidance from above
Amber waves of grain|bow in the prairie wind
I'm hearing Willie singing|on the radio again
That song from 9/11|keeps ringing in my head
I'll always remember|something Chris Rock said
Don't send no more candles
No matter what you do
Then Willie stopped singing
And the prairie wind blew
The green kept rolling on|For miles and miles
Fields of fuel rolling on for miles
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Toll, toll
The fallen soldier bell
The old church on the hill
Still standing when so many fell
Back when I was young|the birds blocked out the sun
Before the great migration south
We only shot a few|They last the winter through
Mother cooked them good|and served them up
Somewhere a senator|sits in a leather chair
Behind a big wooden desk
The caribou we kill|mean nothing to him
He took his money just like all the rest
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
Ring the wedding bells
The bride takes the ring
And the happy people sing
I just want to thank you
For all of the things you've done
I've been thinking about you
I just want to send my love
I send my best to you
That's my message of love
For all the things you did|I never thank you enough
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
I just want to tell you
You sure mean a lot to me
It may sound simple
But you are the world to me
It's such a precious thing
The time we shared together
I must apologize
For the troubled times
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Falling off the face of the Earth
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the Earth
This is a song here...
When I first started playing guitar...
I was a chicken farmer at the time...
I was about seven|or eight years old or something and...
Maybe a little older than that.
But my daddy brought me|an Arthur Godfrey ukulele...
a little plastic one.
And, now, I didn't know|what to do with it or anything...
but he said, "You might need this."
And then he sang me a song...
which I never heard him sing before,|or anything.
And then he got this funny grin|on his face and he was looking at me.
And I was watching him.
Then I had to go feed the chickens.
One, two, three...
When I was a growing boy
Rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
Bury me on the Ione prairie
Uncle Bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese|once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Yeah, bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home
Out on the Trans-Canada Highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way|to Nashville, Tennessee
When another car passed me by
Some day I'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down|to the Promised Land
And then I'm gonna really go far
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese|once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Just bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home
You know,|to look around Nashville today...
there's a lot more cars,|there's a lot more new buildings.
I often wonder what Hank Williams|would have thought...
if he stepped out of that stage door...
on his way to Tootsie's, and looked up...
and saw the Gaylord|Entertainment Center sitting there.
So things have changed, I think.|But the spirit's still here...
and that's a beautiful thing.
In the morning
when I wake up and listen to the sound
Of the birds outside on the roof
I try to ignore what the paper says
And I try not to read all the news
And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
And I hope that it never comes true
'Cause you and I been through|so many things together
And the sun starts climbing the roof
It's a dream
It's only a dream
Just a memory
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
without anywhere
to stay
Red River still flows|through my hometown
Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
Swirling around the old bridge pylons
Where a boy fishes the morning away
A bicycle leans on an oak tree
While the cars rumble over his head
An airplane leaves a trail|in an empty blue sky
And the young birds call out to be fed
It's a dream
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
without anywhere
to stay
An old man walks along on the sidewalk
With sunglasses and an old Stetson hat
The four winds blow the back|of his overcoat away
As he stops with a policeman to chat
And a train rolls out of the station
That was really something in its day
Picking up speed
on the straight prairie rails
As it carries its passengers away
It's gone
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
without anywhere
to stay
It's a dream
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
without anywhere
to stay
It's a dream
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
Thank you, Nashville.
Well, it sure is great to be here tonight|with all of you.
You know, getting to be|about that time, some of us are...
starting to lose our parents and stuff.
My daddy passed away|a couple of months ago...
and in the last part of his life,|he had dementia.
And that's...
I know some of you know|what that's like...
and it's something else to see|your loved ones living in the moment.
But...
when he passed,|we had a nice service for him...
and my little cousin, or niece...
she was about this high, and|she came up to me, said, you know:
"Daddy was okay.|He knew what was going on.
"Once a police car pulled up|behind him...
"right behind him,|there was this police car...
"and he said, 'Cop.'
"So I know he was okay."
Trying to remember what my daddy said
Before too much time|took away his head
He said we're gonna go back|and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Back to Cypress River|back to the old farmhouse
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Well, I tried to tell the people|but they never heard a word I said
They say there's nothing out there|but wheat fields anyway
Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry|in her back yard
Out on the prairie|where the wind blows long and hard
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Late at night|lights dancing in the northern sky
Just the Indian spirits|trying to show me how to fly
You can see into the future|but it may be a mirage
Like a new car sitting there|in your old garage
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Well, there's a place on the prairie|where evil and goodness play
Daddy told me all about it|but I don't remember what he said
Well, it may be afternoon
and it may be the dead of night
But you'll know when you see it|'cause it sure is a hell of a sight
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what my daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Before too much time|took away his head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
So we're gonna go back|and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Going back to Cypress River|back to the old farmhouse
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Thank you.
You know, I got a beautiful young girl.
She's just turned 21.
She's going back|for her last year of college pretty soon.
She'd probably be embarrassed|if I said anything more about her.
You know how that is? Can't say much.
Anyway, there was a time|I used to write these kind of songs...
for girls my own age.
- You still got a few good years.|- Yeah. I got a few left in me.
So this is what you might call|kind of an empty-nester song.
It's a new genre...
and they might even have|a new kind of radio station for them.
When your summer days|come tumbling down
And you find yourself alone
You can come back
and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart
beating for you
Yes, I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
When the winter comes|to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
You can come back
and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart
beating for you
Yes, I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
In the spring|protective arms surrounded you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness I know will always find you
And when it does, I hope that it will stay
Yes, I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
Yes, I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
I'll always be
here for you
Thank you.
You know...
one of my favorite guitars in the world|is Willie Nelson's guitar...
and the way it looks.
And this guitar here...
my friend Grant, Grant Boatwright...
found this guitar for me|about 30 years ago...
and I bought it from Tuck Taylor.
And this is Hank's old guitar.
It was here in 1951, I think,|and that was Hank's last show here.
Maybe, I think it was...
Maybe he got back.|He got fired, I know that.
But maybe he came back|one more time, I'm not sure but...
don't think so.|So I'm glad to see it back here...
and I'm glad...
Anyway, here's a tune for you.
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
I'm taking care of it now
It's been around for years and years
Just waiting in its old case
It's been up and down the country roads
It brought a tear and a smile
It's had its share of dreams and hopes
It never went out of style
The more I play it, the better it sounds
It cries when I leave it alone
Silently it waits for me
Or someone else I suppose
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar has caught some breaks
But it never searched for gold
It can't be blamed for my mistakes
It only does what it's told
It's been a messenger|in times of trouble
In times of hope and fear
When I get drunk and seeing double
It jumps behind the wheel and steers
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's mine to play for a while
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's only mine for a while
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
Was he thinkin' about my country
Or the color of my skin?
Was he thinkin' about my religion
And the way I worshipped him?
Did he create just me in his image
Or every living thing?
When God made me
When God made me
Was he planning only for believers
Or for those who just have faith?
Did he envision all the wars
That were fought in his name?
Did he think there was only one way
To be close to him?
When God made me
When God made me
Did he give us the gift of love
To say who we could choose?
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
Did he give me the gift of voice
So some could silence me?
Did he give me the gift of vision
Not knowing what I might see?
Did he give us the gift of compassion
To help our fellow man?
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
I am a child
I'll last a while
You can't conceive
of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand
rough up my hair
It's lots of fun|to have you there
I gave to you|now you give to me
I'd like to know|what you've learned
The sky is blue|and so is the sea
What is the color
when black is burned?
What is the color?
You are a man
you understand
You pick me up
then you lay me down again
You make the rules
you say what's fair
It's lots of fun|to have you there
I gave to you|now you give to me
I'd like to know|what you've learned
The sky is blue|and so is the sea
What is the color
when black is burned?
What is the color?
Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's gettin' late
And the moon is climbin' high
I want to celebrate
See it shinin' in your eye
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Harvest moon
I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner|for a heart of gold
It's these expressions|I never give
That keep me searching|for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching|for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood
I went to Redwood
I crossed the ocean|for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
it's such a fine line
Keeps me searching|for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching|for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching|for a heart of gold
Keep me searching|and I'm growing old
Keep me searching|for a heart of gold
I've been a miner|for a heart of gold
Thank you.
About that time when I wrote that song|and I was touring...
I had also...
just, you know,|being a rich hippie for the first time...
had purchased a ranch.
And...
I still live there today.
And there was a couple living on it...
that were the caretakers and...
Old gentleman named Louis Avela...
and his wife, Clara.
And there was this old blue jeep there.
And Louis took me for a...
took me for a ride...
in this blue jeep.
And he gets me up there|on the top side of the place...
and there's this lake up there|that fed all the pastures...
and he says, "Well, tell me,|how does a young man like yourself...
"have enough money|to buy a place like this?"
And I said, "Well, I'm just lucky, Louis.|Just real lucky."
He said, "Well,|that's the darnedest thing I ever heard."
And then I wrote this song for him.
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four|and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things|that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
and you can tell that's true
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around in the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
and you can tell that's true
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
I caught you knockin'|at my cellar door
I love you, baby|can I have some more
Oh, the damage done
I hit the city|and I lost my band
I watched the needle|take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done
I sing the song|because I love the man
I know that some|of you don't understand
Milk-blood
to keep from running out
I've seen the needle|and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's|like a settin' sun
King went a-runnin' after deer
Wasn't scared of jumpin'|off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffin'|and he would go
Was the best old hound dog|I ever did know
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
"There in my truck, the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about|the times we had
Once when I kicked him|when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went a-howlin' after deer
Wasn't scared of jumpin'|off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffin'|and he would go
Was the best old hound dog|I ever did know
That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog|that was half as fine
I may find one, you never do know
'Cause I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went a-howlin' after deer
Wasn't scared of jumpin'|off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffin'|and he would go
Was the best old hound dog|I ever did know
Is there a guitar player in the house?
This song here,|I recorded here in Nashville...
and Nicolette Larson|sang this song with me.
I'd really like to do this one for her.
Comes a time
when you're driftin'
Comes a time|when you settle down
Comes a light
feelin's lifting
Lift that baby|right up off the ground
Oh, this old world
keeps spinning round
It's a wonder tall trees
ain't layin' down
There comes a time
"You and I
we were captured
We took our souls|and we flew away
We were right|we were giving
That's how we kept|what we gave away
Oh, this old world
keeps spinnin' round
It's a wonder tall trees
ain't layin' down
There comes a time
Oh, this old world
keeps spinnin' round
It's a wonder tall trees
ain't laying down
There comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Thank you.
This song here was written|by lan Tyson.
He's a Canadian.
He's living out in Calgary,|on his ranch, right now...
But when I was just a kid,|16 years or 17 years old...
I went to this place near Winnipeg|where I grew up...
and it's called Falcon Lake.
And it's just one of those first times...
when you really got away from home|and were on your own.
I was just kind of feeling it|for the first time.
And there was this little...
kind of a restaurant place|with a jukebox in it that was there...
and I used to go there.
And I think I spent all my money...
playing this next song|over and over again.
It was the most beautiful record|that I've ever heard in my life...
and I just could not get enough of it.
And so, I don't have the record|with me here...
but I'm gonna sing it with my friends,|and we'll see what we can do.
Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go
to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that|a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow Ionely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change
Come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
You could meet me
if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold
way out there
Four strong winds that blow Ionely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change
Come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that|a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow Ionely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change
Come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
One of these days
I'm gonna sit down|and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm gonna try
To thank them all|for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown
One of these days
I'm gonna sit down|and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
- "And it won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
- "Won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
And I'm gonna thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who played that rock 'n' roll
Well, I never tried
to burn any bridges
But I know I let
some good things go
One of these days
I'm gonna sit down|and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
- "And it won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
- "Won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
From down in LA
All the way to Nashville
From New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak
some are strong
One of these days
I'm gonna sit down|and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
- "And it won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
- "Won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
- "And it won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
- "Won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
- "And it won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
- "Won't be long"|- "Won't be long"
Don't call pretty Peggy
she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message
'round her back door
They say the old laughing lady
been here before
She don't keep time
She don't count score
Well, you can't have a cupboard
if there ain't no wall
You got to move
there's no time for you to stall
They say the old laughing lady
dropped by to call
When she leaves
she leaves nothing at all
See the drunkard of the village
falling on the street
Can't tell his ankle
from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady
'cause her taste is so sweet
But the laughing lady's loving
ain't the kind he can keep
There's a fever on the freeway
blacks out the night
There's a slipping on the stairway
just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling|in the bedroom
a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady
everything is all right
It's the old laughing lady
everything is all right
There's the old laughing lady
