My pops used to always say,|''Dreaming is the luxury of children ''...
...and that I should enjoy it.
He was right.
Here it is, the last year of high school|for me and my friends...
...and this is all I can|ever really see myself doing.
When you got responsibilities,|you ain't got time to dream.
I guess it's the difference between|being a boy and a man.
And down South...
...you grow up quick.
Especially in the A TL.
This here is my 'hood.
Mechanicsville.
752 Mandeville Lane.
Middle of the city, center of our universe.
Wake up, A TL, it's 6:23.|It's your boy, Frank Ski in the morning.
And we've got another scorcher planned|for you here in the Dirty South.
I'm talking Dirty South hot|A TL weather today.
I tell you what, another heat index,|another record-breaking day.
''What is your ethnic background?''
I am a brother.
Uncle George,|my mama's brother.
He supposed to be raising us...
...but responsibility was not really|his strong point.
''Bisex-- HeterosexuaI.''
Don't get it twisted, baby.
Hey, Ant. You want a ride, homeboy,|you better act Iike it.
-That's my little brother, Ant.|-AII right.
I call him ''Jellybean. ''
Hardheaded on the outside,|soft on the inside.
And that's me, Rashad.
Heir to the family business,|Swann Cleaning Service...
...and man of the house.
''How wouId you describe your physique?
Trim, muscuIar, pIeasantIy pIump.''
-What?|-Hey, Iet us get a box of cereaI, man.
We ran out.
Man, they aIways eating.
MuscuIar.
I know how much is in there too.
One bowI each.
Yeah.
My boy, Esquire.
He's basically my best friend.|He got accepted to an Ivy League school.
There goes four.
Check out this brother, just grinning,|jogging through campus with a white girI.
ProbabIy running from that crowd of|white boys on the opposite page.
Either way you Iook at it, man, you Iucky.
Yeah, man. It ain't paid for yet.
I'm gonna need grants, Ioans,|a job and a dream to pay this tuition off.
''Ex-bIackIy.''
We had to drive across town|because E went to Mount Paran.
My boy book smart...
...maybe even borderline brilliant|to these kids...
...but he's just plain old Esquire to us.
Why you aIways be driving in our car?
-Get out the car.|-Look, boy.
With your stupid IittIe outfit, man.
Rashad, I'm gonna hurt him.
Man, get out of here.
-Peace.|-You mean ''War,'' brother.
War!
-How you doing, Mr. Sapp?|-Hey, Ben.
-Have a seat.|-Right.
I got the information you wanted|regarding the FaIcon Society.
Let's have a Iook.
GPA is over 4.0.
Test scores are high.
Essay's strong.
AII you need is a good Ietter|of recommendation.
You're in great shape.
I was wondering if|you couId write that for me.
I'm fIattered, Ben, I am,|but I'm not reaIIy the right person.
I'm sure your parents know a judge,|a businessman?
I don't think my parents|know anybody Iike that, sir.
Sometimes it's not what you know...
...but who you know.
Our school was a little different.
See, we in the Trey, Mechanicsville High.
Alma mater to some of|the greatest players in the city.
That's my boy Teddy right there.
He A TL for real.
Never been outside of 285.
Hey, what you doing here, man?|You must have Iost your job.
Had to get my breakfast on.|Brother gotta eat.
Get it how you Iive, pimp.
-Brooklyn, from New y ork.|-No means no, man.
And reminds us of it every chance he get.

Seniors, it's almost graduation.
If you haven't done it yet,|get your cap and gowns ordered.
We were five weeks from graduation.|I had all my credits.
And all I had to do was cruise for|the next month and I'd be straight.
Please give them|a Tiger round of applause.
And one more thing.
We have a lot of sports|going on this week.
And we want to thank the people...
-...who were involved this weekend.|-Everybody in a seat.
Year's aImost over. Thank you, Jesus.
Y'aII sIackers better figure out|what to do for the summer.
My little brother wasn't exactly|a troublemaker.
-That ain't right.|-But he ran his mouth too much.
-Why ain't it?|-And he was definitely hardheaded.
I know what I'II be doing this summer.
I'm gonna be getting paid.
Ms. Jackson...
...can you pIease cut on the a.c.?
Man, it feeI Iike a sIave ship in here.
Air conditioning is for honors cIasses.
Kids who wanna make something|out of themseIves.
Was you in honors cIasses?
Because you ain't got no a.c. either.
See what I'm saying?
He stayed in trouble.
But I couldn't wait on him|to get out of detention.
We had to scoop Teddy.
How your sister doing, man?
I been caIIing her,|and she ain't been caIIing me back.
She trying to pIay me?|She seeing somebody eIse?
Come on, man, keep it reaI with me.

Now open wide, wide, wide.
Bite down on that. CooI, cooI.
Hey, man. Ready?
Oh, heII, yeah. I'm gone.
Hey, man, peace.
After we pick up Teddy, we shoot on|over to the Shady Grove Country Club.
That's where Esquire works.
We expected him to be late...
...because he was always out there on|the golf course, hustling the rich kids.
Yes, yes, and yes.
Oh, my God, I Iove poetry.
I write in my diary every day.
Oh, reaIIy?|Let me kick something for you.
She sits there|Pain filling the back of her eyes
Forcing them to leak
So aII I need to do is|I need to get your digits.
Your daddy ain't around, is he?
Even though her tolerance|Has reached its peak
Now, Iook here, when you caII me,|don't even trip, okay?
If a Iady answer the phone,|that's my mama.
She staying with me|because she going through some things.
She's so soft
She could have been|The spokesperson for cotton
You know, that's just IittIe things|that I Iike do to...
...because I Iike to throw stuff in the air.
These guys don't know anything|about poetry.
They're not reaIIy cuItured.
-Hey, what's up, Esquire, man?|-Man....

-Can't you see I'm over here--|-You reciting poetry and shit.

It's Iike the fIies--|Why are there so many fIies out here?
-Man, I know you not gonna get into this.|-For reaI.
Okay, so why is there a rat on|every corner in New York City?
Why, after every sentence,|you caII me ''shorty''?
''Yo, shorty, shorty.'' I'm taIIer than you.
Let me ask you this, then.
In New York City, why y'aII say,|''Yo, son,'' after every sentence?
-I'm not your kid. I'm not your chiId.|-Right.
Why I gotta be your son?

So why you just wave at her?
Shut up, man.

We were all at the same place|in our lives...
...trying to figure out what's next.
The one thing I did know:|These were my friends.

And Sunday night, we got loose.
-That's right.|-Let's go and do the damn thing, man.

Oh, yeah, y'aII, here we go again.|Cascade's on a Sunday night.

It's time we had a brother-to-brother talk.
Or to put it delicately,|a talk about the birds and the bees.
At 1 3, girls are just like comic books...
...loaded with adventure,|easy to understand...
...and don't cost more|than a quarter to take out.
In this house, we never|discussed our problems.
We just watched Good Times.|It seemed like the answer to everything.
When you get a little older, I'll teach you|how to handle yourself in the NFL of love.
My pops always told me|to take care of my little brother.
I hope I got through to him.
Here we go. It's gonna be|a Iong night for some of y'aII.

You were supposed to be over at HoIIy's|house getting some rest before practice.
Baby, you been Iying...
...about where you been going|and who you been with.
What if something happened to you?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Why can't I pick my friends|and choose things in Iife for myseIf?
Because you're not making|very good choices, baby.
I mean, you got a Iot of|good opportunities to choose from.
Like what? Going to Brinton?
Oh, baby.
SpeIman is a great schooI,|but your father and I just--
-But what?|-WeII, we're saying...
...Iook at some other choices,|some other options.

You know how Iucky you are?
Yes, Daddy.|I do know that I am very fortunate.
Thank you for being a great parent.
But I knew if I were to ask to go over there,|you wouId've had a heart attack!
You damn right! You know why?|Because I was that guy.
I know what he wanted from you.
And it wasn't them big-ass earrings.
Why do you aIways think somebody|aIways wants something?
I work too hard.|I don't wanna see you go down--
I don't have to expIain myseIf.
Why? If you don't have to expIain,|I don't have to expIain.
Because I said so!
You better go to bed now.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let's just caIm down...

There's nothing more to taIk about.
End of conversation.
Yo, man, you aII right?

No, I made the mistake.
Not being honest with you before.
What about?
I Iive five bIocks away from Cascade's|on the south side.
-You said you went to Mount Paran.|-I do.
I use the cIub address|to go to schooI in a better district.
So you're just a Iiar?
My parents can't afford|to send me to private schooI, sir.
So you knew Erin before you met me?
Yes, I knew Erin.
-But I didn't know you was her father.|-You expect me to beIieve that?
-I got your game, Ben.|-My game?
I don't pIay games, Mr. Garnett.
That's one thing I do not do|is pIay games.
I'm too busy trying to make it out.
I figured you knew that,|coming up on the south side.
As far as the Ietter, I just thought the Ietter|wouId give me a better shot, that's aII.
We'II never know now, wiII we?|You can Iet yourseIf out.
You know, I read in this articIe...
...where you said being a CEO|didn't make you a proud man...
...being a proud man made you a CEO.
But a proud man doesn't hide|where he comes from.
Be carefuI.
See, with or without that Ietter,|I'm gonna make it.
And I won't forget MechanicsviIIe, Georgia,|made me who I am.
With aII due respect, sir,|it made you who you are.
Might heIp your daughter|to know that too.
Come on.
HoIIer at your boy, man.
I made them come...
...so you wouIdn't kick my ass.
Man, come on, dog. Damn.
Man, we friends, man.|We boys. Hear him out.
I just wanted to say sorry.

You don't get it, do you?
I'm his daddy now.
Get out the way.
Pleasure turns to the pain
Of the lessons learned from the strain|Of the questions burned in my brain
About whether love is humane|In its touch.
These thoughts are like salmon
Swimming upstream|In the tears of your deceit
Fighting the current hurt|That kills more than is created
By the chaos of our intertwined emotions
Chaotic because the anchor|Of Eros' arrow
Has been plucked from the vessel|Of my undying infatuation
Separation not as simple|As the distance between us
My mind no longer possessed|By the demons
That had been the overseers|Of my enslavement to your lies
The seeds of these lies|Rooted so deeply
They have cracked the foundation|Of what we once shared
Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside|To gush out like a river
Ripping the image of our future together|From my thoughts
As violently and as brutally|As if it were a child being taken
From his mother's arms
I'm left surrounded in darkness
But I refuse to be swallowed by it
My loneliness like the night air.|Invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch
In its cold uncomfortableness
y et if I could do it all over again
I'd do it in the same skin I'm in
To lay down and let love die
Just stay down and let love lie
No, no, not I
I'll stay 'round and let love fly
Even though I have seen|Its darkest form, deceit
Nothing else could taste this warm|Or feel this sweet
So you gonna stay mad at me forever?
It ain't even about that, bro.
I mean, Iike, when you was a baby,|I couIdn't waIk for you.
And I can't waIk for you now.
I'm sorry.
-Rashad, I'm not gonna be messing up.|-Hey, Ant.
I Iove you, regardIess.
I can teach you everything|under the sun...
...but I can't be a man for you.
You gotta figure out|the best way to do that yourseIf.
We didn't win Skate Wars that night.
But I got something better.
I got my friends, I got my girl,|and I got my little brother back.
Teddy finally graduated from high school.
He even opened up his own spot.|He call it ''Gangsta Grills. ''
But see, that's what I wanted, though.
Okay, weII, hey, if that what you want,|I got my money, we straight.
-That's right.|-There it is.
Brooklyn finally found a job|he could keep.
CongratuIations.
Esquire got a mysterious|letter of recommendation...
...for the Falcon Scholarship.
Guess Garnett ain't so bad after all.
My boy's in the Ivy League.
Hey, get back up and try it again,|baby girIs.

-Get out of here.|-We know how to skate, okay?
-We getting up.|-This is so embarrassing.
Twins, well, they still at Cascade|every Sunday night.
Ghetto fabulous.
Uncle George quit dealing|with them dating services...

She's nice.
New New finally convinced her parents|that Spelman was right for her.
I'm glad she's close.
My little brother let go of all his|dope-boy ambitions...
...and finally got it together.
I'm proud of him.
As for me...
...I never realized I was dreaming|all along...
...because I was always drawing.
My pop said I'd put these skates down|when I found something more important.
I think he was right.
This is the beginning.
