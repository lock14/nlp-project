{1155}{1251}When you got responsibilities,|you ain't got time to dream.
{1313}{1424}I guess it's the difference between|being a boy and a man.

{140690}{140738}I'm his daddy now.
{140901}{140928}Get out the way.
{141218}{141262}Pleasure turns to the pain
{141267}{141354}Of the lessons learned from the strain|Of the questions burned in my brain
{141359}{141410}About whether love is humane|In its touch.
{141452}{141483}These thoughts are like salmon
{141488}{141543}Swimming upstream|In the tears of your deceit
{141549}{141611}Fighting the current hurt|That kills more than is created
{141617}{141675}By the chaos of our intertwined emotions
{141680}{141737}Chaotic because the anchor|Of Eros' arrow
{141742}{141825}Has been plucked from the vessel|Of my undying infatuation
{141825}{141908}Separation not as simple|As the distance between us
{141913}{141968}My mind no longer possessed|By the demons
{141973}{142051}That had been the overseers|Of my enslavement to your lies
{142056}{142107}The seeds of these lies|Rooted so deeply
{142112}{142199}They have cracked the foundation|Of what we once shared
{142204}{142281}Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside|To gush out like a river
{142300}{142364}Ripping the image of our future together|From my thoughts
{142370}{142440}As violently and as brutally|As if it were a child being taken
{142445}{142490}From his mother's arms
{142495}{142550}I'm left surrounded in darkness
{142550}{142607}But I refuse to be swallowed by it
{142612}{142745}My loneliness like the night air.|Invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch
{142750}{142802}In its cold uncomfortableness
{142807}{142857}y et if I could do it all over again
{142862}{142924}I'd do it in the same skin I'm in
{142929}{142985}To lay down and let love die
{142990}{143048}Just stay down and let love lie
{143053}{143119}No, no, not I
{143124}{143181}I'll stay 'round and let love fly
{143186}{143258}Even though I have seen|Its darkest form, deceit
{143263}{143354}Nothing else could taste this warm|Or feel this sweet
{143945}{143989}So you gonna stay mad at me forever?
{144125}{144191}It ain't even about that, bro.
{144282}{144382}I mean, Iike, when you was a baby,|I couIdn't waIk for you.
{144414}{144479}And I can't waIk for you now.
{144521}{144567}I'm sorry.
{144577}{144678}-Rashad, I'm not gonna be messing up.|-Hey, Ant.
{144704}{144746}I Iove you, regardIess.
{144759}{144844}I can teach you everything|under the sun...
{144849}{144917}...but I can't be a man for you.
{144955}{145043}You gotta figure out|the best way to do that yourseIf.
{145327}{145383}We didn't win Skate Wars that night.
{145388}{145432}But I got something better.
{145437}{145570}I got my friends, I got my girl,|and I got my little brother back.
{145627}{145700}Teddy finally graduated from high school.
{145701}{145789}He even opened up his own spot.|He call it ''Gangsta Grills. ''
{145795}{145844}But see, that's what I wanted, though.
{145849}{145932}Okay, weII, hey, if that what you want,|I got my money, we straight.
{145938}{145978}-That's right.|-There it is.
{146106}{146200}Brooklyn finally found a job|he could keep.
{146254}{146304}CongratuIations.
{146568}{146627}Esquire got a mysterious|letter of recommendation...
{146632}{146685}...for the Falcon Scholarship.
{146691}{146762}Guess Garnett ain't so bad after all.
{146767}{146848}My boy's in the Ivy League.
{147019}{147076}Hey, get back up and try it again,|baby girIs.
{147076}{147150}Skateman says get back up, try it again.
{147159}{147214}-Get out of here.|-We know how to skate, okay?
{147219}{147268}-We getting up.|-This is so embarrassing.
{147273}{147348}Twins, well, they still at Cascade|every Sunday night.
{147354}{147403}Ghetto fabulous.
{147445}{147504}Uncle George quit dealing|with them dating services...
{147509}{147573}...and went to church|and got him a real woman.
{147579}{147611}She's nice.
{147706}{147806}New New finally convinced her parents|that Spelman was right for her.
{147811}{147845}I'm glad she's close.
{148184}{148252}My little brother let go of all his|dope-boy ambitions...
{148253}{148304}...and finally got it together.
{148310}{148356}I'm proud of him.
{148507}{148540}As for me...
{148545}{148615}...I never realized I was dreaming|all along...
{148620}{148654}...because I was always drawing.
{148880}{148992}My pop said I'd put these skates down|when I found something more important.
{148997}{149050}I think he was right.
{149165}{149203}This is the beginning.
{149265}{149365}
