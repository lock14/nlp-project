Kekexi I i,



the last virgin
wi lderness of China.



This plain nearly
four mi les high,



is the only remaining habitat
of the Tibetan antelope.



In 1985



Poachers began hunting
antelopes for their fine wool



which was prized in
foreign markets.



Within a few years,



the number of antelopes plunged
from one mi I l ion to
under ten thousand.



To fight the poachers, a volunteer
civi I ian patrol was formed in 1993.



It was led by Ritai
a retired Tibetan army officer.



The patrol fought fierce
battles with the poachers



and aroused the attention
of the outside wor ld.



In the winter of 1996,



Poachers murdered
one of the patrolmen.



My newspaper quickly
sent me to cover the story.
