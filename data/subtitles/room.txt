1
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,650
Shit.

2
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,152
Sam.

3
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:24,817
Sam, wake up.

4
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,117
What's wrong?

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,850
Fuck.

6
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,685
What'd you do, Tiger?

7
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:35,051
- When did we crash?
- You tell us, asshole.

8
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,617
I guess I fell asleep.

9
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,651
Yeah...

10
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:40,518
with the engine running.

11
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,085
Fully charged.

12
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,251
Did you kill the battery too?

13
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,951
You hear the radio?

14
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:56,518
There's a skating rink
about 11 miles from here.

15
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,018
Big parking lot.

16
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,850
Ice skating
or rollerskating?

17
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:01,951
Just says they're open.

18
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:02,885
Why?

19
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,751
Hockey players whoop more ass.

20
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,117
I don't know, dude. I've seen some
pretty bad-ass roller skaters.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,784
At 7:00 AM?

22
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,051
All right,
I'll come with.

23
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,817
- Sam?
- Tad.

24
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,450
Awesome.

25
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,082
Hey, I work nights, but I'll catch
up with you guys for breakfast.

26
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:00,283
- Okay.
- I'm in 2-R up the stairs.

27
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:02,951
Just crash wherever.
Uh, park in the side lot.

28
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,918
Rear doors tight to the walls
so no one steals your shit.

29
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,151
All right.

30
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,818
Yeah?

31
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:27,550
These all have mushrooms.

32
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:28,951
This dude's legit.

33
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,216
Why? 'Cause he wakes up
at 5:00 in the morning

34
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,817
to put jizz in his hair?

35
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,050
Mm...

36
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,117
No. He's true.

37
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:43,718
Ree-Ree.

38
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,884
Who you callin'?

39
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,518
Is that your business?

40
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,050
I get the bills.

41
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,850
I'm going to bed.

42
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,584
We're gonna drink.

43
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,117
<i>♪ One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four ♪

44
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,117

45
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:22,750

46
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,718
Hello.

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,637
You were the first
to fall asleep?

48
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:40,617
Okay, I'm with the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.

49
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,216
Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.

50
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:45,850
Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.

51
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,084
Not for the zine?

52
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,718
I'll do
a print version for that,

53
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,518
but this will run
on our college station.

54
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,617
Uh, if that's cool.

55
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,584
Yeah.

56
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,216
So, you guys working
on anything new?

57
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:56,750
Mm, yeah. A few songs.

58
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,617
Maybe enough for,
like, a seven inch.

59
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,216
Sweet. Will you
actually press one?

60
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,685
Yeah, if we can afford it.

61
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,584
Yeah, no, I really dig
the analog style.

62
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:04,951
Uh, which brings
me to the fact

63
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,617
you guys are hard to find.

64
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,283
Why no social media presence?

65
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,718
That's because
booking more shows,

66
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,617
selling more records
would blow.

67
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,750
It's not hard rock.

68
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:16,151
No one wants to starve, but...

69
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,117
when you take it all virtual,
you lose...

70
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,951
the texture.

71
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:26,617
- What do you mean "texture"?
- Just... you gotta be there.

72
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,151
The music is for effect.

73
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:32,016
It's time and aggression...

74
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,518
Technical wizardry.

75
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,651
And it's shared live...

76
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,016
and then it's over.

77
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,884
The energy can't last.

78
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,651
Unless you're Iggy Pop.

79
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,216
Yeah, well good for him,
but I don't think I wanna

80
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:48,084
be in my 70's still listening
to Minor Threat.

81
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,518
- But Tiger does.
- I won't live to be 70, so...

82
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,216
Okay, so, uh,
this is a good seg

83
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,550
into one of my traditions.

84
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,518
Uh, for each of you,
name your desert island band.

85
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,050
Only one?

86
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,151
If I were to
say Black Sabbath,

87
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,550
would I get
Ozzy and Dio?

88
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,916
No caveats.
Just name the band.

89
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,016
Okay.

90
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,817
Misfits.

91
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,550
No, The Damned.

92
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:14,050
- Um...
- Oh, fuck it. Misfits.

93
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,983
- Poison Idea.
- Cro-Mags.

94
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,651
That's a good one also.

95
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,151
Why don't you say
something, dude?

96
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,617
What about Steely Dan?

97
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,084
- Hm. No, Candlebox.
- He's a juggalo.

98
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,850
- Uh... uh...
- Britney Spears?

99
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,584
Hey... hey, you...
you... you're gonna

100
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,283
edit this, right?
I can chop it up a bit.

101
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,283
- Oh, you should let it go raw, man.
- Um, when is this gonna air?

102
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,151
Like, maybe we should
plug the show?

103
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:39,283
Yeah. Um...

104
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:44,718
My last show at The Muni Center
didn't end well.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,584
Uh, lots of vomit,
some fecal matter.

106
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,817
County commissioner got wind
and pulled my permit.

107
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,216
You guys were
already en route.

108
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,584
No, you gotta
give us a kill fee.

109
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,850
- We went 90 miles out of our way.
- I've got a backup lined up.

110
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,050
Um, lunch,
50% cut on the door,

111
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,718
and you guys would headline.

112
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,550
Is anyone still on the bill?

113
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,817
No.

I gave you my cut.

125
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,884
Uh, the house got theirs,
but I didn't...

126
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:53,017
Split four ways,
it's six bucks each.

127
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,783
$6.87.

128
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,684
.88 if you just round up...

129
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:59,116
You dip-shit, fashion punk
clown motherfucker.

130
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,116
- Christ.
- Now easy there, jiu-jitsu.

131
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,350
Yeah. We don't wanna
go to jail, too.

132
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,283
I think you just ended this tour.
Fuck yes. Let's call it.

133
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:11,083
All right, so we'd
have to beeline to DC.

134
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,518
We have enough
for one tank.

135
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,817
We'd have to siphon
the rest of the way.

136
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,817
That's not a problem.

137
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:16,717
We got rice and beans.

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,216
We can head up north.
Take the 80 all the way.

139
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,717
What the fuck
you doing, man?

140
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,817
Let me call my cousin.

141
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,250
I can get you guys
a solid gig.

142
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:25,783
Where? Here?

143
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:26,817
Scene is dead.

144
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,897
You'd have to dip
down closer to Portland.

145
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,783
I say we just gank his vinyl.

146
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,817
All right, so all set.

147
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,951
Uh, matinée tomorrow.

148
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,850
Door's at 1:00,
you guys are on at 3:00.

149
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,684
- I texted the addy.
- How much?

150
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,084
Uh, $350.

151
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,585
Minus your tab.

152
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:54,051
And, um, just so you know,
it's mostly boots and braces down there.

153
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,551
Skins? There's some
at every show.

154
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,283
What? D.M.S.? Sharp?

155
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,750
Uh, right-wing,
or technically ultra-left,

156
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,283
but not affiliated.

157
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,750
- And your cousin's cool?
- Yeah, yeah.

158
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,083
Uh, don't talk politics,
but stick with Daniel.

159
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,585
I'd tag along, but he and his
girl are coming here to crash.

160
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,618
Gotta vacuum and shit.

161
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,716
So they're not,
like, burning crosses

162
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,716
or anything, right?
Like, we just play rock?

163
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,551
Uh, I'd play
your earlier stuff.

164
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,216
Heavier stuff.

165
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,283
I usually keep the originals,
but since this one never happened...

166
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:23,917
Can I still
run that interview?

167
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,150
Yeah.

168
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,585
What station is it on?

169
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,183
Uh, FM 85.5.

170
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,750
Breakfast With Champions.

171
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,150
- Thanks.
- Yo, Tadpole...

172
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,585
I'm sorry I almost
obliterated you, man.

173
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:35,984
Not a problem.

174
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,183
Take it easy.

175
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:53,250
At least the dude can draw.

176
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,716
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

177
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:09,183
Yo, Pat...

178
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:13,264
you know, there's something
I've never told people...

179
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,984
or anyone,

357
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,830
Go.

358
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,182
All right, that's it.

359
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,650
Okay, let me see it.

360
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:54,717
The knife.

361
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,616
It's an inch too short
for felony possession,

362
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,817
so you don't have to worry
about the...

363
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,250
Actually, give me
that money back.

364
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,549
What?

365
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:02,650
It's like vouchers
and shit.

366
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,529
We'll hold it for you.
Come on.

367
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,809
If you do any time,
we'll double it.

368
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,115
Now talk to 'em.

369
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,916
- You the victim?
- Yes, officer.

370
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,049
Kneel down.

371
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,851
Both of you,
ankles crossed.

372
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,115
That's the owner.

373
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:37,317
I called him too.

374
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:42,517
All right, let's give them
some room to work, folks.

375
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,049
Are you the owner?

376
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,849
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,683
Cowcatcher, clear out.

378
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:12,916
Hey, where are the cops?

379
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,750
- Get your stuff, man.
- What about us?

380
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:16,982
What are you doing?

381
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:20,083
We're sorting it out.
Just hang tight, Amber.

382
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,784
Your set was pretty good.

383
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:35,650
What?

384
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,950
What was the name
of your second to last song?

385
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:45,683
Uh...

386
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,584
To... Toxic Evolution.

387
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:53,750
It's fucking hard, man.

388
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,115
That's the one
I did her to.

389
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:14,083
All right, he's got
six bullets...

390
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,982
- For real?
- ...if we all go at once...

391
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:17,849
- Guys, hold off a sec.
- For what?

392
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:20,049
- We haven't done anything!
- It doesn't matter.

393
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:23,517
Okay.
They're called cartridges.

394
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,849
The bullet is the part
that enters your brain

395
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,115
if you keep talking shit.

396
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:33,215
And this gun only has
five cartridges, not six,

397
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:37,250
'cause they're big as fuck
and only five fit the cylinder.

398
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:43,584
So, please shut the fuck up
and don't test me.

399
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:44,982
Reece, you're making it worse.

400
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,250
We sit and we wait.

401
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,950
And we die?

402
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,650
Not if you sit
and you wait.

403
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:55,584
It's just the one
to 911 at 3:45

404
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:58,222
and then mine was at 3:47.
You called?

405
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,683
- 911 called back and I answered.
- Be clear.

406
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:03,250
Who else knows besides...
You said Daniel's cousin?

407
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,701
Tad.

408
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,150
There was a text from him
last night with our address,

409
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,215
but he doesn't know anything.

410
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:10,016
Except who they are,
where they are...

411
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:12,982
maybe where
they're supposed to be next.

412
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:14,349
Fuck.

413
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:16,950
Check emails.

414
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:19,150
They played their set
to the crowd.

415
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,150
Then we'll assume
the wide world knows

416
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,250
and they'll be tracking that.

417
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:24,683
Give it to me.

418
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,049
I was trying to
buy some time

419
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,784
and contain this
until we could...

420
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:29,517
Contain?

421
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,848
It was pretty rapid fire.

422
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:35,616
I appreciate your initiative
and we all love Werm.

423
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,915
He's a brother.

424
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,584
And you might have
visited him in prison.

425
00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:42,182
Makes a difference.

426
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:45,782
Now we're all
in the stew

427
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,182
for an impulsive act,

428
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:50,683
for a selfish act,

429
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:53,549
under my roof.

430
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,848
You see a way
out of this?

431
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:58,215
For them?

432
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:59,584
No.

433
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:00,982
We still have to find one.

434
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:07,816
Okay. This is good.

435
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:12,567
No guns.

436
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,016
You have a "No trespassing" sign
posted at the residence?

437
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,616
We got
"Beware of dogs."

438
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,915
That's better.

439
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,049
Does anyone even
know we're in here?

440
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,883
No one who cares. Tad?

441
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,717
- I think we go.
- I think we go too.

442
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,517
The next person that moves...

443
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,517
Everyone okay?

444
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,549
Just about.

445
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,848
Gabe?

446
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:45,950
- Yeah. Open up.
- No!

447
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,250
- Where are the cops?
- Okay...

448
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,517
do you want
me to open the door,

449
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,650
or do you want me to blow
your fucking head off?

450
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,650
- Back the fuck off!
- What's going on?

451
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:54,749
They're trying to run at me!

452
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,915
Do not shoot them!

453
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,082
You know what?
That's on them.

454
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:58,083
Where are the cops?

455
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,683
Give them the gun!

456
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,883
Say again?

457
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,549
It's over!

458
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:04,950
Give them the gun.

459
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:07,215
Okay, I told you they just
tried to run at me...

460
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:08,782
Then take the bullets out!

461
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:09,982
Just hand it over now!

462
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:11,950
Do not shoot them!

463
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:13,317
Is Darcy here?

464
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,549
- He is.
- I am.

465
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,915
Gentlemen, I'm the owner.
Okay, why the fuck didn't you just tell me?

466
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,282
Truly sorry about this.

467
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:24,282
Playing catch-up here myself.

468
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:25,982
They're playing
a fucking show.

469
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:28,150
Uh...

470
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:30,749
thank you, but...

471
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,549
we open the door
for the police,

472
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,883
or we keep the bullets.

473
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,715
Uh, the cartridges.

474
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:38,982
I've got no problem with that.

475
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:41,115
Okay, I handed them the gun.

476
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,883
I'm gonna head out now.
No, you're not.

477
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:44,732
- Let him open the door.
- Hang on.

478
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,583
- No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun...
- Nobody is...

479
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,517
letting me do anything.
I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?

480
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,848
- So how are we doing?
- He's right.

481
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:52,749
Pat, do the math.

482
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,782
- Where are the police?
- It takes a while out here.

483
00:27:56,785 --> 00:28:00,049
- Stay back.
- Just want to make sure that no one else gets hurt

484
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:02,083
in the meantime.

485
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:05,040
Okay, I gave you the damn gun...

486
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,215
Tiger!

487
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:12,715
- Get him down!
- Justin?

488
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:13,982
Get him down!

489
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:18,403
What's happening?

490
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,049
Shh!

491
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,584
Justin?

492
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:29,215
Shouldn't have locked the door.

493
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:30,648
Shit. Sam!

494
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,116
Get the bullets!

495
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,232
All right, load the gun.

496
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:43,647
- How's it going in there?
- Not good!

497
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,083
Fine, but we would rather
wait for the police!

498
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,615
Justin?

499
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,257
He's fine...

500
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:53,182
but he's gonna wait too!

501
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:58,016
Understood, gentlemen.

502
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:00,183
Hold tight.

503
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,049
You think they know?

504
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,883
I think they're
smarter than you!

505
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:06,950
Darcy...

506
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,083
Man.

507
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:12,916
I apologize.

508
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:18,910
We'll do it here.
Stage it up the road. Okay.

509
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:29,648
- Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?
- So in a tournament,

510
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:33,549
I snap his arm or he taps out
and we all go get burgers.

511
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,115
- Snap it.
- Come on.

512
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:36,665
Look, we've got the gun.

513
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,215
Why don't we just let him...
Wait, wait. I don't want it.

514
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:39,883
All right? I don't...
I don't feel good with it.

515
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:41,182
Who wants it?

516
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:42,115
- Not me.
- Hm?

517
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,982
- No. I can't shoot.
- I can.

518
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,150
No, not you.

519
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:47,083
- Then fucking keep it.
- Keep it, Sam.

520
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,517
I'll take it
when I'm up.

521
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,749
When I let go...

522
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,150
what are you gonna do?

523
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,782
Butt-fuck everyone
in the room.

524
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:57,950
You're gonna sit
criss-cross applesauce.

525
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:00,182
Say it.

526
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:03,317
I'm gonna sit
criss-cross apple sau...

527
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,282
Nice.

528
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:08,682
Now lean against the chair.

529
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,083
Hey, is there another
way out of here?

530
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,317
No.

531
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:18,548
You fed 'em yet today?

532
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,816
It doesn't matter.

533
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,215
They're professionals.

534
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,982
You might lose
a couple by morning

535
00:30:22,984 --> 00:30:24,150
Maybe a bunch.

536
00:30:24,152 --> 00:30:25,782
Like I said, they're pros.

537
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,648
They earn.

538
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,215
You'll be compensated.

539
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,915
Christ. How many people
are on that list?

540
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:37,749
It's 1,200 for a prospect,

541
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,749
two for a bait dog.

542
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,049
No studs, no champs
unless you wanna pay

543
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,900
20 grand a head.

544
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,749
This might cost you
your livelihood, Clark.

545
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,648
As long as it doesn't
cost me mine, you're covered.

546
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:52,115
There are gonna be cops,
so clean up the residence.

547
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,150
Maybe leave a roach
in an ashtray.

548
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,682
Put Daniel on that door
and bring the van around.

549
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:58,982
Shit.

550
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:00,182
The keys.

551
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:03,016
They're with them,
I guess.

552
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:04,215
I don't know.
We need them.

553
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:06,215
I got a ton
of shit to do.

554
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:07,615
Go on.

555
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,848
This is a fire hazard.

556
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:16,049
I wouldn't put
Daniel on the door.

557
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,215
Fine. Plenty to do.

558
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:20,749
Where's Daniel?

559
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,588
He stepped out.
I'm covering.

560
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,115
Everything okay?

561
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:35,083
Meet me
at the utility shed.

562
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,982
This a new ride?

563
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,115
Yeah.

564
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,782
Just turning it over.

565
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:51,915
I think it's getting choked.

566
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:52,883
Wrong filter.

567
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:54,816
- She's a beaut.
- What's up?

568
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,282
Need some
of the squad.

569
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:57,749
Red laces only.

570
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,648
- Tonight?
- Now.

571
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,782
The list.

572
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,715
This is everybody
who knows?

573
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:06,083
Yeah. Including the band.

574
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,182
Knows what?

575
00:32:07,184 --> 00:32:08,615
Manageable.

576
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:11,583
From here on out,
not a single name gets added

577
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:13,049
unless they have red laces.

578
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:14,749
There's 80 people in there.

579
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,682
You plus four.

580
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,782
Give Gabe the keys
in case we have to play valet.

581
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,049
We're losing light.

582
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,655
- You got it?
- Yeah.

583
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:31,250
Whoa, watch out!

584
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,648
That could be asbestos.

585
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,715
- It's not asbestos.
- You don't have a phone, do you?

586
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,250
They took it.

587
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:41,282
Hers too.
I'm gonna search her, okay?

588
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,715
Careful. That one
could be a live wire.

589
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,516
It's a speaker wire.

590
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:06,049
What'd you find?

591
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,490
Uh...

592
00:33:10,018 --> 00:33:11,282
<i>"Fleisch Wolf"?

593
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,648
Uh... <i>fleisch</i> means...

594
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:14,982
uh, flesh.

595
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:16,548
Or meat.

596
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,150
Like a <i>fleisch</i> salad.
It's German.

597
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:20,250
So "Meat Wolf"?

598
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:21,690
Yeah.

599
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,115
This shit's solid.

600
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,036
- Great.
- There's nothing here.

601
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,816
Okay. Empty out your pockets.

602
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:34,936
Come search me, faggot.

603
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,016
Just shoot him.

604
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,982
Come on.

605
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:42,848
Can I get up?

606
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,489
On the chair.

607
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,615
Slowly. Slowly.

608
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,583
Turn 'em out.

609
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,250
Come on, man.
Other one.

610
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:18,182
Oh fuck.

611
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:20,215
Good call.

612
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,882
Turn it out,
for fuck's sake.

613
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:24,916
What is that?
Give that to me.

614
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,815
Hand it over!

615
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:28,050
Oops.

616
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,748
Wait, was that a phone?

617
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,182
Oh, shit. Point it... point it at the door.

618
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:34,583
- Point the gun at the door.
- Maybe it's the police. It's a raid.

619
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,250
- Are you serious?
- Shh!

620
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:37,914
- Fuck off, Ilsa!
- Yo, quiet, okay? Justin, don't move.

621
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,250
- Point the gun...
- Nobody move.

622
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,083
- Now if we get all behind...
- Nobody talk!

623
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:42,182
Careful now.

624
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:58,016
Smoke this.

625
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,382
Deal.

626
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,016
And if the cherry does
something that you don't like...

627
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:07,615
shoot.

628
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:10,335
Thank you, Amber.

629
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,115
Get comfortable.

630
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:26,016
Pretty smart for a Nazi.

631
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:27,695
I'm not a Nazi.

632
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:31,342
How do you fall
for this shit?

633
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:35,248
Let's just say the people who
were gonna hurt me weren't white.

634
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:37,016
Any of them women?

635
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,150
It's a problem
where I grew up.

636
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:41,248
- Guys.
- What about tonight?

637
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,983
I think we got a white people
- Reece: Guys! Shh.

638
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,623
Oh, fuck you.

639
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:06,215
It looks like we tripped our main.

640
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:08,815
Our back-up gennie is fired up,
but we're gonna to have to

641
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:11,050
call it a day
and do some troubleshooting.

642
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,983
We'll try again on Sunday.

643
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:14,181
No door charge.

644
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:17,115
Hell, free drinks from 2:00 to 4:00.

645
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:35,916
Those of you attending the racial
advocacy workshop on Wednesday,

646
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:38,648
assume it's on
unless you hear otherwise.

647
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,248
And remember...

648
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:44,050
this is a movement,
not a party.

649
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:45,215
All right.

650
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:47,315
Stay safe!
Godspeed.

651
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,248
Who hasn't smoked yet?

652
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:56,695
All right, you guys are
gonna come with me.

653
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,396
You're not
worried they'll talk?

654
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,815
They've got priorities.

655
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:26,248
Tell them the party is on us if
they hole up for a couple of days.

656
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:28,583
Put this fire out first.

657
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:29,916
Grove Street?

658
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:33,682
My dope nigger stamps
in case one of these meat-heads

659
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,715
gets booked
for possession.

660
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:37,782
All right.

661
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:39,916
Let's get y'all
somewhere safe.

662
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:54,148
Treasure?

663
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,782
Daylight. Underneath.

664
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,181
They're moving our gear.

665
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,148
- Yes?
- Gentlemen?

666
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,081
We're loading you out.

667
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,048
Are there cops here?

668
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,248
They've come and gone.
It got a little complicated.

669
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,282
We're so fucked.

670
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:17,048
Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

671
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,081
Can you hear me
if I speak at this volume?

672
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,248
- Yeah.
- Yes.

673
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:23,615
Good.

674
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:24,615
Um...

675
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:27,782
and can we please
elect just one voice?

676
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:32,715
Yes.

677
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:35,748
Okay. Now, you're trapped.

678
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:37,548
That's not a threat.
It's a fact.

679
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,583
Well, we have a loaded gun.

680
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:41,148
That's also just a fact.

681
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,048
Oh, we have plenty
more guns on hand.

682
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,715
We just want you out.

683
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:48,048
Not harmed.

684
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:53,583
Now, the firearm you have
is not registered.

685
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:57,648
I wanted it out of the picture
before the authorities arrived,

686
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,615
but you refused,
so here we are.

687
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:00,983
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

688
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:03,615
Here we are.

689
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:06,715
Oh, I do apologize for
my associates. They panicked.

690
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:09,114
- Yeah, no shit! Man, we're...
- Listen! Listen!

691
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:13,148
No one is trying
to wipe the slate clean.

692
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,583
Whatever you saw or did
is no longer my concern.

693
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:20,782
You tell whoever you want
whatever you want.

694
00:39:20,784 --> 00:39:25,181
All I ask is that you
understand you were held here

695
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,148
for your own safety
before you were released.

696
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:34,583
Okay.

697
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,916
Yes. Thank you.

698
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,048
But just...

699
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,248
just to be clear...

700
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:44,849
the police are coming back?

701
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:46,715
They've come and gone.

702
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,215
Well, that's what
concerns us, man!

703
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:52,349
I just want that gun
out of the picture.

704
00:39:57,684 --> 00:39:59,014
Okay.

705
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:02,583
- Careful, man.
- Sorry.

706
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,815
- What do we do?
- We dig through the fucking floor.

707
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:06,416
While we just wait?

708
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,014
They could shoot us at any time.
Yeah, but they haven't.

709
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:09,648
How do we even know
that they have guns?

710
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,748
They have guns.
No question.

711
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,215
We're gonna trust you?

712
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:17,114
- We've got zero leverage.
- Ask for a phone...

713
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,615
for the gun.
All right.

714
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,248
- What about him?
- Yeah, I mean, the minute we give it up,

715
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:24,568
what if he just, like, attacks?
Then I'll wrap him up.

716
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:26,882
Okay.

717
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,181
So we see what they think?
Mmhmm.

718
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:33,583
All right.

719
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:38,815
Uh, we'll give you
the gun for a cell phone.

720
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,248
Sorry, no.

721
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:44,081
- Okay, well, how about a registered firearm?
- Funny.

722
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,715
Justin, you alive and well?

723
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:49,215
- I'm alive.
- Okay, good.

724
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:54,048
Gentlemen, I hope
you appreciate the situation.

725
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:58,081
Things have gone south,
no doubt.

726
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:02,748
But you know if you don't
hand over that gun,

727
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,148
it won't end well.

728
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,949
You see...

729
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:10,748
for all I know, I...
I come to my place of business

730
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,782
and there is
an out of town band

731
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:15,282
locked in a room
with an unregistered firearm.

732
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,849
- Oh, come on!
- And somebody's hurt inside there

733
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,914
and maybe there's
a hostage, too!

734
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,782
So what do I do?

735
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:28,548
Am I within my rights
to intervene?

736
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,181
Should I kick down the door
and start shooting?

737
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,882
Or...

738
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:38,181
can we just remove
the guns from the equation?

739
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:40,282
These are my questions.

740
00:41:40,284 --> 00:41:42,949
You've got
30 seconds to answer.

741
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:46,148
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

742
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,081
Great. Anyone got
any smart ideas?

743
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,981
Justin, get on the floor.

744
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:55,648
Get on the fuckin' floor
right now. Go.

745
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,548
All right. Sam,
come around here.

746
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,081
- Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me.
- Okay.

747
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,961
- You got it?
- Got it.

748
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,282
Okay. Nice and easy.

749
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:09,583
Play nice,
and I'll be nice.

750
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:10,949
Please.

751
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:12,500
Don't do anything.

752
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,048
- This is fuckin' retarded.
- No one's saying it isn't,

753
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,615
but we either hand over the gun
or we open fire with it.

754
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,682
- I vote for that.
- You don't have a vote, okay?

755
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,715
I mean we're taking
chances either way, so...

756
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:22,949
So we're fuckin' dead, guys.

757
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:24,847
At least this way,
we find out

758
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:27,048
if all we're doing now
is buying time.

759
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,548
- For them.
- Amen.

760
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,715
At this point,
I'm just fucking curious.

761
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:39,014
Okay...
we'll give you the gun.

762
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,847
But we're gonna
keep the ammo.

763
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:45,282
Fine. Safer for everyone.

764
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:48,516
All right, let's move
this fucking couch.

765
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:49,956
Okay.

766
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,914
All right, keep still.

767
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:10,181
Okay, stand back!

768
00:43:10,184 --> 00:43:11,862
You've got it.

769
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,048
Here we go.

770
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:27,516
May I approach?

771
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:28,882
No!

772
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:30,882
No. I'm gonna throw it.

773
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,315
Careful. It was a gift.

774
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,181
- They're killing us!
- Keep the gun!

775
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:46,782
Get the fuck off of me!

776
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,215
Okay, okay!

777
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:51,648
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

778
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,949
Fuck you!

779
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,548
Oh, my God!

780
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,215
Keep it up! Pull it up!

781
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:08,715
Oh fuck.

782
00:44:10,518 --> 00:44:12,315
Yo, help me
move the couch.

783
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:16,782
Help me move it!

784
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:18,882
Oh, shit!

785
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:23,949
This will be over soon, gentlemen.

786
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:32,981
I'll fuckin' crush you.

787
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:44,643
Get the box cutter!

788
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,615
Get the fucking box cutter
out of his hand!

789
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,148
- Tell me when he's out!
- Okay!

790
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,282
Pat! Pat!

791
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:00,815
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

792
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:02,014
Shush! Shush!

793
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:03,181
Shush!

794
00:45:04,684 --> 00:45:06,981
He's out. He's out!

795
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:11,949
Oh, fuck.

796
00:45:11,951 --> 00:45:15,148
Put pressure on it!
Put pressure!

797
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,681
I know, I know, I know.

798
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:18,949
Just breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

799
00:45:18,951 --> 00:45:21,248
He's not out!

800
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,282
He's not out!

801
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:26,748
You got this?

802
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,614
How long does it take...

803
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:52,681
until we know... for sure?

804
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:58,715
What the...

805
00:45:58,717 --> 00:45:59,782
Oh, Jesus.

806
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:06,014
Oh, Jesus.

807
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:17,748
Any and all firearms,

808
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,949
Clark will handle it
from here on.

809
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:21,548
He give you an E.T.A.?

810
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,181
You said no calls.

811
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:24,882
Right. Good.

812
00:46:24,884 --> 00:46:26,548
Phones too.
What happened in there?

813
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,349
Set Neal up for tomorrow

814
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:30,148
New drywall, pour a floor.
Tell him we had a leak.

815
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,548
Door with a frame, too.
What happened?

816
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,882
Uh, a bit of
a maelstrom tonight.

817
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:37,648
Visiting band hurt
one of ours.

818
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,882
Who?

819
00:46:38,884 --> 00:46:40,581
Emily.

820
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,516
Maybe Big Justin, too.

821
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:43,648
What the fuck
are we doing then?

822
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,715
Let's get in there.

823
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:49,516
We're not coming apart
is what we are doing.

824
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:54,547
We're saving questions until this
pig fuck is transferred off-site.

825
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,048
Darcy.

826
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:01,114
Okay. Last chance
if anyone needs to take a leak.

827
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,514
I lost the gun.

828
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:38,114
You held on longer
than I would have.

829
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,547
Hey.

830
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,081
I'm going.

831
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:49,181
There's no air shaft,
there's no sewer system...

832
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:51,614
no nothing.

833
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:54,422
There it is.

834
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:00,114
What time is it?

835
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:01,614
It's not daylight.

836
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:03,114
It's something.

837
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:04,815
Out the way.

838
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,315
Oh, fuck.

839
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:37,349
Look for a door.

840
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:44,362
Just let me know.

841
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,648
Hey...

842
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,581
I'm sorry
about your friend.

843
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,048
Shit!

844
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:04,782
Okay, move.

845
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,262
Fuck!

846
00:49:18,817 --> 00:49:20,014
Is there a lock?

847
00:49:20,016 --> 00:49:22,914
Other side, maybe.

848
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,914
We're burning time.

849
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,148
Wait, but...

850
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,181
Look! There's...
there's ventilation!

851
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:29,715
Six inch ducts.
Good luck.

852
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,514
Shouldn't we look around more?

853
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:32,882
We just did!

854
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:35,215
Go. Go, go. Push.

855
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,882
Heroin.

856
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:48,882
It's not about her or us.

857
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,581
It's a... it's
a big ass bunker.

858
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,282
- Give me your hand.
- Big ass dead end.

859
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,782
Give it to me.
Hold it up, up, up.

860
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:58,114
All right. Look away, look away.

861
00:49:58,117 --> 00:49:59,614
Maybe we can use this
to our advantage.

862
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:01,215
We're done.

863
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:04,481
I'm done.

864
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:07,014
Okay? You can close the door behind
me if you want to strategize.

865
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:09,715
- We're not ready!
- What do you think they're doing out there?

866
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:11,648
- That's just it. We don't know.
- We fucking know

867
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,048
they mean us harm!

868
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,048
It's just that if have guns,

869
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,847
okay, why haven't
they mowed us down already?

870
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,847
We can't just go missing.

871
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,514
They need us found.

872
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:22,282
All right.
Grab some shit

873
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:23,282
and get ready to run.

874
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:24,648
Then we die.

875
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,748
Yeah, but the longer we wait,

876
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,248
the surer that is.

877
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,949
- Tiger, you ready?
- Yeah, almost, man.

878
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:35,347
We can't take it so seriously.

879
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,514
We gotta...

880
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:44,914
treat this like paintball.

881
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:47,748
What?

882
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,114
Rick Silva...

883
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:58,648
helped organize the paintball
for Skate-o's bachelor party.

884
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,882
And we were short a few players
to book the whole field,

885
00:51:02,884 --> 00:51:08,547
so they paired us up
with these ex-Marines.

886
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,215
And the first few rounds,
these guys just...

887
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:15,715
tore us to shreds.

888
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:18,914
I mean, zero casualties
on their side.

889
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:22,014
And I just cowered
behind these trees

890
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:23,981
till I got shot.

891
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:26,280
Covered in paint. But Rick...

892
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:28,181
Tiger, you done?

893
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:32,215
Okay.

894
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,715
Pat, you're done, too.

895
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,114
I'm sorry, man.
We gotta go.

896
00:51:35,117 --> 00:51:36,782
That's okay.

897
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:38,815
- Was that a pep talk?
- Ready?

898
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,782
Now we won't all live, but...

899
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:48,315
I don't know.
Maybe we won't all die.

900
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:56,547
- Here.
- No, I'm just gonna run.

901
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,108
I got it.

902
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,882
All right, fuck it.
Simon and Garfunkel.

903
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:06,815
Desert island band.

904
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:10,215
Prince.

905
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,581
I, uh...

906
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,148
- I'm still the Misfits.
- True school, man.

907
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,782
Are we going?

908
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:23,322
Yeah.

909
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:33,748
Madonna and... Slayer.

910
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,949
Here we go.

911
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:39,048
Watch it!

912
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,981
What the fuck?

913
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:46,815
They're letting us out.

914
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:48,048
How many exits are there?

915
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,949
Uh, the main, the back,
maybe the kitchen.

916
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,280
I always...
What about windows?

917
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:53,715
See for yourselves.

918
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,280
Fuck.

919
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:57,614
Quiet.

920
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,048
Oh, shit.

921
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,882
Should we hide?

922
00:53:03,884 --> 00:53:05,949
Uh, whatever you want, man.

923
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:15,581
We... we should split up.

924
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,048
Totally.

925
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:28,081
What the fuck?

926
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,648
Tiger!

927
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,782
Tiger!

928
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:40,181
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

929
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:46,148
Shit.

930
00:53:50,117 --> 00:53:51,715
Oh, shit!

931
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:57,181
Save it.

932
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:59,248
Oh, shit.

933
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,648
<i>Fass! Fass!

934
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,248
<i>Voran! Fass!

935
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,581
<i>Fass!

936
00:55:26,983 --> 00:55:28,213
Hey.

937
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,081
They're everywhere!

938
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,882
Where's Reece?

939
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:50,702
It's us.

940
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,681
Come on. Move.

941
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,114
Sam, look.

942
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,213
<i>Fleisch Wolf.

943
00:56:07,215 --> 00:56:08,949
It's a song.

944
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:12,248
It means "Meat Grinder."

945
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,248
Up! Up!

946
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,213
<i>So ist's brav.

947
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:19,715
<i>So ist's brav.

948
00:56:19,717 --> 00:56:21,547
You're retiring him?

949
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,581
He's worked up.

950
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,847
Send in another.

951
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:25,949
Send two.
Finish it.

952
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:28,047
Kill that feedback first.

953
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,280
And if I send in two fight dogs,
what do you think they'll do?

954
00:56:31,282 --> 00:56:33,248
Send me in there.
I'll finish up.

955
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,847
Just give me the rules.

956
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,213
All right.

957
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:40,081
Blades only.

958
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,081
Sloppy is fine.

959
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,114
Try not to hit the bone.

960
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:44,847
Okay.

961
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:46,514
Take Jonathan.

962
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:47,882
Brute squad.

963
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,762
Keep him caged
until we tag out.

964
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,280
He breathing?

965
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:03,782
A little bit, yeah.

966
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,014
Let him bleed.

967
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:08,947
Later is better
for time of death.

968
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:10,047
Keys?

969
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,014
No.

970
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,047
They're coming.

971
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:50,114
I can't do this.

972
00:57:56,717 --> 00:57:58,114
Get back!

973
00:57:58,115 --> 00:58:00,248
No!

974
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,715
Where's Emily?

975
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,213
What the fuck
are you doing?

976
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:11,681
Hey!

977
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,681
Which one did it?

978
00:58:15,684 --> 00:58:17,181
- Werm did it.
- Bullshit.

979
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:18,280
Which one?

980
00:58:18,282 --> 00:58:20,181
What did they tell you?

981
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,047
What? You want to know?

982
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,748
You want him to know?

983
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,148
Know what?

984
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,914
Werm found out
that she was leaving...

985
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:34,981
but she didn't say
that it was with you.

986
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,280
"Meat Grinder."

987
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:43,114
That song was their cue.

988
00:58:44,684 --> 00:58:46,047
You should go.

989
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:57,382
Here we go.

990
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,213
This is taking too long.

991
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,981
Gabe?

992
00:59:06,115 --> 00:59:09,213
You didn't want Daniel
on door duty.

993
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:10,681
Why?

994
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:15,213
Nothing concrete, he and...

995
00:59:15,215 --> 00:59:17,148
and Emily...

996
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,813
Little lovebirds.

997
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,648
Recognize this?

998
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,547
No, sir.

999
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,248
Of course not.
You were still handing out

1000
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,780
leaflets when these boys
made their bones.

1001
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,648
It's from last Easter.

1002
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,114
Supposed to disappear
after the boot party.

1003
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:27,981
He just started talking.

1004
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:29,746
Amber's alive
saying Werm did it.

1005
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:30,847
Never mind that.

1006
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,813
You...

1007
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:38,847
Werm saved us all.

1008
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,947
Sam?

1009
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,847
It's okay.

1010
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,514
I mean,
it's not okay.

1011
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:59,014
- You didn't know either?
- He's with us.

1012
01:00:59,016 --> 01:01:00,114
Not where.

1013
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,753
We gotta split.

1014
01:01:06,282 --> 01:01:09,014
This has a wider duct, I think.

1015
01:01:09,016 --> 01:01:11,947
We're not gonna
fit through there.

1016
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:13,648
Oh!

1017
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,148
Daniel, um, he can help.

1018
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,547
Why?

1019
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,148
Who's he?

1020
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,047
A traitor. If they don't
already know, they know now.

1021
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,746
I can get us out of here.

1022
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:25,681
Wow. A conspiracy.

1023
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,681
No, just a cluster-fuck.

1024
01:01:34,617 --> 01:01:37,681
There is still blades
and fangs for the visitors,

1025
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:39,780
but we are getting
lean on time.

1026
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:42,847
Now, if you have
to shoot, shoot once.

1027
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:45,081
If more than once,
keep it a tight grouping

1028
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,514
'cause you'll be digging
the slugs out yourself.

1029
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:49,474
As for Daniel and Amber,
they can...

1030
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:56,347
What did we forget?

1031
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:09,081
There's a river on two sides.
The quarry's on another.

1032
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,213
We can parallel the main road back,
go for help.

1033
01:02:12,215 --> 01:02:14,213
Well, how do we get
past the door?

1034
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,947
I know something you don't.

1035
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,746
Good. What?

1036
01:02:17,748 --> 01:02:19,581
I know where we keep...

1037
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,713
Too slow.

1038
01:02:57,215 --> 01:02:59,181
Should we go?

1039
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:00,681
Now?

1040
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:02,148
We have the gun.

1041
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:04,014
I guess.

1042
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:05,547
Yes.

1043
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,914
Yes!

1044
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,014
Give me two.

1045
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,514
Easy! Not her!

1046
01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:35,114
Don't fire!

1047
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:36,213
<i>Fass! Fass!

1048
01:03:36,215 --> 01:03:37,248
<i>Fass!

1049
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,947
Go!

1050
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,081
Sam!

1051
01:03:42,182 --> 01:03:43,248
Sam!

1052
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:54,947
We're never getting out.

1053
01:04:00,282 --> 01:04:01,780
Fuck.

1054
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,114
You know, I'm lucky.

1055
01:04:26,115 --> 01:04:29,280
I guessed at least
they were gonna shoot me.

1056
01:04:40,282 --> 01:04:41,981
Three'll do, gentlemen.

1057
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,547
The fourth can disappear.

1058
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:44,981
It's time to start
the clean-up.

1059
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:47,547
I'm gonna need
a push broom.

1060
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:50,514
This is supposed to
have happened already.

1061
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,355
- Time to sprint.
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:04:53,648 --> 01:04:55,248
Well done.

1063
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:57,347
Thank him.

1064
01:04:59,648 --> 01:05:03,280
Nearly got away
from me. Us.

1065
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:11,248
Shouldn't we be panicking?

1066
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:17,213
I'm hungry.

1067
01:05:24,715 --> 01:05:27,813
I can't die here with you.

1068
01:05:29,548 --> 01:05:31,213
So don't.

1069
01:05:33,282 --> 01:05:36,813
You know, feel free just to...

1070
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:43,713
Hey, I want the rest
of your pep talk.

1071
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,947
Oh, no.
It no longer applies.

1072
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:50,213
Oh, come on.

1073
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:52,315
I'm curious.

1074
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:56,780
It was paintballing...

1075
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:59,114
you were cowering...

1076
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:04,114
Yeah, Rick Silva.

1077
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:11,746
We were getting slaughtered
by these legit Iraq vets.

1078
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:13,614
It totally applies.

1079
01:06:13,615 --> 01:06:18,914
Full camo, thousand-dollar
automatic paintball guns.

1080
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:25,780
They knew real war
and they played real war.

1081
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:31,014
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.

1082
01:06:31,016 --> 01:06:35,047
Just wiped us all out.

1083
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:42,181
So Rick gets fed up
and says, "Fuck it."

1084
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:45,713
Didn't care
about getting shot.

1085
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,780
Didn't care about taking cover.

1086
01:06:50,016 --> 01:06:51,813
It was hopeless, man.

1087
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:59,847
So the last match,
the whistle blows,

1088
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,014
and he just
tears out there,

1089
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:10,746
full jackass, in...
in sneakers and cut-offs

1090
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:15,114
and he... wipes out
their whole team.

1091
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,514
Doesn't stop.

1092
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:25,880
Just keeps running
and laughing and shooting...

1093
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:30,646
until they're all dead.

1094
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,114
Pretend dead.

1095
01:07:37,548 --> 01:07:40,713
And we're up
against real guns.

1096
01:07:40,715 --> 01:07:42,148
Yeah.

1097
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:49,081
Either way,
we can't play real war.

1098
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:17,148
Let's pretend.

1099
01:08:34,182 --> 01:08:35,314
For you.

1100
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:39,646
We're just mopping up tonight.

1101
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,581
You already earned these.

1102
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:48,180
Maybe push Neal,
depending on the mess,

1103
01:08:48,182 --> 01:08:50,081
to start looking
for a new house band.

1104
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:52,846
We've really gotta get
back to a routine.

1105
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:54,814
You think Cowcatcher's
gonna talk?

1106
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:57,680
I'm more worried
about their habits.

1107
01:08:57,682 --> 01:09:01,247
Really have to stay away
from that nigger dope.

1108
01:09:01,248 --> 01:09:04,247
There's a bad batch
doing the rounds.

1109
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,047
We're good to go.

1110
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:20,747
We're set.

1111
01:09:20,748 --> 01:09:23,706
This all hinges on nothing
having happened here.

1112
01:09:25,882 --> 01:09:26,921
Now, let's be clear.

1113
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:32,279
This should keep him alive
for another hour.

1114
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:34,546
I would consider it
a personal favor

1115
01:09:34,548 --> 01:09:36,466
if he dies with meat
in his teeth.

1116
01:09:38,815 --> 01:09:41,047
Come on. Come on.

1117
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:45,814
Bite command is <i>"fass."

1118
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:48,881
It's all you'll need.

1119
01:09:56,082 --> 01:09:59,546
Disregard. Just shoot
who is left.

1120
01:09:59,548 --> 01:10:01,279
They don't have to
be accounted for.

1121
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:03,913
Forensics is
no longer a concern.

1122
01:10:05,783 --> 01:10:08,948
We call this in late,
all is for naught.

1123
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,514
You guys got
any 12 gauge?

1124
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:17,581
Not in the office.
Try the bar.

1125
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,713
- How many shots you have left?
- Three.

1126
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,913
So you have one extra.

1127
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:36,780
No shells.

1128
01:10:40,215 --> 01:10:42,974
Behind the bar.
Better get started.

1129
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,581
Shit!

1130
01:10:58,882 --> 01:11:00,560
Easy! Easy!

1131
01:11:02,849 --> 01:11:04,047
Easy!

1132
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,847
No buckshot!

1133
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:28,514
What's happening?

1134
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:30,546
Dog freaked.
And turn this shit off!

1135
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:32,247
I tried! It's not coming
from our mixer.

1136
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:33,881
Go! We got this.

1137
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:36,646
And don't tell Darcy.
Or Clark.

1138
01:11:40,515 --> 01:11:42,073
We going?
Yeah.

1139
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,963
Hey!

1140
01:11:45,965 --> 01:11:48,012
Down there, you dip-shit fashion
punk clown motherfuckers!

1141
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:49,581
- Turn around!
<i>- Shazbot!

1142
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:51,613
What? What...
Who is that?

1143
01:11:51,615 --> 01:11:53,613
Odin himself.

1144
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:22,247
Give me the shotgun.

1145
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:23,747
No, I got the shotgun.

1146
01:12:23,748 --> 01:12:26,180
Then you go down
this fucking hole.

1147
01:12:28,748 --> 01:12:29,846
Three shots?

1148
01:12:29,849 --> 01:12:31,831
Yeah.

1149
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:33,814
You hear me fire twice,
you come down no matter what.

1150
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:35,814
- This is a trap.
- Yeah, no shit.

1151
01:12:35,815 --> 01:12:37,079
You wanna go tell Darcy?

1152
01:12:42,548 --> 01:12:44,247
He's gonna be pissed.

1153
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:49,881
Watch my back.

1154
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,646
Fuck this.

1155
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:20,247
Get Gabe, man!

1156
01:13:20,248 --> 01:13:22,012
We need two down here
and one up there.

1157
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:24,747
Who's got the nine?
I think Alan does, but I'm not sure-

1158
01:13:24,748 --> 01:13:27,247
Oh, fuck! Block it!

1159
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:30,427
Pat!

1160
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,079
He's got three shots left!

1161
01:13:33,082 --> 01:13:34,613
Bitch.

1162
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:46,680
Gabe!

1163
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:55,881
Amber!

1164
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:57,146
Yeah?

1165
01:13:57,149 --> 01:13:58,947
Uh...

1166
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:01,613
never mind!

1167
01:14:09,981 --> 01:14:11,713
Two shots left!

1168
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:22,680
Nice fuckin' try!

1169
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:26,680
Go fuck yourself!

1170
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:35,079
Shit. Shit.

1171
01:14:59,649 --> 01:15:00,880
Oh, shit!

1172
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,279
Pat!

1173
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,079
One shot left!

1174
01:15:12,082 --> 01:15:13,646
Fuck.

1175
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:22,814
Zero.

1176
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:30,980
Oh, shit!

1177
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:38,314
Get off of me!

1178
01:16:15,548 --> 01:16:16,880
Got him.

1179
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:20,279
Totally.

1180
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:25,180
Flabbergasted that motherfucker.

1181
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:47,680
If I had any idea...

1182
01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:54,220
Anymore dogs?

1183
01:16:56,515 --> 01:16:58,212
People?

1184
01:16:58,215 --> 01:16:59,845
No. Not here.

1185
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:03,046
They're... up the road.

1186
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:17,979
I don't want to go to jail.

1187
01:17:56,215 --> 01:17:59,279
Does anyone know
how to hotwire a car?

1188
01:17:59,282 --> 01:18:00,646
No.

1189
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,979
I'd stay off
the road anyway.

1190
01:18:20,114 --> 01:18:21,779
Are you gonna shoot me?

1191
01:18:23,082 --> 01:18:24,746
Where's Werm?

1192
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,813
- We sent him home...
- Stay quiet till we're out.

1193
01:18:52,747 --> 01:18:54,786
It's the residents.

1194
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:57,581
What are they doing?

1195
01:18:57,582 --> 01:18:59,979
Something you don't
want to see.

1196
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:04,947
We can call the cops
when we get to the orchard.

1197
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:11,712
Did you see them die?

1198
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,212
Two.

1199
01:19:15,215 --> 01:19:16,845
Not the third.

1200
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,046
I think I'm going.

1201
01:19:24,715 --> 01:19:26,912
You can call the cops
when you get there.

1202
01:19:26,914 --> 01:19:29,779
If you disappear,
I'll find you.

1203
01:19:29,782 --> 01:19:31,046
I will.

1204
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,212
I promise.

1205
01:19:39,248 --> 01:19:41,180
You should go, too.

1206
01:19:42,614 --> 01:19:44,346
Just hedge our bets.

1207
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,712
You got three rounds...

1208
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:51,613
and I've seen
you pump a shotgun.

1209
01:19:51,614 --> 01:19:53,813
Fair enough.

1210
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:10,746
Do you believe him?

1211
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:14,279
Shh.

1212
01:20:26,715 --> 01:20:28,146
<i>Nimm futter!

1213
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:32,279
<i>Nimm futter!

1214
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:40,212
<i>Nimm futter!

1215
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:42,180
<i>Nimm futter!
Nimm futter!

1216
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:45,012
- Jesus.
<i>- Nimm futter!

1217
01:20:46,547 --> 01:20:48,645
That ought to be enough.

1218
01:20:48,648 --> 01:20:50,680
<i>Lass es! Lass es!

1219
01:20:50,681 --> 01:20:51,912
<i>Lass es!

1220
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:54,079
<i>So ist's brav.

1221
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,346
<i>Aus. Aus.

1222
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:01,746
Wipe it down!

1223
01:21:05,015 --> 01:21:06,880
Do you think they'd
leave the engine on?

1224
01:21:06,881 --> 01:21:09,947
Yeah. It'll run
the gauge down too.

1225
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,146
Let's call this in.

1226
01:21:14,648 --> 01:21:16,180
<i>Aus. Aus.

1227
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,579
You got the dog?

1228
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:20,047
I got the dog.

1229
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:25,645
Tie him up.

1230
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,247
Give me your gun.

1231
01:21:29,248 --> 01:21:31,012
I don't have one.

1232
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:33,813
I'll shoot you either way
if you don't hand me one.

1233
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:42,346
Throw it.

1234
01:22:59,282 --> 01:23:01,012
They're making it our fault.

1235
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:05,947
You were trespassing.

1236
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:15,046
It looks fishy to me.

1237
01:23:15,048 --> 01:23:17,613
The cloth is
to make it seal.

1238
01:23:17,614 --> 01:23:19,314
I wouldn't do it like that.

1239
01:23:20,715 --> 01:23:21,746
They got my gun.

1240
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,506
- Shut up.
- Listen...

1241
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:40,813
So we're doing that?

1242
01:23:40,814 --> 01:23:43,146
Why else would
we walk up here?

1243
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:48,246
I don't know.
And I was gonna...

1244
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:51,579
ruin the crime scene.

1245
01:23:52,981 --> 01:23:54,012
Oh.

1246
01:23:54,015 --> 01:23:56,845
I thought we'd leave a new one.

1247
01:24:12,282 --> 01:24:14,012
This...

1248
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:17,279
is a nightmare.

1249
01:24:19,048 --> 01:24:20,313
For us all.

1250
01:24:21,782 --> 01:24:26,113
Tell me those stupid fucking
words are his last.

1251
01:24:34,614 --> 01:24:36,180
Do you have a phone?

1252
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:42,046
It's funny.

1253
01:24:43,747 --> 01:24:46,012
You were so scary at night.

1254
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,813
We need the police.

1255
01:26:16,614 --> 01:26:18,680
<i>Okay, I'm the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.

1256
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:20,546
<i>Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.

1257
01:26:20,547 --> 01:26:23,912
<i>Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.

1258
01:26:29,914 --> 01:26:31,279
<i>Yeah, if we can afford it.

1259
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,746
