5
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,006
Hey, Claire.
Wanna see something great?

6
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,008
Who else was there?

7
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,593
It's an igloo.

8
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,845
- And?
- I made it.

9
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,514
Yeah, my brother.

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,099
Hey, Claire.

11
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,810
I can't. We're supposed to
go to my dad's that weekend.

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,647
The snowplows left some snow
across the street, and I dug a hole into it.

13
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,607
Max, go and play with your friends.

14
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,628
You, go that way.

15
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,714
No, don't talk to me like that.
You're just a fence.

16
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,050
You can go play
with your own fence friends.

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,343
Now, move out!

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,445
So sweet. Yeah.
That's gonna be awesome.

19
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,700
- Hey, Claire. What's up? You ready?
- Hey, guys.

20
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,569
And close them, okay?

21
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,536
- Claire, is that your brother?
- Come on!

22
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,289
Oh, yeah.

23
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,209
- Get him.
- You're dead.

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,460
Yeah.

25
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,634
He is so dead.

26
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,305
Max, go away.

27
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,475
- Got him!
- Yeah!

28
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,894
Get him. Come on, come on, come on.

29
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,795
You okay?

30
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,839
Come on, guys. Let's go!

31
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,752
Hey, I'm home.

32
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,715
Hey.

33
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,467
What's wrong?

34
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,603
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo.

35
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,609
She didn't do anything about it.

36
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,904
I'm sorry, honey.

37
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,327
I would have done something about it.

38
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,342
Max, what have you done?

39
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,430
Oh, my God.

40
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,729
No, I don't wanna bother you.
Just...

41
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,023
Just quickly...

42
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,486
...can you tell me exactly what
Mr. Lasseter didn't like about the report?

43
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,199
Well, what am I supposed to do?

44
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,707
No, I'm just tired,
and I've had a rough day here and...

45
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,920
I... I... I cannot afford to lose this.

46
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,552
I know, I know it.

47
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,223
But I better get started because
I'd like to turn it in in the morning.

48
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,893
No, I hear you. I hear you.

49
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,521
And this'll be the last time.
I promise, okay?

50
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,482
Thanks.

51
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,413
Hey.

52
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,500
Hi.

53
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,336
I could use a story.

54
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,926
Sure.

55
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,848
There were some buildings.

56
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,602
There were these really tall buildings...

57
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,103
...and they could walk.

58
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,774
Then there were some vampires.

59
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,444
And one of the vampires
bit the tallest building...

60
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,531
...and his fangs broke off.

61
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,951
Then all his other teeth fell out.

62
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,828
Then he started crying.

63
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,375
And then all the other vampires...

64
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,254
...said, "Why are you crying?

65
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,590
Aren't those just your baby teeth?"

66
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,509
And...

67
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:17,764
And he said, "No.
Those are my grown-up teeth."

68
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:24,271
And the vampires knew that
he couldn't be a vampire anymore...

69
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,106
...so they left him.

70
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,320
The end.

71
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,464
And the sun is the center
of our solar system.

72
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,508
It's the reason
all the planets are here.

73
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,012
Its warmth gives us sunlight,
makes our planet livable.

74
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,806
Of course the sun won't always
be here to keep us warm.

75
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,518
It, like all things, will die.

76
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,104
And when it does, first it expands...

77
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,065
...enveloping all the surrounding
planets, including Earth...

78
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,026
...before consuming them rapidly.

79
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,655
The sun, after all, it's just fuel
burning ferociously.

80
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,451
And when it runs out of fuel,
well, it'll be gone.

81
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:25,040
And, well, after that, the solar
system will go dark permanently.

82
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,834
I mean, I'm sure by that time...

83
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,879
...the human race will have fallen
to any number of calamities:

84
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,131
War, pollution...

85
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,135
...global warming, tsunamis...

86
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,180
...earthquakes, meteors.

87
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,060
But, hey, who knows, right?

88
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,715
Mom!

89
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,592
Mom, come up here.

90
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,427
Max, I'm busy.

91
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,012
I've rebuilt the fort!

92
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,890
You gotta get inside it.
The lava's coming.

93
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:30,355
Oh, and it's a rocket ship,
and it's gonna take off.

94
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,941
Here's looking at you.

95
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,778
Want me to save you a seat?

96
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,280
MAN:
Oh, blessed liege.

97
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,102
You're really...

98
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,437
...nice.
- Cute.

99
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,314
- No, really.
- You're really.

100
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,828
Hi, sweetie.

101
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,830
Claire?

102
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:34,043
It's almost dinner.
Get your stuff off the table, please.

103
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,183
Hey.

104
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,356
Mom, what is that?

105
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,693
Pâté.

106
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,866
Frozen corn.
What's wrong with real corn?

107
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,868
Frozen corn is real, all right?

108
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,747
Get off the chair, please. Tell your
sister to clear her stuff off the table.

109
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:15,376
Claire, get your stuff
off the dining room table!

110
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,049
Max, don't pull that now.

111
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,557
Max, get off the counter, please.
Get off.

112
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,893
I have a friend here.
You're embarrassing me.

113
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,812
Woman, feed me!

114
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,398
Max, get off the co... Get off the counter.

115
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,403
Get off the damn counter, Max.
Now. Now.

116
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,489
- I'll eat you up!
- Get down!

117
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,866
- Ahhh!
- Get off of there.

118
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,409
- Stop!
- Hey.

119
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,744
Get over here.

120
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,414
What is wrong with you?
This is not acceptable behavior.

121
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,208
You're not acceptable!

122
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,545
No dinner for you, Max.
Go to your room.

123
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,757
- Max, you bit me. That hurt!
- Connie, he can't treat you like that.

124
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,426
Max! What is wrong with you?

125
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,637
You're out of control!

126
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,973
It's not my fault!

127
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,773
Max!

128
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,770
I hate you!

129
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,874
Hello?

130
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,165
CAROL: That's it. Tear them all down.
Tear them down.

131
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,423
Come on, we got a few more to go
over here.

132
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,306
Is anyone going to help me?

133
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,143
We like them. They're nice.

134
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,813
I mean, this is a problem.
Don't you see this is a problem?

135
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,107
- I will...
- No, I'll just do it myself.

136
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,151
- Help.
- As usual.

137
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,779
Uh, Carol, could I talk to you
for a second?

138
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,239
No, Douglas, not right now.

139
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,740
- I'm busy.
- Okay.

140
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,659
Maybe they can't hear me from up here.

141
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,411
And I'm the only one
who cares enough to do this.

142
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,623
Or this.

143
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,209
Carol, is this really necessary?

144
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,587
Ask KW. You ask KW if it's necessary.

145
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,339
She's not here. She left.

146
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,758
Aha. She left. She left.

147
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,261
Exactly. That's why it's necessary.

148
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,012
Um, I will help.

149
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,015
Okay. Okay, good. Come on.
Come on, here you go.

150
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,687
- Thank you.
- Glad to help.

151
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,272
Who else wants to lend a hand?

152
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,315
What do you think, Judith? Should I help?

153
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,360
- You shouldn't help him.
- I thought it'd make him feel better.

154
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,446
Good idea. Go stand
in this hut here before it gets wrecked.

155
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,823
I know. I know I shouldn't.

156
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,866
Ira, you're not helping. Go in the hut.

157
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,202
- I'll stand right over here.
- No!

158
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,833
This is crazy!

159
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,376
No, no, it was crazy already.

160
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,378
I'm just eliminating the crazy.

161
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,339
I don't think the crazy's
been eliminated.

162
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,217
Isn't anyone gonna
be on my side anymore?

163
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,219
Yeah, well...

164
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,930
I guess not.

165
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,767
Fine.

166
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,271
I'll just be on my own side...

167
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,024
...by myself.

168
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,533
Nobody cares. I'm the only one
that cares that we don't stay together.

169
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,370
I'm the only one that cares
about that, so...

170
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,914
See? I care.

171
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,583
Carol.

172
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,587
And you don't care, and you stand there
and whisper to each other about me...

173
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,922
...like you always do.
- Yeah, that's true.

174
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,591
But I know what I'm do...

175
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,099
- Ira, what is it?
- I don't know.

176
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,633
Hello.

177
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,792
See?

178
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,086
This guy gets it.

179
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,588
Hey...

180
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,551
...weird little thing. I like the way
you destroy stuff. Good technique.

181
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,011
There's a spark to your work
that can't be taught.

182
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,597
- Thanks.
- All right, you see that one over there?

183
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,433
You get that one, I'll get this one.

184
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,560
- See who can do it faster, okay?
- Okay.

185
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,353
Go!

186
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,085
Hey.

187
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,713
- What are you doing?
- I... I...

188
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,718
- I'm just helping.
- By smashing our houses?

189
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,720
- These are your houses?
- Yeah.

190
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,056
- What's wrong with them?
- What are your houses like?

191
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,727
- I bet his houses are funny-looking.
- Look, we worked very hard on these.

192
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,147
Then you, sir, showed up
and started helping.

193
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,398
- I'm cold.
- Who are you?

194
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,400
Are you one of KW's new friends?

195
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,569
Oh, are you Bob or Terry?

196
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,529
I don't even know who that is.

197
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,990
- Looks like a Bob.
- Things are getting crazy here.

198
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,159
- This thing's dangerous.
- You're scaring me.

199
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,203
You know what I say.
You got a problem...

200
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,288
...eat it.

201
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,790
It's the only way to solve
these types of issues.

202
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,042
Only way.

203
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,085
He's probably got those little bird bones.

204
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,420
I hate those.

205
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,714
You have those bird bones
that are gonna cut my mouth?

206
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,925
- No, I don't have bird bones.
- You better not.

207
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,761
You better not be difficult to eat.
You even think of that?

208
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,346
God, you're selfish.

209
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,057
I hope you don't taste
as selfish as you look.

210
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,808
- Let's eat it.
- Stop.

211
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,439
- Stop!
- Look at him.

212
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,108
He's so delectable and so chewable.

213
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,945
Be still!

214
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:36,992
Why?

215
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,454
Be... Because, well... Well...

216
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,332
Be... Because...

217
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,795
- Why?
- Well, because you can't eat me.

218
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,174
You didn't know that so I forgive you,
but never try again.

219
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,384
Why not?

220
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,137
I... I have powers from another land.

221
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,599
- Powers?
- From ancient times.

222
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,977
Don't make me show you.

223
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,354
I had to show these Vikings once.

224
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,691
- Vikings? What's a Viking?
- Well...

225
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,819
...they wear horned hats,
and they're big.

226
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,321
Bigger than all of you.

227
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,700
One time they attacked me
in my ice fortress.

228
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,579
They tried to cave in the roof,
but I had made it too strong.

229
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,999
I told them to be still, but they didn't.

230
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,500
I conquered them.

231
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,837
- I had to make their heads explode.
- What?

232
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,841
And then they realized that I knew
all the secrets to the world.

233
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,011
And then you know what happened?

234
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,183
They made me their king.

235
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,519
- King?
- You were a king?

236
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,856
I knew there was something special
about him. I told you guys.

237
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,442
So, wait, you exploded their heads?

238
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,362
Oh, come on. Our heads are bigger.
You can't explode big heads.

239
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,115
No, their heads were bigger
than yours, believe me.

240
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,200
But you're so small.

241
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,371
Small is good. My powers are able to
slip right through the cracks.

242
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,957
But what if the cracks are closed up?

243
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,209
I have a re-cracker,
which goes through that.

244
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,254
What if they have some material
re-crackers can't get through?

245
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,175
Then I have a double re-cracker, which can
get through anything in this universe.

246
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,387
And that's the end, and there's nothing
more powerful after that, ever. Period.

247
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,057
- He has a double re-cracker.
- He does sound powerful.

248
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,601
Yeah, but there has to be
some material somewhere...

249
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,227
...maybe deep underground.

250
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,731
- If we combined it with something...
- Quiet. Be quiet.

251
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,651
I'm sorry. So...

252
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,571
...you were their king,
and you made everything right?

253
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,574
Yeah.

254
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,578
Well, you know, what about loneliness?

255
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,999
What he's saying is,
will you keep out all the sadness?

256
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,304
I have a sadness shield
that keeps out all the sadness.

257
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,264
And it's big enough for all of us.

258
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,894
And I do this to loneliness.

259
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,942
I knew it, I knew it.
When he showed up, I saw it.

260
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,944
Why don't you guys ever listen to me?

261
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,239
You're right, Carol. I didn't see it.

262
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,283
I don't understand.
He doesn't look like a king.

263
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,786
If he could be king, I could be king.

264
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,996
Were you the king where you came from?

265
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,290
Yeah. Yeah, for 20 years.

266
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,752
- That's impressive.
- That's incredible, right?

267
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,589
Wow. Looks like we found our king.

268
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,675
You are our king, right?

269
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,385
Yeah.

270
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah, I am.

271
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,099
- I'm so relieved.
- Sorry we were gonna eat you.

272
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,017
- We didn't know you were king.
- Insane.

273
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,061
- Yeah, I mean...
- Oh, my God, it's KW.

274
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,271
- What?
- What?

275
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,482
- Oh, hi, KW.
- KW, good to see you.

276
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,485
I thought you were with
your new best friends, Bob and Terry.

277
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,279
What are you guys doing?

278
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,489
- Who is that?
- KW, get in here.

279
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,658
You gotta hear this. We finally got a king.

280
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,493
- That's true.
- A very impressive one.

281
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,995
Yeah, KW, we got a king.

282
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,415
You and me could go for a walk,
and I'll tell you about it. Anytime.

283
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,501
You could carry me like a little baby.

284
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,422
Yeah, anyway,
I don't know if I'm sticking around.

285
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,591
I just came back...

286
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,012
...to get that one stick that I left here.
Did anyone see it?

287
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,848
I'll help find it, KW.
I'm good at finding sticks.

288
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,434
KW, he's very powerful.

289
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,437
Stop, stop. Don't push her.
She'll figure it out for herself.

290
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,397
Just leave her be, okay?

291
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,693
King. King, this way.
Your Majesty, please.

292
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,367
Oh, look. He's gonna
make us happy, Judy.

293
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,660
Yeah.

294
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,622
But happiness isn't always
the best way to be happy.

295
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,540
Judith, stop.

296
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,875
He's small for a king.

297
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,169
- Am I nuts? He's small.
- That's what I said.

298
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,296
- Alexander.
- Sorry.

299
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,391
I like it better when we have a king.

300
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,813
I like Carol better
when we have a king.

301
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,607
Hey, what happened to our houses?

302
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,194
They fell down.

303
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,332
Are those other kings?

304
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,877
They were there before we got here.

305
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,256
I never saw them.
I never even noticed them.

306
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,931
You okay?

307
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,725
Yeah.

308
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,817
You are now the king.

309
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,028
And you will be a truly great king.

310
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,781
Look at it.
It looks good on him, look.

311
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,283
He looks great. Our king!

312
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,159
- You look perfect.
- It looks perfect.

313
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,537
- We have a king.
- Fresh king.

314
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,414
- Finally.
- A king!

315
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,748
I know this part.

316
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,125
King, king, king...

317
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,628
Hey, king, what's
your first order of business?

318
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,592
Let the wild rumpus start!

319
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,137
Perfect answer!

320
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,639
You hear that?

321
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,808
Rumpus!

322
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,145
Come on. Come on, king.

323
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,570
Come on, KW, get in.

324
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,079
Rumpus!

325
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,087
Guys! Follow me.

326
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,917
What?

327
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,588
You're funny-looking. That's all.

328
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,805
Hey, king, king, king, watch this.

329
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,771
Hey.

330
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,107
Hey, jumping guy!

331
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,151
Jumping guy!

332
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,236
Hey, mister!

333
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,448
Wait up!

334
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,621
Hey, jumping guy! Hey!

335
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,124
Hey, king, watch this.

336
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,220
All right, tree, we'll settle this later.

337
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,016
Oh, look, everyone wants to be friends
with the new guy.

338
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,645
Well, this is our family. I hope you can see
how excited they are to have a king.

339
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,647
They have an odd way of showing it.

340
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:32,986
I mean, they act weird, you know,
and can hurt other people's feelings.

341
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,529
- Ira, my love?
- What?

342
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,864
- Come here.
- Okay.

343
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,491
Oh, that's Judith and Ira.

344
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,117
They're in love.

345
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,954
Hey.

346
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,664
What are you thinking?

347
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,544
Watch me. Look.

348
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,088
That's Alexander.

349
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,716
Look, I hate this tree! Ow.

350
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,803
He just wants attention.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

351
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,012
Seventy-seven.

352
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,641
Seventy-eight. No, wait.
No, no. What was that?

353
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,351
- That's Douglas.
- That was 76.

354
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,520
- I count on him for everything.
- Well...

355
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,523
If I was stranded on an island
and I could only take one thing...

356
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,732
...it'd be Douglas.

357
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,901
- We can share him if you want.
- That's good.

358
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,569
I might need one of those.

359
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,197
Douglas, no. No, no, no, stop.

360
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,741
That's not the way I want you
to do it. Here, I'll show you.

361
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,993
- Whoa!
- How did that happen?

362
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,330
It was an accident.
I don't know how that happened.

363
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,624
We haven't formally met.

364
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,209
I'm Ira.

365
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,837
I put the holes in the trees.
Maybe you saw those?

366
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,590
- Come here.
- Or maybe not.

367
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,467
Anyways, it's what I do.

368
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,763
It's not really important,
like the things that you do.

369
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,516
Oh, and this is Judith.

370
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,060
You don't really need to know me.
I'm kind of a downer.

371
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,771
King, that's not true.

372
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,066
- Hey, let me see your face.
- You could introduce me if you want.

373
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,068
Here, let me see your face.

374
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,738
What's that? Don't worry. Let me see it.

375
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,297
Good shot, Douglas.

376
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,882
Almost got me.

377
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,592
Almost not good enough.

378
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,385
We'll get him next time, won't we?

379
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,053
Yes. Oh, yes.

380
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,973
We will. We will.

381
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,602
Hey, what you doing?

382
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,733
Is she the one you were mad at
when you were smashing stuff?

383
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,652
Yeah. No, no.

384
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,571
No, it...

385
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,699
I thought she said
she wasn't gonna come back.

386
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,620
- Well, it looks like she's back now.
- Yeah.

387
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,456
Yeah, I hope so.

388
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,166
I'm gonna get her.

389
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,128
No, don't, don't! She doesn't like
that kind of thing. Come back!

390
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,923
- Ira, my love, come here.
- Hey, king, watch this.

391
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,926
King, I wouldn't recommend that.

392
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,014
Stop it.

393
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,476
Okay, stop it.

394
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,645
Go pick someone else's nose!

395
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,148
Max, look out.

396
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,775
Gotcha.

397
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,534
Alexander, get over there
and be social.

398
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,165
Let's be like this forever!

399
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,961
You guys never think this is me,
but this is really me.

400
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,172
He's starting things off right,
our king.

401
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,508
- Wow, this guy gets things done.
- That was...

402
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,344
- That was great.
- Yeah, that was great.

403
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,638
That was fun.
We forgot how to have fun.

404
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,931
That's true, Carol.

405
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,350
- I mean, I didn't, but...
- No, you didn't, Carol.

406
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,559
KW, your toe's in my ear.

407
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,436
Good, you're keeping it warm.

408
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,146
- Hey, who's on my face?
- Stop.

409
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,524
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol. It is you.
Oh, let me move.

410
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,861
Oh, I like this.
Let's be like this forever.

411
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,738
King having a problem?

412
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,032
My foot's stuck under this fat guy.

413
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,370
There.

414
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,539
- Thanks.
- I'm KW.

415
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,251
- I'm Max.
- I know.

416
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,046
Hey, so are you gonna stay?

417
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,049
- Well...
- They all want you to.

418
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:27,929
It's complicated. I don't even know
how everything got this way.

419
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,056
Things seem better now, though.

420
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,976
Yeah, well, they are.

421
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,729
Okay, king.

422
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,398
Hey, who are Bob and Terry?

423
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,276
Oh, they're really good friends of mine.

424
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,403
I don't even know how to describe them.

425
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,115
They're just different
from everybody here.

426
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,700
It's just different.

427
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,413
- Well, do you like them more than...?
- You ask a lot of questions.

428
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,042
So, what's your story?
Why'd you come here?

429
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,835
Well...

430
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,589
Well, I'm an explorer, and I travel a lot.

431
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,591
- And I travel by sea.
- Right.

432
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,134
I used to travel by air.

433
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,179
So obviously you have
no home or family.

434
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,600
I had one of those, but...

435
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,811
- But you ate them all?
- No.

436
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,273
No, I just bit one of them,
that's all, and...

437
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,817
...they went crazy.

438
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,446
And...

439
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,034
...I don't like frozen corn.

440
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,411
I'm sorry.

441
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,288
That's why you left?

442
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,126
They act like I'm a bad person.

443
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,087
Well, are you?

444
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:47,300
I don't know.

445
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,013
Well, I'm glad you came.

446
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,849
It'll be good to have someone around
who doesn't eat everybody.

447
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,768
I mean, you just bite everyone.

448
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,313
But biters aren't so bad.
Eaters are the ones I just can't stand.

449
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,024
I have no plans to eat anybody.

450
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,152
All right. Good.

451
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,364
Well, good night.

452
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,540
Good night, KW.

453
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,750
- Good night.
- Good night, Ira.

454
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,420
- Night.
- Good night, Douglas.

455
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,548
- Good night, Carol.
- Good night, Judith.

456
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,634
- Good night.
- Good night, Judy.

457
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,344
Good night, darling.

458
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,513
Good night.
Night, Alex.

459
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,181
- Good night, king.
- Night.

460
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,601
- Oh, good night, king.
- Yeah, good night, king.

461
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,521
Boy, this is nice.

462
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,566
Good night, everybody.

463
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,402
Everybody, sweet dreams.

464
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,185
I didn't wanna wake you up...

465
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,562
...but I really wanna show you
something.

466
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,566
- Okay.
- And on our way...

467
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,737
...I can show you your kingdom.
This is all yours.

468
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,406
You're the owner of this world.

469
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,950
Everything you see is yours.

470
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,913
Oh, except that hole over there,
that's Ira's.

471
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,791
The tree's yours, but the hole is Ira's.
But everything else is yours.

472
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:48,087
Except for that rock over there, that's not
yours. That little rock next to the big rock.

473
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,048
But everything else in the kingdom...

474
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,676
...except for that stick. That little
stick right there, that's not yours.

475
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,974
I want you to be king forever, Max.

476
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,853
Yeah. Definitely.

477
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,776
Well...

478
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,737
...this part of your kingdom's
not so good.

479
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,239
Why?

480
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:17,867
Well, look. This used to be all rock,
and now it's sand.

481
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,622
And then one day it's gonna be dust. And
then the whole island will be dust and...

482
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,085
And then I don't even know
what comes after dust.

483
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,926
Carol?

484
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,595
Did you know the sun was gonna die?

485
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,722
What?

486
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,937
I never heard that.

487
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,985
Oh, come on.

488
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,946
That can't happen.

489
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,826
I mean, you're the king,
and look at me. I'm big.

490
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:07,500
How could guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun? Hm?

491
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,890
Carol, what's that?

492
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,184
Oh, it's that dog.

493
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,521
Don't feed it, it'll just follow you around.

494
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,700
Carol, wait up for me.

495
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,096
Did you make this?

496
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,682
Yeah, yeah.

497
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,685
It's very good.

498
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,859
We were gonna make
a whole world like this, but...

499
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,445
Everyone used to come here...

500
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,365
...but, you know...

501
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,829
You know what it feels like when all
your teeth are falling out really slowly...

502
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,665
...and you don't realize...

503
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,336
...and then you notice that,
well, they're really far apart?

504
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,465
And then one day...

505
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,970
...you don't have any teeth anymore.

506
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,140
Yeah.

507
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,934
Well, it was like that.

508
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,564
All right, put your head right here.

509
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,441
Right here.

510
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,496
All right, now watch.

511
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,684
Wow. I wish I could live in there.

512
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,020
Yeah.

513
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:19,025
It was gonna be a place where only
the things you wanted to have happen...

514
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,526
...would happen.

515
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,737
Yeah.

516
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,949
I guess if that's not gonna happen,
I'll just probably end up eating my feet off.

517
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,628
Carol, we can totally build a place
like that.

518
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,633
- Really?
- We're gonna start with the perfect fort.

519
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,302
And then we're gonna
build the city around it...

520
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,137
...because we've gotta be realistic.

521
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,723
I mean, we need to start with
the perfect fort...

522
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,892
...then we'll build
the underground complex...

523
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,769
...that's gonna tie everything together.

524
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,939
I like your brain, Max.

525
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,526
Hey! I'm not gonna
eat my feet off anymore.

526
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,320
- Well, why?
- Max is gonna build a fortress.

527
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,907
Yeah, it's gonna be as tall as
12 of you and six of me.

528
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,077
And only we can get in.
We can have an ice cream parlor.

529
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,538
A swimming pool with a bottom
that's a trampoline.

530
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,873
Hey, where were you?
We were just here.

531
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,710
And anyone who gets in that we don't
want there will get their brains cut out.

532
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:23,339
- The building will do it automatically.
- How's it know which brains to cut?

533
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,844
Okay, so there will be a tree,
but it's a fake tree with a tunnel.

534
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,895
So anyways, it's not a tree,
it's a tunnel.

535
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,107
And it'll lead you into the fort
through a compartment.

536
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,944
Ira, do you wanna be in charge of
the tunnels because you make great holes?

537
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,448
- I don't want my brains cut out.
- This fort is already making me happy.

538
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,783
Does anybody ever hear me?

539
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,121
We'll take care of each other,
and we'll all sleep together in a real pile.

540
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,999
- What do you think?
- I don't think anything like this...

541
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,710
...ever works, really. If it did...

542
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,129
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know anything.

543
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,548
- But I do like sleeping in a real pile.
- Carol...

544
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,800
...will you be in charge of building it?

545
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,638
You should definitely be in charge.
You're the only one who can pull it off.

546
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,433
Yeah, well, you're right, but...

547
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,686
KW, don't you think
that Carol should build it?

548
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,273
Yeah. He's the only one who can.

549
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,941
I'll build it if he doesn't wanna.

550
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,361
You really wanna do this?

551
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,780
- Oh, yeah.
- I think it's a perfect idea.

552
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,742
Well, all right. If you wanna do it...

553
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,870
...and you want me...

554
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,247
...I'd be honored.

555
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,500
- Judy, you would have been good too.
- Yeah.

556
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,924
How about a window here?
We'll put it here.

557
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,636
We'll put the doorway over here.
And your room'll be here.

558
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,147
Just a little more that way.
A little more. Yeah, right there.

559
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,242
Yeah!

560
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,420
- How about here? You like it here?
- We have to mark there...

561
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,715
...one mark there, and then
we can have the other mark over there.

562
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,051
Yeah. A little more this way.

563
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,136
Oh, that's five, Carol.

564
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,722
Seven Douglases across,
we'll have the other mark.

565
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,557
- What have you been eating?
- Rocks.

566
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,851
Rocks. What did I tell you
about eating rocks?

567
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,562
- That's six.
- You're getting a little paunch.

568
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,399
- Hey, KW.
- Hey, king.

569
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,901
- How about here?
- We need seven Douglases.

570
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,361
No more and no less.

571
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,406
- Seven chubby Douglases.
- Hey, Carol.

572
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:57,910
It's gonna be part castle, part fort,
part mountain and part ship.

573
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:02,915
We'll have a laboratory where we
can build robots to do stuff for us...

574
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,210
...our own detective agency...

575
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,461
...and our own language.

576
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,881
And we'll make a machine
that can take our legs off...

577
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,591
...and that way, we can float.

578
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,138
All right, Carol!

579
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,390
You smiled.

580
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,600
You can't deny that
this was a good idea.

581
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,935
I didn't deny it.

582
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,314
I believe part of that idea was mine.

583
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,942
What part?

584
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,069
The part where I said,
"Yeah, good idea."

585
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,754
I got it.

586
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,630
Got it.

587
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,968
Judith, that tickles. Ha-ha.

588
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,270
I like the tunnel, Ira.

589
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,272
- Oh.
- Impressive.

590
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,232
Why, thank you, king.

591
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,489
Great beams, Douglas. Strong.

592
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,994
Thanks.
Just the standard beams I always do.

593
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,725
What were you doing with Carol
just now?

594
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,561
Just talking.

595
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,980
Oh, a secret, huh?

596
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,732
Let me ask you something.
How does it work around here?

597
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,735
Are we all the same
or are some of us better than others or...?

598
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,780
You like to play favorites,
huh, king? Ow.

599
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,408
No, I like all you guys equally.

600
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,411
Don't give me that.
I can see how it is.

601
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,913
The king has favorites.
That's really cute.

602
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,749
Ow! Stop! Do you have a favorite color?

603
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,793
Hey, can I be your favorite color?

604
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,066
You know what?

605
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,319
You can't do that back to me.

606
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,239
If we're upset, your job is
not to get upset back at us.

607
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,201
Our job is to be upset.

608
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,870
If I get mad and wanna eat you,
then you have to say:

609
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,581
"Oh, okay. You can eat me.

610
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,792
I love you.
Whatever makes you happy, Judith."

611
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,003
That's what you're supposed to do!

612
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,508
Come on, Max,
let's go get those sticks.

613
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,928
Yeah. Okay.

614
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,304
I hope you heard me, king.

615
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,515
- Ow!
- Yeah, he heard you, Judith.

616
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,976
Everyone always hears you.

617
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,147
You think you have power, KW?

618
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,650
That's not real power.

619
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,028
I'm talking to you!

620
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,488
No! Not you.

621
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,782
I'm still talking to KW.

622
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,958
Don't worry about Judith. She's...

623
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,793
...a downer.

624
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,671
No, you'll figure it out.

625
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:23,092
Hey, you should talk to Bob and Terry
about it. Come on.

626
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,761
King.

627
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,852
Seriously, they're really smart.

628
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,896
They have the answers to everything.

629
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,924
Hold on, hold on.

630
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,718
I'm coming.

631
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,770
Well, what do you think?

632
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,443
This is Bob and Terry.

633
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,989
They love it when I do this to them.

634
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,618
Bob, Terry, this is Max.

635
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,828
He's the biter I was telling you about.

636
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,375
Say hi.

637
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,001
Hi.

638
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,630
He wanted to ask you guys some advice.

639
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:30,219
Go ahead. They're not judgmental.

640
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,972
- You mean just ask them?
- Yeah.

641
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:40,104
They say it's better for you if you
can ask the question in seven words.

642
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,859
Um... Okay.

643
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,077
How...

644
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,162
...do...

645
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,958
...I make...

646
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,877
...everyone...

647
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,508
...okay?

648
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,013
Oh, yeah. I didn't think of that.

649
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,518
Wow, they really get to
the heart of it, don't they?

650
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,271
Aren't they great?

651
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,648
What if they came and lived with us?

652
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,694
Bob, Terry, why don't you come live
with us? We're building something great.

653
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,990
Oh, good. Right, Max?

654
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:38,662
Well, what about Carol?

655
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,914
He's Carol.

656
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,711
I can like him and still be friends
with Bob and Terry.

657
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,234
Hey, Douglas!

658
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,862
Hey! Where's Carol?

659
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,655
He's in the fort!

660
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,159
Aft section, main chamber.

661
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,421
Carol! Carol! The fort looks great.

662
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:34,009
Yeah. Thanks. We're all working
really hard on it. Where you been?

663
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:38,222
Well, KW took me to see her friends,
Bob and Terry.

664
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,558
They really wanna meet you.
They may even stay over.

665
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,234
Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?

666
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,278
- What? KW told you about me?
- Hi, guys.

667
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,530
What'd she say?

668
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,660
Oh, precious little
Bob and Terry get carried.

669
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,788
Excuse me... My voice?

670
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,792
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, sometimes I...

671
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,924
I know, I know. I am a very lucky man.

672
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,135
Hey, hey, do you guys know any jokes?

673
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,640
Who's there?

674
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,101
Loud interrupting cow...

675
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,397
That's hilarious.

676
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,440
They're amazing, KW.

677
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,277
Max, what's wrong with the fort?

678
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:36,572
- I thought you said it'd be automatic.
- What?

679
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,908
Well, I thought you said if anybody
got in here we didn't want...

680
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,494
...the fort would automatically
cut their brains out.

681
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,956
- Carol.
- Oh, well...

682
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,209
...I thought that then, but...

683
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,754
...I kind of decided
that if we know them...

684
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,173
...they should keep their brains.

685
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,179
Even if we don't know them that well.

686
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,101
I think you should apologize
to Bob and Terry.

687
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,604
I don't apologize to owls.

688
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,439
Owls are stupid.

689
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,774
Carol, that's hateful.

690
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,110
Why would you bring them here?

691
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,032
Huh? This place was supposed to be for us.

692
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,910
They are not sleeping in our pile.

693
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,045
Gee, you're the best king ever.

694
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,672
You've changed everything.

695
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,198
Hey, Carol.

696
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,786
I don't get why she likes them
so much.

697
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,665
And I couldn't even understand
what they were saying.

698
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,292
All I heard was squeaking.

699
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,716
I couldn't really understand
what they were saying either.

700
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,511
- Really?
- Yeah.

701
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,429
/CHUCKLES/

702
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,185
Everybody's mad at me.

703
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:40,445
Is there anything you can do to,
you know...?

704
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,620
There's something I like to do
that sometimes makes me feel better.

705
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,748
What is it?

706
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,835
Okay, we're gonna have a war.

707
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,838
And we're gonna completely clobber
each other.

708
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,465
Clobber each other?

709
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,884
Yeah, with huge dirt clods.

710
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,762
I used to do it a ton
when I was a little kid.

711
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,849
Yep, we've not had a dirt-clod fight
in a long time.

712
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,101
Yeah. It's the best way
to have fun together.

713
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,479
Yeah, life was simpler back then
with the dirt clods.

714
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,399
- Yeah.
- So who wants to be a bad guy?

715
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,739
Okay. I'll pick one, then.

716
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,993
- Okay, you're a bad guy.
- Yeah, I saw that coming.

717
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,163
And then you're definitely a bad guy.

718
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,332
- What? Damn.
- And you can pick one other.

719
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,294
- I'll be bad. Really.
- Okay, we pick you.

720
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:41,757
No. No, I can't be a bad guy.
I'm the king. I'm a good guy.

721
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,343
- I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. A bad guy.
- Okay, you can be a bad guy.

722
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,596
- Judy, I'm with you.
- Yeah, I heard.

723
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,805
And you...

724
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,019
- He's with you.
- Am I a good guy?

725
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,022
Yes, of course. You have the best arm.

726
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,690
Hey, where were you?

727
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,693
I was just making sure Bob and Terry
still have their brains.

728
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,695
- KW!
- They do.

729
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,532
Hey, KW, you wanna be on my team?
We're the bad guys.

730
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,660
No! No, no. No, you're with us.
You're a good guy.

731
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,706
Yeah, come on, KW, be a good guy.

732
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,209
Okay, so you're on my team.

733
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,045
You and me and Carol.

734
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,422
Hi, KW.

735
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,512
So, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna try to kill the bad guys...

736
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,807
...by beaning them in the head
with these dirt clods.

737
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,976
We're gonna try to find
the biggest pieces...

738
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,562
- Whoa!
- Ha-ha! You didn't see that coming!

739
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,981
- Run for cover!
- Run!

740
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,358
You'd better run.

741
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,362
Hey, wait. You didn't make
the official starting noise.

742
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,905
Sorry.

743
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,115
Run! Come on!

744
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,417
Look out for the bad guys.

745
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,133
We got them pinned down.
They can't even move.

746
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,845
- Fire on three!
- Okay.

747
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,306
One, two, three!

748
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,141
You guys are gonna...

749
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,486
Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea.

750
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,738
Come out!

751
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,533
No!

752
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,618
Why not?

753
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,997
Uh, because you're gonna hit us
in the head with dirt.

754
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,834
Come out!

755
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,253
No!

756
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,088
Why not?

757
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,508
When I said you were gonna hit us
in the head, you didn't say anything!

758
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,220
That means you're planning
to hit us in the head with dirt!

759
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,767
- Man, they really have us figured out.
- Yeah.

760
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,980
Okay. Let's go!

761
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,690
Charge!

762
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,028
Ira! Get Carol.

763
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,407
Good shot. I'm gonna get you!

764
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,339
Hey. Who threw Richard?

765
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,716
Well, he's on our team now.

766
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,472
- Gotcha.
- No animals!

767
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,849
It really hurts! It's hurting!

768
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,028
- Hey, Douglas. Get the goat.
- Okay.

769
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,405
- Knock his legs out.
- Got it.

770
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,535
That's cheating!
I'm not gonna play anymore!

771
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,788
- Alexander, come on. Fight with us.
- Do it again.

772
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:07,045
- That's... That's not fair! Are you crazy?
- You're supposed to get hit. It's a war.

773
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,714
That wasn't fair. Douglas hit me
when I was hurt.

774
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,550
You can't hit someone
when they're hurt. I quit.

775
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,219
Get back in here, right now.

776
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,681
- Alex, count to 10. Things will get better.
- Alexander, don't you cry!

777
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,724
If I count to 10, will you be gone, Ira?

778
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,560
- Don't you dare talk to Ira the way I do.
- Knock it off!

779
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,564
- Ow! That's my eye.
- Run! Come on.

780
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,857
Look out! Run.

781
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,585
Oh, Carol. I'm sorry.

782
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,842
What happened?
Somebody step on your head?

783
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,094
What are you doing?

784
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,722
- What?
- Don't step on my head.

785
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,767
What do you mean? It's a war.
Douglas just did it.

786
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:06,021
Yeah, but he did it by accident,
you did it on purpose.

787
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,025
And he didn't step on
the face part of my head.

788
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,111
It was a joke.

789
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,988
I was just joking.

790
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,531
Sure you were.

791
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,910
Like you aren't always looking for
the opportunity to step on my head.

792
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,246
Because that's what you do.

793
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,626
Fine. Fine. You know what?

794
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:32,505
This is exactly why I don't ever wanna
do anything with you anymore.

795
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,632
Go ahead.

796
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,760
Step on my head.

797
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:42,223
No, forget it. I'm not gonna step on
your head just to make you feel better.

798
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,062
Let's go, Douglas.

799
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,981
Carol, I think you did the right thing.

800
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,776
You know, not stepping on her head.

801
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,466
Thanks, Max.

802
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,843
But I'm done.

803
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,430
I don't know why I came back here.

804
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,850
I'm glad I met you, I guess.

805
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,491
So, king, what's going on?

806
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,327
This is how you rule a kingdom?
Everyone fighting?

807
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,206
The bad guys feel bad.
Hell, everyone feels bad.

808
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,628
Yeah, I'm still sort of dizzy.
My eyeballs feel loose.

809
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,881
Can it, Ira.
Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.

810
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,383
No.

811
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,887
Max'll bring KW back.

812
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,056
He'll keep us all together.

813
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,268
He has powers. He told us.

814
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,686
Right, Max?

815
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,564
Show us.

816
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:43,803
Uh-oh. Somebody broke the king.

817
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:48,641
I don't get it. Oh, wait, I do.
It's stupid.

818
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,480
I think he's done now.

819
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,775
That's what we waited for?

820
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,657
Carol?

821
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,069
Hi.

822
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:45,568
- Is that from the dirt clods?
- Yeah.

823
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:49,322
It's from when you had Douglas hit me.

824
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,577
I'm sorry about that.

825
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,833
It's okay.

826
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,090
No one really listens to you, huh?

827
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,966
Oh, you've noticed.

828
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:15,765
Yeah, I guess you're not used to that,
being a king and all.

829
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,984
I really messed this place up.

830
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:37,203
You're not really a king, huh?

831
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,998
You're just regular.

832
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,380
I knew it.

833
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,175
I don't even know
if there is such a thing...

834
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:56,055
...as a king who can do
all the things you said.

835
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,644
Look, I don't care.

836
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,856
Just don't ever let Carol find out.

837
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,076
He's a terrible king.

838
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,540
Where is he from?

839
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,375
Where does he go?

840
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,045
Why isn't he helping us?

841
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,386
I wanna eat them up.

842
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,450
Hey, Max...

843
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,453
...what's that?

844
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:04,248
Well, I was thinking we needed
a place...

845
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,751
...where the king is secret.

846
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,420
Like a secret chamber for the king.

847
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,673
Well, I don't understand. What...?

848
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,177
Well, you know, like a small place...

849
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,180
...with a door that's not so big.

850
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,432
I don't know.

851
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,769
I didn't picture it with secret doors.

852
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:33,528
What if it were a big place
with big secret doors?

853
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,699
That... That's not really
how it would be done.

854
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,869
It's more like... It's like a...

855
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:49,919
About that big?

856
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,558
Everybody get out here.

857
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,978
Wake up.

858
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,605
Everybody wake up!

859
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,149
All right, get out here!

860
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,610
JUDITH:
Ira, what is that?

861
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,654
- Everybody, wake up.
- It's Carol.

862
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,156
I knew it was gonna happen.

863
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:20,491
Judy, Judy.

864
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,869
It's all wrong.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

865
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,080
Judith, what's happening right now?

866
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,290
Judith?

867
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,833
Wake up and come out here.

868
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,501
- What is it?
- What's he saying?

869
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,044
Get out here!

870
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,255
- What's he talking about?
- It's wrong.

871
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,840
I can't even look at it.

872
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,466
- What is it?
- The fort.

873
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,760
- We gotta tear the fort down.
- What?

874
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,346
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
- No, Carol.

875
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,182
You said we were all gonna sleep
together in a real pile.

876
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,435
And now you want a secret room.

877
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,978
And KW's gone for good.

878
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,689
Now I have to worry if the sun
is gonna die. Look at it.

879
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,482
It didn't come up. It's dead.

880
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,692
- What?
- It's dark.

881
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,901
- Oh, my God.
- Dead?

882
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,903
- Carol, stop!
- It's dead. It's dead.

883
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:00,239
- You're scaring everybody.
- It's morning.

884
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,491
The sun's not dead,
it's just nighttime.

885
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,202
How do you know?
I can't trust what you say.

886
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:09,123
Everything keeps changing. All right,
come on, we're ripping it down.

887
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,292
Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!

888
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,171
It was supposed to be where only things
you wanted to happen would happen.

889
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,006
Come on, Douglas,
do what I tell you.

890
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:20,593
No! We all live here, not just you.

891
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:24,055
It... It's everybody's.
Judith and Ira and everybody.

892
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,807
- Oh, finally.
- You were supposed to keep us safe...

893
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,893
...and take care of us, and you didn't.

894
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,269
- Carol.
- I'm sorry!

895
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,229
- That's not good enough.
- Carol.

896
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,065
You're a terrible king.

897
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,441
- Carol!
- What?

898
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,737
- He's not our king.
- What?

899
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,783
Don't say that. How could you say that?
Don't you dare say that.

900
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,661
There's no such thing as a king.

901
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,079
Don't you say that.

902
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:53,334
He's just a boy pretending to be a wolf
pretending to be a king.

903
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,669
That's not true.

904
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,713
- He's just like us.
- Oh, why don't I listen to myself?

905
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:58,923
That's not true!

906
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,385
Look, I just went along with it
because I knew you wanted it so much.

907
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,054
- Don't say that!
- Don't! Carol, stop it!

908
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,932
- Oh, no!
- Stop it, what are you doing?

909
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,225
- Carol!
- What?

910
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,268
That was my favorite arm.

911
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,854
CAROL: Well, I was just holding onto it.
You pulled away.

912
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,064
- What?
- Carol, stop it!

913
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,316
- You lied?
- You're out of control!

914
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,110
I'm not out of control.

915
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:21,821
You were supposed to take care of us.
You promised!

916
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,948
I'll eat you up!

917
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,718
Come back here!

918
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:52,435
Max!

919
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,315
Come on. Come here.

920
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,655
Get in. Get inside.

921
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,826
Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
I'll hide you.

922
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,801
Hi, Richard.

923
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,181
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

924
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:31,515
- : Where?
- I don't know!

925
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,184
I can smell him!

926
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,105
- I just wanna talk to him.
- You're out of control!

927
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,565
I'm not out of control!

928
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:40,941
You were gonna eat him.

929
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,028
No, no. I was... I wasn't gonna...

930
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:47,198
I don't know, I just said it!

931
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,456
Am I as bad as he says I am?

932
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,626
Just go away.

933
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,797
I just wanted us all to be together.

934
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:23,025
Can you believe him?

935
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,741
He doesn't mean to be that way, KW.

936
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,456
He's just scared.

937
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,506
Well, he only makes it harder.

938
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,926
And it's hard enough already.

939
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,561
And he loves you. You're his family.

940
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,690
Yeah.

941
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,360
It's hard being a family.

942
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:19,164
I can't breathe that well in here.
Can you get me out?

943
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,164
I wish you guys had a mom.

944
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,466
I'm gonna go home.

945
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:36,700
Carol!

946
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,399
Max.

947
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,908
Well...

948
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:05,122
Yeah.

949
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,262
So, what ever happened
with you and the Vikings?

950
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,516
Well, in the end...

951
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,977
...I had to leave.

952
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,437
Why?

953
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,110
I'm not a Viking or a king...

954
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,447
...or anything.

955
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,534
So, what are you?

956
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,836
I'm Max.

957
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,758
Well...

958
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,761
...that's not very much, is it?

959
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,337
Hey, Max?

960
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,549
Yeah?

961
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,301
When you go home...

962
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,720
...will you say good things about us?

963
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,432
Yeah. I will.

964
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,439
Thanks, Max.

965
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,010
You're the first king
we haven't eaten.

966
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,179
Yeah, it's true.

967
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,060
See you.

968
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:33,937
Bye, Max.

969
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,606
Bye.

970
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,059
Don't go.

971
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,438
I'll eat you up, I love you so.
