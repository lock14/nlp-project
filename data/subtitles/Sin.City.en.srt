34
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,477
<font color="#bafbfe">Take a deep breath, Hartigan.</font>

35
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:47,296
<font color="#bafbfe">Settle down and think straight.</font>

36
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:51,484
<font color="#bafbfe">You're pushing 60

<font color="#bafbfe">Heck, Bob...</font>

43
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,473
<font color="#bafbfe">maybe you are right.</font>

44
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,127
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm glad to hear you're finally talking sense.</font>

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,521
<font color="#bafbfe">You've been very quiet.</font>

51
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,688
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't be scared.</font>

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,383

maybe soon.</font>

53
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,033

62
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:14,524
<font color="#bafbfe">You would risk engender-ating ill

<font color="#bafbfe">All we're gonna do is have
a nice little talk.</font>

<font color="#bafbfe">We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.</font>

146
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,579
<font color="#bafbfe">Sit down or I'll blast you in half.</font>

147
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,909
<font color="#bafbfe">So slow, never stop me.
Sit down!</font>

148
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,911
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll never be able to stop me.</font>

149
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,540
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I finally sit down,</i></font>

150
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,454
<font color="#ffff00"><i>just like you told me to.</i></font>

151
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,954
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The sirens are close now.</i></font>

152
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:55,355
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She'll be safe.</i></font>

153
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,071
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Things go dark.</i></font>

154
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,988
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't mind much.</i></font>

155
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,067
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Getting sleepy.</i></font>

156
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,990
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's OK.</i></font>

157
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,024
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She'll be safe.</i></font>

158
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,627
<font color="#ffff00"><i>An old man dies,</i></font>

159
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,997
<font color="#ffff00"><i>a little girl lives.</i></font>

160
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,497
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Fair trade.</i></font>

161
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,789
<font color="#bafbfe">Just tell me it isn't true, John.</font>

162
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:49,302
<font color="#bafbfe">What they're saying
about you and that child.</font>

163
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,754
<font color="#bafbfe">It can't be true.</font>

164
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,155
<font color="#bafbfe">If you ever want to see me again...</font>

165
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,211
<font color="#bafbfe">say something now.</font>

166
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:08,753
<font color="#bafbfe">We're looking at your basic
mountain of DNA evidence.</font>

167
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,081
<font color="#bafbfe">The testimony of your own partner,</font>

168
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:14,801
<font color="#bafbfe">corroboration by six eyewitnesses,
and that's just so far</font>

169
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,503
<font color="#bafbfe">and there's your own silence.</font>

170
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,224
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll do what I can, but let us
just say you are good and screwed.</font>

171
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,620
<font color="#bafbfe">Come on, Hartigan,</font>

172
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,161
<font color="#bafbfe">what's holding you back?</font>

173
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:25,912
<font color="#bafbfe">What's shutting you up?</font>

174
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,164
<font color="#bafbfe">This whole thing stinks
to high heaven.</font>

175
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,692
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm not the only one
on the force who smells it.</font>

176
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:33,928
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, I'll rinse your
bedpan and wipe your butt.</font>

177
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,563
<font color="#bafbfe">That's my job.</font>

178
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:39,158
<font color="#bafbfe">But don't expect any friendly
chitchat out of me, mister.</font>

179
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,370
<font color="#bafbfe">I heard what you done to that girl.</font>

180
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,471
<font color="#bafbfe">I hope they throw away the key.</font>

181
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,985
<font color="#bafbfe">Evening, officer.</font>

182
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,389
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't have to introduce myself, do I?</font>

183
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,857
<font color="#bafbfe">You read the papers.</font>

184
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:06,102
<font color="#bafbfe">This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.</font>

185
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,014
<font color="#bafbfe">You know who I am and what I can do.</font>

186
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,125
<font color="#bafbfe">And I'm doing you, Hartigan.</font>

187
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,412
<font color="#bafbfe">Cold and hard, I'm doing you.</font>

188
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:17,731
<font color="#bafbfe">You blew my son's ear off.</font>

189
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,640
<font color="#bafbfe">You blew his arm off, you even...</font>

190
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,557
<font color="#bafbfe">blew his nuts and his pecker off.</font>

191
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,061
<font color="#bafbfe">He's in a coma right now.</font>

192
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,065
<font color="#bafbfe">They say he may never
come out of it.</font>

193
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,815
<font color="#bafbfe">My boy.</font>

194
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,380
<font color="#bafbfe">He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,</font>

195
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:39,235
<font color="#bafbfe">but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.</font>

196
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,649
<font color="#bafbfe">Pulling that trigger make you feel powerful?</font>

197
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,250
<font color="#bafbfe">Power don't come
from a badge or a gun.</font>

198
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,548
<font color="#bafbfe">Power comes from lying.</font>

199
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,177
<font color="#bafbfe">Lying big, and getting the whole
damn world to play along with you.</font>

200
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,654
<font color="#bafbfe">Once you got everybody agreeing</font>

201
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:02,426
<font color="#bafbfe">with what they know in their hearts
aingt true, you've got them by the balls.</font>

202
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:04,166
<font color="#bafbfe">There's what maybe,</font>

203
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,350
<font color="#bafbfe">500 people in this hospital.</font>

204
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,836
<font color="#bafbfe">I could pump you full of bullets right now,</font>

205
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,586
<font color="#bafbfe">and I wouldn't even be arrested.</font>

206
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,717
<font color="#bafbfe">Everyone would lie for me,</font>

207
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,166
<font color="#bafbfe">everyone who counts.</font>

208
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,869
<font color="#bafbfe">Otherwise, their lies,
everything that runs Sin City,</font>

209
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,673
<font color="#bafbfe">it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.</font>

210
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,980
<font color="#bafbfe">But I want you firm and fit and healthy.</font>

211
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,107
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm even putting up cash of my
own to get you more surgery.</font>

212
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,009
<font color="#bafbfe">Fix that heart condition of yours.</font>

213
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:43,797
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.</font>

214
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,923
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna be convicted
of raping that little brat,</font>

215
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,690
<font color="#bafbfe">and shooting my boy.</font>

216
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:53,042
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison,</font>

217
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,562
<font color="#bafbfe">disgraced, destroyed...</font>

218
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,082
<font color="#bafbfe">alone.</font>

219
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,025
<font color="#bafbfe">Your wife?</font>

220
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,062
<font color="#bafbfe">You tell her the truth and she's dead.</font>

221
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,847
<font color="#bafbfe">You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.</font>

222
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:10,902
<font color="#bafbfe">They won't let me testify.</font>

223
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,142
<font color="#bafbfe">I told the cops that you saved my life,</font>

224
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,023
<font color="#bafbfe">and they just acted like I was crazy.</font>

225
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,767
<font color="#bafbfe">They talked my parents
into keeping me away.</font>

226
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,703
<font color="#bafbfe">They said that you'd done
things that you didn't do.</font>

227
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,355
<font color="#bafbfe">I told them you saved me
from that Roark creep,</font>

228
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,510
<font color="#bafbfe">but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.</font>

229
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,177
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm still a virgin, still alive,</font>

230
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,215
<font color="#bafbfe">thanks to you.</font>

231
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,918
<font color="#bafbfe">They got it all backwards.</font>

232
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,695
<font color="#bafbfe">Sometimes, the truth doesn't
matter like it ought.</font>

233
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:40,542
<font color="#bafbfe">But you'll always remember things right.</font>

234
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:44,095
<font color="#bafbfe">That's gonna mean a lot to me.</font>

235
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,750
<font color="#bafbfe">But stay away, Nancy.</font>

236
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,459
<font color="#bafbfe">They'll kill you if you don't stay away.</font>

237
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,485
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't visit me.</font>

238
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,562
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't write me.</font>

239
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,831
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't even say my name.</font>

240
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,177
<font color="#bafbfe">Maybe you won't let me visit,</font>

241
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,360
<font color="#bafbfe">but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.</font>

242
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,821
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll sign my letters Cordelia.</font>

243
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:07,234
<font color="#bafbfe">That's the name of a really
cool detective in books I read.</font>

244
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,354
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll write you every week...</font>

245
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:12,556
<font color="#bafbfe">for forever.</font>

246
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,375
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, kid.</font>

247
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,385
<font color="#bafbfe">Now, run on home.</font>

248
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:19,787
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not safe for you here.</font>

249
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,784
<font color="#bafbfe">Bye, Nancy.</font>

250
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:30,914
<font color="#bafbfe">I love you.</font>

251
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:41,369
<font color="#bafbfe">John Hartigan.</font>

252
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,697
<font color="#bafbfe">Mr. Law and Order.</font>

253
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,658
<font color="#bafbfe">Mr. By the Book.</font>

254
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,628
<font color="#bafbfe">Mr. High and Mighty.</font>

255
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,293
<font color="#bafbfe">I gotta give you credit,</font>

256
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,750
<font color="#bafbfe">being a straight arrow
for so damn many years</font>

257
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,235
<font color="#bafbfe">without it catching up with you.</font>

258
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,339
<font color="#bafbfe">It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.</font>

259
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,107
<font color="#bafbfe">It's catching up with you but good.</font>

260
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,347
<font color="#bafbfe">Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look good.</font>

261
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,076
<font color="#bafbfe">He's hale and hearty, Tammy.</font>

262
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,522
<font color="#bafbfe">See?</font>

263
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,542
<font color="#bafbfe">He's the picture of health.</font>

264
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:25,287
<font color="#bafbfe">That Tammy there, she's fine, isn't she?</font>

265
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,996
<font color="#bafbfe">I rented her out of Old Town.</font>

266
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,927
<font color="#bafbfe">I wanted to show you what you
won't be getting any of,</font>

267
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:32,636
<font color="#bafbfe">not in prison.</font>

268
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,195
<font color="#bafbfe">You hear me, Hartigan?</font>

269
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,902
<font color="#bafbfe">If you stop being stupid,</font>

270
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,249
<font color="#bafbfe">start playing along with us,</font>

271
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,144
<font color="#bafbfe">you might just get some of Tammy.</font>

272
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,631
<font color="#bafbfe">You see that?</font>

273
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,364
<font color="#bafbfe">She flinched.</font>

274
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,482
<font color="#bafbfe">You make her sick.</font>

275
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,635
<font color="#bafbfe">She heard about you
and that little girl.</font>

276
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:53,221
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is nothing but a price
I promised myself I'd pay,</i></font>

277
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:54,539
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I'm paying it.</i></font>

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,600
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You don't save a little girl's life,</i></font>

279
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,886
<font color="#ffff00"><i>then turn around
and throw her to the dogs.</i></font>

280
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:00,871
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not in my book, you don't.</i></font>

281
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:02,711
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They want a confession.</i></font>

282
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,596
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They won't get it.</i></font>

283
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,974
<font color="#ffff00"><i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i></font>

<font color="#ffff00"><i>She calls herself Cordelia,
just like she promised.</i></font>

285

that would give her away.</i></font>

286

<font color="#ffff00"><i>At first, I figure she'll send
another note or two</i></font>

00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,482
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i></font>

289
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:29,859
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What a sweet kid.</i></font>

290
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:34,331
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I do my best to keep my hand from
shaking when I reach for it.</i></font>

291
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:38,634
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She's the only friend I've got,
the daughter I never had.</i></font>

292
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,020
<font color="#ffff00"><i>My sweet Cordelia.</i></font>

293
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,642
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i></font>

294
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,976
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Eight years pass.</i></font>

295
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:55,743
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then comes a Thursday when
I bound from my cot,</i></font>

296
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:57,828
<font color="#ffff00"><i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i></font>

297
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,499
<font color="#ffff00"><i>only to find myself staring at the
damn floor of my damn cell,</i></font>

298
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,193
<font color="#ffff00"><i>looking for a letter from
Nancy that isn't there.</i></font>

299
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:07,797
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i></font>

300
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,315
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Is she all right?</i></font>

301
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,576
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Did something happen to her?</i></font>

302
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:13,203
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nothing.</i></font>

303
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,086

304
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,158
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not a word from Nancy.</i></font>

305
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:19,937
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Did they find her?</i></font>

306
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,477
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Did they get to her?</i></font>

307
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,197
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Of course!</i></font>

308
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:24,971
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Stupid old man.</i></font>

309
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,027
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Do your math.</i></font>

310
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,960
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nancy's 19 years old.</i></font>

311
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,946
<font color="#ffff00"><i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i></font>

312
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,500
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She was a saint to keep it
up as long as she did.</i></font>

313
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,769
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i></font>

314
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,113
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're alone.</i></font>

315
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,490
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're all alone.</i></font>

316
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,604
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This guy smells awful,</i></font>

317
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,844
<font color="#ffff00"><i>like bad food.</i></font>

318
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:58,206
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Like a corpse left in a garbage
dumpster in the middle of summer.</i></font>

319
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,407
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i></font>

320
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,330
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.</i></font>

321
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,208
<font color="#ffff00"><i>When I come to, I see it.</i></font>

322
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,744
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses,</i></font>

323
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,771
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i></font>

324
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:24,959
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Something soft,</i></font>

325
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,176
<font color="#ffff00"><i>something that ought to be alive,</i></font>

326
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:30,837
<font color="#ffff00"><i>a hunk of meat and bone that ought
to be the index finger</i></font>

327
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,232
<font color="#ffff00"><i>of the right hand of
a 19-year-old girl.</i></font>

328
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,542
<font color="#ffff00"><i>How the hell did they find her?</i></font>

329
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,552
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She was so careful.</i></font>

330
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:40,414
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She never gave away where she
lives or where she works.</i></font>

331
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,034
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've got to get out.</i></font>

332
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,690
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've got to help her.</i></font>

333
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,740
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nothing else matters.</i></font>

334
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,391
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not my life and not my pride, either.</i></font>

335
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,573
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i></font>

336
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:58,322
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You got me, Roark.</i></font>

337
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,142
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You beat me.</i></font>

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,499
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll get it, Claire.</font>

339
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,297
<font color="#bafbfe">It's gotta be Marv.</font>

340
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:14,548
<font color="#bafbfe">He never sleeps and he's
always getting himself in deep.</font>

341
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:15,843
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah.</font>

342
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:18,679
<font color="#bafbfe">What?</font>

343
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,123
<font color="#bafbfe">Hartigan, my God, it is you.</font>

344
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:23,775
<font color="#bafbfe">Yes, yes.</font>

345
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,595
<font color="#bafbfe">No, I'll get right on it, right this second.</font>

346
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,096
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll be there by ten, I promise.</font>

347
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:36,561
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Lucille, she wouldn't give up on
me back before the trial.</i></font>

348
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:40,016
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She almost slugged me when I stopped
her from hiring a new attorney.</i></font>

349
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,352
<font color="#ffff00"><i>When I refused to plead
innocent she did slug me.</i></font>

350
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,372
<font color="#ffff00"><i>When she hears what I'm gonna do
she'll probably slug me again.</i></font>

351
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,023
<font color="#bafbfe">Hartigan.</font>

352
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,161
<font color="#bafbfe">Hot damn.</font>

353
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,550
<font color="#bafbfe">It's like they were waiting for my call.</font>

354
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,496
<font color="#bafbfe">They're ready to deal.
They're practically begging for a deal.</font>

355
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,055
<font color="#bafbfe">They're scared of something.</font>

356
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:05,223
<font color="#bafbfe">One of them promised me
you'd be out on parole</font>

357
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,476
<font color="#bafbfe">if you confessed and expressed
regret and all that other dumb crap</font>

358
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,162
<font color="#bafbfe">that of course we won't go for.</font>

359
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:12,606
<font color="#bafbfe">No, we're getting you out for time served,
no strings attached.</font>

360
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:15,609
<font color="#bafbfe">Then, we're gonna turn right around
and sue those sorry sons of bitches</font>

361
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:16,819
<font color="#bafbfe">for false prosecution.</font>

362
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,829
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna be exonerated.</font>

363
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,015
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna be a very rich man.</font>

364
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:22,825
<font color="#bafbfe">This isn't like you think it is.</font>

365
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,853
<font color="#bafbfe">Like hell it isn't. Doesn't take a
genius to figure out who framed you.</font>

366
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,079
<font color="#bafbfe">But even Senator Roark...
You hung up the phone too soon.</font>

367
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,374
<font color="#bafbfe">We'll use the law, the press...
Going to a lot of trouble for nothing.</font>

368
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,000
<font color="#bafbfe">He will never know what hit him.</font>

369
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,244
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm gonna confess.</font>

370
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,640
<font color="#bafbfe">Excuse me?</font>

371
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,742
<font color="#bafbfe">John Hartigan, crawling on his
belly in front of a parole board,</font>

372
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:43,363
<font color="#bafbfe">confessing to raping a little girl
and blubbering for mercy?</font>

373
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:45,906
<font color="#bafbfe">No, doesn't work.</font>

374
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:50,607
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm going in there and I'm telling them
I'm a twisted, wretched child molester.</font>

375
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,721
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm agreeing to anything
they want from me.</font>

376
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,241
<font color="#bafbfe">All right, you son of a bitch.</font>

377
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:06,742
<font color="#bafbfe">Let's get this over with.</font>

378
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,976
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I say everything they want to hear,</i></font>

379
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,565
<font color="#ffff00"><i>just the way they want to hear it.</i></font>

380
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:20,141
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.</i></font>

382
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,455
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I love you, Nancy.</i></font>

383
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,603
<font color="#bafbfe">It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.</font>

384
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,971
<font color="#bafbfe">You care for a ride?</font>

385
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,912
<font color="#bafbfe">Long as you stay in front of me.</font>

386
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,611
<font color="#bafbfe">Prison's made you paranoid.</font>

387
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,874
<font color="#bafbfe">Talk about water under the bridge.</font>

388
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,259
<font color="#bafbfe">Christ.</font>

389

391
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,509
<font color="#bafbfe">Eight years.</font>

392
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,489
<font color="#bafbfe">Well, if it's any consolation to you...</font>

393
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,402
<font color="#bafbfe">you made me hate myself.</font>

394
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,380
<font color="#bafbfe">Any word from Eileen?</font>

395
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:16,372
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah.</font>

396
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,619

398
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:25,095
<font color="#bafbfe">She had two kids.</font>

399
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,016

Nah.</font>

400
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,029
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't be.</font>

401
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,288
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm glad.</font>

402
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,182
<font color="#bafbfe">Eileen always wanted kids.</font>

403
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:37,403
<font color="#bafbfe">She'll make a good mother.</font>

404
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,047

417
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,351

<font color="#ffff00"><i>this is the place.</i></font>

429
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,406
<font color="#bafbfe">Excuse me, miss.</font>

430
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,374
<font color="#bafbfe">Wondering if you could help me.</font>

431
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:15,865
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm looking for somebody.</font>

432
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,278
<font color="#bafbfe">Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.</font>

433
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,838
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not like that.</font>

434
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:22,298
<font color="#bafbfe">Her name is Nancy.</font>

435
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,884
<font color="#bafbfe">Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.</font>

436
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:27,778
<font color="#bafbfe">She's just warming up.</font>

437
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:38,472
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i></font>

438
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:40,833
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She grew up.</i></font>

439
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,236
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She filled out.</i></font>

440
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,836
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i></font>

441
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:52,552
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And here I was, expecting
a skinny little bookworm,</i></font>

442
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:56,090
<font color="#ffff00"><i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i></font>

443
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:59,546
<font color="#ffff00"><i>How little she told me about
herself in all her letters,</i></font>

444
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,915
<font color="#ffff00"><i>for all those years.</i></font>

445
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,545
<font color="#ffff00"><i>How the hell did they find her?</i></font>

446
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:10,771
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then it hits me.</i></font>

447
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:13,358
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They were bluffing.</i></font>

448
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,960
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've led them straight to her.</i></font>

449
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,164
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i></font>

450
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,734
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i></font>

451
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:34,761
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Lead the creep outside.</i></font>

452
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:37,267
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Get that Beretta away
from him somehow,</i></font>

453
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,686
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and kill him.</i></font>

454
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:43,171
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm just a horny ex-con watching
an exotic dancer.</i></font>

455
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,383
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i></font>

456
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,693
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No, Nancy. Don't notice me.</i></font>

457
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:52,494
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't recognize me.</i></font>

458
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,500
<font color="#bafbfe">There's no time to explain.</font>

459
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,487
<font color="#bafbfe">I've made a terrible mistake,</font>

460
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:09,172
<font color="#bafbfe">put you in terrible danger.</font>

461
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:10,990
<font color="#bafbfe">We need to get out of here
right this second.</font>

462
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,118
<font color="#bafbfe">Whatever you say, Hartigan.</font>

463
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:14,816
<font color="#bafbfe">Let me throw some clothes on.</font>

464
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:20,230
<font color="#bafbfe">And here I'd figured you'd
forgotten all about me.</font>

465
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:22,226
<font color="#bafbfe">Me and my dumb letters.</font>

466
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:23,805
<font color="#bafbfe">Kept me going.</font>

467
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:27,732
<font color="#bafbfe">Kept me from killing myself.</font>

468
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,134
<font color="#bafbfe">Hurry up, will you?</font>

469
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,116
<font color="#bafbfe">Maybe I should drive.</font>

470
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,327
<font color="#bafbfe">Not a chance.</font>

471
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:43,528
<font color="#bafbfe">Nobody but me can keep
this heap running.</font>

472
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:51,619
<font color="#bafbfe">Besides, from the sound of things,</font>

473
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:53,249
<font color="#bafbfe">you might have to shoot somebody.</font>

474
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:54,815
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't have a gun.</font>

475
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,221
<font color="#bafbfe">Under the seat.</font>

476
00:25:58,221 --> 00:25:59,957
<font color="#bafbfe">It's loaded and it works.</font>

477
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,727
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah, this'll do.</font>

478
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,015
<font color="#bafbfe">Taken it to the range
a couple of times.</font>

479
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,051
<font color="#bafbfe">Kicks like a mule.</font>

480
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:13,326
<font color="#bafbfe">Hartigan,</font>

481
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:16,125
<font color="#bafbfe">there's so much I've
wanted to say to you.</font>

482
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,509
<font color="#bafbfe">You've never been far from my thoughts.</font>

483
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,878
<font color="#bafbfe">I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.</font>

484
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,538
<font color="#bafbfe">What are you talking about?</font>

485
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:26,957
<font color="#bafbfe">Damn!</font>

486
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:27,971
<font color="#bafbfe">Keep driving, Nancy.</font>

487
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,782
<font color="#bafbfe">Keep driving and keep
the car on the road!</font>

488
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:30,807
<font color="#bafbfe">I got it!</font>

489
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:36,650
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She's counting on you man.</i></font>

490
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,843
<font color="#bafbfe">What are you doing?</font>

491
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,174
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i></font>

492
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,911
<font color="#bafbfe">Try to keep it on the road, Nancy!</font>

493
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:54,026
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He's a decent shot.</i></font>

494
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,032
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He's got skill,</i></font>

495
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,787
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but he's in too much of a hurry.</i></font>

496
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:59,087
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i></font>

497
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:05,863
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i></font>

498
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,157
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i></font>

499
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,150
<font color="#bafbfe">Stop the car, Nancy.</font>

500
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,469
<font color="#bafbfe">Gotta confirm the kill.</font>

501
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,637
<font color="#bafbfe">What?
Stop the car, now!</font>

502
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:25,538
<font color="#bafbfe">Right. Stop the car, confirm the kill.</font>

503
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:33,127
<font color="#bafbfe">Sorry.</font>

504
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,116
<font color="#bafbfe">I got a little rattled.</font>

505
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:36,317
<font color="#bafbfe">It's Ok.</font>

506
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,589
<font color="#bafbfe">You did great.</font>

507
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,613
<font color="#bafbfe">Sit tight. I'll be right back.</font>

508
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,865
<font color="#bafbfe">No! Let me stay close.</font>

509
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:44,192
<font color="#bafbfe">Nothing can happen
to me when I'm with you.</font>

510
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,493
<font color="#bafbfe">Please? Let me stay close.</font>

511
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,589
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The stink.</i></font>

512
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:00,371
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I almost gag.</i></font>

513
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:03,087
<font color="#ffff00"><i>His blood smells worse than he does.</i></font>

514
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,748
<font color="#bafbfe">Jesus.</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And it's all over the place.</i></font>

515
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:08,826
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i></font>

516
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:12,204
<font color="#bafbfe">We're out of time.</font>

517
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,287
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The sirens.</i></font>

518
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,601
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I used to welcome the sound.</i></font>

519
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:21,028
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nothing to do now but find a
place for the night,</i></font>

520
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,366
<font color="#ffff00"><i>get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i></font>

521
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:25,711
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The stink...</i></font>

522
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,244
<font color="#ffff00"><i>somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.</i></font>

523
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:30,589
<font color="#bafbfe">Nancy, I went to your apartment.</font>

524
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,984
<font color="#bafbfe">Your window was thrown wide open.</font>

525
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,894
<font color="#bafbfe">The rooms looked almost empty.</font>

526
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,212
<font color="#bafbfe">That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.</font>

527
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:38,673
<font color="#bafbfe">My window?</font>

528
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:41,450
<font color="#bafbfe">Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!</font>

529
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,720
<font color="#bafbfe">I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.</font>

530
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,432
<font color="#bafbfe">But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.</font>

531
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:51,351
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm such an asshole.
You should sit down.</font>

532
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,822
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll feel better if you sit down.</font>

533
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:58,233
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've never been all that good with people.</i></font>

534
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:02,153
<font color="#ffff00"><i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,</i></font>

535

doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i></font>

536
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:07,961
<font color="#bafbfe">So it's always been you, Hartigan.</font>

537
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:10,646
<font color="#bafbfe">All these years.</font>

538
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:13,907
<font color="#bafbfe">It's just nerves making you say that, Nancy.</font>

539
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,411
<font color="#bafbfe">You're just exhausted.</font>

540
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,053
<font color="#bafbfe">You need to sleep.</font>

541
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:20,390
<font color="#bafbfe">Sleep with me.
Stop it, Nancy!</font>

542
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,192
<font color="#bafbfe">Eight years.</font>

543
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:26,363
<font color="#bafbfe">Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?</font>

544
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:29,765
<font color="#bafbfe">It wasn't just gratitude.</font>

545
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:32,434
<font color="#bafbfe">I tried to fall in love with boys.</font>

546
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:35,194
<font color="#bafbfe">Even thought I did once or twice.</font>

547
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,713
<font color="#bafbfe">But I was already in love...</font>

548
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,019
<font color="#bafbfe">with you.</font>

549
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:41,743
<font color="#bafbfe">No.</font>

550
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:20,465
<font color="#bafbfe">There's wrong and there's
wrong and then there's this.</font>

551
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,852
<font color="#bafbfe">For God's sakes, you're just a kid!</font>

552
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:25,653
<font color="#bafbfe">I love you.</font>

553
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:32,670
<font color="#bafbfe">I love you, too.</font>

554
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:35,039

556
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:41,537
<font color="#bafbfe">No, Nancy.</font>

557
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,209
<font color="#bafbfe">You recognize my voice, Hartigan?</font>

558
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:50,188
<font color="#bafbfe">Recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop?</font>

559
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,424
<font color="#bafbfe">I look different, but I bet
you can recognize my voice.</font>

560
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:58,526
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure. I recognize your voice, Junior.</font>

00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:34,791
<font color="#bafbfe">It better be ready! It better be perfect!</font>

573
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:39,547
<font color="#bafbfe">I get to do whatever I want,</font>

574
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,616
<font color="#bafbfe">however I want,
whenever I want it!</font>

575
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:44,652
<font color="#bafbfe">My dad.</font>

576
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,435
<font color="#bafbfe">I'd love him if I didn't hate him.</font>

577
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,528
<font color="#bafbfe">He spent a fortune hiring
every expert on the planet</font>

578
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,682
<font color="#bafbfe">to grow back that equipment
you blew off between my legs,</font>

579
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:56,636
<font color="#bafbfe">just so the old fart can hold out some
kind of hope of having a grand kid.</font>

580
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,090
<font color="#bafbfe">Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.</font>

581
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,488
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm not complaining, no.</font>

582
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:05,319
<font color="#bafbfe">Since you've been gone,
I'm having the time of my life.</font>

583
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:08,632
<font color="#bafbfe">And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.</font>

584
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:12,833
<font color="#bafbfe">We wondered who wrote those letters.
She left not a clue.</font>

585
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,880
<font color="#bafbfe">Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.</font>

586
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:24,564
<font color="#bafbfe">A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.</font>

587
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:26,917
<font color="#bafbfe">Nancy, don't scream.</font>

588
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,487
<font color="#bafbfe">Whatever he does to you, don't scream.</font>

589
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:34,907
<font color="#bafbfe">She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.</font>

590
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,086
<font color="#bafbfe">And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.</font>

591
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,913
<font color="#bafbfe">They've all screamed, Hartigan.</font>

592
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:43,959
<font color="#bafbfe">Dozens of them, maybe a hundred.</font>

593
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,045
<font color="#bafbfe">Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.</font>

594
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,006
<font color="#bafbfe">If there weren't
so many people hereabout,</font>

595
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:53,227
<font color="#bafbfe">I would show you how I'm gonna
make dear old Nancy scream.</font>

596
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:55,927
<font color="#bafbfe">It's gonna be one hell of a show!</font>

597
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:06,421
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is it.</i></font>

598
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,409
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No way to fight it now.</i></font>

599
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:11,236
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No hope left.</i></font>

600
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,663
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No chance.</i></font>

601
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:14,327
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is it.</i></font>

602
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:17,087
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is the end.</i></font>

603
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,412
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No.</i></font>

604
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:22,859
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Give it a shot, old man.</i></font>

605
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,317
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Keep your neck tight.</i></font>

606
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:25,596
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Move.</i></font>

607
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,545
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The window, maybe there's an alarm.</i></font>

608
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:28,804
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The window.</i></font>

609
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:31,824
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Keep your neck tight,
goddamn it! Stay conscious!</i></font>

610
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,593
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Stay conscious.</i></font>

611
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:36,344
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No alarm.</i></font>

612
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,698
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i></font>

613
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,398
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You can do it.</i></font>

614
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:42,099
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You can do it.</i></font>

615
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:46,586
<font color="#bafbfe">It is inclement upon me to comment
with marked displeasure,</font>

616
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:49,546
<font color="#bafbfe">on your rash impulsiveness in selecting</font>

617
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,736
<font color="#bafbfe">such an eye-catching
and impractical car</font>

618
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:54,863
<font color="#bafbfe">to heist, Mr. Shlubb.</font>

619
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:57,473
<font color="#bafbfe">Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,</font>

620
00:33:57,575 --> 00:34:00,826
<font color="#bafbfe">you must none-the-less admit
to the sheer phallic majesty</font>

621
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:02,270
<font color="#bafbfe">of said Ferrari's performance.</font>

622
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:07,442
<font color="#bafbfe">An engine of Cyclopean power throbs
beneath this steel stallion's hood.</font>

623
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:13,195
<font color="#bafbfe">Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query which I now put forth to you.</font>

624
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:16,382
<font color="#bafbfe">Wherein this most streamlined and...</font>

625
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,454
<font color="#bafbfe">trunkless of transports,</font>

626
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:22,074
<font color="#bafbfe">boner-inspiring though it may be,</font>

627
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,396
<font color="#bafbfe">wherein are we to reposit,</font>

628
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,898
<font color="#bafbfe">our recently deceased to cargo?</font>

629
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,766
<font color="#bafbfe">A worthy concern.</font>

630
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:34,467
<font color="#bafbfe">Neatly elucidated.</font>

631
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,907
<font color="#bafbfe">I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.</font>

632
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:49,867
<font color="#bafbfe">Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!</font>

633
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,719
<font color="#bafbfe">In plain English, creep!</font>

634
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,215
<font color="#bafbfe">The answer you seek is rural,</font>

635
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,445
<font color="#bafbfe">even agrarian.</font>

636
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,170

and to stay away from it.</i></font>

00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:09,362
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal.</i></font>

<font color="#ffff00"><i>Once things get loud,
I'll have use for the cannons.</i></font>

642
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,976
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i></font>

643
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,512
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Quiet and nasty.</i></font>

644
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:21,717
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nancy's car, six miles from the farm.</i></font>

<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nobody but me can keep this heap running,
she told me.</i></font>

646
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:26,309
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Good girl.</i></font>

00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,873
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The car stalled out on
that yellow bastard</i></font>

648
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:30,858
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and you didn't tell him how
to start it up again.</i></font>

649
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,079
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You kept your mouth shut.</i></font>

650
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:34,963
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'll bet Junior was furious.</i></font>

651
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:37,733
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i></font>

652
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:39,534
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But you stayed strong.</i></font>

653
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,637
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You bought a few extra minutes.</i></font>

654
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:43,871
<font color="#ffff00"><i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i></font>

655
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:45,791
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't scream.</i></font>

656
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:49,344
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I ditch the car a mile
or so from the farm</i></font>

657
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,961
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and make my way through the woods.</i></font>

658
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:53,315
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i></font>

659
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,106
<font color="#ffff00"><i>My heart.</i></font>

660

667
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:18,614

you stupid cow!</font>

670
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:52,509
<font color="#bafbfe">Do you think I'm tired?</font>

671
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,110
<font color="#bafbfe">Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?</font>

672
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,512
<font color="#bafbfe">You're the one who's gonna crack!</font>

673
00:36:58,213 --> 00:36:59,389
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll crack!</font>

674
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:02,237
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll cry and beg!</font>

675
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:04,777
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll scream!</font>

676
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:08,373
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!</font>

677
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:11,275
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll scream!</font>

678
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:19,567
<font color="#bafbfe">You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?</font>

679
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,862
<font color="#bafbfe">That was foreplay.</font>

680
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:25,666
<font color="#bafbfe">Hartigan was right about you.</font>

681
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,094
<font color="#bafbfe">You can't get it up unless I scream.</font>

682
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,481
<font color="#bafbfe">You're pathetic!</font>

683
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,344
<font color="#bafbfe">You're pathetic.</font>

684
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:40,990
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.</font>

685
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:44,791
<font color="#bafbfe">It brings out the worst in me.</font>

686
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:53,418
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Stupid old man!</i></font>

687
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,347

688

<font color="#bafbfe">Damn!</font>

689
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:00,724

693
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,880
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't take no chances.
Perforate the fool.</font>

694
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:16,215
<font color="#bafbfe">Good advice.</font>

695
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:28,353
<font color="#bafbfe">Give it up, Junior.</font>

696
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,452
<font color="#bafbfe">It's over.</font>

697
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:33,041
<font color="#bafbfe">Let her go.
You're dreaming, Hartigan!</font>

698
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:37,942
<font color="#bafbfe">I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!</font>

699
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,148
<font color="#bafbfe">Look at you!</font>

700
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:41,398
<font color="#bafbfe">You're about to keel over!</font>

701
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,335
<font color="#bafbfe">You can't even lift that cannon!</font>

702
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:45,635
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, I can.</font>

703
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,231
<font color="#bafbfe">You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.</font>

704
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,217
<font color="#bafbfe">Nancy, I'm sorry.</font>

705
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:01,918
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm taking no chances with you.</font>

706
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:07,206
<font color="#bafbfe">First I soften you up,</font>

707
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:08,940
<font color="#bafbfe">and then it's showtime.</font>

708
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:13,317
<font color="#bafbfe">Here it comes.</font>

709
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,275
<font color="#bafbfe">It's gonna hurt.</font>

710
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,342
<font color="#bafbfe">You're right about that.</font>

711
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:25,018
<font color="#bafbfe">Sucker.</font>

712

<font color="#bafbfe">So long, Junior.</font>

718
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,362
<font color="#bafbfe">Been a pleasure.</font>

719
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,739
<font color="#bafbfe">I didn't scream, Hartigan,</font>

720

<font color="#bafbfe">I know it, baby.</font>

723
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:18,286
<font color="#bafbfe">You grew up strong.</font>

<font color="#bafbfe">Thanks for remembering my coat.</font>

728
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,637
<font color="#bafbfe">And for all the little things.</font>

729
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,438
<font color="#bafbfe">Like saving my life, twice.</font>

730

745
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:45,041
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Maybe after I've pulled off that miracle,

778
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:57,150
<font color="#bafbfe">I see a crazy calm.</font>

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,079
<font color="#bafbfe">Claire?</font>

857
00:59:57,759 --> 00:59:59,503
<font color="#bafbfe">Now, don't worry, Lucille.</font>

858
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,068
<font color="#bafbfe">I was just grazed.</font>

859
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:03,702
<font color="#bafbfe">You got any beers around this place?</font>

860
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:05,869
<font color="#bafbfe">No way I'm giving
you any alcohol.</font>

861
01:00:07,018 --> 01:00:07,820
<font color="#bafbfe">Besides,</font>

862
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:10,652
<font color="#bafbfe">it's not what you came
here for anyway, is it?</font>

863
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,023
<font color="#bafbfe">No.</font>

864
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:14,949
<font color="#bafbfe">Go ahead.
You're worse without them.</font>

865
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,378
<font color="#bafbfe">Thanks. You're the best.</font>

866
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:19,954
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i></font>

867
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:22,307
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i></font>

868
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:25,835
<font color="#ffff00"><i>With that body of hers she could
have any man she wants.</i></font>

869
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:28,905
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i></font>

870
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:33,059
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.</i></font>

871
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,914
<font color="#bafbfe">Haven't seen you like this in a while.</font>

872
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:39,376
<font color="#bafbfe">Got in a fight with some cops.</font>

873
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,242
<font color="#bafbfe">Didn't happen to kill any of them, did you?</font>

874
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:42,608
<font color="#bafbfe">Not that I know, but...</font>

875
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:45,304
<font color="#bafbfe">they know they've been in a fight,
that's for damn sure.</font>

876
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:48,224
<font color="#bafbfe">How do you suppose I'm gonna
square this with the board?</font>

877
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:51,231
<font color="#bafbfe">There aingt no squaring it.
Not this time.</font>

878
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:53,949
<font color="#bafbfe">This isn't some barroom brawl.</font>

879
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:57,918
<font color="#bafbfe">Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.</font>

880
01:00:57,918 --> 01:00:58,976
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey, hey. This is big.</font>

881
01:00:59,277 --> 01:01:00,862
<font color="#bafbfe">Settle down, Marv.
Take another pill.</font>

882
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,038
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey! There aingt no settling down!</font>

883
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:05,751
<font color="#bafbfe">This is blood for blood,
and by the gallons.</font>

884
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:10,639
<font color="#bafbfe">This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.</font>

885
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,458
<font color="#bafbfe">They're back.
There's no choices left.</font>

886
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,335
<font color="#bafbfe">And I'm ready for war.</font>

887
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:18,639
<font color="#bafbfe">Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.</font>

888
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,840
<font color="#bafbfe">Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.</font>

889
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:26,880
<font color="#bafbfe">But I'm out now.</font>

890
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:30,967
<font color="#bafbfe">It took somebody who was kind
to me getting killed to do it.</font>

891
01:01:31,168 --> 01:01:32,259
<font color="#bafbfe">But I'm out.</font>

892
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,192
<font color="#bafbfe">I know exactly what I gotta do.</font>

893
01:01:37,148 --> 01:01:40,393
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Now, for Gladys. Sweet Gladys.</i></font>

894
01:01:41,195 --> 01:01:43,146
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But I'll have to sneak past Mom,</i></font>

895
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,847
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and her ears have gotten a whole lot
better since she went blind.</i></font>

896
01:01:51,496 --> 01:01:54,007
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Mom still hasn't changed
a thing in this room.</i></font>

897
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:58,235
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Every week she dusts it all off so it
looks like it was only yesterday</i></font>

898
01:01:58,336 --> 01:01:59,338
<font color="#ffff00"><i>that I moved out.</i></font>

899
01:02:00,338 --> 01:02:03,090
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Every time I come visit,
she has me sleep in here,</i></font>

900
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:06,436
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and the old smells make me cry
like they do right now.</i></font>

901
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,472
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I knew Gladys would be safe here.</i></font>

902
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:13,327
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I call her Gladys after one of
the sisters from school.</i></font>

903
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:15,521
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She's almost lived up to the name.</i></font>

904
01:02:16,822 --> 01:02:19,324
<font color="#ffff00"><i>For a while we just get the
feel of each other back.</i></font>

905
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:20,726
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Good as ever.</i></font>

906
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:23,663
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I tell her about Goldie and
what we have to do.</i></font>

907
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:26,331
<font color="#bafbfe">Marvin?</font>

908
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:29,449
<font color="#bafbfe">Is that you, baby?</font>

909
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:32,161
<font color="#bafbfe">Yes, Mom.
I'm sorry I woke you up.</font>

910
01:02:32,163 --> 01:02:33,811
<font color="#bafbfe">I couldn't sleep for the worry.</font>

911
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:36,257
<font color="#bafbfe">There were men here looking for you.</font>

912
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,344
<font color="#bafbfe">They weren't police.</font>

913
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:40,842
<font color="#bafbfe">It was about my job.</font>

914
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,963
<font color="#bafbfe">I got a new job.</font>

915
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,702
<font color="#bafbfe">It's night work.</font>

916
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:47,965
<font color="#bafbfe">What did you do to your face?</font>

917
01:02:48,387 --> 01:02:51,097
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, I... cut myself shaving.</font>

918
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,710
<font color="#bafbfe">You're getting confused again, aren't you?</font>

919
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:59,311
<font color="#bafbfe">Mom, I feel better than I have in years.</font>

920
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:06,028
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You were scared, weren't you, Goldie?</i></font>

921
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,739
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it.</i></font>

922
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,476
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So you hit the saloons, the bad places,</i></font>

923
01:03:12,077 --> 01:03:15,456
<font color="#ffff00"><i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i></font>

924
01:03:16,456 --> 01:03:19,208
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm gonna find that son of a bitch
that killed you,</i></font>

925
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:21,621
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I'm gonna give him
the hard goodbye.</i></font>

926
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:26,123
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Walk down the right back alley in Sin City...</i></font>

927
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,036
<font color="#bafbfe">Leave your hands off Nancy.</font>

928
01:03:28,061 --> 01:03:29,626
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and you could find anything.</i></font>

929
01:03:29,804 --> 01:03:31,938
<font color="#bafbfe">That coat looks like Baghdad.</font>

930
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:34,242
<font color="#bafbfe">So does your face.</font>

931
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:35,666
<font color="#bafbfe">Take off!</font>

932
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,367
<font color="#bafbfe">He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.</font>

933
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:46,170
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i></font>

934
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:50,239
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nancy's just getting
started with her gig,</i></font>

935
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,309
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i></font>

936
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:54,518
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i></font>

937
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:57,648
<font color="#ffff00"><i>shoulder to shoulder with all
the other losers like me.</i></font>

938
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:00,117
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But that's not what I'm looking for tonight.</i></font>

939
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:04,018
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm looking for something small and hairy.</i></font>

940
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:11,702
<font color="#bafbfe">Take it easy, Weevil.
I'm here to do you a favor.</font>

941
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:13,681
<font color="#bafbfe">It's money in your pocket.</font>

942
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:17,567
<font color="#bafbfe">Spread the word.</font>

943
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,519
<font color="#bafbfe">Tell him I've been hitting
the joints drunk off my butt,</font>

944
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:24,320
<font color="#bafbfe">shooting my mouth off,
crying over some hot babe named Goldie.</font>

945
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:39,880
<font color="#bafbfe">What'll it be, Marv?</font>

946
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:42,842
<font color="#bafbfe">A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep them coming.</font>

947
01:04:43,043 --> 01:04:45,244
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, honey. You take it slow, now.</font>

948
01:05:01,478 --> 01:05:03,947
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i></font>

949
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:07,650
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He just had the rotten luck of being
born in the wrong century.</i></font>

950
01:05:08,152 --> 01:05:10,945
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He'd be right at home on
some ancient battlefield,</i></font>

951
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:13,222
<font color="#ffff00"><i>swinging an ax into
somebody's face.</i></font>

952
01:05:13,824 --> 01:05:17,527
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Or in a Roman arena taking a sword
to other gladiators like him.</i></font>

953
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:21,728
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i></font>

954
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:26,880
<font color="#bafbfe">Show's over, dickwad.</font>

955
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:27,985
<font color="#bafbfe">Drink up.</font>

956
01:05:28,163 --> 01:05:30,762
<font color="#bafbfe">That's one fine looking coat
you're wearing there.</font>

957
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:36,673
<font color="#bafbfe">Your killing days are over,
you over-the-hill,</font>

958
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,264
<font color="#bafbfe">do-gooder son of a bitch.</font>

959
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:39,965
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I love hit men.</i></font>

960
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:43,664
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No matter what you do to them,
you don't feel bad.</i></font>

961
01:05:51,653 --> 01:05:52,829
<font color="#bafbfe">Take it off.</font>

962
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:54,030
<font color="#bafbfe">What?</font>

963
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,632
<font color="#bafbfe">A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.</font>

964
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,018
<font color="#bafbfe">All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!</font>

965
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,614
<font color="#bafbfe">It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.</font>

966
01:06:02,914 --> 01:06:04,429
<font color="#bafbfe">The guy who did that,</font>

967
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:06,938
<font color="#bafbfe">he knew what he was doing.</font>

968
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,403
<font color="#bafbfe">So tell me, man. Who sent you?</font>

969
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:16,152
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't hear you giving me any names.</font>

970
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:19,621
<font color="#bafbfe">So I guess when I shot you
in the belly I aimed a little too high.</font>

971
01:06:22,726 --> 01:06:26,826
<font color="#bafbfe">You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.</font>

972
01:06:32,018 --> 01:06:33,722
<font color="#bafbfe">It was Telly. Telly Stern.</font>

973
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:35,942
<font color="#bafbfe">Passed me the order.</font>

974
01:06:37,115 --> 01:06:39,719
<font color="#bafbfe">He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.</font>

975
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,380
<font color="#bafbfe">Thanks again.</font>

976
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:50,552
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i></font>

977
01:06:50,753 --> 01:06:54,291
<font color="#ffff00"><i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i></font>

978
01:06:55,092 --> 01:06:56,710
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i></font>

979
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,846
<font color="#bafbfe">Bastard.</font>

980
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:01,947
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna pay for what you did to me.</font>

981
01:07:05,936 --> 01:07:07,219
<font color="#bafbfe">Feel like talking, Louie?</font>

982
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:09,606
<font color="#bafbfe">How many got paid off for the frame, Louie?</font>

983
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:11,541
<font color="#bafbfe">How many for the kill?</font>

984
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:14,242
<font color="#bafbfe">It was Connelly. He set me up.</font>

985
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:18,414
<font color="#bafbfe">He'll never talk.</font>

986
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,681
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't know about you,
but I'm having a ball.</font>

987
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:28,063
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Connelly talks.</i></font>

988
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:30,367
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They all talk.</i></font>

989
01:07:31,628 --> 01:07:33,655
<font color="#bafbfe">What have been your sins, my son?</font>

990
01:07:33,755 --> 01:07:36,706
<font color="#bafbfe">Padre, I don't want
to keep you up all night,</font>

991
01:07:36,807 --> 01:07:39,052
<font color="#bafbfe">so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.</font>

992
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:42,338
<font color="#bafbfe">These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over them.</font>

993
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,806
<font color="#bafbfe">You're speaking figuratively.</font>

994
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:46,958
<font color="#bafbfe">When I need to find something out,</font>

995
01:07:47,382 --> 01:07:49,878
<font color="#bafbfe">I just go out and look for somebody</font>

996
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,764
<font color="#bafbfe">that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.</font>

997
01:07:52,065 --> 01:07:54,217
<font color="#bafbfe">Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.</font>

998
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,170
<font color="#bafbfe">By way of a for instance,</font>

999
01:07:57,896 --> 01:08:00,043
<font color="#bafbfe">I killed three men tonight.</font>

1000
01:08:01,525 --> 01:08:02,684
<font color="#bafbfe">Tortured them first.</font>

1001
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,288
<font color="#bafbfe">You might say I been,</font>

1002
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,411
<font color="#bafbfe">working my way up the food chain.</font>

1003
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:09,724
<font color="#bafbfe">First two were minnows,
small-time messengers.</font>

1004
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,411
<font color="#bafbfe">But it was Connelly,</font>

1005
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:14,670
<font color="#bafbfe">the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.</font>

1006
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,698
<font color="#bafbfe">Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.</font>

1007
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,877
<font color="#bafbfe">Just give me a damn name.</font>

1008
01:08:21,878 --> 01:08:22,684
<font color="#bafbfe">Roark.</font>

1009
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:24,921
<font color="#bafbfe">You really are pushing your luck Padre.</font>

1010
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:27,113
<font color="#bafbfe">feeding me garbage like that.</font>

1011
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,275
<font color="#bafbfe">It can't be that big.</font>

1012
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,270
<font color="#bafbfe">There's a farm at North Cross and Lennox.</font>

1013
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:32,918
<font color="#bafbfe">It's all there.</font>

1014
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:34,398
<font color="#bafbfe">Find out for yourself.</font>

1015
01:08:34,975 --> 01:08:35,975
<font color="#bafbfe">And while you're at it,</font>

1016
01:08:36,476 --> 01:08:41,377
<font color="#bafbfe">ask yourself if that corpse
of a slut is worth dying for.</font>

1017
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:43,942
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Worth dying for.</i></font>

1018
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:46,069
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Worth killing for.</i></font>

1019
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:48,689
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Worth going to hell for.</i></font>

1020
01:08:49,489 --> 01:08:50,489
<font color="#bafbfe">Amen.</font>

1021
01:08:54,912 --> 01:08:57,271
<font color="#ffff00"><i>His keys say the padre
drove a Mercedes,</i></font>

1022
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:00,884
<font color="#ffff00"><i>or at least that's what they're passing off
as</i> a <i>Mercedes these days.</i></font>

1023
01:09:01,585 --> 01:09:04,671
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Modern cars, they all look
like electric shavers.</i></font>

1024
01:09:12,345 --> 01:09:13,556
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie.</font>

1025
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:17,757
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie!</font>

1026
01:09:28,694 --> 01:09:29,947
<font color="#bafbfe">It couldn't be Goldie.</font>

1027
01:09:30,948 --> 01:09:34,400
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i></font>

1028
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:38,462
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i></font>

1029
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:40,864
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i></font>

1030
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,167
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Goldie's dead,</i></font>

1031
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:45,712
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and that's the whole reason that I've
been doing what I've been doing.</i></font>

1032
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:50,012
<font color="#ffff00"><i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i></font>

1033
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:54,604
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The cold thing,</i></font>

1034
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:58,524
<font color="#ffff00"><i>it creeps into my gut and tells me
one more time it won't let go.</i></font>

1035
01:09:59,425 --> 01:10:01,595
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i></font>

1036
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:03,472
<font color="#ffff00"><i>People have died here...</i></font>

1037
01:10:05,774 --> 01:10:06,841
<font color="#ffff00"><i>the wrong way.</i></font>

1038
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:11,341
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't want to fight, pooch.</font>

1039
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:17,328
<font color="#bafbfe">I got no gripe with you.</font>

1040
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:21,914
<font color="#bafbfe">Easy, boy.</font>

1041
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:27,737
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No way I was gonna
use my gun on you, buddy.</i></font>

1042
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:30,431
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i></font>

1043
01:10:31,132 --> 01:10:34,351
<font color="#ffff00"><i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i></font>

1044
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:37,552
<font color="#bafbfe"><i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i></font>

1045
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:42,926
<font color="#bafbfe"><i>Here we go.</i></font>

1046
01:10:48,483 --> 01:10:51,382
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i></font>

1047
01:10:57,283 --> 01:10:58,283
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I go blind.</i></font>

1048
01:10:58,609 --> 01:10:59,773
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not a sound.</i></font>

1049
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:02,032
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nobody's that quiet.</i></font>

1050
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:05,733
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Nobody except the one who snuck into
that hotel room two nights ago.</i></font>

1051
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:07,961
<font color="#bafbfe">It was you, you bastard.</font>

1052
01:11:08,586 --> 01:11:09,603
<font color="#bafbfe">You killed her.</font>

1053
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,547
<font color="#bafbfe">You killed Goldie.</font>

1054
01:11:12,548 --> 01:11:13,560
<font color="#bafbfe">It was...</font>

1055
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,170
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I blew it, Goldie.</i></font>

1056
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:20,256
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i></font>

1057
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:22,824
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Too quiet, too quick.</i></font>

1058
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:24,470
<font color="#ffff00"><i>A killer born.</i></font>

1059
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,270
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i></font>

1060
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:42,520
<font color="#bafbfe">He keeps the heads.</font>

1061
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:44,505
<font color="#bafbfe">He eats the rest.</font>

1062
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:46,082
<font color="#bafbfe">Lucille?</font>

1063
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:48,006
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not just that wolf of his.</font>

1064
01:11:50,212 --> 01:11:51,622
<font color="#bafbfe">The wolf just gets scraps.</font>

1065
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:54,422
<font color="#bafbfe">Bones.</font>

1066
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:56,726
<font color="#bafbfe">It's him.</font>

1067
01:11:57,927 --> 01:12:01,728
<font color="#bafbfe">He... eats... people.</font>

1068
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:04,869
<font color="#bafbfe">He cooks them like they were steaks.</font>

1069
01:12:05,694 --> 01:12:07,001
<font color="#bafbfe">Let's get you warm.</font>

1070
01:12:07,078 --> 01:12:08,313
<font color="#bafbfe">Just like they were steaks.</font>

1071
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:10,532
<font color="#bafbfe">Now he's got both of us.</font>

1072
01:12:11,733 --> 01:12:12,850
<font color="#bafbfe">It's all right.</font>

1073
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,960
<font color="#bafbfe">Take a nice, slow breath.</font>

1074
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:17,355
<font color="#bafbfe">Just look at the heads on the wall.</font>

1075
01:12:18,657 --> 01:12:20,149
<font color="#bafbfe">The heads on the wall.</font>

1076
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:22,452
<font color="#bafbfe">The heads on the wall.</font>

1077
01:12:23,453 --> 01:12:24,360
<font color="#bafbfe">Son of a bitch!</font>

1078
01:12:24,586 --> 01:12:26,564
<font color="#bafbfe">He kept smiling that damned smile.</font>

1079
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,550
<font color="#bafbfe">He made me watch,</font>

1080
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:30,751
<font color="#bafbfe">him suck the meat off my fingers.</font>

1081
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:33,546
<font color="#bafbfe">He made me watch!
Oh, Jesus.</font>

1082
01:12:34,547 --> 01:12:38,547
<font color="#bafbfe">He made me watch!</font>

1083
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:48,804
<font color="#bafbfe">Christ, I could use a cigarette.</font>

1084
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:50,835
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Dames.</i></font>

1085
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,948
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i></font>

1086
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:56,319
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i></font>

1087
01:12:57,819 --> 01:12:59,855
<font color="#bafbfe">You've brought us some big
trouble this time, Marv.</font>

1088
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,599
<font color="#bafbfe">Whoever's behind this whole thing,</font>

1089
01:13:01,823 --> 01:13:03,734
<font color="#bafbfe">has his connections right
in the department.</font>

1090
01:13:04,911 --> 01:13:06,104
<font color="#bafbfe">Any leads?</font>

1091
01:13:07,204 --> 01:13:09,167
<font color="#bafbfe">One guy I talked to told me it was,</font>

1092
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:10,698
<font color="#bafbfe">Roark running the show.</font>

1093
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:11,876
<font color="#bafbfe">Whoever it is,</font>

1094
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,100
<font color="#bafbfe">he knew I was checking out that
hooker almost before I did.</font>

1095
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:16,822
<font color="#bafbfe">What hooker?</font>

1096
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:18,556
<font color="#bafbfe">The one you've been obsessing over.</font>

1097
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:20,644
<font color="#bafbfe">The dead one.</font>

1098
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:22,996
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie.</font>

1099
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:25,539
<font color="#bafbfe">I didn't know she was a hooker.</font>

1100
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,740
<font color="#bafbfe">Doesn't make any difference
about anything.</font>

1101
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:33,002
<font color="#bafbfe">But I didn't know that.</font>

1102
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:34,940
<font color="#bafbfe">She was high-class stuff.</font>

1103
01:13:36,318 --> 01:13:37,993
<font color="#bafbfe">Must have shown you quite a time.</font>

1104
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:39,019
<font color="#bafbfe">Quiet.</font>

1105
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:40,413
<font color="#bafbfe">There's a car coming.</font>

1106
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,890
<font color="#bafbfe">Kevin!</font>

1107
01:13:47,871 --> 01:13:50,907
<font color="#ffff00"><i>All I've got is a face, and a name.</i></font>

1108
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:53,177
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'll see you later, Kevin.</i></font>

1109
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:04,835
<font color="#bafbfe">Let's go,</font>

1110
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:22,947
<font color="#bafbfe">They're done checking the house.</font>

1111
01:14:23,448 --> 01:14:24,774
<font color="#bafbfe">They're coming this way.</font>

1112
01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:27,360
<font color="#bafbfe">Bastards. I'll show them.</font>

1113
01:14:33,707 --> 01:14:35,478
<font color="#bafbfe">You're not gonna
get either of us killed, Marv.</font>

1114
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:39,672
<font color="#bafbfe">No, don't shoot! Please.</font>

1115
01:14:40,673 --> 01:14:42,807
<font color="#bafbfe">Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.</font>

1116
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:44,653
<font color="#bafbfe">He's unconscious and unarmed,</font>

1117
01:14:45,554 --> 01:14:46,854
<font color="#bafbfe">so there's no need to kill him.</font>

1118
01:14:54,645 --> 01:14:56,706
<font color="#bafbfe">Captain, the target, there's no sign of him.</font>

1119
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:58,192
<font color="#bafbfe">Here's a sign!</font>

1120
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:16,523
<font color="#bafbfe">That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing.</font>

1121
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:27,737
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I keep coming back to that cop
I just killed and what he told me.</i></font>

1122
01:15:28,137 --> 01:15:30,914
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i></font>

1123
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:33,442
<font color="#ffff00"><i>so I took my time with that son of a bitch.</i></font>

1124
01:15:34,143 --> 01:15:37,680
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It wasn't till I showed him all those
pieces of himself that he said it.</i></font>

1125
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,381
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just a name.</i></font>

1126
01:15:40,206 --> 01:15:41,942
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Patrick Henry Roark,</i></font>

1127

1128
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:46,305
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i></font>

1129
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:50,292
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i></font>

1130
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:54,514
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i></font>

1131
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:58,967
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i></font>

1132
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:02,769
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And here he's gonna get killed in
the name of a dead hooker.</i></font>

1133
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:06,262
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm getting used to the idea.</i></font>

1134
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:08,698
<font color="#ffff00"><i>More and more,
I'm liking the sound of it.</i></font>

1135
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,757
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i></font>

1136
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:15,717
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What if I'm wrong?</i></font>

1137
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:17,706
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've got a condition.</i></font>

1138
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,712
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I get confused sometimes.</i></font>

1139
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:22,028
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And with Lucille dead,</i></font>

1140
01:16:22,353 --> 01:16:23,934
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I can't get my medicine.</i></font>

1141
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,046
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i></font>

1142
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:30,947
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What if I've turned into what they've
always said I was gonna turn into?</i></font>

1143
01:16:32,327 --> 01:16:33,587
<font color="#ffff00"><i>A maniac.</i></font>

1144
01:16:34,787 --> 01:16:36,105
<font color="#ffff00"><i>A psycho killer.</i></font>

1145
01:16:37,207 --> 01:16:39,958
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Can't kill a man without knowing
for sure you ought to.</i></font>

1146
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,260
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've gotta know for sure.</i></font>

1147
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:47,408
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The merchandise is on display,</i></font>

1148
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:49,559
<font color="#ffff00"><i>by the time I make
my way to Old Town.</i></font>

1149
01:16:50,136 --> 01:16:52,630
<font color="#ffff00"><i>For an hour or so,
I ask around about Goldie.</i></font>

1150
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,307
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i></font>

1151
01:16:55,809 --> 01:16:57,618
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i></font>

1152
01:16:58,019 --> 01:17:00,695
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and if she was she has roots here,</i></font>

1153
01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:02,896
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Friends, maybe even family.</i></font>

1154
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:09,791
<font color="#bafbfe">You can't be Goldie.</font>

1155
01:17:10,315 --> 01:17:11,529
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie's dead.</font>

1156
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:24,762
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie. Yeah, sure, right.</font>

1157
01:17:25,963 --> 01:17:29,692
<font color="#bafbfe">I haven't eaten anything or
taken my medicine for days now.</font>

1158
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:31,961
<font color="#bafbfe">No wonder I'm seeing things.</font>

1159
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:33,783
<font color="#bafbfe">Bastard!</font>

1160
01:17:39,935 --> 01:17:41,537
<font color="#bafbfe">He's crazy.</font>

1161
01:17:41,938 --> 01:17:43,007
<font color="#bafbfe">Hit him again, Wendy.</font>

1162
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,083
<font color="#bafbfe"> Harder.</font>

1163
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:48,711
<font color="#bafbfe">Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?</font>

1164
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:51,030
<font color="#bafbfe">Because that's my name, you ape.</font>

1165
01:17:52,032 --> 01:17:53,744
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie was my sister.</font>

1166
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,716
<font color="#bafbfe">My twin sister.</font>

1167
01:17:56,493 --> 01:17:58,194
<font color="#bafbfe">I guess she was the nice one.</font>

1168
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:06,796
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie and the other six,</font>

1169
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,596
<font color="#bafbfe"> where are they?</font>

1170
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:10,265
<font color="#bafbfe">What did you do to them?</font>

1171
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:12,769
<font color="#bafbfe">You crazy goddamn broad.</font>

1172
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,270
<font color="#bafbfe">Just take a look at this mug.</font>

1173
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:19,167
<font color="#bafbfe">Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?</font>

1174
01:18:19,768 --> 01:18:20,994
<font color="#bafbfe">None of you would,</font>

1175
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,103
<font color="#bafbfe">but Goldie.</font>

1176
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,173
<font color="#bafbfe">And she only did because she
thought I could protect her.</font>

1177
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:30,774
<font color="#bafbfe">And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?</font>

1178
01:18:32,072 --> 01:18:34,328
<font color="#bafbfe">But as soon as they had
me for a fall guy,</font>

1179
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:36,796
<font color="#bafbfe">they showed up, guns blazing.</font>

1180
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:39,038
<font color="#bafbfe">But they didn't get me,</font>

1181
01:18:39,363 --> 01:18:42,184
<font color="#bafbfe">and I've been killing my way
to the truth ever since.</font>

1182
01:18:42,748 --> 01:18:44,301
<font color="#bafbfe">So, go ahead, doll.</font>

1183
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:47,685
<font color="#bafbfe">Shoot me now,</font>

1184
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,926
<font color="#bafbfe">or get the hell out of my way.</font>

1185
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,181
<font color="#bafbfe">Nuts.</font>

1186
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:03,283
<font color="#bafbfe">OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.</font>

1187
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:06,189
<font color="#bafbfe">What the hell?</font>

1188
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:07,264
<font color="#bafbfe">I tied those knots!</font>

1189
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,176
<font color="#bafbfe">That's my specialty.</font>

1190
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,033
<font color="#bafbfe">You sat there and took it,</font>

1191
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,462
<font color="#bafbfe">when you could've taken my gun
away any time you wanted to.</font>

1192
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:18,525
<font color="#bafbfe">Well, sure. I thought I might be
able to talk some sense into you.</font>

1193
01:19:19,327 --> 01:19:21,488
<font color="#bafbfe">And I probably would have
had to paste you one,</font>

1194
01:19:22,788 --> 01:19:23,890
<font color="#bafbfe">and I don't hurt girls.</font>

1195
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:26,908
<font color="#bafbfe">I need a pair of handcuffs.</font>

1196
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,369
<font color="#bafbfe">What style do you want?</font>

1197
01:19:28,395 --> 01:19:29,802
<font color="#bafbfe">I got a collection.</font>

1198
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,240
<font color="#bafbfe">Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.</font>

1199
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:37,185
<font color="#bafbfe">It was a farm boy named
Kevin who killed Goldie,</font>

1200
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:40,305
<font color="#bafbfe">but it was Cardinal Roark who was behind it,
and I don't know why.</font>

1201
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:42,350
<font color="#bafbfe">I know that sounds crazy.</font>

1202
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,421
<font color="#bafbfe">No, it doesn't.</font>

1203
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,152
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie worked the clergy.</font>

1204
01:19:46,729 --> 01:19:50,666
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just like that, a Whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.</i></font>

1205
01:19:51,367 --> 01:19:54,019
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm too dumb to put the
whole picture together yet but,</i></font>

1206
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:57,197
<font color="#ffff00"><i> she fires up two cigarettes
and hands me one,</i></font>

1207
01:19:57,198 --> 01:19:58,966
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I taste her lipstick on it,</i></font>

1208
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:02,779
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i></font>

1209
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:07,449
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I want to reach over and touch her and
taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i></font>

1210
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:09,659
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But she isn't Goldie.</i></font>

1211
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:12,246
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah, yeah. This'll do.</font>

1212
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:13,898
<font color="#bafbfe">Also I'm gonna be needing,</font>

1213
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:15,319
<font color="#bafbfe">a dozen two-foot lengths...</font>

1214
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:17,996
<font color="#bafbfe">of this rubber tubing.</font>

1215
01:20:19,136 --> 01:20:21,139
<font color="#bafbfe">And a spool of razor wire,</font>

1216
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,296
<font color="#bafbfe">and a pair of those special gloves,</font>

1217
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,492
<font color="#bafbfe">that'll let me handle the wire.</font>

1218
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:28,854
<font color="#bafbfe">Beefing up the old home security, huh?</font>

1219
01:20:29,855 --> 01:20:31,039
<font color="#bafbfe">You bet your ass.</font>

1220
01:20:31,841 --> 01:20:33,042
<font color="#bafbfe">She was my sister,</font>

1221
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:35,100
<font color="#bafbfe">so I'm in this one to the end.</font>

1222
01:20:35,778 --> 01:20:38,831
<font color="#bafbfe">Why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?</font>

1223
01:20:39,532 --> 01:20:40,684
<font color="#bafbfe">She was nice to me,</font>

1224
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,655
<font color="#bafbfe">gave me something
I didn't even know existed.</font>

1225
01:20:44,703 --> 01:20:46,356
<font color="#bafbfe">I wasn't never even able...</font>

1226
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:48,056
<font color="#bafbfe">buy a woman.</font>

1227
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,778
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah, the way I look.</font>

1228
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:56,297
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I take my mind off her and
I crawl back inside myself.</i></font>

1229
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:59,342
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i></font>

1230
01:20:59,844 --> 01:21:01,078
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I check the list,</i></font>

1231
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:03,962
<font color="#ffff00"><i>rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i></font>

1232
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:08,068
<font color="#ffff00"><i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i></font>

1233
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:10,304
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Gladys and my mitts.</i></font>

1234
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,462
<font color="#bafbfe">We're close enough. Pull over.</font>

1235
01:21:13,386 --> 01:21:14,529
<font color="#bafbfe">Yes, Marv.</font>

1236
01:21:15,777 --> 01:21:16,976
<font color="#bafbfe">Keep the engine running.</font>

1237
01:21:17,278 --> 01:21:19,140
<font color="#bafbfe">If I'm not back in 20 minutes,</font>

1238
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:21,738
<font color="#bafbfe">you get the hell outta
here and don't look back.</font>

1239
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:23,594
<font color="#bafbfe">Kill him for me, Marv.</font>

1240
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:27,488
<font color="#bafbfe">Kill him good.</font>

1241
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:30,088
<font color="#bafbfe">I won't let you down, Goldie.</font>

1242
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,016
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i></font>

1243
01:21:48,518 --> 01:21:50,448
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Getting himself a midnight snack,</i></font>

1244
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:52,542
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I can guess what kind.</i></font>

1245
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:08,997
<font color="#bafbfe">Come on, you son of a bitch.</font>

1246
01:22:09,997 --> 01:22:11,398
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Damn, he's slick.</i></font>

1247
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:26,224
<font color="#bafbfe">Is that the best you can do, creep?</font>

1248
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:31,625
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That's right. Get personal, get close.
I can take it.</i></font>

1249
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:36,970
<font color="#bafbfe">I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.</font>

1250
01:22:41,904 --> 01:22:45,904
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I try to slow my heart down and breathe
the fire out of my lungs.</i></font>

1251
01:22:46,908 --> 01:22:49,578
<font color="#ffff00"><i>My muscles make me a thousand
promises of pain to come.</i></font>

1252
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:51,859
<font color="#bafbfe">Let me do it, Marv.</font>

1253
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:54,222
<font color="#bafbfe">She was my sister.
Let me finish him.</font>

1254
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,627
<font color="#bafbfe">You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.</font>

1255
01:22:57,127 --> 01:22:58,421
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, but I want to...</font>

1256
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:03,559
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm sorry, kid, but I haven't even
started with this creep,</i></font>

1257
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,630
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i></font>

1258
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:11,341
<font color="#bafbfe">God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.</font>

1259
01:23:11,641 --> 01:23:14,270
<font color="#bafbfe">And it's not that fight of
ours that did me in, either.</font>

1260
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,372
<font color="#bafbfe">It's all that sawing and tying.</font>

1261
01:23:17,774 --> 01:23:19,609
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not as easy as it looks.</font>

1262
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:22,778
<font color="#bafbfe">Could have been a real mess around here,</font>

1263
01:23:22,801 --> 01:23:26,179
<font color="#bafbfe">if I didn't have that tubing
for tourniquets.</font>

1264
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:29,412
<font color="#bafbfe">I gotta admit,</font>

1265
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,003
<font color="#bafbfe">there was a spurt or two,</font>

1266
01:23:33,081 --> 01:23:34,595

1267
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,204

yours to come running.</font>

1268
01:23:42,047 --> 01:23:43,716
<font color="#bafbfe">Well, what do you know?</font>

1269
01:23:44,716 --> 01:23:45,960
<font color="#bafbfe">Look who's here.</font>

1270
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:51,261
<font color="#bafbfe">Here he comes.</font>

1271
01:23:55,645 --> 01:23:57,070
<font color="#bafbfe">That's a good dog.</font>

1272

all over the place.</i></font>

1275
01:24:05,113 --> 01:24:08,841
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i></font>

1276
01:24:09,242 --> 01:24:11,845
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i></font>

1277
01:24:13,246 --> 01:24:14,746
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He never screams.</i></font>

1278
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,203
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I put in a call to Kadie's and ask
Nancy to get her clothes on</i></font>

1279
01:24:22,505 --> 01:24:25,606
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and meet me at her place.
She says Yes like always.</i></font>

1280
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:28,135
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?</font>

1281
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:30,880
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, Marv. Who's the babe?</font>

1282
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,041
<font color="#ffff00"><i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i></font>

1283
01:24:34,641 --> 01:24:37,336
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Not since a year back when a
frat boy roughed her up</i></font>

1284
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:39,255
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and I straightened him out but good.</i></font>

1285
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:42,807
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It really gets my goat when
guys rough up dames.</i></font>

1286
01:24:43,332 --> 01:24:45,144
<font color="#bafbfe">What do you want me to do with her?</font>

1287
01:24:45,444 --> 01:24:47,029
<font color="#bafbfe">Well, your best bet is...</font>

1288
01:24:47,354 --> 01:24:49,280
<font color="#bafbfe">drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.</font>

1289
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:51,237
<font color="#bafbfe">What about you?</font>

1290
01:24:51,561 --> 01:24:52,850
<font color="#bafbfe">Are you leaving town?</font>

1291
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:54,528
<font color="#bafbfe">Hell, no.</font>

1292
01:24:54,752 --> 01:24:55,988
<font color="#bafbfe">I like it here.</font>

1293
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:02,077
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i></font>

1294
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,695
<font color="#ffff00"><i>so as not to get any attention.</i></font>

1295
01:25:04,296 --> 01:25:07,932
<font color="#ffff00"><i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i></font>

1296
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:09,894
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I owe you, Goldie.</i></font>

1297
01:25:10,595 --> 01:25:12,354
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i></font>

1298
01:25:13,055 --> 01:25:15,640
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So, if going after Roark means dying,
win or lose,</i></font>

1299
01:25:16,141 --> 01:25:20,141
<font color="#ffff00"><i>hell, I'll die laughing if I know
I've done this one thing right.</i></font>

1300
01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:26,496
<font color="#bafbfe">Quiet as a grave out here.</font>

1301
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,527
<font color="#bafbfe">No sign of target.</font>

1302
01:25:27,904 --> 01:25:29,104
<font color="#bafbfe"><i>All right, keep a lookout.</i></font>

1303
01:25:46,588 --> 01:25:47,588
<font color="#bafbfe">Kevin?</font>

1304
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:49,113
<font color="#bafbfe">What's left of him, anyways.</font>

1305
01:25:51,594 --> 01:25:52,993
<font color="#bafbfe">The dog ate the rest.</font>

1306
01:26:00,895 --> 01:26:02,104
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, my God.</font>

1307
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:04,713
<font color="#bafbfe">You monster.</font>

1308
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,725
<font color="#bafbfe">You demon.</font>

1309
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:09,970
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't scream or I'll plug you.</font>

1310
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:13,565
<font color="#bafbfe">He had the voice of an angel,</font>

1311
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:15,895
<font color="#bafbfe">yet he spoke only to me.</font>

1312
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:20,189
<font color="#bafbfe">And he's dead now because
of one stupid whore.</font>

1313
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:24,472
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not a real good idea for you
to talk about Goldie that way,</font>

1314
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:25,710
<font color="#bafbfe">while I'm around.</font>

1315
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:27,898
<font color="#bafbfe">When he came to me...</font>

1316
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:32,168
<font color="#bafbfe">he was a tormented boy.</font>

1317
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:36,238
<font color="#bafbfe">Tormented by guilt.</font>

1318
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,460
<font color="#bafbfe">I tried to counsel him.</font>

1319
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,349
<font color="#bafbfe">But the eating,</font>

1320
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:45,905
<font color="#bafbfe">it filled him with white light.</font>

1321
01:26:46,481 --> 01:26:50,481
<font color="#bafbfe">Tearful, he swore to me that he
felt the touch of God Almighty.</font>

1322
01:26:52,488 --> 01:26:54,256
<font color="#bafbfe">What the hell do you know?</font>

1323
01:26:54,657 --> 01:26:56,684
<font color="#bafbfe">I know it's pretty damn weird
to eat people.</font>

1324
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:59,699
<font color="#bafbfe">He didn't just eat their bodies,</font>

1325
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:01,809
<font color="#bafbfe">he ate their souls.</font>

1326
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,100
<font color="#bafbfe">And I joined in.</font>

1327
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:12,007
<font color="#bafbfe">They were all whores.</font>

1328
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:14,806
<font color="#bafbfe">Nobody cared for them.</font>

1329
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,502
<font color="#bafbfe">Nobody missed them.</font>

1330
01:27:17,179 --> 01:27:18,458
<font color="#bafbfe">And then your...</font>

1331
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:22,103
<font color="#bafbfe">Goldie almost ruined everything.</font>

1332
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:24,502
<font color="#bafbfe">She stayed in public places.</font>

1333
01:27:25,104 --> 01:27:26,447
<font color="#bafbfe">And then with you.</font>

1334
01:27:27,648 --> 01:27:28,981
<font color="#bafbfe">You were so convenient.</font>

1335
01:27:28,983 --> 01:27:31,659
<font color="#bafbfe">You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</font>

1336
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,387
<font color="#bafbfe">Who would believe a thug like you?</font>

1337
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:36,355
<font color="#bafbfe">Kevin killed her.</font>

1338
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:38,122
<font color="#bafbfe">I ordered the police in for you,</font>

1339
01:27:38,347 --> 01:27:39,975
<font color="#bafbfe">but you wouldn't be caught.</font>

1340
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:41,795
<font color="#bafbfe">You wouldn't stop.</font>

1341
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:44,265
<font color="#bafbfe">And now he's dead and you're here to...</font>

1342
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:47,760
<font color="#bafbfe">eliminate me.</font>

1343
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:52,060
<font color="#bafbfe">Will that give you satisfaction, my son?</font>

1344
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,497
<font color="#bafbfe">Killing a helpless,</font>

1345
01:27:56,922 --> 01:27:57,974
<font color="#bafbfe">old...</font>

1346
01:27:58,198 --> 01:27:59,198
<font color="#bafbfe"> fart?</font>

1347
01:28:00,555 --> 01:28:01,789
<font color="#bafbfe">The killing, no.</font>

1348
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,534
<font color="#bafbfe">No satisfaction.</font>

1349
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:07,859
<font color="#bafbfe">Everything up until the killing,</font>

1350
01:28:08,684 --> 01:28:09,859
<font color="#bafbfe">will be a gas.</font>

1351
01:28:13,234 --> 01:28:14,329
<font color="#bafbfe">Kevin...</font>

1352
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:18,831
<font color="#bafbfe">we're going home.</font>

1353
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:24,770
<font color="#bafbfe">You can scream now if you want to.</font>

1354

the hell I sent him to</i></font>

1357

<font color="#ffff00"><i>must seem like heaven after
what I've done to him.</i></font>

1358
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,701
<font color="#bafbfe">Freeze! Oh, my God!</font>

1359
01:28:55,326 --> 01:28:56,377
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Jerks.</i></font>

1360
01:28:56,779 --> 01:29:00,148

and enough times to make sure.</i></font>

1361
01:29:00,448 --> 01:29:02,149
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's so stupid.</i></font>

1362
01:29:02,451 --> 01:29:04,261
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Everybody knows what's coming,</i></font>

1363
01:29:04,462 --> 01:29:06,595
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but they go through
the motions anyway.</i></font>

1364
01:29:06,596 --> 01:29:08,023
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What a waste of time.</i></font>

1365

be so easy as that.</i></font>

1371
01:29:28,894 --> 01:29:33,239
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They just keep knocking the crap out of me
and waving a confession in my face.</i></font>

1372

<font color="#ffff00"><i>And I keep spitting
blood all over it</i></font>

assistant district attorney</i></font>

01:37:12,064 --> 01:37:14,667
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't believe you're doing this to me, Shellie.</font>

1415
01:37:15,569 --> 01:37:17,033
<font color="#bafbfe">Everything we've shared,</font>

1416
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,871
<font color="#bafbfe">It has to mean something to you.</font>

1417
01:37:20,547 --> 01:37:21,960
<font color="#bafbfe">It meant plenty.</font>

1418
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:24,100
<font color="#bafbfe">Plenty of lost pay on account
of how nobody wants</font>

1419
01:37:24,101 --> 01:37:27,729
<font color="#bafbfe">to flirt with a waitress whose face is
all purple and swollen up with bruises.</font>

1420
01:37:27,831 --> 01:37:29,423
<font color="#bafbfe">I know you're angry, baby.</font>

1421
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,292
<font color="#bafbfe">I forgive you for that without you asking me to.</font>

1422
01:37:32,293 --> 01:37:36,247
<font color="#bafbfe">There's a difference between getting
honked off at a guy who's not so bad,</font>

1423
01:37:36,347 --> 01:37:40,792
<font color="#bafbfe">and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser</font>

1424
01:37:40,793 --> 01:37:43,054
<font color="#bafbfe">who skips out on a wife he
doesn't even tell you about</font>

1425
01:37:43,454 --> 01:37:45,731
<font color="#bafbfe">every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!</font>

1426
01:37:46,432 --> 01:37:48,967
<font color="#bafbfe">Especially the kind of total jerk loser</font>

1427
01:37:49,269 --> 01:37:52,137
<font color="#bafbfe">who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.</font>

1428
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:54,032
<font color="#bafbfe">That hurt, Shellie.</font>

1429
01:37:54,733 --> 01:37:57,327
<font color="#bafbfe">It's one thing for you to play hard to get,</font>

1430
01:37:58,028 --> 01:38:00,145
<font color="#bafbfe">but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.</font>

1431
01:38:00,447 --> 01:38:03,032
<font color="#bafbfe">I am impossible to get.</font>

1432
01:38:03,033 --> 01:38:04,997
<font color="#bafbfe">Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,</font>

1433
01:38:05,122 --> 01:38:06,025
<font color="#bafbfe">and get help,</font>

1434
01:38:06,302 --> 01:38:08,354
<font color="#bafbfe">like... a shrink.</font>

1435
01:38:09,456 --> 01:38:10,538
<font color="#bafbfe">Get help and...</font>

1436
01:38:11,463 --> 01:38:12,740
<font color="#bafbfe">get lost.</font>

1437
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:14,193
<font color="#bafbfe">Open the door.</font>

1438
01:38:14,293 --> 01:38:16,054
<font color="#bafbfe">Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.</font>

1439
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:18,838
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll take care of this.</font>

1440
01:38:19,216 --> 01:38:22,916
<font color="#bafbfe">Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.</font>

1441
01:38:24,971 --> 01:38:26,113
<font color="#bafbfe">Oblige him, Shellie.</font>

1442
01:38:26,637 --> 01:38:28,314
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm ready for him.</font>

1443
01:38:28,391 --> 01:38:30,467
<font color="#bafbfe">No! If he knew that you were here with me,</font>

1444
01:38:30,769 --> 01:38:34,323
<font color="#bafbfe">you don't know how bad this could get!
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.</font>

1445
01:38:35,524 --> 01:38:38,100
<font color="#bafbfe">He's got four friends
out there in the hall,</font>

1446
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,211
<font color="#bafbfe">breathing hard and just as drunk as he is.</font>

1447
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:45,712
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.</font>

1448
01:38:45,742 --> 01:38:46,742
<font color="#bafbfe">Somebody!</font>

1449
01:38:46,766 --> 01:38:51,488
<font color="#bafbfe">Jackie Boy, it's a regular
African love fest in here!</font>

1450
01:38:51,489 --> 01:38:54,158
<font color="#bafbfe">I mean, I got. I got me all five starters,
I'm no racist.</font>

1451
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,612
<font color="#bafbfe">half the bench of the Basin
City Blues keeping me company.</font>

1452
01:38:58,212 --> 01:38:59,422
<font color="#bafbfe">You feel like taking them on?</font>

1453
01:39:00,423 --> 01:39:02,609
<font color="#bafbfe">You are teasing me, baby.</font>

1454
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:05,520
<font color="#bafbfe">Some of my best friends...</font>

1455
01:39:07,221 --> 01:39:09,356
<font color="#bafbfe">But you're really pushing my buttons.</font>

1456
01:39:09,557 --> 01:39:12,025
<font color="#bafbfe">And the whole time you've
been doing me like this,</font>

1457
01:39:12,226 --> 01:39:15,171
<font color="#bafbfe">I've been too polite to point
out that any time I want to,</font>

1458
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:17,399
<font color="#bafbfe">I could kick this damn door to splinters.</font>

1459
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:20,568
<font color="#bafbfe">OK, baby, you know what I can do.</font>

1460
01:39:21,469 --> 01:39:22,409
<font color="#bafbfe">You know what I can do.</font>

1461
01:39:22,435 --> 01:39:23,662
<font color="#bafbfe">All right, then!
One, two...</font>

1462
01:39:23,738 --> 01:39:26,038
<font color="#bafbfe">All right. All right, all right!</font>

1463
01:39:29,493 --> 01:39:32,394
<font color="#bafbfe">Troops, make yourself at home.</font>

1464
01:39:41,631 --> 01:39:43,125
<font color="#bafbfe">You brought your whole pack with you?</font>

1465
01:39:44,426 --> 01:39:47,636
<font color="#bafbfe">None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?</font>

1466
01:39:47,636 --> 01:39:49,104
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna love this, baby.</font>

1467
01:39:49,305 --> 01:39:51,966
<font color="#bafbfe">You're gonna call up some of
your friends who work the saloon.</font>

1468
01:39:52,266 --> 01:39:55,470
<font color="#bafbfe">With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,</font>

1469
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,016
<font color="#bafbfe">and it's gonna be great.</font>

1470
01:39:57,641 --> 01:39:59,295
<font color="#bafbfe">I aingt calling up nobody.</font>

1471
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:06,039
<font color="#bafbfe">That's a man's shirt,</font>

1472
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:08,864
<font color="#bafbfe">and I'm sure as hell
it aingt one of mine.</font>

1473
01:40:09,242 --> 01:40:12,320
<font color="#bafbfe">You got somebody's love
stink all over you.</font>

1474
01:40:13,622 --> 01:40:17,082
<font color="#bafbfe">You've been with another man and
you've been with him tonight.</font>

1475
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:19,427
<font color="#bafbfe">Who is he?
He's Superman.</font>

1476
01:40:20,628 --> 01:40:23,756
<font color="#bafbfe">He flew out the window just as
soon as he heard you were coming,</font>

1477
01:40:24,757 --> 01:40:26,944
<font color="#bafbfe">'cause you scared him so bad.</font>

1478
01:40:29,345 --> 01:40:32,431
<font color="#bafbfe">You think I have no feelings at all.</font>

1479
01:40:33,432 --> 01:40:34,943
<font color="#bafbfe">If you're gonna slug me,</font>

1480
01:40:35,644 --> 01:40:38,570
<font color="#bafbfe">just go ahead and get it over
with, you sick bastard.</font>

1481
01:40:38,771 --> 01:40:41,942
<font color="#bafbfe">There you go, lying about me again,</font>

1482
01:40:42,943 --> 01:40:44,778
<font color="#bafbfe">right in front of my friends.</font>

1483
01:40:45,779 --> 01:40:48,481
<font color="#bafbfe">I have never hit a woman in my life.</font>

1484
01:40:54,703 --> 01:40:55,913
<font color="#bafbfe">That's showing her, man.</font>

1485
01:40:56,914 --> 01:40:58,387
<font color="#bafbfe">You goddamn bastard.</font>

1486
01:40:59,113 --> 01:41:01,085
<font color="#bafbfe">You goddamn coward.</font>

1487
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:03,688
<font color="#bafbfe">Baby, we're here to have a good time.
Yeah.</font>

1488
01:41:04,588 --> 01:41:05,766
<font color="#bafbfe">I gotta take a leak.</font>

1489
01:41:08,467 --> 01:41:10,386
<font color="#bafbfe">Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.</font>

1490
01:41:10,886 --> 01:41:12,681
<font color="#bafbfe">Then you could've met my boyfriend.</font>

1491
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:16,868
<font color="#bafbfe">Could've seen what a real man looks like.</font>

1492
01:41:17,269 --> 01:41:20,146
<font color="#bafbfe">There you go, after my nuts again.</font>

1493
01:41:21,148 --> 01:41:22,381
<font color="#bafbfe">But I forgive you.</font>

1494
01:41:23,483 --> 01:41:24,609
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm a generous guy.</font>

1495
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:26,907
<font color="#bafbfe">He is generous.</font>

1496
01:41:27,332 --> 01:41:29,579
<font color="#bafbfe">But that temper of his...</font>

1497
01:41:30,157 --> 01:41:32,576
<font color="#bafbfe">You never should have
picked on him like you did.</font>

1498
01:41:33,577 --> 01:41:36,087
<font color="#bafbfe">My temper you don't have to worry about.</font>

1499
01:41:36,787 --> 01:41:40,387
<font color="#bafbfe">Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.</font>

1500
01:41:41,792 --> 01:41:43,494
<font color="#bafbfe">I've been told.</font>

1501
01:41:44,796 --> 01:41:47,523
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, you don't wanna be hitting
the streets dressed like that honey.</font>

1502
01:41:47,923 --> 01:41:49,238
<font color="#bafbfe">It's a jungle out there.</font>

1503
01:41:49,663 --> 01:41:52,847
<font color="#bafbfe">Besides, you got a couple of phone
calls you ought to be making.</font>

1504
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,621
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey, baby, I don't hear
you making those calls.</font>

1505
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:03,582
<font color="#bafbfe">Answer me!</font>

1506
01:42:04,983 --> 01:42:06,525
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, I don't need this grief.</font>

1507
01:42:07,027 --> 01:42:08,027
<font color="#bafbfe">Hi.</font>

1508
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:11,451
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.</font>

1509
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:15,380
<font color="#bafbfe">You ever so much as talk
to Shellie again,</font>

1510
01:42:15,604 --> 01:42:17,261
<font color="#bafbfe">you even think her name,</font>

1511
01:42:18,037 --> 01:42:20,948
<font color="#bafbfe">and I'll cut you in ways that'll
make you useless to a woman.</font>

1512
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:24,210
<font color="#bafbfe">You're making a big mistake, man.</font>

1513
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:26,019
<font color="#bafbfe">A big mistake.</font>

1514
01:42:26,296 --> 01:42:27,296
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah?</font>

1515
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,819
<font color="#bafbfe">You already made a big mistake yourself.</font>

1516
01:42:31,717 --> 01:42:33,413
<font color="#bafbfe">You didn't flush.</font>

1517
01:43:27,023 --> 01:43:28,815
<font color="#bafbfe">Troops, get outta here.</font>

1518
01:43:29,317 --> 01:43:31,817
<font color="#bafbfe">No questions, damn it.
No questions. Now!</font>

1519
01:43:51,922 --> 01:43:53,733
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?</font>

1520
01:43:54,134 --> 01:43:56,293
<font color="#bafbfe">I just gave him a taste
of his own medicine.</font>

1521
01:43:57,095 --> 01:43:58,470
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't think he'll be bothering you again.</font>

1522
01:43:59,471 --> 01:44:00,734
<font color="#bafbfe">How's your jaw?</font>

1523
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:02,899
<font color="#bafbfe">I've been slapped around worse.</font>

1524
01:44:03,475 --> 01:44:04,226
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight,</font>

1525
01:44:05,652 --> 01:44:07,103
<font color="#bafbfe">he was from a while back,</font>

1526
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:09,841
<font color="#bafbfe">before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.</font>

1527
01:44:10,942 --> 01:44:13,377
<font color="#bafbfe">And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.</font>

1528
01:44:14,779 --> 01:44:16,038
<font color="#bafbfe">And it was only once.</font>

1529
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:18,998
<font color="#bafbfe">I've done some dumb things.</font>

1530
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,310
<font color="#bafbfe">Seeing how I'm one of those dumb things,</font>

1531
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:23,662
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't give you too hard
a time about that, Shellie.</font>

1532
01:44:24,163 --> 01:44:25,512
<font color="#bafbfe">But this guy,</font>

1533
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:27,623
<font color="#bafbfe">he's a menace.</font>

1534
01:44:28,501 --> 01:44:30,497
<font color="#bafbfe">He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.</font>

1535
01:44:33,297 --> 01:44:34,661
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll call you later.</font>

1536
01:44:34,886 --> 01:44:36,056
<font color="#bafbfe">No, don't go!</font>

1537
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:39,110
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Shellie shouts something I can't make out</i></font>

1538
01:44:39,112 --> 01:44:40,979
<font color="#ffff00"><i>over the racket of
a passing police 'copter.</i></font>

1539
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,631
<font color="#bafbfe">Stop!</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It sounds like stop,</i></font>

1540
01:44:43,932 --> 01:44:45,296
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but I can't be sure.</i></font>

1541
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:47,786
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,</i></font>

1542
01:44:47,886 --> 01:44:49,771
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but I can't go home and forget about it,</i></font>

1543
01:44:49,773 --> 01:44:52,091
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and let Jackie Boy and his
pals find their fun.</i></font>

1544
01:44:53,193 --> 01:44:54,899
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They're a pack of predators,</i></font>

1545
01:44:55,001 --> 01:44:56,729
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and they're out for blood tonight,</i></font>

1546
01:44:57,554 --> 01:44:58,841
<font color="#ffff00"><i>a woman's blood.</i></font>

1547
01:44:58,864 --> 01:45:00,768
<font color="#bafbfe">Damn it, Dwight. Damn it.</font>

1548
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:03,371
<font color="#bafbfe">You fool.</font>

1549
01:45:05,372 --> 01:45:06,823
<font color="#bafbfe">You damned fool.</font>

1550
01:45:07,623 --> 01:45:09,649
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i></font>

1551
01:45:09,673 --> 01:45:12,311
<font color="#ffff00"><i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i></font>

1552
01:45:13,212 --> 01:45:14,230

1553
01:45:14,956 --> 01:45:17,007
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.</i></font>

1554
01:45:17,884 --> 01:45:21,595
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If you're a murderer with a new face
who's one fingerprint check away</i></font>

1555
01:45:21,595 --> 01:45:23,855
<font color="#ffff00"><i>from the fast track to the
gas chamber like I am,</i></font>

1556
01:45:24,556 --> 01:45:26,685
<font color="#ffff00"><i>the last thing you want is to get noticed.</i></font>

1557
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:31,889
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't have nearly enough
cash on me to bribe this cop,</i></font>

1558
01:45:32,014 --> 01:45:33,189
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and even if I did,</i></font>

1559
01:45:33,565 --> 01:45:36,234
<font color="#ffff00"><i>there's the outside chance he's
one of the honest ones.</i></font>

1560
01:45:36,735 --> 01:45:38,563
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,</i></font>

1561
01:45:38,887 --> 01:45:41,560
<font color="#ffff00"><i>or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i></font>

1562
01:45:42,742 --> 01:45:46,545
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then Jackie Boy saves me a great, big,
steaming pile of trouble.</i></font>

1563
01:45:46,746 --> 01:45:48,215
<font color="#bafbfe">Watch it, Jack!</font>

1564
01:45:55,546 --> 01:45:57,222
<font color="#bafbfe">Cops! They're right on our ass!</font>

1565
01:45:57,423 --> 01:45:58,652
<font color="#bafbfe">Not for long.</font>

1566
01:45:59,176 --> 01:46:00,667
<font color="#bafbfe">Not where we're headed.</font>

1567
01:46:00,844 --> 01:46:02,371
<font color="#ffff00"><i>My gut tightens up.</i></font>

1568
01:46:03,971 --> 01:46:07,471
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i></font>

1569
01:46:10,895 --> 01:46:11,813
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i></font>

1570
01:46:12,814 --> 01:46:14,225
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He knows he's not the law,</i></font>

1571
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:15,373
<font color="#ffff00"><i>not in Old Town.</i></font>

1572
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:17,859
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The ladies are the law here,</i></font>

1573
01:46:18,185 --> 01:46:19,670
<font color="#ffff00"><i>beautiful and merciless.</i></font>

1574
01:46:20,447 --> 01:46:22,855
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If you've got cash and play by the rules,</i></font>

1575
01:46:22,856 --> 01:46:24,278
<font color="#ffff00"><i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i></font>

1576
01:46:24,603 --> 01:46:26,091
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But if you cross them,</i></font>

1577
01:46:26,769 --> 01:46:27,929
<font color="#ffff00"><i>you're a corpse.</i></font>

1578
01:46:28,829 --> 01:46:30,572
<font color="#bafbfe">Squad car's long gone.</font>

1579
01:46:30,997 --> 01:46:32,533
<font color="#bafbfe">I called it. Was I right?</font>

1580
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:35,117
<font color="#bafbfe">You're always right, Jack.</font>

1581
01:46:35,242 --> 01:46:37,434
<font color="#bafbfe">None of us ever doubted
you for a second.</font>

1582
01:46:39,298 --> 01:46:40,801
<font color="#bafbfe">But I heard things about these girls.</font>

1583
01:46:42,301 --> 01:46:44,545
<font color="#bafbfe">Things they'd done
to guys who got out of line.</font>

1584
01:46:44,845 --> 01:46:45,945
<font color="#bafbfe">Who's out of line?</font>

1585
01:46:53,563 --> 01:46:55,462
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey, baby. Hey, baby.</font>

1586
01:46:58,943 --> 01:47:00,853
<font color="#bafbfe">Hop in, sugar. We'll get you there.</font>

1587
01:47:01,154 --> 01:47:05,573
<font color="#bafbfe">Aw, sweetheart, I work the day
shift and it's been a long day.</font>

1588
01:47:06,074 --> 01:47:08,386
<font color="#bafbfe">Besides, I don't do group jobs.</font>

1589
01:47:09,787 --> 01:47:10,877
<font color="#bafbfe">Get in the car, baby.</font>

1590
01:47:10,903 --> 01:47:12,613
<font color="#bafbfe">We'll just talk. It'll be nice.</font>

1591
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:14,900
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't do talk jobs, either.</font>

1592
01:47:15,502 --> 01:47:16,502
<font color="#bafbfe">Baby doll,</font>

1593
01:47:16,726 --> 01:47:19,725
<font color="#bafbfe">I've had me one hell of a bad day.</font>

1594
01:47:20,672 --> 01:47:23,426
<font color="#bafbfe">I've been beat up every time I turn around.</font>

1595
01:47:24,426 --> 01:47:26,636
<font color="#bafbfe">But the day I get turned down by a hooker</font>

1596
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:29,181
<font color="#bafbfe">when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with,</font>

1597
01:47:30,182 --> 01:47:31,182
<font color="#bafbfe">well,</font>

1598
01:47:32,707 --> 01:47:34,606
<font color="#bafbfe">there's only so much a man can take.</font>

1599
01:47:35,354 --> 01:47:37,564
<font color="#bafbfe">Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.</font>

1600
01:47:37,564 --> 01:47:39,725
<font color="#bafbfe">That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.</font>

1601
01:47:40,025 --> 01:47:41,711
<font color="#bafbfe">The Amigo's a fag joint.</font>

1602
01:47:42,612 --> 01:47:46,657
<font color="#bafbfe">Are you having a good time
humiliating me like this</font>

1603
01:47:46,658 --> 01:47:49,603
<font color="#bafbfe">for no damn reason at all?</font>

1604
01:47:51,203 --> 01:47:52,614
<font color="#bafbfe">That's far enough, Dwight.</font>

1605
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:54,671
<font color="#bafbfe">We've been on top
of these peckervvoods</font>

1606
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:56,576
<font color="#bafbfe">since they showed up with
that cop behind them.</font>

1607
01:47:57,377 --> 01:47:58,945
<font color="#bafbfe">Everything's under control.</font>

1608
01:48:00,546 --> 01:48:01,672
<font color="#bafbfe">Enjoy the show.</font>

1609
01:48:02,673 --> 01:48:04,716
<font color="#ffff00"><i>There's no use arguing with her.</i></font>

1610
01:48:05,717 --> 01:48:07,779
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i></font>

1611
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,822
<font color="#bafbfe">So how's the barmaid?</font>

1612
01:48:10,122 --> 01:48:11,488
<font color="#bafbfe">You know, the one
that never shuts up?</font>

1613
01:48:11,765 --> 01:48:13,060
<font color="#bafbfe">Not right now, Gail.</font>

1614
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,529
<font color="#bafbfe">Wound up a little tight, aren't we?</font>

1615
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:18,734
<font color="#bafbfe">That's your whole problem, Dwight.</font>

1616
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:20,289
<font color="#bafbfe">You worry too much.</font>

1617
01:48:21,067 --> 01:48:22,448
<font color="#bafbfe">That, and your lousy taste in women.</font>

1618
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:24,018
<font color="#bafbfe">These days, anyway.</font>

1619
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:26,255
<font color="#bafbfe">Damn it, Gail. Not right now.</font>

1620
01:48:27,155 --> 01:48:28,372
<font color="#bafbfe">Those clowns down the way,</font>

1621
01:48:29,096 --> 01:48:30,966
<font color="#bafbfe">they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?</font>

1622
01:48:31,243 --> 01:48:32,412
<font color="#bafbfe">One of them thinks he is.</font>

1623
01:48:33,412 --> 01:48:34,538
<font color="#bafbfe">He's outta control.</font>

1624
01:48:35,539 --> 01:48:38,042
<font color="#bafbfe">I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.</font>

1625
01:48:39,042 --> 01:48:40,654
<font color="#bafbfe">Us helpless little girls.</font>

1626
01:48:43,256 --> 01:48:46,426
<font color="#ffff00"><i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i></font>

1627
01:48:47,426 --> 01:48:49,854
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i></font>

1628
01:48:51,055 --> 01:48:52,923
<font color="#bafbfe">Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.</font>

1629
01:48:53,725 --> 01:48:55,792
<font color="#bafbfe">Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away</font>

1630
01:48:56,394 --> 01:48:57,737
<font color="#bafbfe">from seeing what Miho can do.</font>

1631
01:48:58,938 --> 01:49:01,637
<font color="#bafbfe">And she's been aching for some practice.</font>

1632
01:49:03,943 --> 01:49:07,639
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i></font>

1633
01:49:08,739 --> 01:49:10,052
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Deadly little Miho.</i></font>

1634
01:49:10,278 --> 01:49:12,192
<font color="#ffff00">You're running out of alley, cowboy.</font>

1635
01:49:13,368 --> 01:49:14,365
<font color="#ffff00">Turn around.</font>

1636
01:49:14,791 --> 01:49:16,880
<font color="#ffff00">Save yourself and your
buddies a ton of grief.</font>

1637
01:49:17,457 --> 01:49:18,957
<font color="#bafbfe">You're a sassy little thing.</font>

1638
01:49:19,958 --> 01:49:23,559
<font color="#bafbfe">You aingt hardly in any kind of
position to be making threats.</font>

1639
01:49:25,088 --> 01:49:28,417
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The trap is set, locked and ready to spring.</i></font>

1640
01:49:29,217 --> 01:49:32,329
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i></font>

1641
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:36,141
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i></font>

1642
01:49:36,443 --> 01:49:38,237
<font color="#bafbfe">They haven't killed anybody I know about.</font>

1643
01:49:39,738 --> 01:49:41,734
<font color="#bafbfe">It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,</font>

1644
01:49:41,859 --> 01:49:43,715
<font color="#bafbfe">but they didn't kill anybody.</font>

1645
01:49:44,692 --> 01:49:45,792
<font color="#bafbfe">And they won't.</font>

1646
01:49:46,194 --> 01:49:47,403
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Why this rotten feeling?</i></font>

1647
01:49:48,404 --> 01:49:51,282
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i></font>

1648
01:49:51,783 --> 01:49:55,177
<font color="#bafbfe">OK, OK, OK. I sounded off a
little more than I should have.</font>

1649
01:49:56,078 --> 01:49:58,764
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm a little on edge.
Over the edge.</font>

1650
01:49:59,164 --> 01:50:01,859
<font color="#bafbfe">It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.</font>

1651
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:04,996
<font color="#bafbfe">You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.</font>

1652
01:50:06,296 --> 01:50:08,539
<font color="#bafbfe">She's saying you aingt got
what it takes, Jack.</font>

1653
01:50:11,511 --> 01:50:12,804
<font color="#bafbfe">You wanna see it?</font>

1654
01:50:14,305 --> 01:50:15,817
<font color="#bafbfe">You wanna see what I got?</font>

1655
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:21,079
<font color="#bafbfe">I've seen all shapes, all sizes.</font>

1656
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,600
<font color="#bafbfe">You seen this one?</font>

1657
01:50:27,402 --> 01:50:28,377
<font color="#bafbfe">Get in the car.</font>

1658
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:29,978
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, sugar,</font>

1659
01:50:30,703 --> 01:50:33,202
<font color="#bafbfe">you just gone and done the dumbest
thing in your whole life.</font>

1660
01:50:51,009 --> 01:50:52,086
<font color="#bafbfe">Oh, God, no!</font>

1661
01:50:54,386 --> 01:50:55,662
<font color="#bafbfe">This is crazy!</font>

1662
01:50:56,764 --> 01:50:59,463
<font color="#bafbfe">Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!</font>

1663
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:07,963
<font color="#bafbfe">Go ahead.</font>

1664
01:51:08,488 --> 01:51:09,777
<font color="#bafbfe">Go ahead. Go ahead.</font>

1665
01:51:11,654 --> 01:51:13,639
<font color="#bafbfe">He's got the drop on her.
He's got squat.</font>

1666
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,939
<font color="#bafbfe">He's dead. He's just too
damn dumb to know it.</font>

1667
01:51:20,872 --> 01:51:23,250
<font color="#bafbfe">I got you right where I want you.</font>

1668
01:51:24,751 --> 01:51:27,418
<font color="#bafbfe">This is a career-ending wound, whore.</font>

1669
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,979
<font color="#bafbfe">And there's gonna be hell to pay.</font>

1670
01:51:30,104 --> 01:51:31,743
<font color="#bafbfe">Watch your step, Jackie Boy.</font>

1671
01:51:43,603 --> 01:51:44,837
<font color="#bafbfe">This isn't funny.</font>

1672
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:49,667
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.</font>

1673
01:51:50,068 --> 01:51:52,171
<font color="#bafbfe">Every one of you is gonna burn.</font>

1674
01:51:54,072 --> 01:51:56,064
<font color="#bafbfe">Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.</font>

1675
01:51:56,564 --> 01:51:58,976
<font color="#bafbfe">You're only making it worse.
You shut the hell up.</font>

1676
01:52:00,578 --> 01:52:02,947
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.</font>

1677
01:52:04,247 --> 01:52:06,948
<font color="#bafbfe">I told you to shut up.</font>

1678
01:52:13,048 --> 01:52:14,225
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't see.</font>

1679
01:52:15,426 --> 01:52:16,511
<font color="#bafbfe">What's happening?</font>

1680
01:52:19,012 --> 01:52:20,172
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't see.</font>

1681
01:52:21,474 --> 01:52:23,009
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't hear anything.</font>

1682
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:26,613
<font color="#bafbfe">For God's sake, Miho, finish him.</font>

1683
01:52:27,814 --> 01:52:30,413
<font color="#bafbfe">Yeah. Make it quick, will you?</font>

1684
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,161
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i></font>

1685
01:52:38,908 --> 01:52:41,707
<font color="#ffff00"><i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i></font>

1686
01:52:43,912 --> 01:52:45,305
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Then it's straight to business</i></font>

1687
01:52:45,706 --> 01:52:49,068
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Stretching corpses out on the floor and
going through their pockets,</i></font>

<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, he's dead.</font>

1832
02:00:45,269 --> 02:00:47,680
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.</font>

1833
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:52,208
<font color="#bafbfe">None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.</font>

1834
02:00:53,109 --> 02:00:55,554
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't have a chance in
hell of outrunning this cop.</font>

1835
02:00:56,654 --> 02:00:57,948
<font color="#bafbfe">Not in this heap.</font>

1836
02:00:58,948 --> 02:01:00,194
<font color="#bafbfe">Pull over!</font>

1837
02:01:02,994 --> 02:01:05,881
<font color="#bafbfe">The only question left is whether
I'm gonna kill him or not.</font>

1838
02:01:06,582 --> 02:01:07,824
<font color="#bafbfe">Tough call.</font>

1839
02:01:09,126 --> 02:01:11,377
<font color="#bafbfe">For all I know, he's an honest cop,
regular guy,</font>

1840
02:01:12,378 --> 02:01:15,073
<font color="#bafbfe">a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.</font>

1841
02:01:16,675 --> 02:01:18,310
<font color="#bafbfe">My hand moves all on its own,</font>

1842
02:01:19,011 --> 02:01:22,110
<font color="#bafbfe">sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.</font>

1843
02:01:25,225 --> 02:01:26,498
<font color="#bafbfe">I don't know what to do.</font>

1844
02:01:26,523 --> 02:01:29,048
<font color="#bafbfe"> You better stop.
You're making him mad.</font>

1845
02:01:31,606 --> 02:01:33,106
<font color="#bafbfe">Whatever you say.</font>

1846
02:01:41,492 --> 02:01:44,891
<font color="#bafbfe">Your friend here,
party a little too hard tonight?</font>

1847
02:01:46,704 --> 02:01:48,505
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm the designated driver.</font>

1848
02:01:55,213 --> 02:01:57,113
<font color="#bafbfe">Well, you're driving
with a busted tail light.</font>

1849
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,980
<font color="#bafbfe">I'll let you off with a warning.</font>

1850
02:02:13,564 --> 02:02:14,524
<font color="#bafbfe">What next?</font>

1851
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:22,975
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The tank goes dry a quarter
mile from the pits.</i></font>

1852
02:02:24,076 --> 02:02:26,203
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i></font>

1853
02:02:27,203 --> 02:02:29,581
<font color="#ffff00"><i>A few minutes' more work and
it'll all be over.</i></font>

1854
02:02:30,582 --> 02:02:33,042
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits,</i></font>

1855
02:02:34,043 --> 02:02:38,043
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i></font>

1856
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,894
<font color="#bafbfe">No more questions, Dallas.</font>

1857
02:02:51,217 --> 02:02:52,293
<font color="#bafbfe"> Do what I say.</font>

1858
02:02:52,295 --> 02:02:54,489
<font color="#bafbfe">Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.</font>

1859
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:57,243
<font color="#bafbfe">We're not selling any tail in Old Town.</font>

1860
02:02:58,444 --> 02:02:59,644
<font color="#bafbfe">Not tonight.</font>

1861
02:03:04,198 --> 02:03:05,260
<font color="#bafbfe">Don't struggle.</font>

1862
02:03:05,585 --> 02:03:06,993
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll only hurt yourself.</font>

1863
02:03:07,869 --> 02:03:09,404
<font color="#bafbfe">Your cause is lost.</font>

1864
02:03:10,204 --> 02:03:11,573
<font color="#bafbfe">We know everything.</font>

1865
02:03:11,873 --> 02:03:15,569
<font color="#bafbfe">Soon the corpse of Detective
Rafferty will be in our possession,</font>

1866
02:03:16,170 --> 02:03:20,569
<font color="#bafbfe">and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.</font>

1867
02:03:21,257 --> 02:03:23,469
<font color="#bafbfe">There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.</font>

1868
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:27,797
<font color="#bafbfe">My employer will seize what
remains of this neighborhood.</font>

1869
02:03:28,599 --> 02:03:32,676
<font color="#bafbfe">You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.</font>

1870
02:03:32,978 --> 02:03:37,377
<font color="#bafbfe">But it is within your power
to save many lives,</font>

1871
02:03:38,065 --> 02:03:41,779
<font color="#bafbfe">by facilitating the process of transition,</font>

1872
02:03:42,779 --> 02:03:47,479
<font color="#bafbfe">by negotiating the terms of
the surrender of Old Town.</font>

1873
02:03:48,409 --> 02:03:50,578
<font color="#bafbfe">Son of a bitch! I know you.</font>

1874
02:03:51,078 --> 02:03:55,479
<font color="#bafbfe">I have suffered your kind before,
the dregs of Sin City.</font>

1875
02:03:56,292 --> 02:03:58,077
<font color="#bafbfe">I serve a new master now,</font>

1876
02:03:58,377 --> 02:04:02,998
<font color="#bafbfe">and soon you and all your wretched
kind will serve him as well.</font>

1877
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:08,300
<font color="#bafbfe">Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,</font>

1878
02:04:08,805 --> 02:04:11,832
<font color="#bafbfe">because by now, he is surely dead.</font>

1879
02:04:12,434 --> 02:04:13,668
<font color="#bafbfe">You don't know him.</font>

1880
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:16,805
<font color="#bafbfe">My man will find a way.</font>

1881
02:04:18,606 --> 02:04:20,893
<font color="#bafbfe">He always finds a way.</font>

1882
02:04:23,094 --> 02:04:25,238
<font color="#bafbfe">I can't fathom these
Americans always whining</font>

1883
02:04:25,238 --> 02:04:27,125
<font color="#bafbfe">and going on about how they got it so bad.</font>

1884
02:04:28,826 --> 02:04:30,502
<font color="#bafbfe">This is a fine, grand country.</font>

1885
02:04:31,203 --> 02:04:33,137
<font color="#bafbfe">Guiding light of the modern world, it is.</font>

1886
02:04:33,538 --> 02:04:36,024
<font color="#bafbfe">Low taxes, land of opportunity.</font>

1887
02:04:36,625 --> 02:04:39,627
<font color="#bafbfe">Where else would one bullet buy us the
fortune that we're getting for this?</font>

1888
02:04:40,628 --> 02:04:43,131
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches</font>

1889
02:04:43,154 --> 02:04:45,051
<font color="#bafbfe">without shite to show for it.</font>

1890
02:04:50,721 --> 02:04:52,042
<font color="#bafbfe">You find something, Murphy?</font>

1891
02:04:52,368 --> 02:04:54,609
<font color="#bafbfe">Looks to be a poor,
dead cop's badge.</font>

1892
02:04:55,685 --> 02:04:56,811
<font color="#bafbfe">It's all bent up.</font>

1893
02:04:57,813 --> 02:04:59,689
<font color="#bafbfe">What's this stuck in it?</font>

1894
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:04,690
<font color="#bafbfe">Bloody hell. It's the bullet.</font>

1895
02:05:11,993 --> 02:05:13,307
<font color="#bafbfe">You son of a bitch!</font>

1896
02:05:13,533 --> 02:05:14,717
<font color="#bafbfe">Bastard!</font>

1897
02:05:17,082 --> 02:05:18,774
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They weren't cops, these four.</i></font>

1898
02:05:19,376 --> 02:05:20,752
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They were mercenaries.</i></font>

1899
02:05:21,252 --> 02:05:23,470
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If they were hired by who
I think they were,</i></font>

1900
02:05:23,671 --> 02:05:25,957
<font color="#ffff00"><i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i></font>

1901
02:05:26,757 --> 02:05:30,158
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And everything seemed to be going so well.</i></font>

1902
02:05:42,274 --> 02:05:45,774
<font color="#bafbfe">Remember, we don't have to deliver
every last inch of the man, Brian.</font>

1903
02:05:47,613 --> 02:05:49,170
<font color="#bafbfe">You got a good point there, Ronnie.</font>

1904
02:05:49,694 --> 02:05:50,936
<font color="#bafbfe">Lend me your knife.</font>

1905
02:05:53,284 --> 02:05:55,253
<font color="#bafbfe">Should I take a nap while
I'm doing all this waiting?</font>

1906
02:05:56,454 --> 02:05:58,255
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm at the bone, all right?</font>

1907
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:05,631
<font color="#bafbfe">There we go.</font>

1908
02:06:06,631 --> 02:06:10,131
<font color="#bafbfe">Have you ever seen anything
so pretty in your whole life?</font>

1909
02:06:11,845 --> 02:06:14,555
<font color="#bafbfe">We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,</font>

1910
02:06:15,556 --> 02:06:16,957
<font color="#bafbfe">use your imagination, OK?</font>

1911
02:06:28,362 --> 02:06:29,779
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Silence, now.</i></font>

1912
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:32,140
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No air to breathe.</i></font>

1913
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:36,640
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i></font>

1914
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:39,586
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Let it in.</i></font>

1915
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:41,823
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Let it fill your lungs.</i></font>

1916
02:06:43,001 --> 02:06:46,287
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i></font>

1917
02:06:47,588 --> 02:06:50,908
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i></font>

1918
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:54,563
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Miho, you're an angel.</i></font>

1919
02:06:55,764 --> 02:06:56,922
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're a saint.</i></font>

1920
02:06:57,724 --> 02:06:58,917
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're Mother Teresa.</i></font>

1921
02:07:00,018 --> 02:07:01,185
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're Elvis.</i></font>

1922
02:07:02,186 --> 02:07:03,305
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You're God.</i></font>

1923
02:07:05,106 --> 02:07:08,606
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier,
we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i></font>

1924
02:07:10,529 --> 02:07:12,731
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight, they got Gail!</font>

1925
02:07:15,033 --> 02:07:17,885
<font color="#bafbfe">It's a cinch. You got yourselves
a spy in Old Town.</font>

1926
02:07:18,286 --> 02:07:20,204
<font color="#bafbfe">A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.</font>

1927
02:07:21,206 --> 02:07:23,207
<font color="#bafbfe">We gotta find out who it is
and rescue Gail.</font>

1928
02:07:23,708 --> 02:07:25,835
<font color="#bafbfe">First, we gotta get Jackie Boy's head</font>

1929
02:07:25,836 --> 02:07:29,430
<font color="#bafbfe">before it gets to wherever it's going
and this situation blows wide open.</font>

1930
02:07:30,131 --> 02:07:31,131
<font color="#bafbfe">Miho,</font>

1931
02:07:31,856 --> 02:07:34,355
<font color="#bafbfe">I hope to hell you left one
of them alive enough to talk.</font>

1932
02:07:43,436 --> 02:07:45,604
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i></font>

1933
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,560
<font color="#ffff00"><i>We talk.</i></font>

1934
02:08:02,456 --> 02:08:05,033
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Stay smart. Stay cool.</i></font>

1935
02:08:06,333 --> 02:08:08,878
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i></font>

1936
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,590
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i></font>

1937
02:08:13,091 --> 02:08:15,877
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sometimes, it means killing a
whole lot of people.</i></font>

1938
02:08:16,677 --> 02:08:17,738
<font color="#bafbfe">There they are.</font>

1939
02:08:17,761 --> 02:08:19,137
<font color="#bafbfe">What do we do?</font>

1940
02:08:19,139 --> 02:08:21,238
<font color="#bafbfe">We stop them, Dallas.</font>

1941
02:08:29,774 --> 02:08:31,783
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i></font>

1942
02:08:31,784 --> 02:08:34,984
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i></font>

1943
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:42,354
<font color="#bafbfe">Get the head! Get the head!</font>

1944
02:08:44,956 --> 02:08:46,756
<font color="#bafbfe">I got it! I got it!</font>

1945
02:08:53,672 --> 02:08:55,773
<font color="#bafbfe">Suck on this, you stupid slag!</font>

1946
02:09:00,514 --> 02:09:03,306
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i></font>

1947
02:09:03,307 --> 02:09:07,307
<font color="#ffff00"><i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.</i></font>

1948
02:09:10,981 --> 02:09:12,752
<font color="#bafbfe">You want the head now, sweetheart?</font>

1949
02:09:12,978 --> 02:09:14,385
<font color="#bafbfe">So come down and get it!</font>

1950
02:09:20,199 --> 02:09:21,326
<font color="#bafbfe">Brave lad.</font>

1951
02:09:22,327 --> 02:09:25,096
<font color="#bafbfe">I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,</font>

1952
02:09:26,497 --> 02:09:28,876
<font color="#bafbfe">if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.</font>

1953
02:09:30,176 --> 02:09:31,712
<font color="#bafbfe">You got the drop on me, love.</font>

1954
02:09:32,436 --> 02:09:34,301
<font color="#bafbfe">I'm as helpless as a baby.</font>

1955
02:09:42,096 --> 02:09:43,940
<font color="#bafbfe">I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.</font>

1956
02:09:45,141 --> 02:09:48,542
<font color="#bafbfe">It was an outright lie I was giving
ya about me revolver being wet.</font>

1957
02:09:50,229 --> 02:09:51,939
<font color="#bafbfe">You see, I'm not too fond of shooting.</font>

1958
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,810
<font color="#bafbfe">It's my preference to blow things up.</font>

1959
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:57,962
<font color="#bafbfe">Once you blast the roof off a pub</font>

1960
02:09:58,363 --> 02:10:00,707
<font color="#bafbfe">and seen all the parts flying off people,</font>

1961
02:10:02,408 --> 02:10:04,912
<font color="#bafbfe">a little bang bang's never
gonna match the sight of that.</font>

1962
02:10:06,412 --> 02:10:08,716
<font color="#bafbfe">Here's me, with all these fine grenades,</font>

1963
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:11,436
<font color="#bafbfe">and such a sweet beauty of a remote.</font>

1964
02:10:12,042 --> 02:10:14,828
<font color="#bafbfe">But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.</font>

1965
02:10:15,630 --> 02:10:16,899
<font color="#bafbfe">You killed me mates.</font>

1966
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:19,632
<font color="#bafbfe">Someone shoulda told ya.</font>

1967
02:10:19,858 --> 02:10:22,623
<font color="#bafbfe">Never give an Irishman
good cause for revenge.</font>

1968
02:10:24,722 --> 02:10:26,225
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Deadly little Miho.</i></font>

1969
02:10:27,725 --> 02:10:29,560
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You won't feel a thing unless

1976
02:11:05,764 --> 02:11:08,123
<font color="#bafbfe">Do we just gotta stand here and watch this?</font>

1977
02:11:08,725 --> 02:11:09,842
<font color="#bafbfe">What, are you kidding me, man?</font>

1978
02:11:10,644 --> 02:11:13,837
<font color="#bafbfe">I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night and not get tired of it.</font>

1979
02:11:14,439 --> 02:11:15,680
<font color="#bafbfe">I mean, the man's an artist.</font>

1980
02:11:15,981 --> 02:11:20,282
<font color="#bafbfe">Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.</font>

1981
02:11:21,154 --> 02:11:22,997
<font color="#bafbfe">Your skin is perfect.</font>

1982
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:25,807
<font color="#bafbfe">Your nerves, responsive.</font>

1983
02:11:26,408 --> 02:11:27,426
<font color="#bafbfe">Beautiful.</font>

1984
02:11:27,827 --> 02:11:29,697
<font color="#bafbfe">Just give them what they want, Gail.</font>

1985
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,011
<font color="#bafbfe">Becky?
It's over, Gail.</font>

1986
02:11:38,712 --> 02:11:40,060
<font color="#bafbfe">There's no fighting them.</font>

1987
02:11:40,484 --> 02:11:41,532
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight's dead.</font>

1988
02:11:42,509 --> 02:11:44,342
<font color="#bafbfe">They got what's left of that cop we killed.</font>

1989
02:11:44,844 --> 02:11:46,778
<font color="#bafbfe">The mob's gonna turn it
over to the police chief.</font>

1990
02:11:46,779 --> 02:11:48,931
<font color="#bafbfe">The cops are gonna mow us down,
we gotta cut a deal.</font>

1991
02:11:49,932 --> 02:11:51,068
<font color="#bafbfe">You little bitch!</font>

1992
02:11:51,893 --> 02:11:52,926
<font color="#bafbfe">You sold us out!</font>

1993
02:11:53,603 --> 02:11:54,547
<font color="#bafbfe">I didn't have no choice!</font>

1994
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:56,512
<font color="#bafbfe">They was gonna hurt my mom.</font>

1995
02:11:56,689 --> 02:11:58,317
<font color="#bafbfe">You gotta out a deal
with these people.</font>

1996
02:11:58,542 --> 02:12:00,809
<font color="#bafbfe">It's selfish, you holding out like this.</font>

1997
02:12:00,985 --> 02:12:03,462
<font color="#bafbfe">You'll get a lot of girls
killed for no good reason.</font>

1998
02:12:03,863 --> 02:12:05,448
<font color="#bafbfe">It wasn't your mom!</font>

1999
02:12:06,448 --> 02:12:08,560
<font color="#bafbfe">We could have protected her
and you know it.</font>

2000
02:12:09,661 --> 02:12:11,753
<font color="#bafbfe">It was the money,
you stupid little bitch!</font>

2001
02:12:12,454 --> 02:12:13,527
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, there's money.</font>

2002
02:12:13,752 --> 02:12:16,198
<font color="#bafbfe">Sure, you could've moved
my mom into Old Town</font>

2003
02:12:16,376 --> 02:12:18,653
<font color="#bafbfe">and let her know that her
daughter's a goddamn whore.</font>

2004
02:12:19,253 --> 02:12:20,863
<font color="#bafbfe">Breaks your heart, doesn't it?</font>

2005
02:12:21,463 --> 02:12:24,042
<font color="#bafbfe">They offered me what you
couldn't never offer me,</font>

2006
02:12:24,368 --> 02:12:25,627
<font color="#bafbfe">a way out.</font>

2007
02:12:26,302 --> 02:12:27,862
<font color="#bafbfe">I had to watch out for my own neck.</font>

2008
02:12:28,262 --> 02:12:29,314
<font color="#bafbfe">Your neck.</font>

2009
02:12:30,015 --> 02:12:33,525
<font color="#bafbfe">Your precious, scrawny, little neck!</font>

2010
02:12:38,355 --> 02:12:39,355
<font color="#bafbfe">You're crazy!</font>

2011
02:12:39,381 --> 02:12:42,380
<font color="#bafbfe">You could have ripped my
throat out, you crazy whore!</font>

2012
02:12:44,029 --> 02:12:46,773
<font color="#bafbfe">Schutz, fetch my blades.</font>

2013
02:12:47,573 --> 02:12:49,900
<font color="#bafbfe">Stuka, kill this one.</font>

2014
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:51,402
<font color="#bafbfe">No, I was promised!</font>

2015
02:12:51,578 --> 02:12:53,106
<font color="#bafbfe">Stupid little bitch!</font>

2016
02:12:53,108 --> 02:12:54,462
<font color="#bafbfe">You deserve worse!</font>

2017
02:12:54,538 --> 02:12:57,139
<font color="#bafbfe">I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.</font>

2018
02:13:00,002 --> 02:13:01,046
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey.</font>

2019
02:13:02,546 --> 02:13:03,614
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey.</font>

2020
02:13:05,216 --> 02:13:06,500
<font color="#bafbfe">Nobody. I don't see nobody.</font>

2021
02:13:06,801 --> 02:13:07,818
<font color="#bafbfe">Will you look at that?</font>

2022
02:13:08,243 --> 02:13:09,328
<font color="#bafbfe">It's right through me.</font>

2023
02:13:09,453 --> 02:13:10,461
<font color="#bafbfe">Guys, look.</font>

2024
02:13:10,637 --> 02:13:12,099
<font color="#bafbfe">There's something wrapped around it.</font>

2025
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,055
<font color="#bafbfe">Some kind of note.</font>

2026
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,752
<font color="#bafbfe">Give it to me.</font>

2027
02:13:17,729 --> 02:13:19,064
<font color="#bafbfe">It's poked right through me.</font>

2028
02:13:19,789 --> 02:13:20,789
<font color="#bafbfe">Guys, look.</font>

2029
02:13:22,067 --> 02:13:23,396
<font color="#bafbfe">It's starting to hurt.</font>

2030
02:13:23,421 --> 02:13:25,719
<font color="#bafbfe">Out back. Everyone.
Bring the women.</font>

2031
02:13:26,695 --> 02:13:29,448
<font color="#bafbfe">Do you think somebody should
call me a doctor or something?</font>

2032
02:13:29,948 --> 02:13:32,795
<font color="#bafbfe">McCarthy, you fool.</font>

2033
02:13:34,496 --> 02:13:35,412
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey.</font>

2034
02:13:36,413 --> 02:13:37,417
<font color="#bafbfe">Guys?</font>

2035
02:13:44,506 --> 02:13:45,789
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Dozens of them,</i></font>

2036
02:13:46,215 --> 02:13:47,625

<font color="#ffff00"><i>But the alley is crooked,</i></font>

2039
02:13:55,163 --> 02:13:57,279
<font color="#ffff00"><i>dark and very narrow.</i></font>

2040
02:13:58,728 --> 02:14:00,037
<font color="#ffff00"><i>They can't surround me.</i></font>

2041
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:04,939
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds with the
careful choice of where to fight.</i></font>

2042
02:14:10,657 --> 02:14:12,841
<font color="#bafbfe">You can have Old Town, I don't care.</font>

2043
02:14:13,542 --> 02:14:15,162
<font color="#bafbfe">Just give me the woman.</font>

2044
02:14:18,163 --> 02:14:19,248
<font color="#bafbfe">Shut up.</font>

2045
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:22,827
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight, don't do this.</font>

2046
02:14:23,127 --> 02:14:24,873
<font color="#bafbfe">Hey wait a minute.
Something's not right.</font>

2047
02:14:25,298 --> 02:14:27,322
<font color="#bafbfe">Shut up, or I'll plug you!</font>

2048
02:14:27,798 --> 02:14:29,212
<font color="#bafbfe">Of course, Mr. McCarthy.</font>

2049
02:14:29,537 --> 02:14:32,523
<font color="#bafbfe">A fair trade. She's all yours.</font>

2050
02:14:41,854 --> 02:14:46,074
<font color="#bafbfe">Now, if you'll explain to me why we
shouldn't blow both of you to pieces.</font>

2051
02:14:46,775 --> 02:14:49,563
<font color="#bafbfe">Dwight, what have you done?</font>

2052
02:14:50,863 --> 02:14:52,541
<font color="#bafbfe">Exactly what I had to.</font>

2053
02:14:54,242 --> 02:14:56,141
<font color="#bafbfe">Every step of the way.</font>

2054
02:14:59,329 --> 02:15:02,198
<font color="#bafbfe">No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!</font>

2055
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:04,100
<font color="#bafbfe">How come there's tape over his mouth?</font>

2056
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:19,057
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i></font>

2057
02:15:19,559 --> 02:15:23,145
<font color="#bafbfe">Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.</font>

2058
02:15:24,146 --> 02:15:27,917
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But there's nothing like having your
friends show up with lots of guns.</i></font>

2059
02:15:28,318 --> 02:15:31,217
<font color="#bafbfe">No! McCarthy, you shit!</font>

2066

2067
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:52,757

2068
