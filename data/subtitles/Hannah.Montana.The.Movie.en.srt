1
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,944
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

2
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,176
What is with all the pushing behind me?

3
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,410
Here you go, girls.

4
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,382
It's Miley Stewart.
We've got to get in there.

5
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,149
Our names are on the list.

6
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,627
Well, why didn't you say so?
In your dreams, sweet cheeks. Next!

7
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:34,221
- No, no. They're on there. I promise.
- We need two.

8
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,062
You are the only pop star I know
who can't get into her own concert.

9
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:42,697
She was just here.
I don't know where she went.

10
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,708
- Stop!
- Go!

11
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,478
Somebody, stop those girls!

12
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,382
- Go faster!
- I can't! This is a golf cart!

13
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,386
Stop!

14
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,389
Those girls shouldn't be here!
They don't have a backstage pass!

15
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:03,825
- What are you doing?
- Stop in the name of Security!

16
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,328
- Watch out!
- I need backup!

17
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:08,889
Call for backup! Whoa!

18
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,924
- Yes!
- Yes! Oh!

19
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:24,509
Stop!

20
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,349
- Please stop!
- It's OK. It's OK. They're with me.

21
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:30,753
Come on. Go, go, go.

22
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:53,371
Hey.

23
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:57,977
Dad.

24
00:02:58,684 --> 00:02:59,708
What?

25
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:34,379
Showtime, baby doll.

26
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,818
- She's on the move.
- All right, let's go.

27
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,192
Good luck! Don't mess up!

28
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,031
This way. Follow me.

29
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,005
- Come on.
- She's coming right now.

30
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,373
All right, talent's on its way.

31
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,901
- Oh!
- You do that every night.

32
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:01,540
- Love you, Daddy.
- I'm loving you right back, darling.

33
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,212
Don't forget it's your turn
to do the dishes tonight.

34
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:05,414
I did them last night.

35
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,913
Don't give me no lip. You're the one
that wanted the best of both worlds.

36
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:14,459
- Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!
- Watch your head.

37
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,999
Here we go, everybody! Whoo!

38
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,776
Oh, yeah.

39
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,334
Come on.

40
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,720
Cut! We'll fix that last bit in post.

41
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,783
That's a wrap, people.

42
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,727
- Hannah, as always, fabulous.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,314
No. It's OK. I'm sorry.
I just had to meet you.

44
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,840
I promised my girls
I'd say hi to you for them.

45
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,375
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,548
They even wrote out some
questions, if you have a second.

47
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,856
Oh, my gosh, this is
such a thrill. Do you mind?

48
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:52,556
- Not at all.
- Don't even think about it.

49
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:55,157
- No, Vita. It's OK.
- Nothing about this man is OK.

50
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,259
Hello, Oswald.

51
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,600
Hello, Vita. Looking lovely as ever.

52
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:03,130
Icky teeth, really?
Isn't that beneath even you?

53
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,339
<i>Oswald Granger, chief sleaze
of Bon Chic magazine,</i>

54
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,279
Britain's most notorious tabloid.

55
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,875
And we would love, with a capital "ove,"

56
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,479
to do a cover feature on the global
phenomenon that is Hannah Montana.

57
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:18,251
And by "feature" he means
"career-ending expose. "

58
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,783
"Country girl living her dreams beloved
by millions," that's all we got.

59
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,819
That's all you're gonna get.
Now get out.

60
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,426
Can't blame a bloke for trying.

61
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:31,336
How could you even think
we have something to hide?

62
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:34,034
- He didn't see anything, did he?
- I don't think so.

63
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,541
Good. Hannah, honey,

64
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,975
you can't talk to anyone
unless I'm at your side.

65
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:41,038
I'm your publicist. You need to
concentrate on what you do best

66
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:43,413
which is singing
your scrappy little heart out.

67
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,315
Let me worry about everything else,

68
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:49,413
like making sure your
little secret stays a secret.

69
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,856
Sometimes I wish I could
be Hannah all the time.

70
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,757
You and me both, kid.

71
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:57,231
Out of the way, you jackals.
Step aside. Coming through.

72
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,859
That's right, don't touch the pop star.
Move aside.

73
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:13,941
<i>...like making sure
your little secret stays a secret.</i>

74
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:17,214
Secret? What secret?
Move your bum, you old cow.

75
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:24,615
Talk to me, Ozzie,
and don't disappoint.

76
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,825
- Apparently there's a secret.
- Good. Because the cover's ready.

77
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:31,060
I just need the story to go with it.

78
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:35,697
Find out that secret. She's the most
popular teenager in the world.

79
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,902
<i>So I suggest you go out
and find me every juicy,</i>

80
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:43,641
sordid detail of Hannah Montana's
outrageous, glamorous life.

81
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:51,011
All right. Line it up, people.
We're going to choose new teams.

82
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:54,854
Dead girl in the middle
of the floor. Anybody?

83
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,359
Fabulous news:
Beyonce has double pneumonia.

84
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:02,025
Has to drop out of the
New York Music Awards. You're in!

85
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,624
That is great. Not for Beyonce.

86
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,932
I really should call.
But, yes! I'm so excited!

87
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,029
What am I gonna sing?
What am I gonna wear?

88
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:10,803
Great minds. The car and the box
are already outside,

89
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,902
so Hannah has to do a major shop now.

90
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,345
Last chance. Come on.

91
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:18,509
Miley? Hello?
What about my birthday party?

92
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,451
Minor Hannah emergency.
I'll be there, I promise.

93
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,017
Wasn't that fun?

94
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,927
Yeah, but it feels weird having
them give me stuff for free.

95
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:34,229
Please. Do you know what a well-placed
photo of you shopping is worth?

96
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,064
You're a star, an icon.

97
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:39,435
You look at it, touch it, wear it,
and the whole world has to have it.

98
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:42,600
They owe it to you, Hannah.
Name it and it's yours.

99
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:45,202
- Really?
- I have so much to teach you.

100
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:50,147
If she doesn't hurry,
you're going to miss your plane.

101
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:56,089
Yeah, that's right, losers! I'm going
to college! Tennessee Universi...

102
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,785
- University.
- Where is that girl?

103
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:05,092
- I can't decide.
- Decide? No deciding. Too stressful.

104
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:07,760
Take them all. We'll just
add them to the pile. Girls.

105
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,600
Ooh.

106
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:12,163
Watches. I totally need a new watch.

107
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,198
Is that the time? I can't believe it.

108
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:18,008
We got to go.
Eleven messages. Jackson.

109
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:21,038
Lilly's present. Lilly...
would totally love those shoes.

110
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,416
- She will so love these.
- I'm sorry. I saw these first.

111
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,651
Can you wrap these for me?

112
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,852
They're for my best friend.
She's 16 today.

113
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,827
Funny, they're for my best friend, too.

114
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,124
My best friend is a six and a half.

115
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:36,495
Funny, my best friend's
a six and a half, too.

116
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:40,059
Tyra Banks, that's our only pair.

117
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:43,765
- Not funny. Do you know who I am?
- I know you know who I am.

118
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:44,830
- So?
- So?

119
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:45,966
- So?
- So?

120
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:50,138
- Give me that shoe.
- Get away from me!

121
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:54,844
You know what? If you want it, jump
for it. Jump for the shoe, Hannah.

122
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,352
Fine. Gimme!

123
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,418
Got it!

124
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,289
Yes! Yes!

125
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,694
Give me my shoe, lady!

126
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,345
She is so in trouble.

127
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,711
No, you didn't! Hannah Montana!

128
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,289
- Yes!
- I appreciate you helping me up,

129
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,853
but I don't appreciate
you not helping me with this.

130
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,339
Relax? Are you kidding me?
Have you met my dad?

131
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,741
He is not gonna shake off me missing
saying goodbye to Jackson.

132
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,405
Give us a smile. You look amazing.

133
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,777
Thank you. We got to go.

134
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,849
Hey!

135
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,721
And I didn't even get the shoes.
I am the worst friend in the world.

136
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,427
It's him.

137
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,959
Oswald. Step on it!

138
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,164
I cannot get out of the car
looking like Miley,

139
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,502
and I cannot show up at Lilly's
party looking like Hannah.

140
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,083
Where are you headed?

141
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,566
Hi! Thank you. Thank you.

142
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:52,540
Hey, Lilly. What's up?

143
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,806
We've talked about this party
since we were, like, 12. Where...

144
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,746
- Hi! How are you? Where are you?
- I'm almost there.

145
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:00,874
She hung up on...

146
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,943
Where are you? Everybody's waiting...

147
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,852
- Sorry, wrong number!
- Miley!

148
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,881
Two smoothies, please.
Where's Miley? We haven't seen her.

149
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,190
Just spoke with her.
She'll be here any second.

150
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,261
Rico, what's this hole
at the top of the cake?

151
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,671
It's a high-pressure
electro-pneumatic solenoid on it.

152
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:27,167
It's 150 pounds per square inch
with a brass safety-check valve.

153
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:31,444
Then I just hit this button
and bam! Sparklers go off,

154
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:35,078
and a "happy birthday, Lilly" banner
shoots out the top of the cake.

155
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,953
Once again...
Rico is a genius.

156
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:54,095
Hold it! This is a private event.
Guests only! What did I tell you? Stop!

157
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,573
- Smile.
- No pictures.

158
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,571
That's what I call a Lilly...
Wow.

159
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,413
It's Hannah Montana!

160
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:08,546
Is that Hannah Montana?

161
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,234
Guys, I'm only here... Wait!

162
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,307
Happy birthday to... I want to say happy
birthday to my number one fan, Lilly.

163
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:33,438
She's over that way.
She's over that way.

164
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:39,551
Happy birthday, Lilly. Happy birthday.

165
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,113
I'm sorry. I had no choice.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

166
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:47,059
You will never, ever, ever
make it up to me.

167
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,156
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,229
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

169
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:08,045
<i>Crazy, Crazy,
Crazy, Crazy, Crazy.</i>

170
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,712
<i>Uh, you guys know the words
to Let's Get Crazy?</i>

171
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:21,095
All right, then, here we go!

172
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:29,763
You ready? Here we go.

173
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,141
<i># Life is just a party
so come as you are</i>

174
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:39,206
<i># Dress it up or dress it down
Don't forget your guitar, yeah</i>

175
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,811
<i># Just be courageous
'Cause style's contagious</i>

176
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:46,016
<i># Everyone can rock out like a superstar</i>

177
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:49,925
<i># Let's get crazy
Get up and dance</i>

178
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:53,727
<i># Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth taking a chance</i>

179
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,756
<i># Let's get crazy</i>

180
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,701
<i># Yeah, just kick up your heels</i>

181
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:59,704
<i># Don't miss out
Time to shout</i>

182
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:03,971
<i># Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy</i>

183
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,103
<i># Crazy</i>

184
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,078
Lilly! Lilly, we got cake!

185
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,283
Hold up. Wait. Birthday Girl,
I have some questions.

186
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:20,987
Is it true Hannah's really 43 years old?
She lip syncs? Grew up in Nashville?

187
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,963
More like a cornfield in
some place called Crowley Corners.

188
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,022
Really? How do you spell "Crowley"?

189
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,092
It's Lilly Truscott, everybody!
Happy birthday.

190
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,626
We got cake over there.

191
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,238
Just like it sounds.

192
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:36,634
- Lilly!
- Oliver? Quick!

193
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:39,737
Light the cake. We're gonna
stop Lilly from leaving.

194
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,715
Cake? No, I'm not ready yet!

195
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,114
Come on! We have cake!

196
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,923
Eww!

197
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,064
Sorry.

198
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,204
Lilly, please pick up.

199
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:13,438
- Did you see this?
- Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

200
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,042
Isn't it... horrible. Bad Hannah.

201
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,213
She and I need to have
a little conversation.

202
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:21,588
Now? But she's getting ready
to go to New York.

203
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,253
Didn't she tell you?
There's an amazing opportunity.

204
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,752
Yeah, I know about New York. I got
CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

205
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,994
She and I are flying to Tennessee
for her Grandma Ruby's birthday.

206
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,093
Didn't she tell you?

207
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:37,266
A shoe fight! You got
into a stinking shoe fight?

208
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,639
In my defense,
I totally saw those shoes first.

209
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:44,875
This is absolutely, T-totally,
without a doubt unacceptable.

210
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,783
Which pretty much describes
all of your behavior lately.

211
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,185
Standing up your brother?
Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

212
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:54,282
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry,
but I can't talk about this now.

213
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,293
I got to go to New York.
It's the music awards.

214
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,591
Your grandmother's birthday
doesn't matter?

215
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:00,654
This is totally different
and you know it.

216
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:02,963
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

217
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:06,596
Father Montana, Hannah not going
to New York is really not an option.

218
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:10,233
- Her name is Miley.
- Miley'll be back before she leaves.

219
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:13,108
She's a superstar. I can get her
a private jet if she wants.

220
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:15,739
Yes! I've always wanted
one of those.

221
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,181
For gosh sakes.

222
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,647
Fine. You win.

223
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,090
But you heard our superstar.
She needs a jet.

224
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,956
- Really?
- I like your thinking.

225
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,621
It will take some time to arrange,

226
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:32,392
but I'll go ahead to New York
and set up the meet and greet.

227
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:46,939
Ooh. Next time, you might want to
demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

228
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:49,074
Why in the heck you
getting all Hannahed up?

229
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,277
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op.

230
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:54,845
The balloons, the limos,
the screaming fans.

231
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:58,324
Like Vita says,
"It's all about the publicity. "

232
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,262
Yeah. That Vita's
just full of good advice.

233
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,928
Absolutely full of it.

234
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,334
Hello, New York!

235
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:20,747
Looks like your limo's here.

236
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,122
Ain't she a beaut?

237
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:31,752
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

238
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,099
Dad, come on.

239
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,831
Yeah, maybe I should've
remembered Grandma's birthday.

240
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,601
- I did.
- Jackson, not now.

241
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,202
Dad! Please, Hannah Montana
needs to be walking down the red carpet

242
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,179
in New York in less than three hours.

243
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:53,376
Miley, all you ever
wanted to do was sing.

244
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,113
Hannah let you do that
and still have a normal life.

245
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,916
That was the dream, remember?

246
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:02,486
That's why we
created her in the first place.

247
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,757
I don't know what she's about anymore.

248
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:07,890
- What are you saying?
- I think we might be done.

249
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:14,366
- You can't take Hannah away from me.
- Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

250
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:17,534
No! Stop the truck. I'm not
doing this. I want to go home.

251
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,304
Stop the truck!

252
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:41,123
You are home. Look around you.

253
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,758
Hannah means everything to me.

254
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,861
That right there might be the problem.

255
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:51,268
You're saying I can
never be Hannah again?

256
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,939
Ask me again in two weeks.

257
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,346
Right now let's see
if a country girl still exists.

258
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:59,682
- Two weeks?
- Think of it as a Hannah detox.

259
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,813
Take that wig off
and get back in the truck.

260
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:06,657
No. I'm not getting
back in the truck. No way.

261
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,162
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

262
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:20,902
I'm going to New York whether you
like it or not, and I'm not... Whoa!

263
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,940
Give that back, you mangy little...

264
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:27,847
Look at that. Girl don't even
recognize her own horse.

265
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,680
Now that truly is sad.

266
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,082
Blue Jeans?

267
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:40,825
Meet us at the house.
Just about a mile up the road.

268
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,302
Don't forget your suitcase.

269
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,945
In my defense, you do look different.

270
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,580
Did you do something to your tail?

271
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,714
Good boy.
All right, now. Help me out.

272
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,553
Hold still.

273
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,855
Blue Jeans!

274
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,155
Blue Jeans!

275
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,106
Ya!

276
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,549
Hi. You all right?

277
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,826
Blue Jeans doesn't really
take well to strangers.

278
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:49,160
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

279
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:53,193
I know. He's my horse.

280
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:57,634
Miley?

281
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:01,241
It's me. Travis?

282
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:05,270
Travis Brody? We were
in the first grade together.

283
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:07,579
Me and you went to your
Uncle Earl's farm and swam

284
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:10,677
- and got poison oak all over our...
- I remember you, OK?

285
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:14,249
I also remember you hanging me
headfirst down a well.

286
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,419
Yeah. I guess I had a
pretty big crush on you back then.

287
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,520
But don't worry about it.

288
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,233
I'm over it.

289
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:26,530
Good to know.

290
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,535
Don't come around
too often anymore, do you?

291
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,338
Often enough.

292
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:36,312
Only a couple times since your
ma died that I've heard about.

293
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,872
So how long are you staying?

294
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,213
- Two weeks.
- Ha!

295
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,243
- Good luck with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

296
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,882
Considering what you're wearing

297
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:48,518
and the fact that you couldn't
get back on your horse,

298
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,528
I'm guessing you
went California on us.

299
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:54,623
I have not. You don't know
anything about me or California.

300
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,528
Let me guess, celebrities are
just regular folk like you and me.

301
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,301
- Some are.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

302
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,467
You, uh... you
actually know any?

303
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,641
I know Hannah Montana.

304
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:08,611
Hannah Montana? Really?

305
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:11,784
Yeah. I...

306
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:14,446
I practically saved her life
surfing the other day.

307
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:18,982
She owes me big time. We're like...
We're like best friends.

308
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:23,494
Huh. Best friends.

309
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,027
They're all waiting for you inside.
I'll take Blue Jeans, put him away.

310
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,597
- You don't have to do that.
- It's kind of my job.

311
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:37,276
I've been working for
your grandma for the summer.

312
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,800
Ooh.

313
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:44,475
This is usually about the time
someone would say "thank you. "

314
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,454
- I was getting there.
- No need.

315
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:51,920
See you round, Smiley Miley.

316
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:55,361
Remember? That's what he used
to call you. Smiley Miley.

317
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:58,656
I remember.

318
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,705
I got my Miley back!

319
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:45,646
Come on, Miley,
take the next verse.

320
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:48,675
Come on.

321
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:55,023
Get your dog back and your house back...

322
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:02,362
I want my life back, Dad.

323
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:09,140
Sorry. Sorry, everybody. Hey.

324
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:10,574
Happy birthday, Grandma.

325
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,513
Well, I just blew out my candles,
and I already got my birthday wish.

326
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:18,312
Come here, sweet thing. Ohhh.

327
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:21,878
I have missed you
more than you can imagine.

328
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:24,048
And thank you.

329
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,754
Thank you so much for this.
I just love it.

330
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:30,921
There's only one King,

331
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:35,696
and I have been saving him
a place of honor.

332
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,697
How long have you been planning this?

333
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,403
Must have taken you forever to find it.

334
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,911
Apparently, I've thought
of nothing else for weeks.

335
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,413
Hurt your grandma's feelings

336
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:49,938
and a chewed-up wig'll be
the least of your worries.

337
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:53,180
Hey, Uncle Chuck.
Listen, it's time for cake.

338
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,917
I'll collect the supper plates,
you pass out the forks.

339
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:57,925
Give you a chance
to say hi to a few folks.

340
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,129
- You remember Cousin Derrick.
- What's with the rat?

341
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:07,157
Ferret. Harlow.

342
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,635
- Good to be home.
- Yeah.

343
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:14,501
Got any plates for me?

344
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:17,603
Do me a favor. Introduce
yourself to Lorelai over there.

345
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:21,104
She's new and a little shy.

346
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,584
You ain't up to your
matchmaking again, are you?

347
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,952
- Me? Never.
- That's right.

348
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,083
Then I reckon it would be a shame
for anybody to feel left out.

349
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,027
- Uh-huh.
- Excuse me. Got anything for me?

350
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,629
I don't know.
Are you sure you can handle it?

351
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,430
You'd be amazed at what I can handle.

352
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,535
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Robby Ray.

353
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:44,130
- Oh!
- Ha!

354
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:45,471
Told you you'd be amazed.

355
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,907
Yahh!

356
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,380
I got it. It's not that bad,
ladies and gentlemen.

357
00:28:58,623 --> 00:29:00,716
Oh, Lord!

358
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:13,030
- Howdy!
- Oh, no.

359
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,666
Oh!

360
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:23,280
Whee doggies!
Great news, everybody.

361
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,706
Elvis is alive and well.

362
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,637
I keep thinking
I should change the wallpaper,

363
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:24,509
but your mom picked this out
when she was about your age.

364
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,508
I like it.

365
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,041
You used to like a lot of things
about coming to see me.

366
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:35,250
- Grandma...
- It's OK.

367
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,952
I know it's not personal.

368
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:44,123
- I just miss my Miley.
- Why does everyone keep saying that?

369
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,760
Maybe you should be
asking yourself that question.

370
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:51,799
Caterpillar in a tree
How you wonder who you'll be

371
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,078
Can't go far
But you can always dream

372
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:01,642
Your daddy used to
say that to you every night.

373
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:05,082
Not so much anymore.

374
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:24,903
Miley! Rise and shine!

375
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,851
Commence Operation
Save Hannah Montana.

376
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:41,516
Morning! Sleep well?
I've been up for hours.

377
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,024
How about I go feed the chickens
and grab some eggs?

378
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,519
Like I always say, ain't nothin' better
than farm-fresh eggs for breakfast!

379
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,261
Who in the Sam Heck was that?

380
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,839
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

381
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,079
Get away from...

382
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,813
Ahh!

383
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,187
How long you think before she
figures out to put down the bucket?

384
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,956
Oh, I'm gonna...

385
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:11,106
All right. Here we go,
one farm-fresh egg.

386
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,642
- Y'all couldn't wait?
- Darling, we waited,

387
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:16,087
but eventually we had to get on
with the rest of our lives.

388
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:19,751
Get yourself cleaned up, honeybee.
I'm taking you to the farmers' market.

389
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:21,821
Yay.

390
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,699
Oh, Robby Ray, my gutters need fixing.

391
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,760
And my truck is making a noise
you just don't want to hear.

392
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:32,169
I'm on it.

393
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,436
If you need any help,
talk to the foreman.

394
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:36,466
Might be down by the vegetable patch.

395
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,943
Gotcha.

396
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:41,005
But don't go squashing my squashes.
They're prizewinners.

397
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:46,083
Looks like you beat me to it.

398
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:51,318
Lorelai?

399
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,228
Uh, Ruby didn't... You're the foreman?

400
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:59,529
- That would be me.
- So that means you're living here, too?

401
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,763
You're good at this.

402
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:04,037
That's me, right over there.

403
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,904
I was looking for a fresh start,
and I guess Ruby thought

404
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:11,573
that both me and the farm could
use some looking after, so...

405
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:14,412
She does like putting things together,
that's for sure.

406
00:35:19,322 --> 00:35:21,813
Lorelai. The foreman.

407
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,190
I'll be dang.

408
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,493
All right, you guys.

409
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:30,999
I'd like to introduce
you all to Tammy Wynette.

410
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:34,766
She is the fastest two-legged
animal in the world.

411
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:38,468
She can't fly, she can't swim,
but she sure can...

412
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:41,472
...bite. Be careful.

413
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,811
We talked about this.
Unless you want to see ostrich burgers

414
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,341
on the menu at the snack bar...

415
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,184
I'll take it from here.
Go feed Miss Pearl.

416
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:52,553
No, I hate Miss Pearl.

417
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,357
All right, kids.
Who wants to see a real live...

418
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:01,860
...alligator?

419
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:02,959
Let go!

420
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:18,841
Help!

421
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,150
Ah!

422
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:32,958
What's with the giant udder?

423
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,433
That is something you
don't see in Beverly Hills.

424
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:38,063
Old Man Crowley died
and left the town the meadows,

425
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:39,970
pretty much everything you can see.

426
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:42,270
But we don't exactly
have enough for the taxes,

427
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,971
so I've been helping organize
a fundraiser or two.

428
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:48,311
It's just awful.
Developers circling like vultures.

429
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,348
Talking about putting up
apartment buildings. Shopping malls.

430
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,354
A mall? Really?

431
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,790
If they have their way,
there won't be any open land left.

432
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:03,457
Hey, Ruby. How'd you like one of those,
young lady?

433
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:05,797
- Thank you.
- Come on, Miley.

434
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,359
- Would there be a Bloomie's?
- We've got work to do.

435
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:09,893
Sorry.

436
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:13,299
- You're looking at the future.
- Thank you.

437
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:14,468
Uh-huh.

438
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:17,436
Oh.

439
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:20,175
I swear, everything
about that man irks me.

440
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:22,183
- Morning, Miss Ruby.
- Morning.

441
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,048
See you got your
granddaughter with you.

442
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,781
- Yeah, sure do.
- Ain't she grown some.

443
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:29,313
Amazing what a little
food and water will do.

444
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,420
Nice chatting.

445
00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:36,398
When we finish, maybe you
and I can do a little shopping.

446
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:38,457
In there? No, thanks. I'm good.

447
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:42,460
Look, missy. You may be
Hannah Montana back home,

448
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:45,737
but here we're
britches and boots. And...

449
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:49,473
...if that ain't good enough for you,
maybe you should just pack up and git.

450
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:55,744
You might be fooling your daddy,
but you sure as heck ain't fooling me.

451
00:37:57,688 --> 00:37:59,417
Now, I'm sorry for fussing at you,

452
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:03,154
but... I just think you should
consider yourself lucky that,

453
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:06,460
for the time being, you have
a place like this to call home.

454
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:08,592
I do.

455
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:11,133
And I'm sorry.

456
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,663
I know you are.

457
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,072
Come on!

458
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,380
- Right here?
- Yeah.

459
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:28,011
Now... slice up
this watermelon for samples.

460
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,215
You're looking at the future
of Crowley Meadows.

461
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,952
I'm going to take this mood
of mine and put it to good use.

462
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:37,353
Free samples! Here you go, girls.

463
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:40,456
Ruby, you can have as many
fundraisers as you want,

464
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:42,057
but you are not going to stop progress.

465
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:45,230
Turning Mills Pond into a landfill
is not what I call progress.

466
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,931
Well, obviously...

467
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,108
I'll be right back.

468
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:58,743
- Morning.
- Morning.

469
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:01,846
Um, do you know this girl?

470
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,983
Sure, Hannah Montana.
I don't live under a rock.

471
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,051
No, obviously not. No, no.

472
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,757
- You wanna try something?
- A bit of that.

473
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:11,287
OK.

474
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,265
That's very nice. That's delicious.

475
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,464
- Uh, I'll be right back.
- Maybe she used a different name.

476
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:23,500
- I don't think so.
- Somebody must know where she lives.

477
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:26,274
- No. I got to go.
- OK. Thank you!

478
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:20,000
- Miley, help me get this...
- Get up.

479
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,003
Help him up now.
Let's get him out of here.

480
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:31,949
Help me with this poor man.
Are you OK?

481
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:35,680
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
- Honey, you are so forgiven.

482
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,154
You're too kind. No, really.

483
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:42,957
You're about the same age.
You know this Hannah Montana?

484
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:46,658
Hannah Montana! Who don't know
Hannah Montana? She's famous.

485
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:48,724
She's telling everyone she's
from this little patch of nowhere,

486
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:50,099
but no one's ever seen her.

487
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:52,400
I seen her, saw her,
know her, knew her.

488
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,236
- You're the first one.
- I know all the Montanas-es.

489
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:57,539
Do you know where I could find them?

490
00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:01,241
Sure. You go about five miles south
of town, turn right at the first crick.

491
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:03,044
- Left at the second crook.
- There you are.

492
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,448
- There you are.
- Oh.

493
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:07,784
- So thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah. Sure.

494
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:09,413
- Take care.
- Yeah. Thank you.

495
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,193
Hello?

496
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,100
Hello, anybody home?

497
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:55,337
- What?
- A better question would be "where?"

498
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:59,274
As in "where's my story?"

499
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,402
Sorry, love. Two seconds.

500
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:05,779
- Hello?
- Daddy, where are you? You didn't call.

501
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:10,253
Sorry, darlings. Daddy's working.
I'll call you back in two seconds.

502
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:13,586
Hurry. It's nearly lights out.

503
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:17,719
Sorry, Lucinda. Don't worry. I guarantee
this Hannah Montana story is...

504
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:19,228
Hannah Montana!

505
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:22,163
I can't believe it! Dad!
I'm glad we called you.

506
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,531
I don't believe this!
Have you met her yet?

507
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:28,869
<i>Not now, girls!</i>

508
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:32,000
- Please get us her autograph!
- I'm going to faint!

509
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:34,307
Who's that?
What's all that screaming?

510
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:38,281
- Darlings, I'll call you back.
- Daddy, Daddy, make sure you do!

511
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:42,976
- Sorry. You were saying?
- Ozzie, I want the dirt!

512
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,086
Trust me, I'm all over it.

513
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:47,318
Oh.

514
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:02,232
Oh, I messed up. Um...

515
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:10,476
Oh...

516
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:28,890
Um, I'm sorry. Don't stop. I'm going.

517
00:43:28,936 --> 00:43:31,234
Don't worry about it. I was goofing off.

518
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:33,706
I think it's great you're
still doing that singing thing.

519
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,606
Singing thing?
What singing thing?

520
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:38,407
Come on. Everyone knows
that's all you ever wanted to do.

521
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:41,779
And... you actually got a nice voice.

522
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:45,709
Thanks. I've heard that.

523
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,017
What did you think of the song?
I wrote it.

524
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:56,495
- Song?
- Yeah, that thing I was just singing?

525
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:57,931
Did I mention I wrote it?

526
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:01,800
And it seems like you got most
of the notes right. So way to go, Miley.

527
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:06,832
"Most"?

528
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:15,041
- So why didn't you like it?
- Jeez, I didn't say I didn't like it.

529
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:17,109
You sure didn't say you did.

530
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:20,145
- It's not bad. It just wasn't...
- Good.

531
00:44:20,189 --> 00:44:21,952
About anything.

532
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:24,859
Doesn't tell me anything about
who you are or what you feel.

533
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,523
- You know what I'm feeling now?
- I've got an idea.

534
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,759
And sorry, but you asked.

535
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,234
Why are you bothering with this anyway?

536
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,331
Starting up an egg business.
Me and Ruby struck a deal.

537
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,468
I rebuild the coop,
I get to sell the eggs.

538
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,738
It's a lot of rebuilding.

539
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,339
Hey, you got to
start somewhere, right?

540
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:50,315
Life's a climb, but the view is great.

541
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,357
That's all you want to do,
is sell eggs in Crowley Corners?

542
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:57,862
- Where else am I going to?
- That's not what I meant.

543
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,524
I know what you meant.
You don't get this place, do you?

544
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:02,056
Ow. Ow.

545
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:05,002
- Come on. Saddle up.
- Where are we going?

546
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:08,097
To show you... what you're missing.

547
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:11,167
Ow.

548
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:41,898
- You're next!
- No way! No!

549
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:45,643
Whoa, whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

550
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:51,807
Yes! We got it!

551
00:46:11,106 --> 00:46:13,904
Ha!

552
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:57,646
It's cold!

553
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,529
We should get going. We don't
want to be late for the fundraiser.

554
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:58,941
Whoo-hoo! Good job, Daddy!

555
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:03,252
Robby Ray Stewart, everybody.
Good to have you back, sir.

556
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:10,194
- You were so great up there.
- Thank you, honey.

557
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:17,229
What is the matter with him?
He's dated before.

558
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:19,501
Maybe it's starting to mean
something again.

559
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,807
We're going to slow it down
for this next song, if that's all right.

560
00:48:31,353 --> 00:48:33,651
- What?
- She likes you. You like her.

561
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:36,158
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

562
00:48:36,192 --> 00:48:38,217
Miley, you just wouldn't unders...

563
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:42,962
- How do you know she likes me?
- Because she'd be crazy if she didn't.

564
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,762
You got a good point there.

565
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:48,794
I saw Lorelai go out back. Maybe
you can go help her with the empties.

566
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,032
I could try.

567
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:12,056
Miley? Would you like to dance?

568
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,800
Sorry about that back there.

569
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,706
This trip was always supposed to be
about Miley. Not really about me.

570
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:27,134
Ever think the two might be related?

571
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:32,115
You're right. Our family's
closer than most, more...

572
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,552
Secretive? I've noticed.

573
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:38,321
So how's she doing?

574
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,953
I have a feeling she...

575
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:44,892
We are gonna be just fine.

576
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,645
Ah!

577
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:43,389
Thank you.

578
00:50:45,828 --> 00:50:48,696
Miley, it's open mike night.
You should give it a try.

579
00:50:48,732 --> 00:50:51,360
No. Wait. It's good. I mean, my dad...

580
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:54,302
- Come on. It's all about having fun.
- No. No.

581
00:50:54,337 --> 00:50:58,034
- Travis!
- Looks like we got ourselves a taker.

582
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:07,380
All right, um...

583
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:12,252
If you guys don't mind, I'm gonna add
a little hip-hop to this hoedown.

584
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:15,519
Yeah!

585
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:18,824
All right, banjo, I'm gonna
need you to come on up here.

586
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:21,764
And where are my girls at?
Come on up.

587
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:27,500
<i>All right. Here we go.</i>

588
00:51:27,538 --> 00:51:29,733

604
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:22,526

642

Our very own Miley Stewart, people.

643
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:30,988
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

644
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:36,832
I'm sorry. I thought this was
a community event.

645
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,567
Community. You wouldn't
even know what that word means.

646
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:44,066
Well, I know that your idea
of it is a thing of the past.

647
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:48,248
How much y'all raise tonight?

648
00:54:48,283 --> 00:54:49,750
A thousand dollars?

649
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:53,050
Two thousand dollars?

650
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:55,750
Whatever it is, I'll double it.

651
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,587
We don't want your money.

652
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,491
At the end of the day
it ain't gonna matter.

653
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:01,961
You can have a hundred of these,
you ain't gonna raise the money

654
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:03,487
it's gonna take to save the Meadows,

655
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:06,159
not unless The Beatles show up
for a benefit concert.

656
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:10,069
Oh, wait. Small problem.

657
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:12,573
The sooner y'all accept the inevitable,
the sooner we...

658
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,303
Miley knows Hannah Montana.

659
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:20,143
- Who's that?
- She saved her life surfing.

660
00:55:20,182 --> 00:55:24,482
They're best friends.
She could help us out, right?

661
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,353
Throw a concert.
That would raise a ton of money.

662
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,588
Yeah! Yeah! Do it. Yeah. Call her.

663
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,652
- Yeah.
- Uh...

664
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:37,656
I guess I could give her a call.

665
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,670
Hannah Montana knows Miley?

666
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:02,116
Oh, my gosh! It's Hannah Montana!
I love you, Hannah!

667
00:56:15,774 --> 00:56:19,175
Oh, my gosh. She's here.
I didn't think she'd actually come.

668
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:23,272
Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Give me a hug. Thank you.

669
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:29,144
So rustic.

670
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,487
- I love it, Miley.
- Thanks.

671
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:35,051
This whole "pop star saves hometown"
angle is genius.

672
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,395
Not so genius that I forgive you
for ditching me in New York

673
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:41,332
and almost costing me my job,
but genius nevertheless.

674
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:48,665
So you must be Granny.

675
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:53,272
Adorable. Oh, look at this place.

676
00:56:53,314 --> 00:56:56,750
It's just so, um... And, uh...

677
00:56:56,784 --> 00:57:00,811
- It always smell like this?
- Pretty much.

678
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,046
Excuse me.

679
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:06,788
I am so sorry. You are
the best friend I have ever had.

680
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,852
When I thought
you weren't gonna talk to me,

681
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:11,956
- that I might lose you forever...
- Couldn't lose me if you wanted to.

682
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:13,729
Good, because I don't want to.

683
00:57:14,803 --> 00:57:18,432
And... sorry about
talking to that reporter guy.

684
00:57:18,473 --> 00:57:22,876
What? Lilly, you're the one that talked
to the reporter? How could you?

685
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:25,243
I thought this was one of those
"you're sorry, I'm sorry" moments.

686
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,409
It is, and I am. And I swear Hannah'll
never come between us again.

687
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:29,475
OK.

688
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,987
- Miley?
- Yeah?

689
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:34,581
Could I come in
and talk to you and Hannah?

690
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:36,455
- You be Hannah.
- No, you're Hannah.

691
00:57:36,492 --> 00:57:39,484
- I can't. No, you be Hannah. Stop it.
- Miley?

692
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:40,928
It's kind of important.

693
00:57:40,963 --> 00:57:41,987
- No.
- Back.

694
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:43,795
Stop doing this.

695
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:46,325
Stop!

696
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,702
Come in.

697
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:56,505
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

698
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:59,107
No worries. This is just
a little de-stressing.

699
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:00,776
It helps with Hannah's jet lag.

700
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:03,480
Jet lag? But California's
only two hours...

701
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,978
Yes. But Hannah only flies west to east,

702
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:10,858
so... she gains time.
She sometimes has to go

703
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:13,762
the long way around.
She's actually getting younger.

704
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:16,596
- Did you want something?
- Uh, yeah.

705
00:58:16,634 --> 00:58:18,033
Hi, Hannah.

706
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:23,097
I'm Lorelai. And we are just
all so grateful that you're here.

707
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:25,541
Oh, well...

708
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,339
Foot massage.

709
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,644
Very L.A.

710
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:33,550
- Miley, you up there?
- He doesn't know.

711
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:37,751
That Hannah's here.
He is going to be so excited.

712
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,156
- Let me tell him.
- I'll take over.

713
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:44,357
No. Hannah considers me
her personal, you know...

714
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:46,558
There's these things that... Fine.

715
00:58:48,235 --> 00:58:50,567
Hey, but no talking.

716
00:58:56,877 --> 00:59:00,278
Mmm-hmmm.

717
00:59:00,313 --> 00:59:05,341
So the mayor wants to throw this
big bash in your honor this evening.

718
00:59:05,385 --> 00:59:10,186
And I've had lobsters flown in
and everything just for you.

719
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:12,089
I hope they don't get too jet-lagged.

720
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:14,919
Anyway...

721
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:17,592
Dad!

722
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:20,567
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Fixing your grandma's gutter.

723
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:23,661
Hold the ladder for me.
And don't squish the squashes.

724
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:26,230
Please come down.
It's an emergency. I need you now.

725
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:28,800
- Is that a yes?
- Mm-hm.

726
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:33,440
Oh!
Oh, that's fantastic. Wow.

727
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,781
What is Lorelai doing
rubbing Hannah's feet?

728
00:59:36,818 --> 00:59:39,719
- Technically, they're Lilly's.
- Stay.

729
00:59:39,755 --> 00:59:43,214
Dad. Dad, we're all set.
I talked to Derrick, and...

730
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:45,227
- What's with him?
- Shh. Come here.

731
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,923
Hey. Lorelai.

732
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,990
- Why don't you let Hannah rest...
- Shh, I think she's asleep.

733
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,563
Poor thing. Jet lag.

734
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:59,234
She only flies west to east.

735
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:02,938
What? That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

736
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:05,743
Some kind of celebrity thing.

737
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:09,479
But she said yes.
She's coming to the mayor's dinner.

738
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,081
It was my job to get her there,
and she is coming.

739
01:00:15,192 --> 01:00:17,319
- Great.
- You're going, right?

740
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:21,865
I don't know.

741
01:00:21,899 --> 01:00:23,230
Is this you asking?

742
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:28,437
Yeah. I think it might be.

743
01:00:28,473 --> 01:00:30,134
Then this is me accepting.

744
01:00:35,747 --> 01:00:38,341
- I think they're gonna kiss.
- Yes!

745
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:40,284
Go, Daddy! Go, Daddy!

746
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:45,655
Whoo!

747
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:48,819
Certainly is getting hot in here.
I think I'll open up the window.

748
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,796
I don't want her
to sleep in a stuffy room.

749
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,627
Daddy, Daddy.

750
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,005
Oh, Jackson!

751
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:07,506
Are you OK? Watch it. Ladder.

752
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:09,538
Are you all right?
Let me help you.

753
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:10,743
I'm OK. I'm OK.

754
01:01:15,656 --> 01:01:17,817
Mmm.

755
01:01:17,858 --> 01:01:21,624
These taste... healthy.
What's in them?

756
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:23,588
Squash.

757
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:29,294
Ooh. I want a cowboy.

758
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,965
Sorry. That one's taken.

759
01:01:32,006 --> 01:01:33,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

760
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:36,900
No.

761
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:40,073
Maybe. I don't know. It looks like
we're going to be just friends.

762
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:42,841
But he hasn't met Hannah yet.

763
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:46,449
Come on.

764
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:54,251
So, Ha...

765
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:55,729
Ha...

766
01:01:57,533 --> 01:01:59,125
Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!

767
01:02:00,936 --> 01:02:04,269
Oh, hi. Sorry, I... I didn't see you.

768
01:02:04,306 --> 01:02:06,171
I'm Travis. Thanks for coming.

769
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:10,873
Yeah, happy to help.
This is Lilly. She's my assistant.

770
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:12,438
Executive assistant.

771
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:15,407
Welcome to Crowley Corners.

772
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:19,479
It sure would be nice to have
someone to... show us around.

773
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,046
- Real smooth.
- What?

774
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:25,586
Look, I really don't think
I'm your guy. But nice to meet you.

775
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:28,621
No, go. Go!

776
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:34,563
So... putting up a satellite dish.

777
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:37,598
It's a birdbath.

778
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,667
I knew that.

779
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:44,077
Lilly, could you go find
the owner of this fine house

780
01:02:44,116 --> 01:02:46,141
and run them through my dietary needs?

781
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:48,251
Go. Assist.

782
01:02:49,421 --> 01:02:51,286
OK.

783
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:55,656
So, you and Miley are pretty close, huh?

784
01:02:56,628 --> 01:02:57,993
You have no idea.

785
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:02,896
You don't have to answer
if you think this is too personal,

786
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:06,370
but you think she'd go out
with me if I asked?

787
01:03:06,404 --> 01:03:07,963
You want to go out with Miley?

788
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:11,403
No, you'd be a real prize.
Don't get me wrong, but...

789
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:15,579
But Miley...

790
01:03:15,615 --> 01:03:17,708
I can't help but smile
when I'm around her.

791
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:23,246
I think about her all the time. And I...

792
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,689
You should go ask her out.

793
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,385
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

794
01:03:30,297 --> 01:03:33,698
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going
to do that right now.

795
01:03:33,734 --> 01:03:35,929
No, no. No. Excuse me.

796
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:38,939
You can't go in there.
She's not home. Miley! She's not home.

797
01:03:38,973 --> 01:03:42,238
She said something about going
to the barn and brushing Blue Jeans.

798
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:45,337
You should go ask her there.
Go, go, go! Go. Goodbye.

799
01:03:46,147 --> 01:03:47,409
Go!

800
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:52,813
- Slow down, hot stuff.
- Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

801
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:56,354
Miley?

802
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:05,090
Miley! Miley, are you...?

803
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,499
Hey, slacker.

804
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:09,504
Uh, hey.

805
01:04:10,906 --> 01:04:13,466
I was just talking
to your friend, Hannah.

806
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,137
Actually, we were talking about you.

807
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:19,909
Oh, really. Was there
something you wanted to say

808
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:22,851
or ask me or talk to me about?

809
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,419
Well, I know you're going home soon.

810
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:29,220
Yeah, I am. That's right,
Travis, keep going.

811
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:32,592
Um, well...

812
01:04:32,629 --> 01:04:36,999
I was wondering if maybe you would like
to go to dinner with me this evening.

813
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:40,401
OK. Sure.

814
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:42,929
I don't think I have
any other plans, so sounds good.

815
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:46,535
- Cool.
- Cool.

816
01:04:52,316 --> 01:04:53,613
Cool.

817
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:56,211
Now you're talking.
Oh, that is the one.

818
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:58,586
Yeah, it would be,
but she's not going.

819
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,920
What do you mean I can't go?

820
01:04:59,957 --> 01:05:02,357
You're the one that promised
Lorelai that Hannah

821
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:05,591
would be the guest of honor at
the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.

822
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:08,498
- Actually, Lilly did.
- Actually, Hannah did.

823
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:10,023
But I promised Travis.

824
01:05:10,068 --> 01:05:13,162
You know what?
Then I'll just leave it up to you.

825
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,968
You do whatever you think is right.

826
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,167
But...

827
01:05:38,165 --> 01:05:39,894
It's Hannah Montana!

828
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:49,937
Can I have your autograph,
Hannah Montana?

829
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:56,975
Smile.

830
01:05:58,152 --> 01:06:00,382
- Yeah!
- Perfect.

831
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:04,715
Where's Miley?
She should be here by now.

832
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:09,458
Hon, she's got
East Coast-West Nile disease.

833
01:06:09,497 --> 01:06:11,897
- That sucker's traveling.
- Yeah.

834
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:16,468
If everybody could please
take their seats.

835
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:19,633
- Yes, be seated, everybody.
- Find their place card there.

836
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:24,840
And let me just say that, honestly,

837
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,178
to have someone of your talents,

838
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:31,050
well, Miss Montana, Hannah, if you will,

839
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:36,549
your offer of a concert tomorrow to save
Crowley Meadows from such a sad fate,

840
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:41,860
well, our humble little corner
of the world can't thank you enough.

841
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:44,366
And if there's ever anything that myself

842
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:47,700
or the good people of
Crowley Corners can do for you,

843
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:51,469
anything you need,
all you have to do is...

844
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,200
Where did she go?

845
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:59,682
Need. I just need to check on my fans.

846
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,581
Hannah, Hannah...

847
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:07,080
See? But what I really need
is I need to go to the bathroom.

848
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:10,253
I need to go. Lilly,
come with me. Right now!

849
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:16,257
Makeup, clothes, it's all in there. Go.

850
01:07:19,538 --> 01:07:22,701
- I'll be right back. Cover for me.
- OK.

851
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,351
Hey.

852
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:38,789
- Sorry I'm late.
- You're not late. I was early.

853
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:42,762
- I got you these.
- Thank you.

854
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:47,526
You do know you only have one earring?

855
01:07:48,668 --> 01:07:50,033
Trendy L.A. Thing.

856
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:57,136
- I guess you're going back there soon?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

857
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:59,042
Uh...

858
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:03,680
- I'm going to go ahead and jump.
- Please jump.

859
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:07,980
- Well, Miley...
- Uh-huh.

860
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:09,319
Before you leave...

861
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:13,053
...I just...

862
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:15,494
I really want you to know
how I feel about you.

863
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:17,053
Mm-hm.

864
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,102
Um...

865
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:27,735
Is everything all right?

866
01:08:27,776 --> 01:08:31,769
I really should take this. I'm sorry,
it will just be a second. I swear.

867
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:34,408
I'll probably get better
reception in the back.

868
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,010
I got two bars. Three bars.

869
01:08:37,954 --> 01:08:39,182
Four bars!

870
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,550
Hannah.
Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

871
01:08:52,435 --> 01:08:53,459
Huh!

872
01:08:55,605 --> 01:08:58,699
Now that our guest of honor
has returned, dig in!

873
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:03,675
That's a heck of a crawdaddy, isn't it?

874
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:14,981
Oh!

875
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:20,862
So, Hannah, you must have
a lot of wonderful stories to tell.

876
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:22,264
Not really.

877
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:27,334
I mean there are just so many.

878
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,432
But I don't want this evening
to be all about me.

879
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:33,809
I mean, everybody's stories
are important, right, Jackson?

880
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:36,076
- Huh?
- You just started college.

881
01:09:36,115 --> 01:09:39,209
- Tell us about your classes.
- Yeah, my classes. Uh...

882
01:09:39,251 --> 01:09:41,344
I really like...

883
01:09:43,355 --> 01:09:45,016
I think my favorite part is...

884
01:09:46,825 --> 01:09:50,056
Dad, that your little boy
is growing up into a man.

885
01:09:50,095 --> 01:09:51,119
Oh!

886
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,094
Oops, dropped my napkin.

887
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:57,159
Harlow!

888
01:09:58,204 --> 01:10:00,001
- Harlow!
- Ow!

889
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,133
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a ferret.

890
01:10:02,175 --> 01:10:04,200
- What are you doing?
- Trying to have my first

891
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:06,711
mature relationship.
Now get back up there.

892
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:10,940
Found it.

893
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:25,225
Um...

894
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:31,667
- I'm having the lobster.
- It's not on the menu.

895
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:32,969
Right.

896
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:45,646
Sorry. It's been a weird
couple of days, but...

897
01:10:45,687 --> 01:10:47,882
Yeah.

898
01:10:47,923 --> 01:10:51,324
And I think I know some of
the things you want to tell me.

899
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:56,288
Yeah?

900
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:59,323
There are so many things
I want to tell you, too, and...

901
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:04,666
That's just going to have to wait.

902
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:06,698
I need to go double-check
on my lobsters.

903
01:11:52,424 --> 01:11:56,258
- Club soda will take that out.
- Sit! That's enough.

904
01:11:56,294 --> 01:11:58,592
No one is getting up
from this table. No one.

905
01:11:59,397 --> 01:12:01,161
Dessert, anyone?

906
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,566
I'm sure you've all heard
of baked Alaska.

907
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:05,695
We give you Tennessee flambe.

908
01:12:10,276 --> 01:12:13,177
Mr. Mayor, I assume that
you'd like to say a few final words?

909
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:15,272
Oh, yes, yes.

910
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:19,342
Not many people know that the Tennessee
flambe was actually invented by...

911
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:31,864
Come here.

912
01:12:31,899 --> 01:12:33,924
- Mr. Mayor!
- I got you now.

913
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:39,534
Harlow!

914
01:12:47,482 --> 01:12:48,779
We got a fire!

915
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:55,049
Dang flam it!

916
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,011
This has all gone very well.
Don't you think?

917
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,589
Sorry, excuse me. Excuse me.

918
01:14:24,517 --> 01:14:26,212
Travis, please let me explain.

919
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:29,085
Explain what?

920
01:14:29,122 --> 01:14:31,716
That you've been making fun of me?

921
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:34,693
Laughing at me?
Lying to me this whole time?

922
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,795
I was honest with you.
I told you how I felt.

923
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,825
- And I feel the same way.
- No, you don't.

924
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:45,270
Because I would have never
treated you like that.

925
01:14:45,305 --> 01:14:48,763
You know what, Miley...
Hannah, whoever you are?

926
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,800
We're done.

927
01:14:50,844 --> 01:14:53,142
Travis!

928
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,545
Travis, please.

929
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:23,576
- Did you see?
- Yeah, I saw.

930
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,550
Robby Ray,
is that you down there? Uh...

931
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:30,917
Not now, Lorelai.
I've got some family stuff going on.

932
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:35,224
I'm sorry. It's just
this whole evening was a disaster.

933
01:15:35,258 --> 01:15:40,059
I just organized the whole thing, and
then that girl comes in and ruins it.

934
01:15:40,096 --> 01:15:42,087
I don't care if she is here
for a big concert.

935
01:15:42,132 --> 01:15:45,590
She's got a complicated life.
I know it's hard to understand, but...

936
01:15:46,603 --> 01:15:48,298
What's going on, Robby Ray?

937
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:53,105
I really don't have any time
for secrets and lies.

938
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:56,773
I don't know if I could be happy with
somebody comfortable living in them.

939
01:15:56,814 --> 01:15:58,714
I know. You shouldn't have to be.

940
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:01,812
I should have told you the truth.

941
01:16:03,588 --> 01:16:05,818
The truth is that...

942
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:12,123
...I just don't have any place in
my life for a relationship right now.

943
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:15,497
There's no room. Miley and me,
we've got to sort through some things.

944
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:20,699
And she needs me.
And I kind of need to be there for her.

945
01:16:23,175 --> 01:16:24,540
I'm sorry.

946
01:16:26,512 --> 01:16:28,173
Well, me too then.

947
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:31,309
Me too.

948
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:40,889
Hannah.
Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

949
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:23,697
Hey, caterpillar.

950
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:25,700
Thanks.

951
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:27,700
No problem.

952
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:40,544
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. You?

953
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:43,583
No.

954
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:49,497
- How's the song coming?
- I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

955
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,294
What's it about?

956
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,494
You.

957
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:55,965
Me.

958
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:58,698
Us.

959
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:02,273
Can I hear it?

960
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:24,496
<i># You tucked me in, turned out the light</i>

961
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:28,097

01:19:15,656 --> 01:19:17,783

- Yes! What?

987
01:21:07,173 --> 01:21:08,640
Miley!

988
01:21:09,576 --> 01:21:11,305
- Are you OK?
- Don't you know better

989
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:14,074
than to yell at someone asleep
on top of a chicken coop?

990
01:21:14,114 --> 01:21:15,581
I do now.

991
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:20,175
Did you do this?
Were you out here all night?

992
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,779
Just a little hard work. That's all.

993
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:25,189
Life's a climb.

994
01:21:30,932 --> 01:21:32,126
Is it time?

995
01:21:33,634 --> 01:21:34,862
Yeah, it's time.

996
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:37,197
Let's go.

997
01:21:44,946 --> 01:21:46,504
Hey!

998
01:21:46,547 --> 01:21:49,015
We received a
one-thousand-dollar contribution

999
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:51,747
- from an anonymous benefactor!
- We're getting there.

1000
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,414
Oh, hey.

1001
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:56,447
Isn't it awesome? This is terrific!
See you at the concert.

1002
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:13,605
- Coming through. Coming through.
- Stay back!

1003
01:22:13,643 --> 01:22:16,578
I'm not the agent,
I'm not the manager, I'm the grandma.

1004
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:19,172
- I'm the real deal.
- She's OK.

1005
01:22:24,188 --> 01:22:25,553
Have a good day, ma'am.

1006
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:30,282
Whew, honey. I had no idea.

1007
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:32,921
No wonder they hide you away
in this camper thingie.

1008
01:22:32,963 --> 01:22:35,557
Whoo! Oh!

1009
01:22:35,599 --> 01:22:37,430
Is it always this crazy?

1010
01:22:37,935 --> 01:22:39,334
Always.

1011
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:44,535
Well, I know the getting here was hard,
but what you're doing is a good thing.

1012
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:46,008
You should be proud of that.

1013
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:52,080
I know I am.

1014
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:05,262
This was my mom's?

1015
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:09,459
Yeah.

1016
01:23:10,436 --> 01:23:12,461
She'd be proud of you too.

1017
01:23:15,441 --> 01:23:16,635
Yeah.

1018
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,042
Thanks.

1019
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:26,010
Um, I'm just gonna
put it in here so I can...

1020
01:23:26,053 --> 01:23:29,147
So I can have it in my pocket
with my show and everything.

1021
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:31,089
That's good, close to you.

1022
01:23:32,426 --> 01:23:34,656
Thank you. I love you.

1023
01:23:35,629 --> 01:23:37,119
I love you, darling.

1024
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:06,359
Hannah!
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1025
01:24:16,772 --> 01:24:18,433
Ya! Ya!

1026
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,012
Yeah!

1027
01:24:27,951 --> 01:24:29,475
Whoo!

1028
01:25:34,187 --> 01:25:35,552
I can't do this.

1029
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:43,558
Sorry.

1030
01:25:52,306 --> 01:25:56,800
I've loved being Hannah, but I
just don't think I can do it anymore.

1031
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:02,113
At least not here, not with you guys.

1032
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:05,917
See, this is... this is home.

1033
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:11,916
This is where I'm from. This is family.

1034
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,054
And there's only so many sacrifices
you can ask a family to make.

1035
01:26:19,768 --> 01:26:22,328
The last time I stood
on this stage I was six.

1036
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:27,238
I was...

1037
01:26:31,347 --> 01:26:32,712
I was just Miley.

1038
01:26:41,357 --> 01:26:42,688
And I still am.

1039
01:26:57,974 --> 01:26:59,168
Hi. It's...

1040
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:02,036
It's me.

1041
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:14,751
I've hurt a lot of people,
but... I didn't mean to.

1042
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:18,229
And... if it's not too late...

1043
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:21,462
...I sure would like
a second chance.

1044
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,975
I know you all came
to hear Hannah, but...

1045
01:27:39,084 --> 01:27:41,552
...if you don't mind,
I've written y'all a song.

1046
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:43,611
It's kind of personal.

1047
01:27:43,655 --> 01:27:46,989
It's about what I've learned
over the last couple weeks.

1048
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:51,662
Life's a climb.

1049
01:27:55,301 --> 01:27:56,666
But the view is great.

1050
01:32:01,827 --> 01:32:06,264
- Whoo!
- Yeah. Whoo!

1051
01:32:24,117 --> 01:32:25,948
Thanks for letting me live my Hannah.

1052
01:32:28,521 --> 01:32:29,681
Bye.

1053
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,056
Please.

1054
01:32:33,093 --> 01:32:35,653
Please be Hannah.
We'll keep your secret.

1055
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:41,801
I'm sorry, I can't. It's too late.

1056
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,928
Sure, you can!

1057
01:32:47,274 --> 01:32:50,937
Put the wig back on. You'll never
have a normal life if you don't!

1058
01:32:50,978 --> 01:32:53,606
Hannah's a part of you!
Don't let her go!

1059
01:32:55,216 --> 01:32:58,880
Hannah!
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1060
01:33:24,647 --> 01:33:25,773
No, please.

1061
01:33:28,151 --> 01:33:30,813
- Somebody, stop him!
- Call security!

1062
01:33:33,856 --> 01:33:36,825
Watch it! One more step
and I hit "send. "

1063
01:33:36,859 --> 01:33:38,884
- Don't do it.
- Sorry, nothing on Earth'll

1064
01:33:38,928 --> 01:33:41,227
- stop me from...
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1065
01:33:41,265 --> 01:33:43,130
Phoebe, Clarissa, what are you doing?

1066
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:46,534
This nice lady sorted it all out.
Two free tickets.

1067
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,367
Upper class. It was brilliant!

1068
01:33:48,405 --> 01:33:51,340
I thought the girls'd appreciate
a couple of free tickets.

1069
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,138
We too late?
She going to sing again?

1070
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:55,544
I can't believe that
I'm only one degree away...

1071
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,913
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1072
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:01,475
- My gosh! It's Hannah Montana!
- It's really her!

1073
01:34:01,519 --> 01:34:03,510
- You're right there! I'm here!
- I can't believe it!

1074
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:06,319
I really love you.
We're your biggest fans ever, really.

1075
01:34:06,357 --> 01:34:08,757
You're not going to destroy
their dreams, are you?

1076
01:34:08,793 --> 01:34:10,352
That's what Hannah's all about.

1077
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:15,259
- Is that your story?
- I must be dreaming! Pinch me!

1078
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:18,168
No, that's not my story.

1079
01:34:18,204 --> 01:34:20,798
- Oh, my gosh!
- Girls!

1080
01:34:23,109 --> 01:34:25,805
<i>- Get this down, Lucinda.
- Fire away, Ozzie.</i>

1081
01:34:25,845 --> 01:34:28,040
<i>Bon Chic magazine</i>

1082
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:32,744
is run by a wretched, soulless succubus
who preys on the misfortune of others,

1083
01:34:32,785 --> 01:34:35,185
and I'm not going
to put up with it any longer!

1084
01:34:35,221 --> 01:34:37,121
<i>Ozzie! Ozzie! Come...</i>

1085
01:34:37,156 --> 01:34:38,453
Think I just quit.

1086
01:34:41,294 --> 01:34:44,957
Come on. Let's go out front.
I think Hannah's got more songs in her.

1087
01:34:44,998 --> 01:34:46,795
Thanks, partner.

1088
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:48,994
<i>- Everybody, stay where you are.
- Miley!</i>

1089
01:34:49,035 --> 01:34:51,765
<i>We got lots more music for you.</i>

1090
01:34:51,805 --> 01:34:55,139
Remember that crush I had
on you, and I said I was over it?

1091
01:34:55,176 --> 01:34:56,200
Yeah.

1092
01:34:58,012 --> 01:34:59,570
Uh...

1093
01:34:59,614 --> 01:35:00,842
Please jump.

1094
01:35:07,321 --> 01:35:08,686
So not over it.

1095
01:35:13,896 --> 01:35:15,921
Right on!

1096
01:36:31,476 --> 01:36:34,912
Hey.

1097
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:22,515
And cut it!
