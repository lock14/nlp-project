RUSSELL: "Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?
CARL: Don't touch that! You'll soil it.
We needed a place for Carl
to get stuck with this kid,
with no hope of pawning him off on
the nearest policeman or social worker.
And we saw this documentary
by this guy named Adrian Warren,
about these amazing
tabletop mountains, called tepuis,
jutting up out of the jungle.
ADRIAN WARREN:
These mountains are peculiar
in that they're pretty much flat-topped,
isolated from the surrounding
landscape by cliffs that
may be 2,000, 3,000 feet in height.
It's really enormous.
DOCTER: There are something like
120 of these mountains.
They're so inaccessible and remote
that, to this day, over half of them have
never been set foot on by humans.
We have a story where this character
goes to the extremes of the Earth.
Out, disconnected from the rest
of the world, and we've never had that.
MARK NIELSEN: All of act two takes
place in Venezuela, in South America,
and we could make it up
or we could actually go there
and see what it's like
so we could really be influenced by it.
Pete came to me and says,
"We're going there."
I'm like, "No, we're not!" He's like,
"Yeah, we are!" And then we did.
DOCTER: Adrian Warren set up
the whole trip and came along with us.
Just getting to the place
was an adventure.
NIELSEN: It takes about a day
to get from the San Francisco
Bay Area to Caracas,
in Venezuela, which is
where we stayed our first night.
PETERSON: The next morning we took
a flight from Caracas to Barcelona
and then onto Puerto Ordaz.
WARREN: And then from there we took
a small aircraft to Santa Elena,
a long, long, long way south.
RICKY NIERVA:
Is this Hotel Gran Sabana?
Enjoy, because tomorrow
you're not going to sleep on a bed.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
WARREN: Then next day, we drove
to an Indian village called Paraitepui.
NIELSEN: It's about a two-hour drive
from Santa Elena,
second hour's on a really rough
dirt road with lots of potholes.
WARREN: And from there
we were picked up
by the helicopter to ferry us
to the base of Roraima.
We could have landed
on top of Roraima,
but I decided to make them walk
from the bottom of the cliffs
to give them a bit more
of an adventurous experience.
PETERSON: And we finally got there
and here's this looming
giant block of rock coming...
DOCTER: Yeah,
it was really foreboding.
It's this dark thing
that shoots up out of the ground.
-"We're climbing that?"
- Yeah.
It looked like "Oh, no, you're not!"
You're trying to relate your size cues
to this thing.
And then Adrian Warren
starts to point out,
"Oh, look, there are some people
"who already started
to make their trip up."
And then somewhere on the face
of this tepui,
you see these kind of like salt specks.
"Those are people?"
After everyone was gathered,
we put our backpacks on
and started climbing up Roraima,
from about 6,300 feet
up to about 8,900 feet.
DOCTER: The trip up was like six hours
of StairMaster, you know?
'Cause nothing was
just a straight path,
everything was over roots
and down into mud and up,
and step by step, it was finding a place
to put your foot that wouldn't slip.
BRYN IMAGIRE:
It was so steep in certain areas,
it was like I had to use my arms
to pull myself up.
It was a lot harder,
I think, than any of us thought.
We had our humungous big boots on,
our GORE-TEX, everything, you know.
The guides, on the other hand,
they had flip-flops.
NIERVA: Emilio, he was wearing socks
and slippers that were two sizes
too small for him that he actually
borrowed from his girlfriend.
He climbed Roraima with that,
and walked through
all the other stuff with that.
(PANTING)
DOCTER:
And what you're climbing up past
are millions upon millions of years of
sediment layered on top of each other.
You could see ancient seabeds
of, like, the sand
in those wavy lines
from pre-dinosaur times, you know.
It's supposedly some of
the oldest exposed rock on the planet.
And then you'll come out of a clearing
and you'll look down,
and it's the whole world,
yawns before you.
I just never will forget coming over
a rise thinking we were close
and looking down
and then just my head went up,
realized that last climb
was 1,000 feet on rocks
that could sort of tumble down,
and I just cried.
- Right there.
- Right there?
Yeah.
NIERVA: When we got to the top
for the first time,
it was one of the most amazing feelings
I've ever had,
the sense of achievement,
'cause you realize,
"Wow, I did something like that."
The next morning and you look out at it,
you just can't believe this place.
It's amazing.
NIELSEN: These tepuis are surrounded
on all sides by these 2,000-foot cliffs,
and it's just an exhilarating feeling.
PETERSON: You inch over and
you look down, and it's a mile down.
DOCTER: Yeah.
PETERSON:
And it just... It's so far down.
Scared myself.
You can't capture how scary it is to be
looking down over the edge.
There's no handrails
or safety equipment,
like, you're not attached
to any ropes or anything.
You're basically on the edge,
looking straight down.
You can get a sense of it,
but there's nothing like
your own life being in danger
to really heighten that sensation.
WARREN:
The tepuis consist of sandstone
which is several thousand feet thick,
laid down as lakebed sediments.
DOCTER: This used to be,
millions and millions of years ago,
the surface of the ground.
WARREN: And at that time,
South America
was joined to West Africa.
And then about 150 million years ago,
South America drifted across
westwards
and bumped into the Pacific Plate,
which pushed up the Andes.
But it also pushed up this sandstone
in a sort of blister shape.
And then weathering did the rest.
And we're left with these standing
shapes which are the tepuis now.
I was thinking that
it was going to be like a table,
or, you know, a plateau or something,
and that you would be able
to see across to the other side,
but you get up there and it's...
You see rock formations go on and on.
NIELSEN: The landscape
on top of these tepuis,
it's like nothing I'd ever seen before,
or even thought existed.
STEVE MAY: It felt like
you were on the moon.
DOCTER: It was the closest to being
on Mars that I think I'll ever get.
LOU ROMANO: It felt like we went back
in time into some kind of mythical land.
And all these rocks,
they have these strange shapes.
There was some shapes of turtles,
there's the shape
of what looks like a Mexican with
a sombrero sitting by the campfire.
NIERVA: There's dinosaurs,
there's a monkey
eating an ice cream cone,
there's rocks teetering
on, like, a little spindle.
DOCTER: We said there's no way
if we put this in the film
that I would believe it.
It looks like the whole thing's
going to fall over, you know.
I would design some more support
under that rock
if this were in the computer,
and yet there it is in real life, so...
And it's because of
the sandstone being in different layers,
some of which is harder
and some which is softer.
Of course, the softer rock wears away
by the wind and the rain more quickly,
so you get these
very, very strange sculptures.
PETERSON: This place does feel
old and forgotten
and it feels like the perfect place.
Maybe that's why these feel right,
all these rock slabs that
are all at different angles,
is that it feels like it's falling apart,
that it's really super old.
Yeah, and since it's sedimentary,
it feels like it's wrinkles.
Feels like it's an old man itself.
These tepuis are so tall,
they kind of say that
they make their own weather systems.
WARREN: One side will heat up
by the sun quite quickly in the morning
and form these swirling clouds
which cap the top of the mountain.
What I wasn't expecting
was the rapid pace
that it can be totally sunny
and then you're in a cloud,
and then it's gone and it's sunny,
and then it comes back and it's raining,
and it happens really fast.
You're trying to paint something.
You start it, you start, you look down,
you're painting, painting,
and then you look up. Clouds.
NIELSEN: Hey, where'd Roraima go?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Gone.
DOCTER: There's a sense you get
just as a human by going somewhere
and smelling and feeling
and being there
that you can never get
in a book or a movie.
NIERVA: You got to smell it,
you got to taste it,
you got to be there
to get the real-ness of it.
Scale, you can't really understand
in a photograph,
because usually
it's like the plants are all close up
and the rocks far away,
but then when you think about
everything together in a landscape,
the plants are just really small
and insignificant.
NIELSEN: And 80% of them exist only
on top of these tepuis,
so it's all new.
It's things you've never seen before.
When you see them in the photos
they just look like cactus,
or, you know,
something that you already know.
But when you actually
feel some of those, like the Stegolepis,
it's so thick, it's like a piece of plastic.
I think because
they have to be so hardy,
and retain so much water
within themselves.
There's not much soil
on top of a lot of these mountains.
It only settles in little gullies.
PETERSON:
And from that little bit of soil,
you'll have as many plants
as it could support.
- DOCTER: Yeah.
- It just felt like we were
looking around at a flower shop.
Like little Japanese ikebana
or little Japanese gardens.
PETERSON: Everything just seemed to
be arranged by somebody up there.
DOCTER: Yeah, it was beautiful.
WARREN: We walked all over Roraima,
we went to the edge
so could look across to Kukenan
across this beautiful forested valley.
We walked up to the Valley of Crystals,
the whole valley,
it's covered in quartz crystals.
I took them to a sinkhole.
The way it's eroded, it looks like pillars.
And they would suddenly sit down
and say, "Okay, we're going to stop
here," and make a lot of drawings.
If I have a time to draw something,
even if the drawing is lousy,
it somehow sits in my head more.
Like, there's something about
the act of putting it on paper
that makes me experience it
more vividly.
WARREN: It was an interesting
experience for me
because they would gaze
in wonder at something
and want to examine it in fine detail.
To feel it
and make beautiful watercolors
and ask
very different kinds of questions.
What you pull out of the experience
as an artist
is essentially what
you're trying to show the audience.
And that means that
what we localize on,
and what you can feature
is very important
while you're there in the location.
Their sketches really tell you
a lot about who they are,
what they look for,
and what's important in the landscape.
Ronnie Del Carmen's
had a real emotional, colorful quality
to what he did.
Don and Nat were looking at
wonderful rhythm
of structures of things.
Lou was looking
for the whimsy of things.
And Bryn, you could tell,
she was really keyed into
the beautiful textures she was seeing.
We modeled some rocks
and painted them
so that you could really see
the lichen deposits
and all the mineral deposits,
things that are stuck onto the rock
and it was really helpful
in getting that look into the movie.
Darn thing!
DOCTER: There are certainly very
specific things that ended up in the film.
There are these cave walls that have
been carved by water rushing past,
that we ended up
using for Muntz's cave.
You know, the same sort of feel
of this erosion.
PETERSON:
And coming out of the mist
and thinking you're looking at a person,
but really it's a rock shape.
I mean, that really happened.
Hey.
(SNICKERS) You were talking to a rock.
NIERVA: Also, Muntz's lair,
all the rocks around
the entryway of that cave
were influenced by
the Kukenan tepui that we visited.
PETERSON: There is another tepui
next to Roraima called Kukenan
and we decided
that we would go there.
WARREN: But, of course,
you've got thousands of feet of cliffs
and impossible landscape in between.
So, we did it by helicopter,
which sounds easy enough,
but of course you can't carry
many people in a helicopter.
So, we all took turns shuttling over
to the top of Kukenan.
And the plan was for us to just spend
an hour, maybe two hours there,
exploring that summit a little bit.
There's nowhere to land on this tepui,
except for certain little islands
in the middle of these vast stretches
of crazy rocks and marsh.
MAY: And when you get there,
it's just all rock.
Almost none of those little plants
or anything that looks like
anything besides rock.
DOCTER: Most of the time up there
it was just dead silent, nothing.
No birds, just the sound of wind.
IMAGIRE: They said that less than
probably 100 people
have ever visited there.
WARREN:
It's an extremely dangerous mountain.
But it's such a labyrinth of rocks
it's easy to get lost,
and several people
have disappeared without a trace.
DOCTER: And these rock shapes
are just very hostile
and it's almost like you have
the feeling you're being watched.
WARREN: Kukenan, for the Indians,
always seemed to have
the edge on Roraima
as being the home of evil spirits,
or mischievous spirits, actually,
they prefer to say.
They'll catch you unawares.
NIERVA: So, it's raining on Kukenan
and we found this little alcove here.
Here's Nat.
We're waiting for the helicopter.
There's Bryn in her trash bag skirt.
Very effective for rain.
(IMAGIRE LAUGHS)
NIELSEN: After a few hours,
the helicopter began coming up
to shuttle people off the mountain.
After the first two groups, a storm
started to close in around Kukenan,
and the helicopter is unable to get up
there in the middle of a storm,
it's just not safe.
PETERSON: So six of us were actually
able to get down from the mountain,
but another six were stuck up there
as a storm closed in.
McLAUGHLIN: And it rained harder
than I've ever seen it rain
ever in my entire life, I swear.
So you're 5,000, 6,000 feet up,
freezing cold rain,
40-mile-per-hour winds, you know...
NIELSEN: And there's very little shelter
to be found on Kukenan.
There was about two places
that we were able to find
where someone could stand
underneath a rock,
the biggest of which we had been
referring to that afternoon as The Lou.
I had to use the bathroom,
and, you know,
when you're in those environments
you just go where you can.
It just ended up that that was
where everyone then went to huddle
when it was raining.
So they called it The Lou,
because loo is toilet in England,
and my name's Lou, so...
And this cave was
like the size of a phone booth.
We were just all squeezed in there
together, standing on rocks,
'cause it was even wet
around the rocks inside this little cave.
NIELSEN: We literally saw ponds
and lakes forming
as far out as we could see
that weren't there before.
All these rock shapes turned into
these amazing water sculptures
where everything,
it's just one big waterfall.
Sometimes the storm doesn't last long,
but that day the storm went
round and round in circles
and got worse and worse.
Then the longer we waited
the more I thought,
"We're going to be stuck here overnight
and it's gonna suck."
NIELSEN: There was no place
on this tepui to pitch a tent
so we would have just been
standing or sitting in The Lou,
in our sleeping bags all night.
We're getting desperate,
we started looking for more shelter
and then we heard the helicopter.
NIELSEN: Thankfully,
with 15 minutes of daylight remaining,
the helicopter returned
and we were able to get off
the mountain before nightfall.
And we were very grateful.
McLAUGHLIN:
I did a couple of paintings
to try and capture what it felt like being
stuck in a rainstorm on top of Kukenan.
(MUTTERING)
it was a real relief to get off of Kukenan,
but we knew the next day that
we had to kind of continue our journey.
So the next morning
we took a very small plane,
went to a small town called Canaima,
and from Canaima
we took motorized canoes
up a river all day to get to Angel Falls.
There was this beautiful open vista
where we could look up at Angel Falls.
It was always cloudy.
It's hard to draw when it's cloudy.
And we woke up really early,
it was still dark,
you could hear it
but you couldn't see it,
and then, slowly, the play of light,
the way it changed
as the light came up,
and then it would become
completely in clouds
and then it would peek out again.
That was a cool morning,
just sitting and watching
and trying to capture that on paper.
MAY: We climbed
to the base of the waterfall.
The scale of it is just... It's amazing.
Angel Falls is the tallest waterfall
in the world.
It's so tall that the water actually
vaporizes before it hits the bottom.
So, it doesn't really have this kind of
crashing Niagara Falls at the bottom,
it just vaporizes into this mist
that collects and forms
these kind of more gentle falls.
Our waterfall is actually three times
taller than Angel Falls.
Just to make it beautiful
and have enormous scale for Carl
when he goes to see it.
DOCTER: That seems about right.
When we got back we were like,
"if we could survive this trip,
"the movie will seem so easy after this."
DOCTER: We have this catalog
of all these great plants
and rocks and things,
and we could
kind of put them together
in whatever way we wanted
to make the ultimate tepui.
What was really cool was
it started being less about
how does it look, what does it look like,
what's it literally made of,
and more about what does it feel like.
DEL CARMEN:
There's shorthands that happen.
There are certain words
and experiences
that people say, "Yes, exactly.
I know what that means."
MAY: When we make those images
on the computer
and they look and feel
like that place felt,
that's when we know
we've kind of done our job.
It felt like we sort of earned
the idea of using a tepui in our film.
NIELSEN: Is that our hiking start point,
right there?
NIERVA: Yeah, that's it.
DOCTER: And beyond
all of the amazing things we saw
and the photographs and the detail
that we were able to observe
and hopefully capture in the film,
I think what we walked away with
was the feeling that we'd been
on the same journey as Carl had.
We had experienced
this amazing place,
seen things no one's ever seen,
and in doing so, it was really
kind of a wild adventure for us.
