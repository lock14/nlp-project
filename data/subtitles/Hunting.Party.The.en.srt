00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,015
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

4
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,450
<i>I used to carry
a rabbit's foot for good luck.</i>

5
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,587
<i>But in Somalia,
I traded it for two cold Budweisers</i>

6
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:25,147
<i>and a back issue of Penthouse.</i>

7
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:28,727
<i>You hear people talk
about the horrors of war all the time,</i>

8
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:31,063
<i>but the dirty little secret is,</i>

9
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,731
<i>if you're just reporting it,</i>

10
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,461
<i>war has its bright side as well.</i>

11
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,237
<i>I know, I know. I'm sacrilegious.</i>

12
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,875
<i>But being that close to death,</i>

13
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:42,608
<i>being that alive,</i>

14
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:44,643
<i>it's completely addictive.</i>

15
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:48,818
<i>And if anyone tells you otherwise,
they are lying.</i>

16
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,382
Fuck!

17
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,389
I know.

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,795
<i>I worked with Simon Hunt for nine years.</i>

19
00:01:56,698 --> 00:02:00,326
<i>We worked as a team
for the network news covering wars</i>

20
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:05,776
<i>from El Salvador to Desert Storm
to the killing fields of Bosnia.</i>

21
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,103
Are we moving or what?

22
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,738
Yes, we're moving.

23
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:14,273
I just wish I had a fucking Quaalude.

24
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:16,918
<i>No one was crazier than he was.</i>

25
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,580
<i>No one was as dangerous,</i>

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,684
<i>as fun, or as good as he was.</i>

27
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,020
Damn!

28
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,750
<i>Even in the very worst of times.</i>

29
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:36,834
God damn it.

30
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,439
You film any of that?

31
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:47,640
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,178
<i>Well, what the hell are we doing here,
writing for Travel and fucking Leisure?</i>

33
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,715
We're here for one purpose
and one purpose only,

34
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,983
and that's to get some
goddamn news footage here.

35
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,420
That's why you're going to go back out
into this mess and shoot something.

36
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,654
Ridiculous.

37
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,664
Afraid not, Duckie Boy.

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Okay. You film it.

39
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,495
- No, you fucking film it.
- You fucking film it.

40
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:10,731
I don't know how to use
the fucking camera.

41
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,232
Screw me.

42
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,897
<i>Simon gave me balls
I never even knew I had.</i>

43
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:19,639
<i>Of course, during our years together
I got shot four times,</i>

44
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:23,049
<i>and Simon never got
as much as a scratch.</i>

45
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:26,246
<i>But together we won lots of awards.</i>

46
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,015
<i>Simon liked to point out, however,</i>

47
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>that news awards were like hemorrhoids:</i>

48
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:34,237
<i>Eventually, every asshole gets one.</i>

49
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:38,092
<i>But the fact was
Simon was the best in the business,</i>

50
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>and everyone knew it.</i>

51
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,603
<i>He cared the most.</i>

52
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:44,140
<i>He got the best stories.</i>

53
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:50,772
<i>But things started to change
during the winter of 1994 in Bosnia.</i>

54
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:54,676
<i>All the senseless brutality
of every war we had covered</i>

55
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:58,511
<i>crystallized in one perfect
winter of tragedy.</i>

56
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,083
<i>And then one day Simon snapped.</i>

57
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,923
<i>I guess everyone snaps
once in their lifetime:</i>

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,725
<i>At a boss...</i>

59
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:12,326
<i>at a lover...</i>

60
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,029
<i>at the world.</i>

61
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,440
<i>But Simon's was a doozy.</i>

62
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,739
<i>And I filmed it all,</i>

63
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>recording it for every journalism major</i>

64
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,550
<i>to download from here to fucking eternity.</i>

65
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:31,246
<i>We now go to Simon Hunt
in Bosnia with the story.</i>

66
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,014
<i>Two years into a civil war</i>

67
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:36,085
<i>that has ravaged
this once multi-ethnic country,</i>

68
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,186
<i>Doctor Boghanovic's Bosnian Serb army</i>

69
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:42,757
<i>continues in its quest to liquidate
the Bosnian Muslims from this region,</i>

70
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:47,462
<i>today attacking yet another
supposed UN-protected village at will.</i>

71
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,797
<i>Simon, some are saying</i>

72
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:51,499
<i>that it was the Bosnian Muslims
who attacked first,</i>

73
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,804
<i>causing this latest battle.</i>

74
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:01,043
<i>- Simon, some are saying...
- It wasn't a battle, Franklin.</i>

75
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,512
<i>It wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.</i>

76
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:06,983
<i>Well, Simon, certain
United Nations observers confirm...</i>

77
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:08,084
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

78
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:11,756
<i>Are you talking about the Dutch?</i>

79
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,723
<i>The Dutch?</i>

80
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,925
<i>The Dutch were getting drunk</i>

81
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:18,294
<i>with the Serb army guys on slivovice</i>

82
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,563
<i>at the checkpoint earlier this morning.</i>

83
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:23,332
<i>- Okay, thank you, Simon Hunt...
- Safe areas?</i>

84
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,636
<i>These people were butchered!</i>

85
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,069
<i>Women were raped!</i>

86
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,971
<i>Children were murdered!</i>

87
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:31,074
<i>Oh, come on, Franklin!</i>

88
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,810
<i>Come on, don't get your panties
all in a twist.</i>

89
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,379
<i>- We're live, Simon.
- Lathered up.</i>

90
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,482
<i>You and your editor boys,
you can cut this part out of air.</i>

91
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,787
<i>Timid little network cunts.</i>

92
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:47,057
<i>There have been many distinguished
moments in television history.</i>

93
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,107
<i>This wasn't one of them.</i>

94
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,674
<i>After that, everything changed.</i>

95
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:00,743
<i>Simon, of course, got canned.</i>

96
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,712
<i>And I, on the other hand,</i>

97
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:12,632
<i>received the opposite end
of the network spear.</i>

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
<i>I got promoted.</i>

99
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,589
<i>Guess a little reward for having to endure</i>

100
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,725
<i>the embarrassment that was Simon Hunt</i>

101
00:06:21,735 --> 00:06:23,896
<i>for all those years.</i>

102
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,565
<i>I got sent to New York and was offered
the cushiest job in the business:</i>

103
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,738
<i>Chief cameraman for Franklin Harris,</i>

104
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:35,010
<i>the network anchorman.</i>

105
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:38,746
<i>I suddenly had what
everyone else wanted:</i>

106
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,645
<i>World capitals,</i>

107
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,080
<i>state dinners,</i>

108
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,253
<i>first-class jets.</i>

109
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:49,661
<i>And I took advantage
of every gift bag they gave me.</i>

110
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
<i>Simon had it harder.</i>

111
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:58,028
<i>- Much harder.
- Simon Hunt here in Northern Gaza.</i>

112
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,566
<i>He stumbled through
a half dozen cable news jobs,</i>

113
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:04,551
<i>one more demeaning than the next...</i>

114
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,306
What the fuck are you doing?

115
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,375
<i>...which usually ended with him quitting</i>

116
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:13,411
<i>or getting fired for insubordination.</i>

117
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:16,181
Got great tape!
Great, great tape!

118
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:19,717
<i>Finally he hit the bottom rung
of a journalist's career:</i>

119
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:23,287
<i>Showing up at a war
on nobody's dime but his own.</i>

120
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,756
$500.

121
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,224
I'll take five hundred.

122
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,826
A world exclusive.

123
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:30,804
Don't you owe me
300 from Gaza?

124
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,374
<i>It's a shitty life.</i>

125
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:39,438
<i>Soon after that, I stopped hearing
from Simon altogether.</i>

126
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:42,808
<i>And then he dropped
completely off the radar.</i>

127
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,977
<i>There were rumors of spottings</i>

128
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:48,847
<i>in certain war zones
you wouldn't even want to fly over.</i>

129
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:51,985
<i>Stories like that.</i>

130
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,688
<i>And then slowly...</i>

131
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:56,763
<i>the stories stopped.</i>

132
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,734
<i>As for me?</i>

133
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:02,669
<i>Did I miss the action?</i>

134
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:06,498
<i>Did I want to go back
to the carnage and craziness?</i>

135
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,700
<i>The adrenaline and nonstop erection</i>

136
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,204
<i>that comes from fear and death and war?</i>

137
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,282
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

138
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,809
<i>And that was the lie I lived with.</i>

139
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,434
- Watch the land mine.
- What?

140
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,401
Okay, that's not funny.

141
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,004
No, I just read there's
supposed to still be

142
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,507
over 500,000 un-detonated land mines
in this country.

143
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,408
You know, the last time I was here,

144
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:23,711
there was a sniper positioned right there

145
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:25,613
taking potshots at my ass.

146
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,215
Five-year anniversary. It's a good story.

147
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,484
Duck, you should talk
to some of your old contacts

148
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:32,494
and work with Benjamin.

149
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:35,221
I want to do something
on the reconciliation.

150
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,024
You know, Muslim and Serb widow
sort of thing.

151
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,592
- Yes, sir. It will be done.
- Good.

152
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:40,895
- Watch the land mine.
- What?

153
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:42,930
Okay, really, this isn't funny.

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,565
First overseas assignment

155
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,866
producing a piece on something

156
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,868
you seem to know very little about,

157
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,436
could be pretty damn funny.

158
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,738
Yeah, Franklin and my father

159
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:52,807
thought this would be a good
first foreign assignment for me.

160
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,642
You know, get my feet wet.

161
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:57,087
And whose kid are you again?

162
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:59,619
The network vice-president's.

163
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,049
- Oh.
- Yeah.

164
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,484
I'm trying to read everything I can,

165
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,353
but this war was complicated as all hell.

166
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,155
It was hell.

167
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:10,310
Ain't nothing complicated about that.

168
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,533
<i># Pusti, pusti, modu #</i>

169
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,603
<i># Pusti, pusti, modu #</i>

170
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,503
Look what the cat dragged in.

171
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,513
Duck!

172
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,342
He has actually graced
us with his presence.

173
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,078
And his expense account.
Drinks on the network.

174
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,579
No, it's not.
Don't listen to anything he says.

175
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,648
Hey, man.

176
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,216
Back in the trenches
with the commoners, huh?

177
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,417
- Oh, Brady, you look great.
- Good to see you, man.

178
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,653
- You look like shit, mate.
- So does your mama.

179
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,655
It's all that money and pussy.
It's fucking destroyed him.

180
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,223
Two Sarajevskas, please.

181
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,126
Excuse me if I can afford a bar of soap.

182
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,694
All y'all look like y'all need a bath.

183
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,797
Duck!

184
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:23,724
- We have a very special
guest this evening.

185
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,734
What?

186
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,569
- And she's a virgin.
- No.

187
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,873
We gonna get her fucked up!

188
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,873
Your first time,
and you're traveling with Duck?

189
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,508
I hope you brought your flak jacket.

190
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,443
Last newbie who traveled with him
lost one of his balls.

191
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,645
It's true.

192
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,480
That's why they sent the Duck
back to New York.

193
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,217
He attracts mortar fire
like shit attracts flies.

194
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,284
- Jubilee, buddy.
- Jubilee.

195
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:45,025
It's good to see you.

196
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:48,124
It's insane. NATO has 20,000
peace-keeping troops

197
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,126
in a country half the size of Kentucky,

198
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,195
and they can't find
any of these fucking war criminals.

199
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,697
There's no way this country is going
to get its economy back up

200
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,832
until it starts catching
some of these assholes.

201
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,568
Until they catch the Fox.

202
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,937
Now that would be a great story.

203
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,947
Yeah? Who's the Fox?

204
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,712
Where's that Bosnian war book
you've been reading?

205
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,914
Uh-oh.

206
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,215
It never gets old.

207
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,350
It's not pretty.

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Thank you.

209
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,856
Doctor Dragoslav Boghanovic,
the Fox,

210
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,597
is the most wanted war criminal in Bosnia.

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,896
During the war,
he ordered the rape and murder

212
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,069
of thousands of innocent Muslims.

213
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,953
There's a $5 million bounty
on his little arrogant head.

214
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,741
Oh.

215
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,109
Yeah.

216
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,112
You got everyone from the UN,

217
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,556
CIA, and NATO,

218
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:47,018
and every bounty hunter
from here to Chuck Norris

219
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,185
looking for him.

220
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:52,275
I think that poor boy needs
some slivovice quick.

221
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,858
It's good.

222
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,025
It's brandy.

223
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,894
Yeah? How good?

224
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,230
Let's put it this way.
There's an old Bosnian saying

225
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,531
that when a bottle of this stuff
is on the table,

226
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:05,196
the devil's sitting in the corner laughing.

227
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,840
You know what I was just thinking of?

228
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,076
If every day is a holiday
at the Holiday Inn...

229
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,145
- That's not your room.
- I know.

230
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,180
Then what do they do...

231
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,983
What do they do about Christmas time?

232
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,852
Look, man,
if I don't see you at breakfast,

233
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,553
I'm going to have NATO send a task force

234
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:23,755
to search for you.

235
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,761
Okay.

236
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,726
Good night, Duck.

237
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:29,026
Hey, hey, hey!

238
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,128
Duck!

239
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,330
Oh, God.

240
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Oh, God.

241
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,412
- Hello, Duckie.
- Oh, fuck!

242
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,457
Simon.

243
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,927
Surprise.

244
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,896
How the hell are you?

245
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,234
Get over here.

246
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,062
Been good.

247
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,506
Been good.
Been around.

248
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,934
Amazing how many
crappy wars you'll find

249
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,103
if you go looking for 'em.

250
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:14,514
- But you're okay?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

251
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,793
I've been getting through.

252
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,648
I hope you don't mind.
I raided your honor bar over there.

253
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:25,050
Purloined a few
of your little bottles of vodka.

254
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,718
So what else is new?

255
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:30,088
I watched you guys today
doing your report up on a bridge.

256
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,157
Franklin's not looking half bad.

257
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,193
He have some work done?

258
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,170
- Eyelift.
- Oh.

259
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,266
- But you were watching us, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:42,276
Yeah, I was...

261
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,404
I was hoping maybe I could convince you

262
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,472
to shoot my stand-up report
tomorrow at the ceremony.

263
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,747
You know, old times' sake.

264
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,287
Yeah, sure.

265
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,113
You know,
I could save a little money

266
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:58,116
if I didn't have to hire
a cameraman, so...

267
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:02,358
I'm going to sell it
to the Germans or Jamaicans.

268
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,733
Yeah.

269
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,446
Fuck, Simon.

270
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,479
You know, I meant to try
and track you down.

271
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,656
Don't worry about it.

272
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,531
Don't worry, Duck.

273
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,141
I heard rumors.

274
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,611
They're all true.

275
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,585
I got something, Duck.

276
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,215
Not just the anniversary,
I got a real story.

277
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,318
Something that could put me
right back on the map.

278
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,643
I thought you might be interested. Huh?

279
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,830
It's not like I don't want to.

280
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,933
I just...

281
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,640
You know, I'd do anything for you.

282
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,272
But I'm meeting this girl in Greece
the day after tomorrow,

283
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,841
and it's just not something
I can cancel, you know?

284
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,276
Just shitty timing.

285
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:33,417
I got this three-week vacation and all.

286
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,184
Look, but I'll still do
your stand-up tomorrow.

287
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,254
Look, l... I got to get out of here.

288
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,031
What, already?

289
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,567
Simon!

290
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,804
- Great to see you, Duck.
- Simon!

291
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,384
The white doves released
to denote peace around the world.

292
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,790
Peace especially in Sarajevo
and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

293
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,834
Simon Hunt.

294
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,329
I thought you were dead.

295
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,597
Franklin.

296
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,366
You look good.

297
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,376
Very taut.

298
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,671
Duck said you were coming by here.

299
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,008
That's fine with me
if you wanna piggyback with us.

300
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,577
- I got no hard feelings.
- Oh, thank you.

301
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,613
Thank you, Franklin.
Magnanimous as always.

302
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,915
I promise I won't try to steal Duckie back.

303
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,185
Oh, you can't afford him.
Hell, I could hardly afford him.

304
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,655
Benjamin, meet Simon Hunt,
a former star with our network.

305
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,997
Simon, Benjamin Strauss.

306
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,161
Benjamin, you look young enough
to be someone important's son.

307
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,146
Yeah. The network vice-president's.

308
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,068
You know, I thought you were dead, too.

309
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,546
What?

310
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,774
Simon used to be our best correspondent

311
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,310
till he flamed out on national television.

312
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Yeah. No, I remember.

313
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,126
I mean, we studied it
in journalism school.

314
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,562
Reporting from
the five-year anniversary ceremony

315
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:27,310
for Jamaican television,
this is Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

316
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,402
Reporting for Peruvian state television,

317
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,074
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

318
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,942
Reporting for
the Polish television news network,

319
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,247
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

320
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,481
I hope one of these bastards buys this.

321
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,516
Hope so.

322
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:49,653
Check the atlas.
I don't think you got any countries left.

323
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,388
Yeah, well,

324
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,023
considering what I got up my sleeve,

325
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,033
it won't matter much.

326
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:04,969
Hey, get this back to the hotel.
I'll meet you there later.

327
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,954
All right, daddy, what's the story?

328
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,775
You make the call?

329
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:11,975
What call?

330
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,535
To your little Greek souvlaki.

331
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,682
'Cause this story's too big to waste

332
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:23,877
if you're just going to get on a plane
like Facelift Franklin.

333
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,694
You're getting soft, Duckie.

334
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,530
You've gotten real soft
around the edges.

335
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,599
You're like a racehorse
that's been put out to pasture.

336
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, and you can fuck off, Simon.

337
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,036
But when I know that you're ready
to do serious journalism,

338
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,207
instead of that anchorman fluff
they've reduced you to,

339
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:44,217
I'll fill you in, okay?

340
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,996
What's the story, you motherfucker?

341
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:54,494
It's good.

342
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,695
It's really good.

343
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,467
What?

344
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,407
What?

345
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,284
You know the Fox?

346
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:22,151
Pompous bastard who's responsible
for all of this?

347
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,160
Yeah.

348
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,291
I know where he's hiding.

349
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:55,148
So this great source of yours
knows where he's hiding,

350
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,782
just like that?

351
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,016
Yeah. Correct.

352
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,787
And we're going to find him
and score an interview.

353
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:01,854
Correct.

354
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,523
Go where no bounty hunter

355
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,658
or U.S. Marine has ever gone before.

356
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:07,668
Correct.

357
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,345
You are out of your fucking mind.

358
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,572
Okay. What about the bodyguards
that he travels with, Simon?

359
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,208
Have you thought about that?

360
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:24,011
Yeah. Word is he's got 20
armed guards with him at all times.

361
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,812
Yeah? Well, I heard it's 50.

362
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,949
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

363
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:30,020
Maybe.

364
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,419
Actually, some people
believe he has none.

365
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,854
Stupid people.

366
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,288
Doesn't matter.

367
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:38,091
He's expecting NATO troops,
not two jerks in a car.

368
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,560
We can get right up to him.

369
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,694
I know the town.

370
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:42,428
- I have directions.
- You got directions?

371
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:45,065
What, somebody said
"Make a left at the first Quickie-Mart"?

372
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:49,336
I don't think they have
Quickie-Marts in Bosnia, Duckie.

373
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:52,439
Okay, Simon.
This great source of yours...

374
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:56,104
How do you even know
that you can trust him?

375
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:00,722
It's real.

376
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,819
He says he's hiding
up in the mountains of Celibici,

377
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,355
right by the border of Montenegro.

378
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,591
You go one step over the border,
NATO can't catch you.

379
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,925
No, no, no.

380
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:15,496
- They've been printing that gossip...
- He's there. He's in the mountains.

381
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,197
He's there! He...

382
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,199
He's an hour and a half
up an unpaved road.

383
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:22,002
He's surrounded
by sympathetic Bosnian Serbs

384
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,139
who will protect him...

385
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:26,215
at all costs.

386
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,587
That's just fucking great.

387
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:35,140
We're leaving first thing in the morning.

388
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:42,189
If you could see me in this bikini, Duck,
you wouldn't be doing this.

389
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,059
Come on. Come on, baby.

390
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:48,063
Look, it's... I promise it's just going
to be two more days, okay?

391
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,998
Oh, well, I can wait.

392
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:52,133
But I don't know for how long.

393
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,338
You're torturing me.

394
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:55,837
<i>And you're torturing me.</i>

395
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:57,847
So we're even.

396
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,343
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

397
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:07,749
I must be a complete fucking idiot.

398
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,853
Hey, look, I know I'm new
and green and a joke to you,

399
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,787
but I just graduated
from Harvard, okay?

400
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,425
And I know something's up.

401
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,859
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

402
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:21,463
Oh, come on.
You and Simon, you're onto a story.

403
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,797
Me and Simon are just hanging out.

404
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,367
I saw your girlfriend when she
came by the office two weeks ago.

405
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,701
She is hotter than hot.

406
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,281
You don't leave her in Greece to hang out.

407
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,841
You been listening to my conversations?

408
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:34,043
No.

409
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,543
No, it was, um...

410
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:39,147
No, the official term
is eavesdropping, all right?

411
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,157
Little shit.

412
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:43,986
Look, I know something's up, all right?

413
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:45,054
I want in on it.

414
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,589
Forget it. There's no story.

415
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,724
I went to Harvard, okay?
I know there's a story.

416
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,193
What is up with this Harvard shit?

417
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:52,995
You know, I dated a girl
from Harvard once,

418
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,810
and she wasn't so fucking bright.

419
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,702
Look, my father is a cold,
mean son of a bitch,

420
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,737
and he thinks I'm soft and weak

421
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,639
and not quite cut out
for this type of work.

422
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,641
And there's no way on God's green earth
I'm going to prove that to him

423
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,378
by letting you get
a great story without me.

424
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,579
How do you know it's so great?

425
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,114
You're hanging out with a guy

426
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,816
who had a fucking meltdown
on national television

427
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,284
and is a punch line in the business.

428
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:19,034
If it wasn't good, you
wouldn't be doing it.

429
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,296
Look at you.

430
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,686
Little Mike-fucking-Wallace.

431
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,344
Okay.

432
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,339
But Simon ain't going to like this.

433
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,275
Yeah?

434
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:41,175
Well, I ain't going to like Simon.

435
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:51,021
You see, his main bodyguard

436
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,324
is this psychopathic little fuck
named Srdjan.

437
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,330
He had a real fondness

438
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,529
for raping and mutilating
these very young Muslim girls

439
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,633
as he was ethnically
cleansing the villages.

440
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:05,870
- Jesus.
- Oh, that ain't the good part.

441
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,806
Shit, the good part,
Benjamin, is this Srdjan,

442
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,941
the guy in charge of protecting the Fox,

443
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,745
he's got this tattoo on his forehead
that reads in Cyrillic,

444
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:17,475
"I was dead the day I was born."

445
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,705
They teach that evil shit at Harvard?

446
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:27,458
Now, we are headed right into the heart
of this Balkan madness,

447
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:29,026
into Serb territory.

448
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,628
Republica Srpska.

449
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:31,963
It's a backward land

450
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,831
where they will kill you
for trying to hurt Boghanovic

451
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:38,102
as easily as somebody kills a mosquito.

452
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:40,112
The Fox is their god.

453
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:43,307
People protect their god.

454
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,715
Now, if you're still interested...

455
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,788
we leave in 20 minutes.

456
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,907
Let's go find us some war criminals.

457
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,840
# 20, 24 hours ago #

458
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,705
# I wanna... I wanna be #

459
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,115
# I wanna be sedated #

460
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:52,010
Hey, Benjamin, you know what that is
that we're passing?

461
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,346
Yeah, it looks like, uh, a ski lift.

462
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,784
'84 Winter Olympics
was held right here in Sarajevo.

463
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:02,421
Eight years later, the Fox used this area
as a staging ground for his snipers.

464
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,756
Won the gold medal, triple lutz.

465
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,492
Best all around scumbag.

466
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,095
Are you going to be playing that damn thing
all the way to Montenegro?

467
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,898
Yep. Simon never liked
my guitar playing.

468
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,333
Really?

469
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,343
Can't say I do, either.

470
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:19,020
So it's going to be like that, huh?

471
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,149
# 20, 20, 24 hours a day #

472
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:26,379
- All right. Very funny.
- # I want to play the damn thing #

473
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,348
So what is your master plan?

474
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,149
You have a contact when
we get to this town?

475
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,653
Nope. Never been up there before.

476
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:35,421
I'm just going to start knocking on doors.

477
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,258
You see that? Signs are in Cyrillic now.

478
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:41,361
We've entered Republica Srpska.

479
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,595
That quickly?

480
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,364
Ten minutes outside of Sarajevo,

481
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:47,434
and we're in the land
of milk and honey and rape and pillage.

482
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,836
- Are we going to be okay here?
- Who the hell knows?

483
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:54,096
But $5 million is $5 million,
and I'm not stopping.

484
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:57,077
$5 million?

485
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,911
Reward.

486
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,114
3 is for me.

487
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,182
The rest is for you guys
to split as you please.

488
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,351
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Reward?

489
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,419
You're not actually thinking
of capturing him, are you?

490
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,222
He may be thinking it,
but it ain't going to happen.

491
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,125
- Don't be so sure.
- Don't be so stupid.

492
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,796
After this interview's finished,
everything's in play, my friends.

493
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,765
Whoa. Hold on.
Duck, this is nuts.

494
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,400
You're not really supporting this, are you?

495
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,235
One time in Rwanda,

496
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,405
Simon decided he was going
to assassinate the leader of the Hutus

497
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,706
and end the war.

498
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:27,574
Three days later, he was in Morocco

499
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,610
getting a massage
from a hooker named Gladys.

500
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,714
Simon has his whims,
but this one I am not supporting.

501
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:35,115
This isn't a whim.

502
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,855
You know what this means to me.

503
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,953
Okay, we are journalists.
We can't do this.

504
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:42,590
It's... It's unethical and... and insane.

505
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,393
It would be a pleasure
to personally catch him.

506
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,661
By ourselves. By ourselves.
We don't even have any weapons.

507
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,731
If I gave you a gun,
would you know how to use it?

508
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,799
No.

509
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,549
Then what the fuck
are you complaining about?

510
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,173
I told you.

511
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,609
The moment you start drinking
that Bosnian brandy,

512
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:05,614
the devil's sitting in the corner
just laughing.

513
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,457
Do we know any actual facts at all, guys?

514
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,960
<i>My buddy at Newsweek says</i>

515
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,728
he's so afraid of getting caught

516
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:56,198
that he's grown his hair out
and has a full Orthodox beard.

517
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,834
Funny.'Cause I heard
he actually shaved his head.

518
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,844
He's bald as a turd.

519
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,008
Now, what we do know is that the Fox
drives in a convoy of orange cars.

520
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,144
All right?
So we should keep a lookout for them.

521
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,412
That's funny, Simon.
I heard he's traveling around

522
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,515
in a stolen UN de-mining vehicle.

523
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,917
Well then, we should keep
an eye out for that, too.

524
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:15,985
Yeah, that's great.

525
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,220
There's only a thousand
UN de-mining trucks in this country.

526
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,555
Why don't we stop each one?

527
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:22,224
"Hey, knock, knock.
Is the Fox in there? No?"

528
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:26,196
Okay, well, we should be done in,
what, say, 9 to 12 years.

529
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,696
One second he's pissing himself

530
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,632
'cause he's afraid we might
actually run into the Fox,

531
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:32,501
the next he's complaining
'cause we probably won't.

532
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:35,070
No, I'm not... I'm not complaining.

533
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,276
I'm mocking.

534
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:44,689
Wow.

535
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:47,258
The Doctor is not bald.

536
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:52,356
He is not desperate.

537
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,642
And he is not in Celibici.

538
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:01,066
He is everywhere.

539
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,371
He know everything.

540
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,810
He listens to everything you say.

541
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,644
And if you get close to the Fox,

542
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,717
if you corner him,

543
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:16,245
then even God can't help you.

544
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,390
What the fuck was that about?

545
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,725
A little warning.

546
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,359
Yeah? It seemed more like a threat.

547
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:33,773
Yeah. Beware of the nosy waiter
with Serbian pride.

548
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,766
Actually, it was the
first time that I thought

549
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,101
that maybe Simon wasn't
jerking our chain.

550
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,303
Yeah? Why is that?

551
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:42,540
Because the guy in there said
that he's not in Celebici,

552
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,309
which means maybe
he actually is in Celebici.

553
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,479
Right.
Unless he's really not in Celebici.

554
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,890
Well, that's a possibility, too.

555
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,626
- Jeez!
- Holy shit!

556
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,636
Get down!

557
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:07,306
Hold on.

558
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,780
What in the fuck was that about, man?

559
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,622
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

560
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,817
We're going to die.

561
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,819
Every single person out here
knows exactly what we're doing.

562
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,955
Keep your panties dry, Benjamin.

563
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,658
- It had nothing to do with the Fox.
- What the hell do you mean?

564
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:37,853
It's just a little local tradition
to shoot at every customer?

565
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,807
Wait a minute.
Is that my money?

566
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,502
You mean the money I left on the table?
That's mine?

567
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,912
- Simon!
- Times are tight.

568
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,273
- Things happen. Sue me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,309
You stole the money
that was left for the bill?

570
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,312
- I needed it more.
- Okay, you got us shot at for 20 bucks.

571
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:56,807
I didn't know he was going
to shoot at us.

572
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,831
Unbelievable!

573
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:09,195
Much gun play when you and Franklin

574
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,898
do your stories about
the president's new tax code?

575
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,832
- Fuck off.
- Come on, Duckie.

576
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,310
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

577
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,694
A little taste of what you left behind?

578
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,782
Don't say you didn't.

579
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:27,016
<i># It's a bad situation
in a beautiful place #</i>

580
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,924
<i># It's a bad situation
in a beautiful place #</i>

581
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:36,864
<i># It's a bad situation #</i>

582
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,841
That pile of rubble used to be a mosque.

583
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:56,676
Now the town's
a hundred percent Bosnian Serb.

584
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,478
No Muslims left.

585
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:01,514
Ethnically cleansed for your protection.

586
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:02,882
Nice vibe, right?

587
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:07,489
There's a reason they say
the river runs red in Foca...

588
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:09,823
and it ain't because of the wine.

589
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,591
What does the Cyrillic say?

590
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,069
It says, "Don't touch him."

591
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,836
- Wait. Where are you going?
- The police.

592
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,973
Need a good laugh.

593
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,449
War criminals?

594
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:29,443
Believe it or not,
we don't even have a copy

595
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,411
of the complete indictment list.

596
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:33,380
- You don't?
- No.

597
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,482
Do you have a copy?
I could always Xerox it.

598
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,859
Miriam, is the copier working again?

599
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:43,991
Word has it there's a bunch of them
living right here in Foca.

600
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,697
Could be.

601
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:49,696
Unfortunately, we're here
to reform the police force,

602
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,298
not hunt for war criminals.

603
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:52,801
But it wouldn't be much hunting.

604
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,370
I mean, most of them are listed
right in the phone book.

605
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,706
As I said, we're not authorized
to arrest war criminals.

606
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:02,709
- You are the international police, right?
- Yes.

607
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,479
Under the flag of the United Nations.

608
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,881
I thought the UN was looking
for war criminals.

609
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,552
We are. Aggressively.

610
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:12,187
There's a $5 million reward, you know?

611
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,988
But you said you don't have
an indictment list.

612
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,589
We don't.

613
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,599
Donut?

614
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,069
Donut.

615
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:23,097
Flown in from Bonn.

616
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,165
Very black market.

617
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:29,700
I particularly like the chocolate ones
with the rainbow sprinkles.

618
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:33,175
You see, it's the UN that are looking
for war criminals,

619
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:35,343
not the UN police task force.

620
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,079
No, not the ones
who could actually catch them.

621
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,849
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

622
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,118
Sounds like the usual UN jerk-off to me.

623
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:45,128
You got any milk?

624
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,423
Look, we're headed up to Celibici now.

625
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,458
We just figured we'd stop in
and register with you

626
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,229
just in case we got killed
or something like that.

627
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,664
Well, consider yourselves registered.

628
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:59,269
Miriam, uh, be a love and get me a tea.

629
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:01,102
Four sugars.

630
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,308
Oh, and a glass of milk.

631
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,208
Is there any word

632
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:08,577
on what's going up there now?

633
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,986
Well, something.

634
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:15,901
It's third time this year
we've been ordered to stay away.

635
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,987
From Celibici?

636
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:20,356
Suspicious, no?

637
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:22,292
Yeah.

638
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:24,462
Who ordered you?

639
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,061
UN command.

640
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:29,165
Told us to stay away
for four or five days.

641
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,900
Jesus fucking Christ.

642
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,536
They tell the police
not to go up to Celebici.

643
00:36:33,546 --> 00:36:35,671
I mean, he's actually up there.
I can't fucking believe this.

644
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,673
Why would they tell them
not to go up there?

645
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:39,109
Tell them not to go up there

646
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,377
because I don't want them
walking into a shootout.

647
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,947
Now, really...

648
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:46,024
tell me the truth.

649
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,551
Who the fuck are you guys?

650
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,189
I told you, we are journalists.

651
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,355
Journalists?

652
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,225
Yeah. You have our press credentials.

653
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,235
Yes.

654
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,264
Very professionally done.

655
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,902
So, uh, you are journalists who believe

656
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:09,506
that they can get close to someone
that no one else can.

657
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:13,111
Yeah. What's the problem?

658
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,578
I understand.

659
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:15,645
I understand.

660
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:18,290
You are journalists on a story.

661
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:24,106
What, you think we're just posing
as journalists?

662
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:30,393
Do you like beer?
I like beer. Do you like beer?

663
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:32,403
Let's get a beer.

664
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,504
For a group of UN guards to go,
it's too dangerous.

665
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:42,914
For you guys? Sure, why not?

666
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,442
Go to Celibici.

667
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:46,110
Do the world a favor.

668
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,113
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
we're a CIA hit squad or something?

669
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:54,218
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
you're journalists?

670
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,753
Look, um...

671
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,493
I know things.

672
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,195
I know how things operate.

673
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,480
I've been waiting for you.

674
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,667
Certain things need to be taken
care of professionally, right?

675
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,802
- Took me months...
- Shh.

676
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:16,774
Took me months to gain the trust
of certain people

677
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:19,111
who normally would be protecting
the Fox.

678
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:21,214
That's how I know you
didn't just stumble on...

679
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:22,513
the fact he's up in Celibici.

680
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:24,849
Well, it's been printed in the press.

681
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,429
So has the horoscopes.
Do you believe them?

682
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,956
- You're not making any sense now.
- I know.

683
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,160
I'm the United Nations.

684
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:45,304
And fact is, the United Nations...

685
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:47,605
Oh, fuck.
The French specifically,

686
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:49,708
they have no interest
in catching the Fox.

687
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,910
They would be happy
if he killed all the Muslims.

688
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,379
Save them all this money and energy.

689
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,681
John Major and the British
backed the Fox,

690
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:59,418
even though they would never
publicly admit it.

691
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,087
And the Americans...
Yeah, they brokered the peace agreement,

692
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:04,956
but some would suggest
they made a secret deal with the Fox

693
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,925
that if he stepped down from power,

694
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:10,420
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

695
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:14,466
Who knows what's true, what isn't?
The whole fucking thing is dirty.

696
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:17,206
But in dirty times...

697
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,255
dirty deeds need to be done, right?

698
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:24,743
One arm of the government said
it would do something, does nothing.

699
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,012
That would be us.

700
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,446
The other hand...

701
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,823
CIA...

702
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,718
whoever...

703
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,728
does something else.

704
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:35,421
I mean, look at you guys.

705
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:39,001
Do you really think you're fooling anyone?

706
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:44,030
He thinks we're a hit squad.

707
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,833
- He thinks we're a fucking hit squad!
- Yeah, this can't be good.

708
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,702
Isn't it illegal,
impersonating a CIA officer?

709
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,070
Yeah, but we denied it.

710
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,205
Yeah, he didn't believe it.

711
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:55,074
It's true.
It's like the more we fucking denied it,

712
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,576
the more he didn't believe it.

713
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:59,412
Yeah, the problem is,
if you were CIA you would deny it.

714
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,382
And if you weren't,
you would also deny it.

715
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,284
Actually he's not that far
off the mark, you know?

716
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:05,619
I mean, we're not CIA,

717
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:07,587
but we can do a lot more

718
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,227
than just interview the Fox.

719
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,959
Wait. Hold up.

720
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,598
- Simon.
- What?

721
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,832
Now, you're not still
on this capturing jag?

722
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:21,276
It's not a jag.

723
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:24,507
Not a jag, not a whim.
Especially now.

724
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,840
Especially since Boris basically confirmed
that he's hiding out up there.

725
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,175
Okay. Now, now, Simon,

726
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,345
I was willing to come along with you

727
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:34,381
and try to even get close enough
to this psychopathic fuck

728
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,326
to try and get an interview.

729
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,620
But we are not capturing him.

730
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,287
I mean, look at us.

731
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:44,095
That's not what we do.

732
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm checking into that hotel

733
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,628
down the road.

734
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:50,364
I'm taking a shower,
a shit, and a Seconal.

735
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:51,665
Tomorrow morning I'm getting up,

736
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,400
I'm driving up that mountain to Celibici,

737
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,537
and I am finding the Fox.

738
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,571
Now, you're welcome to join me, Duckie,

739
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,706
or you're welcome to fuck off.

740
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:01,716
Your choice.

741
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,635
You think this is crazy too, huh?

742
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,091
I mean, just trying
to get an interview is crazy.

743
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,899
But we're not mercenaries.

744
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,664
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be
on fucking vacation.

745
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:25,733
And it makes sense why he had
a meltdown on air.

746
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:27,743
He's a goddamn nut job.

747
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,972
Yeah, Simon is a goddamn nut job,

748
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,247
but his meltdown wasn't for nothing.

749
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,011
We'd seen some horrible stuff that day.

750
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:41,101
Yeah, reporters see horrible things
all the time.

751
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:43,226
That's what they do.

752
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,589
Yeah.

753
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,725
Look, I saw the tape, okay?
He was drunk, high.

754
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,695
He just fucking lost it.

755
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:56,020
He lost it then,
and he's losing it now.

756
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,514
There was these two girls, right?

757
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,881
Named Marda and Una.

758
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,887
They said they were cousins but...

759
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:13,649
We used to hang out together
from time to time.

760
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,951
Who the hell knows why they were there.

761
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,319
It was war.

762
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,329
People was broke.

763
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:21,832
People did things.

764
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:24,096
All I know is...

765
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,169
we had a good time.

766
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:28,205
They were our friends.

767
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,234
Somewhere along the line,

768
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,371
maybe the second
or third year into the war,

769
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:38,781
Simon and Marda,
they had a little thing.

770
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:44,513
Hell, it was more than a little thing.

771
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:48,050
Simon, he liked her.

772
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,491
He did things for her.

773
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:54,857
Whatever little money he had, he gave her.

774
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,493
They didn't spend that much time together.

775
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,165
But it was war, how can you?

776
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:03,972
But Simon,
in his own little crazy way,

777
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:06,043
he loved her.

778
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:12,047
Now, you fast-forward six months.

779
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:15,312
Sarajevo's under siege worse than ever.

780
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:19,215
And we haven't heard from Marda
or her cousin for months now.

781
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:20,984
And only thing we knew

782
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,186
was that Marda had gone back to Polje

783
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:25,196
to help out her mother.

784
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:30,861
And then one day we hear
about a serious incident in Polje,

785
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:33,250
and we go there to cover it.

786
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:39,111
The horrors we saw.

787
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,179
Fucking inhuman.

788
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:45,576
Neither Simon nor I said anything,

789
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:47,344
you know, although we both knew

790
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,814
that Marda was from this town.

791
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,587
We just got ready to do our job,

792
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
cover our story.

793
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,922
Inez,

794
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,996
Jasmine,

795
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,259
Amar,

796
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:03,961
Amin.

797
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:05,029
No?

798
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,831
How about Aidan?

799
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:10,641
Or how about Simon Junior?

800
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:16,543
And then there she was.

801
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:20,017
Twenty minutes before
we went on the air.

802
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:25,722
They had shot her in
her stomach five times.

803
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:32,124
So don't believe everything
that you learn in journalism school,

804
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:35,934
'cause in war...

805
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,929
what you see

806
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,230
and what really happened

807
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,640
are sometimes two very different things.

808
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,515
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

809
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:13,694
Simon!

810
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,001
Simon, no! No! No!

811
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,631
Okay? Okay? Come on.

812
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,399
- It's all right.
- You okay?

813
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,243
Wait! Simon, no! Wait!

814
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:25,862
- Let go!
- No! Simon! Come on!

815
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,875
You fucking shit!

816
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:31,320
No! No! No!

817
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,821
No! Please, Simon.

818
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,348
Please.

819
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,358
It's okay.

820
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:50,938
Fuck.

821
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,101
Oh, fuck, man.

822
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,111
I know.

823
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,016
Watch the land mines.

824
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,026
Okay, shut up.

825
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:14,191
You see that?

826
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,752
What was that? A lookout?

827
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,688
My God, Duck.
I think he's really up there.

828
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:24,203
They're watching every car
that goes up this mountain.

829
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,109
Hold on, boys.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

830
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:43,012
Wait, hold on.

831
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:45,022
Wait, wait, wait.

832
00:48:45,157 --> 00:48:47,622
Back, back, back, back, back.

833
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:50,119
You are out of your mind.

834
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:52,129
Correct.

835
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:55,714
Where's the welcoming committee?

836
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:59,724
Be thankful that there aren't
50 Kalashnikovs pointed at our heads.

837
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,224
So what are you going to do?

838
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,195
I'm going to do what
any good journalist would do

839
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,963
when he gets to a new place.

840
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:08,134
Yeah? What's that?

841
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,249
I'm going to find a bar.

842
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:55,647
Doesn't exactly look like they get
many newcomers in here.

843
00:50:55,657 --> 00:50:58,547
Just keep smiling. You'll be fine.

844
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,958
What did he say?

845
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:10,228
He said you're about skinny enough
to be used as bait.

846
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:14,403
- Yeah. It's a fishing joke.
- Yeah, no. I get it.

847
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,871
Duck, I hope you have money.

848
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:23,621
What happened to the 20
I gave you yesterday?

849
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:33,433
Simon, save some for me.

850
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:00,312
What is he saying?

851
00:52:00,388 --> 00:52:02,823
He just sold you and me out.

852
00:52:02,892 --> 00:52:04,550
- Thank you, Simon.
- Great.

853
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
You're welcome.

854
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:26,806
Do you really think we would
sell out leader of our people

855
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:29,409
for a simple glass of cheap brandy?

856
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:34,859
Do you really think the people
of Republica Srpska are that weak?

857
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:37,984
We don't go University like you people do.

858
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:42,754
But we are not dumb,
and we don't like to be made fun of.

859
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:44,424
We are not making fun of you.

860
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:46,726
Bullshit! You continue even now.

861
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:49,796
Don't insult me by acting otherwise.

862
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:52,865
Okay, we don't want any trouble.

863
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:56,275
You know how I got
these animals on wall?

864
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:01,049
- I shoot them.
- All right.

865
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:03,143
We're going to be leaving now.

866
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:05,153
Yes, I think so.

867
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,348
- One question before we go.
- Simon...

868
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:11,163
Did you ever go hunting with him?

869
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:25,867
I mean, uh, he got his nickname
because he loved to hunt foxes.

870
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:27,668
You obviously love to hunt foxes.

871
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:29,678
I was just wondering.

872
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,507
In a war, I kill people like you.

873
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,645
The war is over.

874
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,418
Yes, yes, it is.

875
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:44,393
Wait.

876
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,488
Did you hunt with him?

877
00:53:47,498 --> 00:53:52,428
- For fuck's sake, Simon.
- You are one brave motherfucker.

878
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,529
Hey. Duck.

879
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:55,997
Duck, look.

880
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:59,434
You're just like those stupid
United Nations people

881
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,937
that poke around,
seeing if one of us will talk.

882
00:54:02,947 --> 00:54:06,441
You tell your friends
that we know nothing here.

883
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,244
Tell them that we lost loved ones
in the war, too.

884
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:10,511
Not just the Muslims.

885
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:12,380
You tell them that.

886
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,810
I make sure you get back down the road
without dying.

887
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:20,523
Or at least I do my best.

888
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,725
What do you mean, you saw his cars?

889
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:25,960
While you were back there
being a complete fucking asshole,

890
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,162
Benjamin saw them out the door.

891
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:29,565
Jesus. Which way did they go?

892
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:31,133
- Back down the mountain.
- Go!

893
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,634
Get in the car!

894
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,644
Shit! Fuck!

895
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:44,213
What are we going to do,
run 'em off the road?

896
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,182
- I don't know.
- These men are killers, Simon!

897
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:49,251
- Fuck these roads!
- Simon.

898
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,153
Kid's got a point.

899
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,521
So does my dick.

900
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:54,690
What exactly are you planning on doing?

901
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,425
You got three cars that's full of them!

902
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,994
Yeah, I'm going to call
the UN or NATO or someone.

903
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,097
- No fucking calls.
- What the hell?

904
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,065
- You madman! That was my phone!
- No calls!

905
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:05,115
No NATO! No UN! Nothing!

906
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:06,935
I don't trust anybody!

907
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:09,004
- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

908
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:22,123
Simon, I swear to God, if you do
something stupid, I'll kill you myself.

909
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:26,488
- Hi.
- Hi. Get out of the car.

910
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,658
No, we're just tourists
on our way to Montenegro.

911
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:30,560
Yeah, get out of the fucking car now!

912
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,228
Oh, my God.
We're going to fucking die.

913
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:33,862
- Stay calm.
- Out!

914
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,765
You're making a mistake here
because we're just passing...

915
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:38,775
On the ground!

916
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:41,071
- Get the fuck on the ground!
- Just don't panic.

917
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:43,139
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you waiting for? Come on.

918
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:45,841
- No, nothing. Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

919
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:48,578
Out. Out. You, too. Out.
Come on. Come on.

920
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:50,980
- This was all a misunderstanding.
- Shut the fuck up!

921
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,720
On the ground now! Get down.

922
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:57,108
- On the ground now.
- Okay, okay, okay.

923
00:55:57,864 --> 00:55:59,756
You don't have to worry about us.
We're just journalists!

924
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:02,316
- You do not have...
- Shut up!

925
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:10,242
Simon?

926
00:56:15,448 --> 00:56:17,040
Goran? Fucking hell!

927
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,644
Shit. Fucking Simon Hunt!

928
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,311
You know this motherfucker?

929
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:23,813
Sascha!
Simon Hunt!

930
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:30,127
Goran, you crazy, thick-necked
Croatian son of a bitch!

931
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:33,290
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

932
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,192
- We almost kill you, man.
- Yeah, no shit.

933
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,228
Listen, never drive on our road.

934
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:39,830
But if you do, call first us, okay?

935
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,070
Okay. All right. I promise. I promise.

936
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:46,637
Laugh at all their jokes.

937
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,539
Whatever you do, don't stare at the midget.

938
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,707
What midget?

939
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:51,542
They're black marketeers.

940
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:53,902
- They run stuff that
comes in through Croatia.

941
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:54,912
Okay.

942
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:57,186
- Simon!
- Sascha!

943
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:01,594
- Oh, shit, I'm staring at the midget.
- Well, stop.

944
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:09,199
Where the fuck my money?

945
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,500
Beautiful guitar, it's yours.
Go ahead.

946
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,369
Un-fucking-believable.

947
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:19,249
Yeah, it's, like, twice his size.

948
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:23,346
Fucking greedy midget.

949
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,720
What?

950
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:30,415
I'll pay you back.

951
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,425
I'll pay you both back.

952
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,765
<i>- Duck?
- Hey, baby.</i>

953
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:48,267
Wait, I can hardly hear you.

954
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:51,236
Costas, can you turn down
the stereo, please?

955
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:53,438
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

956
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:56,083
No. Baby, I said where are you?

957
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:59,918
<i>Oh, oh, yeah. I'm on Gaspar's boat.</i>

958
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,147
Who is Gaspar?

959
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:04,050
Costas and Lola's friend.
No, no more champagne.

960
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,053
No, talk to me!
Who is Costas and Lola?

961
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,856
Look baby, I can hardly hear you.

962
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,156
The connection's horrible.

963
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,390
When are you coming?

964
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,494
<i>I'm going to be there tomorrow morning.</i>

965
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:15,627
First flight out.

966
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,597
<i>Okay. But you better hurry!</i>

967
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:19,499
Georgio, no! I'm ticklish!

968
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,307
Wait a minute! Who is Georgio?

969
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:26,072
<i>- You can't slap my butt like that.
- What? No! Put Georgio on the phone!</i>

970
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,974
<i>I want to talk to Georgio!</i>

971
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:30,214
Hello?

972
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:48,836
Oh, my God.

973
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:58,172
So you ran into the midget.

974
00:58:58,182 --> 00:59:00,406
It's better than running over the midget.

975
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,808
And how'd you know?

976
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,777
Look. We cannot talk here.

977
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,778
I didn't know we were talking.

978
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,248
We're not talking.

979
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,916
Well, it looks like we're talking.

980
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:13,828
Visegrad. Dobran Tunnel,
tonight at 9.

981
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,897
Things are heating up.

982
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,952
Why do you keep breaking into my room?

983
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,187
Look, I'm between places right now.

984
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:48,197
I needed a bath.

985
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:04,985
So what the hell are
you going to do, Simon?

986
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:07,108
You're broke.

987
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:09,118
You owe midgets.

988
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,782
I dream about him, Duck.

989
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:17,087
I dream about catching him.

990
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:23,965
Wiping that arrogant smile off his face.

991
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:26,394
My whole fucking situation,

992
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:32,099
every bad thing that's ever happened
to me, stems from that bastard.

993
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:35,667
I was flying high before that war.

994
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:38,681
I know.

995
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,111
We were a fucking great team.

996
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,248
The best.

997
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,967
And then it all went to shit.

998
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:04,516
Finding him would've been
so fucking brilliant.

999
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:10,741
Maybe you should call your source again.

1000
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,254
What?

1001
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,182
What?

1002
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:21,784
There is no source.

1003
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,558
I made up the whole story.

1004
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,955
You are un-fucking-believable.

1005
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,425
I heard rumors that
the Fox was up in Celebici.

1006
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:33,363
I thought if I had a source,
it'd push you over to joining me, so...

1007
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:36,166
You know, I must be a fucking idiot.

1008
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:37,900
No, I'm an asshole.

1009
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,071
No, all this time, you've been
making fun of my life in New York.

1010
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:44,340
Joking about how
I'm not the man that I used to be?

1011
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,210
Let me share something with you, Simon.
You're not the man you used to be, either.

1012
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,600
You are far fucking from it.

1013
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:57,139
Dry your dick off
and get the fuck outta my room.

1014
01:01:57,864 --> 01:01:59,222
Lady, do you...

1015
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:02,377
Look, I'm just trying to change my...

1016
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,773
Hello? Hello?

1017
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:11,844
Yes, I made it up.

1018
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,538
- Shit, Simon.
- We weren't wrong, you know?

1019
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:16,806
Boris, the UN guy, he thought
we were right on his trail.

1020
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,076
- Yeah, well, he still does.
- What do you mean?

1021
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:21,678
I just saw him in the lobby,

1022
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:24,914
and he wants to meet
his favorite CIA hit squad

1023
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,117
at that burnt-out tunnel
in Visegrad tonight.

1024
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,787
- He said, "Things are heating up."
- He did?

1025
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:32,055
Yes. The whole damn thing
is fucking ridiculous.

1026
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:36,485
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
We got to get going!

1027
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:52,456
So at what point do we get
jumped and killed?

1028
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:14,031
I'm not doing what I'm doing.

1029
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,301
I mean, clearly I'm doing this,
but I'm not doing this,

1030
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:21,372
because if I was doing this, I could
get into a lot of trouble for doing it.

1031
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,707
What the fuck, Boris?

1032
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:24,717
Yeah.

1033
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:33,752
She might seem
young and beautiful to you,

1034
01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:36,721
but she would cut your balls off
and sell them as trinkets

1035
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:40,386
if she thinks you're fucking
with her. Okay?

1036
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:42,702
Boris?

1037
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,931
Who are you talking about?

1038
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,901
The person I spoke to about your mission.

1039
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,069
Mirjana.

1040
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:54,378
She is going to lead you to the Fox.

1041
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,450
Come.

1042
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,850
Sit down.

1043
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:41,762
Sit.

1044
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:58,913
I'm no friend of the Muslims.

1045
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:02,108
Right at the start of the war,
they got some girls from my school.

1046
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:05,433
Look, it was shitty on all sides, okay?

1047
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:11,632
You don't know shitty until you've been
gang-raped for seven hours.

1048
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:19,827
- Where's Boris?
- This is not about justice.

1049
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:22,429
I am and always will be a proud Serb.

1050
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:23,864
This is about money.

1051
01:05:23,874 --> 01:05:27,969
My father had a system.
Made us money.

1052
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:30,470
Then Boghanovic's men took over.

1053
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,480
Wanted what we had.

1054
01:05:33,617 --> 01:05:37,277
Now they run the petrol and cigarettes
coming in from Serbia.

1055
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:40,654
Use that money to protect him.

1056
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:44,717
But they killed my father.

1057
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:46,835
And now we have nothing.

1058
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,725
I hate nothing.

1059
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:53,694
You stop them,
I get my family business back.

1060
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,429
What do we get?

1061
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:58,534
What you came to Bosnia to get.

1062
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:05,005
And how do we do that?

1063
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:09,315
My old boyfriend, he is one of his guards.

1064
01:06:09,387 --> 01:06:11,446
Midac.

1065
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:15,088
He is in love with me, calls me every day.

1066
01:06:15,098 --> 01:06:18,286
I have no interest in him anymore,
but I still talk to him

1067
01:06:18,296 --> 01:06:22,631
because I know one day
the CIA will come to my home.

1068
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:27,200
- How many guards?
- Ten.

1069
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,666
- We're just three.
- Three of you is thirty of them.

1070
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:35,636
They are fat and lazy and bored
out of their minds in the countryside.

1071
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:37,638
And you know exactly where he is?

1072
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:40,709
I can.

1073
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:43,516
Now you give me thousand marks.

1074
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:46,948
A thou... Are you out or your fucking mind?

1075
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,850
No. I want goodwill gesture.

1076
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,750
My goodwill has disappeared, lady.

1077
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,595
I risk everything talking to you.

1078
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,760
We just can't.

1079
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:02,766
I need assurance
you don't take advantage of me.

1080
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:12,162
If you guys are not serious, forget it.

1081
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:18,835
The Agency has strict rules.

1082
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:22,782
We're not authorized for payments.

1083
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:29,695
Others in the company are, but not us.

1084
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:33,050
Weaker divisions are.
Smaller divisions.

1085
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:35,368
You know what we do.

1086
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,535
You know who we are.

1087
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:43,672
You know our reputations and our accuracy
in achieving our goals around the world.

1088
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:46,709
A single bullet from us can end wars...

1089
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,110
or start them.

1090
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,746
Now, you're worried
about others killing you,

1091
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:52,915
but what you should most be worried about
are the three people in this room

1092
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,950
and the reputations
that they bring with them.

1093
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,487
We will do what we need to do
to achieve our goals.

1094
01:07:57,497 --> 01:08:00,290
Right now, you're standing in the way
of us achieving those goals.

1095
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,527
You can help us, and you'll no longer
be hindering our operation.

1096
01:08:04,537 --> 01:08:09,042
You can ignore us,
and I cannot guarantee your safety.

1097
01:08:10,642 --> 01:08:16,847
The Agency is, I'm afraid to say,
completely humorless about these issues.

1098
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:30,261
Okay.

1099
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:38,072
Tomorrow, when he call, I will find out
what we all need to know.

1100
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,630
Good.

1101
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,532
Un-fucking-believable, Benji!

1102
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,801
I didn't think you had it in you!

1103
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:47,705
That's the ballsiest fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1104
01:08:47,715 --> 01:08:49,373
You're a madman.

1105
01:08:49,383 --> 01:08:51,842
I think she's just full of shit
and trying to play us,

1106
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:53,576
but it's better to find out for sure.

1107
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:55,712
I don't know what we got
into here, gentlemen,

1108
01:08:55,722 --> 01:08:57,722
but I fucking love it.

1109
01:08:58,826 --> 01:09:02,786
You know, when you think about it,
the whole thing is fucking ridiculous.

1110
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:04,121
Why?

1111
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:06,123
I could very well be CIA.

1112
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:07,791
You can't even spell CIA.

1113
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:11,529
Every fucking CIA guy I know
looks exactly like me.

1114
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:13,330
Yeah, only better-looking.

1115
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,332
They certainly do not look like me.

1116
01:09:15,342 --> 01:09:17,168
And that is the genius of it.

1117
01:09:17,178 --> 01:09:20,070
The CIA would have someone
who doesn't look CIA.

1118
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
That's...

1119
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,676
That's exactly what they would do.

1120
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:30,281
- What?
- I think we're being followed.

1121
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,590
- What?
- What do you mean?

1122
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:38,186
What part of "I think we're being followed"
do you not understand?

1123
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:42,535
Jesus Christ.

1124
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,531
He's right with me every turn.

1125
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:48,541
Who could it be?

1126
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:55,340
- Jesus fucking hell!
- We can't stop.

1127
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,008
We got to get back to Sarajevo.

1128
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:58,276
Yeah, no shit.

1129
01:09:58,286 --> 01:09:59,610
We got one problem.

1130
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,379
That right turn I made back there?

1131
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:03,148
We're not heading toward Sarajevo.

1132
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,717
- We're heading toward Pale.
- Oh, God damn it!

1133
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:07,723
Why? What's Pale?

1134
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,187
Just the worst place we possibly could go.

1135
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:11,056
It's where the Fox lived during the war.

1136
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:14,493
- It's just Serb country.
- Fucking peachy.

1137
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,994
- Fucking hell!
- Jesus!

1138
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:18,463
What's your fucking problem!

1139
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:21,306
- Shit!
- Okay, okay.

1140
01:10:21,376 --> 01:10:23,376
Fucking shit!

1141
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:26,478
Speed up! Speed up! Speed up!

1142
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,588
Hold tight! Hold on!

1143
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:55,412
How come every time I'm with you, Simon,
I put my life in danger?

1144
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:58,979
Because, my old friend,

1145
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:03,576
putting your life in danger
is actual living.

1146
01:11:03,653 --> 01:11:05,814
The rest is television.

1147
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:08,778
You need me to remind you of that.

1148
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:19,860
We got to be extra careful.

1149
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,561
Don't talk to anyone in the hotel.

1150
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,131
- Don't talk on a cell phone.
- That won't be a problem.

1151
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:26,133
Trust me, guys, trust me.

1152
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:28,534
We have stepped into something here.

1153
01:11:28,544 --> 01:11:31,859
People are worried.
People are watching.

1154
01:11:32,448 --> 01:11:35,609
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck is that guy listening to us?

1155
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:36,810
Nobody's listening to us!

1156
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:40,547
What, we got to be afraid
of the hotel help now?

1157
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:42,557
Trust nobody.

1158
01:11:46,763 --> 01:11:49,908
The only person I don't trust is you.

1159
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,268
Are you sleeping in my room?

1160
01:12:01,278 --> 01:12:04,111
- Yes.
- Well, you kids have fun.

1161
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,639
Look, Simon.

1162
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:08,164
I mean, I would be lying
if I wasn't secretly...

1163
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:09,744
hoping all this stuff is true.

1164
01:12:09,754 --> 01:12:12,913
But we're no closer to finding
the Fox than anybody else.

1165
01:12:12,923 --> 01:12:14,923
I mean, Boris is a nut.

1166
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,883
Mirjana's a con artist.

1167
01:12:16,893 --> 01:12:19,319
And that guy following us on the road
is just some drunk

1168
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:23,324
or your little midget friend
wanting to wrestle.

1169
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:26,102
You were saying?

1170
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:30,664
We got to get outta here.

1171
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:40,441
- Fucking don't move.
- Okay, okay, okay!

1172
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:42,851
You wanted to find Fox?

1173
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,555
Well, now Fox want to find you.

1174
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:21,978
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're saying, okay?

1175
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:25,648
I'm sorry, I don't understand!
I don't speak your language!

1176
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:29,819
I don't know what you're saying!
I don't know what you're saying!

1177
01:14:29,829 --> 01:14:31,921
Duck! Duck!
I don't know what he's saying!

1178
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:34,481
I don't know what he's saying!

1179
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:37,660
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1180
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,670
We are not CIA.

1181
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:46,469
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're saying.

1182
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:48,104
We are not CIA!
We are journalists!

1183
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:50,173
No, we are journalists!

1184
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,643
Duck! Duck, what is he saying?

1185
01:14:52,653 --> 01:14:55,112
I don't understand what you're saying!
We are not CIA!

1186
01:14:55,122 --> 01:14:58,314
Don't! Stop it! Stop it!
I don't know what you're saying!

1187
01:14:58,324 --> 01:15:00,451
Stop it! Stop it!

1188
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,802
The truth emerges.

1189
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:00,946
There's been a giant mix-up here.

1190
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,747
What mix-up?

1191
01:16:02,757 --> 01:16:05,247
We know everything.

1192
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,852
Especially when CIA is here.

1193
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:09,253
No, we're not CIA.

1194
01:16:09,263 --> 01:16:11,558
We're really not C... Fuck!

1195
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:25,162
For weeks we've been hearing rumors
that CIA is here.

1196
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:30,809
The CIA is coming for me.

1197
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,143
We hear everything.

1198
01:16:32,153 --> 01:16:34,714
We know everything.

1199
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,648
This is the thing. We're not CIA.

1200
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,718
We're just journalists.

1201
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:40,118
Just journalists. We just came...

1202
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,622
We were trying to get
an interview with you.

1203
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:45,624
But you tell others that you are CIA.

1204
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:48,960
No! No, no, we didn't.
We didn't say anything...

1205
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,970
You said to Boris.

1206
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,233
No. We didn't. We didn't say that.

1207
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,269
He was just really confused.

1208
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,705
We're really just journalists.

1209
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,809
And we're not here to hurt you.

1210
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:14,063
Srdjan.

1211
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:29,844
No, no, no!

1212
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,810
Oh, no, please don't do it!

1213
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:34,883
You can't do it.

1214
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,943
<i># You #</i>

1215
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:42,924
<i># You make me feel brand-new #</i>

1216
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:46,986
- Hello?
- You got to be fucking kidding me.

1217
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,181
Fox!

1218
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:16,650
Fox went out the back!
He's out the back!

1219
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,286
Move in!

1220
01:18:18,296 --> 01:18:20,296
Guys, move it!

1221
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:50,010
<i>Extraction team 107,
this is Firebase Lima. Stand by.</i>

1222
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:57,658
Look, this is a news event.

1223
01:18:57,668 --> 01:18:59,026
We are newsmen.

1224
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:01,331
We want off the copter now.

1225
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:07,751
- You ever heard of freedom of the press?
- Not in Bosnia, sir, no.

1226
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,335
All right. Jazzy, let's start this bird up.

1227
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:18,678
Wait. Where are we going, exactly?

1228
01:19:27,498 --> 01:19:30,388
Hey, excuse me. Did you catch him?

1229
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:34,419
That's classified information.

1230
01:19:36,775 --> 01:19:38,167
Classified.

1231
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:40,177
Correct. Classified.

1232
01:19:40,212 --> 01:19:43,442
So you're saying you didn't catch him?

1233
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:46,511
He was right fucking there!

1234
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:48,844
Just what are you insinuating?

1235
01:19:48,854 --> 01:19:51,079
I was an inch... an inch from this guy!

1236
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:52,214
He was there!

1237
01:19:52,224 --> 01:19:55,051
We saved your life.
That was our mission.

1238
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,152
You cut it pretty close, don't you think?

1239
01:19:57,162 --> 01:20:01,156
We did our job. Now you guys
got to get the hell out of this country.

1240
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:05,260
No. No, I think there's a pretty good story
to tell inside this country.

1241
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:10,455
I was nose-to-nose with the most wanted
fugitive in the world.

1242
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:16,005
Let me tell you something, Mr. Cunt.

1243
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,778
- Hunt.
- Mr. Hunt.

1244
01:20:18,851 --> 01:20:21,511
You're lucky I haven't already
arrested your sorry ass

1245
01:20:21,521 --> 01:20:25,013
and thrown you in a dark fucking hole
with no fucking exits.

1246
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:26,582
Arrested for what?

1247
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,452
Impersonating a CIA officer
is a serious offense.

1248
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:33,899
Jesus fuck.
We never impersonated anyone.

1249
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:39,028
Your friend Boris is on a plane for Uganda
where he will now be stationed.

1250
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:41,698
But before he was suddenly
transferred to darkest Africa

1251
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,466
to never be heard from again,

1252
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:47,726
we confronted him
about your little representation.

1253
01:20:49,415 --> 01:20:51,307
If I ever hear from you again,

1254
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:55,311
the CIA will be on you like a cheap suit
from the Men's Wearhouse.

1255
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,881
You'll be arrested, jailed,

1256
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:01,986
and sodomized by a big, dumb,
large-cocked Serbian bastard

1257
01:21:01,996 --> 01:21:04,521
for the rest of your shitty little lives.

1258
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,992
And if you don't care about that,
if you like big Serbian cock,

1259
01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:10,261
and you still plan
on reporting any of this,

1260
01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:12,896
then your friend Boris
will find himself eaten

1261
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:16,603
by a tiger or lion or a squirrel

1262
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:20,237
or whatever fucking animal
we can find in darkest Africa.

1263
01:21:20,247 --> 01:21:22,106
And you'll have to live with that.

1264
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:26,536
I assume that I can quote you
on the squirrel remark.

1265
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,455
Look, Cunt.

1266
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:33,884
The CIA has a bright side,
the CIA has a dark side,

1267
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:36,120
and then there's the gray side.

1268
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,956
We do the things that people
don't need to know about.

1269
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:41,392
It's a part we deny even exists.

1270
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:44,051
It's a part of the CIA
that's been working for...

1271
01:21:44,061 --> 01:21:46,330
the last three weeks in Bosnia on the Fox.

1272
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,968
And what have you been working on doing,
letting him disappear?

1273
01:21:49,978 --> 01:21:51,936
Let me ask you a question.

1274
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:55,472
Why do you think the CIA
would want to let a war criminal go?

1275
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:57,242
Let me ask you a question.

1276
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:59,981
In five years, why has the CIA,

1277
01:22:00,055 --> 01:22:03,957
the Hague, the United Nations, and NATO

1278
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:08,252
not been able to find a guy
that we found in just two days

1279
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:11,255
if you actually wanted to find him?

1280
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:23,468
We're giving you a one-way ticket home.

1281
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:25,003
I suggest you use it.

1282
01:22:25,013 --> 01:22:27,903
We're not saving your asses again.

1283
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:32,909
From this moment on,
the story's being written by others.

1284
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:01,306
The Americans, yeah,
they brokered the peace agreement,

1285
01:23:01,316 --> 01:23:04,542
but some would suggest they
made a secret deal with the Fox,

1286
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:10,927
that if he stepped down from power
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

1287
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:27,833
You ever flown in
one of these puppies before?

1288
01:23:27,843 --> 01:23:30,469
You won't have feeling
in your ass for a week.

1289
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,794
- Great.
- It's nice they packed for us.

1290
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:35,809
So what are you going to do?

1291
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,050
I don't know.
Go to Greece with Duck.

1292
01:23:39,121 --> 01:23:43,116
Share some moussaka
with him and his girlfriend.

1293
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:46,794
Duck?

1294
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:50,089
Duck?

1295
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:52,099
What is it?

1296
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,999
They sent Boris out of this country

1297
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:03,139
because he was actually
trying to catch the Fox.

1298
01:24:03,213 --> 01:24:05,605
They're sending us away
because we found him.

1299
01:24:05,615 --> 01:24:07,974
No, he found us.
We're lucky we still have our heads.

1300
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:11,344
No, it's like no one in a position
of power in this place

1301
01:24:11,354 --> 01:24:13,980
even wants to try and catch that bastard.

1302
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,348
And that's just wrong.

1303
01:24:15,358 --> 01:24:17,849
Yeah.

1304
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,928
What are you saying?

1305
01:24:20,797 --> 01:24:23,527
I'm saying we can't leave.

1306
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:32,951
I think I just wet myself.

1307
01:24:46,858 --> 01:24:48,783
All right.

1308
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:50,318
Yeah.

1309
01:24:50,328 --> 01:24:52,220
Yeah, let's go get this bastard.

1310
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:56,394
<i>Okay, gentlemen, load 'em up.
We're ready to go.</i>

1311
01:24:58,235 --> 01:24:59,861
<i>Prepare plane for taxi.</i>

1312
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:02,863
All right, um, what's the plan?

1313
01:25:04,876 --> 01:25:06,876
Run.

1314
01:25:08,045 --> 01:25:09,904
Run? That's your plan?

1315
01:25:09,914 --> 01:25:11,914
Yeah. Run.

1316
01:25:24,195 --> 01:25:25,753
<i>As a kid I never dreamed</i>

1317
01:25:25,763 --> 01:25:28,755
<i>about being an action hero.</i>

1318
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:34,204
<i>But, as Boris said, in dirty times,
dirty deeds need to be done.</i>

1319
01:25:36,408 --> 01:25:41,107
<i>The rest of the story,
I guess, is urban legend.</i>

1320
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:46,550
<i>I'd tell you it was true,
but you'd never believe me anyway.</i>

1321
01:25:47,853 --> 01:25:52,586
<i>Mirjana did find out
where the Fox was hiding,</i>

1322
01:25:52,658 --> 01:25:57,252
<i>and that gave us the idea of how
the three of us could catch him.</i>

1323
01:25:57,262 --> 01:26:01,425
<i>You see, you can't go hunting
with ten bodyguards.</i>

1324
01:26:01,435 --> 01:26:03,025
<i>It's too noisy.</i>

1325
01:26:03,035 --> 01:26:05,663
<i>It scares off the animals.</i>

1326
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:46,376
Doctor?

1327
01:27:58,652 --> 01:28:01,986
Where is the rest of your team?

1328
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:06,217
There ain't no team, you motherfucker.

1329
01:28:06,227 --> 01:28:08,227
It's just us.

1330
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,328
I get you $5 million.

1331
01:28:16,404 --> 01:28:19,339
United States currency.

1332
01:28:19,406 --> 01:28:23,036
Take it. It's yours.

1333
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:26,571
We get $5 million just for turning you in.

1334
01:28:26,581 --> 01:28:29,778
You turn me in, and then what?

1335
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:34,220
They are more afraid of me
than I am of them.

1336
01:28:36,825 --> 01:28:40,591
You do not have the balls to kill me.

1337
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:44,962
And you do not have the balls
to take my money.

1338
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:46,826
And you do not have the balls

1339
01:28:46,836 --> 01:28:49,227
to see what the international community

1340
01:28:49,237 --> 01:28:53,196
will do or not do to me.

1341
01:28:53,274 --> 01:28:56,300
You have nothing.

1342
01:28:58,513 --> 01:29:02,244
That's why we've got to change the rules.

1343
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:31,904
If the power comes back on,
it still doesn't mean you can leave.

1344
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:33,873
I'm never leaving.

1345
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:39,253
I'll have myself surgically
attached to you.

1346
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:56,897
This was Marda's town.

1347
01:29:56,907 --> 01:30:00,902
It's one of the few places
Muslims came back to.

1348
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:06,573
They'll know best what to do with him.

1349
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:28,389
Let me borrow 50 bucks.

1350
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,359
What? We just left $5 million
tied to the side of the road.

1351
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:32,961
You want to borrow 50 bucks?

1352
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:34,962
Actually, make it a hundred.

1353
01:31:34,972 --> 01:31:36,464
You know, when all this hits,

1354
01:31:36,474 --> 01:31:39,634
it's going to be a shit-storm of
international denial and cover-ups.

1355
01:31:39,644 --> 01:31:42,471
Maybe you could talk to your father,
get me that gig to report it.

1356
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:44,238
Then I can pay you back.

1357
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:46,248
All right.

1358
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:53,482
So what are you going to do?

1359
01:31:53,492 --> 01:31:55,350
You going to stay and cover it?

1360
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,286
Are you?

1361
01:31:57,296 --> 01:32:00,493
I got the cushy gig in New York.

1362
01:32:00,566 --> 01:32:02,659
The girl in Greece.

1363
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:04,126
The story...

1364
01:32:04,136 --> 01:32:07,970
The story's going to be right here.

1365
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,868
Just play something
decent on this, will you?

1366
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:14,878
For once?

1367
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:19,107
Simon, you're the only man I know
who would borrow money

1368
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:22,678
to repay a debt that you
took to repay a debt.

1369
01:32:22,688 --> 01:32:26,125
And that's why you love me.

1370
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:30,525
That's why I love you.

1371

<i># I fought the law, and the law won #</i>
