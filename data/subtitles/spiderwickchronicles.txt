1
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
There it is.

2
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Pretty much how I remember it.

3
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,520
I was younger than you
last time I was here, Simon.

4
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,760
Well, it's big.

5
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah, so I can get bigger pets here,
right, Mom?

6
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,600
Sure! Get a cow. Get a whole flock.

7
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
Herd.

8
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
That, too. What do you think, Jared?

9
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
Jared?

10
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
Okay. Here we go.

11
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,480
It's okay, Mr. Tibbs. It's okay.

12
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,320
It has that old people smell.

13
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,920
It's just an observation, not a judgment.

14
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
You're angry about the move. I get that.

15
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,480
Just what are you expecting
your silent protest will get you?

16
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,720
At least acknowledge this isn't
the way to deal with your anger

17
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,200
the way you said you were gonna do.

18
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,880
Say yes with your head.

19
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,280
Two blinks.

20
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
Nothing.

21
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Mal, you and Simon take your stuff.

22
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,320
Wait in the foyer while I go look
for the main circuit breaker.

23
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
Okay, Mom.

24
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,760
- Get out of the car right now.
- You're not my mother, Mallory.

25
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
No, I'm worse,
because Mom doesn't believe in hitting.

26
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,720
- Come here, you little...
- And he's out of the car! Thank you!

27
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,480
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
keep acting like a jerk!

28
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,440
- I'll do whatever I want.
- No, you won't!

29
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760
Mom needs this to work, so cut it out!

30
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
- Simon, get her!
- I'm a pacifist.

31
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,000
You're so annoying.
You think you know everything!

32
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
- Well, I know stuff you don't.
- Like what?

33
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Nothing.

34
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,520
- Thanks for having my back, bro.
- I don't do conflict.

35
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,840
- What are you doing?
- Unpacking.

36
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Why? I told you it was only temporary.

37
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,200
Dad's coming tomorrow,
and he's gonna take us back with him.

38
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,760
- I know. But what about Mom?
- She can have Mallory.

39
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,560
Come on, Simon, we can't stay here.

40
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,800
Look at this place.
It's the house that time forgot.

41
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,720
- And it's got that...
- Old people smell, I know.

42
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,480
And what's this?

43
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
Salt. There's salt on the window.

44
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
I know. It's on all the windows.

45
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, and that's not weird.

46
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm guessing she put it there.

47
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
- Is that the nut bag and her husband?
- No.

48
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,160
That's Arthur Spiderwick,
you know, our great-great-uncle.

49
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,120
The little girl's the nut bag.
I mean, Aunt Lucinda, his daughter.

50
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,680
She's the one who lived here
before they took her away to the...

51
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,800
To the...

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
To the nut house.

53
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320
Right.

54
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,280
And why'd she get taken there?

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
Because she said
her father was abducted.

56
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,960
By?

57
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,440
By faeries.

58
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
Exactly.

59
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,160
Our crazy aunt stayed here
her whole life and never left, ever!

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
That's not gonna happen to me, or you.

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,240
End of discussion.

62
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Has anybody seen my keys?
I know I left them right here.

63
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Nope.

64
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,080
I guess Aunt Lucinda
liked honey with her oatmeal, huh?

65
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,760
And tomato sauce.

66
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,320
Wow.

67
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
Where is my fencing medal, Jared?

68
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,320
- Hanging on your bed?
- It's not there anymore.

69
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
Well, find the bed
and you'll find your medal.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm not talking about the bed...

71
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
You know what?

72
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm not acknowledging your existence
until you bring my medal back.

73
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,800
Promise?

74
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,200
Well, actually, you'd have to
acknowledge his existence

75
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,800
in order to receive the medal from him.

76
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,800
Thanks, Spock.
You're the pride of the Federation.

77
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
Jared, give it back.

78
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
I didn't take the stupid medal!

79
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
- You're such a liar!
- Conflict.

80
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
- Shut up, Simon!
- Shut up, Simon!

81
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
Hey!

82
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,520
We're not gonna do this.

83
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,000
New town. New house. New job.

84
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,320
This is our new life.

85
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's not fall into old ruts, okay?

86
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,120
I know this house isn't perfect,
but we can make it work,

87
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
if we want to make it work.

88
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
- All right?
- All right, Mom.

89
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
Shut up!

90
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,720
Hi.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
- Dad.
- Dad.

92
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
Yeah, we made it.

93
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
What's that noise in the background?

94
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,720
You know, scratch that.
I don't want to know.

95
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,560
- Just because I don't.
- I'm gonna go look for my medal.

96
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll help you.

97
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

98
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,960
It's your dad.

99
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,040
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

100
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
<i>How's the Addams Family mansion?</i>

101
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, the house? Yeah, it's great,

102
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
if you like big creepy houses
in the middle of nowhere.

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,400
<i>- Now, come on.
- Seriously. There's nothing here.</i>

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,640
<i>- You'll see.
- Yeah, well, listen...</i>

105
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,600
<i>- You're still coming tomorrow, right?
- Yeah, maybe. I'm gonna try.</i>

106
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,560
<i>- Why maybe?
- Look, don't worry. I'm coming.</i>

107
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,040
<i>There's something
we need to talk about.</i>

108
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,280
<i>But tomorrow might not work out, okay?</i>

109
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,120
<i>- Yeah, I understand.
- Okay, good.</i>

110
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,720
<i>- You'll try though, right?
- Absolutely.</i>

111
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,120
<i>But I'll see you soon, though. Definitely.</i>

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay.

113
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
<i>- See you, Son.
- Bye, Dad.</i>

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,600
What did you say to him?

115
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,000
Can't you at least pretend
you want him to come and see us?

116
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
Jared Grace, put that broom down!

117
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,680
- There's something in the wall!
- Now!

118
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,680
You said you were gonna stop
hitting things when you got angry!

119
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
I know I said I was gonna stop yelling.
Please, please, don't do this.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,640
We'll clean it up, Mom.
You go to bed. You need to sleep.

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,560
- Nice move, pinhead.
- Shut up.

122
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,160
Something's in there, moving.

123
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,400
Probably a red squirrel.
Very common in this region.

124
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,600
Or it could just be a rat.

125
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
We don't need any more holes
in the wall!

126
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Great. I'll get blamed for that.

127
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,000
Check it out.

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,520
This is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs.

129
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,960
- What are they called?
- Dumbwaiter.

130
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,680
Hey, those are Mom's keys.

131
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
And my medal!

132
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
What? You still think I took it.

133
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,400
Yeah, Mal, you busted me.

134
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,320
I took your medal,
hid it here and re-plastered the wall.

135
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,480
I don't know how you did it.

136
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,320
I just know you did it,
because you always do it.

137
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,000
- And now you're gonna clean it up.
- You told Mom we were gonna clean it.

138
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
We means you.

139
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,040
Simon, don't you want to know
where this thing goes?

140
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,520
Not really.

141
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,400
Simon!

142
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,320
Simon, wake up!

143
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,280
I went up. It's a room,
a secret room, upstairs.

144
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
There's a desk and a chest,
and I found this book!

145
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,840
- Something was in there!
- A red squirrel?

146
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
No, not a squirrel.
Unless squirrels can spell.

147
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,880
It wrote in the dust on the desk,
"Jared Grace, leave this place."

148
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,080
Wow.

149
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,800
That's really... impossible.

150
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,160
It's late.

151
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
Just go to sleep.

152
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,760
"Do not dare to read this book,

153
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,160
for if you take one fateful look,

154
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,520
you barter at your life's expense
and face a deadly consequence."

155
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,840
What the...

156
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
How did you guys get out?

157
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>Dear reader,</i>

158
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
<i>what you now hold in your hands
is the culmination of a life's work.</i>

159
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
<i>And you will soon see, as I have,</i>

160
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,160
<i>that there are fantastical creatures
living among us,</i>

161
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,800
<i>hidden through mimicry and magic.</i>

162
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
<i>This book will give you
the tools and techniques</i>

163
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,920
<i>needed to lift the veil
and see the unseen.</i>

164
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,680
<i>The secrets you are about to learn
have been kept hidden for ages,</i>

165
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,080
<i>secrets that many of this realm
would prefer to stay hidden.</i>

166
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,160
<i>The creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold,</i>

167
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
<i>and most of them do not
like being observed.</i>

168
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,920
<i>But, over time,
I have garnered their trust.</i>

169
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,720
<i>Some, I am quite happy to report,
I now call friend.</i>

170
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,960
<i>But a rare few are, quite frankly,
to be feared.</i>

171
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,720
<i>The darker forces of this realm
all live in service of one creature,</i>

172
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,560
<i>the ogre, Mulgarath.</i>

173
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,680
<i>The secrets herein are powerful,
more powerful than even I was aware.</i>

174
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,400
<i>Never before has knowledge
of the fantastical realm</i>

175
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
<i>been assembled in one tome.</i>

176
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,160
<i>And so I implore you, dear reader,
to use this information wisely,</i>

177
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,280
<i>for the ogre, Mulgarath,
seeks this knowledge</i>

178
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
<i>with relentless persistence.</i>

179
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,440
<i>If he were to obtain the information
in these pages,</i>

180
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
<i>I can assure you his intentions
would be of the vilest sort.</i>

181
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>He assumes many forms,</i>

182
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,400
<i>and so you must constantly
be on guard.</i>

183
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,800
<i>I deeply fear that the more I learn,</i>

184
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>the more I place everyone around me
in grave danger.</i>

185
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,800
<i>So, reader, beware.</i>

186
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,760
<i>I beseech you, beware.</i>

187
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,040
Mom!

188
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,560
- What's going on?
- Mom! Mom, please, help!

189
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,960
What happened to you?

190
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,560
- Hold still.
- Please, Mom, just cut it! Cut it!

191
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
- Okay, calm down.
- Mom, please!

192
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,920
Just cut me out! Cut it out!

193
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
Please, just get a scissors! I don't care!

194
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,480
- What happened?
- He ruined my hair! Get him out!

195
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,640
Jared, you've gone way too far this time.

196
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,680
- Mom, please! Please!
- What? I didn't do this!

197
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,840
I've been sitting in a footlocker
for the last two hours, reading!

198
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Yeah, right!

199
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,560
Ask Simon.

200
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,320
Well, he was in a footlocker.

201
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,560
- Just cut me out!
- Field guide.

202
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,680
Mom, just cut it!

203
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm not enjoying this.

204
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
I told you, I'll help you catch
a woodchuck or something.

205
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,880
I need the practice. Now, come on.

206
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
Simon!

207
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,160
That's not fair. He distracted me.

208
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
- What does "appease" mean?
- "Appease."

209
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
You know, placate, pacify, assuage.

210
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,720
- In English.
- To make nice.

211
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Is that what you came out here to do?
Well, apology not accepted.

212
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,320
I'm not apologizing 'cause I didn't do it!
This did.

213
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
A brownie is living in the house
and wants us to leave.

214
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
Wow. That's incredible.

215
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,400
You can read!

216
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I'm telling you,
something is in that house with us,

217
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
and Arthur Spiderwick knew about it,

218
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
and that's why he wrote this guide!

219
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,840
I'm a little lost.
Who needs to be appeased?

220
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,280
- The brownie?
- No, a boggart.

221
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,080
So there's a brownie and a boggart?

222
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,280
A brownie turns into a boggart
when it's angry,

223
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,960
and it got angry
when Mallory destroyed his nest.

224
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,560
It likes honey.

225
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,800
- That's why all the honey's there.
- Really?

226
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,560
Don't listen to him, Simon.

227
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Come on, let's go eat.

228
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,640
Hello!

229
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,320
Hello?

230
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,720
Sorry I wrecked your home,
but I made you a new one.

231
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
And I got you some honey.

232
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
I read you liked it.

233
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
Hope you do.

234
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
Hope it, you know, appeases you.

235
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
I'll be over here.

236
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm really hoping you actually exist.

237
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,080
Hello?

238
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,760
Oh! My, my, my.

239
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,840
That is just tasty, tasty, delicious honey.

240
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
So good! So yummy, yummy, yummy!

241
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,000
Wait! No! I won't hurt you!

242
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,240
Here, here, have some more honey!

243
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,360
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.
I mean, if you insist.

244
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,080
Oh, my, my, my! That is good!

245
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Where are you? Why can't I see you?

246
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,560
You don't see us, but now you do.
But only if we want you to.

247
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,880
We? You mean
all the magical creatures

248
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,920
Arthur Spiderwick wrote about.

249
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,560
The book! Oh, my gosh!

250
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm sorry, master, I've failed!
Failed, failed, failed!

251
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,920
Your instructions were simple,
"Protect the book."

252
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,480
And I did it, I hid it,
I bound it and I wound it.

253
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,840
I did my best, locked it in the chest!

254
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,520
But you looked and looked
and found the book!

255
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,760
And from the chest,
the thing was stolen!

256
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
You foolish boy!

257
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,400
Idiot! Are you blind?
I put a note right on the cover!

258
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
Can't you read?

259
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
Why do I write notes
when no one's gonna read the notes?

260
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm sorry. Here! More honey!

261
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,520
No! I'm not falling for that!

262
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,840
Oh, that is so good.

263
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,880
And they say I've got anger issues.

264
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
"Protect the book. Don't let it get took!"

265
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
Right, you had to protect the book.
Who told you to protect it?

266
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,480
- Wait! What did I say?
- Protect the book, protect the book.

267
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,760
It wasn't complicated.
I just had to protect the book. That's all.

268
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,920
Arthur Spiderwick.

269
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,840
So he wrote it
and asked you to protect it.

270
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,720
I said, "Master, we must destroy it!"

271
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,960
He said, "We must protect the book.

272
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,960
Keep it in the circle,
safe from the ogre."

273
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,760
Ogre? Do you mean Mulgarath?

274
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,360
All the years protecting it
now ruined by a little twit!

275
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,040
Circle, circle, little jerkle.
Little jerkle broke the circle!

276
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,120
Whoa! Stop! What circle?

277
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,360
Okay.

278
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Look. Here, here.

279
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,320
So it protects the house
to protect the book.

280
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
- Safe from who?
- Them!

281
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,800
What? Who's them?
I don't see anything.

282
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Tibbsy, come here, boy!

283
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,280
Breakfast time! Mr. Tibbs?

284
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,440
All right, what did you do
with Simon's cat?

285
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,600
They're not here for the cat.
They want the book!

286
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
What is that? What's out there?

287
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,880
It's goblins! Goblins are here.

288
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,280
And all because
you took the book out there

289
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,760
and practically waved it in their faces,
you little twerp!

290
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,120
Simon!

291
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Go ahead!
Now look at the mess you made!

292
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,440
Simon! They're taking him away.
What's happening?

293
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,920
The Stone! The Stone!
Look through the Stone!

294
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,320
What the hell?

295
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
No! No!

296
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,000
- The book stays or we all die!
- I need it! Let go!

297
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,400
It must stay in the circle! In the circle!

298
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
Mom!

299
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,320
Mom!

300
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,760
- Mom! Where's Mom?
- She went to work, okay? I'm in charge.

301
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,520
Hey, where are you going?

302
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Psycho.

303
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
Help me!

304
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,160
What are you doing? Help!

305
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,160
Help!

306
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,720
Give me, give me.

307
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
Give me a leg! Hey, give me!

308
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,360
Give me a leg! A leg!

309
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,040
That's not a leg!

310
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,880
This is a leg! Imbeciles.

311
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh, my God.

312
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,080
Simon.

313
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,640
Don't move.

314
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,800
Slowly lift your foot.

315
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,800
Then we must shake on our alliance.

316
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,320
What? It's good.

317
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,160
- Who are you?
- I am Hogsqueal.

318
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,920
And I am here on a mission
to destroy the ogre, Mulgarath,

319
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
who killed my family!

320
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,560
Can you help me save my brother?
Please?

321
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,240
Yeah! Sure!

322
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,440
I was gonna suggest that
right after you let me out of this cage.

323
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
- So, come on! Free me!
- Okay, okay.

324
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,800
Get it open. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

325
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Now get behind me
and keep your mouth shut.

326
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay, here's our plan.

327
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,560
I will find a safe position over there
and create a distraction with my stick.

328
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,160
Then you leap out with your knife
and finish the beast yourself.

329
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,160
I like that plan.
That's a good plan. I'm smart.

330
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,880
What beast?

331
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,240
The ogre, of course! Mulgarath!

332
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,800
- I just want to save my brother.
- Again with the brother?

333
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
Okay, fine. If we kill them,
saving him will be much easier.

334
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,240
Trust me. Now drop that stone.

335
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,000
You'll need both hands
to choke a goblin.

336
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
But how do I see without...

337
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,480
Nailed him!

338
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,600
I have given you the Sight,
a gift only a hobgoblin can bestow.

339
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,880
Oh, gross!

340
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,080
You're welcome. Now, let's go.

341
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,320
- Simon!
- Jared.

342
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

343
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,800
Jared, what's happening?
Get me out of here.

344
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,240
Just hang on.

345
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
I'm gonna cut you out.

346
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,640
- Jared!
- Get back.

347
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Hide.

348
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
Jared!

349
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,360
Mulgarath!

350
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,560
Mulgarath!

351
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,600
Mulgarath!

352
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,520
Mulgarath!

353
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Mulgarath!

354
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,000
- What are they doing?
- Summoning Mulgarath. Get ready.

355
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,480
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

356
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,520
That's Mulgarath?

357
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,200
That's the ogre
you're all freaked out about?

358
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
That old man?

359
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,920
Don't be fooled
by what you think you see.

360
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,920
That's just what he wants.

361
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
I beg your forgiveness.

362
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,040
I asked my friends here
to invite you to a nice little meeting.

363
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,680
Then they got a bit overzealous.

364
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,640
That's a goblin for you.

365
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,440
My apologies.

366
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
What do you want with me?

367
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
It's not what I want with you.

368
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
It's what I want from you.

369
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,400
Arthur Spiderwick's field guide.

370
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,240
I know you found it.

371
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,000
That's right, you can simply
walk back the way you came.

372
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,240
Just give me the book.

373
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,800
I don't have it.

374
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
I don't. Look.

375
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
Search him!

376
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,320
What? If Mulgarath learns the secrets
in that book,

377
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,360
he could kill us all!

378
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,760
He's weak in his human form.
It's now or never.

379
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,880
Come! Death to the ogre!

380
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,040
Bird!

381
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Delicious! Come back here!

382
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,680
I'll be back! Kill him if you get a chance!
Remember the plan!

383
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,920
Move!

384
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,600
Pockets. Search the pockets.

385
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,760
The pockets! No, these!

386
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
These are pockets, idiot!

387
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,720
Master, this is all we found.

388
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Do they have the book?

389
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,120
No.

390
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,160
But I know where it is.
I'll go get it and give it to you. I swear.

391
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm placing my trust in you.

392
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,720
If you give me the book,

393
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,840
your life will go on
as if nothing ever happened.

394
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,680
However, if you fail,

395
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,440
I'm afraid I'll have to find somebody else
to get my book for me.

396
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,040
Go. Go on.

397
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,560
Run along.

398
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Go.

399
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,200
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

400
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,960
You failed me, Redcap!

401
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,720
There are two human boys
with the same faces.

402
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,440
The Jared and the not Jared.
We took the wrong one.

403
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,320
Then find the Jared,
get the book and kill them!

404
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,080
Kill them all!

405
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,400
Move out!

406
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,160
Stupid!

407
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,560
Stupid!

408
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,640
Those things were gonna kill me
over your stupid, stupid book!

409
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,520
- They're right over there.
- I can't take this.

410
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,360
Let's just get to the house
and give it to them.

411
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,080
Hey, it's not at the house.
It's right here in my backpack.

412
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,400
- What? Then let's just give it to them.
- No, they'll just kill us anyway!

413
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,360
Well, let's just...

414
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
- Give it!
- Stop!

415
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Give it!

416
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,560
Book!

417
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,880
- Get them! Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

418
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,800
After them!

419
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Get them! Get them! Rip them apart!

420
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,560
But not the book! Don't hurt the book!

421
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,360
Jared! Jared! Over here!
Help me! Help me!

422
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,520
Come on!

423
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,120
- Calm down!
- Keep them away! Keep them away!

424
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,360
It's okay. There's a protective circle
around the house.

425
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,680
- We're safe inside it.
- There you are.

426
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,880
You know, Mom left me in charge,

427
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,280
so you can't just run off
without telling me.

428
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,240
- Get her.
- Mallory, this way, now!

429
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,320
Now! Now!

430
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,960
- What? Don't yell at me.
- Mal, come on! Come on!

431
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
Run to the front door, fast!

432
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm not running anywhere,
and stop throwing rocks at me!

433
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,120
Listen to him!
You're surrounded by goblins!

434
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,880
Get inside the protective circle!

435
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,440
Oh, God, Simon,
he's got you in on this now?

436
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,800
For the last time,
there's no such thing as...

437
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,560
What's happening?

438
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
No, Mallory, they're short.
Aim below your knees. 10 o'clock.

439
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
10 o'clock!

440
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,000
Mallory! Mallory! 12 o'clock!

441
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,640
Behind you! Behind you! 6 o'clock!

442
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,000
3 o'clock! 3 o'clock!

443
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,800
Come back! You're safe. You're safe.

444
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,240
You're safe.

445
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,600
Now do you believe me?

446
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
Mom!

447
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,600
It's gonna be bad! It's bad!

448
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,560
- Oh, God.
- No, that's bad.

449
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,280
- Mom!
- Jared!

450
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,760
- What were those things?
- I told you, goblins.

451
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,240
It's okay, Simon. It's okay.

452
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,160
No, it's not okay! It's not! It's not!

453
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
He's right. What am I saying?
Of course it isn't!

454
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,880
How many of those things
are out there?

455
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,640
I don't know! I don't know! Okay?
Sit tight! I'll be right back!

456
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,160
Jared! God, he's gonna get us all killed!

457
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I'll be right back. Keep pressure on that.

458
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
Pressure? What?

459
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,840
Jared?

460
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,840
Why are they doing this?
What do they want from us?

461
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,200
The book.

462
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,360
Oh, God!
They're coming from everywhere!

463
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,080
I know, I can see.

464
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

465
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,120
Where did you get that book?

466
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,360
So, the book was in here
with a big warning that said,

467
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,320
"Do not read," and you read it?

468
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,920
It's a book. I didn't think reading it
would unleash goblin fury, okay?

469
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,160
But that's the thing,
you never think of anything!

470
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
- You're always doing this!
- Yeah, right.

471
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,520
You don't think, you just do!

472
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,280
Maybe I could think if you'd stop talking.

473
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
You do stuff and we pay for it.

474
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,600
Hey, if you're so smart,
what do you think we should do with it?

475
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,520
If freaky goblins want this book,
I say we give it to them!

476
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
No!

477
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,200
Back off! The book stays here!

478
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,360
- Right here! Here, here, here!
- No! Mallory, no! No!

479
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,600
What is that hideous thing?

480
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,880
Haven't I made myself that clear?
Touch it and you'll pay!

481
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,920
- Stop it! Chill! Chill!
- Touch it and I'll bite your fingers off!

482
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Get me some honey from the kitchen.

483
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
- What?
- Just do it!

484
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
Come on, try it! Try it!
I invite you to try it!

485
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
- Go!
- You'll be fingerless, you...

486
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,520
You, get away!

487
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,120
- You ruined everything!
- Okay, protect the book.

488
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,160
Okay, I promise.

489
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,800
- Mallory!
- I'm coming!

490
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,520
- Okay, honey's coming, honey's coming.
- Idiots!

491
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,000
- I don't need your stinking honey!
- Here, drink, drink.

492
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,520
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's okay?

493
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
There is so much about this
that's not okay.

494
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,720
I don't even know where to start.

495
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,800
Why can I see him
without that stone thing?

496
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,360
Because he's letting you see.

497
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,760
Thimbletack, what happens
if goblins get the book?

498
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,760
You die, I die, we all die. Bye-bye.

499
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,240
- What does he mean, we all die?
- I think he means we all die.

500
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,880
He can't know the secrets. He can't!
The ogre is not to be trusted.

501
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,080
He's right. We can't give it to Mulgarath.

502
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,840
He'll just kill us anyway.
I heard him say so.

503
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
Then let's just burn it.

504
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,240
No!

505
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,240
No!

506
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,520
Give it! Give the book!

507
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,760
Give it!

508
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,200
Sorry, master! Forgive us!

509
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Give the book!

510
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,840
Okay, okay, okay, wait!

511
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
You win. You are strong,
smart human boy.

512
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,520
So don't be foolish. Give us the book.
We'll leave you alone.

513
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,920
I don't believe you!

514
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
No!

515
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,080
Now you've done it! Now you will pay!

516
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,320
Book!

517
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,680
Book, book, book.

518
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,960
Book, book, book, book, book.

519
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,400
- It's cold.
- You can't stay in the circle forever.

520
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,280
And when you leave, here we will be.

521
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,680
Let me guess,
the book's got a charm on it.

522
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,560
Lest there fall any more harm on it.

523
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,760
Great.

524
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,880
- They're not leaving.
- I know.

525
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,880
- They're never leaving!
- I heard you.

526
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,160
- Why does he want that book so bad?
- I don't know.

527
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,680
Well, figure it out!

528
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,520
All I know is Mulgarath
can't break the circle without this book,

529
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,480
so we're safe as long as
we stay in the house.

530
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Until when?

531
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,400
We stay here long enough,
we're gonna end up like her!

532
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
Wait a minute.

533
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,120
- She can help us.
- Aunt Lucinda? Are you kidding?

534
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,080
We don't even know her
or where she is!

535
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,440
I think I do.

536
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,000
She's at the Woodhaven Sanatorium.

537
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,200
But how do you get to her?

538
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,400
- There, all safe.
- Good. Now go. Make haste.

539
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,880
Okay, I think I have this figured out.

540
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,000
Some sort of secret tunnel system,
goes all the way to town.

541
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,000
About a mile, that way.

542
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,400
The first ladder you find, go up,
and the sanatorium's here.

543
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,640
Thanks.

544
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,240
You ready?

545
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,640
Oh, yeah. Now I'm ready.

546
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,480
- All right. Let's go.
- Mallory?

547
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,840
I already told you, Simon, you can't go.
Not with that leg, you'll slow us down.

548
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
I know, but I found this.
It'll make it easier for you to see.

549
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,600
Okay, Simon?

550
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,560
Go!

551
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,680
- Hey, are you there?
- Show yourselves!

552
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Yeah, right here, on the porch!
Come to me on the porch!

553
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,800
Yeah, yeah, good.
Right here, over here.

554
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Yeah, are you hungry?

555
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,280
- Right here on the porch.
- Come on. Hurry up. Get in.

556
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,960
Go! Go! Go!
They're coming! Open the door!

557
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,360
Jared, hurry!

558
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
- Come on!
- Get in, get in!

559
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,880
Let's go! Go, go, go!

560
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,080
Wait, wait, wait.

561
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,280
This way, this way, this way.

562
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

563
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,920
Dig! Dig!

564
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,360
Go!

565
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,400
"Goblin defenses.

566
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,920
Tomato sauce burns the skin like acid.

567
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,000
Vinegar fumes asphyxiates.

568
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,960
Salt, blinding effect."

569
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,800
Are there more?
What does the book say?

570
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,040
- Step away from the book!
- Okay, okay, you open it.

571
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,040
Where is it?
Where did he put it? Where?

572
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,400
Oh, there.

573
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
Oh, no. Jared.

574
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,120
- What did you do with it? Liars! Liars!
- No, it wasn't me.

575
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,200
All of you, liars! Where's the book?

576
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,960
- You brought the book?
- We need to show it to Lucinda.

577
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,840
- Which way goes into town?
- Right.

578
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,400
Get the troll.

579
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,960
Now left. Go left!

580
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,240
- It's a mole troll.
- What?

581
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,400
Run!

582
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,120
This way!

583
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,720
Go, go, go!

584
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,720
Jared!

585
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,160
Jared!

586
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,360
Jared, come on!

587
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,080
Are you okay?
Oh, man, did I hit somebody?

588
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,720
Yes. Thank you!

589
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,760
Then you hit F1, tab, tab.

590
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,240
Then shift-return to get the total.

591
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,920
I know, it's a lot to remember,
but let's just go through it again.

592
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,160
Here you go.

593
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,880
So tomato sauce really kills goblins?

594
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,040
Jared, come on.

595
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,520
- You're really in a hurry.
- We're just really excited to see her.

596
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,400
- Those are nice flowers and sword.
- I take fencing.

597
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,520
Lucinda? You have visitors.

598
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,480
More salt.

599
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,680
There, there, there, now.
It's okay. It's okay.

600
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,240
Aunt Lucinda?

601
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm Mallory Grace,
and this is my brother, Jared.

602
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,120
Our mom's Helen.

603
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,240
We have some questions.

604
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,800
- See, we moved into your house.
- What?

605
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,760
Oh, no, no, no.

606
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,840
No, it isn't safe.

607
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,600
Why have you done this?

608
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,400
Mom said you gave it to her
since she's the only living heir.

609
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
- No, you have to get out of there.
- We can't.

610
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,040
We don't have anywhere else to go.

611
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,400
- It isn't safe. You don't understand.
- Yes, we do.

612
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,440
We know everything. We've seen.

613
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,800
It's okay. They've seen.

614
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,080
Mallory, look.

615
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,080
No, no, not for you.

616
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,240
She's right.

617
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,640
Eat that and you'll never crave
human food again.

618
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,200
- How do you know that?
- I found this.

619
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,960
Your father's field guide.

620
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
Inside, quickly, quickly!

621
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,400
Quickly!

622
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,000
Do you know what you've done
by bringing it outside the circle?

623
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,120
Don't you know what could happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

624
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,640
No, we don't.
That's why I brought it to you.

625
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,640
Then you haven't read it.

626
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,640
He did.

627
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,160
Then you know more than you should.

628
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,160
And your lives are in danger.

629
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,440
Didn't you read the note?

630
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,640
Please. We don't know what to do.

631
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,520
Can't you tell us something
that'll help us?

632
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,440
This book has brought nothing
but heartache and misery to my family.

633
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,320
I would say it was his life's work,
but, in truth, it was his life.

634
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,800
<i>The last day I saw him
he was so agitated,</i>

635
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,480
<i>almost delirious.</i>

636
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,640
<i>I remember him
running through the house,</i>

637
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,640
<i>a crazed look in his eyes.</i>

638
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,480
<i>That was the day he created the circle.</i>

639
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,440
<i>A book Mulgarath would use
to destroy all the other faeries.</i>

640
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,400
<i>And then nothing could stop him,
even humans,</i>

641
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,040
from becoming the most powerful
creature the world had ever known.

642
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,360
<i>My father immediately did everything
he could to protect us.</i>

643
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,920
<i>Everything except...</i>

644
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,560
Master must destroy the book!

645
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,840
No! We need to protect it!

646
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,400
Keep it inside the circle,
safe from the ogre!

647
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,560
I just need more time, Thimbletack.
I need more time.

648
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,600
But I didn't know
about the circle, you see.

649
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,920
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

650
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,200
<i>Falling down</i>

651
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,480
Oh, no!

652
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,080
<i>Falling down</i>

653
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,520
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

654
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,080
Lucy!

655
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,440
Come away from the toadstools!

656
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,840
- What?
- Stay inside the circle!

657
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,080
- I can't hear you!
- Lucy! No!

658
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,600
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

659
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,040
Daddy! Please, help me!
Somebody's dragging me, Daddy!

660
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,000
- Leave her alone!
- Daddy!

661
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,360
Lucy, come! Come! Stay there!

662
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,160
- Stay inside the circle!
- Daddy! Daddy, what's going on?

663
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,760
- What's happening?
- Don't go over the mushrooms! No!

664
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,680
What are those?
Daddy, what are those things?

665
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,040
Tell me!

666
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,800
Daddy! Daddy?

667
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,520
Daddy?

668
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,840
<i>The sylph protect
the entire faerie realm,</i>

669
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,840
<i>and the secrets my father discovered
put them in danger.</i>

670
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,920
<i>So they rescued him from the goblins,</i>

671
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,920
<i>but took him away from me.</i>

672
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,480
- Daddy!
- Lucy! I'll be back!

673
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,440
Each day,

674
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,560
I would stare down that drive,

675
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,920
and dream of him
walking up those steps

676
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,600
and holding me in his arms once again.

677
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
But he never did.

678
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,520
One night, I dreamt that I saw him
in the woods.

679
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,920
So I went out to look for him,

680
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,400
but something wouldn't let me.

681
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,720
When they say suicide
and you say goblins,

682
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,520
here is where they put you.

683
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,200
They thought I'd read the book, you see.

684
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,360
Mulgarath will stop at nothing
to get these secrets,

685
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,080
which is why you and your family
are in grave danger.

686
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,440
And there is only one person
who can help you.

687
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,600
- Who?
- My father.

688
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,080
Your father? But your father's dead.

689
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,520
No! No, no, he's not dead.

690
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,000
The sprites have told me he's alive,

691
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,640
held captive by the sylph
for all that he knows.

692
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,080
You must find him,

693
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,880
bring him his book
and have him destroy it.

694
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,320
It is your only hope.

695
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,760
- No!
- Give me that!

696
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,600
Where did he come from?

697
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,080
- No!
- Horrible, horrible!

698
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,840
Mom?

699
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,680
Useless!

700
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,960
- Worthless! No.
- Wait. Wait.

701
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,160
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's this? What's this? No?

702
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
You had the book in your possession,

703
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,920
and all you bring me is pages
of nixies and phooka habitats!

704
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,360
Don't hurt me.

705
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,800
It hurts!

706
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,560
"Charm for protective circle."

707
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,280
Forgive me, master.

708
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,040
When the moon rises,
the book will be mine.

709
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,360
Redcap, we have a potion to make.

710
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Oh, no. This is not good.

711
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,280
Must find human boy. Must warn him.

712
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,200
Or maybe I'll just hide. I like that plan.

713
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,800
So, you say you found this book,

714
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,480
and it tells you how to see faeries
and goblins and magic sprites,

715
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,560
and that's what this is all about.

716
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,040
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

717
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,000
- What do you think about all this, Mal?
- It's true, Mom.

718
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,640
No, it's not!

719
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,440
Do you really think I am so stupid
that I don't see what this is about?

720
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,800
You hate the house

721
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,960
and you want to go back to New York
and to our old life!

722
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,440
Well, let me just be really clear
when I say

723
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,840
that isn't gonna happen.

724
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,600
Because we can't afford New York,
because...

725
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,000
This is why Dad left, you know.

726
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,760
Excuse me?

727
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,920
When someone's trying to tell you
something you don't wanna hear,

728
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,080
this is what you do.

729
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,240
You just stop listening and start yelling.

730
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,720
You did it to Dad all the time.

731
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,080
- Stop it.
- I saw you.

732
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,760
Yeah, you saw what you wanted to see.

733
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,720
You wouldn't listen,
and that's why he left!

734
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,480
Get out.

735
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,440
- What?
- I said get out.

736
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,160
Gladly.

737
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,720
I hate you,
and I don't want to live with you!

738
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,560
Don't you think you should just tell him?

739
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,360
Go inside, Mal.
We'll deal with this when I get home.

740
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,680
Oh, my! We're so organized.
Organized, organized, organized.

741
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,320
Look at that. That's very good.
More bombs for you.

742
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,000
The book! What happened to the book?
What did you do to the book?

743
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,040
- It's okay, it's okay. I'll talk to him.
- Stained!

744
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,920
You said you wouldn't take the book,
and you lied!

745
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,120
- You tricked him!
- I know. I'm sorry.

746
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,800
Jared, I think you should come
and see this.

747
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,640
See? No goblins.

748
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,440
- Do you think they've given up?
- Wrong!

749
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,000
Goblins don't give up.
They're too stupid to know how.

750
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,200
They're relentless,
and they're out there right now, plotting,

751
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,520
which is why I came back for you.

752
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,600
Now is the perfect time to...

753
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,280
Bird! Bird!

754
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,840
Come here, come here, come here.
Don't go up there! No, come here!

755
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,080
- What is that?
- It's Hogsqueal.

756
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,200
Wait a minute.

757
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,960
- Do birds live in these little houses?
- Yeah.

758
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,680
Oh, my gosh. That's genius.
Who thought of that?

759
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,920
You can stick your tongue right in.

760
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,680
Hogsqueal! Hogsqueal!

761
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,600
You said the goblins are plotting.
To do what?

762
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,880
They have pages of the book.
That stupid book!

763
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,160
You don't understand.
I talked to Spiderwick.

764
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,400
I shared hobgoblin secrets.

765
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,200
But Mulgarath stole just that one page,
then used it to kill my entire family!

766
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,240
If he gets ahold of the whole book,

767
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,600
he will do the same to everyone,
including you!

768
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,560
And now he's coming.
"When the moon rises," he said.

769
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,480
But we'll be waiting. We'll set a trap.

770
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,360
You with your knife and me hiding safely
near these bird homes.

771
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,680
- Who is that? Who's up there?
- More humungous humans!

772
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,760
Recruits for the alliance!

773
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,520
Huh? Huh? Join us on our quest!

774
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,480
Vengeance or death!

775
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,000
Hopefully vengeance.

776
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,080
Okay, here's the plan.

777
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,480
No, no. Wait, wait, wait!
We must unite! We must stay focused!

778
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,520
Dad, I've left like four messages.

779
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,400
Why haven't you called back?

780
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,960
Where are you?

781
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,440
You've got to come here right now.
There's all this crazy...

782
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,920
All this weird stuffs been happening.

783
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,640
Bad stuff, real bad.

784
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,840
And you, you said
you were gonna come get me.

785
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,480
So where are you?

786
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,360
He's not coming, is he?

787
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,520
He's with someone else.

788
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,600
He's moved in with her.

789
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,920
He's not getting back with Mom.

790
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,600
He's not.

791
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,440
Mom wanted him to tell you himself.

792
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,800
She's been waiting for him to do that.

793
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,600
It's okay, Tibbsy. It's okay.

794
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,160
Oh, God, they're coming.

795
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,160
Jared, what do we do now?

796
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,360
Lucinda said our only chance

797
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,160
is to take the book to Arthur Spiderwick
and have him destroy it.

798
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,320
What?

799
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,960
We don't even know if he's alive,
let alone how to find him.

800
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,640
- What? What are you looking for?
- He had a pet.

801
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,000
A pet?
And Fluffy the dog is gonna save us?

802
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,840
It wasn't a dog. It was this, a griffin.

803
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,400
"When I call upon him
in the native tongue of the tree elf

804
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,800
with whom he dwells,
he comes to my assistance."

805
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,840
See? His pet can find him.

806
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Summon a griffin in native tree elf

807
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,840
to find a 125-year-old man
who may or may not be alive?

808
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,480
That's our plan?

809
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,560
And you know how to summon
a griffin in native tree elf?

810
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,960
Of course.

811
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,160
Is that it?

812
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,600
Did it work?

813
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,440
I guess not.

814
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,320
Whoa! That sounds like a big one.

815
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,400
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

816
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,840
- Jared! Jared!
- Simon, be careful!

817
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,240
Yes, yes, yes! Find Arthur Spiderwick.
Bring him the book.

818
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,640
There's your ride. Off you go.
Go, go, go!

819
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,600
What? You want us to ride that beast?

820
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,040
He's not a beast. He's a bird.

821
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,680
He's a big-boned bird!

822
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,240
There's no way we can possibly...

823
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,560
It's okay. Calm down. It's okay.

824
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,920
Cool pet.

825
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,880
Hurry up! What are you waiting for?
Get on him!

826
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,480
My God, it's him.

827
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,040
Arthur Spiderwick.

828
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,640
He's alive.

829
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,880
Whoa.

830
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,280
- How are we gonna get home?
- Arthur Spiderwick?

831
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,480
Thank God we found you.

832
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,080
You don't even know
what we've been through.

833
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,560
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- Not really.

834
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,880
Lucinda, your daughter,
our great-aunt, she sent us.

835
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,240
Lucy? She's only 6-and-a-half years old.

836
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,800
No. No, she's 86-and-a-half.

837
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,720
Well, that's nonsense.
I was with her only this morning.

838
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,040
Or was that yesterday?

839
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,360
No, that was 80 years ago!

840
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,680
Listen, you gotta believe me.
You're my great-great-uncle.

841
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,880
Help me out, guys.

842
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,120
Guys?

843
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,680
What's happening?
What's the matter with them?

844
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,160
The sylphs.

845
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,040
Their songs must have altered
my perception of time.

846
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,800
That is what they do.

847
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,440
Lucy's an old woman now, you say?

848
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,240
That must mean that my wife is...

849
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,520
Oh, my God, what have I done?

850
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,320
Look, I'm sorry about all that, really.

851
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,040
But you gotta help us. I found your book.

852
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,680
The field guide? No!
No, not here. Not now.

853
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,600
Don't listen to them.

854
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,520
Follow me.

855
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,240
Here! Under here!
Quickly, while they're distracted.

856
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,400
The book, give me the book.

857
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,200
Oh, the field guide.

858
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,280
The field guide.

859
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,640
You should never have read this.

860
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,640
You should not have brought this
outside the circle.

861
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,520
I know. I know, but I brought it to you
so you could destroy it.

862
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,000
Destroy it?

863
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,560
No. Are you mad?

864
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,560
I have uncovered all of their secrets.

865
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,720
And this book is my validation.
This book is my life.

866
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,280
You're 125 years old! Your life is over!

867
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,320
And your daughter
spent her life without a father,

868
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,320
all because of that book.

869
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,680
I never imagined
that the things I'd learned

870
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,000
could possibly have led to this.

871
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,080
Look, I know stuff I wish I didn't, too,

872
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,040
but there's nothing I can do about that.

873
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,760
One thing I know for sure
is that you gotta destroy that book.

874
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,400
- What's this?
- What?

875
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,360
- What's wrong?
- Where's my book?

876
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,840
- What is this?
- Thimbletack, he switched the pages.

877
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,240
But the real book
is still inside the circle. It's safe.

878
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,600
- No, Mulgarath got pages.
- What?

879
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,480
- He'll break the circle as soon as...
- As soon as the moon rises, I know.

880
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,120
That's when Mom will be getting home.
I gotta get back.

881
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,120
No! They won't let you leave.

882
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,720
They'll keep you here for
the same reason they're keeping me.

883
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,360
We know too much.

884
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,480
Then what are we gonna do?
Please, you've gotta help us!

885
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,480
If I'm as old as you say I am,
I'm useless outside this glade.

886
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,600
The last thing I said to my mom was,
"I hate you."

887
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,760
Listen, son.

888
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,360
The boy who had the tenacity
to find me,

889
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,120
doesn't need my help.

890
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,080
Now, Mulgarath wants the power
that comes with knowledge.

891
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,720
You have that knowledge.

892
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,520
You are the book now.

893
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,520
And you have to get out of here. Now.

894
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,440
Yes!

895
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,120
I think I can distract them.

896
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,600
On my signal,
run to your brother and sister.

897
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,720
You'll only have a few moments
to escape.

898
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,840
- But...
- Await my signal.

899
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,160
But...

900
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,560
Here! Here! I have the field guide!

901
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,680
Do you want it? Yes, here!

902
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,880
Come take it!
You can keep it safe right here!

903
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,440
Now!

904
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,440
Yes, Byron! Yes!

905
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,840
Get them home safely!

906
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,800
Come on, snap out of it! Come on!

907
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,520
Oh, shoot!
They started spreading the potion.

908
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,240
Oh, no. There's Mom.

909
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,040
- Mom! No! Turn around!
- Go away, Mom!

910
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,480
Stop the car!

911
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,720
What?

912
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,960
- Mom, move over!
- What are you doing?

913
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,240
Mallory, you drive!
Get the car inside the circle!

914
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,240
- Go, go!
- You're not driving this car!

915
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,160
Stop it! Mal, stop!

916
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,160
Thank God.

917
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,400
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

918
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,840
- Jared, what do we do now?
- Protect the house.

919
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,800
- Simon, the sage in the planter boxes.
- I know, I know.

920
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,200
- Hang them in the windows!
- I'm on it.

921
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,360
Mal, go upstairs
and get all of Lucinda's salt.

922
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,520
- All of it?
- All of it!

923
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,720
- Okay. Okay.
- Thimbletack!

924
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,920
- Jared!
- Thimbletack!

925
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,320
The circle's about to be broken!
Please come out!

926
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,280
Jared! Jared! What is going on?

927
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,720
- Mom, you've got to believe me. Okay?
- No! No!

928
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,400
One more word about faeries
and goblins and I swear...

929
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,880
Goblins, I know. But I hid the book.
They'll never find it.

930
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,200
Well, I hope they don't. Unless...

931
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,240
Why is she screaming?
I'm the one who should be screaming.

932
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,000
The circle's about to be broken!

933
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,280
Mom, no! He's not the problem.

934
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,760
They are.

935
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,120
Get in there! Get in there!

936
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,240
We have to protect the house.
Understand?

937
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,480
Hurry, hurry! Yeah, get every opening!

938
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,280
Okay, the living room's done!

939
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,440
- Simon, do the music room!
- Okay, okay, I got it!

940
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,040
Steel, it cuts and burns.

941
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,440
Good thing we're New Yorkers.

942
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,640
Wait, wait, here it comes.
Here it comes.

943
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,520
The circle is broken.

944
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,120
The circle is broken.

945
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,520
The circle is broken! Attack!

946
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,760
The windows and doors are protected.

947
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,760
Get down there. Go low! Go low!

948
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,480
Break it! Break on through! Come on!

949
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,120
The rest of you, up! Up, up, up!

950
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,160
Go, you toads! Go! Find the book!

951
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,600
Where did they go?

952
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,640
Did it work?

953
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,880
Come on, Jared! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

954
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,960
Get back, Jared! Get back!

955
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,880
Go, go, go! Run!

956
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,680
Give it to me! Give it to me!

957
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,600
- Simon, get the back door!
- I'm on it!

958
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,160
Mal, help me!

959
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,080
It won't hold for long.

960
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,440
Give me a hand.

961
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,720
Go on! Get in there! Where did they go?

962
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,360
Where are they? Where are they?
Come on, let's find them.

963
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,840
You, over there, to the left.
You, to the right.

964
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,680
Spread out, spread out.

965
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,080
Oh...

966
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,680
Are you okay?

967
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,320
- It worked.
- Yeah.

968
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,400
Book safe?

969
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,320
Yes. Good job, Thimbletack.

970
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,680
Thank God.

971
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,680
What is it?

972
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,920
Come on.

973
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
Dad?

974
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,480
What happened?

975
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,840
Richard?

976
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,640
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on?

977
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,520
Where do we start?

978
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,720
With this, I guess.

979
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,920
What's that? Let me see.

980
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,640
No!

981
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,040
Not until you tell me
what you need to tell me.

982
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,280
What?

983
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,320
The last time we were on the phone,
you said the next time we met,

984
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,880
you had something
you needed to say to me.

985
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,800
So what is it?

986
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,320
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

987
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,960
I just want to hear you say it.

988
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,680
I...

989
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,120
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

990
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,760
Let me see.

991
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,000
Jared.

992
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,280
Wrong answer.

993
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,160
- Jared!
- Get back! Get back!

994
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,200
What did you do?

995
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,520
- It's not Dad!
- What?

996
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,960
Oh, my God!

997
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,640
Now give me the book!

998
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,320
Run, Jared!

999
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,640
Give me the book. Give me the book.

1000
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,040
Back off!

1001
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,160
Thimbletack!

1002
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,560
Give me the book!

1003
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,400
Jared!

1004
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,640
Give me the book!

1005
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,080
Oh, yeah.

1006
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,120
Give me the book now!

1007
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,760
- You want the book?
- Yeah.

1008
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,280
Go get it!

1009
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,000
Jared! Jared!

1010
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,960
- Jared, are you okay?
- Jared, you did it.

1011
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,880
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jared, are you okay?

1012
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,840
Yes! Death to the ogre!

1013
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,720
We did it! You sent him right to me,
and I ate him! That's teamwork!

1014
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,720
The taste of vengeance is sweet!

1015
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,160
I can still taste a little! Oh, it's good!

1016
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,200
I did it! I knew I could do it!
They said I couldn't, but I did it!

1017
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,360
- It's the field guide.
- Here, we'll help you.

1018
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,640
Jared.

1019
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,880
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I mean...

1020
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,560
No, I'm sorry.

1021
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,240
- No, listen, I...
- For what I said, I didn't mean...

1022
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,840
Jared, it's not your fault.

1023
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,360
It's mine.

1024
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,320
I was trying to protect you,

1025
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,400
but I guess I should have
just told you the truth.

1026
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,760
Your dad does love you,
and if you want to stay with him, that's...

1027
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,960
I don't want to live with Dad.

1028
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,000
Is it okay if I stay here with you?

1029
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,520
Is it okay?

1030
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,080
Who else is gonna protect us?

1031
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,400
I'll go put this in your old room.

1032
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,480
My old friend Thimbletack.

1033
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,160
Book safe, Lucy. Book safe.

1034
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,880
And if my father were here,
he'd say, "Job well done."

1035
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,480
Aunt Lucinda?

1036
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,480
I think you should come see this.

1037
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,920
Am I dreaming?

1038
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,120
No, my child. You're not.

1039
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,040
Child?

1040
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,880
Do you know how old I am?

1041
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,840
Yes, I do.

1042
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,880
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,560
I was so captivated by all
the magical creatures I found

1044
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,440
that I lost sight of the one I already had.

1045
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,880
But I see now,

1046
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,320
and I may never be able
to forgive myself.

1047
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,760
You came back as you promised,

1048
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,280
so I forgive you.

1049
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,680
My dear, because the book was saved,

1050
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,160
the sylph allowed me to come see you,

1051
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,920
but I cannot stay.

1052
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,800
Because if I do,

1053
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,480
all my years will come back to me,
all at once, and I will turn to dust.

1054
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,880
Then this time, take me with you.

1055
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,760
Daddy.

1056
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,360
Oh, Lucy.

1057
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,720
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1058
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,640
Hey, come on.

1059
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,160
Fly while you can, griffin.

1060
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,320
I swallowed an ogre whole.
You could be next.
