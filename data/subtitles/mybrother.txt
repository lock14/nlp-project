<i>a cold syringe needle

<i>It seemed so easy for others</i>

87

<i>but it took days for him
to nibble on her nipples.</i>

88

<i>He was hare-lipped.</i>

89

<i>Medically called a cleft palate</i>

90

00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,376
You're so silly.

93
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,983

94
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,187
- Mother.
- What?

95
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,799
C- Can you m-make this
go away too?

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,108
No, I can't.

97
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,642
You know why?

98
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:08,843

99

141
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,011
And I'm good at fighting.

142
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,814

143
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,518
Knock it off!

144
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,820
Go ahead.

145
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,129
- M-Mother is w-waiting.
- I bet.

146
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,532
For your report card!

147
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,627
Sung-hyun, go home.
Go ahead.

148
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,682
Driver, can you hold a second?
Hurry! Come on!

149
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,021
Damn!

150
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,515
My heart almost stopped.

151
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,021
A knockout, huh? CHO Mi-ryung
from HyangDo Girl's High.

152
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,623
A pie in the sky though.

153
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,329
Why?

154
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,437
Her brother is a crazy ass.

155
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,630
Get near her
and you're done for.

156
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,768
Does Lit. Club ring a bell?

157
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,876
She's in the Lit. Club too?

158
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,879
- He is so cute! Isn't he?
- Yeah I saw him too!

159
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,078
- Isn't he a bully?
- He rules DongSung High.

160
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,281
He's so cute and
bully as well?

161
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,882
It will be so lucky
if I get to go out with him.

162
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,290
Give it a try.

163
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,877
Asako and I met three times.

164
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,777
We shouldn't have met
the third time.

165
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,687
I'm going to Chuncheon
this weekend.

166
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,187
It's breathtaking out there.

167
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,101
I might not be able to

168
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,107
see her ever again.

169
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,912
Missing her all my life...

170
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,844
- Ca... Can... Can't see
- Damn.

171
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,319
I've had it!

172
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,124
You either see her or not.

173
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,156
Who the hell is Asako?
Your squeeze?

174
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,660
It was a kick-ass dream.

175
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,964
I have to dream it again!

176
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,888
Why don't you get me one too?

177
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,490
An amulet that will get me
into college without studying.

178
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,197
This is good.

179
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,706
He's a well-known diviner.

180
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,112
He went to Seoul Nat'I University.

181
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,010
What a wasted degree!

182
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,611
It cost me an arm and a leg.
Try it on.

183
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,419
Here.

184
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:04,351
Gosh, you look great
with anything on.

185
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,260
So handsome!

186
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:16,264
- T-This is an expensive brand.
- It is!

187
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,274
I'm not eating!

188
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,283
I wish you had his character.

189
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,092
Hey.

190
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,791
Bring that Burberry jacket.

191
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:54,106
Jong-hyun, this isn't
the real thing.

192
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,908
I know!

193
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,211
You know what?

194
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:06,019
Genuine ones look fake on you
but fakes look genuine on me.

195
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,458
You got that?

196
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,664
Where are you going?

197
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,267
You don't need to know.

198
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,477
Hi.

199
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:32,780
I'm KIM Jong-hyun
from DongSung High.

200
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,781
On this beautiful Sunday

201
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm honored to be here.

202
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,785
I hope we make some
kiss-ass memories together.

203
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,796
Especially on this side...

204
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,497
The fourth girl!

205
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,300
CHO Mi-ryung, right?

206
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:04,042
Mi-ryung.
Nice meeting you.

207
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:20,361
'Aspirin' by CHO Mi-ryung.

208
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,268
I chewed you, Aspirin
for I was sick.

209
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,870
Hidden in that bitterness is

210
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,978
a true confession.

211
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,376
Oh Head, please don't hurt.

212
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,882
Oh Head, please don't hurt.

213
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,796
I chewed you, Aspirin
for I had the flu.

214
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:03,035
Hidden in that bitterness is

215
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,635
a true confession.

216
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,241
It's a killer.

217
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,050
Oh Flu, please go away.

218
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,948
Oh Flu, please go away.

219
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,252
I chewed you, Aspirin
for I had cramps.

220
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,863
Hidden in that bitterness is

221
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,966
a woman's fate.

222
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,371
It's all about feelings.

223
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,674
Poets are mighty.

224
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,478
Mighty!

225
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,785
Look, got any poems
you've written?

226
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,794
No.

227
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,394
You're no help in my life!

228
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,100
Go back to your book.

229
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,206
I am your Aspirin.

230
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,615
Here.

231
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,614
Fair?

232
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,930
Look here.
What's this?

233
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,530
Why don't I get sausage too?

234
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,228
You know what?

235
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,135
You'd find food
on a dirt gravel road!

236
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,538
Jong-hyun!

237
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,291
You are beautiful.

238
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,891
Stop looking at the book.
Look at me.

239
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,294
Don't give me the cold shoulder.

240
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,097
Look at me.

241
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,006
Jerk!

242
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,801
Man, she called you a jerk.

243
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,706
That I am!

244
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,216
Mi-ryung, I know your brother.

245
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,515
He asked me to protect you
from punks.

246
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,626
I know you don't like me

247
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,127
but I like you.
I like you a lot.

248
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,531
I'm crazy about you.

249
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:45,269
When I want something
I dash like a bulldozer.

250
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,136
Show me what you got.

251
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,240
Damn, it's always Kimchi!

252
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,872
You?

253
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:01,251
- I got Beef!
- Ah, this ass...

254
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,978
You're a smart ass.

255
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,181
It's impossible to hate you.
Let's eat.

256
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,696
KIM Jong-hyun!

257
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,000
Keep stuffing yourselves
like pigs.

258
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,118
You know Mi-ryung
from HyangDo Girl's High?

259
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,017
Yeah.

260
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,116
So what?

261
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,728
She's my squeeze.

262
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,630
- And?
- Let's get it on.

263
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:55,138
Pick someone else.
I'm busy eating.

264
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,036
Come on, asshole.

265
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,573
The winner takes her!

266
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,682
- You know what this is?
- What?

267
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,385
I fought off tears getting it.

268
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,996
With the thought of her!

269
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,890
Still not giving up on her?

270
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,803
You live outside your head
don't you?

271
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,096
You asshole!

272
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,506
On this duel
I'm betting everything.

273
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,009
Is that so?

274
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,004
She's yours then.
Okay?

275
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,813
Can't you be more serious?

276
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,720
A duel is no joke, asshole.

277
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,016
Take off your pants.

278
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,122
- They might rip open, freak.
- That's my style!

279
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,428
Asshole!

280
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,683
Fuck!

281
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,286
Fucking tight pants!

282
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,691
Who you calling asshole!

283
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,899
- Ah, fucker!
- You asshole!

284
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,408
Son of a bitch!

285
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,421
Fuck! What'd you say?

286
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,160
Get the fuck off me!

287
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,073
Get the fuck off me!

288
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,475
Off me, son of a bitch!

289
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,147
Both of you should be fucked!

290
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,583
- You fucking asshole!
- Let go!

291
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,883
Fucker!

292
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,992
Son of a bitch!

293
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,097
Who told you to butt in?

294
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,398
What are you looking at?

295
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,001
The show's over!

296
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,007
Go!

297
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,807
Get out of here!

298
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,649
Fuck!

299
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,055
Get up.

300
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,165
Do you know
what they're called?

301
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,766
Jong-hyun, tell her.

302
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,208
Brave...

303
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,680
...Brothers.
- That's no compliment!

304
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,815
- Sir!
- You bastard!

305
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,783
You almost...

306
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,688
- killed my son!
- Calm down...

307
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,396
A punk like you should
rot in jail!

308
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,090
Calm down, sir.

309
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,294
How could I?

310
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,598
They beat up my son!

311
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,007
- Sit here.
- Excuse me.

312
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,007
- Who are you?
- I'm their mother.

313
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,541
How'd you teach your sons?

314
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,652
- To be bullies?
- I'm sorry.

315
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,953
But this is too much.

316
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,557
You're over-reacting to a kids' fight.

317
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,858
I can't believe this lady!

318
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,164
Is that how you raise
your kids?

319
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,976
I'm not talking to you.

320
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,976
Bring their father.

321
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:34,975
No words are necessary.
He's paying the hospital bill.

322
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,483
They...

323
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,489
They don't have one.

324
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,822
So they took after you.

325
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,592
He ran out on you, huh?

326
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,396
- What the...
- Stop it!

327
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,903
We're responsible.

328
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,134
Not our mother!

329
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,339
Say one more word,
and you'll be sorry.

330
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,938
- You son of a...
- Calm down, sir!

331
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,223
Get your act together!

332
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,564
Though he might be a jerk,
he's still your senior.

333
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,032
I'm sorry.

334
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,041
Give me your account number.

335
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Mom!

336
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,144
I'm sorry.

337
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,052
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,455
I'm sorry. I'M SORRY!

339
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,411
Sung-hyun, Jong-hyun.
Hear me out.

340
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,620
Next time...

341
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,628
when anybody bothers one of you,
you beat him together.

342
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,231
That's what brothers are for.
Understood?

343
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,001
What for?
You're gonna ride that?

344
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,997
You two ride this to school
from now on.

345
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:11,499
You go to school
and come home together.

346
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,803
Understood?

347
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,812
Always together!

348
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,122
What are you doing?

349
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,227
Get the hell off.

350
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,636
Sung-hyun! This is good.

351
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,138
This is like a literature work,
not a letter of apology.

352
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,286
- Jong-hyun.
- Sir.

353
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,093
Reflection!

354
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:08,188
You helped me...
to see the light in the darkness.

355
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,062
I hereby pledge my loyalty to you.

356
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,601
That's right.

357
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,305
Jong-hyun! Come here.

358
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:26,308
What are you, a soldier?
Go clean the bathroom!

359
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,114
And be nice to your mother.

360
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,022
Harelip!

361
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,322
Where's your bodyguard?

362
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,331
Bodyguard my butt.
More like a master!

363
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,933
Hey, Torn Lips.

364
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,930
See if teachers are coming.

365
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,846
What the... Hey!

366
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,378
- Are you nuts?
- What are you doing?

367
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,680
Mopping.

368
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,084
- You're asking for it!
- Hey, Hey, relax

369
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,487
Nothing returns by beating him up

370
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,654
Keep mopping, asshole.

371
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,523
As you are!

372
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,496
Look here, shitheads.

373
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,797
Lose the cigarettes.

374
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,107
Those cancer sticks will do nothing...

375
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,609
but kill you.

376
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,414
What'd you call him?

377
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,416
I'm sorry.

378
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,515
Words won't do it.

379
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,827
- It's okay.
- You stay out of this.

380
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,230
Jong-hyun.

381
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,469
Give me cigarettes.
Give them here.

382
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,480
Hurry!

383
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,915
School is where you study
not smoke you assholes.

384
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,794
Think about...
the future of our nation, assholes!

385
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,700
Out. Get out!

386
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,307
Get the hell out!

387
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,302
Get your asses out of here!

388
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,430
What are you looking at?

389
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,054
Damn, I'm getting dizzy.

390
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,284
Let's take a break.

391
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,300
Aren't you getting
another surgery soon?

392
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,607
No idea.

393
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,713
Can I ask you something?

394
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:53,317
Aren't you upset
you were born as a harelip?

395
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,357
Were you born
because you wanted to?

396
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,163
You got me there.

397
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,663
I just...
I just don't think about it.

398
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,069
It's not life-threatening.

399
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,174
I read in a book

400
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:23,977
that everything happens
for a reason.

401
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:32,888
I'm sure there's a reason...
why I was born like this.

402
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,803
Who wrote that book?

403
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,699
I did.

404
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,313
Shit, I'm getting dizzy again.

405
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,960
Wow, it's awesome.

406
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,163
You can never see this
from down below.

407
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,271
You okay?

408
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,784
- There it goes.
- What?

409
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:57,345
Du-sik is retarded!
Du-sik is retarded!

410
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,441
C'mon... C'mon!

411
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,350
C'mon! C'mon!

412
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,059
Let's go.

413
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,068
Hey, KIM Jong-hyun!

414
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:45,995
Would you mind?

415
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,798
- Who's he?
- Huh?

416
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,000
My younger brother.

417
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,702
What are you doing here?

418
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:05,443
I heard you fought over me.
Is that true?

419
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,346
No way!

420
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:24,160
A poem recital is coming up.
I want you to come.

421
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,784
Let's see what she wrote.

422
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,934
Waiting doesn't have to lead
to meeting.

423
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,338
God, she's so talented!

424
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,840
Let the heart ache.

425
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:11,573
Let the wind blow your smile away.

426
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:18,953
Days of wandering
for my other half somewhere.

427
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,350
Days of wandering.
I like this part.

428
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,565
She must've wandered a lot.

429
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,761
If i were meant for someone upon birth,
I'd like to meet him now.

430
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,767
What does she want to do
with me?

431
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,279
This is good.
She sure can write.

432
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:50,679
What? Envious?
Don't be, It's a burden.

433
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,391
You focus on studying.
That's what you do best.

434
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,797
Should I try?

435
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,204
Dear Mi-ryung

436
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,507
I'm your bodyguard.
A bodyguard of love.

437
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,305
Call me if you need my help.

438
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,144
I'm at your service 24/7...

439
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,218
So freaking corny!

440
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,820
Forget it!

441
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
Blossoming...

442
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,336
Son of a...

443
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:54,834
Next is 'Four-Leaf Clover'
by KIM Jong-hyun.

444
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,684
'Four-Leaf Clover'
by KIM Jong-hyun.

445
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,091
Don't be so sad

446
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,097
Because you have only
three leaves.

447
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:22,604
If you had four leaves
they would...

448
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,106
They would've picked you
long ago

449
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,911
Don't be sad because nobody...

450
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,718
pays attention to you.

451
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:43,825
My eyes are set on you.

452
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:52,725
Let me be your missing leaf.

453
00:42:54,271 --> 00:43:00,767
Even if nobody sees...
it your way...

454
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:06,672
you're the most beautiful leaf
for my eyes.

455
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,818
Your existence...

456
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,189
...is so special to my heart

457
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:19,892
Knowing you...
I couldn't be luckier.

458
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,004
Firecrackers!

459
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,707
$5 for two!
$10 for five!

460
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,114
Firecrackers!

461
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,517
$5 for two!
$10 for five!

462
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,714
Here...

463
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,519
A poem shouldn't be difficult.

464
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,825
It should be easy
to understand.

465
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:00,168
One that the most ignorant
can grasp.

466
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:07,674
One that makes...
tears roll down on your face...

467
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,177
That's a great poem.

468
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,377
Got that?

469
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,385
Here, It's for you.

470
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,691
It looks exactly like me.

471
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,396
- Did you draw this?
- Huh?

472
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:37,201
Yeah, I did

473
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,614
Lean over.

474
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,866
Wow, It's so nice here.

475
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,529
Let's come back.

476
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,469
Sung-Hyun, Go ahead.

477
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,379
I'll stay a little longer.
Okay?

478
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,495
Say... Mi-ryung!

479
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,396
What?

480
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,898
Ki... ss...

481
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,108
Where did Mom go?

482
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,551
Didn't I ask you a question?

483
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,458
Go cook me noodles

484
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,460
What's going on?

485
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:22,566
- Didn't you hear me?
- You do it.

486
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,568
What?

487
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,876
- What'd you say?
- Cook them yourself!

488
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,078
- Are you putting me down?
- You always put me down!

489
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,883
Want your ass kicked?

490
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,683
- Cook me noodles.
- You do it!

491
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,088
- Cook it
- You do it

492
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,391
- Cook it
- You do it. Asshole!

493
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,691
What?

494
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,665
Are you high on something?

495
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,296
Go cook me noodles.

496
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,840
You do it.

497
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,245
A piece of advice.

498
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,345
Know your place, will you?

499
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,073
Shit!

500
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,863
What... do you wanna be?

501
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,662
Nothing

502
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,863
What about you?

503
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,874
Don't laugh, okay?

504
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:46,274
- An actress.
- That's a long shot.

505
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:51,581
I know this agent in Seoul.

506
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,291
He's been asking me
to come up.

507
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:09,199
Don't get me wrong.
He's just a friend.

508
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,138
Mi-ryung.

509
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,236
I don't think
we're good together.

510
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,809
I came to tell you that.

511
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,013
Jong-hyun?

512
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,917
Let's break up before
I fall head over heels.

513
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,620
What do you mean?

514
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,029
I know.

515
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:43,231
It might not make sense to you.
But it does to me.

516
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,538
Jong-hyun...

517
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,442
We're strangers from now on.

518
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,547
Mi-ryung.

519
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,087
I'm sure you'll make it
as an actress.

520
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,106
Brother!

521
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,076
What are you doing?
Go get her!

522
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,116
Who the hell are you?

523
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,721
Do you know who I am?

524
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,231
Yes

525
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,129
What's your name?

526
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,739
KIM Jong-Hyun.

527
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,541
KIM Jong-Hyun...

528
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,783
I don't like by baby sister
giving me headaches.

529
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,393
I'd like to live in peace.

530
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,998
Know what I mean?

531
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,697
I don't think so.

532
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,405
Damn.

533
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,309
See you again, Jong-hyun.

534
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,010
Excuse me.

535
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,392
Is Jong-hyun home?

536
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,395
Yes

537
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,906
I need to talk to him.
Can you get him for me?

538
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,401
What's it about?

539
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,242
Just get him please.

540
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,714
Anything wrong?

541
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,323
Go get him, will you?

542
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:56,457
Tell him I'm not going anywhere
until I see him.

543
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,777
What do you want?

544
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,178
Is that all you have to say?

545
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,479
I think so.

546
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,880
Tell me...
Do you hate me?

547
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,488
Yes.

548
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,591
But why?
Give me a reason.

549
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,691
I don't need a reason
to hate you.

550
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,498
For the last time...

551
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,806
I wanted to see you.

552
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,307
I'm going to Seoul.

553
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:01,557
Good-bye.

554
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,568
Jong-hyun!

555
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,168
KIM Jong-hyun!

556
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,687
Let's go.

557
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,749
<i>That was the last time I saw her.</i>

558
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,652
<i>Sung-Hyun studied hard</i>

559
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,054
<i>and got into med school
at Seoul National University.</i>

560
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,267
<i>As Mom had wished.</i>

561
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:18,763
<i>After he moved to Seoul...
things have changed.</i>

562
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,778
<i>I'd never realized his space
until he left us.</i>

563
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,378
<i>As you can see, it's new
with a good location.</i>

564
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:39,489
As you can see, it's new
with a good location.

565
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,494
Great for business.

566
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,489
Look at the brochure.

567
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,500
This, the interior will be way better...

568
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,095
once completed.
A masterpiece.

569
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,802
Hey, it's going to the 3rd floor.

570
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,305
Take a look around.

571
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,342
You know what they call you
at the cram school?

572
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,748
Burberry Man!

573
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,150
Don't you have other jackets?

574
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:10,157
Shut up, asshole.
What'd you want?

575
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,858
Neither of us is the academic type.

576
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,463
- Let's make money
- How?

577
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,260
There's a way.

578
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,673
I already talked to my mom.

579
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,276
Her savings account matures
at the month-end.

580
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,371
Let's start a street bar.

581
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,778
That's no money-maker.

582
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,283
You live once.
Try to live with style!

583
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,681
Then again...

584
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:41,382
your soon-to-be doctor brother
will make money for you.

585
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,795
What's the occasion?

586
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,598
Got a problem I'm being nice?

587
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,438
- Mom
- What?

588
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:06,338
- You got some money put aside?
- I paid the down payment today.

589
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,549
You're walking on clouds.

590
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,450
You're not a business type.

591
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,756
Didn't I tell you not to do it?

592
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:24,656
I can't be a moneylender...
once your brother becomes a doctor.

593
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,267
Why don't I start a street bar?

594
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,772
When I have the experience...

595
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,877
we'll open a restaurant like this.

596
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,174
Shut up and keep studying.

597
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,684
You need a college degree
for a doctor brother.

598
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,077
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

599
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,378
Where's everybody?

600
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,681
Don't you know?
The company's gone down.

601
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,313
Mrs. SIM!

602
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,017
Mom!

603
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,025
What's the matter?

604
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,630
Jong-hyun...

605
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:42,329
I think I'm going insane.

606
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,633
What should I do?

607
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:49,033
Why? Anything wrong?

608
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,349
What should I do?

609
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,915
Fuck!

610
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:12,326
- Give us our money back!
- What are you doing?

611
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,031
Give us our money!

612
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:17,630
Asshole!

613
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,032
Son of a bitch!

614
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,644
Give us our money, fuckers!

615
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,544
Assault, property damage...

616
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,744
You have to strike a deal
with the victim.

617
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,854
Or else you are arrested.

618
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,653
What brings you down here?

619
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:39,055
Just wanted to say hi.

620
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,064
Fuck you snob ass!

621
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,462
You shouldn't have done this.

622
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,059
Come on, it isn't much.

623
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,570
Sweat pants...

624
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:55,370
- How's business?
- Great, thanks to you.

625
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,519
- Chief.
- Yes?

626
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,918
- What's he in for?
- You know him?

627
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:13,823
It's me

628
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,528
Be...

629
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,237
nice to Mom.

630
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,934
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

631
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:30,943
Okay?

632
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,947
Be nice to Mom.

633
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,550
Jong-hyun!

634
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,265
Any word from Mi-ryung?

635
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:54,662
No.

636
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:56,769
That bitch.

637
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,003
I'd always wanted
to see you again.

638
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,313
What are you up to?

639
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,216
- I go to cram school
- Cram school?

640
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:15,119
I didn't know you were a nerd.

641
01:03:23,365 --> 01:03:26,823
Drop by anytime.

642
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,045
Still got balls?

643
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,457
Didn't I say I'd call you?

644
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,062
Yeah, wait to hear from me!

645
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,060
I cant believe...
you ordered only for yourself.

646
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:05,497
Isn't he your friend?

647
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,610
You're so senseless.

648
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,504
Keep the window open
when you eat!

649
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,119
It's open.

650
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,929
Sorry to keep you waiting.

651
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,827
This is how I live.

652
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:37,038
I can't trust anybody.

653
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,736
- Young-chun...
- What?

654
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,039
Go ahead.

655
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:52,312
Feel free to talk.
Think of me as your brother.

656
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:54,350
Wanna smoke?

657
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,357
It's nothing.
See you later.

658
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:00,788
Jong-hyun.

659
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:13,401
Tell my mom
you're lending it to her.

660
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,102
Where'd you get this money?

661
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,912
I've been temping.

662
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,725
Why'd you come?

663
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,731
Don't worry.

664
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:44,167
I survived without a husband.
I can do the same without money.

665
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,041
Who knows?

666
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:55,148
May be this is a blessing
in disguise.

667
01:05:55,584 --> 01:06:00,783
That's the spirit.
I'll make money for you.

668
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,601
This is so good.
I haven't had it for a while.

669
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,398
If you had started...

670
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:24,307
I'm worried about you.

671
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:30,011
Look at you.
Don't they let you sleep?

672
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:34,021
Do you eat well?

673
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:40,519
- Eat, Mother.
- I'm okay.

674
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:45,927
Tell me.

675
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,338
Have you opened up a person?

676
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,837
I'm in preparatory course.
Not there yet.

677
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,782
I just asked, okay?

678
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:13,194
Do you have a cold?

679
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,891
Just feeling a bit chilly.

680
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,805
Didn't go to cram school yet?

681
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,298
Where is Sung-hyun?

682
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,505
Beats me.

683
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,118
Where have you been
running around?

684
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:39,914
What's that?

685
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:45,115
This?
Herb medicine for your brother.

686
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,626
Damn!

687
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,625
Are you out of your mind?

688
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:54,433
He needs to stay healthy,
studying so hard.

689
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,935
No words are needed.

690
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,631
So stop it for his and my sake.

691
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,971
My tooth...

692
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,977
Stop worrying about him
and go to a dentist!

693
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,183
My tooth...

694
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,296
Sung-hyun!
How nice to see you!

695
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,398
Long time no see.

696
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,796
You look great man.

697
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,495
What are you doing here?

698
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:31,695
I came to see my folks.
How have you been?

699
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,400
I've started a street bar.

700
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,908
Wish Jong-hyun helped me.

701
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,809
He quit cram school with me
but changed his mind.

702
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,715
What are you talking about?

703
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:52,825
<i>Du-sik's Restaurant
Shit, why here?</i>

704
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,866
Look, lady.

705
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:12,173
If a person walks in,
you say hi.

706
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,383
You consider yourself one?

707
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,685
Watch it, lady.

708
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,790
You borrow and pay back.
Simple as that!

709
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:39,507
- Get out!
- Shit, you scared me.

710
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,699
Get out of here!

711
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,303
- Get out!
- Stop screaming!

712
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,208
I said get out! Get the hell out!

713
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,908
Or we're dying together!

714
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,313
- Get out of here!
- Mom

715
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,420
- Mom
- Du-sik stay out.

716
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:54,317
It's okay.

717
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,917
It's okay, my baby.
Let's go in.

718
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,425
Those bastards!
Punks!

719
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,638
Jong-hyun.

720
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:23,045
What's that?

721
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:25,451
Medicine for your cold.

722
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:26,949
Forget it.

723
01:10:36,598 --> 01:10:38,065
I don't want it!

724
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,974
You go to cram school lately?

725
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,283
I don't, So what?

726
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,519
Aren't you gonna study?

727
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,818
That's your thing.

728
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:07,126
I'll do what I do best.

729
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:13,133
Let's stop it.
Mom might hear us, Let's go in.

730
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,730
I don't care if she does.

731
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,033
She's your only concern.

732
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:21,635
And you're hers.

733
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,937
I've had it, okay?

734
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,343
Stop hanging out with Young-chun.

735
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,949
You know his reputation.

736
01:11:31,286 --> 01:11:33,151
None of your business.

737
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:37,256
- When did you start caring?
- Jong-hyun!

738
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,358
You don't know?
When will you grow up?

739
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:42,861
What do you know?

740
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,058
Whom does she suffer for?

741
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,870
You have no right to say that.

742
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:53,465
So stop preaching
and go back to Seoul!

743
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:07,211
Stop being selfish for a change,
and take her to the dentist.

744
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,825
Where'd you get this?

745
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,225
Let go.

746
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,525
- You don't wanna upset me.
- Where you get it!

747
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,134
- Tell me!
- Get the fuck off me!

748
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,931
How nice is this?

749
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:27,633
Why don't you fight?
Go ahead!

750
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,241
I suffered...

751
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,543
...to raise you alone.
And this is what I get?

752
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:40,048
Gather around the neighbors
and show them a good time!

753
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,151
Is this what happens
without a father?

754
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,657
You're unbelievable.

755
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,765
What should I do with you?

756
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,560
What?

757
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:56,467
- Why only me?
- You don't know?

758
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,903
What are you good for?

759
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,307
You do nothing but fight...
and embarrass me!

760
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,605
Aren't you use to it?

761
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,615
You make my heart ache!

762
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:10,513
You got scammed, not me.
Don't take it out on me.

763
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:16,386
And don't give me that
I suffered for you shit!

764
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:20,316
Then what?

765
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,024
What have I suffered for?

766
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,528
If not for you, what else?

767
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,035
I never asked you to!

768
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:35,537
You think I was born
because I wanted to?

769
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,638
What'd you push me out for?

770
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,053
Fine...

771
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,658
Fine.

772
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,697
How could...

773
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:07,908
he say that...

774
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:16,306
Du-sik, who's your
favorite friend?

775
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:20,021
- Sung-hyun.
- Is he?

776
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,721
Sing for Mommy.

777
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,325
Yeah.

778
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:34,924
I wish I had never known
your family.

779
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,235
Like mother, like son!

780
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,837
Does it run in the genes
to live as leeches?

781
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,240
- Shut up and bring the money.
- That's no way to live!

782
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:46,643
- - That's no way to live!
- Fuck!

783
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,341
Yeah, go ahead!

784
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,954
Trash the place, for all I care!

785
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,955
Mom stop it, Mom stop.

786
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:00,190
We're going down together!

787
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,097
How could you!
You asshole!

788
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,501
Asshole! Asshole...

789
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,106
- Jong-hyun!
- Son of a bitch!

790
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,510
No!

791
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,409
Du-sik! Du-sik!

792
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,712
That's enough!

793
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,319
Hey enough!

794
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,423
You Barstard! I said enough!

795
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,724
Enough! That's enough!

796
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,729
Stop it! I said stop!

797
01:15:39,267 --> 01:15:40,632
Mom!

798
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:50,639
Stop it! I'll pay you!

799
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,940
- You gonna kill him!
- Fucken asshole!

800
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,448
Hey enough!

801
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,194
Take this and get out!

802
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,196
- Let's go, Come on!
- Get out!

803
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,097
Du-sik... Du-sik...

804
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,000
Du-sik, it's okay!

805
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:22,805
It's okay.

806
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:28,111
Jong-hyun, let's go
Let's go now.

807
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,731
I didn't expect you
to collect it.

808
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,030
Next month, we will build
a new building there.

809
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:51,832
Good job, boys.

810
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:56,544
Young-chun.

811
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,439
What?

812
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,075
I have something to tell you.

813
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,277
I quit.

814
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:09,781
I will pay back what I owe you.

815
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,698
Son of a bitch!

816
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:23,995
Look, asshole.

817
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,712
Are you joking with me?

818
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,908
Are you?

819
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,107
Are you?

820
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:40,316
I'm not joking.

821
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,968
Do I look that easy?

822
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,771
What the fuck are you looking at?

823
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:18,988
You know what?

824
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,890
Jong-hyun took a lot
after your father.

825
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,003
It's all my fault.

826
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:36,104
Raising two sons
without a husband...

827
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:44,214
One was like a husband,
and the other like a son.

828
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,417
Jong-hyun was strong.

829
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,923
But you weren't.

830
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,159
So I paid more attention to you.

831
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:16,476
Hi!

832
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:59,517
They might take pity on you.

833
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:06,420
But as far as I know,
you have it all.

834
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:10,029
What do I have?

835
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,327
You don't know?

836
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,529
Mom!

837
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:21,504
If we were drowning,
who would she save?

838
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,044
You know how to swim
so she wouldn't go for you.

839
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,856
Do you know how much
her panties are?

840
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,553
I do.

841
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:44,961
She buys two for $1
at the market.

842
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,864
Why would she do that?

843
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,503
So she could save up
for my surgeries.

844
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,516
Do you have any idea

845
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:09,512
how I felt looking in the mirror
after the surgeries?

846
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:15,526
I was upset.

847
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:21,734
What's the point?
It doesn't work.

848
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:29,809
Why can't she spend that money
on you and herself?

849
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:38,448
If she had,
I would've lived my way.

850
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:42,246
So I'm sorry.

851
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:48,151
To both you and mother.

852
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:51,060
Forget about me.

853
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,161
Be nice to Mom.

854
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,963
- I'm the skeleton in the closet.
- No way!

855
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:02,499
She said you were like
a husband figure to her.

856
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:08,609
She paid me more attention
because I wasn't perfect.

857
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:18,214
Honestly, we grew up
nibbling her heart away.

858
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,928
If you pour for yourself,
you'll never get married.

859
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:54,554
You okay?

860
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,357
Yeah, I'm fine.

861
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,697
You aren't the only one
who worries about her.

862
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:10,004
I do too in my own way.

863
01:24:11,245 --> 01:24:12,507
I know.

864
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:23,617
Jong-hyun!

865
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:30,419
I have a wish only you can grant.

866
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:33,026
What is it?

867
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:37,134
Call me 'Brother' once.

868
01:24:52,186 --> 01:24:55,849
Put this on.
It's quite chilly.

869
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,588
Just once.

870
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,397
Jong-hyun!

871
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,901
Call me 'Brother' just once.

872
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,905
- What's up so early?
- Going to cram school!

873
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,611
Is this a dream?

874
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:31,418
Don't seed that
Seed something that looks good.

875
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,225
- Mrs. SIM?
- Yeah?

876
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,727
I'm going.

877
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,886
<i>I'll film the most truthful
moments on the camera.</i>

878
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:12,889
<i>My father use to say that to Mom
before their marriage.</i>

879
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:20,199
<i>That day, Sung-hyun took
father's camera out of the closet.</i>

880
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,420
Move!

881
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:42,822
Out of the way!

882
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:47,427
Why take those trays?

883
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,735
Just grab chairs!

884
01:26:57,578 --> 01:26:58,977
You go to SNU?

885
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:01,773
Yes.

886
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,079
Tell Jong-hyun to stay home.

887
01:27:05,419 --> 01:27:07,182
He doesn't wanna be
seen outside.

888
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:16,495
I packed some side dishes
that you like.

889
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,292
Share them with your friends.

890
01:27:18,432 --> 01:27:22,892
And don't skip your
herb medicine.

891
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,698
- Do it tomorrow.
- Didn't you say...

892
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:29,901
You're taking the first train?

893
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:32,911
Why'd you buy these?

894
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:36,316
Ah, Ah...

895
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,217
Hurts... Ah...

896
01:27:39,353 --> 01:27:42,220
Guess I'm getting old.

897
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:45,018
Parts begin to break.

898
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:48,021
Should I go get medicine?

899
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:52,831
- I'll be back in a jiffy.
- I will go.

900
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:55,235
No, I will go.

901
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:56,836
You stay with Mom.

902
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:59,166
You won't see each other
for a while.

903
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:02,872
Chew me up while I'm gone.

904
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:05,570
Come on, Jong-hyun.

905
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,382
I will go.

906
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:11,382
You go, Sung-hyun.

907
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:14,679
What's the occasion?

908
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,985
Happy?
If so, you can show it.

909
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:36,509
What'd you talk about?

910
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,306
Why didn't you call me?

911
01:28:40,047 --> 01:28:42,515
So you could lament about life?

912
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,011
No thanks!

913
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:51,423
You're all grown up now,
leaving me out of your matters?

914
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:55,526
Come on, tell me.
What'd you talk about?

915
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:58,122
- Curious?
- Yes!

916
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,665
- We've decided...
- Yeah?

917
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,870
To marry you off!

918
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:09,567
We'll find a good looking
gentleman for you.

919
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:11,973
Really?

920
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:13,375
- Mom.
- What?

921
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:14,776
Going senile?

922
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,979
It's raining.

923
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,085
Did he bring an umbrella?

924
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,314
Damn, it's pouring.

925
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:01,319
Here it is.

926
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,730
Your mom is so proud of you.

927
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:26,941
Asshole!

928
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:41,057
Do whatever you want.

929
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:54,534
I treated you like a brother
and you go against me?

930
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,515
Calm down, boss

931
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:06,512
Ah...

932
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,025
Asshole.

933
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:33,945
What happened to the balls
you once had?

934
01:32:35,649 --> 01:32:37,617
I won't let you...

935
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,221
play with them.

936
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:14,805
No way.

937
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,808
I'm not scared.

938
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:20,713
Mom...

939
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,124
Du-sik

940
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:34,829
I'm sorry.

941
01:36:47,267 --> 01:36:48,427
Fuck!

942
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:53,334
What... What happened?

943
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:55,935
Jong-hyun...

944
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:59,373
What happened?
Sung-hyun!

945
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:06,482
Anybody here?

946
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,683
Help!

947
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:15,789
Fuck!

948
01:37:15,929 --> 01:37:19,695
Hey! Open your eyes.

949
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:26,499
Sung-hyun!

950
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,503
Open them, Sung-hyun!

951
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:35,606
Hang in there.

952
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,508
Hang in there.

953
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:40,313
Hey!

954
01:37:40,954 --> 01:37:42,114
Let's go.

955
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,220
Get up.

956
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:52,929
Get up, asshole!

957
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:00,166
Sung-hyun!

958
01:38:07,614 --> 01:38:08,774
Come on, get up.

959
01:38:10,717 --> 01:38:12,685
Get the fuck up!

960
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:43,408
I should burn them all.

961
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:47,520
How could...

962
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:51,120
he leave me like this?

963
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:55,820
How! How!

964
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,327
How!

965
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:01,759
How!

966
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,867
How!

967
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:13,675
Yeah, burn them all!

968
01:39:14,815 --> 01:39:17,375
Or pull yourself together!

969
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:30,289
Sung-hyun!

970
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:32,691
Sung-hyun!

971
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,072
My poor baby...

972
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:22,539
Hello?

973
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:27,146
Anybody home?

974
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,451
Hello?

975
01:40:34,027 --> 01:40:35,790
Anybody home?

976
01:40:42,402 --> 01:40:43,869
These are for you.

977
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:55,206
<i>Happy Birthday, Mother.
It's me Sung-hyun.</i>

978
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:58,638
<i>I'm sorry I can't be with you</i>

979
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:01,805
<i>Being away from home,
memories come back.</i>

980
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:03,711
<i>Do you remember?</i>

981
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:08,315
<i>Jong-hyun and I would make
seaweed soup for your birthday.</i>

982
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:12,623
<i>We'd make so much
we ate it for a whole week.</i>

983
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:21,729
<i>If God sent you us because
he had his hands full</i>

984
01:42:21,868 --> 01:42:25,634
<i>you got yourself
two most troublesome sons.</i>

985
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:30,632
<i>We basically confiscated your life.</i>

986
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:33,637
<i>But you know what they say?</i>

987
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,544
<i>Troubled ones pay back later.</i>

988
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:38,546
<i>I'll be a good son.</i>

989
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:43,147
<i>If not, Jong-hyun
won't let me get away.</i>

990
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:48,156
<i>How's Jong-hyun?</i>

991
01:42:48,995 --> 01:42:52,158
<i>I miss him.
You know what?</i>

992
01:42:52,999 --> 01:42:55,763
<i>I think I owe him a lot</i>

993
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:58,997
<i>because you always put me
before him.</i>

994
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:07,204
<i>Mother, stop worrying about me
and be nicer to him.</i>

995
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:11,105
<i>He's the one beside you now.</i>

996
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:15,918
<i>Mother...
No, Mom...</i>

997
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:20,124
<i>I always wanted to call you
Mom like Jong-hyun.</i>

998
01:43:21,661 --> 01:43:23,128
<i>I love you.</i>

999
01:43:23,563 --> 01:43:26,930
<i>Be well and happy with us.</i>

1000
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:30,536
<i>I'll always be by your side.</i>

1001
01:43:31,771 --> 01:43:34,433
<i>Lots of love, Sung-hyun.</i>

1002
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:45,747
<i>That day, I saw her cry
for the first time.</i>

1003
01:44:35,168 --> 01:44:36,533
Remember?

1004
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:42,341
We once got up here together.

1005
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:55,052
Then...

1006
01:44:57,490 --> 01:45:00,482
I wanted to tell you something.

1007
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:03,794
You...

1008
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:07,094
You know what?

1009
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,595
What?

1010
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:13,699
Nothing.

1011
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:16,909
It's nothing.

1012
01:45:18,144 --> 01:45:21,204
Damn, so beautiful.

1013
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,117
Say it. What is it?

1014
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:30,719
Aren't you curious...

1015
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,518
what I wanted to say?

1016
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:42,032
Back then...

1017
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:49,239
You spoke so well.

1018
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:55,240
You didn't stammer.

1019
01:45:57,584 --> 01:45:59,176
Not at all.

1020
01:46:05,725 --> 01:46:06,987
You...

1021
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,596
You weren't stammering.

1022
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:17,298
So...

1023
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,503
You didn't have to practice

1024
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:29,114
with the recorder
every night.

1025
01:46:34,954 --> 01:46:36,922
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1026
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,122
Damn.

1027
01:46:45,265 --> 01:46:48,029
Now I can't tell you this.

1028
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:55,837
No matter how much I want to...

1029
01:46:59,212 --> 01:47:01,578
it's impossible now.

1030
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:07,477
I'm sorry, Sung-hyun.

1031
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:12,086
I...

1032
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,994
I was a bad brother.

1033
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:25,102
I...

1034
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:31,602
I'm truly sorry.

1035
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:43,913
I'm sorry.

1036
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1037
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:50,929
There weren't many shots taken.

1038
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:59,971
They're great pictures.

1039
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,168
Who took them?

1040
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:04,474
Did you?

1041
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:12,579
No.

1042
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:15,786
My...

1043
01:48:17,323 --> 01:48:18,585
My 'Brother' did.

1044
01:49:06,906 --> 01:49:08,874
<i>I honestly don't think</i>

1045
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:12,369
<i>I can fill in his space.</i>

1046
01:49:15,014 --> 01:49:17,380
<i>But I will try hard.</i>

1047
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:23,280
<i>That's the least I could do
as his baby brother.</i>

1048
01:49:58,057 --> 01:49:59,718
That's enough.

1049
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,130
