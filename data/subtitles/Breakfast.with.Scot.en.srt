1
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,501
- Leafs are the best!
- Go Maple Leafs!

2
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,133
Go Leafs go!

3
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,133
Yeah, Maple Leafs!

4
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,567
Win the cup!

5
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,234
Yeah!

6
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,234
Welcome contest winners!

7
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,200
Get ready for the Toronto Maple
Leafs blue and white game!

8
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,634
Maple Leafs...

9
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,501
Come on out and meet the kids.

10
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,601
Hey.

11
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,501
- High five, buddy.
- McNally!

12
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,567
McNally! McNally!

13
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,567
You're my hero.

14
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,067
Come on, McNally.

15
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,434
Head in front.
- Come on skate, skate in!

16
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,534
Who's on McNally?!

17
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,767
Keep your eyes open, guys!

18
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,601
It's a practice!

19
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:26,701
McNally, it's a practice.

20
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:46,267
You suck, McNally.
You suck. You suck.

21
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,000
Heads up!

22
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:54,234
McNally, you suck.
You suck, McNally. You suck.

23
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:56,801
McNally you suck...

24
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,868
Will the team keep together
a back line tandem borrowed

25
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:17,334
from the Peterborough Petes
and les Ramparts de Quebec?

26
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,334
And the final question: can the
Canadian Juniors get one for the thumb?

27
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,234
Tomorrow we'll look at the big boys. We'll get
their sticks to center ice and divvy 'em up.

28
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:26,467
We'll give you the Stanley Cup contenders,
the Cup Pretenders and the also-rans.

29
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,601
So whether you like the biscuit upstairs
where grandma keeps the peanut butter

30
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,701
or skate-level where the chips are
thick. Consider us your home rink.

31
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,701
And to all you bruisers with
noses for the corners

32
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,267
remember, you might get hooked and if you
get hooked, you could get a penalty shot.

33
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:41,067
I'm Eric McNally, thanks for watching
this NHL preview edition of penalty shot.

34
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,968
See you in the blues.

35
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:47,033
- Clear.
- Good.

36
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,601
Good job, guys.

37
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,767
- Good job, Eric.
- Yeah. Good job, Eric.

38
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,050
Thanks.

39
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,334
Channel 5 just challenged
us to a pick-up game.

40
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,534
You in?
- Sure.

41
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:08,367
- Only reason I hired you.
- What?

42
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,367
I'm joking.

43
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,067
- Yep, joking.
- Oh.

44
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,467
- Listen, if you wanna get out
from behind that desk,

45
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,167
I'm thinking I'll let you
cover the world juniors.

46
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,500
In Reykjavik?

47
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,834
I'm surprised you know
how to say Reykjavik.

48
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,834
More reason to learn
how to say Reykjavik.

49
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:26,634
- Alright good, we'll pick 5 players
to follow, maybe 6, interview them here.

50
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,634
You know, the heart-warming
stuff with their families.

51
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,934
Grab some B-roll
of them at practice

52
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:34,400
and then we'll fly you out to Iceland
to track 'em for the network there.

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,234
Who's going to Reykjavik? Huh?

54
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,567
Reykjavik!
- In December yeah, here you go.

55
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,801
- Ah, you don't fool me. You
know what? I'll put in a word.

56
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,701
See if they let me take an
assistant, so I might take you.

57
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,701
- Yeah. I wanted
to be put in news.

58
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,701
I wanted to cover politics,
breaking world issues, I mean...

59
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,000
Why am I in sports?
Is it because I'm pretty?

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,901
- All you can do is play hard
for the team that picks you, Nula.

61
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:58,400
- Oh, and there is someone from your
team in your office here to see you.

62
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,767
Hey.

63
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,767
Nice office.

64
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,667
You got a little teen boy
bedroom thing going on.

65
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,968
Everybody does here.

66
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,133
So uh...

67
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,133
You met everybody here?

68
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,033
- Don't worry, this time I was your
lawyer. I mean, I was your lawyer.

69
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,601
Hm.

70
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,601
What's up?

71
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:26,734
- Julie died.
- I'm sorry.

72
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:30,000
Who's Julie?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,300
- She's that girl that my
brother Billy was living with

74
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,067
until a couple years ago.
- Ah.

75
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,067
- We can't find Billy and
there's a chance that he's--

76
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,634
- An asshole?
- No, we know he's an asshole

77
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,100
but...

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,901
What are you doing right now?

79
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,300
He's in Brazil.
Isn't he? Brazil.

80
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
- Probably why
we can't find him.

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,267
- Short of searching the jails and the
alleys, I don't know where else to look.

82
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,334
- Sam and his brother are
not so good at keeping in touch.

83
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,934
- Well we have a problem then seeing
as Billy is Scot's guardian and all.

84
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:07,117
Who's Scot?

85
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,300
Wait! Billy was working
at a resort somewhere.

86
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
Who's Scot?

87
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:11,701
I mean, assuming he's
managed to keep the job.

88
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:13,284
Maybe we could track him down that way.

89
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,868
Who's Scot now?

90
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,667
Julie's son.

91
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,801
- Julie's... Julie had a son.
I didn't know that.

92
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,501
And Billy's the dad?
- He's not Scot's dad.

93
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,601
I mean not by birth anyway but--

94
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,434
- According to Julie's
will he is now.

95
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,968
- Billy's not really father
material. He's a loser.

96
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:32,467
I mean, I don't see her giving
him custody of her son.

97
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:35,000
And Billy wouldn't take Scot
unless there's money involved.

98
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,868
- I think there's
money involved.

99
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,334
Proof.

100
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:48,834
This is dated 5 years ago.

101
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,033
- Well, she died of an overdose. I don't
think keeping her personal files updated

102
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:55,167
was upper-most on her mind.
- Where's Scot now?

103
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,834
Child Services Ottawa.

104
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,501
And he's okay there
until we find Billy?

105
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,334
- We feel,
we being Child Services,

106
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,467
it would be better for the ward
to settle into his permanent home.

107
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,100
Or until we can
find Billy, your home.

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,234
What?

109
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:14,200
Congratulations. You're dads.

110
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,400
- Nope.
- It's only for a few weeks.

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,567
No! Kids? You're joking right? No way,
kids, I can't stand the little things.

112
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,567
You knew about this
back in the office.

113
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,267
- I knew it was a possibility.
- Bad call.

114
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:30,400
'Cause boys that age are nightmares.
And boys any age are nightmares.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,434
Two words: night mares. And I should
know, I grew up playing hockey with 'em.

116
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,850
You know, first thing he
does... He sells our TV.

117
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,267
He's not gonna do that.

118
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,434
- He'll sell our TV and then
he'll drain the liquor cabinet.

119
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,634
He'll be a liquor bag, a booze
hound and then he's gonna wreak havoc

120
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:44,300
throughout the entire house Sam. Our house!
That you spent all that time fixing up.

121
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,234
And then, after the booze
and the TV, girls. Girls, Sam.

122
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,934
He's gonna drag some poor
girl up here and deflower her.

123
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,734
Right here in our bed with
your fancy 500 count sheets

124
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,901
which we'll never be able to use
again. What if he forms a gang?

125
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,133
What if he has a bad haircut?
- Didn't stop you.

126
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,400
- Stop.
- Breathe.

127
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,467
Our TV isn't going anywhere and I'm
pretty sure nobody gets deflowered anymore.

128
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,867
Look, we have to do this.
It's the right thing to do.

129
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,267
No look,

130
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:11,501
We don't have to do anything. I've spent
the last 5 years building my life back up,

131
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,901
doctors, physio, to where
I finally like my life again.

132
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,267
I don't want my life to change.
Trust me.

133
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,133
Life as you know it is not gonna change.

134
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,000
Ryan!

135
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,601
Ryan!

136
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:27,000
Drop the damn stick!

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Give it to me to beat you with.

138
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:37,400
- It's only for
a few weeks.

139
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,834
Mildred.

140
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,200
- Sam asked me
to make up Scot's room.

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,300
- They're not coming home 'til
late. I have time. Thanks.

142
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,701
- After George died, you shovelled
my sidewalk, you mowed my lawn.

143
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,100
Christ, 2 months ago you cut
down the tree in my backyard.

144
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,566
Right but I didn't do those
things so you would make a bed.

145
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,033
I can make a bed but thank you.

146
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,334
- And that's all
you're doing?

147
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:15,567
- Ah, I'll throw in a
couple towels and face...

148
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,367
Things.

149
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,968
Oh, you remember my son?

150
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,234
- Yes, George Junior.
We were at his wedding.

151
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:26,133
- He's divorced now.
Wasn't that quick?

152
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,834
Where's his room?
Upstairs?

153
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,334
This is where
you're putting him?!

154
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,334
- Alright George,
I'll see...

155
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,434
The boys mother just died

156
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:53,067
and in that fragile emotional state
you're gonna throw him on that?

157
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,601
- Yeah, it's a mattress.
It's a bed. It's a air bed.

158
00:09:55,601 --> 00:10:00,033
- What we're gonna need: a real bed
with a real bookcase and a real desk.

159
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,467
Yeah. Posters, pictures...

160
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,901
- What's wrong with-- 
- George.

161
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,400
You think this junk's gonna fit
in your father's old study?

162
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,534
- No, let me stop you right
there, Mildred, okay.

163
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:10,234
This is not, okay, this is
not junk, I mean, I--

164
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,051
You have a gym membership somewhere?

165
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,868
I have three. Why?

166
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,868
Mildred. Mildred!

167
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:23,767
No. Mildred.

168
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,767
Mildred.

169
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,968
<i>- Toronto picks up
the puck sending it down...</i>

170
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>Still looking for an opening.</i>

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,801
<i>Puck passed up the zone
and it goes back into the--</i>

172
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,801
Eric, we're here.

173
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,934
I... Oh, uh...
We just made it.

174
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,100
Scot, this is Eric.

175
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,634
- Nice to meet
you, Scot.

176
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:07,100
- Nice to meet
you, Eric.

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,667
It's hand cream.

178
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:13,400
- It's called Pink Gardenia.
I have the bath splash too.

179
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,534
Yeah, it was his mother's.

180
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,801
- Oh, was it?
Was it your mom's? That's...

181
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,834
What is that?
- It's a charm bracelet.

182
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,467
- Again, Julie's.
- Right.

183
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,534
What are you... Would you like
a... You must be hungry.

184
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,734
Do you want something
to eat in the kitchen?

185
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,000
We have... I'll make
you a turkey sandwich or...

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,601
Peanut butter. Kids like
peanut butter. Or pop!

187
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,334
Do want a pop? Do you want
a root beer, a Pepsi?

188
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:43,801
Ginger ale? Mountaindew?
Uh, juice! Juice?

189
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,434
We have uh, would you like to...
We have some pear juice.

190
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,868
It's kind of a fancy pear juice
that Sam brings into the...

191
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:53,434
The... I'm watching the Leafs.
Maybe, you wanna watch hockey?

192
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:57,234
I only like musicals.

193
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,968
- Okay, Scot, why don't
I take you upstairs?

194
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:03,100
- Yeah, that's great. Yeah, take him
upstairs. Show him his new bedroom.

195
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,501
New bedroom?

196
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,834
You know what? Wait one second
while I uh... Scot.

197
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,434
Wow!

198
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,534
Wow!

199
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,968
I uh... I haven't seen your room
since Eric fixed it up for ya.

200
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:23,801
- What do you think?
- Who's that?

201
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:28,801
- Wayne Gretzky.
- Who's that?

202
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:32,033
Wayne Gretzky.

203
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:36,000
I'd like to go to bed now.

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,234
- Okay, you don't need anything from
your um, from your bags downstairs?

205
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:43,434
- No, I think I have all my
necessary toiletries in here.

206
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:45,434
Okay.

207
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, bathroom is downstairs
on the second floor

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,267
and we're just opposite
if you need anything.

209
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,267
- Sam?
- Yeah.

210
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,267
- How long do you think
I'm going to be here for?

211
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:58,300
- I called Billy.
I left a message.

212
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,200
And I think by the time
he flies up here, maybe...

213
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Couple of weeks.

214
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,634
Well, I guess...

215
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,634
Goodnight.

216
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,834
- What's gardenia?
- It's a kind of flower.

217
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,901
- What's he doing
with hand cream?

218
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:34,267
- # It's the most
wonderful time of the year #

219
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:37,767
# With kids jingle-belling
and everyone yelling #

220
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,100
# To be of good cheer #

221
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,868
# It's the most wonderful time #

222
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,167
# Of the year #

223
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:51,000
- You know, Child Services had him
sitting by himself in a hallway.

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,033
Didn't remember me.

225
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,634
It's no surprise. I think
he was 7 last time I saw him.

226
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,601
Everything he owns is
in those trash bags.

227
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,133
Clothes are dirty.

228
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,033
Nobody washed 'em.
- Well, so you can do that.

229
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,950
Wash clothes.

230
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,868
He doesn't have
gloves or a proper coat.

231
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,200
So you go shopping.

232
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,234
- He's missed a month of school.
- You can enrol him tomorrow.

233
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,234
While you're at it book an
orthodontist appointment for...

234
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:17,167
Look Sammy, you want to
be worried about anything,

235
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,567
worry that the kid's upstairs
singing Christmas carols.

236
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,267
In October,
to himself, by himself.

237
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,934
- Nobody told him
how his mother died.

238
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,767
- You could chance I'm staying
away from that topic too.

239
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,467
How's he think his mother died?

240
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,534
- Child Services told him
she died in a car accident.

241
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:42,267
Well look Sammy...

242
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:45,167
That's Billy's problem. Not
your problem, Billy's problem.

243
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,934
- So he didn't call?
- He didn't call.

244
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,367
- Thank you.
- For what?

245
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:59,734
- For Scot's room.
- Don't thank me. Thank Mildred.

246
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:03,501
And the team of
archaeologist that unearthed it.

247
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:14,834
- # It's the hap-happiest
season of all #

248
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,834
# With those holiday greetings #

249
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,234
# And gay happy meetings #

250
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,267
# When friends come to call #

251
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:26,000
# It's the most
wonderful season of all #

252
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,801
Hi. What are you doing?

253
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,767
- Hey Ryan, calm down.
- Let me go!

254
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,968
- What's going on?
- Uh Eric, a little help here.

255
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,000
- Yeah that's right. Call your
other faggot, faggot.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,801
- He was going to kill me!
- Give me my car lock!

257
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:10,267
- Eric, violent child over here.
- That's it.

258
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,400
- Let me go! Put me down.
- You forgot to say faggot.

259
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,601
- Alls I was doing was hitting
apples with the car lock.

260
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,100
He's the one that came out talking
weird. "What are you doing?"

261
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,267
Hitting apples.
"Why are you doing that?"

262
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:28,300
Cause there's nothing to do.
"Why don't you eat them?"

263
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,968
Who eats apples?! And then he
said he wanted to kiss me.

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,834
Kiss you?

265
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,067
- You think I'd
make this shit up?

266
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,734
<i>- All I said is I
could kiss him.</i>

267
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,067
- To a kid holding a car lock
that's well thought out.

268
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,067
- Hey, Scot come back.
Eat your cereal.

269
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,234
- That is not
a proper breakfast.

270
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,300
- Should I go after him?
- My dad used to just yell.

271
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,501
- Get back here!
You have to eat something!

272
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,400
I am going to need a
helmet and chest thingies

273
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,467
and pads like the roller-bladers wear.

274
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,334
- Wait, wait, wait. Pads?!
Wait a minute. What for?

275
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,434
For protection.

276
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,701
- For starters, how about not telling kids with
iron clubs you could kiss 'em. How 'bout that?

277
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:10,667
Heads up!

278
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,667
You threw pudding?

279
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,667
- Yes! Pudding!
Kids like pudding.

280
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,701
You can make friends with
other kids by uh, you know,

281
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,701
bargaining with them.
No, sharing with them.

282
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:22,367
- Pudding?
- Okay, not pudding. Uh...

283
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:26,701
Pop-Tarts, cheese
sticks, Yogos, Oh...

284
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,534
How 'bout these juices with
pictures of dinosaurs on them?

285
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,367
You know, does he even have a
baseball glove or baseball or...

286
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,133
- No. No.
- Football cleats?

287
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,400
- Maybe on
his charm bracelet.

288
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,934
- So, you'd say you're
the primary guardian?

289
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,767
We also require
a secondary contact.

290
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,901
- Oh but you'll call
me first right? Right?

291
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,534
Head got chopped off.

292
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:10,234
- Eric McNally.
- Oh, and he is your...?

293
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,100
- Can we just
put his name down?

294
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,667
- Huh? Yeah.
Eric...

295
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,767
- She asked me how my mom died, I
told her there was a car accident.

296
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:28,434
- And now she
has no head.

297
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:35,634
- Okay class, today we're saying
hello to a new friend:

298
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:39,567
Scot Latour.

299
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:43,167
- There's only one T. Everything
kind of stops after that.

300
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,467
Oh, that's neat, okay.

301
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,868
Good, one T. There we go.

302
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:51,601
Well, that's a very interesting
spelling, Scot.

303
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,968
- But you should know,
my last name...

304
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,968
You spelt that very well.

305
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:01,868
Thank you, Scot.

306
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,367
- The dying dog tried to stand
but he could only raise his head.

307
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,868
As his trusty friend licked
his hand one last time,

308
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:12,767
the poor trapper whispered:
good buddy, good dog

309
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:17,133
and then the noble animal
lay still. He was gone.

310
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,801
- Nicely done, Carla.
Good okay, Scot.

311
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,267
The other dogs...

312
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,901
Didn't understand...

313
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,334
What had happened to...

314
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:44,801
Their buddy. They gently nudged
his still... Sweet face.

315
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:47,501
There was no sign of...

316
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:54,200
- Class, that's enough.
Come on now, class.

317
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,834
Class!

318
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,868
There you go.

319
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:01,200
All done.
- Thanks Claudia.

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,634
- You're welcome.
- Smell that.

321
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:07,501
Oh, okay,
that's not acceptable.

322
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:12,033
- It's Pink Gardenia.
It's a hand cream.

323
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,100
Scot, the kid, he was wearing it
last night when he shook my hand.

324
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:14,167
Now it won't come off.

325
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,167
Two showers it
won't come off.

326
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,267
- So, who is
this kid again?

327
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:20,834
- Sam's brother's dead
ex-girlfriend's son.

328
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,717
Who's my interview again?

329
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,601
Joe Sakic, about the game last night.

330
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,634
- Sakic,
that bastard.

331
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:29,801
I didn't even see the second game.
Barely watched to the end of the first.

332
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,667
- Alright, record all
hockey games for Eric.

333
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,701
Don't worry, it's gonna
do for all dads here.

334
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,701
- I'm not a dad.
- Okay mommy.

335
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,534
Sam's nice. He should
come around here more.

336
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,834
- Can we not talk about
Sam, thank you very much.

337
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,117
Then how am I supposed
to tell you that he called?

338
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,400
What?

339
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,968
- I was expecting to see your...
Your Sam.

340
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,500
I'll be here tomorrow.

341
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,033
Well you might want to warn your...

342
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:58,534
Your Sam that the first day
might've been too much for Scot.

343
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,184
That's normal though right?

344
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,834
It's normal to be a little
overwhelmed isn't it?

345
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,434
- No, I know overwhelmed. This
is a little bit beyond that.

346
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,567
What's he doing?

347
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,601
- Mumbling.
Or he was a minute ago.

348
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,601
- He still won't
stand up though.

349
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,200
Hi, I'm
Joey Morita!

350
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,000
I am captain
of the safety patrol.

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,901
You'd know I was on a safety patrol if I
was wearing my safety patrol orange belt.

352
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:32,267
But we haven't got those in yet.
- They're on order Joey.

353
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,934
- It creates
confusion Ms Patterson.

354
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:37,100
- Don't sass me
in front of parents.

355
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,033
- No, I'm not a parent and
we're leaving. Scot, stand up.

356
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:46,434
Stand up Scot.

357
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,767
Scot, stand up.

358
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,200
- Sir? I think you're gonna have
to carry him by his poodle belt.

359
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,133
His...

360
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,634
- I'm dropping out
as soon as I can.

361
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:05,200
- That's nice.
Scot put your seatbelt on.

362
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:11,000
Scot, put your seat...
Put your seatbelt on Scot.

363
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,567
Scot we...

364
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,868
My assistant Nula gave me a
present to give to you Scot,

365
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,901
which you can open
if you would just...

366
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,567
- Oh! Stickers!
- Put on your seatbelt.

367
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,300
- I wanna be
Scot's friends sir.

368
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,300
- You'll see him tomorrow.
- It was a pleasure meeting you.

369
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:34,167
- These are the people
in my life now?

370
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:37,234
Nobody told me not to!

371
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,267
I can't be available all the time.
The arbitration comes up at random.

372
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,367
- I know. I know.
- It's gonna happen.

373
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,434
Which would be fine Sam if I hadn't mucked
my way through this interview. I'm the new--

374
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:46,801
- You said I could
decorate however!

375
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,367
Well, we're in this together.

376
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,934
- He, no. No we're not.
- I hate it here!

377
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:55,501
- Well puppy dogs stickers don't
go on freshly painted antique doors!

378
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:00,167
Sam...

379
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:03,667
Billy's brother. Sam,
okay, that's all I'm saying.

380
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,667
Billy's your brother not
mine. And what did you say?

381
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:09,167
You said my life would not
change. That's what you said, okay.

382
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,868
I didn't want the kid
here in the first place.

383
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,968
Oh, long distance.

384
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:25,234
Hello?

385
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:29,467
Little Scoot. Ola.

386
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,234
<i>I'm in Rio. Que tal Buddy.</i>

387
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,534
What?

388
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:37,534
In South America. I moved here
after me and your mom...

389
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:43,067
Shit. I'm sorry but I wasn't
gonna mention your mom.

390
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,601
Shit. I wasn't gonna say shit.
What the fuck?

391
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:49,100
When are you coming to get me?

392
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,400
- Yeah, listen. That's
why I called you bud.

393
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,234
So soon? Maybe tomorrow?
The day after? When?

394
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,584
Listen Scoot, I just wanted to tell
you that like your mom's not really gone.

395
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:58,934
You know? Um...

396
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:02,400
'Cause you know we're all interconnected
in the grand cosmic sense of...

397
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,834
Hang on one second.
May I help you?

398
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:08,901
No, thanks I'm just looking.

399
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,300
Okay. Um...

400
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,100
So how was the funeral? Hello?

401
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,616
Hello?

402
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,200
Nicely done Billy.
Will you go after him?

403
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,133
What Sammy?
What are you doing?

404
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:29,634
I'm talking to Scot.

405
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:48,667
- I don't know what
Billy... Billy is a...

406
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,934
He's in...

407
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:58,334
Listen, the other stuff... Sam
yelling about the stickers...

408
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,701
See he likes
things a certain way.

409
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,834
No clothes on the bathroom floor
or the bedroom floor.

410
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,834
No clothes on the... On the...

411
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,968
Is that a picture of your mom?

412
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll take it down.

413
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, no. Leave it up.

414
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,801
Good, well you probably
have some homework.

415
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,734
I already did it.

416
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,984
Eric?

417
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:32,267
- Yeah.
- Can we go shopping?

418
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,767
- No, I don't...
I don't do shopping.

419
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:42,868
I don't have to... I mean, I get my
clothes at work. Sam buys everything else.

420
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,701
Groceries, everything.
Sam's a shopper.

421
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,267
- I'll stay here then.
- Okay, good.

422
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,667
Good choice.

423
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:02,133
# Hark the herald
angels sing #

424
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,534
# Glory to the newborn king #

425
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,601
# Peace on Earth and-- #

426
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:10,067
- Sam says you need a new coat but
we gotta be back in an hour alright?

427
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:20,834
- I'm going to look for shoes okay?!
- When's Billy coming?

428
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,834
He almost wasn't.

429
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:26,667
He wanted to dump Scot back at Child Services
until I told him about the insurance money.

430
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,067
- Uh-huh, and now?
- He's warming to the idea.

431
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:32,234
He's probably out spending the
insurance money as we speak.

432
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,834
- How big of him.
- How goes the coat search?

433
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,067
I don't know. Ask Boy George.

434
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,601
Call you back.

435
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,601
Scot!

436
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,234
- And now when people come to claim their
things, they'll know you took good care of them.

437
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:04,334
- What are you?
- Hey Eric!

438
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,534
Where have you been? We've been looking
all over for you. Don't run away like that.

439
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,701
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,934
- I'm so sorry.
- What'd he do?

441
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,968
Nothing. About your wife.

442
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:14,801
My wife?

443
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,634
To die in a car accident
in such a horrible way.

444
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,934
No, no I'm not his dad.

445
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,100
He's Eric. He's gay.

446
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,300
I'm n... I'm not. No I'm a...

447
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,100
Him and Sam are married.

448
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,968
- We're not even.
We're not even married.

449
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,534
- They're just gay together.
- You know what actually?

450
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:34,767
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go,
thank you very much. Thanks for all your...

451
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:41,167
Time.

452
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,434
Tell me your mother taught
you never to talk to strangers.

453
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:43,701
I didn't.

454
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,701
- You told the security guards
your life story, then you told

455
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,701
the security guards my life
story. Unbelievable!

456
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:51,133
- He asked me where my mother was and if
there was a number he can call to find her.

457
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,133
- Okay, look I
don't want you...

458
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:56,534
Are you?
Oh don't do that. Don't cry.

459
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,400
Look, I just don't want you telling
people about... My private life is private.

460
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,434
I work in sports, okay,
and some of the guys I talk to

461
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,968
wouldn't be so quick to talk to
me if they knew that I was a...

462
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:07,868
That I'm a... Yeah,
I'm glad we had this talk.

463
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:10,567
Will you just pick something
out? We can get outta here.

464
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,383
Everything's named
after a sports team.

465
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,200
My God.

466
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,601
- Or made out of vinyl
- Come with me.

467
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,667
No. No...

468
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,534
What is that?

469
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,667
What about this one?

470
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,000
- Don't you find it
a little plain?

471
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,567
- Will you please just try it on?
- Fine.

472
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,033
But I'm telling you, if I don't
like this one I am definitely...

473
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:46,200
Oh, Eric! Look at how it hangs!

474
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
- Who's in charge
of the sissy?

475
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,300
- Did you just call me a sissy?
- You're Eric McNally.

476
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,067
You played for the Leafs. You were a great
fighter 'til you got injured in that practice.

477
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,400
Now you're on TV, so...

478
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
- I'm still
a decent fighter.

479
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,267
When you're out in public,
watch the twirling okay?

480
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:32,801
Will you please
just pick a frame?

481
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,901
Ooooh!

482
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,767
- Hey your
sister called.

483
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:56,300
She wants to know
if we can go out Friday.

484
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,133
- That'd be a no.
As a matter of fact...

485
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:02,267
I'll never be leaving
this house again.

486
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,801
- The mall was that traumatic?
- Not the mall.

487
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:08,300
- Which one do you think goes
better with my coat?

488
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,534
This one? Or this one?

489
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,000
Morning Eric.

490
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,400
Holy crap.

491
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,334
- It's a T, like the one
off the end of my name.

492
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:35,968
Have a pancake.

493
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:38,000
- I used to make them
for my mom that way.

494
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,501
If you want
I can pour your syrup.

495
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,567
- No thanks.
I'm good. I'm good.

496
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,367
Hi Carla!

497
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,167
- Hi Scot.
- Shhhh...

498
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,167
- Hi Scot.
- Hi Joey.

499
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,167
I'm here for library class.

500
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,501
- You're kind of late
for library class.

501
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:00,167
As student librarian
it's my duty to tell you that.

502
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:03,300
- Do you have any books on
Brazil? Maybe for someone

503
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,601
who's going to live there.
- Like maybe you?

504
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:07,534
Maybe.

505
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,300
Probably,
I don't know.

506
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,934
- I really like your coat, Scot.
- Yeah, me too.

507
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,767
- Everything I'm
wearing's brand new!

508
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,334
- You know how some people say
gay people shouldn't adopt?

509
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,534
You know that we're recruiting.
- Are you?

510
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:29,934
'Cause I'd have to tell
those people if you were.

511
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,067
- Ah-ha-ha.
You see I'm...

512
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:36,133
I'm not worried about making Scot
gay, I'm worried about him making me...

513
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:39,534
- Eric, you are gay.
Gay, gay, gay...

514
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:41,968
- Yeah, thank you. I know
to my friends and family.

515
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:45,300
Yeah I'm g-etting
older I just...

516
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
# Getting older #
Ha!

517
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,767
Aren't we all? Those people don't
know what it's like to play pro.

518
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,417
You know, the achey back
and the achey cheeks--

519
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,067
Hey Greg.

520
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,400
How you doing?

521
00:32:57,401 --> 00:32:59,734
Eric, how are those
interviews coming along?

522
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,501
- Great. Just
great. Yeah.

523
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:06,934
Start next week with
Corey Flannery. Hot. Hot.

524
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,434
Start?

525
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hi! Can I take your coat?

526
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,267
Well, you must be Scot.

527
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,901
Hello Sam!
- Hello!

528
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,734
And that is your uncle Eric.

529
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:30,267
Do you remember your uncle Eric?
- No.

530
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,100
- Can I offer
you a drink Joan?

531
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,700
Um-hm.

532
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:39,300
- The glasses are frosted.
- Scot's a better host than I.

533
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,968
You don't know the half of it. Why don't
you take Hank upstairs and show him your room?

534
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,801
Doesn't Sam need
help with the pouring?

535
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,634
Now, upstairs.

536
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,367
Please.

537
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:57,067
As far as we know the kid's big on hand cream,
Christmas carols, stickers on antique doors,

538
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,267
that his mother taught him how
to make alphabet pancakes...

539
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,117
Monsieur.

540
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:02,968
But not so much about
being a boy. He's been running

541
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:06,634
around here like it's a Halloween parade.
What's he gonna wanna be for Halloween?

542
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:11,267
- Wow. You sound like a parent.
- Don't. Don't say that.

543
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,117
Don't say that.

544
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,968
Parents bore people by
talking about their children.

545
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,767
Sorry.

546
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,567
And then apologize for it afterwards.

547
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:23,334
- You think you're so smart.
- Fear not gentlemen...

548
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:27,000
I have more at home.

549
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,367
The Wonder of Boys.

550
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,734
- The book we
should've given dad.

551
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,834
One, two, three!

552
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:38,367
# Oh my gosh
I think I need a manicure #

553
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,367
# The sun I swear #

554
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,834
# It's bushing out
my girly hair #

555
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,467
# One two three four #

556
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:48,033
# I don't know what
you ignore not me #

557
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:50,434
# Go Mad Dogs! #

558
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Holy shit.

559
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,868
- We were trying to do the jump
splits. It's really hard.

560
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:01,267
- No, no, no. Take all that stuff...
Take the, whatever that is...

561
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,267
Take all that stuff off, Scot.
- They're just playing, Eric.

562
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,834
- This is an inappropriate game.
Take that, take it off, Scot.

563
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,267
- Maybe Scot could go as a
cheerleader for Halloween.

564
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,834
- Joan do you want your son
parading around like that?

565
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,534
- It'd be too cold.
I don't have leggings.

566
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:15,534
Take that stuff off, Scot.

567
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:18,067
Eric, Scot can dress up
however he wants to dress up

568
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,100
and play whatever game
he wants to play. It's alright.

569
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,583
No, not like this. No.

570
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,067
- Hey!
- Eric!

571
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,367
Really, we were only
trying to do the splits.

572
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,367
Do you want a little tip Scot?

573
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:35,033
Put a pair of washcloths under your
feet next time you're in the bathroom.

574
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:40,133
And then hang onto the counter
'cause you slide down really slowly.

575
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,200
Thanks,
that's a good tip.

576
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,868
Sam dressed me up as a hobo.
I don't wanna be a hobo.

577
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,934
Hobo is easy.
Hobo takes no effort.

578
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:57,934
My mom dresses me up
like a hobo every year.

579
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:04,334
- Ow... You said
this would help.

580
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:08,100
- Life is not all
it should be right now.

581
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,100
- You know what'd
give it sparkle?

582
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,934
- Dmitri Wodlowski,
Eric McNally.

583
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:18,234
- Hey, it's good to meet you eh... Still
slamming them around like you used to?

584
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:21,968
- No, it's beer league hockey for
me. Enjoy the young legs while you...

585
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,601
Oh.

586
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,133
Sorry, Dmitri. So...

587
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:36,200
- Um, well you know, ever since
I was a little boy

588
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,367
I watched you bank more penalty
as a rookie than--

589
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,868
Ha!

590
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,434
Sorry, excuse me.
Sorry. You were saying?

591
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:52,234
- No, it's... You were a great
fighter. It's uh...

592
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:55,133
Was that Good King Wenceslas?

593
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:58,267
I don't think so.

594
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:01,501
Excuse me.

595
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:04,000
Hello?!

596
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm sorry. Who?

597
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:11,334
- Ah, Scot's teacher has
asked for a private meeting

598
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:16,734
between you and your Sam
at Thursday's open house.

599
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,901
A meeting? Already?

600
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,901
- People tend
to come around 7.

601
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:29,968
Ah, terrific.

602
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:35,367
- Oh, I forgot!
Semi-finals are today.

603
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:38,100
- Tone it down, Scot.
- Go Mad Dogs!

604
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,634
Alright, okay.

605
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,434
I thought Sam sent you
to school as a hobo.

606
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:45,501
- I am a hobo.
A pretty hobo.

607
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:47,868
- Where'd you get the makeup?
- It was my mom's.

608
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:50,100
- Just 'cause your mom had makeup
doesn't mean you have to wear it, Scot.

609
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,801
I should be able to wear it.
Mrs. Patterson says it's a double-standard.

610
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,968
That boys should be able to wear
makeup too, you know!

611
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,968
- Someone ought to take away
Ms Patterson's makeup

612
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:00,968
and did you change
the ring-tone on my cellphone?

613
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:02,968
- Don't you
find it festive?

614
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,133
- I think Scot
might be gay.

615
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,367
- What was your
first clue?

616
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,133
- No, I know. But I think
he might really be gay.

617
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,801
Gay. Gay.

618
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:21,601
The good news: I'm pretty sure
he was gay before he got here.

619
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,467
- How is that
good news?

620
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,100
- We're in the
clear on this.

621
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,133
Okay, uh...

622
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,133
Fine, Scot's gay.

623
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,267
Or at least he has
gay tendencies.

624
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:38,701
I knew I was gay when I was
his age and I turned out fine.

625
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:40,734
Yeah Sam, you turned out fine.

626
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:43,100
Yes, more than fine.
But...

627
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,968
Did you walk down the hallways of your
public school in full blown makeup?

628
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:51,601
- # Soon be there #
- You have a lovely voice.

629
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:55,200
- Did you prance through the varsity
basketball team screaming "Go Panthers", huh?

630
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,934
I mean, this kid has
no idea how to behave.

631
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,467
None. I'm talking self-
preservation here, Sam.

632
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,400
Well, he'll learn.

633
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,100
When? When will he learn?

634
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,601
And you did not see the looks on these
kids' faces, Sam. It was humiliating.

635
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,601
For him or for you?

636
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:18,033
'Lo.

637
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,434
<i>- Sammy. Que pasa? What's up?
- What's up? Scot's up.</i>

638
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,434
When are you coming
up to pick him up?

639
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,434
- Give him to me.
- Sammy listen.

640
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:29,100
Right now I got a lot
happening right now.

641
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,501
What with the closing of
the, the shop and everything.

642
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,167
- You have a shop?!
- Had a shop. Dive shop.

643
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,767
But you know, like, Latinos are
not big on flippers and shit,

644
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:41,100
so... I need more time, okay?

645
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
That's what I need 'cause right
now I have some very recent

646
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,200
uh, developments,
prospects that are happening.

647
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,033
Very, very recent prospects.
- Billy.

648
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:53,534
- Sam, you're breaking up.
Can you hear...

649
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:56,734
Billy!

650
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,100
You work. I work. Neither of us can
be around to supervise him all the time.

651
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,534
- I shouldn't have to deal with him at all.
- You don't. I get him up.

652
00:40:25,534 --> 00:40:27,968
I put him to bed and the fridge,
you see how fast that thing empties?

653
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,934
Whose fault is that? I didn't
want him here in the first place.

654
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:33,067
- The makeup, the jewellery he's
wearing is all his mother's.

655
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,067
He's in a phase of mourning.
- We can deal with that--

656
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:36,784
It's a phase you better
pull him out of Sam and fast.

657
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:38,501
You can't pull someone out

658
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,284
of a phase that's why
they call it a phase.

659
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:42,067
En! No such word as can't.

660
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:42,717
You cannot pull
someone out of a phase?

661
00:40:42,718 --> 00:40:43,367
No such word as can't.

662
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,734
It's a sports expression.

663
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,167
Sports expression.

664
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,400
Would you like my advice?

665
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,634
- Please.
- Okay, so Scot reads a lot.

666
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:57,868
Right, which is excellent.

667
00:40:57,868 --> 00:40:59,868
But no television?

668
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:03,567
Eric, watches television. He
watches the television for all of us.

669
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:06,801
- It's my job. I work in TV.
- Right, I know.

670
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:13,167
Okay, so here at Stinson school, we like to
encourage the children to be active viewers.

671
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:16,334
One of the positives
that television provides

672
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:20,467
is that it presents more
uh, traditional role models.

673
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:22,467
Heroes...

674
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:27,100
That the kids can
really look up to.

675
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:35,968
- So, you want him
to watch more TV?

676
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:38,634
- To find better
role models?

677
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:41,968
No. Not better. Other.

678
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:49,267
To add to the two fine ones
he already has.

679
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:53,801
Do you wanna make a complaint?
'Cause that'll make him popular.

680
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:55,801
- Well, I guess there's
always private school.

681
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:57,934
- I thought the idea was
to make him less gay.

682
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,501
- Stop it you guys.
- Hey Scot, you ready to go?

683
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,234
We're trying to make Carla throw up.

684
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:03,968
I hardly do it at all anymore!

685
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,251
Good for you.

686
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,534
Oh hi Andrea, you
here for Ms Paul too?

687
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,634
- Ryan's failing everything.
- Not gym.

688
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:12,434
- Everything except gym.
- Stop!

689
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:14,100
You want my advice?

690
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:15,767
You're freaks. Why
would I want freak advice?

691
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:20,834
When you go in, don't get mad or yell. Act
really sorry that you're not very smart.

692
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,501
She'll probably
feel sorry for you.

693
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:26,701
I know I would.
- Fuck it!

694
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,868
Okay, that's good with the advice,
Scot. Say goodnight. Let's go.

695
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:33,200
Goodnight, Carla.
Goodnight, Joey.

696
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:38,200
- Whoa! Don't you touch me.
- Hey get him off!

697
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,400
- Hey, hey, hey that's enough.
- I'm gonna be...

698
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:49,334
- Oh. Ah...
We need to do something.

699
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,868
There's a hierarchy of gestures

700
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:55,868
specifically
the affectionate kind.

701
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,901
- He's a kid
Samuel, not a client.

702
00:42:57,901 --> 00:43:02,501
- There's the handshake,
the shoulder punch...

703
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:04,551
There's a high-five.

704
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,601
Which is really not so
much affectionate as nerdy.

705
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:09,267
Then we get into the hugs.

706
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:12,968
There's the
short hug/pat on the back.

707
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:19,601
Then there's the long hug which
is really the short hug times 3.

708
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,667
So, kissing...?

709
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,284
What about kissing?

710
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:24,901
He wants to know about kissing.

711
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:30,100
About the hierarchy of kissing,
specifically the affectionate kind.

712
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:38,868
I just want you to understand
we're not throwing anything away.

713
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,901
We're putting it
away for a little while.

714
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:44,801
- Is that a...?
- It's a toolbox.

715
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:47,868
- For tools, not for cosmetics
and fine jewellery.

716
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:49,950
This is everything?

717
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:52,033
I'm not talking to
you, either of you.

718
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:54,934
- Hey you know what?
We can... We can...

719
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:59,334
Pad the box with sort of a soft
cottony cushion. How 'bout that?

720
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:01,084
Sam?

721
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,834
Hey alright, you know what?
I'm gonna let you pack this up.

722
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,667
This is all for the best.

723
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:23,100
- I'm gonna trust
you on that one.

724
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:16,167
Hey.

725
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:19,300
Scot? I see you breathing.

726
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,534
Scot you wanna come
downstairs and have...

727
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:31,801
Some breakfast, make
some pancakes or uh...

728
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:34,367
Watch some cartoons?

729
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:37,334
Saturday morning cartoons?

730
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,367
I'm going to get groceries.

731
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:51,667
- This doesn't mean
I like you again.

732
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:58,067
Boys shave their faces?
- Yeah.

733
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:01,868
- Do they shave anyplace else?
###

734
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:04,400
- Sometimes.
- The legular region?

735
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
The legu...?

736
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Ah, no. Scot, no.

737
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,200
Well, athletes.
Only athletes.

738
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,634
You're an athlete.

739
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:17,167
- Yeah, which is why I can say
don't do it. It grows back.

740
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:20,434
Very painfully.

741
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:22,934
You would not believe
how much it itches.

742
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,934
It's not funny.

743
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:30,167
- Kids think I'm gay.
- Really?

744
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:33,534
That's a shock.

745
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,534
You know what
gay is right?

746
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:38,167
- It means they don't like me.
- It doesn't mean that.

747
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:40,667
- They don't like me very much.
- Doesn't mean that either.

748
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,467
Look, these kids that say you're
gay, they just don't know you.

749
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,467
Okay, gay is a label.

750
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,734
Okay, like short or weird.

751
00:46:48,734 --> 00:46:50,734
Not that you're
any of those.

752
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:53,767
- Yeah. My mom used to say that too.
- Good.

753
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,701
- How do you keep track of who knows?
- Who knows what?

754
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:04,267
Knows you're gay.
- I'm not...

755
00:47:04,267 --> 00:47:07,667
Okay I... I am...
But I'm not just gay.

756
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:08,817
I mean I am just gay.

757
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:09,968
- Eric?
- What?

758
00:47:09,968 --> 00:47:12,100
- That's processed cheese.
- So.

759
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,167
You have to get the real cheese,
the pre-sliced kind for sandwiches.

760
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,067
- Alright, let's get the pre-
sliced kind for sandwiches.

761
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:24,267
- What about back before
you were just gay?

762
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:26,267
What about it?

763
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:29,200
You probably didn't want anybody
to know back then either right?

764
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,901
So you must've faked
being not "just gay".

765
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:35,067
- Yeah so.
- What did you do?

766
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,834
- I didn't have
to do anything.

767
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,834
I played hockey.

768
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:42,334
Where you going?
Where you going?!

769
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:44,868
Back pass. Heads up! Heads up!

770
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:48,634
Oh, there's your pocket picked.

771
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,767
Oh, keep it on the ice!

772
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:59,033
You having a good time?

773
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:01,434
- The skating's
not bad.

774
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:04,334
- You know how
to skate huh?

775
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:42,000
Greg.

776
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,534
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

777
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,067
- I'm here with my kid, that's
my son Lawrence over there.

778
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:49,167
There he is right there, yeah.
- That's your boy?

779
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:50,834
- Yeah.
How 'bout you?

780
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,100
Uh... I had a
pick-up game.

781
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,400
Pick-up game.
- Okay.

782
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,834
So um...

783
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,968
Nula give you any
of that tape we shot?

784
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:02,534
Yeah, I watched it.

785
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:05,267
- Questions,
comments, praise?

786
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:08,934
- I mean, uh, the stuff you
were doing was kind of unfocused

787
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:11,534
and I don't know, you didn't really
get into it with the players, you know?

788
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,601
Yeah. What?

789
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,284
No sure I did.

790
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,968
- Look at that kid go.
- Which kid?

791
00:49:16,968 --> 00:49:19,934
- Which kid? That kid?
- Yeah, you know that kid?

792
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:22,133
- That kid,
with the uh...

793
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:24,133
Uh, ah.

794
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,667
Oh.

795
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,901
You okay?

796
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:35,834
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Everybody falls, Scot. Up.

797
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:38,434
- But the rest is
good enough right?

798
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,534
- Good enough for what?
- To play hockey.

799
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:49,767
He wants to play hockey.

800
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,767
- He does, does he?
- Right Scot?

801
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,767
Come meet the coach.

802
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:57,467
- He ever play peewee before?
- No.

803
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,467
But my mom taught
me how to skate.

804
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:02,667
I can even do the butterfly--
- He's good. Good skater coach.

805
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:07,000
Eric McNally! Wow!

806
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,901
2000, Stanley Cup
semi-finals. Game 7.

807
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:11,367
You poked in the
winning goal in overtime.

808
00:50:11,368 --> 00:50:12,834
That was me.

809
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:15,767
- I'm Bud Wilson, the coach.
- Nice to meet you coach.

810
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:17,417
You were quite the
scrapper 'til you got injured.

811
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:19,067
Well...

812
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:22,868
- Now you're on TV.
Didn't know you had a son.

813
00:50:22,868 --> 00:50:24,868
I'm Scot. He's Eric. He's g--

814
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:28,501
Ah we're game coach. We're game
for... Anything else you need from us?

815
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,167
Eric.

816
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:31,834
- Ah, no.
- Hey get outta here.

817
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:35,200
- What? Ryan Burlington
plays on your team?

818
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,867
He's our star center, why?

819
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,534
Yeah maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

820
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:41,334
Scot's pretty fresh. Your team
looks pretty advanced. I don't--

821
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:45,133
Listen. I'm looking for an assistant
coach. You'd be here all the time.

822
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:47,334
Give the boy the attention
he needs. Hey guys...

823
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:51,200
How would like a real former Maple
Leaf to be your assistant coach?

824
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,400
Coach, I don't know--

825
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
- Do the jerseys
only come in orange?

826
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:05,234
- Okay, now you try...
Whoa, hold on a second.

827
00:51:05,234 --> 00:51:07,467
Whoa, hold on. See, this is how
you grip your stick, okay?

828
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:09,534
This guy's over.
You see how my hand is? Over.

829
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:11,534
And then this guy
is under like that.

830
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:14,567
Okay. And stop holding
it so tight.

831
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:18,000
You're holding it like a bandit. No
one's gonna knock it away from you.

832
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay just... You don't wanna
let the team down right?

833
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,200
It just takes practice alright.
Eye on the ball and...

834
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,467
Let 'er rip. Let 'er rip.

835
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,234
Uh-huh. Good.
It's not bad.

836
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,234
Just here's
the thing...

837
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:36,734
Keep your legs slightly bent. Keep
your eye on the ball and let 'er rip!

838
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:40,767
Oh! Good. Good. Good.
That's great.

839
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,834
Okay so look.
Any questions just holler.

840
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:44,834
Remember it's
all in the wrist.

841
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,567
- Eric! How did you
and Sam meet?

842
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,450
Well when I got injured,
Sam took care of me.

843
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:53,334
He's good at that.

844
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:57,200
He is. Yeah.

845
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,667
- He'll be happy I'm
playing hockey right?

846
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,434
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

847
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:05,868
- Ah no, you should've talked to
me before you signed him up.

848
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:08,067
- You know, it all happened so
fast and you were in meetings.

849
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:10,400
Besides it was Scot's
idea. He wanted to.

850
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,634
- Really?
- I was as surprised as you.

851
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,367
Turns out he's
not a bad skater.

852
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,534
What? He's not!?

853
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,567
Julie taught him.

854
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:23,234
Scot...

855
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:28,067
Hey, you wanna come inside? I got pizza,
pop and on TV women's figureskating.

856
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:35,334
I can't. Eric will be disappointed
if I can't hit the garage.

857
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:39,167
It's 'cause you're looking at the
ground when you're shooting idiot.

858
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,534
Nula...

859
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:41,901
Shut up!
I'm not gonna kill you.

860
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:45,100
I took your advice. I told Ms
Paul I was sorry for being stupid

861
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,801
and now she's giving me D
minuses instead of Fs.

862
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:51,000
And I'm not even trying.
- Congratulations.

863
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,300
- Yes, aim high.
- You're not hitting the ball

864
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,200
'cause you're trying to smash
it. You gotta flick it first.

865
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,434
See? Now you try.

866
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,434
TRY!

867
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,767
See?

868
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:12,150
Scot?

869
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,534
I think I'll stay
outside a little longer.

870
00:53:14,534 --> 00:53:18,501
You know, you're kinda cute.

871
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:24,300
- The longer Scot stays,
the greater the attachment.

872
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,334
Think what it's gonna
be like when he leaves.

873
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:28,667
Yeah, don't worry about that. There's plenty
of kids on the team that can replace him.

874
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:32,467
For Scot, when Scot leaves.

875
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:35,000
- And when's that
happening exactly? I mean...

876
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,667
How many times have you
called Billy only to hear:

877
00:53:36,668 --> 00:53:38,334
"I need more time. I need more time"?

878
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:43,968
What?
- Billy called.

879
00:53:43,968 --> 00:53:45,434
And?

880
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:46,901
- He needs more time.
- See.

881
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:48,901
- But only
'til Christmas.

882
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,367
Scot'll play hockey 'til Christmas.
It'll be good for him you know?

883
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:53,667
He'll meet
some new friends.

884
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:56,367
Maybe it'll tough him up a little
bit. Plus I'll be there to coach him.

885
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,133
- Assistant coach.
- Assistant coach.

886
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:09,734
- Wow. All I ever won was
a plaque for attendance once.

887
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:13,234
- What's it like living
with 2 gay guys?

888
00:54:13,234 --> 00:54:16,234
- They're not gay.
- Ho, they're gay.

889
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:19,300
- They don't sit
around kissing or anything.

890
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,601
My mom died.
They're taking care of me.

891
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:26,000
They're nice though.
Hey Ryan.

892
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,601
Play the Casio?
- Yeah.

893
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,534
- Do you know any songs? Maybe
of the Christmas carol variety?

894
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,634
Your mom's dead?

895
00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:38,667
- Yeah, there was
a car accident and...

896
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:42,934
People keep saying
she died in a car crash.

897
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:46,100
She didn't.
Why would they tell me that?

898
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,033
She took drugs. A lot of drugs
and this one time...

899
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:51,267
She took too many.

900
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:55,734
- You're lying.
She never did that.

901
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:59,701
Cross my heart, hope to die.

902
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:03,067
- Hey.
- Hey.

903
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,601
Here I was thinking
babysit Scot, it'll be fun.

904
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,701
You know, good time girls
night in kind of fun

905
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:10,133
but you didn't tell
me Scot's Mr. Hockey now.

906
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,417
Where is he?

907
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:14,701
He's down the street. He found
another Mr. Hockey to hang with.

908
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:24,734
- Oh. I heard some
scuffling earlier.

909
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:29,200
Maybe a couple cries of help.
That was about an hour ago.

910
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,300
- What kind
did she take?

911
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,467
- She started off
taking pills.

912
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:41,000
She said it messed
her up too much.

913
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,067
So she switched to the kind
you get in needles.

914
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:47,400
She used to stick 2 needles
this big in between her toes.

915
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,400
That way no one
would see the marks.

916
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,901
Not like if they
were on her arm.

917
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,467
Did you see her?

918
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,968
Take a needle? Once.

919
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:03,300
- But did you
see her dead?

920
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:15,467
If you stick the needle in wrong, air
bubbles get created into your body.

921
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:19,934
They go all the way to your heart
and your heart explodes and you die.

922
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,467
She died.

923
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:36,033
- I thought you
said that...

924
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,167
- Child
Services said...

925
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:50,734
- Hey? What kind of
conditioner do you use?

926
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:54,567
- Hey, guys.
What's going on?

927
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:57,367
- Ryan plays a Casio.
- Shut up.

928
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:59,367
My girlfriend
likes it.

929
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:02,601
- Okay Scot,
time to go.

930
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:09,033
Hey listen Scot. Billy called

931
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:12,300
and um, he's not gonna be making
it up here 'til Christmas.

932
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,200
- Alright, how do you
feel about that?

933
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,667
- Fuck it.
Whatever.

934
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:23,267
So you're buying
me this garter belt

935
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:27,234
to hold up my hockey socks over
which I'll pull my girdle?

936
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:29,601
- Yeah.
- Irony noted.

937
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:31,501
Oh hey Scot.

938
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:34,801
- Hey Joey.
- Joey Morita.

939
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:36,968
I heard you joined the team.

940
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:38,968
Coach asked me what
position I should play.

941
00:57:38,968 --> 00:57:41,100
I told him I don't have any
hockey or skating experience

942
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,300
so I'm the goalie.

943
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,400
- Huh. That's great.
- A little bit tighter please.

944
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,567
- Tighter?
- Mm-hm.

945
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:54,968
- How's that?
###

946
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:02,350
Wait up!

947
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,567
Come on Scot. The
crosswalk's for freaks. Yeah!

948
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:09,334
Woo!
- Wah!

949
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Oi.

950
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,883
What are we gonna do?!

951
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,133
- Back check!
- And...

952
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:48,868
Break!

953
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,834
Back check, back check and go!

954
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:58,667
See your man. Who do you got?!

955
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:09,801
Alright boys, good game now.

956
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:18,667
- Pass it here.
- Pass it up. Pass it up!

957
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:22,968
Keep going! Come on stay on
you right, stay on your right.

958
01:00:27,901 --> 01:00:30,901
You're good.

959
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:34,534
- Nice hit, Burlington.
Shake it off, Finn.

960
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:43,901
Watch how Conhill uses his body.
Shields coming around the net.

961
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:46,667
Gets the shot off.
- Yeah and they jammed the slot.

962
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:49,901
- Jammed the slot.
- Yeah, they jammed the slot.

963
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:51,884
Hey Eric, you wanna
give me a hand with this?

964
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,868
No thanks, we're good.

965
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,317
You guys ready and yeah!

966
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:15,100
- Alright. Listen up.
Good practice guys.

967
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,400
For your first game Wednesday,
I got the starting string.

968
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,917
Ryan, you're centre. JP,
you're coming up the right.

969
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:20,434
Yes!

970
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:22,434
And coming up the left...

971
01:01:22,434 --> 01:01:25,000
Coming up the left is Scot.

972
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,434
Ha. What about me?

973
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,701
Everybody plays. Don't worry Finn,
I'll play you right after Ryan. Eric?

974
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:33,767
Okay so uh...

975
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,601
Good game.
- Yeah!

976
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,868
- Got a big game coming up on
Wednesday guys. Big game.

977
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:41,968
So uh... Well this game you
know... Remember...

978
01:01:41,968 --> 01:01:45,534
Not... You know hockey isn't the
only game we're playing here.

979
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:51,300
You know, how you behave on the
ice is a lot about how you behave.

980
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,133
You guys are... I mean I really,
the last couple weeks...

981
01:01:54,133 --> 01:02:00,133
Watching you guys do your you
know... You guys are...

982
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:07,734
Here's the thing guys...

983
01:02:07,734 --> 01:02:10,300
When I say ziggy you say boom.
Ziggy!

984
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,300
Boom!

985
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:12,300
- Ziggy!
- Boom!

986
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,634
- Ziggy! Ziggy! Ziggy!
- Boom! Boom! Boom!

987
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:17,300
- Now get some sleep and
Wednesday get ready to kill 'em!

988
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,300
Yeah!

989
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,501
Hey for a minute there I thought
you were gonna call for a group hug.

990
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,100
I'd rather fight than talk but
kill 'em might've been a little...

991
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,200
I'm gonna...

992
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,701
You suck! You can't pass.

993
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:38,534
You can't shoot.
And your gay dad's a gay!

994
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:40,534
The word's faggot, O'Brian.

995
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:44,534
- Stop fighting. It's
like Eric said or tried to say.

996
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:46,534
We have to work
together as a team.

997
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:49,767
And he's not my dad
and he's not a gay.

998
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:54,834
Don't ever say that
about him again, okay?

999
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:01,534
Stop fighting you guys.

1000
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:04,834
Stop fighting you guys!

1001
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:08,634
Hey Joey, those
skates, are they new?

1002
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,734
Uh, kinda new.

1003
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:17,067
- Toss me one,
I'm gonna try it on.

1004
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:21,901
- Hey.
- Oh hey. Get this.

1005
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:24,834
Couple of the Canada Juniors
found out I'm assistant coaching

1006
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,033
and they got
a look at Nula

1007
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:29,901
so they're actually gonna come to Scot's
first game. You're bringing people right?

1008
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:34,367
- Uh... I wasn't planning on it.
- No? Maybe you should ask Joan.

1009
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:38,434
Or Mildred.
- Mildred, cheer hockey?

1010
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:42,501
Are you kidding me? Mildred'd
be the loudest one in the stands.

1011
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:45,234
I just think it'd be nice to have
people there, you know for Scot.

1012
01:03:48,834 --> 01:03:53,601
- Ha. So if I wanna come
watch Scot play hockey

1013
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:55,601
I gotta travel in a pack?

1014
01:03:55,601 --> 01:03:59,067
Come on Sam.

1015
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:03,667
- Sam. Sam! What are the police
doing at Ryan's house?

1016
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:22,801
I hate Joey Morita.

1017
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:28,634
- Why do you hate Joey Morita so
much? Joey's your friend.

1018
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:32,267
- He's not. He told his mom that
Ryan stole his skates.

1019
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:34,634
- Did Ryan steal his skates?
- Yeah.

1020
01:04:34,634 --> 01:04:36,801
Well then...

1021
01:04:36,802 --> 01:04:38,968
Ryan's going to juvie and I'm dead.

1022
01:04:38,968 --> 01:04:41,267
Did you just say juvie?

1023
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:45,534
They're going to kick Ryan off the team,
aren't they? I need him to protect me.

1024
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:48,667
- No. You don't need protection.
- What if I get hurt?

1025
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,334
The way you did. Ryan said that someone
rammed you into the boards and broke

1026
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,084
your shoulder during practice.

1027
01:04:54,085 --> 01:04:55,834
That wasn't really much of a break.

1028
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:59,734
- In four places.
- Four little places.

1029
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:02,734
Ryan also said when you played
hockey they used to call you Erica.

1030
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:07,133
- Ryan said that?
Good luck in juvie, Ryan.

1031
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:09,734
That's why I'm dead.

1032
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,834
Sit up, Scot.

1033
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:26,701
Now, look at me.
Look at me.

1034
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:30,033
I want you to
make a fist, okay?

1035
01:05:30,033 --> 01:05:32,868
Fist.
That's it. Good.

1036
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:36,767
Alright, now hold it up in front
of your face. That's it.

1037
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,501
Like that.
Like that.

1038
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:41,017
You're teaching me to fight?

1039
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:42,534
I'm teaching you to
protect yourself. Okay?

1040
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,534
And the first thing
I want you to remember...

1041
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:47,200
- Protect the face.
- Protect the face.

1042
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,367
Good game.

1043
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,667
Warming up!

1044
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:01,701
- Pick it up!
- Gum, coach?

1045
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:05,133
- Never use it.
- Hey, Eric!

1046
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,667
- Some friends up there,
McNally?

1047
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:10,300
- Yeah, I got a few...
Holy crap, everybody's up there.

1048
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,734
Hey, Eric!

1049
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,634
- Alright now, boys.
Game faces! Game faces!

1050
01:06:17,634 --> 01:06:20,634
- Sam, which
one's Scot?

1051
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:23,968
He's number 25. Right there.

1052
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:28,267
And to think before yard work he
used to ask me for a scrunchie.

1053
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:35,601
- Come on, guys!
- Alright now boys! Game faces!

1054
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:38,734
Game faces!
- Come on.

1055
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,901
Go Marathon!

1056
01:06:55,567 --> 01:06:58,667
Scot! Scot!

1057
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:00,601
Scot! Scot!

1058
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:04,968
Have a good game, Scot.
You're the best.

1059
01:07:07,934 --> 01:07:10,767
Alright, boys, first game, right? I know
you must be just itching to go at each other.

1060
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:13,634
But keep it clean.
Let's have some fun.

1061
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,534
What the hell?

1062
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,434
Isn't he supposed to
go after the other goalie?

1063
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:23,634
You're going the wrong way!

1064
01:07:30,601 --> 01:07:33,100
Hey! Don't! No!

1065
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,901
- Hey McNally, get back here!
McNally!

1066
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:38,167
- Scot,
what are you doing?

1067
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,734
Protect the face, Joey.

1068
01:07:41,734 --> 01:07:43,834
But we're best friends!

1069
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:45,501
Agh!
- Whoa!

1070
01:07:47,634 --> 01:07:50,300
- Hey! Scot!
Scot! Get off him.

1071
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,467
Get off him.
- Let me go.

1072
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,050
What are you doing? You're
out of the game. You're done.

1073
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,634
Why?

1074
01:07:57,634 --> 01:08:00,167
- Why? Why? Look! Look at him,
alright. You're out of the game.

1075
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,400
- What do you think you're doing?
- Give me a second here.

1076
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,483
Out of the game. I'm not joking.

1077
01:08:03,484 --> 01:08:04,567
 Oh my God,
you're Eric McNally?

1078
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:07,467
Yes. Yes. I'm Eric... Yes, I'm Eric McNally.
I played for the Leafs. Yeah, I liked to fight.

1079
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:09,701
I got injured. I'm on TV. Give
me one second here. Skates off!

1080
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:12,534
- No, it's not fair.
- Go. Go!

1081
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:15,534
Smooth move, genius.

1082
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,434
- Sam... Sam.
- You taught him to fight?

1083
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:24,850
Well, I taught him to
defend himself, yes.

1084
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,267
By fighting?

1085
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:28,667
What was I supposed to do?
Have him lob vanilla pudding at people?

1086
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:32,334
- Go on. Go back to your hockey.
I'm taking Scot home.

1087
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:35,267
The hierarchy of affectionate gestures
doesn't exactly list high-sticking.

1088
01:08:35,267 --> 01:08:37,267
We were a little lost
and if it weren't for me

1089
01:08:37,267 --> 01:08:39,100
this kid would be coming home
in full makeup every day.

1090
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,133
- He'd be happier.
- He'd be dead is what he'd be.

1091
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:44,200
Pulverized by some bully's fist in
the schoolyard. You don't remember?

1092
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,234
- It's not my fault!
- I am mad at you.

1093
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:48,534
Joey is your friend, right.
You don't do that to friends.

1094
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:51,467
Come here. You are gonna say,
I'm sorry to Joey and Bud

1095
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:52,733
and anyone else that needs to
hear it. Let me hear you say it.

1096
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm sorry.

1097
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,183
Again! Again!

1098
01:08:55,184 --> 01:08:56,367
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. That's enough.

1099
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:57,950
You saw what he did.

1100
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,534
I didn't even want to
do your stupid hockey!

1101
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:01,617
I only did it to make you happy
and you don't like anything I do.

1102
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,701
That's not true.

1103
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:05,251
I hate it here and I hate you!

1104
01:09:05,252 --> 01:09:06,801
Good. Good because you're
coming with me... Come here.

1105
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:10,334
You are coming with me and
you're gonna say "I'm sorry."

1106
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:12,801
You're gonna find out the consequences
of pulling such a cheap stunt--

1107
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:15,601
Eric, he's not your kid.

1108
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,000
Hey, Scot...

1109
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:00,701
- Well, we're gonna
miss you, Scot.

1110
01:12:00,701 --> 01:12:05,300
Class, why don't we all tell Scot
how much we're gonna miss him?

1111
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,367
Say it with me, now.
Ready?

1112
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,367
One, two, three...

1113
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:13,133
- We'll
miss you, Scot.

1114
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:18,334
- Everybody open their
readers to page nine.

1115
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:29,801
- Alright,
people, one more week.

1116
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:31,801
Now, when you get to Reykjavik

1117
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:33,901
you're gonna smell the World Juniors
as soon as you get off the plane.

1118
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,934
And I'm not talking
about the locker room either.

1119
01:12:37,934 --> 01:12:41,434
I'm talking about the excitement. Now,
between practice time and game time,

1120
01:12:41,434 --> 01:12:45,934
it gets really hectic in there which means
interview time's going to be very tight.

1121
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:49,400
I need you all to be sharp and I'm gonna
be looking for you to be ready with--

1122
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,400
That's Scot.

1123
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:56,567
Eric?

1124
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:59,734
- I'll step outside.
- I need you to be here.

1125
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:01,767
Right after this call.

1126
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:04,834
- That I really need
you to take, later.

1127
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:07,567
Unless, of course, you want to
skip Reykjavik altogether

1128
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:09,868
and cover women's soccer
'til the end of time.

1129
01:13:14,968 --> 01:13:16,968
Hello.

1130
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:20,801
Joan,
yeah. I'll...

1131
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:24,801
I'll call you back.

1132
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:27,100
Are you done?

1133
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:44,067
- Did I tell you I've been
taking care of this boy, Scot?

1134
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:47,501
You met him actually, Greg.
The day at the rink.

1135
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:49,901
He was the kid doing the...

1136
01:13:49,901 --> 01:13:53,067
Twirling.

1137
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:56,334
Anyway uh...

1138
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:59,734
I've been looking after him.

1139
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:03,000
Except today my brother...

1140
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,234
Well, my so-called brother-in-
law Billy coming up from Brazil

1141
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:08,567
To get him...

1142
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:11,667
Take him back to Brazil.

1143
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,534
I ever tell you when I played
pro they used to call me Erica?

1144
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,167
Hey, guys, I thought I'd...

1145
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:45,868
- Hey! The hockey hero! Give me
a hockey handshake there.

1146
01:14:45,868 --> 01:14:47,384
Hey. Eric.

1147
01:14:47,385 --> 01:14:48,901
- Hey. Billy.
- Right.

1148
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:52,000
- Hey, listen, thanks for... For
taking care of the Scoot there

1149
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,033
for the past couple of months.
I really appreciate that.

1150
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,734
- Hm.
- Come on.

1151
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:59,434
We were just sitting down having
a little something, you know.

1152
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:02,200
- Ah, someone's been cooking.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1153
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,200
I guess he started whipping
stuff up there in his...

1154
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,234
In his little apron there
when we came to the door.

1155
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:08,467
All you had was coffee.

1156
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:10,467
Hasn't changed.

1157
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:13,367
Not... not a bit.

1158
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:16,701
- I really grew.
- Huh? What's that?

1159
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:18,734
I grew. Can't you tell?

1160
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:20,634
Cute.

1161
01:15:20,634 --> 01:15:24,501
You don't want to change. Right?
You don't want to do that. Trust me.

1162
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:28,501
Scot, why don't you ask Billy what
kind of school you're gonna be going to?

1163
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:31,434
<i>- School. Yeah. We're gonna check that out
when we... when we get back. Right, mi amigo ?</i>

1164
01:15:31,434 --> 01:15:33,934
- Well, yeah. Because he's
already missed September

1165
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:36,267
and he shouldn't...
He shouldn't miss much more.

1166
01:15:36,267 --> 01:15:38,901
- I'll make
a mental note of that.

1167
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:42,067
- Yeah. And don't they speak
Portuguese down there?

1168
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,067
- I'll make a mental note
of that... that too.

1169
01:15:44,067 --> 01:15:47,868
Whoa! I need a...
Dying for a smoke.

1170
01:15:47,868 --> 01:15:51,434
But don't...
Don't you do this, okay?

1171
01:15:51,434 --> 01:15:54,133
Especially not in a nice fancy
potpourri house like uh...

1172
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,300
Like this here.

1173
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,534
I need you tell me where the lawyer is
'cause I gotta do this whole insurance thing,

1174
01:15:58,534 --> 01:16:01,400
get that taken care of. Nice
meeting you there, Eric. Thank you.

1175
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:18,400
- Scot.
- What?

1176
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,701
I'm coming up.

1177
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:26,801
Hey, bud.

1178
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:34,067
Listen, don't worry
about Billy, okay?

1179
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:39,000
Billy means well. He does.
He's just... he's energetic.

1180
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,868
If Billy doesn't want me I'll
have to go back to Child Services.

1181
01:16:42,868 --> 01:16:44,701
And you guys don't want me and
my mom doesn't want me 'cause--

1182
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:46,534
Whoa.

1183
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:51,234
No!

1184
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:58,467
What happened to your mom
was an accident.

1185
01:16:58,467 --> 01:17:02,267
She never would have done anything
to take herself away from you.

1186
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:06,701
And it's not that we don't
want you. It's just...

1187
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:14,467
A long time ago your mom decided that
Billy would be the one to take care of you.

1188
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:17,300
And Billy is...

1189
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,000
Billy's a good guy.
I like Billy.

1190
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,767
You're... You're
a lucky guy, Scot.

1191
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:26,334
Brazil is gonna be cool.
Like, I mean, not cool.

1192
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:30,267
It's gonna be hot, but it'll
be cool. Alright?

1193
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:36,601
I should get back to packing.

1194
01:17:44,968 --> 01:17:48,067
- Hoo... Asshole!
- You're right.

1195
01:17:48,067 --> 01:17:50,100
- I want to punch
him in his face.

1196
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,634
Maybe you should punch me.

1197
01:17:53,634 --> 01:18:01,000
It's my fault, Sam.
I screwed up. This poor kid.

1198
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,968
He's upstairs
and he thinks...

1199
01:18:04,968 --> 01:18:08,000
He doesn't know who he is or
where he belongs or if he belongs.

1200
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,067
He doesn't think
that he has...

1201
01:18:10,067 --> 01:18:12,801
He doesn't have Billy, he doesn't have
his mom and he thinks he doesn't have us.

1202
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:16,634
And the idea of sending him away
in this state is killing me.

1203
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:24,167
I thought...

1204
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:27,534
Well, what does
Scot like? Christmas.

1205
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:30,234
I thought...

1206
01:18:30,234 --> 01:18:35,434
What if we give the kid a big
going away party in his honour?

1207
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:38,067
A big...

1208
01:18:38,067 --> 01:18:40,067
Old, gay...

1209
01:18:40,067 --> 01:18:45,701
I mean, gay in a traditional
sense, Christmas party.

1210
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,334
Ryan. What's this?

1211
01:19:02,334 --> 01:19:04,501
- Scot told me to
bring my Casio. So I did.

1212
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:07,367
I brought my faggoty Casio.
- Is "faggoty" a word, Ryan?

1213
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,367
- What, am I a dictionary?
- Boots.

1214
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:13,300
- Oh God, always with the boots.
You know, for an NHL player,

1215
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:17,334
you live in the gayest
house in the world.

1216
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,300
- Hey! Mildred's ham.
The true meaning of Christmas.

1217
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,617
Where's Scot?
I have a present.

1218
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:24,934
Give it here.

1219
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:26,934
- You won't forget it?
- Will I forget it?

1220
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:31,067
Guests.

1221
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,167
You know what? I actually
kind of like girls' soccer.

1222
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,868
- I actually think Greg's
downgraded you to croquet.

1223
01:19:35,868 --> 01:19:40,234
- One mention of
the word 'Erica' and--

1224
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,400
- That had nothing to do with
it. Everyone already knew.

1225
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:53,850
Eric.

1226
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:55,634
Hey, George Junior. Look
who made it out of his room.

1227
01:19:55,634 --> 01:19:59,200
- My mom slid a map under my
bedroom door. You don't mind?

1228
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,601
- Oh no. No. I'm
glad you're here.

1229
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:03,501
George, this is Nula.
Nula, this is...

1230
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:07,200
Jesus Christ, George.
All that with my weights?

1231
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,501
- Yeah. Spend a few months
living with my mother

1232
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:11,701
you find ways
to work out aggression.

1233
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:14,734
You're a hockey player, too?

1234
01:20:14,734 --> 01:20:17,267
- No. I have a pretty thorough
disdain for sports of any kind.

1235
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:19,234
Really?

1236
01:20:23,434 --> 01:20:28,100
- Why don't you go on in
and grab a protein shake,

1237
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,133
power bar or something?

1238
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:33,467
Take it easy on the boy.

1239
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:38,834
- Mr. Latour?
- Joey Morita.

1240
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,300
Good on you for coming. Kick
off your boots and follow me.

1241
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,133
- I'm not sure this is a
very good idea, Mr. Latour.

1242
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:47,133
I'm not Mr. La...

1243
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:49,133
My last name is Mc...

1244
01:20:51,133 --> 01:20:53,133
Follow me.

1245
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:55,533
Hey, gang.

1246
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:57,934
- Look, Mr. Latour.
- I'm not Mr. Lat--

1247
01:20:57,934 --> 01:21:00,334
- I'm tinsel. I sparkle.
- And me.

1248
01:21:00,334 --> 01:21:03,434
I'm on. I'm off.
I'm on. I'm off.

1249
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:07,334
- Neat trick.
Scot! Hey, Scot, Joey's here.

1250
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:09,384
Joey's here?

1251
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:11,434
Yeah. You have something
you'd like to say to him?

1252
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:14,133
- Hey.
- Hi.

1253
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:17,167
- You have something else
you'd like to say to him?

1254
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:20,467
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

1255
01:21:20,467 --> 01:21:22,701
No, guys. No. Joey, no.

1256
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:25,467
Don't you want to tell Scot that when he
popped you in the beak, it hurt your feelings?

1257
01:21:25,467 --> 01:21:27,634
And you, don't you want to tell Joey
what a really good friend of yours he is?

1258
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,667
- I bled a lot
when you hit me.

1259
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:33,467
The entire crease was red.
- We have to tell Carla that.

1260
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:37,167
- Yeah.
- That's... Good job, men.

1261
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:39,033
Okay, everybody, we're just
about ready for you.

1262
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,868
- Hey, Joey. You can
be the angel. Come here.

1263
01:21:41,868 --> 01:21:44,534
You ready?

1264
01:21:44,534 --> 01:21:48,200
- Not going to do it.
- Why not?

1265
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,801
- Billy's gonna
think I'm a sissy.

1266
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:13,400
- We're all a little
sissy around here.

1267
01:22:25,534 --> 01:22:27,534
Scot and Joey
just buried the hatchet.

1268
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:29,350
Oh, hey, Eric.
Ask Billy about his suit?

1269
01:22:29,351 --> 01:22:31,167
Suit?

1270
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:32,683
Italian. I wanted to look nice
for when I met Mia's family.

1271
01:22:32,684 --> 01:22:34,200
Mia?

1272
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,217
Yeah, go ahead, ask Billy about Mia.

1273
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:36,234
Hi. I'm Mia.

1274
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:38,901
- Eric.
- Mia's Billy's fianc.

1275
01:22:38,901 --> 01:22:40,934
Fianc?

1276
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:45,567
- Mia lives in Paris and Rio and
she has family in Rosedale

1277
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:49,901
and she's Scot's big surprise. Which
is ironic because Scot was kind of hers.

1278
01:22:49,901 --> 01:22:53,701
You forgot to tell us you had a fianc and
you're gonna try and spring that on Scot now?

1279
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:56,200
- Why not? I sprang it on Mia
and she was thrilled, right?

1280
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,601
- He did.
I think it's wonderful.

1281
01:22:58,601 --> 01:23:02,601
- No, it's not. No way does
wonder work its way into it.

1282
01:23:02,601 --> 01:23:05,834
- Billy isn't even Scot's dad.
- Oh, I know all that.

1283
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:08,067
But Billy says he'll be
thrilled to have a new mom.

1284
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:12,100
That's 'cause Billy's a moron.

1285
01:23:14,968 --> 01:23:16,634
- Mia, can I--?
- Why you gotta be like that?

1286
01:23:16,634 --> 01:23:19,200
- Why I got to be like that,
right? It's Christmas.

1287
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,634
- Yeah, it's Christmas time.
You're my brother and... and...

1288
01:23:21,634 --> 01:23:23,634
- George, take this
into the dining room.

1289
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:25,284
Yeah, sure.

1290
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:26,934
Hold on.
Sam's in there with Billy.

1291
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:30,467
- Who's Billy?
- He's the goof-bag taking Scot.

1292
01:23:30,467 --> 01:23:34,968
Hi. I'm Mia. I'm with Billy.

1293
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:39,067
The aforementioned "goof-bag".

1294
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,968
- So now you're going to
surprise Scot with a new mommy?

1295
01:23:41,968 --> 01:23:44,801
A surprise is
a computer or a bike.

1296
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:46,801
I mean, you'd be pushing
it to hand the kid a puppy.

1297
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:49,667
For Christ's sake, why didn't you get
a on a plane the minute I called you?

1298
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:53,300
I did! Okay, I was gonna.

1299
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,601
Sammy, look, I had to find a way
to... to work around the...

1300
01:23:57,601 --> 01:24:00,200
The Mia
thing, right?

1301
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,334
I had to, you know, kind of
step up to her level, you know?

1302
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:05,601
- You mean with Julie's
money from the insurance?

1303
01:24:05,601 --> 01:24:07,601
- Oh, now you... don't do that.
You're my brother, alright.

1304
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:09,601
But don't get all preachy...

1305
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:11,467
Dinner's ready now.

1306
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,334
I know. I know. But
George, George, George...

1307
01:24:13,334 --> 01:24:14,834
Sam...

1308
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:16,334
Yeah, I really
need to chill out, right?

1309
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,334
- Alright, you guys...
You guys are lucky.

1310
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:20,183
You missed it.
Apparently, we're lucky.

1311
01:24:20,184 --> 01:24:22,033
Lucky how?

1312
01:24:22,033 --> 01:24:25,834
You're gay.

1313
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:29,834
You can't have kids.
- And that's lucky because...?

1314
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,834
- 'Cause you're not gonna get
stuck with somebody else's kid

1315
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:33,834
then have to pay for it
for the rest of your life.

1316
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:36,434
Billy, you've never let yourself get
stuck with anything in your whole life.

1317
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:38,233
You abandoned Scot and Julie.

1318
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:40,033
Whoa I didn't abandon
anybody. She started using again.

1319
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:43,834
- You ever try
and help her stop?

1320
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:46,300
You know, look...

1321
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,634
I wasn't gonna
get involved, Sammy.

1322
01:24:48,634 --> 01:24:51,234
All I kept thinking
about was like

1323
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:54,868
wouldn't that be weird. Me being the
one in the family to get the AIDS.

1324
01:24:54,868 --> 01:24:57,734
What did you say?

1325
01:25:00,901 --> 01:25:02,567
Whoa! Sam, Sammy, Sam...

1326
01:25:02,568 --> 01:25:04,234
- You know what? I'm not--
- Boys. Boys...

1327
01:25:04,234 --> 01:25:06,701
- Boys, you might want to stop
that just for a bit.

1328
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:11,200
If everybody wants
to come to the hallway.

1329
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,200
<i>- ## We wish you
a merry Christmas #</i>

1330
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,734
# We wish you

1331
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:19,834
# We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year #

1332
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:23,267
# Deck the halls
with boughs of holly #

1333
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:25,534
# Fa la la la la la la la la #

1334
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:30,100
# Jingle bells / Jingle
bells / Jingle all the way #

1335
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,733
Hey!

1336
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:35,367
# Oh what fun it is to ride in a one
-horse open sleigh #

1337
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:38,234
# Jingle bells / Jingle bells #

1338
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:39,967
# Jingle all the way #

1339
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,701
Hey!
# Oh what fun it is to ride #

1340
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:46,167
# In a one-horse open sleigh #

1341
01:25:49,234 --> 01:25:55,534
# The most wonderful
time of the year #

1342
01:25:55,534 --> 01:26:00,000
# With kids jingle-belling
and everyone telling to #

1343
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,434
# "Be of good cheer" #

1344
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:08,934
# It's the most
wonderful time of the year #

1345
01:26:11,501 --> 01:26:14,234
# It's the most... ##

1346
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:31,634
<i>- Yeah um... This is...
This is Mia, Scot.</i>

1347
01:26:31,634 --> 01:26:35,167
She's going to be your new mom.
- Hi.

1348
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:40,501
- You didn't notice
how much I grew.

1349
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:44,834
- What?
- This morning. I asked.

1350
01:26:44,834 --> 01:26:48,267
- What?
- I grew a lot.

1351
01:26:48,267 --> 01:26:51,834
- Yeah, kids grow.
You grew. It's good.

1352
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,834
You didn't notice.

1353
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:58,167
I would.

1354
01:27:04,834 --> 01:27:08,968
'Cause you're gonna grow a lot.
You're gonna get taller

1355
01:27:08,968 --> 01:27:12,200
and your voice is gonna change
and your face is gonna change.

1356
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,534
It'll all be amazingly different. But it'll
all happen so slowly you won't even notice.

1357
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:20,968
But I'd notice.

1358
01:27:20,968 --> 01:27:23,667
I'd notice you.

1359
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:26,701
Every day I'd
notice you.

1360
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,400
- I want to stay
with Eric and Sam.

1361
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:43,567
Billy?

1362
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:46,968
- No. No,
no Eric and Sam.

1363
01:27:46,968 --> 01:27:50,200
Don't start that, okay? I spend a lot of
money on a ticket to fly up here to get you--

1364
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,200
- Billy.
- Hang on. And...

1365
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,968
And, Mia, I've been telling
Mia, and she even likes you.

1366
01:27:54,968 --> 01:27:57,901
Of course. I do.

1367
01:27:57,901 --> 01:28:01,567
But um, Scot
belongs here, Billy.

1368
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
I'm the hose bag?

1369
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,501
Dickhead is more like it.

1370
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,434
Does this mean I can stay?

1371
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:35,601
Yeah. Okay.

1372
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,901
Come here.

1373
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:54,701
- Ow.
- Ow.

1374
01:28:54,701 --> 01:29:00,100
What the hell?

1375
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,634
This is from Mildred. I forgot.

1376
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:05,534
Oh!

1377
01:29:05,534 --> 01:29:08,767
It's my mom's
charm bracelet.

1378
01:29:08,767 --> 01:29:10,767
And, look, it has a new one.

1379
01:29:12,801 --> 01:29:16,334
Scot. One 'T'.

1380
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:32,667
Ta da!
