Temperature-wise, pretty cold.
Uh, six, seven degrees...
which is, uh 
what is it in Fahrenheit?
I don't know. Forty-something?
If anybody has a nice formula,
then they can write in and tell me, after this...
so I know how to transform
Fahrenheit into centigrade 
Dropping lines to the program...
I have to say, uh, a big thank you to, uh 
...the dirty protest and the blanket
protest, which has been going on for years...
all in support of the same demand:
political status.
That is to say, different treatment...
for people who commit crimes 
hideous crimes
for what they... claim
to be a political motive.
And that is what the government
will not grant.
About an hour later, there's a bit of thumping
and banging coming from the granny's room.
So the da walks up to the granny's room,
and he opens the door...
and there's a wee fella having a go at the granny.
And the wee fella turns round and goes,
"See? It's not so fucking funny when it's your ma!"
There is no such thing as political murder...
political bombing or political violence.
There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.
We will not compromise on this.
There will be no political status.
I will not wear the uniform of a criminal.
I demand to wear me own clothes.
What?
What is it your surname is again?
- Gillen.
- Gillen.
Aye.
Fancy Quinn?
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do you know him?
- No.
- No?
- How long did you get?
- Twelve years.
You?
Six years. Six.
Six?
Aye.
You lucky bastard.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- How's Ma?
It's by a former political adviser to Mervyn Rees
when he was at the Home Office...
Roger Darlington.
He rejects the official line on phone taps...
that there's only been
a modest overall increase...
and says Parliament has no way of knowing
how much tapping goes on...
because the prime minister
and other senior ministers...
don't even have to get warrants
to get a tap put into effect.
What?
Get ready.
Fuck!
She sends her very, very best to you.
Are you all right, Bobby?
I'm grand, Ma.
Are they giving you treatment for that?
It's being looked after.
And the young fella?
He's a handful. I'll tell you that.
- Are you eating all right?
- I'm grand, Ma.
- Are they feeding you all right?
- Don't yous be worrying about me.
Five minutes.
- You eating all right?
- Aye.
- Tastes like shit though, doesn't it?
- You get used to it.
You're looking well.
So are you, Son. So are you.
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous...
and his ears are attentive to their cries.
The face of the Lord
is against those who do evil.
The righteous cry out,
and the Lord hears them.
He delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted...
and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
The righteous man has many troubles...
but the Lord delivers him from them all.
He protects all his bones...
and not one of them will be broken.
Evil will slay the wicked.
The foes of the righteous
will be condemned.
The Lord redeems his servants.
No one will be condemned
who finds refuge in him.
Let us pray.
Fucking shoes matches the wall.
- Fucking dirty bastards!
- Fucking bastards!
Fucking dirty bastards!
Fucking bullshit!
Bastards!
I  I ” I.R.A.!
I  I ” I.R.A.! I ” I ”
Fucking bastards!
Everything in order?
- Yes, sir. In order, sir.
- Very good.
Gerry! Gerry!
Gerry!
Get the fuck off me!
Shit. Shit!
Don't kill me!
You bastards, you!
Get off me, you bastards! Off me!
You'll be fuckin' dead for this!
Fuckin' 
Tea with two sugars, please.
Oh. I'll get it for you. Just a minute.
Hi, Mum.
What are you doing sitting in here?
Daisies.
You can sit down anytime you like.
Priest etiquette. Never sit before you're asked.
- Sit down then.
- Don't want to come over too eager.
What, best to hover at the door?
You learn that
your first week in the seminary, Bobby.
Cig?
Come on.
Bit of a break from smoking the Bible, eh?
Oh, aye.
Anyone work out which book is the best smoke?
We only smoke the Lamentations.
A right miserable cigarette.
Nice room.
Very clean.
- Where is it you're from again, Dom?
- Born, you mean?
- Bally-go-backwards?
- Oh, the city dog.
- Ballyroberts.
- A wee place south of Ballymoney. Kilrea.
I remember a homily
you did at mass one time.
Oh, will you listen to it?
- Sure, the men hold you in very high esteem.
- I can feel a dig coming on.
- You're very quick.
- Right.
Nah, you're respected. You know that.
But I like those stories
you tell about the countryside.
A childhood of poaching, robbing apples...
stampeding cattle.
- Fine education for a priest.
- A priest working in West Belfast, it is, yeah.
Stampeding comes in handy
down the Falls Road.
- R.U.C. hate me.
- You miss it though.
- What?
- Countryside.
Ah, sure. I get home to see
my wee brother every month or so, but, uh...
aye, I miss the usual 
clean air, space ” all that.
- Feels closer to who you are.
- Aye. Well, it is.
No question.
Something like a fish out of water
working in a big city like Belfast, but, uh...
it's a job, isn't it?
You stop looking around
at your surroundings quick enough...
when you figure your business
is the business of the soul and all.
- Business of the soul?
- Ah, you know what I mean.
- Learn that in the seminary too?
- Aye. And you can use that free of charge.
Go on.
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is...
you get on.
Kilrea can wait till I'm an old man.
Too many scoundrels
to be saved in Belfast anyway.
- Busy work. Aye.
- Sure, God will reward you in heaven.
And I'll be thankful,
once there's wine involved.
So what's your wee brother
do back home?
He's a parish priest.
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.
- Still goes poachin'?
- Poachin' jobs.
And he's younger than me
by eight years, all right.
Go on.
Ah, as a cleric, I work in a parish
beside Kilrea  wee hole of a place.
I'm workin' me arse off.
House calls to the elderly,
mobile confessions.
- The glamour stuff.
- Oh, aye.
- So, anyway, a position comes up in Kilrea 
- Right.
and I'm passed over for some reason or other 
no reason probably.
- Takin' too much cake off the old ladies.
- Probably.
So?
So, about five years later, position again
comes up back home in Kilrea.
And my brother Michael
waltzes right into it.
Fuck.
He's made parish priest at 28.
More spiritual probably.
Less lippy than you.
He worked the bishop. He's a golfer.
He's a pushy little twerp is what he is.
- At least you're not bitter.
- Oh, no. I couldn't be that, no.
Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.
Mmm. He has two cars.
And the house he has is massive.
He has a maid, a cook.
I'm stuck in a two-up two-down...
with a fat Kerry man who drones on and on
about Gaelic football.
- Can we stop talkin' about this?
- Jesus. You're the one who's talkin'.
Mmm.
- How's your smoke goin'?
- Grand.
- Mmm. Filthy habit. Disgusting.
- Oh, aye. Awful.
- Lovely though.
- Aye. Praise the Lord.
- Twenty-eight. My God.
- Oh, stop it.
- So, what happened to your eye, Bobby?
- What?
- Did you get a dig for yourself? Your eye.
- Difference of opinion.
Mmm. How's the other fella?
Oh, a lot worse. Believe me.
- So, what did you call me here for?
- What, is that the idle banter over with?
Priest etiquette 
start with the small talk.
I'm learning a lot
about the priesthood, Dom.
- Mmm. You'd make a fine priest.
- Oh, aye.
Good talker. A man of principal.
Leader of men.
Political terrorist.
- The church loves a reformed crook.
- Aye.
I always felt that thief next to Jesus
got off lightly.
Ah, but he recognized his sins.
- Did he though?
- Aye. Said as much.
When you're hung from a cross,
you're gonna say anything.
Jesus offers him a seat next to his daddy
in a place called paradise...
you're always gonna put your hand up
and have a piece of that.
Aye. Even when it's nailed to your cross.
Jesus Christ.
- That's sacrilegious.
- Sacrilegious?
- Aye.
- No, no, no. He was a dirty thief.
So, what did you want to tell me?
Where are you at?
Been driven mad by that governor yet?
See, this negotiating lark 
it's been a sideshow.
- I'll tell you that for nothin'.
- But you understand why you need to do it?
Because we're no longer good propaganda.
According to who  the leadership?
Time has come.
A decision had to be made.
You think that's what the leadership think?
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Bit paranoid there, Bobby.
- 10,000 people marched for the seven hunger strikers last October, right?
- Right.
- International pressure on the Brits and all that.
- Busy time.
Even the pope's having a say,
getting involved.
The whole world trying to get Maggie Thatcher
to back down, give us our demands.
- But it all came to nothin'.
- Right.
Hunger strike failed.
We're on the front line.
We created the protest.
It's our responsibility.
Leadership have been
very clear to me, Dom.
Four and a half years
of the "no wash" protest...
as much as it's highlighted
republicanism to some extent...
it's also distracted from the wider
development of the organization.
That's because your needs
are specific needs.
Of course they are.
Some woman bringing up
three children in West Belfast...
shouldn't care about civilian-type clothing...
- or whatever the fuck they're calling these clown outfits.
- I saw them.
Honest to God, Dom,
we were promised our own clothes.
It's childish skulduggery.
So the leadership
have had enough of you?
In the ideal world, we'd be fighting our battles
independently, but we're tied.
Nothing's changed in here.
Nothing's moved on.
The leadership are stuck with us...
until there's some realistic chance
of movement towards political status.
That's the hard truth of it.
See, to get me to negotiate
with these lying, reneging monkeys...
when there's never nothin' on the table,
it's just pure crap.
I'm not going to be marched
into this governor's office...
and get caught up in some mindless,
pointless dialogue with that pompous bastard.
- Well, he's a big fan of yours.
- Thick as two short planks, Dom. A moron.
Can you believe they made him governor?
It's a bloody insult to humanity.
Mother of Jesus,
where do you get your energy from?
I was a cross-country runner as a boy.
I could have guessed it.
Big engine on you.
Cross-country running.
Explains a lot about you, Bobby.
Why, I loved it. So I did.
That's the whole country thing for me.
Jesus, they'd have to hold me back
at the finishing line, or I'd keep on running.
Little scraps.
We were mongrels from out of the city.
Frightened of cattle and all.
It was a funny time.
- Frightened of cattle?
- Oh, aye, terrified of them.
Think you could get milk and burgers
from them monsters? Jesus Christ.
The next time round,
I'll be born in countryside, guaranteed.
Wildlife, birds.
I love all that  paradise.
Aye, and you could learn to relax too.
Aye. Maybe. You never know.
Never tried it before.
I'm starting a hunger strike
on the first of March.
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling you.
Aye. I heard that.
- Does your family know?
- I got word out to them, aye.
- Have you spoken with them?
- Got a visit in two weeks' time.
- We'll talk then.
- How do you think they'll take it?
What do you think, Dom?
And your wee boy?
So, what makes it different
from the last time?
Last hunger strike was flawed.
It became emotional.
Seven men started at the same time.
They all got weak,
and they couldn't let the weakest one die...
which left us susceptible
to being conned by the Brits.
And that's exactly what we were  conned.
This time out, the men will start
consecutively, two weeks apart.
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.
There's no shortage of us.
- Seventy-five men have put their names forward.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
The announcement's being made today.
So what makes this protest different
is that you're set to die, Bobby?
It may well come to that.
You start a hunger strike
to protest for what you believe in.
You don't start already determined to die.
Or am I missing something here?
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing our determination.
So it'll take a couple of deaths,
do you think? Maybe five or six?
But sure, there's 75 of you.
Aye. Well, it won't come to that.
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle
after 20 or so.
But why should you care,
'cause you're already dead, right?
Have you thought about what you're going
to be putting these boys through?
I mean, putting aside what's gonna happen
to these poor men's families.
You're going head-to-head
with a British government...
that clearly despise republicanism,
who are unshakable...
who can easily live with the deaths
of what they call terrorists.
- And the stakes are much higher this time.
- I know that.
And if you're not even willing to negotiate,
you're looking for them to capitulate.
- Is that it?
- Right.
So failure means many dead men,
families torn apart...
and the whole republican movement
demoralized.
Aye.
Worst case scenario,
it might well mean all that.
- But short term  out of the ashes.
- Come on.
Guaranteed, there'll be a new generation
of men and women...
even more resilient, more determined.
- Look who you're talking to.
- There's a war going on.
I thought you might understand.
You're talking like a foreigner.
You're talking to me like I'm a foreigner. You think
I don't know Northern Ireland? I live here, man.
- Then support us.
- I supported the first hunger strike...
on the basis it was a protest...
not some "predesigned to die
and balk at negotiation...
other than complete
surrender from Thatcher."
That's ridiculous, Bobby.
It's destructive.
What-What's happening here
for the last four years?
The brutality, humiliation, our basic
human rights taken away from us.
- All of this has to come to an end.
- Through talking.
So, what? We take their offer
and put their uniform on...
'cause the last four years
have meant nothing?
We could do that, Dom, or we could
behave like the army we proclaim to be...
and lay down our lives for our comrades.
Is there not even a small part of you
that's hoping for a breakthrough...
that-that could find you negotiating again?
- That won't happen.
- Right, forget about that.
I want to know whether your intent
is just purely to commit suicide here.
You want me to argue about the morality
of what I'm about to do...
and whether it's really suicide or not?
For one, you're calling it suicide.
I call it murder.
And that's just another wee difference
between us two.
We're both Catholic men,
both republicans.
But while you were poaching salmon
in lovely Kilrea...
we were being burnt out
of our house in Rathcoole.
Similar in many ways, Dom, but life and
experiences focused our beliefs differently.
- You understand me?
- I understand.
I have my belief. And, in all its simplicity,
that is a most powerful thing.
So what's your statement by dying?
Just highlighting British intransigence?
So fucking what? The whole world
knows what the Brits are like.
- Good.
- Aye, it is good, and it's nothing to do with you.
The Brits have been fucking up
everything for centuries.
I can feel your hatred, Dom.
- Oh, you're looking for martyrdom?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Aye.
'Cause I've heard you eulogizing Wolfe Tone,
Connolly, MacSwiney  all them men.
I can't help thinking you're writing your name
large for all them history books.
- 'Cause you think that matters to me?
- Oh, aye, I know it does.
Well, you're wrong.
You say you're soldiers.
It's all about the freedom.
But you got no appreciation
of a life, Bobby.
You no longer know
what a life is, you men.
Four years living in these conditions,
no one expects you to be normal.
There's nothing normal about you.
Right now, the republican movement
has talked itself into a corner.
You I.R.A. are standing right behind it
looking into that corner.
All that history, all them dead men and women 
you're still seeing nothing.
When your answer is to kill everything...
you've blinded yourself,
and you're scared to stop it.
Afraid of living.
Afraid of talk and peace.
Sure, what would Ulster be
if wasn't tearing itself to shit?
And this situation here, that the future
of the republican movement...
is in the hands of you men who have lost all 
all sense of reality.
You think your head's on right?
Locked up in here 24 hours a day
in piss and shit...
and you are making decisions
that could see so many men die.
Build a statue to Bobby Sands.
You're joking me.
Freedom fighter?
They're the men and women
working out there in the community.
And that was you once upon a time.
Am I right?
All that work you did in Twinbrook.
That's where we need you, Bobby.
And you know I'm right.
That I'm deluded 
you want me to answer that?
They're beating you, Bobby.
You're playing into their hands.
- The strategy's in place.
- Then stop it. Just say stop.
- You don't understand a thing.
- You're in no shape to make this call.
It's done. It won't be stopped.
Then fuck it.
Life must mean nothing to you.
God's gonna punish me?
Well, if not just for the suicide,
then he'd have to punish you for stupidity.
Aye, and you for your arrogance.
'Cause my life is a real life,
not some theological exercise...
some religious trick
that's got fuck-all to do with living.
Jesus Christ had a backbone.
But, see, them disciples? Every disciple since 
you're just jumping in and out
of the rhetoric and dead-end semantics.
You need the revolutionary...
you need the cultural-political soldier
to give life a pulse, to give life a direction.
- That's stupid talk. You're deluded.
- Aye, so you say.
- Yeah, and what's your wee son gonna say?
- Fuck off.
Doesn't it interest you?
You're gonna attack me with sentiment?
Typical priest.
- What's your heart saying, Bobby?
- I thought you had me all figured out, Dom.
What's it saying? Tell me.
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.
I know you don't mean to mock me, Dom,
so I'll just let all that pass.
This is one of these times
when we've come to a pause.
It's a time to keep your beliefs pure.
I believe that a united Ireland
is right and just.
Maybe it's impossible
for a man like you to understand...
but having a respect for my life,
a desire for freedom...
an unyielding love for that belief...
means I can see past any doubts I may have.
Putting my life on the line
is not just the only thing I can do, Dom.
It's the right thing.
And this is why you've called me here.
Needed a sounding board?
Not a hundred percent sure of yourself?
Been doubting yourself maybe?
Aye. Well, I'm only human.
And I've made it clear for you then?
Man of guidance, Dom.
Business of the soul.
You been to Gweedore in Donegal?
Aye.
I went there when I was 12.
Big cross-country race for the boys...
and we're all in the back of a minibus
headed towards Derry one morning.
I mean, this is big-time.
You know? This is like
international athletics for us...
'cause we're racing against boys in the south,
and we have this thing to do Belfast proud.
Two of the boys are Prods,
and the rest of us are Catholics.
It's a cross-community event.
I suppose the good people in the south
think this is great stuff...
and let's get this wee team over from Belfast
and all that patronizing shite.
Anyway, we're through the border.
The boys are all singing pop tunes and all...
but I'm just in the back of the bus
looking out the window.
We're going through them mountains...
you know, where Mount Errigal is
and everything.
It's a beautiful sight, Dom.
Donegal has to be the most beautiful
place in Ireland, I reckon.
Aye.
Anyway...
we arrive at Gweedore.
What a place.
And it's hopping with about 200 boys...
and they're getting into their gear
and limbering up.
The whole event's run by Christian brothers...
and they're clipping young fellas
around the back of the ears...
basically trying to retain some order.
Our team goes off for a wee jog,
stretch out the legs.
We're surrounded by fields of barley.
And they dip down into a wee valley where
there's a stream and woods runnin' through it.
The woods and stream are out-of-bounds, so
naturally us Belfast boys have to go check 'em out.
Woods and a stream, Dom.
Sure, that's like the Amazon to us.
And we come across
these young fellas from Cork.
There's, uh, some banter about our accents,
but they could barely talk.
We couldn't understand a word
they were saying.
You get the idea that they're lording it over us
a bit, you know, looking down on us.
I'm sensing it anyway.
We're running along,
and we come up with this idea...
to go down to the stream
and check it out for fish.
So we're down by the river, Dom  stream.
It was half a foot of water in there.
Little silver fish but none substantial,
until one of their boys calls us further down.
Lying in the water is a wee foal,
four or five days old.
He's all skin and bone, a gray color.
And he's got flecks of blood on his coat...
'cause he cut himself up really badly
on the sharp rocks.
We're just standing over him,
and you can see his back leg snapped.
And he's breathing.
He's alive, but just about.
So this big conversation gets started up...
between the boys who suddenly
reckon themselves the leaders...
and they're deliberating
as what we should do.
Someone says, "Drop a rock on his head."
But I'm looking in their faces, and I can see
they're either scared stiff or clueless.
It's all bravado.
And this foal on the ground,
in real pain.
All this chitchat going on, going nowhere.
Next thing, one of the priests sees us,
sees the foal...
tells us not to move and we're done for.
I mean we're really done for.
Group of boys will always get the blame
for hurtin' a foal.
Group of Belfast boys
will get a hammerin' for sure.
So it's clear to me in an instant,
and I'm down on my knees...
and I take the foal's head in my hands
and I put him underwater.
He's thrashing around a bit to start,
so I press down harder until he's drowned.
Priest arrives, Dom.
He's grabbing me by the hair,
dragging me through the woods...
promising me a proper hiding.
But I knew I did the right thing
by that wee foal.
And I could take the punishment
for all our boys.
I had the respect of them other boys now,
and I knew that.
I'm clear of the reasons, Dom.
I'm clear of all the repercussions.
But I will act, and I will not stand by
and do nothin'.
You can leave them there if you like.
Don't want me rolling up
the Letters of Saint John, do you?
Couldn't have that on my conscience, no.
I don't think I'm gonna
see you again, Bobby.
There's no need, Dom.
And faced now
with the failure of their discredited cause...
the men of violence
have chosen in recent months...
to play what may well be
their last card.
They have turned their violence
against themselves...
through the prison "hunger strike to death."
They seek to work on the most basic
of human emotions 
pity 
as a means of creating tension...
and stoking the fires
of bitterness and hatred.
And from week one,
there's been a gradual deterioration...
of liver, kidney and pancreatic function.
Also, the bone density decreases substantially
due to calcium and vitamin deficiencies.
The muscle of the heart is also undernourished...
causing impaired function
and, eventually, cardiac failure.
The left ventricle could shrink
to 70% of its normal size.
He will have low blood sugar,
low energy and muscular wasting.
He'll be experiencing gastrointestinal ulcers...
with the thinning of the intestinal wall
and submucosal hemorrhaging.
There will have been degenerative changes
to the mucous membrane of the intestines...
and, indeed, all the organs in the body.
