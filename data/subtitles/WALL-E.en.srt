00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:52,641
EVE.

191
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:28,927
EVE!

192
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,514
I've been in my cabin all morning,

193
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,185
so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.

194
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:39,772
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

195
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:43,651
- Well, then what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Something.

196
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:45,444
Whoa!

197
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:56,205
Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.

198
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:06,131
Bot, over here.

199
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:08,926
Whoa!

200
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:17,893
- I'm in a tunnel. I can't hear you.
- There you are.

201
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,313
Buy N Large.

202
00:40:21,398 --> 00:40:23,482
Everything you need to be happy.

203
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,485
Your day is very important to us.

204
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,029
Hey, drink-bot.

205
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,699
Here, take the cup.
Hey, take the cup!

206
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:33,158
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.

207
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,746
Please remain stationary.

208
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:40,833
A service-bot will be here
to assist you momentarily.

209
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,460

210
00:40:43,545 --> 00:40:45,087
- Please remain stationary.
- Help.

211
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,548

What's that? What's going on?

213
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,139
WALL-E.

214
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:56,682
Uh...

215
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,018
- John.
- EVE?

216
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:01,270
Uh, no. John.

217
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:05,065

218
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:06,609
Bye, WALL-E.

219
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:16,493
"A" is for Axiom,
your home sweet home.

"B" is for Buy N Large,
your very best friend.

Mmm!

222
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,377
Time for lunch in a cup.

223
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:32,801
Feel beautiful.

- You look great.

- Men.

226
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:39,141
Attention, Axiom shoppers.
Try blue.

227
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:40,893
It's the new red.

228
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:42,394
Ooh!

229
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,190
Love blue.

230
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:49,193
Date?

231
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,527
Don't get me started
on the date.

232
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:54,239
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

233
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:59,161
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

234
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:01,080
There are no good men out there.

Huh?

239
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:16,512
Yoo-hoo. WALL-E.

00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:17,596

Well, good morning, everybody,

273
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:05,908
and welcome to day 255,642
aboard the Axiom.

274
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:10,204
As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and...

275
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:14,792
Oh, I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary

276
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,377
of our five-year cruise.

277
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:21,006
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would
be proud to know that 700 years later

278
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:24,802
we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing.

279
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:25,970
Fore!

280
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:29,598

Wow, look at that!

Also today we have a...

285
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:45,572

00:47:19,107 --> 00:47:22,443
Greetings and congratulations,

292
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:23,694
If you are seeing this,

293
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:27,364
that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,

294

or EVE probe, has returned from Earth

295
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,205
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis.

296
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,084
That's right. It means it's time
to go back home.

297
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,087
Home? We're going back?

298
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,674
Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,

00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:49,345
by golly,
we can begin "Operation Re-colonize".

300
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:00,731
Simply follow
this manual's instructions

301
00:48:00,815 --> 00:48:04,026
to place the plant
in your ship's holo-detector

302
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:09,031
and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth.

303
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:10,783
- It's that easy.
- Huh!

304
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:13,661
Now, due to the effects of microgravity,

305
00:48:13,745 --> 00:48:16,330
you and your passengers
may have suffered some

306
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:17,873
slight bone loss.

307
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,878
But I'm sure a few laps
around the ship's jogging track

308
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:25,047
will get you back in shape in no time.

309
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:26,173
We have a jogging track?

310
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:28,050

311
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:31,095
just consult your operation manual.

312
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:33,305
See you back home real soon.

00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:39,144

314
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:41,230

Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

332
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:04,355
Maybe we missed a step.

Why don't you
scan her to be sure?

338
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:28,212
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

339
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:33,050
- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.

340
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:35,427
I guess things go back to normal, huh?

341
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:37,346
Correct, Captain.

342
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,556
- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.

343
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,519
The probe must be defective.

344
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,273

345
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:50,818

00:51:20,974 --> 00:51:23,684
Analysis.
Foreign contaminant.

353
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:25,769
Substance is a three-phase system

354
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:27,855
composed of various combinations
of naturally derived solids.

355
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:33,652
Subject is most commonly
referred to as soil, dirt, or earth.

356
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:34,987
"Earth?"

357
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:36,989
Hmm.

358
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,742
Define: "earth".

359
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:46,582
Earth, the surface of the world

360
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,792
as distinct from the sky or sea.

361
00:51:48,877 --> 00:51:50,294
Wow.

362
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,838
Define: "sea".

363
00:51:54,174 --> 00:51:56,508
Sea, an expanse of salt water

364
00:51:56,593 --> 00:52:00,971
that covers most of the Earth's surface
and surrounds its landmasses.

365
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:12,149
Foreign contaminant.

366
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:13,859
Whoa!

367
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,465

00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:44,181

Ah!

379

WALL-E.

Hey. I know that guy. It's, uh, WALL-E.

01:00:56,257 --> 01:01:00,094
- Hey, WALL-E! It's your buddy John.
- Hi, WALL-E!

Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms".

440
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:34,003
Humans would put seeds
in the ground, pour water on them,

441
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:36,213
and they grow food, like pizza.

442

445
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:51,687
Dancing, a series of
movements involving two partners

446
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:55,441

match harmoniously with music.

The "Lido Deck" is now closing.

Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,114
That's all I've ever done.

554
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:43,492
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

555
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:45,953
On the Axiom you will survive.

556
01:09:46,037 --> 01:09:50,749
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

557
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,353
I'm the captain of the Axiom.

558
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:14,106
We are going home today.

559
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:20,946
GO-4?

560
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:23,699
Hey! That's not...

561
01:10:23,783 --> 01:10:26,410
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

562
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:36,503
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

563
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,213
No!

564
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:49,516
Huh?

565
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:53,729
- EVE?
- WALL-E!

566
01:10:53,813 --> 01:10:55,481
EVE!

567
01:10:57,067 --> 01:10:58,317
- Oh!
- WALL-E, the plant!

568
01:10:58,401 --> 01:10:59,818
- WALL-E!
- Over here. Throw it.

569
01:10:59,903 --> 01:11:00,903
Ahhh!

570
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:02,237
EVE!

571
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,032
Give me the plant.

572
01:11:21,508 --> 01:11:23,258
WALL-E!

573
01:11:33,353 --> 01:11:35,646
All communications are terminated.

574
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,439
You are confined to quarters.

575
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:38,857
No! Mutiny!

576
01:11:39,317 --> 01:11:40,484
Mutiny!

577
01:11:59,879 --> 01:12:00,838
WALL-E?

578
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:03,966
Caution.
Activating airlock disposal.

579
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,926
WALL-E!

580
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:09,054
Activating airlock disposal.

581
01:12:15,353 --> 01:12:16,562
WALL-E?

582
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:26,322
Ah!

583
01:12:43,757 --> 01:12:46,133
EVE.

584
01:12:46,217 --> 01:12:47,426
WALL-E!

585
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:51,597
Caution.
Activating airlock disposal.

586
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:54,683
Activating airlock disposal.

587
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:01,774
WALL-E!

588
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:09,114
Foreign contaminant.

589
01:13:09,741 --> 01:13:10,824
Whoa!

590
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:35,891
Whoa.

591
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:45,734
WALL-E.

592
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:05,129
Huh?

593
01:14:14,848 --> 01:14:16,265
All clean. All clean.

594
01:14:21,563 --> 01:14:23,522
WALL-E.

595
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:27,151
M-O.

596
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:33,073
- M-O?
- M-O.

597
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:35,784
M-O.

598
01:14:37,704 --> 01:14:38,704
Mmm?

599
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:40,372
Mmm.

600
01:14:46,212 --> 01:14:49,006
Directive.

601
01:15:03,396 --> 01:15:04,897
Directive.

602
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:26,293
Earth.

603
01:15:29,547 --> 01:15:32,883
- Earth.
- Earth.

604
01:15:39,057 --> 01:15:40,641
Earth? Earth!

605
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:44,311
- M-O.
- WALL-E!

606
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:04,456
Wrong.

607
01:16:18,638 --> 01:16:20,306
Please hold.
We are currently having...

608
01:16:20,807 --> 01:16:21,807
EVE!

609
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:22,891
Whoops.

610
01:16:22,976 --> 01:16:25,060
Caution. Rogue robots.

611
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:38,824
That style suits you.

612
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:45,164
Clear.

613
01:16:51,046 --> 01:16:53,255
Caution. Rogue robots.

614
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,800
Caution. Rogue robots.

615
01:16:58,011 --> 01:17:00,346
- Not possible.
- Caution. Rogue robots.

616
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:13,984
Auto! Auto!

617
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:15,945
Mutiny. Mutiny.

618
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:19,031
Stupid wheel.

619
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:21,367
Caution. Rogue robots.

620
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:26,455
Caution. Rogue robots.

621
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:27,498
The plant!

622
01:17:31,753 --> 01:17:33,754
We'll see who's powerless now.

623
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:42,221
Testing, testing.
Is this thing on?

624
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:47,726
This is the captain.
I am locked in my room.

625
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:51,355
EVE, WALL-E,
bring the plant to the "Lido Deck".

626
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,817
I'll have activated the holo-detector.
Now, hurry.

627
01:17:54,901 --> 01:17:57,653
- Auto's probably going to cut me off...
- Halt.

628
01:17:58,321 --> 01:17:59,321
Ah!

629
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:02,074
Halt.

630
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,659
Oh, my.

631
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:06,328
Clear.

632
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:09,081
Oh!

633
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:12,418
Halt, halt.

634
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:23,429
- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.

635
01:18:23,513 --> 01:18:27,057
That's right. The plant.

636
01:18:27,142 --> 01:18:29,935
You want it? Come and get it, blinky.

637
01:18:30,812 --> 01:18:31,854
No.

638
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,611
Captain? Captain?

639
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:43,782
Let go.

640
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:46,744
- Let go.
- Too heavy for you? Huh?

641
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,247
Get off.

642
01:18:50,332 --> 01:18:52,041
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

643
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:54,084
- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

644
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:09,350
Halt.

645
01:19:13,146 --> 01:19:14,897
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

646
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:16,941
- Not good.
- Got you.

647
01:19:42,384 --> 01:19:43,676
Whoa!

648
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:56,689
Remain calm. Remain calm.

649
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:10,244
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

650
01:20:10,328 --> 01:20:13,998
We're having a slight malfunction
with the autopilot.

651
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:15,791
Please remain calm.

652
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:20,796
Ah!

653
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:24,883
Enough.

654
01:20:30,515 --> 01:20:32,099
Hey. What? John?

655
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:33,976
Whoa!

656
01:20:51,494 --> 01:20:52,911
No! No, no, no!

657
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:00,294
I gotcha!

658
01:21:03,882 --> 01:21:06,300
John, get ready to have some kids!

659
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:21,607
- Look out!
- Ah!

660
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:33,035
Oh!

661
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:41,961
No.

662
01:21:47,676 --> 01:21:49,134

663
01:21:59,187 --> 01:22:00,229
No!

664
01:22:01,815 --> 01:22:02,815
Uh-oh.

665
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:06,402
Oh, no!

666
01:22:31,303 --> 01:22:32,386
Auto?

667
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,559
WALL-E!

668
01:22:48,236 --> 01:22:50,321
Auto, you are relieved of duty.

669
01:22:52,657 --> 01:22:54,825
No.

670
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:07,254
Plant! Plant!

671
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:17,389
Foreign contaminant.

672
01:23:18,975 --> 01:23:20,726
