1
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,095
Game over.

2
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,330
I'll fucking kill you!

3
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,737
You fucking bitch!

4
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:47,776
I'll fucking kill you!

5
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,715
No!

6
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:19,238
Daniel!

7
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:18,094
- Secure the back.
- Left side clear.

8
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,434
This side clear.
Let's move.

9
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:37,441
Oh my God.

10
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,347
Someone call Kerry.

11
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,989
Call came in at 11 :45.
A woman heard an explosion.

12
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:46,723
The fire department
was first on the scene.

13
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,094
Kerry, before you go in there--

14
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,157
Is it him?

15
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,464
Eric... is it him?

16
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:53,730
We don't know yet.

17
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,438
It's not Detective Matthews.

18
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,659
What happened?

19
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,860
The victim was held in place
by these chains.

20
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,899
Hello, Troy.

21
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,305
I wanna play a game.

22
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:09,441
This game will take place
in a room

23
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:11,042
not much bigger
than the room

24
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,486
you've spent
most of your life in--

25
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,010
a prison cell.

26
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:18,048
Despite all of the advantages
and privileges

27
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,685
that you were given at birth,

28
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:22,822
you have returned
to prison again and again.

29
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:24,856
More comfortable in chains

30
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,232
than you are in freedom.

31
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,897
Tonight, we will see how far
you are willing to go

32
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,499
to break those chains
once and for all.

33
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,940
Live or die, Troy?

34
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,968
Make your choice.

35
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:57,661
This was the bomb.

36
00:07:57,702 --> 00:07:59,727
All he had to do

37
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,864
was release himself
from each of the chains.

38
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,539
Walk out the door

39
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,568
before it went off.

40
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,139
All he had to do?

41
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,494
Oh, God!

42
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,864
Fuck!

43
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,558
I really had this feeling
it was gonna be him.

44
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,583
Kerry...

45
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:00,893
Eric is a missing person case,
not a homicide case.

46
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,132
I've been having
nightmares where l...

47
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,761
I see him.

48
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:14,342
I'm never gonna be able to forgive
myself for what happened.

49
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,177
Listen,

50
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,877
- It's not your fault.
- It's always somebody's fault, Rigg.

51
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,408
But that somebody isn't you.

52
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,282
That someone is still out there.

53
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,188
So put all your anger into finding them
and putting them away.

54
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,519
What I don't understand is...

55
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,523
how the hell
could Jigsaw do all of this?

56
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,159
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

57
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,268
I'm not so sure he did.

58
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,432
So far, this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

59
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,067
Meaning?

60
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,907
Well...

61
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,709
how'd you get in here?

62
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,338
- We cut the door down.
- Why?

63
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,578
'Cause somebody
heard an explosion and called us.

64
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:54,817
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

65
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,651
It was welded shut.

66
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,124
Bloody truck
couldn't get in here.

67
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,490
Exactly.

68
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,496
I don't follow.

69
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,928
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was
to get out before the bomb went off

70
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,829
then why was the door
welded shut?

71
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,234
The guy couldn't get out
if he wanted to.

72
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,467
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

73
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:07,193
Hello, Troy.
I wanna play a game.

74
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,369
Live or die, Troy?

75
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,461
Make your choice.

76
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,497
Hello, Kerry.

77
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:16,091
I want to play a game.

78
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,502
Up until now,
you have spent your life

79
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,133
among the dead piecing together
their final moments.

80
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:25,632
You're good at this
because you, like them,

81
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,975
are also dead.

82
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,642
Dead on the inside.

83
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:33,743
You identify more
with a cold corpse

84
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:36,154
than you do
with a living human.

85
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,420
I believe you want
to join your true family--

86
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,586
indeed, your only family--

87
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,756
in death.

88
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,593
The device you are wearing

89
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,192
is hooked into your ribcage

90
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,295
and by the time
this tape is finished,

91
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,201
you will have one minute

92
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:54,105
to find a way out.

93
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,509
At the end of that minute--

94
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,306
you should know
better than anyone

95
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:00,371
what happens then.

96
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,746
There is a single key

97
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,581
that will unlock
the harness, Kerry.

98
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,312
It is right in front of you.

99
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:06,911
All you have to do

100
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,788
is reach in and take it.

101
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:12,054
But do it quickly.

102
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:14,528
The acid
will dissolve the key

103
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,554
in a matter of seconds.

104
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,357
Make your choice.

105
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:41,545
No!

106
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,701
You.

107
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,836
I gotta be
at the hospital by 9:00.

108
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,980
It's Tuesday.
Thought you start at 11:00.

109
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,849
Yeah, well,

110
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,115
they changed
things on me last minute.

111
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:47,147
Well, you'd better head off then.

112
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:55,630
Not gonna take a shower?

113
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,726
Nah.

114
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,431
I'm just gonna take a shower
at the hospital.

115
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,475
Can we just...

116
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:07,104
talk for five minutes?

117
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,738
Okay, how about
we just make eye contact

118
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,271
for five seconds?

119
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:13,944
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, just...

120
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:16,682
everything.

121
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:22,726
- Lynn.
- What is it you want from me, Chris?

122
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:25,689
A divorce.

123
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,632
MVA.

124
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:39,306
Car skidded into oncoming traffic.

125
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:43,078
- Pressure?
- 80 over pulse-- pulse is thready.

126
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,915
Ready?
One, two, three.

127
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:48,218
- Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.

128
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:49,722
- Set up an art line.
- Dr. Lynn Denlon,

129
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,122
please report
to Trauma immediately.

130
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:54,490
Dr. Lynn Denlon, please report
to Trauma immediately.

131
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,895
Lynn?

132
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,897
- Pressure's dropping rapidly.
- Pressure down to 70.

133
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,837
He's going into shock.

134
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:06,137
Get an OR ready.
We've gotta crack his chest.

135
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,697
Can we get a bolus 500
wide open?

136
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,539
No.

137
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:11,903
What?

138
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,280
- No air entry on the right side.
- And?

139
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,787
It's not blood loss,
it's tension pneumo.

140
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,812
- Let's get a chest tube in him.
- We've gotta get him to OR now.

141
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,050
His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.

142
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,958
I'm doing it.

143
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,673
I'm getting a rush of air.

144
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,143
Stats are improving.

145
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,874
Pressure back to 80.

146
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,905
Pressure normal.

147
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,227
Look, if you've got something
on your mind, go upstairs to Psych.

148
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:07,706
Just don't bring it in here. We don't
have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

149
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,335
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged from the locker room

150
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,345
to put a chest tube
in a trauma patient?

151
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,348
Lynn Denlon should have been
the first one there.

152
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,978
Lynn!

153
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,614
Lynn!

154
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,388
What the hell?

155
00:20:58,426 --> 00:20:59,586
I'm locked in.

156
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,653
Is anybody there?

157
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:02,994
Hello?

158
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,263
Anybody here?

159
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,623
What is this?

160
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:39,029
Help!
Help me!

161
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,935
Help!

162
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,171
Who are you?
Who are you?

163
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,737
What is this?

164
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,212
What are you doing?

165
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,617
Are you gonna behave?

166
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:15,396
Let's go.

167
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:20,208
What is this place?
What is this place?

168
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,612
What is--
What is--

169
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,278
What--

170
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:41,631
Who are you?
Who are you?

171
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:47,861
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

172
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:50,432
You may not remember me,

173
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:52,772
but I most certainly
remember you.

174
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:55,970
I was a guest...

175
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,914
at your hospital once.

176
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:03,216
Where am l?

177
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:07,792
Do you remember me?

178
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,363
I've seen you on television.

179
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,835
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

180
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:26,402
I was his patient and he was mine.

181
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:29,642
As you can see from that report,

182
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,652
my prognosis isn't good.

183
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,684
Would you agree?

184
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:45,294
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

185
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,732
I remember you
saying that to me once before

186
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:51,296
in almost
that exact same tone.

187
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:54,273
Leave it to a doctor
to find such a cold, clinical way

188
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,710
of saying
I'm a dead man walking.

189
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:00,511
Looking at me,
how long would you say I have left?

190
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:02,517
I'd have to examine you.

191
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,317
Even then, a frontal lobe tumor
is unpredictable.

192
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,324
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis.

193
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,883
I'm sorry, but is all this

194
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,520
crude medical equipment around me

195
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:18,091
causing you to believe
that you're still inside a hospital?

196
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:20,194
No.

197
00:25:20,237 --> 00:25:24,263
Then why are you speaking to me
in that graduate school medical jargon?

198
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:28,308
Look at me!

199
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,079
Now you look at me.

200
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,677
I asked you a simple question.

201
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,549
Based on your experience,

202
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:40,182
how long
do you think I have left?

203
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:42,418
It's not a simple answer.

204
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,451
Based on your file,
I'd say...

205
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,526
not long.

206
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,041
Death is a surprise party.
Unless, of course...

207
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,969
you're already dead
on the inside.

208
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,615
Unless you're the type of person
who swallows

209
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:12,625
anti-depressants to hide the pain,

210
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,595
or turns their back on their husband,

211
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:17,857
neglects their child,

212
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:19,922
who has every possible
advantage in life

213
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,834
but chooses not to advance.

214
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,563
What do you want from me?

215
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:27,906
What do I want?

216
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:31,399
I wanna play a game.

217
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:37,007
The rules of the game are simple.

218
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,678
Consequences
for breaking them are great.

219
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,883
Death.

220
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:48,496
You are being tested.
Your will is being tested.

221
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,465
Your will to keep someone alive.

222
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:53,661
Can you do that?
Can you follow the rules

223
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:55,363
- and grant someone the gift of life?
- What is this? What is this?

224
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:57,395
No! Get it--

225
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:00,935
No! What is this?

226
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:02,671
What are you doing to me?

227
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:13,109
The device that you're wearing
is linked to my heart rate monitor.

228
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:16,056
The second
that heart rate monitor flatlines

229
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,062
or you move out of range,

230
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,962
an explosion will go off
in that collar.

231
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:23,659
Your life, and my life,

232
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,430
will end simultaneously.

233
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:28,763
Please...
please don't do this to me.

234
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,707
I have a family.
I have a family.

235
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:34,209
Let me give you
the simple version.

236
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,608
You will keep him alive

237
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:39,378
whatever it takes.

238
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,942
No excuses,

239
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:44,011
no equivocations.

240
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:46,251
No crying.

241
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,758
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

242
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:53,666
Out there, on those screens,

243
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,395
we have another test subject.

244
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,528
A man.

245
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:03,797
He will face a series of tests.

246
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:07,838
You have to keep John alive

247
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,781
until he makes it through.

248
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:13,082
If he completes all of his tests

249
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,643
and John is still breathing,

250
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,849
then I will remove your collar...

251
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:21,121
and you're free to go.

252
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:24,893
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

253
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,731
A critical part
of what could be my final test.

254
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:34,435
Amanda, it's time to start our game.

255
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,276
Help!

256
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:14,776
Hello?

257
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,152
Is there anybody out there?

258
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,757
Hello, Jeff.

259
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,565
Over the past few years
you have become

260
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,765
a shell of your former self,

261
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:39,607
consumed with hatred
and vengeance.

262
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:43,081
Vengeance against the drunk driver
who killed your only son.

263
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,445
Vengeance against the killer,

264
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:48,111
who to your
surprise and dismay,

265
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,985
was set free,
after a hasty trial.

266
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:55,255
Today, however, it is you

267
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,525
who will be put on trial.

268
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,462
To escape from where you are,

269
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,023
you will have to face
a series of tests.

270
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,899
You will have to suffer

271
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,665
to move forward
through each of them.

272
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,639
But with each one,

273
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,837
you will also have a chance--

274
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:13,208
a chance to forgive.

275
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,578
When you compete the tests,

276
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:18,949
I promise you, you will finally
come face to face

277
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,148
with the man responsible
for the loss of your child.

278
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,181
That will be your ultimate test.

279
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,184
Can you forgive him?

280
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,496
You better hurry, though.

281
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,863
In two hours the doors will lock

282
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,359
and this place
will become your tomb.

283
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:41,135
This is what
you've been waiting for, Jeff.

284
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,665
Let the game begin.

285
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,541
Help!

286
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,158
Let me out!

287
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,602
You fucking killed my son.

288
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,076
Don't you fucking beg.

289
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,017
Do you know who I am?

290
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:25,246
I'm your fucking teacher,
you motherfucker.

291
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,489
Drunk.

292
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:32,994
Hey?

293
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,424
He was my fucking son!

294
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,954
- Where is it?
- What?

295
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:04,757
Where is it?

296
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,696
How many times?

297
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,301
How many times
do I have to tell you

298
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:17,866
before you get it in your head?

299
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,776
I just wanted
to sleep with something.

300
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,840
No, no! You just nothing.

301
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,941
You don't...

302
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,385
touch things in Dylan's room.

303
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:33,349
Okay?

304
00:33:23,614 --> 00:33:25,606
I'm sorry, Daddy,

305
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,457
You know I love you,
don't you?

306
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:40,857
What do you think
Mommy would say

307
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:43,527
if she saw us like this?

308
00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:48,301
I'm gonna go
get ready for school.

309
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:13,931
Daddy!

310
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:32,886
Hello?

311
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,654
Hello?

312
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:58,636
Hey!

313
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:17,326
All right, John, I need you
to look at my nose.

314
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,831
Right here.

315
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:22,097
Look at my nose, please.

316
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,127
Follow my flashlight.

317
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,972
Tell me if you
feel any pain, all right?

318
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:36,481
That hurt?

319
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,657
It's begun.

320
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:46,955
He's out of the box.

321
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:55,362
So?

322
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,838
My 20 second analysis
without any medical equipment

323
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,364
is that his brain's herniating.

324
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,398
Oh.

325
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:04,106
He needs to go to the hospital

326
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:06,844
and have an operation
to decompress his brain.

327
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:09,981
Come here.

328
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,011
No really, come here.
Come here.

329
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,546
- No.
- Let me ask you something.

330
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:18,185
- Oh, God.
- Did I bring John to you,

331
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:21,164
or did I bring
your self-centered ass to him?

332
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,763
You are gonna start
fucking paying attention.

333
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:27,895
No one's going to any hospital.

334
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:33,168
I can't perform miracles.

335
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:36,611
You're giving him pain killers.
For a tumor like this he needs steroids.

336
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:38,512
- Prednisone.
- Oh, good, yeah.

337
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,779
Maybe we could try
some corticosteroids,

338
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,378
you know, like dexamethasone.

339
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:45,879
Why don't you fucking tell me something
that I don't know, you stupid cunt?

340
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:50,583
The only place
that he can get those drugs

341
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:52,859
is in a hospital.

342
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,564
Or else he's gonna die.

343
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:00,731
You are not a good listener.

344
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,797
I think you missed the part

345
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:06,403
that if he dies,

346
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:09,007
you die.

347
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,208
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

348
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,651
I'm not asking you.

349
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:15,278
He is.

350
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,553
He chose you.

351
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:21,085
Not me.

352
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:23,097
Amanda.

353
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:26,560
My doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

354
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,727
if you're threatening her.

355
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:32,636
Rules of our game
have been made very clear.

356
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:35,609
You need to abide by those rules.

357
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:36,976
Sorry.

358
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,927
Amanda.

359
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,957
Amanda, I need your help.

360
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,562
Amanda, he needs oxygen.

361
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:04,767
Oxygen, Amanda!

362
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,273
Put the mask on his face.

363
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,348
I need you to hold him down.

364
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:15,351
Keep his head to the side.

365
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,943
You got him?

366
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,534
What are you doing?

367
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,699
Ativan!

368
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,072
- Do you have Ativan?
- No!

369
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,470
Back off,
back off, back off, back off!

370
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,810
Stay with me, John.

371
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,844
You're almost through this.
Stay with me.

372
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:56,357
Stay with me.
Almost done with this.

373
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,015
Was that enough for you?

374
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,752
You ready to go
to the hospital now?

375
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:30,019
He needs to have an operation.

376
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:34,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

377
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,566
But we do it here.

378
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:38,266
- We do it here.
- What?

379
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,641
- What do you need?
- I need anesthetic

380
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:44,110
- for a procedure like this.
- Anesthetic. What else?

381
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:47,445
- Even with an anesthetic, he needs--
- Anesthetic, what else?

382
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:52,553
Power drill.

383
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:41,458
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

384
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:46,035
Please, please.

385
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:47,837
Let me go.

386
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,140
Please. Why...

387
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:53,173
are you doing this to me?

388
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:54,876
Don't--
don't kill me, okay?

389
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,012
- Please!
- Wait-- the key, the key.

390
00:42:58,054 --> 00:43:00,785
Here's the key, okay.
Come on!

391
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:02,688
Fuck!

392
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:04,956
Okay.

393
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:11,327
Please, I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms.

394
00:43:11,368 --> 00:43:12,733
Please help.

395
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,339
Welcome to your first test, Jeff.

396
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:23,402
For the past three years

397
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:27,042
you've cursed the name of all those
you thought were responsible

398
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,416
for the death of your son.

399
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:32,355
You fantasized
those accountable will pay.

400
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:35,550
Well, you will find
a woman in front of you

401
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:37,356
chained in place.

402
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:40,694
This will prevent her
from running.

403
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:42,995
Much like she did
on the day your son was hit.

404
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,370
Her name is Denica Scott.

405
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,931
She was the only witness present

406
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:53,241
at the scene
of your son's untimely demise.

407
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:04,281
If not for her own
self-absorption and cowardice,

408
00:44:04,323 --> 00:44:07,316
she could have brought
your son's killer

409
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:08,989
to justice.

410
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,791
Now it is you
who has a chance

411
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,823
to bring her to justice.

412
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:17,235
You alone can grant her
the gift of life

413
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:19,536
before she freezes
to death.

414
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,565
Behind the pipes
upon the back wall

415
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,601
you will find the key
that will free her

416
00:44:23,646 --> 00:44:26,739
and bring you one step closer
to the man responsible

417
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,749
for the loss of your child.

418
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:33,413
Will you claim the key
to save only yourself...

419
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,388
Help me!

420
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,121
...or can you find it within you
to save another?

421
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:41,592
Make your choice.

422
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:12,520
I didn't do anything.

423
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,158
I didn't do anything to you!

424
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,863
That's exactly it,
you didn't do anything.

425
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:24,266
I'm fucking dying.

426
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:27,242
He died!

427
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:29,008
In my arms.

428
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:30,981
My eight-year-old son

429
00:45:31,016 --> 00:45:33,485
died in my arms.

430
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:05,745
I made a mistake.

431
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:08,187
I'm so sorry.

432
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:11,419
I'm human. I'm human
just like your son was.

433
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:13,450
Okay?

434
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:18,496
Look at me.

435
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:20,525
I said look at me.

436
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:25,737
Oh my God.

437
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:29,666
It's so cold.

438
00:47:58,072 --> 00:48:00,061
Oh, God.

439
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,848
Amanda...

440
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,052
if you really care about John,

441
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:55,187
you won't let me do this to him.

442
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,889
You're a smart woman,
and you know what's right for him.

443
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,662
I'm sorry. I know it's hard
to concentrate when you're surrounded

444
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:03,861
by so many things
you could kill me with.

445
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,896
Like this axe
I saw you looking at.

446
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:10,774
Take it.
Please, it's yours.

447
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,075
Go on.

448
00:50:15,283 --> 00:50:18,149
I'd go for the neck,
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

449
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:21,087
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

450
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:22,646
Otherwise, he's likely
to get upset,

451
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,250
rip off his heart rate monitor--
boom!

452
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:28,320
Then you just have to find
the sensor and disarm it

453
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:30,889
so you can walk more than
30 feet out that door

454
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,923
without the collar detonating.

455
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:36,905
Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.

456
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,339
That could be tricky.

457
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:41,468
Slightest knock
in the wrong place could trigger it.

458
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:43,206
I should know.

459
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:47,945
I built it.

460
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:53,478
So?

461
00:50:53,522 --> 00:50:55,184
Do you have
everything you need?

462
00:50:56,826 --> 00:50:58,796
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

463
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,821
I don't have the tools
to save a life.

464
00:51:02,866 --> 00:51:05,768
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.

465
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,681
Hello, Amanda.

466
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,278
You don't know me, but...

467
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,856
I know you.

468
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:02,350
I wanna play a game.

469
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:06,061
There is only one key

470
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,228
to open the device.

471
00:52:11,472 --> 00:52:14,101
It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.

472
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,307
Look around, Amanda.
Know that I'm not lying.

473
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:25,449
Live or die?

474
00:52:25,487 --> 00:52:27,888
Make your choice.

475
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,560
Congratulations.

476
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:37,223
You are still alive.

477
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:42,499
Most people
are so ungrateful to be alive.

478
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,233
But not you.

479
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:46,265
Not anymore.

480
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:48,437
Amanda.

481
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:50,638
Do not be afraid.

482
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:53,148
Your life has just begun.

483
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:13,293
He made it through
the freezer room.

484
00:53:16,676 --> 00:53:18,665
He tried to save her.

485
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:31,451
There are...

486
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:35,120
some things...

487
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,221
I need you to do for me.

488
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:41,597
In my desk,
in the center drawer,

489
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:44,263
an envelope...

490
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:46,929
with your name on it.

491
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,168
She's gonna do a procedure on you...

492
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:54,874
Yeah.

493
00:53:54,915 --> 00:53:56,974
...to relieve the pressure
on your brain.

494
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:59,712
- Yeah.
- To help with the headaches.

495
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:11,057
- I can't do this.
- Amanda...

496
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,625
you can.
You can.

497
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,660
You're stronger now.

498
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,031
And I believe in you.

499
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,782
You chose her
'cause she's the best, right?

500
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,012
That's one reason I chose her.

501
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,370
Damn!

502
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,739
Hello?

503
00:56:27,777 --> 00:56:29,438
Help me, please!

504
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:35,807
Please, help me.

505
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:40,313
I'm in here.

506
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,958
Please get me out of here.

507
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,486
Help me, l--

508
00:56:52,303 --> 00:56:53,962
Hello?

509
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:57,164
I know you're there.
Please.

510
00:56:57,207 --> 00:56:58,732
Please, help me.

511
00:57:02,814 --> 00:57:06,408
I can hear you.
Please, answer me.

512
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,214
Help me!

513
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:12,686
Please!

514
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:14,213
Help me.

515
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,424
Get me out of here, please.

516
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:23,060
Please help me.
Get me out of here! Please!

517
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,128
Don't just stand there, help me.

518
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:34,369
Jeff, when the judge
presiding over your case

519
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:37,850
sentenced your boy's
murderer so lightly,

520
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:39,910
your soul never recovered.

521
00:57:39,954 --> 00:57:41,943
Now you have the power

522
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:44,456
to sentence his soul
straight to hell.

523
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:46,722
Or you can forgive.

524
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:48,283
The key that will free him

525
00:57:48,327 --> 00:57:50,922
is hidden inside
your son's possessions.

526
00:57:51,965 --> 00:57:53,901
Possessions you have clung to

527
00:57:53,935 --> 00:57:56,265
for far too long.

528
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:59,636
Now if you flip the switch
on the incinerator underneath you,

529
00:57:59,674 --> 00:58:02,403
a fire will cleanse you
of this obsession

530
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:04,138
and destroy them all,

531
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:06,510
Leaving only the key remaining.

532
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:09,208
It is also the key
that will bring you closer

533
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:12,516
to the man accountable
for taking your child.

534
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,614
He doesn't have much time, Jeff.

535
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,020
Let the game begin.

536
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,390
Please get me out of here, please.

537
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,929
What is that?

538
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:28,965
What's going on?

539
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:31,830
What's that sound?

540
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:13,281
I'm a criminal court judge,
for Christ sakes!

541
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:15,343
You can't do this to me.

542
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:18,444
You don't remember me?

543
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:25,329
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

544
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,802
He was the driver
who killed my son.

545
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,834
You gave him six months.

546
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:42,440
Okay, all right.
We can talk about your case.

547
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,610
Obviously, you want answers.

548
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:46,208
I can't give them to you like this!

549
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:49,879
Six months!

550
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:52,358
People get more
for fucking parking tickets.

551
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:57,057
Listen, now I can see that you're
in a great deal of pain,

552
00:59:57,098 --> 01:00:00,464
but there are ways that we
can have his sentence extended.

553
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,968
I can help you.

554
01:00:02,003 --> 01:00:03,300
Too late.

555
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:06,365
They let him go.

556
01:00:06,406 --> 01:00:08,204
Don't become what he is.

557
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:11,177
Don't become a killer.

558
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:12,977
Please.

559
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:14,777
I have a son too.

560
01:00:23,058 --> 01:00:24,787
Where are you going?

561
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:29,457
You've got to help me!

562
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:35,626
I'm so sorry.

563
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:42,001
Oh, God.

564
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:45,641
You're killing me.

565
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,215
Don't do this to me.

566
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:50,243
I'm gonna die.

567
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,387
Fuck you!

568
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,989
Fuck you, you fuck!

569
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:04,001
- You've gotta help me!
- Shut the fuck up.

570
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:27,749
Help!

571
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:46,403
Come on.

572
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:40,457
He made it through
the second test.

573
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,735
The judge is alive.

574
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:46,832
He's faster than I expected.

575
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,340
All right, John.

576
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:50,036
I need you to keep
your head to the side

577
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,136
and keep still.

578
01:03:52,179 --> 01:03:55,773
What's going on here is that your brain
is pushing against your skull.

579
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,445
I'm gonna try to relieve the pressure

580
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:00,478
by cutting away
a little bit of your skull.

581
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:03,149
It should help you
with your headaches

582
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,682
and drastically improve
your motor skills.

583
01:04:05,727 --> 01:04:06,955
Do you understand?

584
01:04:07,997 --> 01:04:10,327
All too well.

585
01:04:18,874 --> 01:04:21,207
Right, you're gonna feel
some slight discomfort.

586
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:25,247
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?

587
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:28,843
For a procedure like this
the patient needs to be fully alert.

588
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,450
Okay.

589
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:19,629
Amanda, I need you here.

590
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,740
Amanda!

591
01:05:24,778 --> 01:05:26,334
All right, John...

592
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:29,338
you're gonna feel some pressure.

593
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:42,692
Let's clip this.
Stop the bleeding.

594
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,977
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.

595
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,886
Hurry.

596
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:16,159
All right, John.
I need you to keep your mouth closed.

597
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:18,167
You're gonna hear a lot of noise.

598
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:18,052
John, how're you doing?

599
01:07:18,097 --> 01:07:20,031
Never better.

600
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:23,132
Okay.

601
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:36,875
All right. You're gonna
hear a lot of ringing.

602
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:39,316
I need you to stay very still.

603
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:42,289
Okay.

604
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,029
All right, John.

605
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,867
I'm gonna remove the skull.

606
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,689
He's stabilized.

607
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,702
John, I need you to raise your hand
and flex your fingers.

608
01:09:07,945 --> 01:09:09,608
John?

609
01:09:09,648 --> 01:09:11,513
John, raise your hand.

610
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:16,149
John, can you hear me?

611
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:20,020
What's happening?

612
01:09:21,526 --> 01:09:23,688
John!

613
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:25,560
What's happening to him?

614
01:09:25,598 --> 01:09:27,566
What's happening?

615
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:30,831
What's wrong?

616
01:09:37,244 --> 01:09:39,144
What's wrong?

617
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:42,237
Why isn't he moving?

618
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:45,116
Do something!

619
01:09:45,153 --> 01:09:47,622
Please!

620
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,024
Stay with me, John.

621
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:57,289
Good.

622
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:59,663
- I love you.
- I love you.

623
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,464
Breathe!
Breathe, damn it!

624
01:10:02,503 --> 01:10:04,165
Breathe, John.

625
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:07,335
- Love...
- Breathe.

626
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:17,081
I love you.

627
01:10:50,388 --> 01:10:52,379
You will give everything to me.

628
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:56,785
Every cell in your body.

629
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:01,293
Is that understood?

630
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,325
Yes.

631
01:11:05,836 --> 01:11:08,101
The marks on your arms--

632
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,302
they're from another life.

633
01:11:10,344 --> 01:11:12,936
We'll leave that life behind.

634
01:11:15,681 --> 01:11:17,673
When you go down
that corridor...

635
01:11:23,422 --> 01:11:26,822
there is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

636
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,197
Yes.

637
01:11:31,232 --> 01:11:33,221
Then start with this.

638
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,209
Go.

639
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:11,869
Who is that?

640
01:12:11,907 --> 01:12:14,238
Who's in there?

641
01:12:14,275 --> 01:12:16,403
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

642
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,273
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

643
01:13:32,926 --> 01:13:34,860
Put his left leg in the shackle.

644
01:15:00,518 --> 01:15:02,510
It's time to start our game.

645
01:15:31,218 --> 01:15:32,617
What's that?

646
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,219
Slow my heart rate.

647
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:37,451
Relax my muscles.

648
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:43,293
It's time.

649
01:15:47,236 --> 01:15:49,600
Close the door behind you.

650
01:17:29,943 --> 01:17:31,913
He can't hear you.

651
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,813
He doesn't even know
you're there.

652
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,659
Amanda.

653
01:17:46,726 --> 01:17:48,821
Put it away.

654
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,162
Trust me.

655
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,690
Put it away.

656
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,067
Leave us alone.

657
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:02,303
Now.

658
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,005
You fucking freak.

659
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,209
I apologize for her behavior.

660
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,754
She swims in my sea.

661
01:18:13,557 --> 01:18:15,683
In the end, she will be the closest

662
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:18,489
I've ever come to a connection,

663
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,520
to being understood.

664
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:27,201
But her emotion
is also her weakness.

665
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,106
John...

666
01:19:34,075 --> 01:19:36,340
Hello?

667
01:21:25,492 --> 01:21:27,358
Adam.

668
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:30,296
Adam!

669
01:21:38,006 --> 01:21:39,906
Come here.

670
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:41,965
I can help you.

671
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:44,342
I can help you.

672
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:50,914
Okay, now breathe.

673
01:23:17,979 --> 01:23:20,572
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff.

674
01:23:22,116 --> 01:23:24,051
But let me tell you something that l--

675
01:23:24,085 --> 01:23:26,176
that I know for sure.

676
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:28,654
No sentence I gave him,

677
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:31,784
not 500 years,
not even death, nothing,

678
01:23:31,826 --> 01:23:33,815
will take your pain away.

679
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:38,394
And vengeance
doesn't solve anything.

680
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:41,561
It only makes
the pain greater, Jeff.

681
01:24:03,492 --> 01:24:06,155
What the--
what the fuck?

682
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:08,628
Somebody help me!

683
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:11,962
What the fu--

684
01:24:14,637 --> 01:24:16,629
What the hell?

685
01:24:22,111 --> 01:24:24,979
What the f--
what the fuck are you doing?

686
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:28,683
Please help me.

687
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:32,287
Hello, Jeff.

688
01:24:32,323 --> 01:24:34,315
If you are listening to this,
that means

689
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,954
that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of

690
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:40,157
is finally unfolding.

691
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:41,994
Do something!

692
01:24:42,032 --> 01:24:44,525
In your head, he is a cipher.

693
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,970
A symbol of your life changing.

694
01:24:47,005 --> 01:24:48,564
A symbol of death.

695
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:52,771
I present him to you now
as a simple human being.

696
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,340
His name is Timothy Young.
He's 27 years old,

697
01:24:57,382 --> 01:25:00,011
a medical student
with a mother and a father

698
01:25:00,052 --> 01:25:01,817
just like you.

699
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:05,689
A man whose life also changed
the day your son died.

700
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:12,323
That day he made
a terrible mistake.

701
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:20,970
You believed he didn't pay
for that mistake,

702
01:25:21,008 --> 01:25:23,532
and now is your chance
to make him pay.

703
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:26,011
The device Timothy is strapped to

704
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:28,480
is my personal favorite.

705
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:30,041
I call it The Rack.

706
01:25:36,058 --> 01:25:39,026
The human body
is a miraculous creation.

707
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,827
Ever wonder how far
the arm can twist?

708
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:45,798
This device
is going to start twisting.

709
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:48,803
There is a chance
he might live, though, with your help.

710
01:25:48,837 --> 01:25:51,896
- Please!
- To your right, is a box.

711
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:54,671
At the back of the box is a key.

712
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:56,906
It's tied to the trigger
of a shotgun.

713
01:25:56,947 --> 01:26:00,006
The question
you have to ask yourself is this:

714
01:26:02,552 --> 01:26:04,783
- Are you willing...
- Have mercy!

715
01:26:04,822 --> 01:26:08,257
...to take a bullet
for the man who killed your son?

716
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:11,126
Does "do unto others
as you would have them do unto you,"

717
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:13,925
apply here, Jeff?
Make your choice.

718
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,040
My God.

719
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,392
We've got to help him, Jeff!

720
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,165
Fuck!

721
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:27,437
Please stop. No!

722
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:29,704
Please stop!

723
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:53,828
Jeff, just standing there
you're an accomplice to murder.

724
01:27:55,105 --> 01:27:56,627
Are you a murderer?

725
01:27:57,674 --> 01:28:00,404
- I've wanted to kill him every day.
- Oh my God!

726
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:03,070
For three years,
I've wanted to kill you.

727
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:06,512
Yeah, maybe I am.

728
01:28:06,549 --> 01:28:08,541
What about your family--

729
01:28:08,586 --> 01:28:10,552
your wife, your daughter?

730
01:28:14,358 --> 01:28:16,327
Fuck!

731
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:27,494
Oh God.

732
01:28:30,474 --> 01:28:31,941
Okay.

733
01:28:34,713 --> 01:28:36,705
Hold on, son.

734
01:28:58,903 --> 01:29:01,395
Hold on.
Don't give up!

735
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,672
Oh God.

736
01:29:03,711 --> 01:29:06,439
Oh God, oh God, oh God!

737
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:09,438
Son?

738
01:29:20,192 --> 01:29:21,957
Got the key.

739
01:29:36,878 --> 01:29:38,814
Help me!

740
01:29:38,848 --> 01:29:40,211
Help me!

741
01:29:48,524 --> 01:29:50,788
- Help me!
- Stop!

742
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,185
I forgive him!

743
01:29:56,633 --> 01:29:59,432
I forgive him!
Stop!

744
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:01,459
No!

745
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:08,101
God damn you!

746
01:30:41,948 --> 01:30:43,915
Don't you think it would be wise

747
01:30:43,949 --> 01:30:48,012
to engage me in conversation,
for your own sake?

748
01:30:48,055 --> 01:30:49,577
I asked you to tell me
about your husband.

749
01:30:54,528 --> 01:30:56,289
It's like we're strangers now.

750
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:58,729
And?

751
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:03,466
Last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.

752
01:31:03,502 --> 01:31:05,495
But now...

753
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,706
I'd give anything
in the whole world...

754
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,239
to see my husband.

755
01:31:18,284 --> 01:31:19,946
Matrimony's always fascinated me.

756
01:31:19,987 --> 01:31:22,480
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives.

757
01:31:22,525 --> 01:31:27,223
Wives on their backs
in hotel rooms with perfect strangers.

758
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:30,164
People who bear children,
only to neglect them.

759
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,962
Till death do us part, indeed.

760
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:36,335
I don't know
what you think you know,

761
01:31:36,372 --> 01:31:39,203
but my marriage
has survived more suffering

762
01:31:39,241 --> 01:31:41,675
than someone like you
could ever grasp.

763
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:44,271
Suffering?

764
01:31:44,314 --> 01:31:46,304
You haven't seen anything yet.

765
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:50,848
Someone like me?
Who am l?

766
01:31:50,887 --> 01:31:54,287
A monster.
A murderer.

767
01:31:54,323 --> 01:31:56,154
I don't condone murder

768
01:31:56,192 --> 01:31:59,628
and I despise murderers.

769
01:31:59,662 --> 01:32:01,255
Please.

770
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:10,362
Please, let me go.

771
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:19,171
We're fine, Amanda.
We don't need you.

772
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:25,820
I said we're fine.

773
01:32:28,059 --> 01:32:30,391
Amanda.

774
01:32:30,428 --> 01:32:32,591
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

775
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,563
He needs you.

776
01:35:07,026 --> 01:35:08,586
Why is this door open?

777
01:35:53,777 --> 01:35:55,333
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

778
01:35:55,377 --> 01:35:58,779
Kill me and you'll never get the key
to that fuckin' collar.

779
01:36:09,025 --> 01:36:10,789
Fuck! Fuck!

780
01:36:13,298 --> 01:36:14,729
Fuck!

781
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:27,101
If you make it through this, Lynn,

782
01:36:27,146 --> 01:36:29,544
you're going to thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

783
01:36:37,656 --> 01:36:40,147
Please.
Let me go.

784
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,792
I saved your life.

785
01:36:43,828 --> 01:36:47,026
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.

786
01:36:51,204 --> 01:36:53,434
Tell me about your daughter.

787
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:55,738
I understand
she's quite a little athlete.

788
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:04,615
Or we could talk about your son.

789
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,141
What did you say?

790
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,720
Why are you living with the dead
when you have such a beautiful family?

791
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:16,854
A husband who's endured alone.

792
01:37:18,598 --> 01:37:20,499
A daughter who needs a mother.

793
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:23,895
Patients who need
a competent physician

794
01:37:23,937 --> 01:37:26,032
who looks them in the eye

795
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:28,372
and treats them like human beings.

796
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:30,504
He's completed the third test.

797
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:34,145
Congratulations, Lynn.
You're free to go.

798
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:38,045
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

799
01:37:40,322 --> 01:37:42,722
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.

800
01:37:44,028 --> 01:37:47,463
No, he's not finished.
He's not all the way.

801
01:37:47,497 --> 01:37:51,161
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

802
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:55,260
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

803
01:37:55,305 --> 01:37:57,604
I said no.

804
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,306
Amanda, there are rules.

805
01:38:03,347 --> 01:38:04,576
I said no!

806
01:38:06,683 --> 01:38:08,777
She doesn't deserve to go free.

807
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:11,220
- You promised.
- I didn't promise you shit.

808
01:38:11,256 --> 01:38:14,052
Amanda, even with that gun,

809
01:38:14,091 --> 01:38:17,151
it is Lynn who holds your life

810
01:38:17,194 --> 01:38:19,187
in her hands.

811
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:22,462
Fuck you.
You gave her control over me?

812
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,969
- Fuck you!
- I won't tell anyone.

813
01:38:25,004 --> 01:38:26,130
- I promise I won't.
- Shut up.

814
01:38:26,172 --> 01:38:28,071
- Please, I have a family.
- Shut up.

815
01:38:28,106 --> 01:38:30,301
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

816
01:38:30,342 --> 01:38:32,470
And stop fucking moving around!

817
01:38:32,511 --> 01:38:35,912
And what about the other
test subjects that we left alive?

818
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:38,645
- Game over.
- I'll fucking kill you!

819
01:38:38,685 --> 01:38:42,017
- What absolute’s?
- Is that how you felt about them?

820
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:47,782
Is that how you felt
about Eric Matthews?

821
01:38:47,826 --> 01:38:50,261
- Eric Matthews?
- Mm-him.

822
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:53,857
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.

823
01:39:22,562 --> 01:39:24,929
Daniel!

824
01:39:29,003 --> 01:39:31,598
- Fuck!
- Daniel!

825
01:39:44,085 --> 01:39:45,816
Daniel!

826
01:40:14,285 --> 01:40:16,516
Fuck. Fuck!

827
01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:33,034
Fuck.

828
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,749
Where's my son?

829
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:30,629
Where is he, you junkie bitch?

830
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:31,827
Fuck you.

831
01:41:34,769 --> 01:41:36,260
Where is he?!

832
01:41:48,717 --> 01:41:50,242
Tell me where he is.

833
01:41:50,287 --> 01:41:51,982
Tell me where he is.

834
01:41:53,558 --> 01:41:55,547
Right fucking here.

835
01:42:14,446 --> 01:42:15,968
Bitch!

836
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,283
You're nothing, bitch.

837
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:26,581
You're nothing!

838
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:33,659
You're not Jigsaw.

839
01:42:38,104 --> 01:42:40,265
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

840
01:42:49,982 --> 01:42:51,883
You hear me?

841
01:42:52,886 --> 01:42:54,879
You're nothing.

842
01:42:57,357 --> 01:42:59,155
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

843
01:43:02,197 --> 01:43:04,129
You're nothing.

844
01:43:08,068 --> 01:43:11,901
I'll fucking kill you.
No!

845
01:43:13,341 --> 01:43:15,810
That's right.
I'm a murderer.

846
01:43:15,845 --> 01:43:18,573
He took my life from me.

847
01:43:18,612 --> 01:43:20,808
So I just returned
the fucking favor.

848
01:43:20,849 --> 01:43:22,841
No, Amanda,
that's what you thought.

849
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:26,314
But I know differently.

850
01:43:26,354 --> 01:43:28,584
You left him for dead, didn't you?

851
01:43:28,623 --> 01:43:30,752
Stop fucking with me.

852
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:33,956
But I cleaned up your mistakes.

853
01:43:33,996 --> 01:43:36,089
I forgave you for them.

854
01:43:38,533 --> 01:43:40,001
Let me go, please.

855
01:43:41,037 --> 01:43:43,199
What you do
is no different than murder.

856
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,071
You torture people,
you watch them die.

857
01:43:46,107 --> 01:43:49,101
But now you're begging me
not to kill this worthless bitch

858
01:43:49,146 --> 01:43:50,842
on the grounds of some game?

859
01:43:50,882 --> 01:43:54,044
You're walking us
towards a precipice, Amanda.

860
01:43:54,084 --> 01:43:56,416
- Step back.
- It's bullshit.

861
01:43:56,453 --> 01:43:58,149
Nobody changes.

862
01:43:58,189 --> 01:44:00,052
It's all a lie.

863
01:44:00,089 --> 01:44:02,058
If you fail in this, we all fail.

864
01:44:02,092 --> 01:44:04,494
Succeed, and we all succeed.

865
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,018
It's a lie.

866
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,558
I'll tell you.

867
01:44:12,603 --> 01:44:14,367
She hasn't changed.

868
01:44:14,405 --> 01:44:16,703
Because nobody fucking changes.

869
01:44:18,777 --> 01:44:21,371
Nobody is reborn.
It's all bullshit.

870
01:44:21,413 --> 01:44:23,506
It's all a fucking lie.

871
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:26,383
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.

872
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:41,526
I don't mean anything to you.

873
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:44,435
Oh, you mean everything to me.

874
01:44:44,471 --> 01:44:46,133
Fuck you!

875
01:44:46,173 --> 01:44:47,866
Our fates are linked.

876
01:44:49,275 --> 01:44:51,436
I've tried to help you, Amanda.

877
01:44:52,446 --> 01:44:54,139
So help me.

878
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:56,615
Fix me.

879
01:44:56,651 --> 01:44:58,312
Fix me, motherfucker.

880
01:45:00,022 --> 01:45:01,647
I'm standing right here.

881
01:45:06,995 --> 01:45:08,324
Why is she so important to you?

882
01:45:09,797 --> 01:45:11,890
She's not important to me.

883
01:45:13,703 --> 01:45:15,828
She's important to you.

884
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:17,668
She's not important to me.

885
01:45:17,706 --> 01:45:21,404
I beg you to reconsider that.

886
01:45:27,984 --> 01:45:30,382
- This is your last chance, Amanda.
- She's nothing.

887
01:45:47,236 --> 01:45:49,263
Your time's running out.

888
01:45:52,876 --> 01:45:54,605
Now you think about
what you are doing.

889
01:45:58,515 --> 01:46:01,177
Think about everything
that you've done.

890
01:46:08,961 --> 01:46:11,189
You think about
what you promised me.

891
01:46:11,228 --> 01:46:13,026
Think about our dreams.

892
01:46:14,032 --> 01:46:15,898
You think about tomorrow.

893
01:46:18,669 --> 01:46:20,160
Lynn?

894
01:46:20,205 --> 01:46:21,866
Jeff! Jeff!

895
01:46:23,643 --> 01:46:25,836
Lynn!

896
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,170
Lynn. Lynn!

897
01:46:29,215 --> 01:46:30,979
Jeff.

898
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:32,676
You just destroyed four lives.

899
01:46:33,919 --> 01:46:35,648
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

900
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:57,340
Baby.

901
01:46:57,379 --> 01:46:58,778
Amanda.

902
01:47:01,349 --> 01:47:03,374
It's okay.

903
01:47:08,623 --> 01:47:11,218
This was your test.

904
01:47:12,327 --> 01:47:14,156
Your game.

905
01:47:14,194 --> 01:47:16,494
What do I want?

906
01:47:16,532 --> 01:47:18,524
I wanna play a game.

907
01:47:20,802 --> 01:47:23,271
You are being tested.
Your will is being tested.

908
01:47:23,305 --> 01:47:25,365
Your will to keep someone alive.

909
01:47:25,408 --> 01:47:28,204
Can you do that?
Can you follow the rules

910
01:47:28,242 --> 01:47:30,234
and grant someone the gift of life?

911
01:47:32,383 --> 01:47:34,281
I was testing you.

912
01:47:34,316 --> 01:47:36,251
I took you in.

913
01:47:36,286 --> 01:47:37,617
You will give everything to me.

914
01:47:37,654 --> 01:47:39,452
Yes.

915
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:42,287
Every cell in your body.
I selected you

916
01:47:42,325 --> 01:47:45,727
for the honor
of carrying on my life's work.

917
01:47:45,763 --> 01:47:48,389
- But you didn't.
- That's right.

918
01:47:50,668 --> 01:47:53,035
- I'm a murderer.
- I despise murderers.

919
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:55,367
You didn't test anyone's will to live.

920
01:47:55,405 --> 01:47:57,237
Game over.

921
01:47:58,275 --> 01:48:00,744
Instead, you took away
their only chance.

922
01:48:00,779 --> 01:48:03,508
Your games were unwinnable.

923
01:48:03,547 --> 01:48:05,310
Your subjects merely victims.

924
01:48:05,349 --> 01:48:06,784
You!

925
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:11,118
There is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

926
01:48:11,156 --> 01:48:13,625
In my desperation, I decided

927
01:48:13,659 --> 01:48:16,057
to give you one last chance.

928
01:48:17,195 --> 01:48:19,595
So I put everything in place.

929
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:22,662
You chose her
'cause she's the best, right?

930
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,397
That's one reason I chose her.

931
01:48:24,437 --> 01:48:27,339
You didn't know
that Lynn and Jeff

932
01:48:27,374 --> 01:48:29,602
were husband and wife.

933
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:32,167
I had to keep that from you

934
01:48:32,211 --> 01:48:34,077
for the purposes of my game.

935
01:48:34,114 --> 01:48:36,910
I had to leave out the ruined marriage,

936
01:48:36,948 --> 01:48:39,645
the cheating wife,

937
01:48:39,685 --> 01:48:42,121
the vengeful husband,

938
01:48:42,156 --> 01:48:44,988
the neglected daughter.

939
01:48:45,025 --> 01:48:48,120
And I let you
make your own choices.

940
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:52,157
I wanted you to succeed.

941
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,933
Amanda.
Put it away.

942
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:58,632
Trust me,
even with that gun

943
01:48:58,673 --> 01:49:02,041
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.

944
01:49:02,077 --> 01:49:03,702
She's not important to me.

945
01:49:03,744 --> 01:49:06,339
I beg you to reconsider that.

946
01:49:06,381 --> 01:49:08,315
Unlock her collar and let her go.

947
01:49:08,349 --> 01:49:10,748
I said no!

948
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,980
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

949
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:15,821
You need to abide by those rules.

950
01:49:15,859 --> 01:49:18,417
You couldn't.

951
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,400
Oh, God.

952
01:49:42,252 --> 01:49:43,845
Game over.

953
01:49:56,067 --> 01:49:58,229
You haven't learned
anything tonight, have you?

954
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:01,568
Your rage and your vengeance
will only hurt the ones you love.

955
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:06,338
Killing me will only add
to your misery.

956
01:50:06,376 --> 01:50:08,573
It will not bring back your son.

957
01:50:08,613 --> 01:50:10,808
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

958
01:50:10,849 --> 01:50:13,112
She needs you now
more than ever.

959
01:50:14,786 --> 01:50:16,845
You can't kill me, Jeff.

960
01:50:26,932 --> 01:50:28,594
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

961
01:50:28,634 --> 01:50:32,127
Her time's running out.

962
01:50:40,247 --> 01:50:43,114
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

963
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:45,618
Your fate is in my hands.

964
01:50:45,652 --> 01:50:48,677
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

965
01:50:48,721 --> 01:50:52,351
- I love you.
- I love you.

966
01:50:56,463 --> 01:50:59,057
I'm taking you home, okay?

967
01:50:59,099 --> 01:51:00,762
Though you may not see any threat...

968
01:51:02,736 --> 01:51:05,137
there are threats all around you.

969
01:51:05,173 --> 01:51:08,143
Jeff, if you try
to move your wife, she will die.

970
01:51:08,177 --> 01:51:10,974
I can have an ambulance
here in four minutes.

971
01:51:11,012 --> 01:51:13,777
Would you like to take your wife
out of here tonight?

972
01:51:13,816 --> 01:51:15,907
Would you like to take her to safety?

973
01:51:15,949 --> 01:51:18,215
- Stay.
- Stand and face me, Jeff.

974
01:51:18,254 --> 01:51:21,554
- Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

975
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:24,957
Would you like to get your life back?

976
01:51:24,994 --> 01:51:27,987
Would you, Jeff?
I can make that happen.

977
01:51:30,065 --> 01:51:31,590
Which is it, Jeff?

978
01:51:31,634 --> 01:51:33,761
Come on.

979
01:51:33,803 --> 01:51:35,466
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

980
01:51:38,475 --> 01:51:40,033
What do you want?

981
01:51:40,077 --> 01:51:41,739
One final test.

982
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,677
The rules are simple.

983
01:51:43,712 --> 01:51:45,146
Over on that table

984
01:51:45,182 --> 01:51:47,980
is a host of vicious implements...

985
01:51:49,985 --> 01:51:52,922
which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

986
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:55,324
to take your vengeance,

987
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,690
to indulge your obsession.

988
01:51:57,727 --> 01:51:59,821
Or...

989
01:51:59,864 --> 01:52:02,993
you can choose
to put your vengeance aside

990
01:52:03,035 --> 01:52:05,126
and you can forgive.

991
01:52:06,704 --> 01:52:10,164
You can forgive me for the pain

992
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:12,176
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.

993
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:17,372
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

994
01:52:24,224 --> 01:52:26,215
Jeff.

995
01:52:27,227 --> 01:52:28,717
It's up to you.

996
01:52:29,763 --> 01:52:32,457
- I need you.
- Live or die, Jeff?

997
01:52:33,867 --> 01:52:36,427
Make our choice.

998
01:52:53,319 --> 01:52:55,550
I forgive you.

999
01:53:02,364 --> 01:53:04,230
Jeff. Jeff.

1000
01:53:04,267 --> 01:53:06,233
Jeff!

1001
01:53:06,267 --> 01:53:07,997
Yeah.

1002
01:53:15,243 --> 01:53:16,369
Jeff, no.

1003
01:53:31,294 --> 01:53:32,626
I forgive you.

1004
01:53:44,908 --> 01:53:47,070
Jeff!

1005
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:13,568
Jeff!

1006
01:54:28,122 --> 01:54:29,348
Lynn?

1007
01:54:31,825 --> 01:54:34,123
I gotta get us out of here now.
Okay?

1008
01:54:36,428 --> 01:54:38,659
But your beautiful hair--

1009
01:54:38,698 --> 01:54:40,689
your beautiful hair.

1010
01:54:46,173 --> 01:54:48,574
I'm gonna get us out of here.

1011
01:54:49,976 --> 01:54:51,672
Hello, Jeff.

1012
01:54:51,712 --> 01:54:54,010
I made this tape

1013
01:54:54,048 --> 01:54:56,313
as an insurance policy,
if you will.

1014
01:54:59,387 --> 01:55:00,979
And if you're listening to it,

1015
01:55:01,022 --> 01:55:03,686
then it's time to collect.

1016
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,619
I was your final test, Jeff.

1017
01:55:07,663 --> 01:55:11,530
Your final test of forgiveness,

1018
01:55:11,565 --> 01:55:13,158
and if you are listening to this,

1019
01:55:13,201 --> 01:55:15,396
then you failed.

1020
01:55:16,773 --> 01:55:18,568
Now you must pay the price.

1021
01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:22,971
The price of holding on
to all that anger.

1022
01:55:23,013 --> 01:55:26,139
The price of driving your own wife
away from you.

1023
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:28,810
The price for living
for nothing but vengeance.

1024
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:32,946
Now I will give you
something to live for.

1025
01:55:32,988 --> 01:55:35,287
I told you
that you couldn't kill me, Jeff.

1026
01:55:35,325 --> 01:55:38,385
But I didn't tell you why.

1027
01:55:38,428 --> 01:55:40,226
And the answer is simple.

1028
01:55:41,231 --> 01:55:44,759
I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.

1029
01:55:45,802 --> 01:55:48,397
I am the only person who knows

1030
01:55:48,439 --> 01:55:51,841
where your daughter is.

1031
01:55:52,842 --> 01:55:55,642
She only has
a limited supply of air.

1032
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,376
And if you want to get her back,
you'll have to play a game.

1033
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:01,578
No!

1034
01:56:02,587 --> 01:56:04,579
No!
