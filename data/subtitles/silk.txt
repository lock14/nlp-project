1
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,590
<i>Steaming water.</i>

2
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:29,301
<i>Strange trees.</i>

3
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:40,822
<i>Laughing children.</i>

4
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,539
<i>Her skin...</i>

5
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,186
<i>those eyes.</i>

6
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,086
<i>Why should I tell
you about it?</i>

7
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:43,563
<i>Why now?</i>

8
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,573
<i>Maybe I just need
to tell someone...</i>

9
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,941
<i>and maybe it's you.</i>

10
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:59,975
<i>I guess it all began
when I came back home</i>

11
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,243
<i>on leave from the army...</i>

12
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,123
<i>when I first saw Helene.</i>

13
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,735
When are you going?

14
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,832
I leave Thursday.

15
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,032
And when will
you be back?

16
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,441
One day, I'll have a
whole garden of these...

17
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,706
hundreds, thousands.

18
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:33,019
To make her happy,
I would have knelt down

19
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,432
and started planting
a garden that very day.

20
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,748
Oh.

21
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,558
But I had a military career to pursue.
My father insisted.

22
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,086
Things are heating
up in Austria.

23
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:49,156
I think it will come to
a head by summer.

24
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,977
The outcome is inevitable.

25
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,852
They won't know what to do when
they're faced with our military forces.

26
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:59,270
They will crumble like
a stale linzer torte.

27
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,578
What do you think, son?

28
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,574
More fish, dear?

29
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:06,983
The Austrians are fools, hm?

30
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,168
- I remember, when I was in the military...
- I couldn't stop thinking about her.

31
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:13,087
We used to say that if the Austrian's
ever decided to attack...

32
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,229
we'd finish our lunch...

33
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,504
<i>Then, someone came along
to solve my problem.</i>

34
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,728
Can I help you?

35
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,052
Please, sir!

36
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,459
- I'm sorry, your honor.
- You may leave us.

37
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,550
- What can I do for you, Baldabiou?
- You know what this is?

38
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,846
- Woman's stuff.
- Wrong.

39
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:40,038
It's money, a man's stuff.

40
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:42,826
Really?

41
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,268
- And why do I need to hear this?
- I'm going to repair the silk mill.

42
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,211
The mill? Where will you
find the money?

43
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,694
That's my problem.

44
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:54,882
Just make sure no one
gets in my way.

45
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:00,420
<i>Baldabiou repaired the
old silk mill in six months,</i>

46
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,822
<i>or so I was told,
as I was still in the army.</i>

47
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,226
Careful.

48
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:10,355
<i>By the time I returned
the following year...</i>

49
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,415
<i>there were
three more mills...</i>

50
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:17,694
<i>and more money than
our town had ever seen.</i>

51
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:20,086
- You know what that is?
- Money.

52
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,759
Wrong.
It's proof that I was right.

53
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,865
Congratulations.

54
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,139
- And what do you want me
to do now? - Nothing.

55
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:32,442
You'll be the mayor
of a very rich town.

56
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,170
Marry me...
Helene.

57
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:11,177
- Mr. Baldabiou.
- Hervé.

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,922
I hear you would
like to speak with me.

59
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,375
Yes, but not here.

60
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,579
- Do you play?
- Uh, no.

61
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:21,814
Why me?

62
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,269
I need a young man,
a clever man.

63
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:28,464
Yes, but I'm
not looking for work.

64
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,850
It's not work
I'm offering you.

65
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,643
I'm offering you a life.

66
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,423
A strange illness has
entered into the sheds.

67
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,622
Half the silkworms
are either sick or dead.

68
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:41,271
It's the same in Lyon, the same
everywhere, as far as Turkey.

69
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,612
- What is it? - Nobody knows,
but the clock is ticking.

70
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,509
We cannot solve the problem,
but we can get round it.

71
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,838
We have to. Otherwise,
this town will starve.

72
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:54,661
I need you to go and
get healthy eggs...

73
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,167
In Africa.

74
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,802
Africa?

75
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,220
I wish I could,

76
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,122
but my-my leave is up
in two days. Uh...

77
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,571
- I have to return to the barracks.
- Who says so?

78
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,151
- My father.
- Your father?

79
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,459
I'll take care of him.

80
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,322
<i>And he did.</i>

81
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,238
In nomine patris,

82
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,559
Et filii,

83
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,822
Et spiritus sancti.

84
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:35,336
- Amen.
- Amen.

85
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,026
<i>Two weeks later,
I gave up my uniform...</i>

86
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,185
<i>and I started a new life.</i>

87
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:56,004
<i>I thought love would
always be that easy.</i>

88
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:04,692
What are you writing?

89
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,935
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

90
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:23,089
I just spoke
with Baldabiou.

91
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,920
I leave a week
from tomorrow.

92
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,399
How long?

93
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,991
Weeks...

94
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:43,182
Maybe months.

95
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:51,471
Make it weeks.

96
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:58,640
<i>That was 1862,
the year of the Great Snow.</i>

97
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,364
<i>I set off to Egypt
to get the eggs.</i>

98
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:05,298
<i>It took me a month
to find them...</i>

99
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:09,368
<i>and a little less
to come back.</i>

100
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:15,557
<i>I knew nothing about silk,
or how it was made.</i>

101
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:17,799
<i>All I new was that,</i>

102
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:21,696
<i>I had to keep those tiny eggs
away from heat, keep them clean,</i>

103
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:25,255
<i>and bring them back before
they'd hatched. That's all I knew.</i>

104
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:31,600
<i>But back at the village,
someone else was about to hatch...</i>

105
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,673
<i>Ludovic Berbek.</i>

106
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,239
<i>Beatrice was so proud to
show off her baby that day.</i>

107
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,347
How was Africa?

108
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:26,375
- We never talked about it.
- It was beautiful.

109
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:30,120
Tired, but...
but very beautiful.

110
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,613
I have bad news.

111
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,584
I found dead worms.

112
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,466
Only a few, but still,
too many.

113
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,744
Seems the pébrine got
to Egypt before you did.

114
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,293
Pébrine?

115
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,924
They've given it a name.

116
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,909
I need you to
go to Japan.

117
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,327
Japan?

118
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,288
- Where is that?
- It's that way.

119
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,517
Just keep going to the end of
the world. Let me show you.

120
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,370
They make the most
perfect silk there.

121
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,754
I held some in
my hand once.

122
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,576
It was like holding nothing.

123
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,763
They've been making silk
for over a thousand years,

124
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,596
and they've never even
heard of a diseased egg.

125
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,412
It'll be a longer
journey this time.

126
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:27,418
Much longer.

127
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:34,349
Before I speak to the others,
I have to know that you're ready for this.

128
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,972
But there's a risk.

129
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,341
The journey's long
and dangerous.

130
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,562
And it's forbidden to travel
inland beyond Japan's harbors.

131
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:48,642
No Westerner has done it.
And yet, a place where no English

132
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,913
broker or Chinese trader can go is
a place where no disease can enter.

133
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,209
And why should we succeed
where others have failed?

134
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,683
There's no evidence
that we will succeed,

135
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,697
but I have it from
a trustworthy source

136
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,221
that the Japanese are trading
their silk on the black market.

137
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:04,183
We're interested in making silk,
not buying it.

138
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:07,235
I want to send Hervé to
trade for eggs, not silk.

139
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,986
But there's still no guarantee,
no matter how good the plan.

140
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,421
How much?

141
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:17,056
- At best, 10,000 francs.
- And at worst?

142
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:23,197
His life.

143
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,019
What is it?

144
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,789
I can't do this.

145
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,525
I cannot go.

146
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:40,486
- But you've already said you would go.
- I wasn't thinking...

147
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:43,499
about us.

148
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,543
I don't want you to give
this up because of me.

149
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,870
It's better than you going off
to fight some stupid war.

150
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,014
You'll be back by spring.

151
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,585
Don't forget.

152
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,510
My Japanese contact will
meet you in Vladivostok.

153
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,659
- Yes.
- And her letters for him.

154
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,633
He'll help you find
the village.

155
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,793
All you have to do
is bring back the eggs.

156
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,267
- That's all?
- Good luck.

157
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:41,172
- I'll always love you.
- I will always love you.

158
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,537
<i>And so, I headed off to
the end of the world.</i>

159
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:16,385
<i>I crossed the
border at Ségny.</i>

160
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,893
<i>Then I journeyed
through Europe.</i>

161
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,087
<i>I traveled by train
from Vienna...</i>

162
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:42,616
<i>Through Moravia...</i>

163
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,094
<i>And on to Kiev.</i>

164
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,971
<i>I hired a caravan to cross
the Russian steppes...</i>

165
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:01,043
<i>Three thousand miles
of ice and storm.</i>

166
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,679
<i>I had my Christmas dinner
at Lake Baikal,</i>

167
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:12,900
<i>and I thought of Helene...</i>

168
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,384
<i>always.</i>

169
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:20,187
<i>Then I followed the Amur River
along the Chinese border...</i>

170
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,551
<i>Until I reached the ocean.</i>

171
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,596
<i>I stopped eleven days
in Vladivostok,</i>

172
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,032
<i>where a Japanese guide
handed me my disguise.</i>

173
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,368
<i>I sailed across the sea
on a smuggler's ship.</i>

174
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,599
<i>And, finally...</i>

175
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,024
<i>I reached the
port of Sakata.</i>

176
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:06,225
<i>Strange...</i>

177
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>and haunting.</i>

178
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:16,982
<i>The Mogami River.</i>

179
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:22,676
<i>The snows of Yamagata.</i>

180
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:32,091
<i>I climbed the mountains
of Shinobu...</i>

181
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,825
<i>where new guides
were waiting for me.</i>

182
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:51,323
<i>And for the next three days,
we continued through the peaks.</i>

183
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:01,956
<i>Then, after countless freezing days,
and sleepless nights...</i>

184
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,523
<i>I reached my destination.</i>

185
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,442
Sakata, yes, yes.
I came...

186
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:46,537
Four.

187
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:31,553
Who are you?

188
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,990
- My name is Hervé Joncour.
- I know that.

189
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,230
I am a man of trade.

190
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,583
That is not who you are.
That is what you do.

191
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,189
I am the man you
see before you.

192
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:54,656
That is all.

193
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:21,611
I was born in a village
you've never heard of,

194
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,932
in a country
you've never seen.

195
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:31,220
I grew up like any child.
I was clothed and fed... educated.

196
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,064
I joined the army.

197
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,760
I left to marry
the woman I love.

198
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,474
And none of this
is who I am.

199
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:17,375
The eggs you were given...

200
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,625
are eggs of fish.

201
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:23,486
- They are worth nothing.
- I know that.

202
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:31,321
Is that why you paid for them,
with fake gold?

203
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:33,997
I paid for what I bought.

204
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:44,211
When you leave here,
you will have what you want.

205
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:49,144
When I reach the limits
of your lands... alive...

206
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:53,278
you'll get all the gold
that's owed to you.

207
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,281
I give you my word.

208
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,570
Whoa.

209
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:47,490
Shh.

210
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:01,404
You're back.

211
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,823
I'm back.

212
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,549
<i>On my return,</i>

213
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:24,050
<i>I was surprised to find
our life was still there,</i>

214
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,843
<i>just as I had left it...</i>

215
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:30,580
<i>but it was about
to change.</i>

216
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:35,202
Keep them closed.

217
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:37,450
- They are closed.
- We're almost there.

218
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:40,192
- Careful.
- I'm going to fall.

219
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:42,858
- Don't open them.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

220
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:46,964
Now.

221
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,121
Oh, my.

222
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,521
Well, what is it?

223
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,670
It's your garden.

224
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:56,384
It's my garden?

225
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,365
Well, not quite.
Not... yet.

226
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:01,625
For now, it's a plot of land,
our land.

227
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:05,486
And the house is also ours,
if you want it.

228
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,409
This is where we'll
grow old, Helene.

229
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,827
- But, I don't understand.
- The eggs have hatched. They're perfect.

230
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:16,522
This year's production
will be huge,

231
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:19,374
and Baldabiou has
already paid us our share.

232
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:24,335
We are rich, Helene.
I mean, we're very, very rich.

233
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,900
All this for such tiny eggs.

234
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:35,022
<i>And the eggs
became worms.</i>

235
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,970
<i>And the worms
grew stronger.</i>

236
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:47,226
<i>And we all grew richer.</i>

237
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:56,867
Nice try.

238
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:00,182
Isn't it difficult enough
with two hands?

239
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:05,371
The day the one-handed player wins,
is the day I leave town and never come back.

240
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,232
Like Ludovic's father.

241
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:13,117
I never understood
what happened to him.

242
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,617
- Did he just disappear?
- Well, first, he stopped talking.

243
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:23,055
Then one day, he woke up,
packed a suitcase, and left.

244
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,896
Beatrice was about
to have Ludovic.

245
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,519
That was quite a blow.

246
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:38,737
But why did he stop talking
in the first place?

247
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,493
That's one of the many things
he never talked about.

248
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:43,951
Hm.

249
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,680
- No, no, Papa.
- Mmm!

250
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,559
Do you think about it?

251
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,507
Sometimes.

252
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,801
What do you see?

253
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,613
Strange trees...

254
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:27,638
chickens pecking in the dirt,
laughing children.

255
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:31,240
What about this man?

256
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:33,449
You hardly mention him.

257
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,208
He was closed...

258
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,535
secretive.

259
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:50,210
It's hard to
remember all of it.

260
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:51,481
It's fading away.

261
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,779
<i>Papa!</i>

262
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:01,096
<i>Papa!</i>

263
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:04,711
I've ask Madame Berbek
to help with the chores.

264
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:07,041
The house is too
much for me.

265
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:10,311
That's a good idea.

266
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:14,729
Ludovic is growing.
They must need the money.

267
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,166
I knew you'd understand.

268
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,557
May I see?

269
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:24,791
No, it's not finished.

270
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,865
- I want to look at it.
- No.

271
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:43,707
<i>It was a happy time
that summer.</i>

272
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,406
<i>- Life was simple again.
- Opened his beak, and he felt sick.</i>

273
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:55,430
The cheese fell
out of his beak,

274
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:58,415
and the fox caught the cheese,
and ran off with it.

275
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,957
So this is the path,
and the fountain is there.

276
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,698
- Mm-hmm.
- And the lilies?

277
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:07,240
- You're standing on them.
- Oh. Sorry.

278
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,194
You're standing
on them again.

279
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:13,217
- So the lilies are everywhere.
- The lilies are everywhere.

280
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,582
<i>But I knew...</i>

281
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:31,693
<i>I knew that it couldn't
last forever.</i>

282
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:35,605
Ludovic?

283
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:38,580
I suppose we won't be eating
your aubergines this summer.

284
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,544
It's a flower garden,
not a potager.

285
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,653
Hello, Ludovic.

286
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,915
I've received some
news from Japan.

287
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:57,051
It may not be so easy to
get in and out the next time.

288
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,693
When was it easy?

289
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:02,130
I have Hara Jubei's
protection.

290
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:03,638
I will be fine.

291
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,894
What if you don't
make it to him?

292
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:09,952
Hervé...

293
00:34:12,242 --> 00:34:13,652
Listen...

294
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:17,101
you have a decision
to make.

295
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,117
You make it.

296
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,494
I'll always love you.

297
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:04,003
I'll always love you.

298
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,648
Au revoir!

299
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,594
Oh.

300
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:12,844
<i>And once again,
I made it to the village.</i>

301
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:17,679
Only this time, it was different.
This time...

302
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,646
I was not treated
as a stranger.

303
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:25,563
This time, I belonged.

304
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:40,726
Arigato.

305
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,215
<i>I had to find her.</i>

306
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,864
<i>So while I waited for the
eggs to be prepared...</i>

307
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:24,920
<i>I searched the village.</i>

308
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:48,170
I wanted you to
see this place.

309
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,818
Join me.

310
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,141
Perhaps another time.

311
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:01,882
You see these birds?

312
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:05,614
Only here can
you see them.

313
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:10,478
My father used to come here
every day to watch them...

314
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,085
and his father...

315
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,929
and the father
of his father.

316
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,679
And now...

317
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:36,192
you've seen them, too.

318
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:41,963
Come.

319
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,570
And what does it say?

320
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,356
Door was open.

321
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:25,858
Hervé Joncour.

322
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:29,655
Schuyler.
I am Dutch.

323
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,349
You are, uh, French,
I suppose.

324
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:36,639
What is your trade?

325
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:41,949
There is no point
in being secretive.

326
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:44,867
You're either here to buy,
or sell something.

327
00:43:45,146 --> 00:43:46,793
Which is it?

328
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:50,166
I'm here to buy silk eggs.
And you?

329
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,932
- Selling.
- What?

330
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,702
- Guns.
- Guns?

331
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,237
Mm-hmm.

332
00:43:58,273 --> 00:43:59,753
Mmm!

333
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:01,726
You must be paying
pretty well.

334
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,663
Hara Jubei has never offered me
anything like this before.

335
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:09,498
Do not be fooled
by his kindness.

336
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:14,753
There is a price
for everything.

337
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:41,291
And what about Mutzu?

338
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:43,081
He's still safe.

339
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,286
They've been
chased to the east.

340
00:44:45,288 --> 00:44:47,907
You never know.
Things are changing fast.

341
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:50,362
Even Hara Jubei's losing grip.

342
00:44:50,364 --> 00:44:52,028
I'd be on my guard,
if I were you.

343
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,628
- Is that a warning?
- Mmm... mmm...

344
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:58,253
His protectors in Edo
will fall soon.

345
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:03,606
You take my advice. Trade fast,
leave as soon as you can.

346
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:26,679
She's quite something,
isn't she?

347
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:31,208
- What do you know about her?
- Not much.

348
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,853
But I'll tell you this...

349
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,179
She's not what you think.

350
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:37,864
What do you mean?

351
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,360
She's not Japanese.

352
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:44,088
That is what they say.

353
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,126
Who knows?

354
00:46:14,175 --> 00:46:15,565
To you.

355
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,878
May we continue
to trade in peace.

356
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:25,474
To our lasting friendship.

357
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:45,114
Good night.

358
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:47,570
Good night.

359
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:40,467
<i>The next day, Hara Jubei took
her and left the village.</i>

360
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:47,226
<i>They gave me the eggs,
but I waited, two days,</i>

361
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:49,512
<i>hoping she might return.</i>

362
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:54,297
<i>She did not.</i>

363
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:15,278
<i>And, once again,
I left Japan.</i>

364
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:19,855
<i>This time, I had brought
back 10 boxes of eggs,</i>

365
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,695
<i>much more than
the previous trip.</i>

366
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:46,510
<i>I wanted to tell Helene.</i>

367
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:51,682
<i>I wanted to tell
her everything.</i>

368
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,134
Helene.

369
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,121
What?

370
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:12,603
I love you.

371
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:21,320
<i>And it tore me apart.</i>

372
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,152
What is it?

373
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:46,161
What is it?

374
00:54:20,653 --> 00:54:22,273
So she's not Japanese?

375
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:27,510
No.
She was Chinese.

376
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,601
She was the Emperor's
third wife.

377
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:36,695
Legend has it that...

378
00:54:36,972 --> 00:54:40,641
she was preparing tea
in the palace garden.

379
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:45,239
She accidentally dropped a
cocoon into the hot water...

380
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,485
And then she
discovered that,

381
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,128
a cocoon's fibers
could be unwound,

382
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:54,353
and a thread could
be obtained from it...

383
00:54:54,485 --> 00:54:57,251
one that was strong
enough for weaving.

384
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:00,505
Who told you that story?

385
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:04,706
A trader.

386
00:55:08,717 --> 00:55:10,326
What is it?

387
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:14,625
You've been sitting there
for over an hour. What is it?

388
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,811
I need your help
with something.

389
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:24,329
I need to find someone
who can speak Japanese.

390
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:26,144
Ask Hervé Joncour.

391
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:30,342
Don't make it difficult.

392
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,318
You know someone.

393
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:37,327
Who wrote the letter I
took on my first trip?

394
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:42,829
What is it you need
to translate?

395
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:47,737
Please.

396
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,112
Madame Blanche.

397
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:57,722
She runs a brothel in Lyon...
Number 12, Rue Moscat.

398
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,878
Men pay a lot of money
to be with her.

399
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,621
- And she speaks Japanese?
- She is Japanese.

400
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,376
Well, how did she
wind up in Lyon?

401
00:56:04,876 --> 00:56:07,112
She married a French
merchant in Yokohama,

402
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:10,713
he died on their return to France,
she had to fend for herself.

403
00:56:27,293 --> 00:56:30,240
I have to go to
Lyon tomorrow.

404
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,800
I'll be back before nightfall.

405
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,405
What's wrong?

406
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,405
Helene?

407
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,882
We have to be patient.

408
00:57:07,009 --> 00:57:10,121
We've been trying to have
a child for two years.

409
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:15,505
We have to try harder.

410
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:23,074
Come to bed.

411
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:24,547
Come.

412
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,800
I won't be long.

413
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,860
Voilŕ.

414
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:20,128
Madame Blanche
will see you now.

415
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:27,257
Please...

416
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:28,628
sit.

417
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:45,608
And what makes you think you're
rich enough to sleep with me?

418
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:50,181
That is not what
I came for.

419
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,585
- What do you want then?
- I need your help.

420
00:58:55,106 --> 00:58:56,943
Never mind the price.

421
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:02,295
I need to know
what is written on it.

422
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,371
Will you help me?

423
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,141
Where did you get this?

424
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,485
"Come back or I shall die. "

425
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:34,190
- Come back?
- That's what it says.

426
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:37,585
"Come back or I shall die. "

427
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:47,963
Thank you.

428
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:00,503
Forget about it.

429
01:00:02,322 --> 01:00:05,177
Not the money, the woman.

430
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:08,483
Forget about her.

431
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:13,452
She won't die,
and you know it.

432
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:26,423
I went to see that fellow,
Pasteur.

433
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,297
Yes?

434
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:30,753
He's pretty darn clever.

435
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:33,657
He's discovered
how to isolate,

436
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:36,550
the infected eggs from
the healthy ones.

437
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:38,222
He can't cure them,

438
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:40,072
but he can tell which
ones are good.

439
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:42,208
And the results
are guaranteed.

440
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,731
Mmm.
Really?

441
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,679
There's trouble
again in Japan.

442
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,994
This time, it's serious.

443
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:55,494
The French Consulate in Yokohama
have been sending dispatches.

444
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,865
They say it's chaos.

445
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:03,778
And this, uh,
Italian fellow, Ferreri,

446
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:08,224
he's come back from China
with eggs, tons of them.

447
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,378
Healthy from first to last,
same with Bolée.

448
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,634
They're offering
us a good deal.

449
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:18,715
Seven francs for the gram.

450
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,000
And they'll insure them.

451
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,536
And with the work that Pasteur is doing,
we might get by on our own.

452
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:28,664
It would be madness
to go back there.

453
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,858
It's too risky.

454
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,489
I don't want to
lose you, Hervé.

455
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,780
I'm going to Japan,
Baldabiou.

456
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:45,447
Even if it means I have
to pay for the trip myself.

457
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:49,599
All you have to decide
is whether I'm...

458
01:01:49,844 --> 01:01:53,614
selling the eggs to you or...
someone else.

459
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:58,496
We've heard that the eggs coming
in from Turkey are perfectly healthy.

460
01:01:58,706 --> 01:02:01,269
- That's where the Lyon breeders go.
- The Italians, too.

461
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:03,768
- Well, then why don't we do the same?
- Japan is too dangerous.

462
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:05,726
- We can no longer afford the risks.
- Gentlemen...

463
01:02:06,204 --> 01:02:09,326
Gentlemen, please.
These eggs are unreliable.

464
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,489
The Japanese
eggs are pristine.

465
01:02:12,034 --> 01:02:14,199
Who really knows
what's going on there?

466
01:02:14,226 --> 01:02:16,110
Very few people have seen
it with their own eyes,

467
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:19,606
- and one of them lives right here.
- This is my son you are talking about.

468
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:21,257
He's made the voyage twice.

469
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,742
If anybody understands the dangers,
he does, and he believes it can be done.

470
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,530
Now, I, for one, am staking my
money on another trip.

471
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,327
You gentlemen,
must make your own decision.

472
01:02:42,327 --> 01:02:45,295
- Isn't there some way you can
stop him? - I'm afraid not.

473
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:51,387
There is something else.

474
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:58,442
There seems to be some
trouble over there...

475
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:00,923
an uprising.

476
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:05,001
It could be dangerous.

477
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:11,992
Then I suppose all I can do is
give him a reason to come back.

478
01:03:30,603 --> 01:03:32,599
You're not to...

479
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:35,670
worry about anything.

480
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,632
I know.

481
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,193
I won't.

482
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,630
I have protection there.
I will...

483
01:03:47,664 --> 01:03:49,425
I will be fine.

484
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:32,876
<i>This time, it really was
the end of the world.</i>

485
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:36,833
<i>The rebellion had
reached the village.</i>

486
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,313
Are you alone?

487
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,782
Are you hurt?

488
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:26,266
Where are they?

489
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,306
Hai.

490
01:06:43,286 --> 01:06:44,605
Hai.

491
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,443
Hara Jubei.

492
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,710
Take me there,
do you understand?

493
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,337
Wait.

494
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:46,787
Arigato.

495
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,552
How did you find us?

496
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:44,545
Who brought you here?

497
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:47,735
Answer me!

498
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,960
There is nothing
for you here.

499
01:09:50,988 --> 01:09:55,302
- Only war, and it's not your war.
- War is an expensive game.

500
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:58,363
You have need of me.

501
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,609
- I have need of you.
- You should not have come here.

502
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,637
Keep your gold and go!

503
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:07,262
- Hyah!
- Hara Jubei!

504
01:11:48,393 --> 01:11:51,345
Japan is an
ancient country.

505
01:11:53,762 --> 01:11:56,395
It has ancient laws.

506
01:11:56,685 --> 01:11:59,747
There are crimes here
for which it is acceptable,

507
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:02,269
to condemn a man to death.

508
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:05,842
This is a rifle, my friend.

509
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:09,565
Keep your head down.

510
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:15,831
The boy committed
one of those crimes,

511
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:20,163
when he carried a love message,
from his mistress.

512
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:23,702
He was carrying
no message.

513
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:27,090
He was the message.

514
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,064
He was a boy.

515
01:12:32,659 --> 01:12:35,331
Keep your eyes down.

516
01:12:45,373 --> 01:12:49,893
Now go, and never
return here again.

517
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:22,655
<i>It took me 11 days
to reach Sakata,</i>

518
01:13:22,744 --> 01:13:25,618
<i>where I finally found
four boxes of eggs.</i>

519
01:13:26,662 --> 01:13:29,288
<i>I packed the boxes
in crates filled with ice,</i>

520
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,617
<i>fearful that they
would hatch early.</i>

521
01:13:32,728 --> 01:13:36,078
<i>I reached the Russian coast
by the end of March,</i>

522
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,546
<i>which was one month
later than usual.</i>

523
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:45,537
<i>Summer had already
come to Europe.</i>

524
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:58,291
<i>And then, one morning,
I knew it was over.</i>

525
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:04,326
<i>The eggs had hatched.</i>

526
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:07,682
<i>The worms were dead.</i>

527
01:14:09,148 --> 01:14:13,154
<i>Millions of them...
all dead.</i>

528
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:43,569
Ludovic!

529
01:15:01,274 --> 01:15:02,543
Hyah!

530
01:15:13,534 --> 01:15:15,594
I thought you were dead.

531
01:15:24,032 --> 01:15:27,488
And in the whole world,
there was nothing beautiful left.

532
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:51,239
<i>That was a terrible summer.</i>

533
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:58,463
<i>We had to close
three of the four mills.</i>

534
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:03,704
<i>Baldabiou had to make up
stories to explain my failure.</i>

535
01:16:05,154 --> 01:16:08,864
<i>And with the thought
of all that had happened...</i>

536
01:16:08,934 --> 01:16:12,914
<i>how I'd failed the village,
how I'd failed Helene...</i>

537
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,356
<i>I sank into silence.</i>

538
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:33,328
So, here you are.

539
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:42,864
What's wrong with you?

540
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:45,966
You haven't come
around for ages.

541
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,461
Listen, Hervé...

542
01:16:50,775 --> 01:16:53,096
Sooner or later, you're gonna
have to talk to someone.

543
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:55,405
It might as well be me.

544
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,283
It might as well be now.

545
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,345
What happened?

546
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:05,833
What happened in Japan?

547
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:10,885
There's nothing more to say.
I told you everything.

548
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:12,505
That's rubbish.

549
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:15,573
There's nothing more to say.

550
01:17:31,631 --> 01:17:34,734
If things continue like this,
we'll all starve.

551
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,448
Something has to be done.
Do you have any ideas?

552
01:17:50,153 --> 01:17:51,609
Baldabiou.

553
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,448
We'll build a garden.

554
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:03,046
I'll hire everyone
in the village...

555
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:06,243
anyone who's strong enough to
dig men, women, children, too.

556
01:18:07,728 --> 01:18:10,730
And, together,
we'll build Helene's garden.

557
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:16,448
We started to work
in late summer.

558
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:17,939
Whoa!

559
01:18:21,841 --> 01:18:24,573
- May I have some water?
- I don't think you're working.

560
01:18:31,819 --> 01:18:34,148
<i>And we finished most
of it by the fall.</i>

561
01:18:37,341 --> 01:18:39,444
You pull that one up?

562
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:42,100
Weeds are bad for trees.
They take their food,

563
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:44,670
so you've got
to pull them out.

564
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:48,722
Then why do we have them
if they are bad?

565
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,914
God made them
to keep us busy.

566
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,087
- In nomine patris, et filii...
- So winter came, and...

567
01:19:05,122 --> 01:19:07,706
- ... et spiritus sancti.
- ... everyone had enough to eat.

568
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,479
<i>Then a letter arrived.</i>

569
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,381
<i>It took me five days
to open it.</i>

570
01:19:18,533 --> 01:19:20,886
<i>It was stamped
in Oostende,</i>

571
01:19:21,113 --> 01:19:23,984
<i>but it had a Japanese
seal in the corner.</i>

572
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,636
I'm going to bed.

573
01:19:37,877 --> 01:19:39,965
I'll be up in a minute.

574
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:05,417
I shall read it for you,

575
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,762
but this time,
I want no money.

576
01:20:09,436 --> 01:20:13,731
What I want is a promise,
that you will never come back here.

577
01:20:17,028 --> 01:20:18,820
I promise.

578
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,274
"My dear master...

579
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:31,014
"do not be afraid.

580
01:20:31,122 --> 01:20:34,125
"Do not move.
Do not speak.

581
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,828
"No one will see us.

582
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:41,231
"Stay as you are.

583
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,168
"I want to look at you.

584
01:20:44,824 --> 01:20:47,298
"We have the night
to ourselves,

585
01:20:47,323 --> 01:20:50,024
"and I want to look at you.

586
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:53,851
"Your body over me...

587
01:20:54,002 --> 01:20:56,252
"your skin, your lips.

588
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,375
"Close your eyes.

589
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:01,060
"No one can see us.

590
01:21:02,394 --> 01:21:05,153
"And I am here
at your side.

591
01:21:05,518 --> 01:21:07,789
"Do you feel me?

592
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:12,069
"When I touch you
for the first time,

593
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:15,336
"it will be with my lips.

594
01:21:16,257 --> 01:21:18,662
"You will feel the warmth,

595
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:21,414
"but you will
not know where.

596
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:25,328
"Perhaps,
it will be on your eyes.

597
01:21:26,063 --> 01:21:29,215
"I will press my mouth
to your eyes,

598
01:21:29,537 --> 01:21:32,618
"and you will feel
the warmth.

599
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:37,014
"Open your eyes now,
my beloved.

600
01:21:37,465 --> 01:21:39,033
"Look at me.

601
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:44,060
"Your eyes on my breast,
your arms lifting me,

602
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:47,363
"letting me slide
on to you.

603
01:21:49,024 --> 01:21:53,382
"My faint cry,
your body quivering.

604
01:21:53,954 --> 01:21:57,942
"There is no end to it,
don't you see?

605
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:02,335
"You will forever be
throwing your head back.

606
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:06,030
"I will forever be
shaking off my tears.

607
01:22:08,046 --> 01:22:10,801
"This moment had to be.

608
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:13,881
"This moment is...

609
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:20,118
"and this moment will continue,
from now until forever.

610
01:22:22,989 --> 01:22:26,119
"We shall not see
one another again.

611
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,935
"What we were meant to do,
we have done.

612
01:22:29,002 --> 01:22:32,828
"Believe me, my love,
we have done it forever.

613
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,305
"Preserve your life
out of my reach,

614
01:22:36,606 --> 01:22:38,716
"and if it serves
your happiness,

615
01:22:38,822 --> 01:22:42,838
"do not hesitate for a moment to
forget this woman, who now says,

616
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:45,645
"without a trace of regret...

617
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:49,353
"farewell. "

618
01:23:33,828 --> 01:23:36,296
<i>That year, in Edo,</i>

619
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:40,538
<i>they signed a treaty,
authorizing the export of silkworm eggs.</i>

620
01:23:46,056 --> 01:23:49,240
<i>A few years later,
they opened the Suez Canal.</i>

621
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:54,463
<i>After that, a journey to Japan
would take twenty days...</i>

622
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,666
<i>even less to come back.</i>

623
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:00,350
<i>A new era had begun.</i>

624
01:24:03,283 --> 01:24:05,828
<i>So the years passed.</i>

625
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:10,813
<i>We traveled.</i>

626
01:24:15,912 --> 01:24:19,279
<i>We accepted the fact that
we would not have a child.</i>

627
01:24:19,364 --> 01:24:23,787
Nine plus seven
equals sixteen.

628
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:29,149
- Now, sometimes it may seem like numbers
keep their secrets. - And a sort of peace,

629
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:33,266
- entered our lives. - But you have to
be patient. You have to keep trying.

630
01:24:33,672 --> 01:24:35,462
Do you understand?

631
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:41,697
<i>But it didn't last long.</i>

632
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:44,304
<i>Not long enough.</i>

633
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:56,328
Yes, but are you certain?

634
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:02,055
- No change. She needs to rest.
- But you've been saying that for weeks.

635
01:25:02,268 --> 01:25:05,554
All she's been doing is resting.
She's just getting weaker.

636
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:08,942
- Be patient.
- I am being patient!

637
01:25:48,134 --> 01:25:50,400
- Good day, Ludovic.
- Good day, Madame.

638
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:52,905
Do you have a moment?

639
01:25:55,462 --> 01:25:58,961
- I have a favor to ask you.
- Whatever I can do.

640
01:26:01,444 --> 01:26:04,682
I would like you to help
Hervé with the garden.

641
01:26:04,953 --> 01:26:06,956
Of course.

642
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:11,802
I mean, in the future.

643
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:17,280
He's going to
need your help.

644
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,367
You can depend on me.

645
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:26,347
Good.

646
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:01,610
Beatrice stopped by.

647
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,519
- She brought us dinner.
- Hm. You'll have to thank her for me.

648
01:27:13,832 --> 01:27:16,961
And Baldabiou sent
over a dozen quail.

649
01:27:18,502 --> 01:27:21,853
God knows...
where he got them.

650
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,496
Probably sent someone
on a journey.

651
01:28:05,206 --> 01:28:08,390
There's things that
I haven't told you, Helene.

652
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:10,703
I know.

653
01:28:11,859 --> 01:28:14,922
I just... I couldn't
find the words.

654
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,475
It's all right.

655
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:21,938
It's all right.

656
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:33,407
Do you remember the first day
you showed me the land?

657
01:28:35,175 --> 01:28:38,126
You said there'd be
a garden there.

658
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:44,783
You said,
"This is where we'll grow old. "

659
01:28:49,456 --> 01:28:51,863
Are we old, Hervé?

660
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:15,564
<i>She died in late April...</i>

661
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:22,097
<i>A few days before
her lilies bloomed.</i>

662
01:29:32,342 --> 01:29:36,368
<i>And then, something
extraordinary happened.</i>

663
01:29:40,368 --> 01:29:41,394
Aah!

664
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:54,720
- The one-handed Baldabiou...
- Hmm.

665
01:29:54,855 --> 01:29:57,698
- Pulled off an impossible shot.
- Fancy that.

666
01:29:57,853 --> 01:30:02,252
<i>So, he gave his mill to Verdal,
packed one suitcase,</i>

667
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:05,740
<i>and he left... for good.</i>

668
01:30:16,027 --> 01:30:19,257
I knew a man once who
built his own railroad.

669
01:30:20,865 --> 01:30:23,796
And the beautiful thing is,
he built it completely straight,

670
01:30:24,096 --> 01:30:26,529
without a single curve.

671
01:30:27,233 --> 01:30:29,555
He had a reason for that.

672
01:30:30,652 --> 01:30:33,842
I can't recall what it was.

673
01:30:36,573 --> 01:30:39,315
The reasons get forgotten.

674
01:30:49,804 --> 01:30:53,773
<i>Not long after that, I found something
that sent me on another journey...</i>

675
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:59,369
<i>Though, not quite
as far this time.</i>

676
01:31:03,594 --> 01:31:06,539
She's gone, sir.
Gone to Paris.

677
01:31:06,697 --> 01:31:09,372
Yes, but do you have
an address for her?

678
01:31:09,617 --> 01:31:12,567
I'm sorry.
I cannot help you.

679
01:31:16,372 --> 01:31:18,384
Thank you very much.

680
01:31:35,353 --> 01:31:37,539
How did you find me?

681
01:31:51,832 --> 01:31:54,604
I've knocked on
every door in Paris.

682
01:32:07,057 --> 01:32:10,068
It was you who wrote
that letter, wasn't it?

683
01:32:17,012 --> 01:32:18,817
Wasn't it?

684
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:25,744
It was not I who wrote it.

685
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:31,715
It was Helene.

686
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:41,707
She had already written it
when she came to see me.

687
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:48,409
She asked me to copy it out
in Japanese, and I did.

688
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,738
She read me that letter.

689
01:33:01,095 --> 01:33:04,649
She read those words
with a voice that,

690
01:33:04,685 --> 01:33:08,034
I have never been
able to forget.

691
01:33:17,523 --> 01:33:20,627
I know it's hard
to understand...

692
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:25,203
But I heard her read
that letter...

693
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:29,738
and more than anything...

694
01:33:30,978 --> 01:33:34,122
she wanted to
be that woman.

695
01:33:36,389 --> 01:33:38,844
She was that woman.

696
01:33:49,853 --> 01:33:51,407
Farewell.

697
01:34:08,997 --> 01:34:11,284
- Ludovic.
- Good day, sir.

698
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,796
What are you doing here on a Sunday?
You shouldn't work on a Sunday.

699
01:34:17,006 --> 01:34:20,404
I have a few things to finish,
some trimming and weeding.

700
01:34:21,207 --> 01:34:23,449
How was your
trip to Paris?

701
01:34:24,247 --> 01:34:27,126
Fine.
Thank you.

702
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:35,967
Would you like
to sit with me?

703
01:34:36,034 --> 01:34:37,804
Of course.

704
01:34:56,206 --> 01:34:59,413
I think you like this place
as much as I do.

705
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:01,417
Very much, sir.

706
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:08,300
In a way, I suppose
it's your garden, too.

707
01:35:10,734 --> 01:35:13,744
Remember that little tree
I planted with Madame?

708
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:16,261
It's grown so tall now.

709
01:35:20,278 --> 01:35:22,436
I'm sorry, sir.

710
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:26,164
Don't be sorry.

711
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,440
Silly.

712
01:35:33,002 --> 01:35:36,148
Death is a strange thing,
Ludovic.

713
01:35:38,944 --> 01:35:41,045
Strange.

714
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,546
<i>But why should I
tell you about this?</i>

715
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:02,525
<i>Why now?</i>

716
01:36:03,502 --> 01:36:06,693
<i>Maybe I just need
to tell someone...</i>

717
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:09,362
<i>and maybe it's you.</i>

718
01:36:10,213 --> 01:36:14,872
<i>I guess it all began when I came
back home on leave from the army...</i>

719
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:18,176
<i>when I first saw Helene.</i>

720
01:36:35,563 --> 01:36:38,811
And now you know
the real story.

721
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:44,006
It's late now.

722
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:46,753
Finish your
work tomorrow.

723
01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:08,664
<i>My beloved...</i>

724
01:37:09,372 --> 01:37:11,515
<i>do not be afraid.</i>

725
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:15,037
<i>Do not speak.</i>

726
01:37:17,309 --> 01:37:20,750
<i>Stay as you are.
I'm here at your side.</i>

727
01:37:21,903 --> 01:37:23,836
<i>Do you feel me?</i>

728
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:26,779
<i>When I touch you
for the first time,</i>

729
01:37:27,162 --> 01:37:31,530
<i>you will feel the warmth,
but you will not know where.</i>

730
01:37:31,872 --> 01:37:34,922
<i>Perhaps,
it will be on your eyes.</i>

731
01:37:36,449 --> 01:37:39,581
<i>Who could ever erase
this moment?</i>

732
01:37:40,712 --> 01:37:44,368
<i>There is no end to it,
don't you see?</i>

733
01:37:47,353 --> 01:37:50,025
<i>What we were meant to do,
we have done.</i>

734
01:37:50,295 --> 01:37:53,792
<i>Believe me, my love,
we have done it forever.</i>

735
01:37:54,489 --> 01:37:57,149
<i>And if it serves
your happiness,</i>

736
01:37:57,425 --> 01:38:02,212
<i>do not hesitate for a moment to
forget this woman, who now says,</i>

737
01:38:03,057 --> 01:38:06,274
<i>without a trace of regret...</i>

738
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:10,926
<i>Farewell.</i>

739
