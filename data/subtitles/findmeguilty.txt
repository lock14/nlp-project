...full sum and total of the F.B.I.
and the police department's efforts here.



As has been outlined before,
a couple ofhundred...



M-Mafia and organized crime members
and associates have been indicted...



in the last year to two years.



So that the attack is at the top level,
the middle level and the lower level.



And we are doing everything that
we can to identify, indict and convict...



the capos, the soldiers and
the associates of the Mafia as well.



Look, I gotta clip a guy.
All I'm carrying is a .22.



Of course I know
it's not worth a shit.



What the fuck do you think
I'm calling you for?



Go fuck yourself!.



- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.



Your, uh, your papa here?



Uh, yeah. He's upstairs, but he's sleepin'.
I'm makin' a banana daiquiri. You want one?



Asshole.



My God! Cousin, what are you...



What are you doin', Coz. I love you.



Coz, why are you doing this?



Pop!



Pop?



Papa! Pop!



Pop!



You're not being
very helpful, Jackie.



I'm gonna have to let
your parole officer know.



Come on, Jackie.
We're not morons.



You had your eyes shut the whole time?
You fuckin' expect us to believe that?



I'm sorry, miss.



My eyes were shut the whole time.



I never saw nothin'.



- Miss?
- My eyes were shut the whole time.



Yeah. All right, Manny.
Let's get out of here.



Hey. Someone sneaks in and pops you,
don't come complainin'to us.



If somebody pops me,
I won't go complainin' to nobody.



Hey, Pop.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?



- I mean, I feel like killing this motherfucker myself.
- Hey, watch your language.



- And you don't rat out the people that love you.
- Love you?



He's your cousin. He puts four fuckin'
bullets in you, and he loves you?



Yeah, he loves me. I love him.



He's family. He's just a junkie.
He doesn't know what he's doing.



Live and let live. Speaking of which,
how many times I gotta tell you?



If you see me shot 20 times, if you
come in the room I got my head cut off...



- you don't call the cops.
- I know, Pop.



- Who do you call?
- I call Saul.



That's right.
Come here.



My fuckin' hand.
This fuckin' cousin of mine.



I swear to God,
I feel like killin' him.



- Can they do that?
- Do what?



- Go to my parole officer and get my bail revoked.
- Hell, no.



You didn't shoot nobody.
Somebody shot you.



- That trial ever gonna happen?
It's been a year already.
- They got no case.



That's why they
charge you under RICO.



Whenever the government has no case,
they charge you under RICO.



Aw, fuck them.



We gonna order some room service?



- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, this looks great.



- Muchas gracias.
- Gracias.



- Good evening.
- Stay where you are. Nice and easy, gentlemen.



You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...



can and will be held against you
in a court of law.



Do you understand that right?



You have the right to an attorney.



If you can't afford one, the court will
appoint you one. Do you understand that right?



Mr. DiNorscio. Mr. DiNorscio!



Mr. Rizzo, would you
wake your client up?



Twenty-two to 30 years...



for possession, sale and
distribution of narcotics.



And believe me, I'll try to see to it
that you do the full 30 years.



Let's go, Jackie.



Jesus, Sylvester.
A little privacy, please.



- Come on, Jackie Dee. You're going downtown.
- For what?



Damned if I know, but I'm sure as hell
I'm not standing here...



smelling your shit
while I argue with you.



- Let's go.
- Coming.



Sylvester, how long
we known each other?



On and off, uh, maybe eight years.



I'm a good guy, right?



Right.



- Everybody loves me.
- Right.



So why are you standing here bustin' my balls?
You can't let me finish takin' a crap?



You know, you're so full of it, you could
sit on that toilet forever. Let's go.



So where you guys taking me anyway?



Federal building.



For what?



I have no idea.



Hey, could you do me a favor,
roll down the window?



It's too cold.



Geez.



Thanks, fellas.



Wow, you guys expecting the
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District?



Giuliani said to start without him.



Okay.



- You got any ketchup?
- Oh, sorry. Just A-1 sauce.



A-1 sauce? A steak
should have ketchup.



- Please.
- All right.



- Ah, shrimp cocktail.
- Mm-hmm.



- A little wine?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.



So, car ride okay?



The car ride?



Oh, yeah, the fresh air felt good.



- The guys was real nice.
They lowered the window for me.
- Mm.



Well, I hope you
breathed nice and deep.



It could be your last
fresh air for 30 years.



Yeah, that judge shoved it right up my ass.
Can you believe that?



Doesn't have to be.



What doesn't have to be?



Thirty years.



- Got any more wine?
- Sure.



By the way, do you want
your lawyer here?



My lawyer?



I just got sentenced to 30 years
for a pissant dope deal...



'cause of that cocksucker.



So what do youse want?



You know what this is, Jackie?



Manhattan phone book?



Last year, you got indicted.



Fourteen counts.



"Gambling, racketeering,
narcotics distribution, conspiracy..."



That RICO thing?
That's a year old.



Counselor,
I completely forgot about it.



I mean, it's been so long.



And... everybody knows that those
RICO things are bullshit anyway, so...



Yeah, well, this one isn't bullshit.



It's not just you. Your boss,
your underboss, and 17 of your goombahs.



Twenty of you on 76 counts.
We're not fucking around, Jackie.



Mm-hmm.
So what do you need me for?



You're all going down.
You are all going down.



The whole New Jersey
Lucchese crew. We got it all.



Tapes, surveillance videos...



so many witnesses,
they're crawling out of the file cabinets.



Your cousin, your own fuckin' cousin,
Tony Compagna...



he's our star.



- My cousin Tony?
- Your fuckin'-A.



The trial starts next week.
And these pals of yours...



they're gonna be jumpin' over each
others' bodies just to make a deal.



So we get your testimony,you get time
lopped off this sentence. That simple.



You mean, I rat on my friends?



- You have no friends.
- What'd you say?



I have no friends?



Those guys love me, man. I love them.



- They love you?
- Mm-hmm.



For Christ's sakes,
you left the Bruno family.



Lots of guys get
whacked for doing less.



And what's worse,
you switched over to the Luccheses.



Trust me when I tell you they don't like
each other. The Brunos want you dead.



By the way, how did you get
from Brunos to Luccheses?



I took a cab.



You took a cab?



Now listen to me, you guinea cocksucker.
Don't fuck with me.



We're taking down the whole
fuckin' family, do you understand?



This trial's gonna
take at least a year.



76 counts, 20 defendants,
I don't know how many defense lawyers...



at least four prosecutors...



eight alternates on the jury
in case you fucks...



try to reach one of them
to get a mistrial.



This is the biggest thing
I'll ever have in my life.



Never lost a case.



And I sure as shit
won't start with this one.



I'm gonna watch all of you taking it
up the ass for the rest of your lives.



And that's the only kind oflove
you pricks are gonna get.



So what's your answer?



Fuck you.



Get this piece of shit out of here.



- Mr. Kierney.
- Yeah?



You got a brother?



Yeah.



Well, fuck him too.



You set up that meeting, didn't you?



Well, if somebody's gonna make a deal,
Jackie, I want it to be you.



Aw, fanculo, you motherfucker.



That's why they did the dope trial, so they
could use it to squeeze me on this one.



You should know that!



I've been in prison half my life.



- You think I'm gonna start making deals now?
- Listen, Jackie.



My job is to give you the best legal
advice I can. That's what you pay me for.



I paid you 250,000
for my last trial...



and I'm sitting here
holding my dick.



How much you wanna
charge me for this one?



- Look at all the work we've put in on this thing.
- How much you wanna charge me?



- Ah, 60,000, give or take a few.
- 60,000?



Take your fuckin' briefcase,
and get the fuck out of my cell.



Sylvester, get this piece
of shit out of my cell!



Jackie, pack up.
You're movin' out.



- Movin' out?
- Another cell block.



Is it bigger?



Oh, my God. Sylvester, listen.



My chair, I gotta have my chair.
I can't sleep without my chair.



- I'll talk to the guy.
- No, Sylvester. You don't understand.



I can't sleep without my chair.
I got a bad back. You see, when...



- What the hell are you still doing here?
- Aw, come on, Jackie.



- You owe me $60,000 for all the work I did so far.
- Oh, Rizzo.



Send me a bill. I'll wipe my ass with it.
Would that be okay?



- Oh, God.
- Get him the fuck out of here.



- He's all yours.
- Thanks, Jesse.



All the way to the end.



You wanna give me a hand?



Mr. Calabrese!



Mr. Calabrese has no comment
at the present time.



Mr. Calabrese,
is the third time a charm?



Justice will prevail, and my client
will be exonerated. Thank you very much.



Mr. Calabrese, you think
you're a three-time loser?



Oh, look at you.
You dressed up.



- Hey, good to see you.
- How you been, huh?



- Good luck, bro.
- Nice chatting with you.



- Okay.
- Hey, Jackie.



- How are you?
- How you doing? Good?



- Yeah, good to see you.
- All right, all right. Don't be too obvious.



- They let you in here?
- Good haircut.



- Thank you.
- You're gonna look beautiful on TV.



- Carlo, how you doing?
- My man.



Hey, Nick. Good to see you.



What's good about it?



Jackie? I'm Ben Klandis.



- I'm handling Carlo Mascarpone's defense.
- How you doing?



Listen, is it true you're
gonna defend yourself?



What do I need with a lawyer?
So he can get me another 30 years?



- Last trial, I had apnea. You know what apnea is?
- Yeah, I know what apnea...



It's like a sleeping sickness. It's like
I slept through the whole fuckin' trial.



I wake up, the judge
is sentencing me to 30 years.



The hammer comes down.



Bang! It felt like
it landed on my dick.



Nah, this time,
I take care of me myself.



Well, that's the problem.
It's not just you.



They get one of you for spitting on
the sidewalk, and all of you can go down.



R-I-C-O. The "C" in RICO,
it stands for conspiracy.



Conspiracy isn't hard to prove.
Two of you in the same room...



- that's conspiracy.
- I'm not gonna hurt nobody.



You're gonna have to go up against your
cousin, Tony Compagna. Ready for that?



That fucker's the reason
we're all here. He turned.



But you know what?
I'm gonna turn him back.



He's a junkie. Deep down inside
he loves me. He's mine.



Well, let me just, uh, get somebody to sit
with you so you don't make any legal errors.



It's a goddamn jungle in here.



Let me tell you something.



When they fucked with me...



they woke a sleeping giant.



I'll handle it.



All rise.



The honorable
Sidney Finestein presiding.



Be seated.



Members of the jury, by law,
you have to be able to see the witness box.



- Can you all see the witness box?
- Yes, Your Honor.



Defendants, defense attorneys...



you may have to shift in your seats
a little to see the witnesses.



Sorry, it's the best we can do.
We've never had so many defendants before.



Counselor.



Ladies and gentlemen.



"We own New Jersey!"



This is the boast of a mob family...



that controlled an endless
list of criminal activities.



The term "conspiracy" in Latin...



means to breathe together.



And these defendants breathed
a life of crime together.



Our evidence will show
that Carlo Mascarpone...



was the underboss of the New Jersey
faction of the Lucchese crime family.



The Luccheses,
one of the Five Families...



as vicious and dangerous
a crew as any in the nation.



Gino Mascarpone. Gino ran
the day-to-day gambling...



loan-sharking and extortion
activities for his boss, Nick Calabrese.



Danny Roma,
family soldier and enforcer.



Alessandro Tedeschi,
loan-sharking and gambling.



Tino Bellochio,
numbers and gambling.



Dominic Crespi, gambling and numbers.
Jackie DiNorscio, cocaine distribution.



You'll get to know the rest
as we drag them up to the witness box.



Liars, sociopaths, murderers.



- This guy thinks he's Eliot Ness.
- He's good.



Finally,you will hear
from Tony Compagna...



Jackie DiNorscio's own cousin.



It was Mr. Compagna that started
the ball rolling in this investigation.



A man, who fearing for his life...



agreed to cooperate and tell all he knew
about the inner workings of this mob...



this group of leeches
that suck money...



out of every enterprise,
legitimate or illegitimate...



to support their
extravagant lifestyles.



Now, we will be asking you...



to examine an awesome
amount of evidence.



And I am sorry about that.



But the severity of these crimes...



against the people of this community...



in fact, all America...



make it necessary
for you to do just that.



Thank you.



We will now hear opening statements
from defense counsels.



Mr. Cellano represents,
uh, defendant Dominic Crespi.



...the government's tapes,
you will conclude...



that my client is not guilty
of anything more than...



Since when is it a crime
to wear fancy clothes...



and an expensive diamond pinky ring
and drive a Cadillac?



If you arrested everyone who ever made
a friendly wager on a sporting event...



you'd have to lock up half of
the people in this courtroom.



- You're up soon. You ready?
- And all of this in 40 years of driving.



I got nothing written down.



Well, what are you gonna say then?



How the fuck do I know?
This whole case is a joke, right?



Mr. Klandis is representing
defendant Carlo Mascarpone.



Right in front of you,
ladies and gentlemen...



is this Latin motto,
whose translation is.;



"Let justice be done,
though the heavens may fall."



I have the fate
of Carlo Mascarpone in my hands.



There he is sitting near
his brother Gino.



They didn't join the Lucchese family,
because they already had one...



the family created
by Mr. and Mrs. Mascarpone.



It's called biology.



You'll hear a lot about
my client's flamboyant lifestyle.



His wife, Rosalynd,
sits in this courtroom...



married 17 years, four children.



That's a lifestyle.



He goes to St. Lucy's church.
His wife teaches C.C.D.



That's a lifestyle.



Many of these defendants are related,
some are friends or neighbors...



that have known each other since
playing Little League baseball together.



That's a lifestyle.



They are a family.



Not the kind of family
the government talks about.



They would twist it.
They would make it evil.



But all we're asking for,
ladies and gentlemen...



is to let justice be done,
though the heavens may fall.



Thank you.



Okay.
Let's see who's next.



Mr. DiNorscio.
Mr. DiNorscio.



Isn't your attorney here?



Well, Your Honor,
I think I'm-I'm better off...



Say that again.



Uh, I... I wanna go pro se.
I'm gonna be my own lawyer.



Do you know what "pro se" means?



- Sort of.
- What do you mean, "sort of"?



Uh, if you defend yourself, it's called
"pro se. " I'm gonna defend myself.



Mr. DiNorscio, in a case of this
magnitude, I don't think it's advisable.



My Sixth Amendment right.



I mean, I got the right to defend myself.
Am I correct, Judge?



Yes. Yeah, you're correct.
Have you had any legal experience?



Uh, well, sort of.



What do you mean, "sort of"?



I've been in prison half my life.



Sometimes I think
I had too much legal experience.



Mr. DiNorscio,
have you heard the saying...



that a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client?



Now I have. Is it true, Judge?



Sometimes it is.



So that means sometimes it ain't, right?



Okay.



- Thank you, Judge.
- But I don't think it's advisable. It's up to you.



Uh, Mr. DiNorscio, you're on.



Hi, I'm Jackie DiNorscio.



Uh, I'm defending myself
in this case.



You'll have to excuse me,
I'm a little nervous.



You see, I'm no lawyer.



I only have a sixth-grade education.



And, uh, I'm not sophisticated in the law
like some of these other persons here.



But what I tell you
will come from the heart.



Four months ago...



we started to pick jurors for this trial.



And I wanna say right now...



that I'm satisfied
with everybody on the jury.



And I wanna thank Mr. Klandis...



for translating that Latin slogan
in front of the judge.



I thought it meant "No smoking."



I was literally about to light up.



Like I said, uh...



I'm no lawyer...



uh, so I don't know where they
came up with this RICO law thing.



Should probably ask Mr. Kierney. I guess
if you're Italian,you should be in prison.



I've read the RICO Act, and
I can tell you it's more appropriate...



for some of those guys over in Washington
than it is for me or any of my fellas here.



- Are you through, Mr. DiNorscio?
- Uh, no, Judge.



How do I look, good?



You see this hat?



I'm wearing this hat
to make me look like a gangster.



'Cause that's what
that table wants me to be...



a gangster.



But I'm not a gangster,
ladies and gentlemen.



I'm a gagster.
This ain't even my hat.



Thank you, Mr. Washington.



Now, I'm sure Mr. Kierney...



will tell you I've been
in jail half my life, most of my life.



It's true.



I'd rather go to jail
for a thousand years...



than to ever rat
on any of my friends.



Do you know that this government...



this government offered me a deal...



to join their list of witnesses...



- and lie about these men here?
- Objection.



Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.



- What?
- You will confine the opening statement...



- But I...
- to the evidence to be presented.



Thank you, Judge.
I got it. Okay.



Ladies and gentlemen...



the evidence will show that they
wanted me to lie about my friends.



- Objection.
- Overruled.
- And I just could never do that.



I grew up with these guys.
How long I known you guys?



I've known them since
we were little babies.



I love these guys.
They're all I got.



But now all the prosecutor's got...



is a nutcase, two junkies
and a bank robber.



- Objection.
- Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.



I got this, Judge.



They talk about us being extravagant.
You hear him before?



"To support their
extravagant lifestyles."



Do I look extravagant?



One day, my wife asked me for $20
to buy a rump roast from the butcher.



I told her, "$20 for a rump roast?"



Of which I took her to the kitchen
where we got a full-length mirror.



I pull out a $20 bill out of my pocket.
I hold it up to the mirror.



I say, "Sweetheart, you see
that $20 bill in the mirror?



That one belongs to you.
This one belongs to me."



And I'm out of there. It's over.



The next day, ladies and gentlemen,
I come home...



and I see roasted meats from
one end of the table to the other.



And I asked her, I said, "Honey,
where'd all the meat come from?"



So she took me back over
to the full-length mirror.



She lifts up her dress,
ladies and gentlemen.



She points to the mirror
and she says...



"The one in the mirror
is yours, honey.



This one belongs to the butcher."



I mean, extravagant? Do I look extravagant?



- Mr. DiNorscio.
- I woulda wore a better suit.



Mr. DiNorscio!



Hey, all right. Everybody,
please quiet down.



Please, you'll all
get a ch... chance to talk.



Max, how do you think it went?



Well, I haven't had a chance to talk
to Nick yet, but all in all, not a bad day.



Ben, I thought you were terrific.



Chris, Frank, Henry,
all of you, good work.



Then that fuckin' lunatic gets up there,
and I don't know what to think anymore.



- I don't know if it's good or bad.
- Bad. All bad.



We got a major
RICO trial going on here...



and all of a sudden we gotta
contend with fuckin' Shecky Green.



Ben, the guy's
a time bomb out there.



You know the cliche, "Never ask a question
you don't know the answer to"?



He's gonna ask a question,
or he's gonna say something...



or something is gonna pop out of that
shit-hole of a mouth that he's got...



and we're gonna get hurt.



Well, see, you know,
I'm not sure I agree.



I was stealing looks at the jury.



They were with him.
They were laughing with him.



So let me throw that other
cliche out at you.



"A laughing jury
is never a hanging jury."



Let's sleep on this...



wait it out a couple of days,
see how it develops.



I can always rein him in later.



Nobody can take him seriously.
He's a clown up there.



- Jokes about his wife's twat. Are you kidding me?
- I agree.



I-In a week, they'll see him and
the rest of them for the morons they are.



I don't want 'em to see
those guys as morons.



I want that jury to see pimps, liars,
racketeers, arsonists and murderers.



It's an old saying,
but I believe it.



"A laughing jury
ain't a hanging jury."



- And he had 'em laughing.
- I don't agree at all, Sean.



Laughing at him can indicate
disrespect as well.



I don't know if you noticed, but a couple of
the women in the jury looked deeply offended.



- He'll step over the line. You'll see.
- It's an act.



No, it's not an act. That's what makes him
dangerous. He's like some '60s pop tune.



"All you need is love." Fuck.



Like some Deepak Chopra
with a pinky ring.



See you, Nick.
See you guys.



Good night, Nicky.



Counselor.



You're dead wrong, counselor.



You'll never rein him in.



He's fuckin' crazy.
I've known him a long time.



He's out for number one. He'll have
that jury laughin', and he'll get off.



And we'll be standin' there
with our dicks in our hand.



- Nick, see...
- Now, now, listen to me.



This is my fuckin' life on the line.



I gotta be sure. It looks
to me like he's hurting us.



- I'm separating him from the case.
- It's... It's not up to you.



- You wanna bet?
- Don't get stupid on me, Nick.



I'm a lot of things.
Stupid ain't one of them.



Have a good day, counselor.



Hey, Mickey. Aw.



You hungry?



Huh?



Thank you, Your Honor.



Mr. Juarez, is this
the agreement that you signed?



- Yes, sir.
- Now, Mr. Juarez...



you're here as a witness as part of a plea-bargain
agreement with the government, correct?



Yes, sir. I got busted.
And I was facing 40 years, so I flipped.



Regarding your narcotics sales...



you split the proceeds from those
transactions with Mr. DiNorscio.



- That's right.
- And how was Nick Calabrese involved?



I heard...
I heard he always got his cut.



- Objection. Hearsay.
- Sustained.



Just your personal
experience, Mr. Juarez.



- Did you ever meet Mr. Calabrese in person?
- Once.



I was at a birthday party for Jackie's
daughter, and he was there.



Jackie told me who Nick really was.



Why would Mr. DiNorscio confide in you?



Jackie and me,
we used to party together a lot.



We were doing coke.
We'd get high and...



when we had broads,
Jackie liked to nail 'em two at a time.



Thank you, Mr. Juarez.



- Mr. DiNorscio.
- You know, not for nothing, Judge...



but I thought this was the RICO Act,
not the Puerto Rico Act.



How you doing, pal?



Now, Octavio, let's be honest here.



- You and me, we did a lot of jobs together, right?
- Right.



You remember that one with Diego?



I sure do.



- Mind tellin' us about it?
- No you... you tell them.



- Tell the jury.
- No, you tell them.



I can't tell, Octavio.
I got my lawyer hat on.



Besides, if I tell it,
they're gonna think I'm bragging.



Well, you walk in...



and when their coke was on the table
next to our money...



- you pull a gun.
- And then what?



Diego says, "You only got
six shots in that thing...



- and there is seven of us."
- And?



I'll never forget it.



You said, "How about
if I shoot the six of you...



and strangle
the seventh motherfucker?"



- And we walk out, right?
- With the money and the coke.



Now, Octavio, have you ever...
I don't think anyone has...



- have you ever heard me
try to deny me using cocaine?
- No way.



No, of course not.
I wouldn't deny using cocaine ever.



I loved it.
In fact, did you bring any?



What did he say?
I didn't hear the punch line.



The main point was to tie
Calabrese to Jackie. We got that.



And, Peter,
call Manhattan Correctional.



- Fuckin'Jackie's got himself set up like he was at a hotel.
- Okay.



- Tell 'em I don't want him too comfortable.
- Got it.



Hey, Jackie.
How was court today, man?



- I killed 'em again.
- Good.



- Jesse, where's my lounger?
- The word come down, Jackie.
You live like everybody else.



Yeah, but I can't... I can't sleep
layin' down. I gotta sleep half sitting.



Tough tittie, Jackie Dee.
Them's the conditions which prevail.



Hey, Jesse, you know my back!



How the hell am I
supposed to sleep, Jess?



Aw,you'll figure it out.



Mr. Bellman, how did you
come to know Mr. DiNorscio?



Uh, when I got paroled,
I had no job, no money, nothing.



And a friend of mine
hooked me up with Jackie.



I lived with him
in Florida for a while.



And what was your
relationship with him?



I was a gofer. I, uh, I drove him around,
picked up guns for him...



and I gave rides to his friends, and, uh,
I brought messages back and forth...



from him and some of
these defendants here.



And did you ever see
any drug transactions take place?



I was there when they were
cuttin' up the money.



And to the best of your knowledge,
how was that money distributed?



Uh, me and Jackie got a share.



Jimmy the Jew got his.



I mean, uh, Jimmy Katz.



And, uh, of course the boss,
Nick Calabrese, got the big cut.



Did you witness this?



Jackie and Jimmy, yes.



- Not Nick.
- Move to strike as hearsay.



Sustained.
Strike the reference to Mr. Calabrese.



And when did your relationship
with Mr. DiNorscio end?



Well, you see, Jackie started
gettin' nutty from all the coke.



One Christmas, he wanted me
to get chickens to cook for a party.



I got tired of runnin'
errands for him.



When I didn't get the chickens,
he threw me out of the house.



That's the last I saw of him.



Thank you, Mr. Bellman.
Your witness.



Now, tell the truth, Harry.



Isn't the real reason
I threw you out of that house...



'cause I refused sexual
advances from you to me?



- What? Objection!
- Sustained.



Now, Harry, isn't it true that the guys
in jail used to call you Mary?



- Objection.
- No, that's not true!



Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.



I warned you.



Harry, when you got out of prison...



isn't it true you didn't
have a dime to your name?



Didn't I take you in?
Didn't I treat you good?



- And this is how you pay me back, by rattin'?
- You treated me like dirt.



You come here and you say that I committed
these crimes after I treated you like a brother.



- Didn't I feed you?
- Yeah, I feed my dogs too.



Look, Harry, how could this jury be sure you're
telling the truth about me breaking the law...



when half the time you were
high from shootin' drugs?



- Objection.
- That's a lie.



Mr. DiNorscio. You have to prove
that statement before you try to use it.



I will, Judge.



Come on, Harry.
Roll up your sleeve.



Show the needle marks to the jury.



- Hey, stay away from me. Stay a-
- Come on, Harry.



Stay away.



That Christmas...



wasn't the real reason
I threw you out of that house...



'cause I woke up one morning and
caught you tryin' to give me a blow job?



Mr. DiNorscio!



- Isn't that the truth, Harry?
- Come on, Jackie. Look at yourself.
You kidding me?



I'm not kidding you.



I see the way you look at me.
I know what's on your mind.



You wanna suck on this
instead for a while?



Mr. DiNorscio should be
held in contempt of court.



Remove the jury!



Lunch. Two hours.



Jackie, Jackie. What a fuckin'job
you're doin; man.



- You're wearing 'em out.
Keep it up. Love you, baby.
- All right.



Ben. Ben.



Can you do me a favor?



I don't think so.



Why?
What the hell did I do?



Two ladies on the jury were looking at you
as if they wouldn't pick you up with tongs.



I can't let my client
be affected by your behavior.



You damn well better control
yourself or you're on your own.



Okay, okay, I got it.



Can you help me out, Ben?



What is it?



I wanna have lunch with the fellas.



Every day my marshals take me
down to the holding cell.



Technically,
you're still a prisoner, Jackie.



You think I don't know that?



Ben, Ben. I asked them this morning
if I could have lunch with the fellas.



I grew up with most of them.
By now they're family.



If it's okay with your marshals,
it's okay with me.



- Hey!
- Hey, Jackie.



You guys save any for me? Huh?



Hiya, Nick.



What are you doing here?
You eat downstairs in the holding cell.



No, my marshal said it was okay
if I ate with you guys.



Nobody cleared it with me.



- I didn't know it had to be cleared with you, Nick.
- Now you know.



You know, Nick, I don't know why
you're giving me such a hard time.



- I love these guys.
- Stop with the love shit, Jackie.



You're so full of shit. What, because
we're from the same neighborhood?



I didn't trust you when you was a kid.
I don't trust you now.



What the fuck are you talkin' about?
You got no reason to say that.



I got no reason?
I got no fuckin' reason?



I see you up there
kissin' ass so you can walk.



You'll suck cock to walk.
You're the faggot, not Bellman.



Now, why don't you
get the fuck out of here?



What, do I stutter?



- Coffee, sir?
- Salami on ham.



Agent Kerry...



you conducted
many hours of surveillance...



on each one of these defendants...



- on trial here today, correct?
- I did.



And did the F.B.I. conclude...



that an organized crime family
existed in northern New Jersey...



- under the leadership of Nick Calabrese?
- Yes, that is correct.



And how did you determine
that Calabrese was the boss?



Well, I was in a restaurant
in Bloomfield on...



September 19 of last year.



It had a reputation
as being a mob hangout.



Why did it have that reputation?



Because the food was good.



No interruptions.



Thank you, Your Honor.
Go on, sir.



I was at the bar. Uh, you could see
a large, private dining room at the back.



The doors were open, and two very...



well, heavyset gentlemen
in tuxedoes stood by the door.



In the dining room, you could see
a birthday party was going on.



How did you know
it was a birthday party?



They were all wearing paper hats and they had
those things that when you blow on them...



they uncurl and go...



- These were children?
- No, sir.



No, sir.
These were grown men.



- Go on.
- Well, at the head of a horseshoe table...



sat, uh, Mr. Calabrese.



And as I observed, all these Italian males
lined up to kiss his ring.



It was obvious to me
that they were paying respects...



to Mr. Calabrese as being the boss.



It was like out of the movies.
There was no other conclusion.



Thank you, Agent Kerry.



- Mr. Klandis?
- No questions, Your Honor.



Mr. Novardis?



I have nothing for this witness,
Your Honor.



- There are no further questions.
- I'd like to ask him something.



- Mr. DiNorscio.
- Thank you, Your Honor.



Mr. Kerry, I was wondering
about something.



Could you tell all of us how you knew that
those men in that restaurant was Italian?



Well, it... Uh.



I-You know, I guess that...



Hey, they all looked Italian to me.



- Wow.
- You know...



with the hand gestures and the back
slapping and the kissing and everything.



Did they teach you that in F.B.I. school
that that's how Italians act?



No. No, that's not part
of our training. No.



- You speak Italian?
- No.



No?



Could you hear them
talking in Italian?



No, I was too far away.



See, I-I'm not understanding this.



You're saying from the back slapping and
the kissing, you knew that they were Italian?



- Well, it was an Italian restaurant.
- Did they all have black hair?



Uh, yeah, yeah.
From what I can remember, yeah.



Could they have been
Spanish, Greek, Jewish?



Not with Nick Calabrese
at the head of the table, no.



You saying Nick
only eats with Italians?



No, I'm not saying that.



What if I told you
I went into a restaurant...



and there was nothing
but Irish guys there?



And you says,
"How'd you know they were Irish?"



And I says, "'Cause they were all drunk,
vomiting all over the floor."



Objection, Your Honor.
Badgering the witness.



- Mr. DiNorscio.
- No, it's all right, Judge.



Look, Mr. DiNorscio. If it walks
like a duck, looks like a duck...



quacks like a duck,
chances are it's a duck.



If it talks like an asshole,
looks likes an asshole...



chances are it's an asshole.



Objection. This behavior cannot be tolerated.



Mr. DiNorscio, I am fining you
$5,000 for contempt of court.



That's what I got, Your Honor.
I got contempt for this court.



You should've stopped him before
with all the Italian shit.



You are now fined 10,000.



Wanna try for 15?



If there are no further questions, I want
to warn the defendants right now...



that if they keep up
this raucous behavior...



they will be liable for contempt
charges with heavy fines.



And you defense attorneys will be
liable to contempt as well...



for not keeping
your clients under control.



Sidebar, my chambers.



Jackie. Jackie.



Jerk-off, don't
say my name ever again.



You say my name again,
I'll cut your fuckin' heart out.



I've done it before.
I'd be thrilled to do it again.



Jackie, what...



what the fuck do you think
you're doing up there?



What?
I speak my mind.



You can kick his dog,
you can spit in his face...



but the one thing a judge never wants
to hear is criticism about his court.



Fuck him. He ain't the jury.
What the fuck could he do?



Jackie, your ignorance is
second only to your arrogance.



Mr. Klandis, how do you think
Mr. DiNorscio's behavior...



is affecting the jury's relationship to
your client and the other defendants?



- Your Honor...
- Don't say a word, Mr. DiNorscio.



Not a word.
Mr. Klandis.



He's clearly a disruptive force.



- Mr. Kierney.
- He undermines the authority of your court.



And if I may say so, you'd never permit
such behavior from a regular attorney.



See any solution?



If he were just the defendant, you could put him
in another room. They both watch it on TV.



But he's his own lawyer.



Unfortunately,
it seems to me there's no choice.



He has to be severed
from this trial and tried separately.



Mr. Klandis?



It's extreme,
but I'm not against it.



I have no idea what
the legal consequences would be.



I'll put my clerk to work on it.



All right, we ready for the jury?



Judge.



Yes, Mr. DiNorscio?



Can I talk to you?



I wanna apologize
for my action in court before.



I want you to understand...



whatever I said,
I meant no disrespect to you.



I respect you more than any other judge
I ever faced, and I faced a lot of them.



Okay, well, thank you,
Mr. DiNorscio.



I was out of line before.



I agree I should be held in contempt.



All right. Bring in the jury.



Jurors, jurors, will you please take
your seats as quickly as possible?



What's going on? You all right?



What's the matter?



I need an opening. Break this up,
here. Come on. E.M.T.



There you go.
There you go. Okay.



I need some room.



I need some room, guys.
Please, give me some room.



Can you breathe?



Watch his head.
Watch his head.



- Bring him all the way up, all the way up.
- Is he in trouble?



You're gonna be all right,
Tommy. Don't worry.



The paramedics are gonna take care of you.



Nappy, want me to call your mother?



Nappy.
All right. Nappy.



Okay.



There, uh, won't be any test results
before Friday, maybe even Monday.



So let's adjourn
until we get...



Your Honor, this trial
is over 11 months old.



We haven't even reached
the halfway mark in our presentation.



Mr. Kierney, I'm not used
to being interrupted.



You are the one who handed in
a witness list of more than 89 people...



and you have already introduced
more than 450 exhibits...



and I am told there are
hundreds more coming...



so let us not complain
about a lengthy trial.



A defendant is sick and he is gonna get
a fair shake in my courtroom, understood?



The clerk will notify you about our next
meeting. Have a good night, gentlemen.



Nappy Napoli.
How do you like that?



- Boy, oh, boy, time is fleeting.
- Time is what?



Fleeting.
Time is fleeting.



What the hell does that mean,
"Time is fleeting"? What's fleeting?



Fleeting. It's like fleeing.
Time is fleeing.



But it's in the past tense,
so they say "fleeting."



You're full of shit.



You're an ignorant slob.



You look good.



You got everything you need?
You're okay on money?



Yeah. Stop worrying
about me, Pop. I'm fine.



How's your brother doing?



Good, I guess. I mean, you know,
I don't really see him too much.



- I worry about him.
- You worry about everything.



Only family.
That's all that matters.



The rest of it's a fart in a hurricane.



- How's your mama doing?
- She looks good. I see her all the time.



- Yeah?
- Yeah.



Say hello for me.



I don't know, Pop. I mean, the last time
I did that she kind of gave me that look...



like I should never say it again.



She's tough.
Boy, is she tough.



You know what the two best words
in the English language are?



Things change.



Okay. First, about Mr. DiNorscio.



Because he's both
a defendant and an attorney...



I think separating him out
at this point...



will make an appeal by
the losing side almost inevitable.



Anyone wanna go through this again?



No.
So he stays.



But I promise you this,
Mr. DiNorscio.



If you are as disruptive
as you have been in the past...



you are out like that.



And to hell with what happens later.



You got me?



Second, trial resumes on Monday.
I've spoken with the doctors.



They feel Mr. Napoli is fully capable of
understanding the proceedings around him.



Your Honor, he can't even sit up.



Arrange for his hospital bed to be
brought into the courtroom.



Your Honor, he's under
heavy medication.



The doctors are cutting it
way back this weekend.



- He falls asleep when I talk to him.
- Make yourself more interesting.



Now, look, goddamn it.
We're a year in.



This trial is going forward.
Monday, 10:00 a.m.



Hey, there's Tommy Napoli!



- I'm glad to see youse guys.
- Look at these shoes.



All rise.



Nappy Napoli can't rise.
Is it all right if he stays layin' down?



Mr. DiNorscio.



Be seated.



You can see their autos
parked here near the entrance.



There are two Lincolns...



and one, two, three Cadillacs...



as well as other
vehicles parked nearby.



We continued our surveillance
until Mr. Mascarpone and Mr. Roma...



got in their cars and left...



nine hours later at 4:00 a.m.



Agent Petraki, when you arrested
my client, Carlo Mascarpone...



- did he resist in any way?
- No.



I had a very pleasant conversation
with Mr. Mascarpone.



And what did you talk about?



We discussed political
philosophy and history.



I found out that he was
a great admirer of Machiavelli.



So you discussed Machiavelli. No discussions
of shakedowns, payoffs or rubouts, correct?



That's correct. But since I once taught
a class in political philosophy...



I thought it ironic that Carlo Mascarpone
was an admirer of Machiavelli...



whose major theme was that
"power corrupts...



and absolute power
corrupts absolutely."



I felt that perhaps Mr. Mascarpone
applied Machiavelli's ideas...



to his own line of work
as a mob boss.



Your Honor, my next line of questioning
could take some time.



It's so close to lunch, would anybody
object if we took an hour now?



Any objections?



One hour.



Do you see this book?



It's called
Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.



Do you know who Lord Acton was?



- Lord Acton?
- A-C-T-O-N, Acton.



- No, sir.
- Well, he was English.



He lived from 1834 to 1902.



That's 300 years after Machiavelli.



And it's right here
on page 39, it says...



"Lord Acton is the author
of the quote...



'Power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely."'



Not Machiavelli.



No further questions, Your Honor.



Mr. DiNorscio?



- Mr. Petraki, you was a college teacher?
- Yes.



Now, in those courses
that you taught...



In what was it, politics?



- Machiavelli's a big deal, am I right?
- A very big deal.



I mean, we're not talking about
a made guy in the Lucchese family.



No, we are not.



So, my question is...



how could you make
a mistake like that?
