Moron!
What are these?
Stop the presses!
Stop the presses!
Martin! Stan Martin!
Where are you?
- Yes, Sir, Mr. Perkins.
- What's this?
A banana.
I know it's a banana,
what's this?
- Those would be bruises, Sir.
- Bruises?
Yeah, I thought it might appear
more realistic...
if the fruit had bruises on them.
Come here, Stan.
Alright, where is it?
- Alright, what's this?
- That's my bruised banana.
No!
That's my bruised banana.
I came up with the whole concept
back in 1997.
You see, the whole idea was to alternate
your fruit incrementally...
from fresh, to right, to rotten.
Giving the customer
the total wax fruit experience.
Wow!
That's brilliant.
Thanks.
- Why didn't you go ahead with it?
- Feldman shot it down.
He said, "You know,
in forty five years...
we never had a Feldman banana
with a bruise on it."
So if it ain't broke...
Henry!
- Now?
- Right now.
- Okay. Alright.
- You're already late.
Alright, I'm going.
Trust is the key
to every great relationship.
Even the tragic ones.
There was "trust"
when Eve gave Adam that apple.
When Delilah cut Samson's hair.
There was even "trust" when Ross
screwed around on Rachel...
when he thought they were
on "a break".
But what these couples
didn't do is...
- "communicate".
- You're late.
We had a rush order
on kumquats.
I tried that, alright, but it just
blows up in my face, you know.
And she's all mad because
I'm checking out some websites.
- What kind of websites?
- Smokinghotchicks.com.
- My God.
- Let's put a pin in here.
Welcome, Henry.
Now, in our last session...
Carol was concern that Henry is
"a creature of habit."
- Yes.
- Look, Mr. Rogers...
- Doctor Rogers.
- Whatever.
Can we go on to someone else
first, please?
You see, Henry's hidden self
is his true self...
which is true
for all of ourselves.
But we see his false self,
which manifests itself...
in his ritualistic,
routine, compulsive behavior.
Yes, that's true.
Henry never takes any chances.
There's no spontaneity
in our lives.
- No "joi du vivre."
- Jua-da-what?
Let's see.
It's Bumble Bee Tuna
everyday for lunch.
6:30, Miller Lite time.
8:00, Nick at Nite for dinner.
And the best of Tom Jones CD
before bed.
- Tom Jones?
- It's like living with Rain Man.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Well, today's his birthday.
- Happy Birthday.
And you know what he wants?
The exact same
brown lamb's skin briefcase.
I don't know, perhaps you rather discuss
Carol's collection of phallics?
Phallics?
They're not phallics,
they're nudes!
Whatever you call them,
they're just a bunch of shlongs!
Do you use live models?
Carol's been painting and sculpturing
naked people forever...
but she never shows them
to anybody.
Well, someone please tell him
that takes years to be discovered!
Because if you ever need
a volunteer...
What?
She's a fine artist.
Thank you.
Lord knows, I mean,
every Friday...
she drags her portfolio down
to the art galleries...
but never steps inside.
I have problems...
dealing with rejection.
Please, don't cry.
She cries at the drop of a hat.
Obviously,
Carol's hidden self...
is afraid to express her personal,
exhibitionist wishes.
You see, everything we do
is a window into our subconscious.
Now pay attention,
because there will come a time...
where you will be able
to look into that window...
and see who you are and why...
and in that
"transformative moment"...
your life will become clear.
I want you all to read my new book.
It's only US$29,95...
and it's signed.
"The Transformative Moment".
It'll swag the bookstores.
Henry, hey!
Hi, birthday boy.
Hey, Vic.
Carol says I'm too predictable,
which is a croak...
but since you know me
longer than anybody...
- I value your opinion the most.
- Okay.
Quit tapping the pencil,
okay, Ringo.
And then wipe the white powder
off your lips...
from your daily doughnut fix...
before someone thinks
you've been blowing a kabuki.
- I knew I could count on you, Vic.
- Hey, waiter, where's my espresso?
Hey, Henry, I gotta go.
Good you call.
See you tonight!
Thank you. Your check.
Okay, that's 1200.
- What?
- Guavas.
- The good ones.
- Coming through.
Mr. Feldman?
And I want those reports on my desk
in 24 hours! You got that?
- Now run along!
- Right away, Sir.
- Henry!
- Yes.
- I want to talk to you!
- Yes, Sir.
Are you responsible
for the bruises on these bananas?
No, Sir.
That's Martin's...
Stan Martin. Yes.
- In fact, I was just going to...
- Well, commend that son of a bitch.
The best god damn idea
I've seen in twenty two years.
- Now you like it?
- You bet your ass!
Change the whole line.
And bump it up another 300 gross.
You know, since my Zoe died,
I'm wearing nothing but costume made.
That's what this is all about.
Change.
That's what keeps
the spirit going...
that's what keeps
your "schvantz" growing.
Not to mention
a little help from...
the blue boys.
You gotta try some, Henry? They'll turn
your dick into the Terminator.
Well, that sounds very tempting, Sir,
but, no, thank you.
- And give that guy...
- Martin?
Martin! Yeah. Give him a raise,
but not too much!
- Yes, Sir.
- Alright, baby!
- Coming through, Mr. Feldman.
- Right! "Viva la vida!"
I'd like to remind you,
in 1997...
Fuck it.
Taxi!
- I'm so sorry.
- My Gosh! No, it's my fault...
- No, no.
- Please, forgive me.
You know, my husband
has this same briefcase.
- I just bought from on sale...
- Sale at Saks! I know.
It's kind of masculine,
but I think it's sexy.
Here you go.
Interesting.
Oh my God,
you're Madame Virginia.
Very nice.
These are excellent.
Is this you?
No!
Well, I'm the artist, so,
artistically speaking, they're "me."
Why? Do you like them?
Hold on, right?
Folks, keep moving.
Clear the doors.
21st. Street.
Next stop, 21st. Street.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I don't know.
Henry!
Henry!
Come to Paradise, Henry!
"Transformative moment",
your life will become clear.
"Transformative moment".
"Transformative moment".
Your life will become clear.
"Transformative moment".
- "Transformative moment".
- "Transformative moment".
- "Transformative moment".
- "Transformative moment".
- Your life will become clear.
- "Transformative moment".
Clear. Clear.
Clear.
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Here, why don't you sit down?
Thank you, Sir.
- Can you take this for me, thank you.
- Here you go.
Hey, watch it!
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?
- I didn't mean it.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Alright. Are you alright?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Have a nice day.
- Keep the change. Thank you.
- Thanks for the tip, lady.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Wong.
Of course, we're still on. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
You know, just don't come before
8:30 or you'll spoil the surprise party.
Yeah, I'm going to leave
the front door open for the guests...
but I'd like you to come in
through the back door, okay?
Yeah.
No, I'm looking forward to it.
Yes, I know your food
is delicious.
Through here.
And the second one
right to the back of the TV. Right.
Alright, come on.
Push the furniture back.
First, let's get the other one.
- How you doing, Henry?
- The usual, Tony.
- One Bud Lite coming up.
- Wait a minute. Make it a Tuborg.
Creature of habit my ass.
Tuborg?
- Tuborg it is.
- I never lock my briefcase.
Honey, where have you been?
You were supposed to be home
over an hour ago.
I mean, Vic and Gina
will be here any minute.
For your birthday dinner!
I mean, at least
you could have called.
What, did you miss the train?
Say something!
Yellow pages.
Yellow pages? Why do you want
the Yellow Pages?
- Were you in an accident?
- Let's see, travel agents.
No. They'd be closed by now.
- The airlines!
- The airlines?
What do you want the airlines for?
When you know Vic and Gina are coming?
Hello? Delta?
I knew it.
- I'd like to get two tickets please.
- Tickets?
- For tonight.
- What?
Anywhere in Europe.
Anywhere that's a hub.
London, Paris, Baghdad...
Strike that.
Calcutta?
- Don't we need shots for that?
- What's the matter with you?
- Are you on something?
- What's the departure time?
Hang on.
How long is it going to take to get
to Newark Airport from here?
- You've been drinking!
- By taxi?
No, I can smell it
on your breath!
Don't hang up.
- Hang up the phone!
- Don't hang up!
Eight o'clock, taxi, eight thirty,
Newark, check in, security.
- I'd say by ten.
- I'm going to start getting angry...
- very, very soon!
- Hold on one second.
Don't hang up.
Carol, go pack.
Trust me.
Is this a joke?
Because if it's, it isn't funny.
Just pack one suitcase!
A small one.
Yeah, we'd like to make that
first class.
Just a change of underpants and we'll
buy everything else when we get there.
- Get where?
- Barcelona?
Excellent!
- 2200 hours. 2215 hours.
- Henry?
Excuse me, what's that
in real people time, you know?
- Ten fifteen p.m., excellent!
- Please, Henry, you're scaring me!
It's Perkins.
What?
No, one way only.
We're not coming back.
Carol, please, sweet,
I promise I'll tell you everything.
I'll explain it all.
Hello, Hoboken Cab?
Yes.
I need a car right away
to take two of us to Newark Airport.
Fifteen minutes, excellent!
Perkins, Forty Sinatra Drive.
Great, thanks.
- Henry!
- Carol! Carol, just listen.
No, you listen! You've been drinking
and it's affected your brain.
- Nothing's affected my brain.
- Booking one way tickets to Barcelona...
when we have dinner guests coming,
that's normal?
You know what? I think this is what
Doctor Rogers warned us about.
A mid-life crisis.
You think your life
is going nowhere.
It's probably not serious,
just a temporary breakdown.
I don't think it's a blood clot.
- What's that?
- What does it look like? It's money.
- What is it?
- It's five million dollars.
In cash and bearer bonds.
- But what is it?
- It's money, honey!
Moola!
Our ship has come in, honey!
We just have hit
the Donald "Freaking" Trump jackpot.
"He's fired."
Passports!
- How did this get into your briefcase?
- It's not my briefcase.
What do you mean?
Look, I was coming home on the train
like I always do.
And somehow I ended up with some guy's
briefcase that's exactly like mine.
- Why didn't you give it back to him?
- To who?
I didn't know it wasn't my briefcase
until I saw the five million.
How do you know
the exact amount?
- I counted it.
- On the subway?
No, on the toilet
at Barney's Tavern.
I knew you were drinking!
It's my "transformative moment",
as Mr. Rogers said.
Oh my God!
I don't believe it!
You okay, man?
Yes.
There I am, there it was.
- But it's not our money.
- It is now, go and pack.
Come on!
- It's stealing!
- Oh no!
I've give it
a lot of thought, Carol.
I figure the money's already
been stolen.
All unmarked bills,
bundled up in rubber bands.
Probably a payoff
to some drug dealer or something.
And I don't think anybody is thinking
about paying taxes on it.
Therefore,
the money doesn't exist.
And if it doesn't exist,
what did I steal!
Nothing!
Nada!
Zouch!
Zero!
Doughnut.
But, Henry.
This is insane!
My conscience is clear, Carol!
You know what? I've worked very hard
for more than twenty years.
I've devoted my life
to the artificial fruit business...
and at long last I've finally got
my golden apple...
and you know something?
It's not wax!
It's real.
- Okay?
- Well, wait.
We can't just fly to Barcelona
at a moment's notice.
Why not?
You want to go someplace else?
How about Bali?
Hell, honey, we can buy Bali!
- What about our family?
- What family?
I mean, no kids.
You're an orphan.
And my folks are dead.
No, they're not.
They're retired in Florida.
- Same thing.
- Well, and what about the police?
The police will never
get involved in this...
because nobody will ever report
this money missing.
Well, there's another reason
that I need to stay here tonight.
And that is that I finally showed
my artwork today to someone...
- and...
- No!
Are you nuts?
We can't even stay on the country.
I go to the office tomorrow,
I'm a dead man.
- Did you insult Mr. Feldman again?
- Not Mr. Feldman.
Mr. Nasty!
I have his briefcase.
If I have his briefcase, he has mine.
It's got all my stuff in it.
Tomorrow he will come to the office
looking for me and his briefcase.
But, by then,
we'll be thousands of miles away...
booked in some Spanish hotel
as Mr. and Mrs. Cha, cha, cha.
"Olé!"
What are you guys doing
down there?
- Get out of there!
- I'm calling the cops.
It's not unusual to be rich
Like no one else
Henry, I've never seen you
like this before.
That's because I've never felt
like this before.
How about a quickie?
Come on, I do all the work.
Henry, this isn't the time!
You're right. You're right.
The cab will be here any second.
I got an idea.
We can do it in the taxi
on the way to the airport.
But, Henry, something wonderful
happened to me today.
I'll say, we're rich!
- Oh, God!
- That'll be Vic and Gina.
You lose them,
I'll continue packing.
What will I tell them? They think
they're coming for pot roast.
I got it.
Here.
Tell them to go to the Rainbow Room.
It's on me!
I can't believe this.
Sorry it took me so long, I...
I thought you were...
I was expecting someone else.
Detective Sergeant Genero.
Hoboken Police.
Is there a problem, officer?
It's better I speak with the guy
who just came in here, Ms...
- Mrs. Perkins...
- Yeah.
My husband's upstairs at the moment,
but he'll be down shortly.
- Would you like a nut?
- No.
God, I'm so sorry.
They're honey glazed.
So they're a little sticky.
There's one on your...
I'm sorry for that. Henry!
That's my husband, Henry.
And those are probably
our friends Vic and Gina.
So, please, please,
would you please sit down?
Or don't.
Henry!
We're having dinner
here tonight.
Me and Henry.
Vic and Gina.
- It's his birthday.
- That's good.
- It's Henry's birthday, not Vic's.
- Lady, the door.
Sure.
I'm sure he'll be down
just momentarily...
because he's changing
in his birthday suit.
Gosh, he doesn't have
any clothes on.
Hey, are you people deaf or what?
- What?
- You don't turn it up to nine, lady.
I thought you were...
You thought I'll be here
in fifteen minutes but I made it in ten.
Just remember that when it's time
to tip the brother, alright?
Excuse me?
- I am your cab driver.
- Right, the taxi cab.
You know, actually
I'm stand-up comic, you know.
- By now I'm doing a sit down.
- How nice.
That's right,
I'll be a huge star, lady.
- Where are your bags?
- Bags?
Yeah, bags, lady,
and I'm not talking paper or plastic.
Hey, that's funny.
That kills at the Safeway.
Okay, where's your luggage
to airport?
The cab's not for me.
It's for my...
my sister.
Yeah, yes, she's staying with us,
but she'll be leaving tonight.
Wait, wait, wait,
the pick up here says, "Mr. Perkins".
No, no, no,
Mr. Perkins isn't going anywhere.
He just made the booking.
- He has no reason to leave.
- Alright.
Listen,
why don't you wait in the taxi...
- Angel.
- Angel, beautiful name.
My husband will down in a jumpy.
My sister isn't quite ready yet.
Where are they flying to?
What terminal?
I'm sorry?
Your sister.
What's her destination?
Australia.
Yes, yes, she's been here visiting us
and now she'll be returning...
to Sydney.
- Good. Down under?
- That's right.
Look, you tell
Mr. and Mrs. Crocodile Dundee...
- There's a Mr. and Mrs.?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The pick-up says two people.
Of course, because that's my sister,
Leslie, and her husband...
Chris.
Chris!
- Yes!
- Great.
I'll be parked around the corner.
Okay, alright, see you.
In just... when my sister...
Okay, all packed! Just underpants,
deodorant and toothpaste.
- Honey?
- Yeah.
We have a visitor.
A visitor?
Oh, great, the cabbie!
- Detective Sergeant Genero.
- Really?
What's seems to be
the problem, detective?
It's my tune playing too loud again,
the neighbors complain, I know.
No, if your Mrs. doesn't mind,
I think it's better...
if we discuss our business
in private.
I'll just wait until
your sister-in-law is gone.
Sister-in-law?
- He's referring to Leslie.
- Leslie?
Yeah, she said they're
just about to leave.
- When he says "they"...
- Leslie and Chris.
- Leslie and Chris.
- Back down under.
- Back down under?
- Down under... Sydney.
Leslie, Chris and Sydney?
Thanks for bringing
their luggage down, honey.
My pleasure.
I don't think the Sergeant needs
to wait for Leslie and Chris to leave...
- do you?
- Absolutely not.
- That must be the cab.
- Angel's already here.
- Who's Angel?
- The cab driver.
But he's really a stand-up comic.
Then it's probably Vic and Gina then.
Get rid of them.
But we've invited them
to your birthday dinner.
Tell them, you know,
to leave their presents and go.
I want to keep my wife
for myself tonight, you know.
It's my birthday, not Vic's.
They'll understand.
Just tell them we're going to bed.
After I've satisfied
the Sergeant.
When I say satisfied,
sounds funny, I mean...
after I've helped him
in whatever the help needs.
Please.
- Henry, I can't cope!
- Yes, you can't.
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.
She can.
She just thinks she can't.
Maybe I better answer the door.
Would you mind waiting in the kitchen?
- Don't be long, Perkins.
- I won't.
You said Mr. Nasty
wouldn't go to the cops.
Who said he did?
Why else would he want
to see you alone?
He doesn't know this isn't
my life savings.
Five million dollars?
- I've been frugal.
- I need a drink.
- You don't drink.
- I don't care.
Pull yourself together, Carol.
This is the happiest day of our lives.
Hey! You know
the meter's ticking, right?
- Meter?
- In the taxi, man.
Look here, I know waiting is part
of my job, but I hate waiting.
Unless it's for the lotto or a female
with some tigle bitties, who's easy.
You must be the hack comic, right?
Yeah, right, okay, get the suitcase.
- What about the policeman?
- Police? Now cops make me nervous.
The last time I got pulled over
for drunk driving...
a cop made me blow up a balloon.
- So what?
- It was the Goodyear blimp.
Then I got out and he said
I was too drunk to even walk.
I said, "Why the heck
do you think I'm driving?"
Very funny.
Okay, just wait in the taxi,
will you, Def Jam?
What about your in-laws,
are they going?
It's the in-laws that are going,
it's the outlaws.
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Whatever.
I can't go through with this.
It's making me a nervous wreck.
It's already driven me to drink.
You go without me.
How many times
do I have to tell you, Carol?
Tomorrow morning, Mr. Nasty
will call my office and get our address.
If he comes here
and you're still here...
he'll put you in the Cuisinart
and set to frappe...
and will chop, dice and stir you
into minced housewife.
And that'll be all
thanks to you.
- So they left?
- Who's that?
- Your wife's sister and her husband.
- Mr. and Mrs...
- Chris and Leslie.
- Chris and Leslie.
It's the last name that gets
the pronunciation thing...
Brown! That's right.
Sometimes I say Brom or Groim.
Oh, my God!
Carol, you're a bundle of nerves.
It's just Vic and Gina.
Don't forget to tell them you're
my surprise birthday present in bed!
Henry!
She's so jumpy.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, Gina!
I say "we", but that stupid
husband of mine...
is down in the street
yelling at a cabbie.
A cabbie?
He hit a taxi that was parked
on the street. Some little black guy.
- Of course Vic called him a...
- Angel!
No, I believe it was
a four letter word.
Gina, it's terrible.
Henry's gone crazy.
He's in the kitchen now with the police.
Have I missed
a couple of sentences here?
- He stole five million dollars!
- Who has?
- Henry!
- Henry stole five million dollars?
He picked up the wrong briefcase,
went to a bar...
saw all this money,
and sat on the toilet, overcome...
You know, whole paragraphs
are disappearing now.
I was on a stakeout
tonight over Barney's Tavern.
- Barney's?
- Yeah.
I observed some pretty strange
behavior from you.
From me, strange?
- Well...
- How strange?
Very strange.
- Oh God! Shit.
- Yeah.
He bought a one-way ticket
to Barcelona.
And if I don't like it there
he's going to buy Bali for me.
Carol, you're imagining all this.
We're talking about Henry here,
sweetheart.
Your Henry! Henry couldn't possibly
steal five million...
- Henry, you son of a bitch.
- What am I going to do?
I'd take Bali.
What a moron!
He's calling the cops!
Cops? More cops?
He says he's taking your sister
to Newark Airport.
I need a drink.
I think I need one
and so does Carol.
- Carol doesn't drink.
- She does now.
Old Bushmill. A double!
I'd kind of like to know
what you were doing in that toilet?
Toilet?
- What?
- The toilet?
I had
a little intestinal cash... gas.
Hey, don't bullshit me.
No, Sir.
And now Mr. Nasty is gonna chop,
dice and mince me!
Yeah, right.
I'll be with you in a second,
Sergeant!
What's happened,
have you been arrested?
Don't say anything
without a lawyer.
My hair dresser Cynthia,
has a second cousin...
that body waxes Alan Dershowitz.
Should I call her?
- Henry, these are real?
- Carol! You shouldn't have told them!
I thought Vic could talk
some sense into you.
You were supposed to take
the present and blow them off.
- Charming.
- Nice.
And stop drinking, you're going
to make yourself sick. Give me that.
What did the Sergeant say?
He wasn't exactly satisfied
with my explanation.
I knew you should have turned
the money in.
You give it back, apologize.
Tell him you didn't realize
it was the wrong briefcase!
Take it easy! He doesn't know
anything about the money.
But you just said he wasn't satisfied
with your explanation.
About my behavior
in Barney's Tavern, that's what.
- What's he talking about?
- God only knows.
The cop was on a stakeout
at Barney's.
And he thought my behavior
was a little strange...
going in and out of the men's room,
back and forth then I confessed.
- Confessed to what?
- To soliciting.
Soliciting what?
Men.
I knew you were going
to do that.
Why would he think
you were soliciting men?
Well, he claims he saw me go into
the john four times in a half hour.
And each time I came out, he said
I looked more and more excited.
Apparently I was also breathing heavily,
and my hands were shaking...
and I was flowing at the mouth.
Anyway...
for ten thousand dollars
he won't say a thing.
You can't bribe a police officer!
Hey, I offered him five,
he wanted twenty...
we settled on ten.
Okay, tell the taxi driver
we'll be right down.
That taxi's going nowhere,
he's out of commission.
- Out of commission?
- Vic backed into him.
- That's not true, he backed into me.
- Now our bumpers are locked.
Well un-lock him, Vic!
I've got a plane to catch!
Take a look at him.
You see what money
does to people?
Come on, Gina, I don't have to
take this. Screw the "nouveau riche."
Can you believe my Henry?
He's only been here ten minutes...
and he's already admitted to soliciting,
bribed a police officer and bought Bali.
And you married him.
- You lucky dog.
- Come on.
Ten thousand.
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
Hey, hey, hey! You're gonna dent
my fender, man! Come on.
- Shut up, or I'll dent your head!
- You couldn't dent a head of lettuce.
You wanna piece of me?
Hey, you know I think
I stepped in a piece of you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Larry and Curly?
- Knock it off!
- What did I do?
Rum.
Hello!
- Brandy.
- Hello!
Amaretto.
Excuse me.
- Oh my!
- I'm sorry. Are you Mrs. Perkins?
- Why? You selling something?
- No, no.
Detective Slater.
N.Y.P.D.
- Homicide?
- That's right.
I'm afraid I have some rather
disturbing news for you, Ma'am.
We have reason to believe
Mr. Perkins, your husband...
well, he's dead.
Dead in what sense?
Well, two bullet holes through
the back of the head dead.
Bullets?
His body was dumped
in the East River.
- River?
- And his face is badly beaten.
Several ribs are broken.
We'll know more after the autopsy.
- So it wasn't an accident, then?
- No, no.
Maybe I should make you
a cup of coffee.
- Where's the kitchen?
- Over there.
No! No!
I don't drink!
I mean, I don't drink coffee.
So tell me. What makes you think
that this body is my Henry?
Although we found
no formal identification on him...
he still had his briefcase.
I'm so sorry.
This is your husband's briefcase,
isn't it?
It's been in the river.
The police divers
recovered these.
That's the tuna sandwich
I made Henry.
He just loves the way
I mince the onions.
I'm sorry.
A formal identification
is going to be required.
No, this's definitely
a tuna sandwich...
Of the body.
Are you sure you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
Heartbroken, but fine.
Okay, we can go in my car
if you like.
It's right across the Holland tunnel.
He's in the morgue there.
Should I wait here
while you go get your purse?
No, no. I'll rather
you wait down in your car.
Are you sure?
You look a little shaky.
Well, how would you feel
if your husband was just shot...
- and couldn't get to finish his lunch?
- Of course. Yeah, no.
Is there anybody else
in the house?
To look after you?
Yes.
There's my sister Leslie.
- Good. Sister?
- Yes, she's here.
She's here, and she's upstairs.
And she's with her husband.
And it's Leslie and Chris.
Would you believe?
One thousand short.
- Honey, say hello to...
- Slater...
- Hi, how are you?
- Detective Slater!
- Detective?
- N.Y.P.D.
He's brought some disturbing news that
I don't think that I'm quite sure...
how to handle it.
Why don't you sprawl out and relax
a little bit, sweet? You have a little...
No, I'm better standing.
It's easier to get to the drinks.
Okay, we go on three,
crapdriver!
- One, two...
- Asshole!
three!
The bumper!
Watch out.
No! No!
Damn!
What seems to be
the problem, Detective?
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Perkins.
- Are you a relative, Sir?
- Of whom?
- Of Henry A. Perkins.
- I...
Yes, he is.
Henry's brother.
- Henry's brother?
- Yes!
He's poor, poor
Henry's dear brother.
I'm afraid
I have a shock for you, Sir.
We have pretty much every reason to
believe that Mr. Henry Perkins is dead.
- Yep, that's a shock, alright?
- He's been murder.
We fished his body
out of the East River.
- Kick the bucket.
- Two bullet on his head.
- Pushing up the old daisies.
- I get it, Carol. He's dead.
All he had with him
was his briefcase.
- This is your brother's?
- Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God! Oh God!
Since Mrs. Perkins
is the next of kin...
we need her to make
a positive identification of the body.
Mr. Nasty...
Nasty.
It's a nasty, nasty thing.
Henry!
You can't call him back, Carol!
If Henry has gone to Heaven
he's gone to Heaven.
You'll have to rely on me now.
His little brother...
- Freddy!
- Gilbert!
She's in shock.
Take a look at that strange guy
in front of Carol and Henry's.
What? You don't think
that's Mr. Nasty?
Actually,
it's Freddy Gilbert Perkins.
You'll have to excuse my wife.
Yes, my wife...
You'll have to excuse my wife.
I don't know where the heck
she could be.
I'm know she'd want to be here
to comfort Carol...
Bernice...
Bernice's my wife, of course.
She must be resting up
before we...
- take off for Sydney.
- Australia?
- You're a long way from home.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.
We had quite a nice walkabout
here in the States.
And it's time now...
it's our lambing season.
We have some sharing to do,
and hunt down a few of those crocks...
and turn them out
into a few shrimps on the barbie...
We've got to tell Leslie and Chris
as well, Freddy.
Oh yeah.
That's going to put a damper
on the family reunion...
How about I make some coffee
while you stay on the den?
- But, Henry, my...
- My brother loved the den. It's...
On second thought,
he was very fond of the...
curb outside,
in front of the house.
Extraordinary. He likes staying
out there. He can ruminate for hours.
- Why don't you wait outside?
- I'd rather wait up here.
I'm waiting.
- One thousand.
- Yeah, okay.
That's my other brother.
- Other brother?
- Yes, that's Archie.
We were in the middle of the game
of draughts. Draughts...
- You know, darts.
- Henry!
- It's no use calling him!
- Yeah, but, Henry...
She just can't accept that he's gone.
It's me, Freddy, Henry's brother.
Yeah, well...
what are we going to do?
We're going to pray.
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...
Oh God almighty...
Detective, you seem like a man
who enjoys fine art.
Do you like Mapplethorpe?
Excuse me.
Hello. What?
What are all the nude guys
doing out?
Listen to what
I'm trying to tell you.
I went to
the Soho Art Gallery today...
and "the" Madame Virginia...
loved "me."
My work, I mean.
She even told me
to call her "V".
Carol...
this is fantastic.
I know!
If Henry Perkins is dead,
nobody's coming after him.
- Henry, you were not listening to me.
- It had to be Mr. Nasty who got shot.
So he's not coming after us.
What's that?
- Give it to me.
- Hello?
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're saying.
- Who is it?
- I don't know he sounds foreign.
What?
He keeps saying "brerfcurse".
"Brerfcurse"?
"Brerfcurse, brerfcurse".
"Brerfcurse, brerfcurse".
Case. Case.
Give me that.
I'm sorry, the briefcase's moved
to Thailand. Good day.
Brerfcurse, brerfcurse!
- That was probably Mr. Big.
- Who's Mr. Big?
- The guy who shot Mr. Nasty.
- Why's he calling us?
Because we have Mr. Nasty's briefcase
with Mr. Big's money in it!
Henry!
- You'll never guess what we just did.
- Never mind, Vic.
- We have to get out of here right away.
- We can't go now!
- She's right... Mr. Nasty...
- Carol, you're bombed.
You're not making any sense.
I know what's best.
Oh yeah, Mr. Know-it-all.
Then you tell me
how we're gonna make a break for it...
with NYPD Blue
waiting in the den?
- N.Y.P.D. who?
- Never mind, Vic.
But Gina's outside with the body.
Yes, who's going to identify
the dead body?
- Dead body? No, no...
- Vic, please! Please!
- Say hello to my little friend.
- I think your briefcase is ringing.
- Don't answer it.
- It's him again.
- Who?
- Mr. Nasty.
No, it can't be
Mr. Nasty, he's...
You're right, you're right,
it's Mr. Big!
- Do I know Mr. Big?
- He's Mr. Brerfcurse.
- Mr. who?
- He's the guy who killed Mr. Nasty.
- He's foreign.
- Who is?
Mr. Brerfcurse.
He's Mr. Big.
How did he get
your phone number?
It's not our phone,
it's Mr. Nasty's phone.
- I'm scared.
- Why?
Because, I think I'm starting
to understand you.
Say hello to my little friend.
Hey!
Come on, guys.
- Vic, didn't you tell them about...
- Say hello to...
- Perkins Residence.
- Gina! No!
- That wasn't very nice.
- You don't have to be nice to Nasty!
- I thought Mr. Nasty was dead?
- He couldn't be, he's...
- He is! I meant Mr. Big!
- Who's Mr. Big?
Here we go again...
Perkins.
Perkins.
Audio timeline: 8:31 p.m.
Arrived thirteen minutes ago.
I notified the widow
of her husband's demise...
I offered coffee
and a sympathetic shoulder.
Widow opted for Bushmill.
It's now 8:33 p.m.
Still waiting for in-laws
to depart.
My police instinct tells me
something is amiss...
I feel...
a danger lurking.
If Mr. Nasty is dead, then
who's the guy in the front porch?
Oh my God!
Mr. Feldman!
Hello, Captain?
Yes, Sir.
Well, I am still here.
I know that, Captain.
Yes, I understand.
I...
I know you're hungry,
I'm simply...
Okay, let me just grab...
Yeah, Vindaloo, Chippatti...
Poppadom, Bhajee...
A little slower, Captain. This is
actually my first Indian take-out order.
So bear with me.
How do you spell Vindaloo?
Capitan? Hello?
You idiot.
Sorry about that,
a little technical...
How do you spell Vindaloo,
Captain?
Captain? Captain?
He's soaking wet.
What did you do to him?
Vic hit him
with your birthday present.
- You didn't!
- Yeah, '89 Obrion.
- You didn't!
- I did.
Really?
It's a fabulous year.
- Would somebody tell me who this guy is?
- He's Henry's boss.
- Welcome to our home, Mr. Feldman!
- I thought he was Mr. Nasty.
He pulled a knife on me.
Cigar clippers?
What? Did you think
he was gonna give you a pedicure?
I haven't forgotten about you.
Coffee'll be a sec.
No.
Don't worry, he's alive.
Grandpa's got a boner the size
of the Chrysler Building!
That's because
he's been using the stiff stuff.
I've been talking to Vic
about using these.
- Gina!
- What'd I say?
It's not like he has
a major problem, or anything.
Sometimes...
and only sometimes
I lose my concentration...
it's no trouble rising
to the occasion...
it's just that I tend to leave
the party early.
- It's too much info, Vic.
- It is. It is.
Carol, what's Mr. Feldman
doing here anyway?
I invited him
for your birthday dinner.
Henry, this is an omen. This is God
telling you to give the money back.
I'll deal with God
when we get to Barcelona.
Oh God!
- We're dead.
- How did he get our phone number?
Because Miss Howard Stern
gave him our last name.
Birthday boy, that's it.
Gina, we're out of here!
Can't we wait until intermission?
Your phone's ringing.
Phone ringing?
I don't hear a phone ringing?
It must be the telly upstairs.
Maybe your ears are plugged.
Please. Give us a minute.
We're grieving.
- This is a painful time for us.
- Very painful.
Pulsingly.
Hey, Perkins!
Alright, what are you doing?
Time is money, you know.
I'm out of one here
and waiting on the other. "Capice"?
Hello?
Yeah, just a minute.
Hi, mom, how's the laryngitis.
Yeah, okay,
I love you too. Bye.
Hey, snap it up.
You didn't forget about the rest
of your charitable contribution...
to my policemen fund, did you?
I mean, it's tax deductible.
Are any of you crazy ass white
going to Newark Airport tonight?
Because my meter's running like
a crack head mama's VCR.
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Brown.
My in-laws.
- No, you mean the outlaws.
- No!
I know what I mean,
you know what I mean?
Why don't you wait outside?
I ain't hanging around here
all damn night.
I'm giving you five minutes,
you got that?
One, two, three, four, five and "adiós".
I'm out of here, you got that?
And I better get a fat ass tip,
you know what I mean?
They'll be less than that.
Here, here.
Take the Brown's bag, okay?
What, just one suitcase?
Traveling all the way from Australia?
Yes.
What are they, nudists?
Yes.
Crazy ass nudists.
He's got a point there. Two people,
round the world trip with one suitcase?
- Hey, are they nudists?
- Only when they take their clothes off.
I'm just thinking maybe you and your
wife are the ones who's go on a trip.
- No, no, no.
- Where are they then, these in-laws?
- Chris and Leslie?
- Yeah.
Leslie's outside, isn't he, Henry?
That's correct.
And I'm Chris.
Yes, this is Chris.
My wife's sister, from Sydney.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
My sister is from Sydney?
This gotta stop!
Enough!
Enough!
This gotta stop!
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go.
Leslie! Oh my God, good day.
- Good day?
- Yes, good day. Yes.
I was just talking with the dingo here
from the kitchen...
- Oh, the kitchen!
- Yes, the kitchen.
About the ten thousand.
Yes, yes.
I believe we're even.
Well, be careful
crossing the street, Sergeant.
We wouldn't want anyone
running you over like a dog...
and leave you squirming
and writhing in the street.
Thanks for your concern, Perkins.
It touches me.
But if I thought I was in
any danger at all out here...
I mean I'd just blast that car and...
bang-bang.
Yeah, I shoot the insides
out of a cannoli.
Anyway...
this has been rewarding.
I can't wait to come back
for a visit.
Now you'll be safe.
I look forward to see you.
Thank God, he's gone!
Now I feel like a drink.
I feel like a cigarette.
Maybe I should go out
and come back in again?
Shut up, Vic,
and help me move him.
Alright, grab his feet.
Let's get him up.
Mr. Perkins?
Excuse me.
Detective? Are you through
with licking the statues' ass?
Yes.
No, that...
The body's waiting at the morgue.
We really must be going...
I know, I know the feeling.
Listen, we ought to get you
washed up first.
You know I'd love if you'd make
the coffee. It's in the cupboard.
I like mine black.
This is weird, watching you take off
another man's pants.
- I'm in the medical profession.
- You're a dental hygienist.
What the hell are you two doing?
This suit is drenched.
Do you want him to catch pneumonia?
Well, show the man some dignity.
He's naked for God's sakes.
Holly salami.
We're never gonna make
that flight.
Vic, cover him up.
These babies really last.
Hello?
Yes, this is Henry Perkins.
I made a reservation earlier tonight
for two to Barcelona at 10:15.
What's the next flight out?
Very good.
Can you get to Greece from there?
Excellent, 11:07.
Thank you.
Greece?
- How romantic.
- Don't tell her, Gina. It's a surprise.
What now?
Carol!
Jesus!
What's up, Angel?
My blood pressure?
I'm still waiting on this wacky couple
to go to Newark Airport.
There's a broke down limo eight blocks
from you. You want the fare?
Screw that naked fools.
Mr. Perkins, coffee's ready!
For Christ sake!
Do you mind?
I'm taking a bath.
Mrs. Perkins?
"Greece, 11:07."
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?
- It's better than going to jail.
- We're not going to jail.
Betty Ford maybe, but not jail.
- Leave me alone!
- Carol, stop it!
I need privacy.
Everybody out!
Hey, Perkins?
Audio timeline: 8:55 p.m.
A major clue discovered.
8:55, 17 seconds,
a second major clue.
Three! Three!
That's three major clues...
in roughly under 44 seconds!
- Do me a favor, will you, Leslie?
- Call me Vic.
Vic!
Give this to that neurotic cabby.
Will you see do he stays here.
Perkins?
What are you two hiding
under the blanket?
We weren't expecting you back,
Sergeant.
- Right, Leslie?
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Is that why you look so guilty?
- Guilty? We're just sitting here.
We're relaxing.
Kicking the heck, you know.
What a night!
I was outside "noodleing".
My guts brought me here.
I don't buy a story anymore.
Why not? I thought
it was a good one.
I mean, first, you brag about
getting lucky on your birthday...
bumping skin with the old lady.
And then fast as you can squeeze out
a fart, you confessed me you're a fag.
There's a very, very, very good
explanation for that.
- You've got my attention.
- Yeah, mine too.
- Carol, my wife...
- Yeah?
This is the real "me!"
Thanks to Doctor Rodgers...
not you!
Carol!
- She's a man!
- A man?
Keep it down, Leslie,
you know how sensitive he is?
Transsexual, actually.
A very prominent Beverly Hills doctor
had the operation a couple years ago.
Cost us a fortune.
That doc sure did a helluva job.
A hell of a job.
You don't think I can tell
the difference...
between a scungili
and a calamari?
So, what can we do for you,
Sergeant?
Nothing, your cabby split. He left
your suitcase right in the street.
- How thoughtful of you.
- I wouldn't want anybody to reap it off.
- That guy scares me.
- He scares me too.
- Hey, give me the keys to your car.
- What for?
To get to the airport.
You heard, the cab is gone.
- You can't take my car.
- I'll give you five thousand.
- Ten.
- Seven and five.
- Done.
- Done.
9:04 p.m. I have assemble
the victim's entire...
I suspect that the victim was a male,
roughly 5'11", maybe 5'12".
5'11", 188 pounds, I think.
By the look of it I would say
there's definitely a...
naked and dead body
somewhere in this house.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.
Cinderella,
your coach has arrived.
Is it true what they say
about you red hairs?
Is it true what they say
about cabbies?
Hell, yeah!
What they say?
Okay, here's your seven and five
hundred, Mr. Best Friend.
Thank you.
Mr. Perkins, something smells rotten
and I don't like it.
It wasn't me.
You must be
Mrs. Perkins' brother-in-law.
- Brother?
- Brother.
Mr. Perkins, did you know there's
a naked dead man in your house?
No, no, it was an accident.
I was totally self-defense.
- Where is he?
- Well, I don't know yet.
I've only found his clothes.
So you don't really know
that he's dead?
- You only know that he's naked.
- I'll tell you what I do know.
These clothes contain
blood splatters...
which could only come from
a gunshot wound...
caused by a Ruger Super Red Hawk .44
Magnum with a Hologram Scope.
Or a bottle of Château Obrion.
Likely story.
I got a big nose.
Robust.
- It's the '89?
- Excellent!
Hey, somebody's got to make
a liquor run.
- Well, she's in for the night.
- Carol?
Detective, I'd like you to meet
my sister-in-law.
Leslie, let's go downstairs
and have a cup of coffee.
What did the fish say
when he's hanging in the wall.
- What?
- Damn!
Why Snoop Dogg carry
an umbrella?
- Why don't you tell me?
- For drizzle.
That's so not funny.
We have to hide the briefcase
before Slater sees it.
Mr. Perkins?
Mr. Perkins?
Mr. Perkins?
Henry, the oven!
Detective?
Where did you go?
Mr. Perkins?
Who's going to identify the body?
What body, Henry?
I told you not to use
that name, Leslie.
- What name, Henry?
- That name, Leslie.
I might just break down
and weep like a baby.
- He does know, doesn't he?
- Yes, he knows! I've told him!
- Told me what?
- That Henry Perkins is dead.
Dead?
How do you mean, dead?
- I thought you just said you told him?
- I did tell him, I just got so far as...
tell him that Henry
wasn't looking too well.
His body was found with
two bullet holes in the East River.
I guess that would explain
why he wasn't looking too well.
I was trying to break it
to him gently.
He was identified
by his briefcase.
Oh yeah! His "brerfcurse".
That's why Carol's so upset...
poor, dear Carol.
It's good thing
her brother-in-law was here.
- Yes.
- I thought I was her brother-in-law.
You are! We both are,
just from different sides of the family.
That's something else I know,
isn't it?
Now do you see why I had
to break it to him slowly?
He hasn't been the same
since he fell off that kangaroo.
Henry had two brothers-in-law...
you, Leslie...
and me, Freddy.
Because Henry's dead. Yes!
Tragic.
Yes.
Now everybody in the family
knows Henry's dead.
Dead, dead, dead.
Chris and Leslie.
And Carol.
And my wife Bernice.
And me, reliable Freddy.
- What about Archie?
- Who's Archie?
I don't remember who Archie is.
This is it.
Here? Come on,
you don't want to go in there.
Trust me, it's easier to stay out
than to get out.
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Hey, doll.
Do you believe in love
at first sight...
or do I have to walk by again?
Keep walking.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Mrs. Perkins?
It's...
Madame Virginia.
Mrs. Perkins?
Yummy.
- Is Archie still here?
- No, Archie had to leave.
You guys saw
that good looking broad come in here?
He's back!
- What?
- He is?
- Nice to see you again, Archie.
- What are you talking about?
I said it's good
to see you again, Archie.
I don't think you've officially met
my brother Archie...
Detective Slater?
- Please.
- Are you a cop?
N.Y.P.D.
This is my big brother,
Archie Perkins.
Yes, Archie Perkins,
damn glad to meet you!
I hate him!
I wish he'd fall
into a vat of hot wax...
and get molded
into a giant corn on the cob!
What happened to my Henry?
The Henry I fell in love with?
The Henry that used to paint
my toe nails?
You know, Carol, if my husband brought
home a briefcase full of money...
- I'd be out the door in a flash.
- Well, It's not about the money.
Tonight was going to be
my night.
I was finally
going to be discovered.
Honey, don't you think
you're a little bit over dressed?
Who are you?
Where am I?
Is this a fantasy?
It must have cost me a fortune.
Is this a dream?
No, I'm real.
N.Y.P.D. is a little out of your
jurisdiction, isn't it?
I'm waiting for Mrs. Perkins
to accompany me to the morgue...
to identify the body.
- There's a body now?
- Doesn't he know, Freddy?
Freddy, is it?
The sad thing about it, Archie,
is that Henry's dead.
No!
Freddy!
You know, last time I saw him
I thought he looked a bit pale.
He was shot in the head
and drowned in the river, Archie.
He always had
suicidal tendencies.
We suspect murder.
Murder?
Leslie, why don't you take
brother Archie up on the roof...
and discuss what kind of cash he may
be gaining from Henry's will, poor Henry.
Freddy, I don't think
the roof's a good idea.
- Yeah, I think it's a very good idea.
- Freddy!
- You can fill in the blank spots for me.
- Don't worry.
There are too many blanks.
- Well, now, how about that...
- Don't say coffee.
I want Mrs. Perkins now!
Well, now, Detective...
I realize she's an available woman, but
don't you think it's a little soon...
after her husband's demise
to be thinking that sort of thing?
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I'll just pretend I never heard it...
Mr. Perkins?
Surprise!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy
Damn safety cap.
- Henry, where are you going?
- Come back in here.
Why're those people singing
"happy birthday Henry" to you?
There's a very good reason.
Yes?
Henry and I are twins.
Identical.
Identical twins.
My, my, my, this is getting
more complicated by the minute.
And you call yourself
a detective...
Maybe this case is just a little too big
for the N.Y.P.D.?
I tell you what,
while I go out there...
and explain to those people
about poor Henry.
I'm sorry.
You stay here and you make that coffee.
It's in the cupboard.
Twins.
And?
And he has two first class tickets
to Greece!
And?
That's all I know.
It was Michelangelo.
No, it was Da Vinci
who said that...
"Man is in the wrong
to be ashamed to exhibit it...
he ought to adorn
and display it."
Let's face it.
Women everywhere dream of going with
an Italian named Marcello to Venice.
You ever hear of a chick wanting to go
with a Jew named Murray to Tel Aviv?
Well, unless he's charming,
good-looking, smart, funny...
- sexy...
- Did I mention I was rich?
So am I.
- Happy birthday, Henry.
- Thanks, Steve, thanks for coming.
Everybody?
Everybody...
I just want to say
"thank you very much".
You really did surprise me.
Thank you.
My friend Henry Perkins.
A regular guy if ever I knew one.
Henry's as regular as Exlax!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that
Henry Perkins doesn't exist anymore.
In fact, Henry Perkins is dead.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Doesn't anybody like the guy?
- I don't know.
I said cream and sugar, didn't I?
Come on. There's a party going on here.
Open this door, Carol.
Oh my God, Carol!
What have you done?
Wake up!
Wake up, Carol!
- Please, wake up!
- Gina!
Tonight's party is a theme party.
I'm sure Carol
told everything to you...
when she set
this incredible thing up.
I don't know where she is.
She's probably upstairs doing her nails.
She should be down by breakfast.
Come on, honey, open wide.
Anyway, anyway.
It's a murder mystery.
Henry's been shot
in the head twice.
Nobody knows who's done it.
It could be anybody here.
We hired two actors
to play police detectives.
So that'll make it
a little more interesting.
And remember, I'm...
Henry's evil twin...
Freddy!
The blue represents all the dark
midnights of a starving New York artist.
- Its simplicity is it's genius!
- Yes.
Just like my wax blueberries.
You know, it's great
that we're both in the arts.
Yours hangs on museum walls...
and mine sits on kitchen tables.
Mr. Feldman?
- Stan Martin.
- Who are you?
I work for you.
- Bruised bananas.
- Oh yeah, Martin, the wiz kid.
Why don't you whiz on
over to the bar...
and grab us a couple of glasses
of chardonnay?
Sure.
What happened?
So far my pleading ignorance
has cost you a hundred grand.
- A hundred grand?
- Well, first he wanted fifty...
for not spilling the beans about Henry,
Leslie, Freddy and Archie.
What about the other fifty?
For not spilling the beans
about Carol being a man.
- What?
- That's what happens...
when you leave the room
for five minutes.
Where's Captain corruptness now?
Up on the roof singing,
"If I was a rich man".
Vic?
I just want you to know that your wife
not only broke our bathroom door...
but she assaulted my person.
Carol, you can't go to the airport
dressed like that?
That's because I'm not going.
I'm not going to spend the rest
of my life "on the lamb."
For God's sakes, Carol, just go!
Henry needs looking after.
- Yeah, he can find someone else.
- Don't think I couldn't.
I can think of a thousand women
who would jump at the chance.
- Yeah? Name one!
- Gina Johnson.
You what?
That is, if you don't mind and,
you know...
Henry would take me.
Is there something wrong
with my hearing?
Very well. I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have party guests to attend to.
Get a grip of yourself.
Thank you.
Carol always did know
how to make an entrance.
Hi, Bill.
Thanks.
Mary Ann, great to see you.
Joe, it's the best score
I ever made.
And I didn't have
to whack anybody either.
Come on, we're late.
Everybody let's kick up!
Mr. Perkins?
Mr. Perkins, I have had it!
- Where did you go, detective?
- No, no, no.
That's enough of that.
I've had with that.
Okay.
Who's booked
on a 11:07 flight to Greece?
Let me see that.
That's isn't a reservation
for an airline.
That's a reservation
for a Broadway show...
on November the seventh.
- Broadway show?
- Yeah, some revival of Grease.
You know.
We go together like shama lama lama
Da dingity dingy dop
This was my birthday present
to Henry.
Don't.
There's two hundred and fifty
down the drain, huh, Leslie?
Excuse me,
do you have a cork screw?
- Mr. Perkins?
- Don't answer that.
Yeah, forty Sinatra Drive.
- Who was it?
- Mr. Brerfcurse is on his way.
Brerfcurse?
You smell lamb?
- Fire! Fire!
- Oh my God! Fire!
- Fire! Fire!
- Take it out.
- Take water. Water, water!
- Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Tampering with evidence
is a felony.
Punishable by up to ten years
in prison.
No, no, no, this is just my briefcase.
It's just my briefcase.
It's just like yours. They just
look alike. That's all. Show to him.
- See, it's here.
- Same kind.
Great minds think alike,
detective.
I'd like that piece of paper back.
The piece of paper?
Yes, indeed. It was right...
Here we are.
Mr. Perkins,
as an officer of the law...
I'm ordering you to come with me
to identify your brother's body!
What, are you insane?
I can't identify Henry's body.
He was my twin.
It would be like...
like looking at myself...
dead on the slab.
I just need some member of the family
to come with me.
- Not me!
- You will be well paid, Leslie.
It's not unusual for one of the members
of the bereaved family...
- to volunteer for the job.
- I never volunteer on principle.
You'll be well, well paid, Leslie.
No, there's no payment
involved in this.
You know what I mean,
for transportation.
Transportation?
He has to go across the river.
Yes, across the river and back.
Do you know how much the tolls are?
Look, why don't you just let the family
take care of this?
- You finish making the coffee...
- I've made the coffee.
- I've made the coffee twice.
- Sure it's cold by now.
Cold as ice.
Better make a new pot!
- Okay, Leslie.
- No.
- I'm not going.
- Leslie, let me handle this.
I'm not going, Freddy.
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
You don't know broke. I'm so broke
I got groceries only one way.
Don't worry,
they're making more.
- I'm going down to that morgue, Henry!
- Vic, I'm begging you. Please.
- Not in a million years.
- There's cash, of course.
- It's not a question of... how much?
- Ten thousand.
- Thirty.
- Twenty.
- Twenty-five.
- Done.
It's amazing how fast it goes.
So are you surprised
someone bumped Henry off?
No, man, not if all the stories
about Carol...
doing Henry's twin brother,
Freddy, are true.
You know something
is going on there.
Hi, fellows.
Slater, Homicide.
I'm investigating
the whole Perkins murder.
Sure, sure.
You were saying that Mrs. Perkins
wasn't faithful?
That woman was born
with her legs apart.
When she dies, they'll going to put her
in a Y shaped coffin.
- Well, did Mr. Perkins have any enemies?
- Everybody hated Henry and his brother.
Women, children...
Everybody hated Henry Perkins.
Hey, hey, off the record,
Henry and his twin brother Freddy...
were selling drugs,
soliciting women...
the wax fruit factory is actually
their cover for a white slavery ring.
- Stan, come dance with me.
- Hey! I'll talk to you later.
I'm on the road tonight.
Hey, welcome, welcome,
welcome to the show.
Hey, pops, I think it's bedtime.
What do you call a woman
who's paralyzed from the waist down?
Married!
Thanks.
Carol? Carol?
We gotta skedaddle.
Mr. Big's on his way here.
You'll never understand
the needs of an artist.
There are no art critics coming tonight!
I hate to be the one to tell you that.
But I do have a surprise for you,
that will make up for tonight...
and for all the promises
I've never kept.
Because I love you
so much, Carol.
Come on, guys!
- Don't let anybody in.
- Yeah, I'm...
Look at this piece of crap
somebody gave me.
- That's our present.
- Well, it's the thought that counts.
Here it is.
- Put them in.
- I'd take my 25 g's now, Henry.
I'm surprised at you, Vic. You don't
take money for helping a friend.
Yes, I do.
And besides, we're not friends,
we're family.
Out again, boys.
You know, it's a crime. It's a crime.
You don't let me in.
Give my hundred grand.
Come on, now!
- It's a bargain.
- Yeah, it is a bargain.
- Here we go.
- Give me the rest.
- Don't forget my money, Henry.
- You're squeezing him too?
No, I'm getting paid
for services rendered.
Mr. Perkins?
I can't seem to find the...
Oh my goodness!
I guess he's caught the three of us
at it now, huh?
This is not what it looks like.
Leslie's decided
to accompany you to the morgue.
Good. Let's go, Leslie.
Yeah, I just need five minutes
to get ready.
- Another five minutes?
- He's got his hands full at the moment.
Fine. I'll wait for you
down in the car.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Don't be like that.
I was just having a little fun.
Hey, fellows, serious...
stay close.
What is a husband's idea
of foreplay?
A better power of begging.
Henry, I hate to bring this up,
but I'm a little five g's short.
Alright.
What the hell is this?
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.
I got it.
- Where's the money?
- Search me?
- That's not a bad idea, Vic.
- Hey!
You can insult my cheese wheel.
You can even steal my wife.
But I draw the line
at being called a crook!
Alright, I'm sorry about
your cheese wheel...
but I mean, seriously, where could
it be? I put it right down in here.
He comes in there and...
He comes in...
- Slater.
- Slater.
Then who's briefcase is this?
Kinky.
And it's a front
for a white slavery ring.
Captain, I know you're starving...
but my instincts tell me
the murderer is here!
Move it.
Yes!
Thank you.
I know who you are.
You're the cliché European bad guys
who shot him in the head...
and dumped him in the river.
No, too obvious,
good try though, huh?
Yeah, baby, get down.
Shake it. Yeah.
The blue has such a sensual feel.
There he is.
Okay, I'll distract him
while you'll switch cases.
Mr. Perkins, where's Leslie?
- He'll be down in about five minutes.
- Five minutes?
That's all I've been hearing all night.
If he's not down very, very soon...
I'm going to be forced
to make an arrest.
Who are you gonna arrest?
Well, when I do it's going to be
evident who that person is.
I'm sorry.
Did I do that?
- Where's Leslie?
- He'll be down in five minutes.
Five minutes.
Hey, man, you spill my drink.
It's the briefcase?
Excuse me.
Mr. Big.
What the hell is the difference?
Put it in the back seat.
- Mr. Feldman?
- Henry, hey!
I'm so glad you're alive.
I won't be coming back to work.
I'm retiring early.
- Henry, wait!
- Don't try and change my mind!
This is not about you
and wax fruit.
- It's about my wife.
- I really need you.
Carol needs me more.
And you know what I realized tonight?
- I need her.
- And I need some pants.
Mr. Perkins!
Your wife Carol...
what a talent!
I'd very much like to give her
a show at my gallery.
- Really?
- Yes.
And I think
this might belong to you.
I have one just like it.
I must have picked yours by mistake.
Sol, I have the feeling
you won't be needing those pants.
Happy birthday, Henry.
We are out of here.
Come on, baby.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Feldman's Wax Fruit presents...
Tom Jones!
Come on!
- Hey, have you seen Henry Perkins?
- Haven't you heard? Henry's dead.
- Hi, Vic, how are you?
- Hey.
Henry? I got it!
Henry, this is the briefcase
with the money.
- Vic, Henry, they're here!
- Where?
Mr. Perkins!
It's being over five minutes.
"Brerfcurse"!
- What?
- What?
Awesome, it's like seeing
some Tarantino movie.
Happy birthday to
Brerfcurse!
Looks like we'll all be going
to the morgue.
Make a wish, honey.
Drop it!
They're real bullets, everybody.
Run!
What the hell is going on?
- Great party, Henry.
- Thanks.
He's got a gun.
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!
I'm a cop!
I'm a cop!
Let's go!
- Run!
- Hurry!
Henry, I changed my mind.
I want to go to Barcelona.
It's not Barcelona, it's Greece.
Greece?
I always wanted to go to Greece.
It's my dream.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Let's get down
through the back stairs. Come on!
My fish!
I need backup. Send help.
Send the Swat team, send anybody.
We're live at Hoboken, New Jersey,
where a violent shooting...
has left three men dead.
Vasile Zolton, suspected Romanian
crime syndicated boss...
was one of the three men
found dead...
in the apartment
of Henry and Carol Perkins.
Detective Dennis Slater
is the officer who crack the case.
Detective Slater,
how did you do it?
I cannot comment
on the particulars of this case.
Are you watching
what I'm watching?
On a personal note
white slavery is wrong...
sex toys should be
for adults only...
and drugs kill as is evidenced
by this ghastly occurrence.
Hey, listen, I spoke to the broke.
He said we give him cash.
What the hell is this?
Perkins!
Perkins!
Henry, you're the man.
I told you, Vic.
Yeah, but, Carol, I'm sorry you missed
your flight to Greece.
Who needs Greece
when we're on Paradise?
- Hey, can I see it, honey?
- Yeah, come on.
"Voilà".
Carol!
Lower your hand, honey.
Come on, baby.
