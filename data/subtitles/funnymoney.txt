1
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,519
Moron!

2
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,220
What are these?

3
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,170
Stop the presses!

4
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:54,216
Stop the presses!

5
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,982
Martin! Stan Martin!
Where are you?

6
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,872
- Yes, Sir, Mr. Perkins.
- What's this?

7
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:02,919
A banana.

8
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,638
I know it's a banana,
what's this?

9
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:08,527
- Those would be bruises, Sir.
- Bruises?

10
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,383
Yeah, I thought it might appear
more realistic...

11
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,293
if the fruit had bruises on them.

12
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:15,244
Come here, Stan.

13
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,127
Alright, where is it?

14
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,743
- Alright, what's this?
- That's my bruised banana.

15
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:28,645
No!
That's my bruised banana.

16
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:33,354
I came up with the whole concept
back in 1997.

17
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,457
You see, the whole idea was to alternate
your fruit incrementally...

18
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:42,125
from fresh, to right, to rotten.

19
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,933
Giving the customer
the total wax fruit experience.

20
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:46,981
Wow!

21
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:48,779
That's brilliant.

22
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,935
Thanks.

23
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,552
- Why didn't you go ahead with it?
- Feldman shot it down.

24
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,663
He said, "You know,
in forty five years...

25
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:59,242
we never had a Feldman banana
with a bruise on it."

26
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,228
So if it ain't broke...

27
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:02,278
Henry!

28
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,972
- Now?
- Right now.

29
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,185
- Okay. Alright.
- You're already late.

30
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,946
Alright, I'm going.

31
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:17,520
Trust is the key
to every great relationship.

32
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:18,665
Even the tragic ones.

33
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,579
There was "trust"
when Eve gave Adam that apple.

34
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,262
When Delilah cut Samson's hair.

35
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:27,248
There was even "trust" when Ross
screwed around on Rachel...

36
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,190
when he thought they were
on "a break".

37
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:32,878
But what these couples
didn't do is...

38
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,983
- "communicate".
- You're late.

39
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:36,816
We had a rush order
on kumquats.

40
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,565
I tried that, alright, but it just
blows up in my face, you know.

41
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:42,446
And she's all mad because
I'm checking out some websites.

42
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:45,445
- What kind of websites?
- Smokinghotchicks.com.

43
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,222
- My God.
- Let's put a pin in here.

44
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,238
Welcome, Henry.

45
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,063
Now, in our last session...

46
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:57,708
Carol was concern that Henry is
"a creature of habit."

47
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:58,928
- Yes.
- Look, Mr. Rogers...

48
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,546
- Doctor Rogers.
- Whatever.

49
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,558
Can we go on to someone else
first, please?

50
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,672
You see, Henry's hidden self
is his true self...

51
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:08,293
which is true
for all of ourselves.

52
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:12,272
But we see his false self,
which manifests itself...

53
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:15,981
in his ritualistic,
routine, compulsive behavior.

54
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,160
Yes, that's true.

55
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,113
Henry never takes any chances.

56
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,999
There's no spontaneity
in our lives.

57
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:24,847
- No "joi du vivre."
- Jua-da-what?

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,695
Let's see.

59
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,385
It's Bumble Bee Tuna
everyday for lunch.

60
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,342
6:30, Miller Lite time.

61
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,262
8:00, Nick at Nite for dinner.

62
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:36,207
And the best of Tom Jones CD
before bed.

63
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,256
- Tom Jones?
- It's like living with Rain Man.

64
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,045
Yeah, I know what you mean.

65
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,085
- Well, today's his birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

66
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,883
And you know what he wants?

67
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:48,589
The exact same
brown lamb's skin briefcase.

68
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:54,407
I don't know, perhaps you rather discuss
Carol's collection of phallics?

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,422
Phallics?

70
00:05:56,528 --> 00:06:00,143
They're not phallics,
they're nudes!

71
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:02,150
Whatever you call them,
they're just a bunch of shlongs!

72
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,045
Do you use live models?

73
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,831
Carol's been painting and sculpturing
naked people forever...

74
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:07,887
but she never shows them
to anybody.

75
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:11,749
Well, someone please tell him
that takes years to be discovered!

76
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,474
Because if you ever need
a volunteer...

77
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,588
What?

78
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,440
She's a fine artist.

79
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:20,388
Thank you.

80
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,383
Lord knows, I mean,
every Friday...

81
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,253
she drags her portfolio down
to the art galleries...

82
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,877
but never steps inside.

83
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,798
I have problems...

84
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,912
dealing with rejection.

85
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:34,734
Please, don't cry.

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,589
She cries at the drop of a hat.

87
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,703
Obviously,
Carol's hidden self...

88
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:43,438
is afraid to express her personal,
exhibitionist wishes.

89
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,280
You see, everything we do
is a window into our subconscious.

90
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,000
Now pay attention,
because there will come a time...

91
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,040
where you will be able
to look into that window...

92
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,960
and see who you are and why...

93
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:59,631
and in that
"transformative moment"...

94
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:01,541
your life will become clear.

95
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:05,423
I want you all to read my new book.
It's only US$29,95...

96
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,212
and it's signed.

97
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,950
"The Transformative Moment".
It'll swag the bookstores.

98
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,912
Henry, hey!
Hi, birthday boy.

99
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:20,877
<i>Hey, Vic.</i>

100
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,495
Carol says I'm too predictable,
which is a croak...

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,415
<i>but since you know me</i>
longer than anybody...

102
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,549
- I value your opinion the most.
- <i>Okay.</i>

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,247
Quit tapping the pencil,
okay, Ringo.

104
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,136
And then wipe the white powder
off your lips...

105
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,150
<i>from your daily doughnut fix...</i>

106
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:36,263
before someone thinks
you've been blowing a kabuki.

107
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,909
- I knew I could count on you, Vic.
- Hey, waiter, where's my espresso?

108
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:41,871
Hey, Henry, I gotta go.
Good you call.

109
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:42,820
See you tonight!

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,647
Thank you. Your check.

111
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,431
Okay, that's 1200.

112
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,616
- What?
- Guavas.

113
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,598
- The good ones.
- Coming through.

114
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,104
Mr. Feldman?

115
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,911
And I want those reports on my desk
in 24 hours! You got that?

116
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,896
- Now run along!
- Right away, Sir.

117
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,016
- Henry!
- Yes.

118
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,925
- I want to talk to you!
- Yes, Sir.

119
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,476
Are you responsible
for the bruises on these bananas?

120
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,649
No, Sir.
That's Martin's...

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,273
Stan Martin. Yes.

122
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,191
- In fact, I was just going to...
- Well, commend that son of a bitch.

123
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:21,126
The best god damn idea
I've seen in twenty two years.

124
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,085
- Now you like it?
- You bet your ass!

125
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:26,860
Change the whole line.
And bump it up another 300 gross.

126
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:30,671
You know, since my Zoe died,
I'm wearing nothing but costume made.

127
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:31,887
That's what this is all about.
Change.

128
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,743
That's what keeps
the spirit going...

129
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:36,613
that's what keeps
your "schvantz" growing.

130
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:39,371
Not to mention
a little help from...

131
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,351
the blue boys.

132
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:44,240
You gotta try some, Henry? They'll turn
your dick into the Terminator.

133
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,024
Well, that sounds very tempting, Sir,
but, no, thank you.

134
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:49,007
- And give that guy...
- Martin?

135
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,887
Martin! Yeah. Give him a raise,
but not too much!

136
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,676
- Yes, Sir.
- Alright, baby!

137
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,720
- Coming through, Mr. Feldman.
- Right! "Viva la vida!"

138
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,471
I'd like to remind you,
in 1997...

139
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,420
Fuck it.

140
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,970
Taxi!

141
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,887
- I'm so sorry.
- My Gosh! No, it's my fault...

142
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,992
- No, no.
- Please, forgive me.

143
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,920
You know, my husband
has this same briefcase.

144
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,789
- I just bought from on sale...
- Sale at Saks! I know.

145
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,640
It's kind of masculine,
but I think it's sexy.

146
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:23,503
Here you go.

147
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,347
Interesting.

148
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,318
Oh my God,
you're Madame Virginia.

149
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:33,001
Very nice.

150
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,077
These are excellent.
Is this you?

151
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,841
No!

152
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:41,838
Well, I'm the artist, so,
artistically speaking, they're "me."

153
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,551
Why? Do you like them?

154
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,518
Hold on, right?

155
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,293
Folks, keep moving.

156
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:17,199
<i>Clear the doors.</i>

157
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:20,110
<i>21st. Street.</i>
Next stop, 21st. Street.

158
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,594
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,443
Excuse me. I don't know.

160
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:52,806
Henry!

161
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,466
Henry!

162
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,518
Come to Paradise, Henry!

163
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:03,344
"Transformative moment",
your life will become clear.

164
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:05,231
"Transformative moment".

165
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,055
"Transformative moment".

166
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,144
<i>Your life will become clear.</i>

167
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:09,967
"Transformative moment".

168
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,789
- <i>"Transformative moment".</i>
- "Transformative moment".

169
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:14,864
- <i>"Transformative moment".</i>
- "Transformative moment".

170
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:17,584
- <i>Your life will become clear.</i>
- "Transformative moment".

171
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:20,431
<i>Clear. Clear.</i>
Clear.

172
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,190
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Here, why don't you sit down?

173
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:28,263
Thank you, Sir.

174
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:31,973
- Can you take this for me, thank you.
- Here you go.

175
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:33,899
Hey, watch it!

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,014
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

177
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,775
- I didn't mean it.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

178
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:38,800
- Alright. Are you alright?
- Yes.

179
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,574
- Good.
- Have a nice day.

180
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:10,316
- Keep the change. Thank you.
- Thanks for the tip, lady.

181
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:15,269
Hello?

182
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:19,141
Yes, Mr. Wong.
Of course, we're still on. Yeah.

183
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,024
Okay. Thank you.

184
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:26,724
You know, just don't come before
8:30 or you'll spoil the surprise party.

185
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,615
Yeah, I'm going to leave
the front door open for the guests...

186
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,318
but I'd like you to come in
through the back door, okay?

187
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah.
No, I'm looking forward to it.

188
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,174
Yes, I know your food
is delicious.

189
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:10,917
Through here.

190
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,707
And the second one
right to the back of the TV. Right.

191
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,567
Alright, come on.

192
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,446
Push the furniture back.
First, let's get the other one.

193
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,227
- How you doing, Henry?
- The usual, Tony.

194
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:28,197
- One Bud Lite coming up.
- Wait a minute. Make it a Tuborg.

195
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:29,991
Creature of habit my ass.

196
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,006
Tuborg?

197
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,814
- Tuborg it is.
- I never lock my briefcase.

198
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,599
Honey, where have you been?

199
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,520
You were supposed to be home
over an hour ago.

200
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,429
I mean, Vic and Gina
will be here any minute.

201
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,140
For your birthday dinner!

202
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,158
I mean, at least
you could have called.

203
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:16,110
What, did you miss the train?

204
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:20,903
Say something!

205
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:22,671
Yellow pages.

206
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,655
Yellow pages? Why do you want
the Yellow Pages?

207
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,364
- Were you in an accident?
- Let's see, travel agents.

208
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,341
No. They'd be closed by now.

209
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,320
- The airlines!
- The airlines?

210
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:38,116
What do you want the airlines for?
When you know Vic and Gina are coming?

211
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,767
Hello? Delta?
I knew it.

212
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,872
- I'd like to get two tickets please.
- Tickets?

213
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:46,704
- For tonight.
- What?

214
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:48,526
Anywhere in Europe.
Anywhere that's a hub.

215
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:51,439
London, Paris, Baghdad...

216
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,251
Strike that.
Calcutta?

217
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,208
- Don't we need shots for that?
- What's the matter with you?

218
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,346
- Are you on something?
- What's the departure time?

219
00:14:58,863 --> 00:14:59,594
Hang on.

220
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,541
How long is it going to take to get
to Newark Airport from here?

221
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,015
- You've been drinking!
- By taxi?

222
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,910
No, I can smell it
on your breath!

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,756
Don't hang up.

224
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,830
- Hang up the phone!
- Don't hang up!

225
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:14,510
Eight o'clock, taxi, eight thirty,
Newark, check in, security.

226
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,325
- I'd say by ten.
- I'm going to start getting angry...

227
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:19,432
- very, very soon!
- Hold on one second.

228
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:22,088
Don't hang up.
Carol, go pack.

229
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,011
Trust me.

230
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:25,867
Is this a joke?

231
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,048
Because if it's, it isn't funny.

232
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,770
Just pack one suitcase!
A small one.

233
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,719
Yeah, we'd like to make that
first class.

234
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,485
Just a change of underpants and we'll
buy everything else when we get there.

235
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,494
- Get where?
- Barcelona?

236
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,495
Excellent!

237
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,400
- 2200 hours. 2215 hours.
- Henry?

238
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:48,109
Excuse me, what's that
in real people time, you know?

239
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,747
- Ten fifteen p.m., excellent!
- Please, Henry, you're scaring me!

240
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:53,928
It's Perkins.

241
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:55,792
What?

242
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:57,767
No, one way only.
We're not coming back.

243
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,608
Carol, please, sweet,
I promise I'll tell you everything.

244
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,364
I'll explain it all.

245
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:07,375
Hello, Hoboken Cab?
Yes.

246
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,245
I need a car right away
to take two of us to Newark Airport.

247
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,964
Fifteen minutes, excellent!
Perkins, Forty Sinatra Drive.

248
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:15,884
Great, thanks.

249
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,862
- Henry!
- Carol! Carol, just listen.

250
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:22,605
No, you listen! You've been drinking
and it's affected your brain.

251
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:25,487
- Nothing's affected my brain.
- Booking one way tickets to Barcelona...

252
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,367
when we have dinner guests coming,
that's normal?

253
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:32,141
You know what? I think this is what
Doctor Rogers warned us about.

254
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,117
A mid-life crisis.

255
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,166
You think your life
is going nowhere.

256
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,879
It's probably not serious,
just a temporary breakdown.

257
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,765
I don't think it's a blood clot.

258
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:49,423
- What's that?
- What does it look like? It's money.

259
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,457
- What is it?
- It's five million dollars.

260
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,174
In cash and bearer bonds.

261
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:58,063
- But what is it?
- It's money, honey!

262
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,911
Moola!
Our ship has come in, honey!

263
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,910
We just have hit
the Donald "Freaking" Trump jackpot.

264
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,771
"He's fired."

265
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:07,752
Passports!

266
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:13,355
- How did this get into your briefcase?
- It's not my briefcase.

267
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,502
What do you mean?

268
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,464
Look, I was coming home on the train
like I always do.

269
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:21,166
And somehow I ended up with some guy's
briefcase that's exactly like mine.

270
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:25,836
- Why didn't you give it back to him?
- To who?

271
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,871
I didn't know it wasn't my briefcase
until I saw the five million.

272
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,687
How do you know
the exact amount?

273
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,679
- I counted it.
- On the subway?

274
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,423
No, on the toilet
at Barney's Tavern.

275
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,341
I knew you were drinking!

276
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:42,125
<i>It's my "transformative moment",</i>
as Mr. Rogers said.

277
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,175
Oh my God!

278
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,023
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

279
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,915
You okay, man?

280
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:50,703
<i>Yes.</i>

281
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,773
There I am, there it was.

282
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:57,485
- But it's not our money.
- It is now, go and pack.

283
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:58,634
Come on!

284
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,406
- It's stealing!
- Oh no!

285
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,167
I've give it
a lot of thought, Carol.

286
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,086
I figure the money's already
been stolen.

287
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:10,031
All unmarked bills,
bundled up in rubber bands.

288
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,910
Probably a payoff
to some drug dealer or something.

289
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,626
And I don't think anybody is thinking
about paying taxes on it.

290
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,702
Therefore,
the money doesn't exist.

291
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:20,426
And if it doesn't exist,
what did I steal!

292
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,541
Nothing!

293
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:22,476
Nada!

294
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:23,526
Zouch!

295
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,231
Zero!

296
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,287
Doughnut.

297
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:27,364
But, Henry.

298
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:29,293
This is insane!

299
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:31,084
My conscience is clear, Carol!

300
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:38,854
You know what? I've worked very hard
for more than twenty years.

301
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,645
I've devoted my life
to the artificial fruit business...

302
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:45,423
and at long last I've finally got
my golden apple...

303
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,293
and you know something?
It's not wax!

304
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,327
It's real.

305
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:51,152
- Okay?
- Well, wait.

306
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:54,063
We can't just fly to Barcelona
at a moment's notice.

307
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:54,991
Why not?

308
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,935
You want to go someplace else?
How about Bali?

309
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,037
Hell, honey, we can buy Bali!

310
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:03,631
- What about our family?
- What family?

311
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:05,765
I mean, no kids.

312
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,591
You're an orphan.

313
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,386
And my folks are dead.

314
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,463
No, they're not.
They're retired in Florida.

315
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,219
- Same thing.
- Well, and what about the police?

316
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:18,063
The police will never
get involved in this...

317
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:20,911
because nobody will ever report
this money missing.

318
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,976
Well, there's another reason
that I need to stay here tonight.

319
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:28,589
And that is that I finally showed
my artwork today to someone...

320
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,607
- and...
- No!

321
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:33,550
Are you nuts?
We can't even stay on the country.

322
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,535
I go to the office tomorrow,
I'm a dead man.

323
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,143
- Did you insult Mr. Feldman again?
- Not Mr. Feldman.

324
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,223
Mr. Nasty!
I have his briefcase.

325
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:45,936
If I have his briefcase, he has mine.
It's got all my stuff in it.

326
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,838
Tomorrow he will come to the office
looking for me and his briefcase.

327
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:51,855
But, by then,
we'll be thousands of miles away...

328
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:56,394
booked in some Spanish hotel
as Mr. and Mrs. Cha, cha, cha.

329
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:58,413
"Olé!"

330
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,701
What are you guys doing
down there?

331
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:09,257
- Get out of there!
- I'm calling the cops.

332
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:16,013
<i>It's not unusual to be rich</i>
Like no one else

333
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,818
Henry, I've never seen you
like this before.

334
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,895
That's because I've never felt
like this before.

335
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:25,580
How about a quickie?
Come on, I do all the work.

336
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:26,727
Henry, this isn't the time!

337
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,378
You're right. You're right.
The cab will be here any second.

338
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:31,492
I got an idea.

339
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,216
We can do it in the taxi
on the way to the airport.

340
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,063
But, Henry, something wonderful
happened to me today.

341
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,015
I'll say, we're rich!

342
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,957
- Oh, God!
- That'll be Vic and Gina.

343
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:44,845
You lose them,
I'll continue packing.

344
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,653
What will I tell them? They think
they're coming for pot roast.

345
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:51,566
I got it.
Here.

346
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:55,405
Tell them to go to the Rainbow Room.
It's on me!

347
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:58,213
I can't believe this.

348
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,942
Sorry it took me so long, I...

349
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,863
I thought you were...
I was expecting someone else.

350
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,751
Detective Sergeant Genero.

351
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,665
Hoboken Police.

352
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:18,542
Is there a problem, officer?

353
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:23,081
It's better I speak with the guy
who just came in here, Ms...

354
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,287
- Mrs. Perkins...
- Yeah.

355
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:30,885
My husband's upstairs at the moment,
but he'll be down shortly.

356
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:42,478
- Would you like a nut?
- No.

357
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,295
God, I'm so sorry.
They're honey glazed.

358
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,216
So they're a little sticky.

359
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,105
There's one on your...

360
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,701
I'm sorry for that. Henry!
That's my husband, Henry.

361
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,670
And those are probably
our friends Vic and Gina.

362
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,295
So, please, please,
would you please sit down?

363
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:07,398
Or don't.

364
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:10,279
Henry!

365
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,895
We're having dinner
here tonight.

366
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,927
Me and Henry.
Vic and Gina.

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,822
- It's his birthday.
- That's good.

368
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,538
- It's Henry's birthday, not Vic's.
- Lady, the door.

369
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:23,589
Sure.

370
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,416
I'm sure he'll be down
just momentarily...

371
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,390
because he's changing
in his birthday suit.

372
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:32,173
Gosh, he doesn't have
any clothes on.

373
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:35,119
Hey, are you people deaf or what?

374
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
- What?
- You don't turn it up to nine, lady.

375
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,096
I thought you were...

376
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,880
You thought I'll be here
in fifteen minutes but I made it in ten.

377
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,822
Just remember that when it's time
to tip the brother, alright?

378
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:43,823
Excuse me?

379
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,536
- I am your cab driver.
- Right, the taxi cab.

380
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,608
You know, actually
I'm stand-up comic, you know.

381
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,463
- By now I'm doing a sit down.
- How nice.

382
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,405
That's right,
I'll be a huge star, lady.

383
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:56,390
- Where are your bags?
- Bags?

384
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,037
Yeah, bags, lady,
and I'm not talking paper or plastic.

385
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:03,846
Hey, that's funny.
That kills at the Safeway.

386
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,653
Okay, where's your luggage
to airport?

387
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
The cab's not for me.
It's for my...

388
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:12,623
my sister.

389
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:16,300
Yeah, yes, she's staying with us,
but she'll be leaving tonight.

390
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,215
Wait, wait, wait,
the pick up here says, "Mr. Perkins".

391
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:22,214
No, no, no,
Mr. Perkins isn't going anywhere.

392
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,944
He just made the booking.

393
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:28,047
- He has no reason to leave.
- Alright.

394
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:30,830
Listen,
why don't you wait in the taxi...

395
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,579
- Angel.
- Angel, beautiful name.

396
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:37,456
My husband will down in a jumpy.
My sister isn't quite ready yet.

397
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:38,607
Where are they flying to?
What terminal?

398
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,233
I'm sorry?

399
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:42,408
Your sister.
What's her destination?

400
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,907
Australia.

401
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:53,797
Yes, yes, she's been here visiting us
and now she'll be returning...

402
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,791
to Sydney.

403
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:57,679
- Good. Down under?
- That's right.

404
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:59,631
Look, you tell
Mr. and Mrs. Crocodile Dundee...

405
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,247
- There's a Mr. and Mrs.?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:06,126
The pick-up says two people.

407
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:11,046
Of course, because that's my sister,
Leslie, and her husband...

408
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,893
Chris.

409
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,015
Chris!

410
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,687
- Yes!
- Great.

411
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,597
I'll be parked around the corner.

412
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:22,501
Okay, alright, see you.
In just... when my sister...

413
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:29,228
Okay, all packed! Just underpants,
deodorant and toothpaste.

414
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,278
- Honey?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:31,332
We have a visitor.

416
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,197
A visitor?

417
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:34,987
Oh, great, the cabbie!

418
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:38,023
- Detective Sergeant Genero.
- Really?

419
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,805
What's seems to be
the problem, detective?

420
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,628
It's my tune playing too loud again,
the neighbors complain, I know.

421
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,680
No, if your Mrs. doesn't mind,
I think it's better...

422
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,504
if we discuss our business
in private.

423
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,456
I'll just wait until
your sister-in-law is gone.

424
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:50,284
Sister-in-law?

425
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,359
- He's referring to Leslie.
- Leslie?

426
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:55,115
Yeah, she said they're
just about to leave.

427
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,167
- When he says "they"...
- Leslie and Chris.

428
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,077
- Leslie and Chris.
- Back down under.

429
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:01,934
- Back down under?
- Down under... Sydney.

430
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:03,787
Leslie, Chris and Sydney?

431
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,807
Thanks for bringing
their luggage down, honey.

432
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,736
My pleasure.

433
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,415
I don't think the Sergeant needs
to wait for Leslie and Chris to leave...

434
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:12,367
- do you?
- Absolutely not.

435
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:15,237
- That must be the cab.
- Angel's already here.

436
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,230
- Who's Angel?
- The cab driver.

437
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,051
But he's really a stand-up comic.

438
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:22,030
Then it's probably Vic and Gina then.
Get rid of them.

439
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,916
But we've invited them
to your birthday dinner.

440
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:26,000
Tell them, you know,
to leave their presents and go.

441
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:29,644
I want to keep my wife
for myself tonight, you know.

442
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,599
It's my birthday, not Vic's.

443
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:34,565
They'll understand.
Just tell them we're going to bed.

444
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,384
After I've satisfied
the Sergeant.

445
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:40,175
When I say satisfied,
sounds funny, I mean...

446
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:44,104
after I've helped him
in whatever the help needs.

447
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:45,161
Please.

448
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,887
- Henry, I can't cope!
- Yes, you can't.

449
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,551
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

450
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:55,493
She can.
She just thinks she can't.

451
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:58,414
Maybe I better answer the door.
Would you mind waiting in the kitchen?

452
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,334
- Don't be long, Perkins.
- I won't.

453
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,407
You said Mr. Nasty
wouldn't go to the cops.

454
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,407
Who said he did?

455
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:06,058
Why else would he want
to see you alone?

456
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:07,984
He doesn't know this isn't
my life savings.

457
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,806
Five million dollars?

458
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:11,846
- I've been frugal.
- I need a drink.

459
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,774
- You don't drink.
- I don't care.

460
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,551
Pull yourself together, Carol.
This is the happiest day of our lives.

461
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:26,384
Hey! You know
the meter's ticking, right?

462
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,207
- Meter?
- In the taxi, man.

463
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:31,247
Look here, I know waiting is part
of my job, but I hate waiting.

464
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,960
Unless it's for the lotto or a female
with some tigle bitties, who's easy.

465
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:39,629
You must be the hack comic, right?
Yeah, right, okay, get the suitcase.

466
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:42,630
- What about the policeman?
- Police? Now cops make me nervous.

467
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,464
The last time I got pulled over
for drunk driving...

468
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,616
a cop made me blow up a balloon.

469
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:48,299
- So what?
- It was the Goodyear blimp.

470
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,254
Then I got out and he said
I was too drunk to even walk.

471
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,142
I said, "Why the heck
do you think I'm driving?"

472
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,948
Very funny.

473
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:57,104
Okay, just wait in the taxi,
will you, Def Jam?

474
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,795
What about your in-laws,
are they going?

475
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,903
It's the in-laws that are going,
it's the outlaws.

476
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,630
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Whatever.

477
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:09,293
I can't go through with this.
It's making me a nervous wreck.

478
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,208
It's already driven me to drink.
You go without me.

479
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,248
How many times
do I have to tell you, Carol?

480
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:18,890
Tomorrow morning, Mr. Nasty
will call my office and get our address.

481
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,104
If he comes here
and you're still here...

482
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:22,790
he'll put you in the Cuisinart
and set to frappe...

483
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:26,639
and will chop, dice and stir you
into minced housewife.

484
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:28,491
And that'll be all
thanks to you.

485
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,559
- So they left?
- Who's that?

486
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,335
- Your wife's sister and her husband.
- Mr. and Mrs...

487
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,359
- Chris and Leslie.
- Chris and Leslie.

488
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:40,103
It's the last name that gets
the pronunciation thing...

489
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,858
Brown! That's right.

490
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,903
Sometimes I say Brom or Groim.

491
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:47,717
Oh, my God!

492
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:52,461
Carol, you're a bundle of nerves.
It's just Vic and Gina.

493
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,454
Don't forget to tell them you're
my surprise birthday present in bed!

494
00:28:58,288 --> 00:28:59,248
Henry!

495
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:02,183
She's so jumpy.
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,047
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, Gina!

497
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,935
I say "we", but that stupid
husband of mine...

498
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,758
is down in the street
yelling at a cabbie.

499
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:12,804
A cabbie?

500
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,655
He hit a taxi that was parked
on the street. Some little black guy.

501
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,640
- Of course Vic called him a...
- Angel!

502
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,323
No, I believe it was
a four letter word.

503
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,471
Gina, it's terrible.

504
00:29:23,248 --> 00:29:25,353
Henry's gone crazy.
He's in the kitchen now with the police.

505
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:28,144
Have I missed
a couple of sentences here?

506
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:30,191
- He stole five million dollars!
- Who has?

507
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:32,944
- Henry!
- Henry stole five million dollars?

508
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:34,768
He picked up the wrong briefcase,
went to a bar...

509
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,710
saw all this money,
and sat on the toilet, overcome...

510
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:39,533
You know, whole paragraphs
are disappearing now.

511
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:42,501
I was on a stakeout
tonight over Barney's Tavern.

512
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:44,396
- Barney's?
- Yeah.

513
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:46,438
I observed some pretty strange
behavior from you.

514
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:48,144
From me, strange?

515
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:49,998
- Well...
- How strange?

516
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,140
Very strange.

517
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:55,045
- Oh God! Shit.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:57,678
He bought a one-way ticket
to Barcelona.

519
00:29:57,744 --> 00:29:59,824
And if I don't like it there
he's going to buy Bali for me.

520
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:01,612
Carol, you're imagining all this.

521
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:04,428
We're talking about Henry here,
sweetheart.

522
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:08,495
Your Henry! Henry couldn't possibly
steal five million...

523
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:12,107
- Henry, you son of a bitch.
- What am I going to do?

524
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,223
I'd take Bali.

525
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,933
What a moron!
He's calling the cops!

526
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,054
Cops? More cops?

527
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,839
He says he's taking your sister
to Newark Airport.

528
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,904
I need a drink.

529
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,759
I think I need one
and so does Carol.

530
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,774
- Carol doesn't drink.
- She does now.

531
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:27,492
Old Bushmill. A double!

532
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,510
I'd kind of like to know
what you were doing in that toilet?

533
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:30,508
Toilet?

534
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,396
- What?
- The toilet?

535
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:36,335
I had
a little intestinal cash... gas.

536
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,124
Hey, don't bullshit me.

537
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,100
No, Sir.

538
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:44,780
And now Mr. Nasty is gonna chop,
dice and mince me!

539
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:46,662
Yeah, right.

540
00:30:48,784 --> 00:30:50,671
I'll be with you in a second,
Sergeant!

541
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,304
What's happened,
have you been arrested?

542
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,126
Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

543
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,133
My hair dresser Cynthia,
has a second cousin...

544
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,110
that body waxes Alan Dershowitz.
Should I call her?

545
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,950
- Henry, these are real?
- Carol! You shouldn't have told them!

546
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,606
I thought Vic could talk
some sense into you.

547
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,648
You were supposed to take
the present and blow them off.

548
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:14,608
- Charming.
- Nice.

549
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,423
And stop drinking, you're going
to make yourself sick. Give me that.

550
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,210
What did the Sergeant say?

551
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,221
He wasn't exactly satisfied
with my explanation.

552
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:23,119
I knew you should have turned
the money in.

553
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,264
You give it back, apologize.

554
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,191
Tell him you didn't realize
it was the wrong briefcase!

555
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:29,803
Take it easy! He doesn't know
anything about the money.

556
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,847
But you just said he wasn't satisfied
with your explanation.

557
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:34,831
About my behavior
in Barney's Tavern, that's what.

558
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,655
- What's he talking about?
- God only knows.

559
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,544
The cop was on a stakeout
at Barney's.

560
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,431
And he thought my behavior
was a little strange...

561
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:44,140
going in and out of the men's room,
back and forth then I confessed.

562
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,127
- Confessed to what?
- To soliciting.

563
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,172
Soliciting what?

564
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:49,158
Men.

565
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:50,884
I knew you were going
to do that.

566
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,814
Why would he think
you were soliciting men?

567
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,878
<i>Well, he claims he saw me go into</i>
the john four times in a half hour.

568
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,471
<i>And each time I came out, he said</i>
I looked more and more excited.

569
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:02,383
<i>Apparently I was also breathing heavily,</i>
and my hands were shaking...

570
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,489
<i>and I was flowing at the mouth.</i>

571
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,286
Anyway...

572
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:10,191
for ten thousand dollars
he won't say a thing.

573
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:12,110
You can't bribe a police officer!

574
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:14,859
Hey, I offered him five,
he wanted twenty...

575
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,007
we settled on ten.

576
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,756
Okay, tell the taxi driver
we'll be right down.

577
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,637
That taxi's going nowhere,
he's out of commission.

578
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,557
- Out of commission?
- Vic backed into him.

579
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:27,307
- That's not true, he backed into me.
- Now our bumpers are locked.

580
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,448
Well un-lock him, Vic!
I've got a plane to catch!

581
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:32,230
Take a look at him.

582
00:32:32,335 --> 00:32:34,063
You see what money
does to people?

583
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:36,071
Come on, Gina, I don't have to
take this. Screw the "nouveau riche."

584
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:38,794
Can you believe my Henry?
He's only been here ten minutes...

585
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:43,632
and he's already admitted to soliciting,
bribed a police officer and bought Bali.

586
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:44,784
And you married him.

587
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:47,598
- You lucky dog.
- Come on.

588
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,315
Ten thousand.

589
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,159
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

590
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,415
Hey, hey, hey! You're gonna dent
my fender, man! Come on.

591
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:17,230
- Shut up, or I'll dent your head!
- You couldn't dent a head of lettuce.

592
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,733
You wanna piece of me?

593
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,142
Hey, you know I think
I stepped in a piece of you.

594
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,957
Hey, hey, hey!
Larry and Curly?

595
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:24,136
- Knock it off!
- What did I do?

596
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:52,682
Rum.

597
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:56,493
Hello!

598
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,340
- Brandy.
- <i>Hello!</i>

599
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:04,203
Amaretto.

600
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:12,006
Excuse me.

601
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,823
- Oh my!
- I'm sorry. Are you Mrs. Perkins?

602
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:16,912
- Why? You selling something?
- No, no.

603
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,629
Detective Slater.
N.Y.P.D.

604
00:34:20,752 --> 00:34:22,410
- Homicide?
- That's right.

605
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:25,327
I'm afraid I have some rather
disturbing news for you, Ma'am.

606
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:28,293
We have reason to believe
Mr. Perkins, your husband...

607
00:34:29,263 --> 00:34:30,246
well, he's dead.

608
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:34,928
Dead in what sense?

609
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, two bullet holes through
the back of the head dead.

610
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,725
Bullets?

611
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:40,687
His body was dumped
in the East River.

612
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:42,672
- River?
- And his face is badly beaten.

613
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,606
Several ribs are broken.
We'll know more after the autopsy.

614
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,351
- So it wasn't an accident, then?
- No, no.

615
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:53,099
Maybe I should make you
a cup of coffee.

616
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,087
- Where's the kitchen?
- Over there.

617
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,971
No! No!

618
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,077
I don't drink!

619
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,726
I mean, I don't drink coffee.

620
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:11,340
So tell me. What makes you think
that this body is my Henry?

621
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,341
Although we found
no formal identification on him...

622
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,131
he still had his briefcase.

623
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:19,974
I'm so sorry.

624
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,846
This is your husband's briefcase,
isn't it?

625
00:35:24,943 --> 00:35:26,766
It's been in the river.

626
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:30,542
The police divers
recovered these.

627
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,440
That's the tuna sandwich
I made Henry.

628
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,125
He just loves the way
I mince the onions.

629
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,271
I'm sorry.

630
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:43,152
A formal identification
is going to be required.

631
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,981
No, this's definitely
a tuna sandwich...

632
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,775
Of the body.

633
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,785
Are you sure you okay?

634
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,607
Yes, I'm fine.

635
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,486
Heartbroken, but fine.

636
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,240
Okay, we can go in my car
if you like.

637
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,207
It's right across the Holland tunnel.
He's in the morgue there.

638
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:06,063
Should I wait here
while you go get your purse?

639
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,031
No, no. I'll rather
you wait down in your car.

640
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,742
Are you sure?
You look a little shaky.

641
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,640
Well, how would you feel
if your husband was just shot...

642
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:18,601
- and couldn't get to finish his lunch?
- Of course. Yeah, no.

643
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,492
Is there anybody else
in the house?

644
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,275
To look after you?

645
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:27,248
Yes.
There's my sister Leslie.

646
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,931
- Good. Sister?
- Yes, she's here.

647
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:33,709
She's here, and she's upstairs.
And she's with her husband.

648
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,750
And it's Leslie and Chris.

649
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:37,644
Would you believe?
One thousand short.

650
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:40,591
- Honey, say hello to...
- Slater...

651
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,565
- Hi, how are you?
- Detective Slater!

652
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:45,253
- Detective?
- N.Y.P.D.

653
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:48,368
He's brought some disturbing news that
I don't think that I'm quite sure...

654
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,261
how to handle it.

655
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:53,037
Why don't you sprawl out and relax
a little bit, sweet? You have a little...

656
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,037
No, I'm better standing.

657
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,790
It's easier to get to the drinks.

658
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,815
Okay, we go on three,
crapdriver!

659
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,872
- One, two...
- Asshole!

660
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:22,886
three!

661
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,637
The bumper!

662
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,582
Watch out.

663
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,281
No! No!

664
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:31,311
Damn!

665
00:37:57,296 --> 00:38:00,045
What seems to be
the problem, Detective?

666
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,149
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Perkins.

667
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:05,072
- Are you a relative, Sir?
- Of whom?

668
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:07,919
- Of Henry A. Perkins.
- I...

669
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:11,628
Yes, he is.
Henry's brother.

670
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,580
- Henry's brother?
- Yes!

671
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,357
He's poor, poor
Henry's dear brother.

672
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,294
I'm afraid
I have a shock for you, Sir.

673
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,037
We have pretty much every reason to
believe that Mr. Henry Perkins is dead.

674
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,967
- Yep, that's a shock, alright?
- He's been murder.

675
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,992
We fished his body
out of the East River.

676
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:33,774
- Kick the bucket.
- Two bullet on his head.

677
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:36,806
- Pushing up the old daisies.
- I get it, Carol. He's dead.

678
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,657
All he had with him
was his briefcase.

679
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:43,340
- This is your brother's?
- Oh God!

680
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,196
Oh God!

681
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,271
Oh God! Oh God!

682
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:50,031
Since Mrs. Perkins
is the next of kin...

683
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:52,966
we need her to make
a positive identification of the body.

684
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:54,925
Mr. Nasty...

685
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:57,805
Nasty.
It's a nasty, nasty thing.

686
00:38:57,872 --> 00:38:58,820
Henry!

687
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,816
You can't call him back, Carol!

688
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:03,434
If Henry has gone to Heaven
he's gone to Heaven.

689
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:07,497
You'll have to rely on me now.
His little brother...

690
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:10,406
- Freddy!
- Gilbert!

691
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,055
She's in shock.

692
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:17,925
Take a look at that strange guy
in front of Carol and Henry's.

693
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:20,747
What? You don't think
that's Mr. Nasty?

694
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,167
Actually,
it's Freddy Gilbert Perkins.

695
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,999
You'll have to excuse my wife.

696
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,720
Yes, my wife...
You'll have to excuse my wife.

697
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,792
I don't know where the heck
she could be.

698
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,191
I'm know she'd want to be here
to comfort Carol...

699
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,102
Bernice...
Bernice's my wife, of course.

700
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,174
She must be resting up
before we...

701
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,181
- take off for Sydney.
- Australia?

702
00:39:58,256 --> 00:40:01,040
- You're a long way from home.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

703
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:04,106
We had quite a nice walkabout
here in the States.

704
00:40:04,847 --> 00:40:08,622
And it's time now...
it's our lambing season.

705
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,687
We have some sharing to do,
and hunt down a few of those crocks...

706
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:14,597
and turn them out
into a few shrimps on the barbie...

707
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,518
We've got to tell Leslie and Chris
as well, Freddy.

708
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,238
Oh yeah.

709
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,091
That's going to put a damper
on the family reunion...

710
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:25,904
How about I make some coffee
while you stay on the den?

711
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:27,813
- But, Henry, my...
- My brother loved the den. It's...

712
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,606
On second thought,
he was very fond of the...

713
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:37,573
curb outside,
in front of the house.

714
00:40:39,344 --> 00:40:42,279
Extraordinary. He likes staying
out there. He can ruminate for hours.

715
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:45,034
- Why don't you wait outside?
- I'd rather wait up here.

716
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,948
I'm waiting.

717
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,869
- One thousand.
- Yeah, okay.

718
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:51,823
That's my other brother.

719
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,929
- Other brother?
- Yes, that's Archie.

720
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,513
We were in the middle of the game
of draughts. Draughts...

721
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:58,729
- You know, darts.
- Henry!

722
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:00,616
- It's no use calling him!
- Yeah, but, Henry...

723
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:05,199
She just can't accept that he's gone.
It's me, Freddy, Henry's brother.

724
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:06,279
Yeah, well...

725
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,107
what are we going to do?

726
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,029
We're going to pray.

727
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,000
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

728
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,788
Oh God almighty...

729
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:19,532
Detective, you seem like a man
who enjoys fine art.

730
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:21,551
Do you like Mapplethorpe?

731
00:41:49,327 --> 00:41:50,276
Excuse me.

732
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,267
Hello. What?

733
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,693
What are all the nude guys
doing out?

734
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,823
Listen to what
I'm trying to tell you.

735
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,584
I went to
the Soho Art Gallery today...

736
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:12,453
and "the" Madame Virginia...

737
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:14,406
loved "me."

738
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:16,231
My work, I mean.

739
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,084
She even told me
to call her "V".

740
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,865
Carol...

741
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,887
this is fantastic.

742
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:24,836
I know!

743
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:27,661
If Henry Perkins is dead,
nobody's coming after him.

744
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:32,708
- Henry, you were not listening to me.
- It had to be Mr. Nasty who got shot.

745
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,310
So he's not coming after us.

746
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,171
What's that?

747
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:45,093
- Give it to me.
- Hello?

748
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're saying.

749
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,702
- Who is it?
- I don't know he sounds foreign.

750
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:52,644
What?

751
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,662
He keeps saying "brerfcurse".

752
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:56,580
"Brerfcurse"?

753
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:59,310
"Brerfcurse, brerfcurse".

754
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:01,326
"Brerfcurse, brerfcurse".

755
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:02,439
Case. Case.

756
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:04,132
Give me that.

757
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:08,997
I'm sorry, the briefcase's moved
to Thailand. Good day.

758
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:13,706
Brerfcurse, brerfcurse!

759
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,549
- That was probably Mr. Big.
- Who's Mr. Big?

760
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:20,397
- The guy who shot Mr. Nasty.
- Why's he calling us?

761
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:24,238
Because we have Mr. Nasty's briefcase
with Mr. Big's money in it!

762
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,382
Henry!

763
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,265
- You'll never guess what we just did.
- Never mind, Vic.

764
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:30,991
- We have to get out of here right away.
- We can't go now!

765
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,130
- She's right... Mr. Nasty...
- Carol, you're bombed.

766
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,985
You're not making any sense.
I know what's best.

767
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:36,751
Oh yeah, Mr. Know-it-all.

768
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:38,831
Then you tell me
how we're gonna make a break for it...

769
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:40,686
with NYPD Blue
waiting in the den?

770
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,693
- N.Y.P.D. who?
- Never mind, Vic.

771
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:44,495
But Gina's outside with the body.

772
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:47,365
Yes, who's going to identify
the dead body?

773
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:50,406
- Dead body? No, no...
- Vic, please! Please!

774
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,304
- <i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>
- I think your briefcase is ringing.

775
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,093
- Don't answer it.
- It's him again.

776
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,984
- Who?
- Mr. Nasty.

777
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:56,975
No, it can't be
Mr. Nasty, he's...

778
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,048
You're right, you're right,
it's Mr. Big!

779
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,798
- Do I know Mr. Big?
- He's Mr. Brerfcurse.

780
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:04,560
- Mr. who?
- He's the guy who killed Mr. Nasty.

781
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:05,647
- He's foreign.
- Who is?

782
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,664
Mr. Brerfcurse.
He's Mr. Big.

783
00:44:07,698 --> 00:44:09,295
How did he get
your phone number?

784
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,303
It's not our phone,
it's Mr. Nasty's phone.

785
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,295
- I'm scared.
- Why?

786
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,237
Because, I think I'm starting
to understand you.

787
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:17,166
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

788
00:44:19,984 --> 00:44:20,878
Hey!

789
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:23,692
Come on, guys.

790
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:27,653
- Vic, didn't you tell them about...
- <i>Say hello to...</i>

791
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,582
- Perkins Residence.
- Gina! No!

792
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,248
- That wasn't very nice.
- You don't have to be nice to Nasty!

793
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,168
- I thought Mr. Nasty was dead?
- He couldn't be, he's...

794
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,077
- He is! I meant Mr. Big!
- Who's Mr. Big?

795
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,231
Here we go again...

796
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,149
Perkins.

797
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,815
Perkins.

798
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:57,285
Audio timeline: 8:31 p.m.
Arrived thirteen minutes ago.

799
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:02,091
I notified the widow
of her husband's demise...

800
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,938
I offered coffee
and a sympathetic shoulder.

801
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:06,796
Widow opted for Bushmill.

802
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,894
It's now 8:33 p.m.

803
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:12,842
Still waiting for in-laws
to depart.

804
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,424
My police instinct tells me
something is amiss...

805
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:19,333
I feel...

806
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,454
a danger lurking.

807
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,111
If Mr. Nasty is dead, then
who's the guy in the front porch?

808
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,717
Oh my God!
Mr. Feldman!

809
00:45:36,624 --> 00:45:37,703
Hello, Captain?

810
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,385
Yes, Sir.
Well, I am still here.

811
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,310
I know that, Captain.

812
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,488
Yes, I understand.
I...

813
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:48,138
I know you're hungry,
I'm simply...

814
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,287
Okay, let me just grab...

815
00:45:50,321 --> 00:45:52,970
Yeah, Vindaloo, Chippatti...

816
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:55,853
Poppadom, Bhajee...

817
00:45:59,664 --> 00:46:03,535
A little slower, Captain. This is
actually my first Indian take-out order.

818
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:07,310
So bear with me.
How do you spell Vindaloo?

819
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,423
Capitan? Hello?

820
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,279
<i>You idiot.</i>

821
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:14,152
Sorry about that,
a little technical...

822
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:16,879
How do you spell Vindaloo,
Captain?

823
00:46:16,913 --> 00:46:17,959
Captain? Captain?

824
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,048
He's soaking wet.
What did you do to him?

825
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,903
Vic hit him
with your birthday present.

826
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,815
- You didn't!
- Yeah, '89 Obrion.

827
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:46,639
- You didn't!
- I did.

828
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:47,752
Really?
It's a fabulous year.

829
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:51,402
- Would somebody tell me who this guy is?
- He's Henry's boss.

830
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:56,366
- Welcome to our home, Mr. Feldman!
- I thought he was Mr. Nasty.

831
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:58,155
He pulled a knife on me.

832
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:01,100
Cigar clippers?

833
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:04,039
What? Did you think
he was gonna give you a pedicure?

834
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,701
I haven't forgotten about you.
Coffee'll be a sec.

835
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:17,284
No.

836
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:19,397
Don't worry, he's alive.

837
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:22,086
Grandpa's got a boner the size
of the Chrysler Building!

838
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,942
That's because
he's been using the stiff stuff.

839
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:26,924
I've been talking to Vic
about using these.

840
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:28,901
- Gina!
- What'd I say?

841
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:30,917
It's not like he has
a major problem, or anything.

842
00:47:31,888 --> 00:47:33,644
Sometimes...

843
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:35,664
and only sometimes
I lose my concentration...

844
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:37,519
it's no trouble rising
to the occasion...

845
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,407
it's just that I tend to leave
the party early.

846
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:42,286
- It's too much info, Vic.
- It is. It is.

847
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:47,045
Carol, what's Mr. Feldman
doing here anyway?

848
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,054
I invited him
for your birthday dinner.

849
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:53,706
Henry, this is an omen. This is God
telling you to give the money back.

850
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:55,782
I'll deal with God
when we get to Barcelona.

851
00:48:06,352 --> 00:48:07,334
Oh God!

852
00:48:08,272 --> 00:48:10,247
- We're dead.
- How did he get our phone number?

853
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,938
Because Miss Howard Stern
gave him our last name.

854
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,909
Birthday boy, that's it.
Gina, we're out of here!

855
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:17,870
Can't we wait until intermission?

856
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:20,783
Your phone's ringing.

857
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,655
Phone ringing?
I don't hear a phone ringing?

858
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:27,306
It must be the telly upstairs.

859
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:30,342
Maybe your ears are plugged.

860
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:34,157
Please. Give us a minute.
We're grieving.

861
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:37,867
- This is a painful time for us.
- Very painful.

862
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:39,975
Pulsingly.

863
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,548
Hey, Perkins!

864
00:48:48,655 --> 00:48:50,346
Alright, what are you doing?

865
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:51,462
Time is money, you know.

866
00:48:51,535 --> 00:48:53,477
I'm out of one here
and waiting on the other. "Capice"?

867
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:01,030
Hello?

868
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:02,919
Yeah, just a minute.

869
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:06,701
Hi, mom, how's the laryngitis.

870
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,701
Yeah, okay,
I love you too. Bye.

871
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:17,350
Hey, snap it up.

872
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,344
You didn't forget about the rest
of your charitable contribution...

873
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:23,467
to my policemen fund, did you?
I mean, it's tax deductible.

874
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:27,015
Are any of you crazy ass white
going to Newark Airport tonight?

875
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:29,712
Because my meter's running like
a crack head mama's VCR.

876
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:31,686
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Brown.
My in-laws.

877
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:34,512
- No, you mean the outlaws.
- No!

878
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:35,526
I know what I mean,
you know what I mean?

879
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,615
Why don't you wait outside?

880
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:39,312
I ain't hanging around here
all damn night.

881
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:40,368
I'm giving you five minutes,
you got that?

882
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:43,302
One, two, three, four, five and "adiós".
I'm out of here, you got that?

883
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,967
And I better get a fat ass tip,
you know what I mean?

884
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:48,103
They'll be less than that.
Here, here.

885
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,719
Take the Brown's bag, okay?

886
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:54,607
What, just one suitcase?
Traveling all the way from Australia?

887
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:55,599
Yes.

888
00:49:56,592 --> 00:49:57,679
What are they, nudists?

889
00:49:57,713 --> 00:49:58,628
Yes.

890
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:01,292
Crazy ass nudists.

891
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,149
He's got a point there. Two people,
round the world trip with one suitcase?

892
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:11,022
- Hey, are they nudists?
- Only when they take their clothes off.

893
00:50:13,808 --> 00:50:15,847
I'm just thinking maybe you and your
wife are the ones who's go on a trip.

894
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,757
- No, no, no.
- Where are they then, these in-laws?

895
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:20,652
- Chris and Leslie?
- Yeah.

896
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,370
Leslie's outside, isn't he, Henry?

897
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:24,551
That's correct.

898
00:50:25,296 --> 00:50:26,441
And I'm Chris.

899
00:50:27,343 --> 00:50:29,231
Yes, this is Chris.

900
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:32,198
My wife's sister, from Sydney.

901
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:33,929
Oh my God!

902
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,879
Oh my God!
My sister is from Sydney?

903
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:38,862
This gotta stop!

904
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:40,743
Enough!

905
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,570
Enough!

906
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,370
<i>This gotta stop!</i>

907
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,116
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go.

908
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:53,168
Leslie! Oh my God, good day.

909
00:50:53,201 --> 00:50:54,223
- Good day?
- Yes, good day. Yes.

910
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:58,020
I was just talking with the dingo here
from the kitchen...

911
00:50:58,095 --> 00:50:59,983
- Oh, the kitchen!
- Yes, the kitchen.

912
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:02,831
About the ten thousand.
Yes, yes.

913
00:51:05,712 --> 00:51:06,759
I believe we're even.

914
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,349
Well, be careful
crossing the street, Sergeant.

915
00:51:10,448 --> 00:51:12,495
We wouldn't want anyone
running you over like a dog...

916
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:15,245
and leave you squirming
and writhing in the street.

917
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:18,159
Thanks for your concern, Perkins.
It touches me.

918
00:51:18,193 --> 00:51:21,061
But if I thought I was in
any danger at all out here...

919
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:23,852
I mean I'd just blast that car and...
bang-bang.

920
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:27,727
Yeah, I shoot the insides
out of a cannoli.

921
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:30,724
Anyway...

922
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:33,479
this has been rewarding.

923
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:36,235
I can't wait to come back
for a visit.

924
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:37,285
Now you'll be safe.

925
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:40,295
I look forward to see you.

926
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,832
Thank God, he's gone!
Now I feel like a drink.

927
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:47,919
I feel like a cigarette.

928
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:49,743
Maybe I should go out
and come back in again?

929
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:50,856
Shut up, Vic,
and help me move him.

930
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,542
Alright, grab his feet.

931
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:54,696
Let's get him up.

932
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,480
Mr. Perkins?

933
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,295
Excuse me.

934
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:06,030
Detective? Are you through
with licking the statues' ass?

935
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:07,883
Yes.

936
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:12,682
No, that...

937
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,469
The body's waiting at the morgue.
We really must be going...

938
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:24,392
I know, I know the feeling.

939
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,077
Listen, we ought to get you
washed up first.

940
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,102
You know I'd love if you'd make
the coffee. It's in the cupboard.

941
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,931
I like mine black.

942
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:43,370
This is weird, watching you take off
another man's pants.

943
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:46,439
- I'm in the medical profession.
- You're a dental hygienist.

944
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,829
What the hell are you two doing?

945
00:52:54,896 --> 00:52:56,880
This suit is drenched.
Do you want him to catch pneumonia?

946
00:52:56,914 --> 00:53:00,622
Well, show the man some dignity.
He's naked for God's sakes.

947
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:01,798
Holly salami.

948
00:53:04,688 --> 00:53:06,444
We're never gonna make
that flight.

949
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:08,330
Vic, cover him up.

950
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,407
These babies really last.

951
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,052
Hello?

952
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,982
Yes, this is Henry Perkins.

953
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,909
I made a reservation earlier tonight
for two to Barcelona at 10:15.

954
00:53:19,983 --> 00:53:21,925
What's the next flight out?
Very good.

955
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,909
Can you get to Greece from there?

956
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,799
Excellent, 11:07.
Thank you.

957
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,693
Greece?

958
00:53:28,688 --> 00:53:31,557
- How romantic.
- Don't tell her, Gina. It's a surprise.

959
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:34,439
What now?

960
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,174
Carol!

961
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:38,212
Jesus!

962
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,087
<i>What's up, Angel?</i>

963
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:44,740
My blood pressure?

964
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:47,696
I'm still waiting on this wacky couple
to go to Newark Airport.

965
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:51,438
<i>There's a broke down limo eight blocks</i>
from you. You want the fare?

966
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,283
Screw that naked fools.

967
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:07,819
Mr. Perkins, coffee's ready!

968
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:08,932
For Christ sake!

969
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,815
Do you mind?
I'm taking a bath.

970
00:54:12,591 --> 00:54:13,671
Mrs. Perkins?

971
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:21,228
"Greece, 11:07."

972
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:23,120
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

973
00:54:23,153 --> 00:54:26,087
- It's better than going to jail.
- We're not going to jail.

974
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:28,078
Betty Ford maybe, but not jail.

975
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:29,998
- Leave me alone!
- Carol, stop it!

976
00:54:30,063 --> 00:54:32,845
I need privacy.
Everybody out!

977
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:39,656
Hey, Perkins?

978
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:53,838
Audio timeline: 8:55 p.m.
A major clue discovered.

979
00:55:01,487 --> 00:55:04,302
8:55, 17 seconds,
a second major clue.

980
00:55:06,543 --> 00:55:10,089
Three! Three!
That's three major clues...

981
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,200
in roughly under 44 seconds!

982
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,765
- Do me a favor, will you, Leslie?
- Call me Vic.

983
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,767
Vic!

984
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:20,870
Give this to that neurotic cabby.
Will you see do he stays here.

985
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,629
Perkins?

986
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:28,400
What are you two hiding
under the blanket?

987
00:55:28,433 --> 00:55:29,512
We weren't expecting you back,
Sergeant.

988
00:55:30,256 --> 00:55:31,433
- Right, Leslie?
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.

989
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,247
- Is that why you look so guilty?
- Guilty? We're just sitting here.

990
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:36,240
We're relaxing.
Kicking the heck, you know.

991
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:37,167
What a night!

992
00:55:37,263 --> 00:55:38,954
I was outside "noodleing".

993
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:40,839
My guts brought me here.

994
00:55:42,736 --> 00:55:44,558
I don't buy a story anymore.

995
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:46,696
Why not? I thought
it was a good one.

996
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:49,456
I mean, first, you brag about
getting lucky on your birthday...

997
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:51,365
bumping skin with the old lady.

998
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,407
And then fast as you can squeeze out
a fart, you confessed me you're a fag.

999
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:58,117
There's a very, very, very good
explanation for that.

1000
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:00,908
- You've got my attention.
- Yeah, mine too.

1001
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:02,983
- Carol, my wife...
- Yeah?

1002
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:07,814
This is the real "me!"
Thanks to Doctor Rodgers...

1003
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:09,736
not you!

1004
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:11,468
Carol!

1005
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,509
- She's a man!
- A man?

1006
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,295
Keep it down, Leslie,
you know how sensitive he is?

1007
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,215
Transsexual, actually.

1008
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,208
A very prominent Beverly Hills doctor
had the operation a couple years ago.

1009
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:24,966
Cost us a fortune.

1010
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,960
That doc sure did a helluva job.

1011
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:27,942
A hell of a job.

1012
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,871
You don't think I can tell
the difference...

1013
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:31,664
between a scungili
and a calamari?

1014
00:56:31,698 --> 00:56:32,776
So, what can we do for you,
Sergeant?

1015
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,662
Nothing, your cabby split. He left
your suitcase right in the street.

1016
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,240
- How thoughtful of you.
- I wouldn't want anybody to reap it off.

1017
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,014
- That guy scares me.
- He scares me too.

1018
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,175
- Hey, give me the keys to your car.
- What for?

1019
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,894
To get to the airport.
You heard, the cab is gone.

1020
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,856
- You can't take my car.
- I'll give you five thousand.

1021
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:52,943
- Ten.
- Seven and five.

1022
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:54,569
- Done.
- Done.

1023
00:56:56,751 --> 00:57:00,526
9:04 p.m. I have assemble
the victim's entire...

1024
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:06,378
I suspect that the victim was a male,
roughly 5'11", maybe 5'12".

1025
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,127
5'11", 188 pounds, I think.

1026
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:13,103
By the look of it I would say
there's definitely a...

1027
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:15,918
naked and dead body
somewhere in this house.

1028
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:20,582
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1029
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,552
Cinderella,
your coach has arrived.

1030
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,981
Is it true what they say
about you red hairs?

1031
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:37,904
Is it true what they say
about cabbies?

1032
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:39,791
Hell, yeah!

1033
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:41,700
What they say?

1034
00:57:42,704 --> 00:57:44,720
Okay, here's your seven and five
hundred, Mr. Best Friend.

1035
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:45,647
Thank you.

1036
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:51,212
Mr. Perkins, something smells rotten
and I don't like it.

1037
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:52,304
It wasn't me.

1038
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,159
You must be
Mrs. Perkins' brother-in-law.

1039
00:57:54,256 --> 00:57:56,078
- Brother?
- Brother.

1040
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:58,151
Mr. Perkins, did you know there's
a naked dead man in your house?

1041
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,973
No, no, it was an accident.
I was totally self-defense.

1042
00:58:01,071 --> 00:58:04,650
- Where is he?
- Well, I don't know yet.

1043
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,807
I've only found his clothes.

1044
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:07,717
So you don't really know
that he's dead?

1045
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,508
- You only know that he's naked.
- I'll tell you what I do know.

1046
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:11,663
These clothes contain
blood splatters...

1047
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,487
which could only come from
a gunshot wound...

1048
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:17,229
caused by a Ruger Super Red Hawk .44
Magnum with a Hologram Scope.

1049
00:58:17,296 --> 00:58:19,183
Or a bottle of Château Obrion.

1050
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,068
Likely story.

1051
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,842
I got a big nose.
Robust.

1052
00:58:25,136 --> 00:58:27,754
- It's the '89?
- Excellent!

1053
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,495
Hey, somebody's got to make
a liquor run.

1054
00:58:32,529 --> 00:58:34,350
- Well, she's in for the night.
- Carol?

1055
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:36,357
Detective, I'd like you to meet
my sister-in-law.

1056
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:39,246
Leslie, let's go downstairs
and have a cup of coffee.

1057
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,117
What did the fish say
when he's hanging in the wall.

1058
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,076
- What?
- Damn!

1059
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,891
Why Snoop Dogg carry
an umbrella?

1060
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,869
- Why don't you tell me?
- For drizzle.

1061
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:50,790
That's so not funny.

1062
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,728
We have to hide the briefcase
before Slater sees it.

1063
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,591
<i>Mr. Perkins?</i>

1064
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:01,284
Mr. Perkins?

1065
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:02,340
<i>Mr. Perkins?</i>

1066
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:09,996
Henry, the oven!

1067
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,102
Detective?

1068
00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:33,834
Where did you go?

1069
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:34,951
Mr. Perkins?

1070
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,774
Who's going to identify the body?

1071
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:39,846
What body, Henry?

1072
00:59:40,591 --> 00:59:42,479
I told you not to use
that name, Leslie.

1073
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:44,551
- What name, Henry?
- That name, Leslie.

1074
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:50,189
I might just break down
and weep like a baby.

1075
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,782
- He does know, doesn't he?
- Yes, he knows! I've told him!

1076
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,704
- Told me what?
- That Henry Perkins is dead.

1077
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:03,784
Dead?

1078
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,607
How do you mean, dead?

1079
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,542
- I thought you just said you told him?
- I did tell him, I just got so far as...

1080
01:00:10,384 --> 01:00:14,255
tell him that Henry
wasn't looking too well.

1081
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:17,125
His body was found with
two bullet holes in the East River.

1082
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:19,206
I guess that would explain
why he wasn't looking too well.

1083
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,926
I was trying to break it
to him gently.

1084
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,643
He was identified
by his briefcase.

1085
01:00:27,664 --> 01:00:31,373
Oh yeah! His "brerfcurse".
That's why Carol's so upset...

1086
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:34,373
poor, dear Carol.

1087
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:39,115
It's good thing
her brother-in-law was here.

1088
01:00:39,215 --> 01:00:41,103
- Yes.
- I thought I was her brother-in-law.

1089
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:44,848
You are! We both are,
just from different sides of the family.

1090
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:46,757
That's something else I know,
isn't it?

1091
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:49,766
Now do you see why I had
to break it to him slowly?

1092
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,503
He hasn't been the same
since he fell off that kangaroo.

1093
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:57,322
Henry had two brothers-in-law...

1094
01:00:57,551 --> 01:01:00,170
you, Leslie...

1095
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,149
and me, Freddy.

1096
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,928
Because Henry's dead. Yes!

1097
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:07,855
Tragic.

1098
01:01:07,984 --> 01:01:08,966
Yes.

1099
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,887
Now everybody in the family
knows Henry's dead.

1100
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:13,643
Dead, dead, dead.

1101
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,694
Chris and Leslie.

1102
01:01:15,824 --> 01:01:17,515
And Carol.

1103
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,367
And my wife Bernice.

1104
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,243
And me, reliable Freddy.

1105
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:26,987
- What about Archie?
- Who's Archie?

1106
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,951
I don't remember who Archie is.

1107
01:01:36,688 --> 01:01:37,711
This is it.

1108
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:39,686
Here? Come on,
you don't want to go in there.

1109
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,470
Trust me, it's easier to stay out
than to get out.

1110
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,310
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Hey, doll.

1111
01:01:48,144 --> 01:01:50,086
Do you believe in love
at first sight...

1112
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,174
or do I have to walk by again?

1113
01:01:52,207 --> 01:01:53,898
Keep walking.

1114
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:00,677
Hello?

1115
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,632
Anybody home?

1116
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,306
Mrs. Perkins?

1117
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:09,412
It's...

1118
01:02:11,184 --> 01:02:12,263
Madame Virginia.

1119
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:14,254
<i>Mrs. Perkins?</i>

1120
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:19,846
Yummy.

1121
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:28,553
- Is Archie still here?
- No, Archie had to leave.

1122
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:30,511
You guys saw
that good looking broad come in here?

1123
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:31,471
He's back!

1124
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:33,260
- What?
- He is?

1125
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,302
- Nice to see you again, Archie.
- What are you talking about?

1126
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,119
I said it's good
to see you again, Archie.

1127
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,988
I don't think you've officially met
my brother Archie...

1128
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:43,886
Detective Slater?

1129
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,734
- Please.
- Are you a cop?

1130
01:02:45,808 --> 01:02:46,702
N.Y.P.D.

1131
01:02:46,768 --> 01:02:49,583
This is my big brother,
Archie Perkins.

1132
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:57,228
Yes, Archie Perkins,
damn glad to meet you!

1133
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,334
I hate him!

1134
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:02,959
I wish he'd fall
into a vat of hot wax...

1135
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:04,967
and get molded
into a giant corn on the cob!

1136
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:07,941
<i>What happened to my Henry?</i>
The Henry I fell in love with?

1137
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:10,597
The Henry that used to paint
my toe nails?

1138
01:03:10,672 --> 01:03:14,534
You know, Carol, if my husband brought
home a briefcase full of money...

1139
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,542
- I'd be out the door in a flash.
- Well, It's not about the money.

1140
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:19,400
<i>Tonight was going to be</i>
my night.

1141
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,972
I was finally
going to be discovered.

1142
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,008
Honey, don't you think
you're a little bit over dressed?

1143
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:43,172
Who are you?

1144
01:03:44,368 --> 01:03:46,091
Where am I?

1145
01:03:46,192 --> 01:03:49,159
Is this a fantasy?
It must have cost me a fortune.

1146
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:51,910
Is this a dream?

1147
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:54,762
No, I'm real.

1148
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:57,547
N.Y.P.D. is a little out of your
jurisdiction, isn't it?

1149
01:03:57,648 --> 01:04:00,559
I'm waiting for Mrs. Perkins
to accompany me to the morgue...

1150
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:02,469
to identify the body.

1151
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,528
- There's a body now?
- Doesn't he know, Freddy?

1152
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:06,219
Freddy, is it?

1153
01:04:06,288 --> 01:04:10,249
The sad thing about it, Archie,
is that Henry's dead.

1154
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,070
No!

1155
01:04:13,072 --> 01:04:13,999
Freddy!

1156
01:04:14,064 --> 01:04:16,080
You know, last time I saw him
I thought he looked a bit pale.

1157
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,730
He was shot in the head
and drowned in the river, Archie.

1158
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,654
He always had
suicidal tendencies.

1159
01:04:20,784 --> 01:04:22,572
We suspect murder.

1160
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:24,583
Murder?

1161
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:31,206
Leslie, why don't you take
brother Archie up on the roof...

1162
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:35,088
and discuss what kind of cash he may
be gaining from Henry's will, poor Henry.

1163
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,095
Freddy, I don't think
the roof's a good idea.

1164
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,781
- Yeah, I think it's a very good idea.
- Freddy!

1165
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:41,710
- You can fill in the blank spots for me.
- Don't worry.

1166
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:42,855
There are too many blanks.

1167
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:46,695
- Well, now, how about that...
- Don't say coffee.

1168
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,454
I want Mrs. Perkins now!

1169
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,439
Well, now, Detective...

1170
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:55,334
I realize she's an available woman, but
don't you think it's a little soon...

1171
01:04:56,112 --> 01:05:00,006
after her husband's demise
to be thinking that sort of thing?

1172
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:03,792
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I'll just pretend I never heard it...

1173
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:04,686
Mr. Perkins?

1174
01:05:04,783 --> 01:05:06,726
Surprise!

1175
01:05:07,728 --> 01:05:10,630
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1176
01:05:10,735 --> 01:05:14,281
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy</i>

1177
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:20,014
Damn safety cap.

1178
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:24,910
- <i>Henry, where are you going?</i>
- Come back in here.

1179
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,782
Why're those people singing
"happy birthday Henry" to you?

1180
01:05:28,848 --> 01:05:31,531
There's a very good reason.

1181
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:32,588
Yes?

1182
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:35,557
Henry and I are twins.

1183
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:38,415
Identical.

1184
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,353
Identical twins.

1185
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:45,221
My, my, my, this is getting
more complicated by the minute.

1186
01:05:45,968 --> 01:05:47,855
And you call yourself
a detective...

1187
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:51,781
Maybe this case is just a little too big
for the N.Y.P.D.?

1188
01:05:52,944 --> 01:05:54,735
I tell you what,
while I go out there...

1189
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:56,710
and explain to those people
about poor Henry.

1190
01:05:58,512 --> 01:05:59,526
I'm sorry.

1191
01:05:59,632 --> 01:06:03,407
You stay here and you make that coffee.
It's in the cupboard.

1192
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,148
Twins.

1193
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:10,927
And?

1194
01:06:11,023 --> 01:06:13,935
And he has two first class tickets
to Greece!

1195
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:14,917
And?

1196
01:06:15,696 --> 01:06:16,776
That's all I know.

1197
01:06:23,376 --> 01:06:25,351
It was Michelangelo.

1198
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:29,168
No, it was Da Vinci
who said that...

1199
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:32,135
"Man is in the wrong
to be ashamed to exhibit it...

1200
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:34,952
he ought to adorn
and display it."

1201
01:06:35,055 --> 01:06:36,752
Let's face it.

1202
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:41,705
Women everywhere dream of going with
an Italian named Marcello to Venice.

1203
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:45,387
You ever hear of a chick wanting to go
with a Jew named Murray to Tel Aviv?

1204
01:06:45,456 --> 01:06:49,231
Well, unless he's charming,
good-looking, smart, funny...

1205
01:06:49,392 --> 01:06:52,359
- sexy...
- Did I mention I was rich?

1206
01:06:53,328 --> 01:06:54,222
So am I.

1207
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:01,830
- Happy birthday, Henry.
- Thanks, Steve, thanks for coming.

1208
01:07:02,703 --> 01:07:03,718
Everybody?

1209
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:04,782
Everybody...

1210
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:07,566
I just want to say
"thank you very much".

1211
01:07:07,663 --> 01:07:09,606
You really did surprise me.
Thank you.

1212
01:07:10,352 --> 01:07:12,490
My friend Henry Perkins.
A regular guy if ever I knew one.

1213
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,368
Henry's as regular as Exlax!

1214
01:07:16,143 --> 01:07:18,991
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that
Henry Perkins doesn't exist anymore.

1215
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:21,870
In fact, Henry Perkins is dead.

1216
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:23,790
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1217
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:27,653
- Doesn't anybody like the guy?
- I don't know.

1218
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:31,621
I said cream and sugar, didn't I?
Come on. There's a party going on here.

1219
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,469
<i>Open this door, Carol.</i>

1220
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,341
Oh my God, Carol!
What have you done?

1221
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:43,215
Wake up!
Wake up, Carol!

1222
01:07:43,249 --> 01:07:44,971
- Please, wake up!
- Gina!

1223
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,821
Tonight's party is a theme party.

1224
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:49,741
I'm sure Carol
told everything to you...

1225
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,814
when she set
this incredible thing up.

1226
01:07:51,919 --> 01:07:53,808
I don't know where she is.
She's probably upstairs doing her nails.

1227
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:56,459
She should be down by breakfast.

1228
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,469
Come on, honey, open wide.

1229
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:01,226
<i>Anyway, anyway.</i>

1230
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,407
It's a murder mystery.

1231
01:08:03,183 --> 01:08:05,158
Henry's been shot
in the head twice.

1232
01:08:06,288 --> 01:08:09,997
Nobody knows who's done it.
It could be anybody here.

1233
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:16,648
We hired two actors
to play police detectives.

1234
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,475
So that'll make it
a little more interesting.

1235
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,487
<i>And remember, I'm...</i>

1236
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:24,333
Henry's evil twin...

1237
01:08:24,463 --> 01:08:25,391
Freddy!

1238
01:08:33,903 --> 01:08:38,759
The blue represents all the dark
midnights of a starving New York artist.

1239
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,640
- Its simplicity is it's genius!
- Yes.

1240
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:44,362
Just like my wax blueberries.

1241
01:08:44,463 --> 01:08:46,438
You know, it's great
that we're both in the arts.

1242
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:49,194
Yours hangs on museum walls...

1243
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,198
and mine sits on kitchen tables.

1244
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,967
Mr. Feldman?

1245
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,918
- Stan Martin.
- Who are you?

1246
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:57,063
I work for you.

1247
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,912
- Bruised bananas.
- Oh yeah, Martin, the wiz kid.

1248
01:09:00,945 --> 01:09:02,640
Why don't you whiz on
over to the bar...

1249
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:04,495
and grab us a couple of glasses
of chardonnay?

1250
01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:05,606
Sure.

1251
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:08,299
What happened?

1252
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,416
So far my pleading ignorance
has cost you a hundred grand.

1253
01:09:10,449 --> 01:09:12,303
- A hundred grand?
- Well, first he wanted fifty...

1254
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:15,152
for not spilling the beans about Henry,
Leslie, Freddy and Archie.

1255
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:16,112
What about the other fifty?

1256
01:09:16,145 --> 01:09:18,054
For not spilling the beans
about Carol being a man.

1257
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,816
- What?
- That's what happens...

1258
01:09:20,849 --> 01:09:22,703
when you leave the room
for five minutes.

1259
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,919
Where's Captain corruptness now?

1260
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:25,675
Up on the roof singing,
"If I was a rich man".

1261
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:27,629
Vic?

1262
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:33,220
I just want you to know that your wife
not only broke our bathroom door...

1263
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,110
but she assaulted my person.

1264
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,159
Carol, you can't go to the airport
dressed like that?

1265
01:09:38,223 --> 01:09:39,979
That's because I'm not going.

1266
01:09:40,047 --> 01:09:42,063
I'm not going to spend the rest
of my life "on the lamb."

1267
01:09:42,097 --> 01:09:45,031
For God's sakes, Carol, just go!
Henry needs looking after.

1268
01:09:45,776 --> 01:09:47,816
- Yeah, he can find someone else.
- Don't think I couldn't.

1269
01:09:47,919 --> 01:09:50,505
I can think of a thousand women
who would jump at the chance.

1270
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,680
- Yeah? Name one!
- Gina Johnson.

1271
01:09:55,536 --> 01:09:56,397
You what?

1272
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:59,147
That is, if you don't mind and,
you know...

1273
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,098
Henry would take me.

1274
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:03,116
Is there something wrong
with my hearing?

1275
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:06,794
Very well. I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

1276
01:10:06,896 --> 01:10:08,903
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have party guests to attend to.

1277
01:10:08,976 --> 01:10:10,667
Get a grip of yourself.

1278
01:10:17,487 --> 01:10:18,502
Thank you.

1279
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,415
Carol always did know
how to make an entrance.

1280
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:23,239
Hi, Bill.

1281
01:10:23,312 --> 01:10:24,239
Thanks.

1282
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,125
Mary Ann, great to see you.

1283
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:36,555
Joe, it's the best score
I ever made.

1284
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:38,543
And I didn't have
to whack anybody either.

1285
01:10:38,577 --> 01:10:39,688
Come on, we're late.

1286
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:50,953
Everybody let's kick up!

1287
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,908
Mr. Perkins?

1288
01:10:57,872 --> 01:11:00,527
Mr. Perkins, I have had it!

1289
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,502
- Where did you go, detective?
- No, no, no.

1290
01:11:02,576 --> 01:11:03,558
That's enough of that.

1291
01:11:04,336 --> 01:11:06,223
I've had with that.

1292
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,131
Okay.

1293
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:13,158
Who's booked
on a 11:07 flight to Greece?

1294
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:14,955
Let me see that.

1295
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:17,773
That's isn't a reservation
for an airline.

1296
01:11:17,967 --> 01:11:19,942
That's a reservation
for a Broadway show...

1297
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:22,575
on November the seventh.

1298
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,640
- Broadway show?
- Yeah, some revival of Grease.

1299
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:26,605
You know.

1300
01:11:26,672 --> 01:11:30,316
<i>We go together like shama lama lama</i>
Da dingity dingy dop

1301
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:33,349
This was my birthday present
to Henry.

1302
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,938
Don't.

1303
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:43,725
There's two hundred and fifty
down the drain, huh, Leslie?

1304
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:45,798
Excuse me,
do you have a cork screw?

1305
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:49,550
- Mr. Perkins?
- Don't answer that.

1306
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:51,623
Yeah, forty Sinatra Drive.

1307
01:11:53,327 --> 01:11:55,400
- Who was it?
- Mr. Brerfcurse is on his way.

1308
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:57,068
Brerfcurse?

1309
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:00,876
You smell lamb?

1310
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:03,016
- Fire! Fire!
- Oh my God! Fire!

1311
01:12:03,856 --> 01:12:05,710
- Fire! Fire!
- Take it out.

1312
01:12:05,807 --> 01:12:07,696
- Take water. Water, water!
- Fire! Fire!

1313
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:08,678
Fire! Fire!

1314
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,346
Tampering with evidence
is a felony.

1315
01:12:14,447 --> 01:12:16,236
Punishable by up to ten years
in prison.

1316
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:19,376
No, no, no, this is just my briefcase.
It's just my briefcase.

1317
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:23,216
It's just like yours. They just
look alike. That's all. Show to him.

1318
01:12:23,249 --> 01:12:25,933
- See, it's here.
- Same kind.

1319
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:28,042
Great minds think alike,
detective.

1320
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,815
I'd like that piece of paper back.

1321
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:34,604
The piece of paper?
Yes, indeed. It was right...

1322
01:12:35,663 --> 01:12:37,354
Here we are.

1323
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:45,069
Mr. Perkins,
as an officer of the law...

1324
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:48,877
I'm ordering you to come with me
to identify your brother's body!

1325
01:12:48,976 --> 01:12:52,009
What, are you insane?
I can't identify Henry's body.

1326
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:53,766
He was my twin.

1327
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:56,654
It would be like...
like looking at myself...

1328
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,542
dead on the slab.

1329
01:13:01,424 --> 01:13:04,293
I just need some member of the family
to come with me.

1330
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:10,958
- Not me!
- You will be well paid, Leslie.

1331
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:13,007
It's not unusual for one of the members
of the bereaved family...

1332
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,760
- to volunteer for the job.
- I never volunteer on principle.

1333
01:13:15,793 --> 01:13:17,744
You'll be well, well paid, Leslie.

1334
01:13:17,778 --> 01:13:19,653
No, there's no payment
involved in this.

1335
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,584
You know what I mean,
for transportation.

1336
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:23,471
Transportation?
He has to go across the river.

1337
01:13:23,505 --> 01:13:26,319
Yes, across the river and back.
Do you know how much the tolls are?

1338
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,358
Look, why don't you just let the family
take care of this?

1339
01:13:28,463 --> 01:13:30,351
- You finish making the coffee...
- I've made the coffee.

1340
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,967
- I've made the coffee twice.
- Sure it's cold by now.

1341
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:39,689
Cold as ice.

1342
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:41,772
Better make a new pot!

1343
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,523
- Okay, Leslie.
- No.

1344
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:46,565
- I'm not going.
- Leslie, let me handle this.

1345
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:49,355
I'm not going, Freddy.
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

1346
01:13:49,456 --> 01:13:51,463
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

1347
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,167
You don't know broke. I'm so broke
I got groceries only one way.

1348
01:13:59,824 --> 01:14:01,733
Don't worry,
they're making more.

1349
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,727
- I'm going down to that morgue, Henry!
- Vic, I'm begging you. Please.

1350
01:14:07,761 --> 01:14:10,542
- Not in a million years.
- There's cash, of course.

1351
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:12,462
- It's not a question of... how much?
- Ten thousand.

1352
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:13,356
- Thirty.
- Twenty.

1353
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:15,146
- Twenty-five.
- Done.

1354
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,094
It's amazing how fast it goes.

1355
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:20,207
So are you surprised
someone bumped Henry off?

1356
01:14:20,241 --> 01:14:22,924
No, man, not if all the stories
about Carol...

1357
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,901
doing Henry's twin brother,
Freddy, are true.

1358
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:26,830
You know something
is going on there.

1359
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:30,575
Hi, fellows.
Slater, Homicide.

1360
01:14:30,609 --> 01:14:33,445
I'm investigating
the whole Perkins murder.

1361
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,348
Sure, sure.

1362
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:36,334
You were saying that Mrs. Perkins
wasn't faithful?

1363
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,351
That woman was born
with her legs apart.

1364
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:41,068
When she dies, they'll going to put her
in a Y shaped coffin.

1365
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:44,201
- Well, did Mr. Perkins have any enemies?
- Everybody hated Henry and his brother.

1366
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:47,977
Women, children...
Everybody hated Henry Perkins.

1367
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:50,767
Hey, hey, off the record,
Henry and his twin brother Freddy...

1368
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,784
were selling drugs,
soliciting women...

1369
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:56,527
the wax fruit factory is actually
their cover for a white slavery ring.

1370
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:59,309
- Stan, come dance with me.
- Hey! I'll talk to you later.

1371
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,934
I'm on the road tonight.

1372
01:15:10,064 --> 01:15:12,715
Hey, welcome, welcome,
welcome to the show.

1373
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:14,885
Hey, pops, I think it's bedtime.

1374
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:18,736
What do you call a woman
who's paralyzed from the waist down?

1375
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:20,492
Married!

1376
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:22,348
Thanks.

1377
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,268
Carol? Carol?

1378
01:15:24,496 --> 01:15:27,179
We gotta skedaddle.
Mr. Big's on his way here.

1379
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,149
You'll never understand
the needs of an artist.

1380
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:33,093
There are no art critics coming tonight!
I hate to be the one to tell you that.

1381
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,709
But I do have a surprise for you,
that will make up for tonight...

1382
01:15:36,784 --> 01:15:38,726
and for all the promises
I've never kept.

1383
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:41,547
Because I love you
so much, Carol.

1384
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,309
Come on, guys!

1385
01:16:01,744 --> 01:16:03,631
- Don't let anybody in.
- Yeah, I'm...

1386
01:16:07,408 --> 01:16:08,527
Look at this piece of crap
somebody gave me.

1387
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:11,397
- That's our present.
- Well, it's the thought that counts.

1388
01:16:14,128 --> 01:16:15,143
Here it is.

1389
01:16:18,064 --> 01:16:20,846
- Put them in.
- I'd take my 25 g's now, Henry.

1390
01:16:20,911 --> 01:16:23,781
I'm surprised at you, Vic. You don't
take money for helping a friend.

1391
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,642
Yes, I do.

1392
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,653
And besides, we're not friends,
we're family.

1393
01:16:30,704 --> 01:16:32,427
Out again, boys.

1394
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:36,269
You know, it's a crime. It's a crime.
You don't let me in.

1395
01:16:39,184 --> 01:16:40,972
Give my hundred grand.

1396
01:16:41,104 --> 01:16:42,031
Come on, now!

1397
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:43,975
- It's a bargain.
- Yeah, it is a bargain.

1398
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:46,829
- Here we go.
- Give me the rest.

1399
01:16:47,824 --> 01:16:50,671
- Don't forget my money, Henry.
- You're squeezing him too?

1400
01:16:50,705 --> 01:16:52,711
No, I'm getting paid
for services rendered.

1401
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,247
Mr. Perkins?

1402
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,917
I can't seem to find the...
Oh my goodness!

1403
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,789
I guess he's caught the three of us
at it now, huh?

1404
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:13,613
This is not what it looks like.

1405
01:17:14,608 --> 01:17:19,397
Leslie's decided
to accompany you to the morgue.

1406
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:20,486
Good. Let's go, Leslie.

1407
01:17:20,591 --> 01:17:23,308
Yeah, I just need five minutes
to get ready.

1408
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:26,342
- Another five minutes?
- He's got his hands full at the moment.

1409
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:29,040
Fine. I'll wait for you
down in the car.

1410
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:29,988
Thank you.

1411
01:17:31,087 --> 01:17:32,102
Thanks a lot.

1412
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:33,863
Don't be like that.

1413
01:17:33,935 --> 01:17:34,950
I was just having a little fun.

1414
01:17:35,728 --> 01:17:38,597
Hey, fellows, serious...
stay close.

1415
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,309
What is a husband's idea
of foreplay?

1416
01:17:46,415 --> 01:17:48,303
A better power of begging.

1417
01:17:55,055 --> 01:17:57,925
Henry, I hate to bring this up,
but I'm a little five g's short.

1418
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:00,772
Alright.

1419
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:08,333
What the hell is this?

1420
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,246
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

1421
01:18:13,264 --> 01:18:14,158
I got it.

1422
01:18:14,255 --> 01:18:16,906
- Where's the money?
- Search me?

1423
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:18,830
- That's not a bad idea, Vic.
- Hey!

1424
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,862
You can insult my cheese wheel.
You can even steal my wife.

1425
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:23,791
But I draw the line
at being called a crook!

1426
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,547
Alright, I'm sorry about
your cheese wheel...

1427
01:18:25,615 --> 01:18:29,390
but I mean, seriously, where could
it be? I put it right down in here.

1428
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:32,357
He comes in there and...
He comes in...

1429
01:18:33,328 --> 01:18:34,310
- Slater.
- Slater.

1430
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,319
Then who's briefcase is this?

1431
01:18:51,631 --> 01:18:52,525
Kinky.

1432
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:54,415
And it's a front
for a white slavery ring.

1433
01:18:54,449 --> 01:18:55,440
Captain, I know you're starving...

1434
01:18:55,473 --> 01:18:59,084
but my instincts tell me
the murderer is here!

1435
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:18,438
Move it.

1436
01:19:20,304 --> 01:19:21,286
Yes!

1437
01:19:40,303 --> 01:19:41,286
Thank you.

1438
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:49,095
I know who you are.

1439
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,984
You're the cliché European bad guys
who shot him in the head...

1440
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:53,926
and dumped him in the river.

1441
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:56,711
No, too obvious,
good try though, huh?

1442
01:19:57,775 --> 01:20:00,492
Yeah, baby, get down.
Shake it. Yeah.

1443
01:20:03,535 --> 01:20:06,186
The blue has such a sensual feel.

1444
01:20:15,024 --> 01:20:15,917
There he is.

1445
01:20:17,008 --> 01:20:19,823
Okay, I'll distract him
while you'll switch cases.

1446
01:20:38,095 --> 01:20:39,851
Mr. Perkins, where's Leslie?

1447
01:20:39,952 --> 01:20:42,734
- He'll be down in about five minutes.
- Five minutes?

1448
01:20:43,663 --> 01:20:47,526
That's all I've been hearing all night.
If he's not down very, very soon...

1449
01:20:47,632 --> 01:20:49,541
I'm going to be forced
to make an arrest.

1450
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,339
Who are you gonna arrest?

1451
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:55,205
Well, when I do it's going to be
evident who that person is.

1452
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,069
I'm sorry.
Did I do that?

1453
01:21:00,175 --> 01:21:02,761
- Where's Leslie?
- He'll be down in five minutes.

1454
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:03,846
Five minutes.

1455
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:13,577
Hey, man, you spill my drink.

1456
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:24,071
It's the briefcase?

1457
01:21:24,975 --> 01:21:26,022
Excuse me.

1458
01:21:26,863 --> 01:21:27,812
Mr. Big.

1459
01:21:40,368 --> 01:21:43,117
What the hell is the difference?
Put it in the back seat.

1460
01:21:45,008 --> 01:21:47,113
- Mr. Feldman?
- Henry, hey!

1461
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:48,874
I'm so glad you're alive.

1462
01:21:48,975 --> 01:21:51,725
I won't be coming back to work.
I'm retiring early.

1463
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:52,871
- Henry, wait!
- Don't try and change my mind!

1464
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:55,786
This is not about you
and wax fruit.

1465
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:58,438
- It's about my wife.
- I really need you.

1466
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:01,446
Carol needs me more.
And you know what I realized tonight?

1467
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,424
- I need her.
- And I need some pants.

1468
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,117
Mr. Perkins!

1469
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:09,070
Your wife Carol...

1470
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:10,150
what a talent!

1471
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:12,912
I'd very much like to give her
a show at my gallery.

1472
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:14,736
- Really?
- Yes.

1473
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:16,711
And I think
this might belong to you.

1474
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:19,662
I have one just like it.
I must have picked yours by mistake.

1475
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,487
Sol, I have the feeling
you won't be needing those pants.

1476
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:31,111
Happy birthday, Henry.
We are out of here.

1477
01:22:31,215 --> 01:22:32,939
Come on, baby.

1478
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:37,674
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
Feldman's Wax Fruit presents...

1479
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:39,631
<i>Tom Jones!</i>

1480
01:22:39,759 --> 01:22:40,653
Come on!

1481
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:48,457
- Hey, have you seen Henry Perkins?
- Haven't you heard? Henry's dead.

1482
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,663
- Hi, Vic, how are you?
- Hey.

1483
01:23:03,697 --> 01:23:04,743
Henry? I got it!

1484
01:23:19,983 --> 01:23:23,082
Henry, this is the briefcase
with the money.

1485
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:28,589
- Vic, Henry, they're here!
- Where?

1486
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,532
Mr. Perkins!

1487
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:32,526
It's being over five minutes.

1488
01:23:36,495 --> 01:23:38,121
"Brerfcurse"!

1489
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,230
- What?
- What?

1490
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:47,758
Awesome, it's like seeing
some Tarantino movie.

1491
01:23:56,559 --> 01:23:59,243
<i>Happy birthday to</i>

1492
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,350
Brerfcurse!

1493
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:05,005
Looks like we'll all be going
to the morgue.

1494
01:24:09,103 --> 01:24:10,958
Make a wish, honey.

1495
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:12,879
Drop it!

1496
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,469
They're real bullets, everybody.

1497
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:22,282
Run!

1498
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:26,149
What the hell is going on?

1499
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:49,223
- Great party, Henry.
- Thanks.

1500
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,061
He's got a gun.

1501
01:24:56,016 --> 01:24:57,739
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

1502
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,887
I'm a cop!

1503
01:25:03,567 --> 01:25:04,647
I'm a cop!

1504
01:25:09,296 --> 01:25:10,408
Let's go!

1505
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:13,190
- Run!
- Hurry!

1506
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:18,054
Henry, I changed my mind.
I want to go to Barcelona.

1507
01:25:23,631 --> 01:25:24,809
It's not Barcelona, it's Greece.

1508
01:25:25,808 --> 01:25:27,466
Greece?

1509
01:25:27,632 --> 01:25:31,341
I always wanted to go to Greece.
It's my dream.

1510
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:36,074
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1511
01:25:41,007 --> 01:25:42,982
Let's get down
through the back stairs. Come on!

1512
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:48,743
My fish!

1513
01:26:04,016 --> 01:26:07,878
I need backup. Send help.
Send the Swat team, send anybody.

1514
01:26:44,303 --> 01:26:46,416
We're live at Hoboken, New Jersey,
where a violent shooting...

1515
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:48,205
has left three men dead.

1516
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:51,915
Vasile Zolton, suspected Romanian
crime syndicated boss...

1517
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:53,840
<i>was one of the three men</i>
found dead...

1518
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:55,749
<i>in the apartment</i>
of Henry and Carol Perkins.

1519
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:58,604
<i>Detective Dennis Slater</i>
is the officer who crack the case.

1520
01:26:58,703 --> 01:26:59,750
<i>Detective Slater,</i>
how did you do it?

1521
01:26:59,823 --> 01:27:01,711
<i>I cannot comment</i>
on the particulars of this case.

1522
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:03,440
Are you watching
what I'm watching?

1523
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:05,391
<i>On a personal note</i>
white slavery is wrong...

1524
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:07,366
<i>sex toys should be</i>
for adults only...

1525
01:27:07,503 --> 01:27:10,373
<i>and drugs kill as is evidenced</i>
by this ghastly occurrence.

1526
01:27:11,183 --> 01:27:14,925
Hey, listen, I spoke to the broke.
He said we give him cash.

1527
01:27:15,183 --> 01:27:16,939
What the hell is this?

1528
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,755
Perkins!

1529
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,589
<i>Perkins!</i>

1530
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:49,456
Henry, you're the man.

1531
01:27:49,489 --> 01:27:50,640
I told you, Vic.

1532
01:27:50,674 --> 01:27:53,327
Yeah, but, Carol, I'm sorry you missed
your flight to Greece.

1533
01:27:53,361 --> 01:27:55,407
Who needs Greece
when we're on Paradise?

1534
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:58,091
- Hey, can I see it, honey?
- Yeah, come on.

1535
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:00,070
"Voilà".

1536
01:28:00,176 --> 01:28:01,103
Carol!

1537
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:03,854
Lower your hand, honey.

1538
01:28:05,807 --> 01:28:06,887
Come on, baby.
