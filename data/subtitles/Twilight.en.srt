1
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:24,146
<i>I'd never given much thought</i>
<i>to how I would die.</i>

2
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:37,183
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love</i>
<i>seems like a good way to go.</i>

3
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:14,356
<i>So I can't bring myself to</i>
<i>regret the decision to leave home.</i>

4
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,549
<i>I would miss Phoenix.</i>

5
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>I'd miss the heat.</i>

6
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,817
<i>I would miss my loving, erratic,</i>
<i>harebrained mother.</i>

7
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,114
Okay.

8
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,043
Renee, come on.
<i>- And her new husband.</i>

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,882
Guys, come on. I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.

10
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:39,545
<i>But they want to go on the road,</i>
<i>so I'm gonna spend some time with my dad,</i>

11
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,248
<i>and this will be a good thing.</i>

12
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,118
<i>I think.</i>

13
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:48,920
<i> When the thorn bush turns white</i>

14
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:55,180
<i>That's when I'll come home</i>

15
00:01:55,253 --> 00:02:02,209
<i>I am going out to see what I can sow</i>

16
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:08,912
<i>And I don't know where I'll go</i>

17
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:12,282
<i>And I don't know what I'll see</i>

18
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:13,752
<i>In the state of Washington,</i>

19
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,787
<i>under a near constant cover</i>
<i>of clouds and rain,</i>

20
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,251
<i>there's a small town named Forks.</i>

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,479
<i>Population, 3, 120 people.</i>

22
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,977
<i>This is where I'm moving.</i>

23
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,848
<i>My dad's Charlie.</i>

24
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,780
<i>He's the chief of police.</i>

25
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,348
<i>Curse the powers that be</i>

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,185
<i>Cause all I want is...</i>

27
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,050
Your hair's longer.

28
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:50,450
I cut it since the last time I saw you.

29
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,018
Guess it grew out again.

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,044
<i>I used to spend two weeks here</i>
<i>almost every summer,</i>

31
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,618
<i>but it's been years.</i>

32
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,516
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.

33
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,812
Right. One bathroom.

34
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,283
It's a pretty good work lamp.

35
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:41,152
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.

36
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,742
You like purple, right?

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,411
Purple's cool.

38
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,550
Thanks.

39
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:55,149
Okay.

40
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:03,211
<i>One of the best things about Charlie,</i>

41
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,186
<i>he doesn't hover.</i>

42
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,516
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

43
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:16,177
Good to see you.

44
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,817
Bella, you remember Billy Black.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,184
Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.

46
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,113
I'm glad you're finally here.

47
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,483
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it
since you told him you were coming.

48
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,552
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

49
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,451
After I ram you in the ankles.

50
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,112
You want to go?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,415
Bring it.

52
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:40,420
Hi, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

53
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,249
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.

54
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,149
Right. No, I remember.

55
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,377
Are they always like this?

56
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,851
It's getting worse with old age.
- Good.

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,648
So, what do you think?

58
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,814
Of what?

59
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,786
Your homecoming present.
- This?

60
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:02,151
Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.

61
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:05,244
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
- Come on.

62
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,081
Oh, my gosh!

63
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,521
This is perfect. Are you joking me?

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,319
Sorry.

65
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,252
I told you she'd love it.

66
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,218
I'm down with the kids.

67
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:19,776
Oh, yeah, dude. You're the bomb.

68
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,184
Okay.

69
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,946
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

70
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,180
but besides that, you should be good.

71
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,483
That's this one?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.

72
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,076
All right.

73
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:32,877
Do you want a ride to school or something?

74
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:34,976
I go to school on the reservation.

75
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,413
Right, right.
- Yeah.

76
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,648
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,110
<i>My first day at a new school.</i>

78
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,518
<i>It's March, middle of the semester.</i>

79
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:53,980
<i>Great.</i>

80
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,346
Nice ride.
- Thanks.

81
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,216
Good one.

82
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,976
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.

83
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:18,418
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.

84
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:23,319
Anything you need, tour guide,
lunch date, shoulder to cry on?

85
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,821
I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

86
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:32,812
Good headline for your feature.

87
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,548
I'm on the paper,
and you're news, baby, front page.

88
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:37,052
No, I'm not.

89
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:41,218
You...
Please don't have any sort of...

90
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:43,480
Chillax. No feature.

91
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,418
Okay, thanks.
- Cool?

92
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,487
All right. Okay. Yeah.

93
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,279
Get it! Get it! Get it!

94
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,211
To you!

95
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:57,718
Whoa!

96
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:58,846
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,182
I told them not to let me play.

98
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,951
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

99
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,452
You're Isabella, right?

100
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,987
Just Bella.

101
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,213
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

102
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,646
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:14,983
She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

104
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:16,783
I'm Jessica, by the way.

105
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:18,786
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?

106
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,184
Yeah.

107
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:23,981
Aren't people from Arizona
supposed to be, like, really tan?

108
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,112
Yeah.

109
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,779
Maybe that's why they kicked me out.

110
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:32,754
You're good.

111
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,682
That's so funny.

112
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,112
Back in, Jess.
- Down here.

113
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,215
Like a masterpiece, you know,

114
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,550
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,

115
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,553
and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.

116
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,747
You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?

117
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,447
Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella?
- Hey.

118
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:53,848
Your home girl?

119
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:54,909
Yeah.
- Yeah?

120
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,817
That's...
- My girl.

121
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,687
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!

122
00:07:58,754 --> 00:07:59,742
Tyler.

123
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,148
Yes!

124
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,209
Oh, my God.

125
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:08,345
It's like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.

126
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,018
Smile.

127
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:11,649
Okay.
- Sorry.

128
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,119
I needed a candid for the feature.

129
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:14,586
The feature's dead, Angela.

130
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,711
Don't bring it up again.

131
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:18,112
It's okay, I just...

132
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,449
I got your back, baby.

133
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,716
Guess we'll just run another editorial
on teen drinking.

134
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:27,949
You know,
you can always go for eating disorders.

135
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,420
Speedo padding on the swim team.

136
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,044
Actually, that's a good one.

137
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,211
Kirk. Right? That's exactly what I thought.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,447
We're talking Olympic-size.

139
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,613
There's no way. He's so skinny.
It doesn't make sense.

140
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,347
Totally.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,376
Who are they?

142
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,544
The Cullens.

143
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,144
They're Dr. and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.

144
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,745
They moved down here from Alaska,
like, a few years ago.

145
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,947
They kind of keep to themselves.

146
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,953
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

147
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:03,044
Like, together, together.

148
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:08,278
The blonde girl, that's Rosalie,

149
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,947
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

150
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,486
I'm not even sure that's legal.

151
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,918
Jess, they're not actually related.

152
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,648
Yeah, but they live together. It's weird.

153
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,346
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's Alice.

154
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,320
She's really weird,

155
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:28,548
and she's with Jasper, the blond one
who looks like he's in pain.

156
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:37,316
Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad/matchmaker.

157
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,376
Maybe he'll adopt me.

158
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,988
Who's he?

159
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,051
That's Edward Cullen.

160
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,917
He's totally gorgeous, obviously,

161
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:56,318
but apparently nobody here's
good enough for him.

162
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,619
Like I care, you know?

163
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,552
So, yeah.

164
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:07,052
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

165
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:09,246
I wasn't planning on it.

166
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,254
Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.

167
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,683
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

168
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,585
Hi. Can I have the pass? Thank you.

169
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,985
Welcome to the class.
Here. Here's your stuff, okay?

170
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,715
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.

171
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:49,119
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.

172
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:53,280
All right, guys, today we are gonna be
<i>observing the behavior of planaria,</i>

173
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,413
aka flatworms.

174
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,414
So what we're gonna do...

175
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,144
...regenerate.

176
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,211
Zombie worms.

177
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,780
No cell phones. Guys, let's get to it.

178
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,615
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.

179
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:17,451
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

180
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,489
You won't believe this.

181
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:23,581
Let's try to focus
while we check those out, huh, guys?

182
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:35,851
There must be something open.

183
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,854
Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.

184
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,278
Just a minute, dear.

185
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:44,322
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology.

186
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:48,888
Fine. Just... I'll just have to endure it.

187
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:08,717
I just can't get over how grown up you are.
And so gorgeous.

188
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,312
Hey, Bella.

189
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,048
You remember me?

190
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,380
I played Santa one year.

191
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:19,615
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had
a Christmas here since she was four.

192
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,813
I bet I made an impression, though, didn't I?

193
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,412
You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?

194
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,977
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.

195
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:30,283
All right,
let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.

196
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,787
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.

197
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,684
Berry cobbler, remember?

198
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,687
Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.

199
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,879
Thank you. That'd be great.

200
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,918
Here.

201
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,615
Thanks.

202
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:59,317
<i>Hey, baby. So, listen,</i>
<i>if spring training goes well,</i>

203
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,548
<i>we could be moving to Florida.</i>

204
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,714
<i>Please insert $1.25</i>
<i>for an additional three minutes.</i>

205
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:04,981
Mom, where's your cell?

206
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:06,522
Okay, don't laugh.

207
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,076
I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away.

208
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:13,484
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.

209
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:17,644
I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

210
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:20,018
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?

211
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:22,145
<i>Are there any cute guys?</i>

212
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,051
<i>Are they being nice to you?</i>

213
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,549
Well,

214
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,048
they're all very welcoming.

215
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:32,288
Tell me all about it.

216
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,048
It doesn't even matter.

217
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,315
<i>Yes, it does, honey.</i>

218
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,514
I have homework to do. I'll talk to you later.

219
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:40,952
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

220
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,613
Love you, too.

221
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:56,049
<i>I planned to confront him</i>
<i>and demand to know what his problem was.</i>

222
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,919
<i>But he never showed.</i>

223
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,450
Bella!

224
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,588
<i>And the next day, another no-show.</i>

225
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,350
<i>More days passed.</i>

226
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,551
<i>Things were getting a little strange.</i>

227
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,812
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

228
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,720
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

229
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,448
Yeah. That's why I had
some new tires put on the truck.

230
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,283
Old ones were getting pretty bald.

231
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,345
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.

232
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:49,684
Security guard at the Grisham Mill
got killed by some kind of animal.

233
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:51,855
An animal?

234
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:55,748
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.

235
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,913
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

236
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,251
Be careful.
- Always am.

237
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,245
And thanks for the tires.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,355
Prom Committee is a chick thing,

239
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,322
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway,

240
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,150
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,

241
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:27,245
so I need your play list.

242
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:31,846
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

243
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,649
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

244
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,654
How you liking the rain, girl?

245
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:36,813
Better get used to it, girl.

246
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,650
Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.

247
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:41,883
Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.

248
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:44,251
Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.

249
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:47,049
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?

250
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,150
Hello.

251
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:02,913
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself last week.

252
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,922
I'm Edward Cullen.

253
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,478
You're Bella?

254
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:08,680
Yes.

255
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,483
Onion root tip cells,

256
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,284
that's what's on your slides right now.

257
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:16,549
Okay? So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,

258
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:21,577
and the first partners that get it right
are gonna win the Golden Onion.

259
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,282
All right, good.

260
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:28,979
Ladies first.

261
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,512
You were gone.

262
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,082
Yeah.

263
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,045
I was out of town for a couple of days.

264
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,917
Personal reasons.

265
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,447
Prophase.

266
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,588
Do you mind if I look?

267
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,314
It's prophase.

268
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:56,711
Like I said.

269
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,618
So are you enjoying the rain?

270
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:08,751
What?

271
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:11,118
You're asking me about the weather?

272
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,554
Yeah, I...

273
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,711
I guess I am.

274
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,021
Well, I don't really like the rain.

275
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:25,411
Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...

276
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,181
What?
- Nothing.

277
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,951
It's anaphase.

278
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,751
You mind if I check?
- Sure.

279
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,617
Anaphase.

280
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,779
Like I said.

281
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,685
If you hate the cold and the rain so much,

282
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:03,847
why'd you move to the wettest place
in the continental US?

283
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,352
It's complicated.

284
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,979
I'm sure I can keep up.

285
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,648
My mom remarried, and...

286
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:24,884
So you don't like the guy, or...

287
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,151
No, that's not...

288
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,618
Phil's really nice.

289
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,384
It's metaphase. You want to check it?

290
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,381
I believe you.

291
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:54,347
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

292
00:19:56,257 --> 00:20:00,154
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player,

293
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:03,121
and he travels a lot,

294
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,587
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,

295
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:11,145
so I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while.

296
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:15,248
And now you're unhappy.

297
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,048
No.
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

298
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,852
I'm just trying to figure you out.

299
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:24,355
You're very difficult for me to read.

300
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,652
Hey, did you get contacts?

301
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,053
No.

302
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,352
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

303
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:35,378
and now they're, like, golden brown.

304
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,615
Yeah, I know, it's the...

305
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:40,046
It's the fluorescents.

306
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,016
Bella!
- Bella!

307
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,211
Dial 911!

308
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:41,256
I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.

309
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,846
Bella, I'm so sorry. I panicked.

310
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,751
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.

311
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:55,819
Bella. You okay?

312
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:58,154
You and I are gonna talk. You all right?

313
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:00,019
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

314
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,521
I'm sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.

315
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,646
I know. It's okay.

316
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,155
No. It sure as hell is not okay.

317
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:07,648
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

318
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,780
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

319
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:12,016
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

320
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,784
You can kiss your license goodbye.

321
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,481
I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- Dr. Cullen.

322
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:19,921
Charlie.

323
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,381
I've got this one, Jackie.

324
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,786
Isabella.

325
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:26,577
Bella.

326
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,923
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

327
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,150
Good.

328
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,288
Look here.

329
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,314
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

330
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,288
but your vitals look good.

331
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:42,448
No signs of any head trauma.

332
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:44,047
I think you'll be just fine.

333
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:46,588
I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

334
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,948
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse

335
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:53,887
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

336
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,048
Edward? Your boy?

337
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,020
Yeah, it was amazing.

338
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,852
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

339
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,015
Sounds like you were very lucky.

340
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,386
Charlie.

341
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:11,616
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

342
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,755
You should probably call your mom.

343
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:16,449
Did you tell her?

344
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,189
She's probably just

345
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:23,982
freaking out.

346
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:26,621
fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

347
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:29,249
What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

348
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,017
This isn't just about you. It's about all of us.

349
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,885
I think we should
take this in my office.

350
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:39,890
Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.

351
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,355
What?

352
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:53,087
How did you get over to me so fast?

353
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:55,623
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

354
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:59,488
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

355
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,681
No, I wasn't.

356
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,851
Yes, you were.

357
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:10,753
Bella, you're... You hit your head.

358
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,585
I think you're confused.

359
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,088
I know what I saw.

360
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,282
And what exactly was that?

361
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,488
You...

362
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:22,155
You stopped the van.

363
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:25,417
You pushed it away with your hand.

364
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:29,085
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

365
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,550
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

366
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:35,654
I just need to know the truth.

367
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:39,487
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

368
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,413
Thank you.

369
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,585
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

370
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,624
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

371
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,680
<i>And that was the first night</i>
<i>I dreamt of Edward Cullen.</i>

372
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:30,750
I need everybody's permission slips, okay?

373
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:32,551
Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.

374
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,352
Guys, let's go.

375
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:37,356
Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

376
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,184
Look at you, huh? You're alive.

377
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:55,815
I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.

378
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,654
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

379
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,417
it's like a month away, but...

380
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:06,550
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

381
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:11,682
So, what do you think?

382
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:14,690
About what?
- Do you want to go?

383
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,123
To prom?

384
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:19,851
With me?

385
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,788
I...

386
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:24,619
Prom.

387
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,855
Dancing.

388
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:29,617
Not such a good idea for me.

389
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,688
I have something that weekend anyway.

390
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,690
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

391
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:37,723
You can't go another weekend?

392
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,690
Non-refundable ticket.

393
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,548
You should ask Jessica.

394
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,590
I know she wants to go with you.

395
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:46,419
All right. All right.

396
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,056
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, guys, come on.

397
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:53,249
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.

398
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:55,688
Let's go. Guys, come on.

399
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,917
Other bus, other bus. Let's go.

400
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,548
<i>Egg shells, carrot tops.</i>

401
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,250
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

402
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,813
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

403
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:10,256
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

404
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,682
Okay.
- Give me that.

405
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:15,655
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

406
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:18,349
Don't drink it! It's for the plants.

407
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:21,148
What's in Jacksonville?

408
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,217
How did you know about that?

409
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:28,551
You didn't answer my question.

410
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:31,553
You don't answer any of mine, so...

411
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,250
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

412
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:35,884
Hi.

413
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:40,148
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

414
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,122
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

415
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:46,249
It's very common. You can Google it.

416
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,884
Floridians.

417
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,252
That's what's in Jacksonville.

418
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,586
Can you at least watch where you walk?

419
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,353
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.

420
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:07,185
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.

421
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:08,952
Who?

422
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,480
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

423
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,718
It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

424
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,654
You guys are great together.
- I know, right?

425
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,690
Tyler...
- Gross.

426
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,848
Bella, look. It's a worm.

427
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:26,413
It's a worm.

428
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,823
Bella, we shouldn't be friends.

429
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:39,116
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

430
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,249
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me

431
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:43,789
and save yourself all this regret?

432
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,721
What, you think I regret saving you?

433
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,247
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

434
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,348
You don't know anything.

435
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:56,255
Hi.

436
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,784
Are you gonna be riding with us?

437
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,686
No, our bus is full.

438
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:11,846
Your mom called. Again.

439
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:14,813
Well, that's your fault.

440
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:17,517
You shouldn't have told her
about the "almost" accident. You finished?

441
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,921
Yeah.

442
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,580
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.

443
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:26,855
She seems different.

444
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:29,384
She seems happy.

445
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:35,247
Phil sounds like an all right guy.

446
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,314
Yeah, he is.

447
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,089
All right.

448
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,916
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

449
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,888
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

450
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,048
You're gonna get frostbite!
- I don't even know.

451
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,847
Yeah. Hey!

452
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,685
La Push, baby. You in?
- Should I know what that means?

453
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,280
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

454
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:08,551
Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.
- And I don't just surf the Internet.

455
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,886
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

456
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,321
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.

457
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:16,449
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

458
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:18,913
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?

459
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,548
Seriously, dude. It's creepy, man.

460
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,885
What? That's what it's called.
- So...

461
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,557
Edible art?

462
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:28,153
Bella.

463
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:30,688
Thanks.

464
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:34,555
You know, your mood swings
are kind of giving me whiplash.

465
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,714
I only said it'd be better
if we weren't friends,

466
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,223
not that I didn't wanna be.

467
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,121
What does that mean?

468
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:45,056
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

469
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:49,219
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

470
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:52,486
Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

471
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:55,954
I'd rather hear your theories.

472
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,181
I have considered

473
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,256
radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.

474
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:07,388
That's all superhero stuff, right?

475
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:10,855
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?

476
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,114
You're not.

477
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,923
I can see what you're trying to put off,

478
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:18,288
but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

479
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,914
It's a mask.

480
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,618
Why don't we just hang out?

481
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,554
Everybody's going to the beach.

482
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,022
Come.

483
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:37,680
I mean, have fun.

484
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,548
Which beach?
- La Push.

485
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:45,188
I don't know.

486
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,588
I just...

487
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,957
Is there something wrong with that beach?

488
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,583
It's just a little crowded.

489
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:03,017
Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.

490
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,915
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.

491
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,820
I'm at least paddling out.
- Yeah.

492
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,414
She's right.
- You guys are babies.

493
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:13,083
So, I keep thinking that Eric's
gonna ask me to the prom,

494
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:15,647
and then he just doesn't.

495
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,258
You should ask him.

496
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:24,452
Take control.
You're a strong, independent woman.

497
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:26,853
I am?
- Yes.

498
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,587
Hey, will you do me up?
- Yeah.

499
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:34,417
Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.

500
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,082
Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

501
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,557
Hi.
- Hi.

502
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,449
What are you, like, stalking me?

503
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,616
You're on my rez, remember?

504
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:46,082
Are you surfing?

505
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,355
Definitely not.
- Thanks.

506
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,324
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

507
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:52,449
What date?

508
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:54,355
She invited Edward.

509
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:56,948
To be polite, that's it.
- I think it's nice she invited him.

510
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,548
Nobody ever does.
- Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.

511
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,523
You got that right.

512
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:03,684
You guys know him?

513
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,019
The Cullens don't come here.

514
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,854
What did your friends mean about,
you know, "The Cullens don't come here?"

515
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,949
You caught that, huh?

516
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

517
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:28,415
Hey, I can keep a secret.

518
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,424
Really, it's just like an old scary story.

519
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,915
Well, I want to know.

520
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,055
Okay, did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

521
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:48,355
What? Like, wolves?

522
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:50,392
Yeah.
- Like, real wolves?

523
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:53,823
<i>Well, that's the legend of our tribe.</i>

524
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:55,048
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,886
So what's the story about the Cullens?

526
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:03,884
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like, enemy clan.

527
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,181
<i>My great grandfather, the chief,</i>
<i>found them hunting on our land.</i>

528
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,181
But they claimed to be something different,

529
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:16,521
<i>so we made a treaty with them.</i>

530
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:19,617
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands,

531
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:23,818
then we wouldn't expose
what they really were to the palefaces.

532
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:27,713
I thought they just moved here.

533
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:30,190
Or just moved back.

534
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,219
Right.

535
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:35,585
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

536
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,922
Well, what are they really?

537
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,083
It's just a story, Bella.

538
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,954
Come on, let's go.

539
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,748
A snake! A snake!

540
00:34:54,858 --> 00:35:00,951
<i>My mama said I didn't know</i>
<i>how to make a kitty meow</i>

541
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,454
Hello?

542
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,652
Gerald?

543
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,186
Gerald?

544
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:40,885
Hello.

545
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,282
Nice jacket.

546
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,483
Who are you?

547
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,456
It's always the same inane questions.

548
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:51,719
"Who are you?"

549
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,554
"What do you want?"

550
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,150
"Why are you doing this?"

551
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:59,885
James, let's not play with our food.

552
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,849
He's not here.

553
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:56,322
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

554
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:58,585
What, do they just ditch?

555
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:03,353
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out
for, like, hiking and camping and stuff.

556
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:05,619
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.

557
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,489
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.

558
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,253
I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.

559
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,791
Are you sure you have to go out of town?

560
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,416
Oh, yeah, it's a little family thing.

561
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,856
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles

562
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,858
before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

563
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:27,557
Port Angeles? You mind if I come?

564
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,956
Yeah, I need your opinion.

565
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:33,217
I like this one.
- That's cool.

566
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,623
But, like, I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

567
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,159
I like this one.
- Yeah, I like the beading,

568
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:39,521
and you wouldn't need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

569
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,490
Is that good? Is that my color?
- I like it.

570
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,548
I liked that dusty rose one, too.

571
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,592
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.

572
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:47,818
Hey.
- Right?

573
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,085
Nice.

574
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,420
Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.

575
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:54,454
That's disgusting.

576
00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:56,523
Bella, what do you think?

577
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:57,818
Yes?

578
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:00,021
That looks great.

579
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:03,059
You said that about, like,
the last five dresses, though.

580
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:05,353
I thought they were all pretty good.

581
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:07,949
You're not really into this, are you?

582
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:11,322
I actually really just want
to go to this bookstore.

583
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:13,181
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?

584
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,987
Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a minute.

585
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,617
Okay.
- Okay.

586
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:21,317
She's right, though. This looks awesome.

587
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:26,251
There you go.

588
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:30,021
Have a good night.
- Thank you.

589
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,856
Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?

590
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,085
There she is.

591
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,023
What's up?
- It's my girl.

592
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:10,753
How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.

593
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:13,690
What's up, girl? Hey... Where you going?

594
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,817
Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.

595
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:17,222
Yeah, you should hang out with us.
- Come on.

596
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:18,623
It's fun.

597
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,090
What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.

598
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,557
You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.

599
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,525
Cute.
- Really, no. Seriously, you should.

600
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,148
Don't touch me.

601
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,650
Get in the car.

602
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,952
That was a very dangerous maneuver.

603
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:08,351
I should go back there
and rip those guys' heads off.

604
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,449
No, you shouldn't.

605
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,391
You don't know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.

606
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,891
And you do?

607
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,650
It's not hard to guess.

608
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:22,190
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me so I won't turn around.

609
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,789
You should put your seatbelt on.

610
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,523
You should put your seatbelt on.

611
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,117
I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys, I'm sorry. I just...

612
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:38,715
Where were you? We left you messages.

613
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:42,226
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like,
starving, so we...

614
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,757
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

615
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:49,155
We just sort of ran into each other
and got talking.

616
00:40:50,592 --> 00:40:51,820
Yeah.
- No.

617
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:55,621
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

618
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:57,583
Yeah, we were...

619
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,523
We were, yeah, we were just leaving. So...
- Let's get this...

620
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,525
Bella, if you wanna...

621
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,985
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

622
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,583
If you'd like.

623
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,251
I'll drive you home myself.

624
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,690
That's so thoughtful.

625
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,224
It's really thoughtful. Yeah.

626
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,018
Yeah. I should eat something.

627
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:20,389
Yeah.

628
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:23,748
Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.

629
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:25,655
See ya.
- Okay.

630
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,925
All right, one mushroom ravioli.

631
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,157
Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

632
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:45,389
So are you sure there isn't anything
I can get for you?

633
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,358
No. No, thank you.

634
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:49,820
Let me know.

635
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:57,885
You're really not gonna eat?

636
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:02,686
No, I'm on a special diet.

637
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,324
You gotta give me some answers.

638
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,958
Yes, no.

639
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:13,125
To get to the other side.

640
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:15,659
1.77245...

641
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:18,056
I don't want to know
what the square root of pi is.

642
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:19,820
You knew that?

643
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:22,018
How did you know where I was?

644
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:23,355
I didn't.

645
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,452
All right.
- What?

646
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:28,186
Don't leave. I...

647
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,152
Did you follow me?

648
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:37,123
I...

649
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:41,626
I feel very protective of you.

650
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:45,822
So you followed me.

651
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:48,882
I was trying to keep a distance
unless you needed my help,

652
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,188
and then I heard what those low-lifes
were thinking.

653
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,590
Wait.

654
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:58,159
You say you heard what they were thinking?

655
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,887
So what, you...

656
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:05,755
You read minds?

657
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:12,286
I can read every mind in this room.

658
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,222
Apart from yours.

659
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:20,786
There's money, sex,

660
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,726
money,

661
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,916
sex,

662
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,255
cat.

663
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:33,056
And then you, nothing.

664
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:37,018
It's very frustrating.

665
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:41,891
Is there something wrong with me?

666
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:45,487
See, I tell you I can read minds,

667
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,617
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

668
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:57,751
What is it?

669
00:43:58,293 --> 00:44:05,090
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

670
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:09,059
Then don't.

671
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:31,418
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.

672
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,882
Your hand is so cold.

673
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:51,817
Whoa!

674
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:53,757
What is going on?

675
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,260
My dad's still here.

676
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,315
Can you pull in?

677
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:04,159
That's my father's car on the end.

678
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:06,617
What is he doing here?

679
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,519
Carlisle, what's going on?

680
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:16,492
Waylon Forge was found in a boat
out near his place.

681
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:19,918
I just examined the body.
- He died?

682
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,724
How?
- Animal attack.

683
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:29,320
Was it the same one that
got that security guard down in Mason?

684
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,655
Most likely.

685
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,557
Well, it's getting closer to town, then.
- Bella, you should go inside.

686
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:37,115
Waylon was your father's friend.

687
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,387
Okay.

688
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:43,923
I'll see you later.

689
00:45:55,994 --> 00:45:57,824
Hey.
- Hey.

690
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:03,592
Dad, I'm really sorry.

691
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:10,719
I've known him going on 30 years.

692
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:28,625
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.

693
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,291
Meantime,

694
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:34,992
I want you to carry this with you.

695
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,588
I don't know if you...
- It'll give your old man some peace of mind.

696
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:42,922
Okay.

697
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:47,853
Let's go home.

698
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:34,791
Cold One.

699
00:49:41,894 --> 00:49:44,690
You're impossibly fast and strong.

700
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:48,925
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.

701
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:51,827
Your eyes change color.

702
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,056
And sometimes you speak
like you're from a different time.

703
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:02,820
You never eat or drink anything.
You don't go out in the sunlight.

704
00:50:05,994 --> 00:50:07,688
How old are you?

705
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:10,550
Seventeen.

706
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:14,920
How long have you been 17?

707
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:19,791
A while.

708
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:34,690
I know what you are.

709
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,594
Say it.

710
00:50:42,094 --> 00:50:43,492
Out loud.

711
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:47,724
Say it.

712
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:54,956
Vampire.

713
00:50:58,394 --> 00:50:59,985
Are you afraid?

714
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:09,251
No.

715
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,827
Then ask me the most basic question.

716
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:16,588
What do we eat?

717
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,324
You won't hurt me.

718
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:28,090
Where are we going?

719
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,454
Up the mountain.

720
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:32,494
Out of the cloud bank.

721
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:35,722
You need to see what
I look like in the sunlight.

722
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:57,385
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

723
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,927
People would know we're different.

724
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,856
This is what I am.

725
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:19,226
It's like diamonds.

726
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:29,489
You're beautiful.

727
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,217
Beautiful?

728
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:36,920
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

729
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:44,952
I'm a killer.

730
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:48,960
I don't believe that.

731
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,219
That's because you believe the lie.

732
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:54,454
It's camouflage.

733
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:59,626
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

734
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,588
Everything about me invites you in,

735
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:07,492
my voice, my face, even my smell.

736
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,083
As if I would need any of that.

737
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:15,954
As if you could outrun me!

738
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:23,958
As if you could fight me off.

739
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:29,293
I'm designed to kill.

740
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:33,887
I don't care.

741
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,853
I've killed people before.

742
00:53:38,628 --> 00:53:40,423
It does not matter.

743
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,958
I wanted to kill you.

744
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:54,862
I've never wanted a human's blood
so much in my life.

745
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:57,650
I trust you.

746
00:54:00,163 --> 00:54:01,458
Don't.

747
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:04,728
I'm here. I trust you.

748
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:12,523
My family,
we're different from others of our kind.

749
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:14,356
We only hunt animals.

750
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:17,054
We've learned to control our thirst.

751
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:20,489
But it's you, your scent,

752
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:25,224
it's like a drug to me.

753
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:30,458
You're like
my own personal brand of heroin.

754
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:40,655
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

755
00:54:40,728 --> 00:54:42,195
I did.

756
00:54:42,494 --> 00:54:45,222
Only for making me want you so badly.

757
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:48,795
I still don't know if I can control myself.

758
00:54:50,762 --> 00:54:52,420
I know you can.

759
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:02,885
I can't read your mind.

760
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,527
You have to tell me what you're thinking.

761
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:10,688
Now I'm afraid.

762
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:17,025
Good.

763
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:20,094
I'm not afraid of you.

764
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:27,920
I'm only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.

765
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:38,018
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

766
00:55:46,228 --> 00:55:49,059
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.

767
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:54,492
What a stupid lamb.

768
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:57,153
What a sick, masochistic lion.

769
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:25,753
<i>About three things</i>
<i>I was absolutely positive.</i>

770
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:28,288
<i>First,</i>

771
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,425
<i>Edward was a vampire.</i>

772
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:37,257
<i>Second,</i>

773
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:39,994
<i>there was a part of him,</i>

774
00:57:40,063 --> 00:57:42,188
<i>and I didn't know</i>
<i>how dominant that part might be,</i>

775
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:45,889
<i>that thirsted for my blood.</i>

776
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:51,318
<i>And third,</i>

777
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:56,192
<i>I was unconditionally and irrevocably</i>
<i>in love with him.</i>

778
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:04,920
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

779
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:09,690
Gambling, tuxedos, and Bond, James Bond.

780
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,596
Oh, my God.

781
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:25,655
Wow.

782
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:30,159
You know, everybody's staring.

783
00:58:34,096 --> 00:58:37,460
Not that guy. No, he just looked.

784
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:42,692
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

785
00:58:42,762 --> 00:58:44,887
Since I'm going to hell.

786
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:52,090
So, does a person have to be dying

787
00:58:54,663 --> 00:58:56,561
to become like you?

788
00:58:57,128 --> 00:59:00,094
No, that's just Carlisle.

789
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,117
He'd never do this to someone
who had another choice.

790
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:09,389
So, how long have you been like this?

791
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:11,885
Since 1918.

792
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,456
<i>That's when Carlisle found me</i>
<i>dying of Spanish influenza.</i>

793
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,755
<i>What was it like?</i>

794
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:23,293
<i>The venom was excruciating.</i>

795
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:26,155
<i>But what Carlisle did was much harder.</i>

796
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,695
<i>Not many of us have the restraint to do that.</i>

797
00:59:28,762 --> 00:59:31,422
But didn't he just have to bite?

798
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:35,128
Not exactly.

799
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,458
When we taste

800
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:43,028
human blood, a sort of frenzy begins,

801
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,018
and it's almost impossible to stop.

802
00:59:49,228 --> 00:59:50,956
<i>But Carlisle did.</i>

803
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,860
<i>First with me</i>
<i>and then with his wife, Esme.</i>

804
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:58,452
So is Carlisle the real reason
that you don't kill people?

805
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,391
No, he's not the only reason.

806
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:09,623
I don't want to be a monster.

807
01:00:11,262 --> 01:00:15,389
My family,
we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right,

808
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:18,793
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.

809
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,327
But it's...

810
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,856
It's like a human only living on tofu.

811
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:28,452
It keeps you strong,
but you're never fully satisfied.

812
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:34,996
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood,
for instance.

813
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:43,452
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

814
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,791
Yeah.

815
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:49,125
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.

816
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:55,028
Can the rest of your family
read people's minds like you can?

817
01:00:58,097 --> 01:00:59,960
No. That's just me.

818
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,559
But Alice can see the future.

819
01:01:04,596 --> 01:01:06,585
I bet she saw me coming.

820
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:10,360
Alice's visions are subjective.

821
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:13,592
I mean, the future can always change.

822
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:26,757
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.

823
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:29,693
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

824
01:01:31,164 --> 01:01:32,561
Thanks.

825
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,961
Wait, like, with your family?
- Yeah.

826
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:39,422
What if they don't like me?

827
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:43,887
So, you're worried not because
you'll be in a house full of vampires,

828
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:47,088
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

829
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:49,295
I'm glad I amuse you.

830
01:01:50,862 --> 01:01:52,420
What is it?

831
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,320
Complication.

832
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,454
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

833
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:28,096
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

834
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:31,695
Looks good. Got that dent out.

835
01:02:31,762 --> 01:02:34,389
Yeah.
- Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

836
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,690
First Mariners game of the season.

837
01:02:36,762 --> 01:02:40,490
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about
seeing you again.

838
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:42,496
Great, Dad. Thanks.

839
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:44,755
Just keeping it real, son.

840
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,891
Vitamin R.

841
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:49,690
Well done, Chief.

842
01:02:49,762 --> 01:02:52,161
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

843
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,717
Good man.

844
01:02:56,097 --> 01:02:57,891
Any luck with that Waylon case?

845
01:02:57,963 --> 01:03:00,757
Well, I don't think it was an animal
that killed him.

846
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:02,887
Never thought it was.

847
01:03:04,396 --> 01:03:06,123
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?

848
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:07,753
Keep the kids out of the woods.

849
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,126
Will do.

850
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:12,896
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

851
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,757
Whoa.

852
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:48,625
This is incredible.

853
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:54,389
It's so light and open, you know?

854
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:00,018
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?

855
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,927
No, not the moats.

856
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:05,556
Not the moats.

857
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,230
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

858
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:19,592
I told them not to do this.

859
01:04:19,664 --> 01:04:23,322
<i>You add a little bit of olive oil</i>
<i>to a non-stick sauté pan,</i>

860
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:26,795
<i>and you want to cook</i>
<i>with the olive oil in medium-high heat.</i>

861
01:04:26,862 --> 01:04:30,626
<i>What I do, I cut this in strips,</i>
<i>and then we gonna cut this...</i>

862
01:04:30,697 --> 01:04:33,822
Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.

863
01:04:33,896 --> 01:04:36,862
I'm sure she'll love it, no matter what.

864
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:38,726
Get a whiff of that.

865
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:41,422
Here comes the human.

866
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,922
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.

867
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:53,530
Bella, this is Esme.
My mother for all intents and purposes.

868
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,525
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time.

869
01:04:58,597 --> 01:04:59,755
I hope you're hungry.

870
01:04:59,831 --> 01:05:02,456
Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.

871
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:10,193
Perfect.

872
01:05:10,764 --> 01:05:14,753
Yeah, it's just because
I know that you guys don't eat...

873
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:17,318
Of course. It's very considerate of you.

874
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,954
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.
- Yeah.

875
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:23,190
Let's just keep pretending
like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

876
01:05:23,264 --> 01:05:26,822
I would never tell anybody anything.

877
01:05:27,496 --> 01:05:29,257
She knows that.

878
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:32,420
Yeah, well, the problem is,
you two have gone public now, so...

879
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,485
Emmett.

880
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,257
No, she should know.

881
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:39,023
The entire family
will be implicated if this ends badly.

882
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,224
Badly, as in...

883
01:05:42,831 --> 01:05:45,193
I would become the meal.

884
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:53,961
Hi, Bella.

885
01:05:57,764 --> 01:05:59,251
I'm Alice.

886
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:01,492
Hi.
- Hi.

887
01:06:03,364 --> 01:06:05,262
You do smell good.

888
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:06,489
Alice, what are you...

889
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:10,018
It's okay.
Bella and I are gonna be great friends.

890
01:06:13,364 --> 01:06:15,829
Sorry,
Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

891
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:17,989
It's a little difficult for him.

892
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:19,963
It's a pleasure to meet you.

893
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,826
It's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.

894
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:27,922
All right, I'm gonna take you
on a tour of the rest of the house.

895
01:06:27,998 --> 01:06:30,293
Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.

896
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:31,590
Okay.

897
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:35,121
Cute!
- I know.

898
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:36,925
I think that went well.

899
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:39,394
Clean this up. Now.

900
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:42,588
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

901
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,458
I don't know.

902
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:51,789
Graduation caps?

903
01:06:52,963 --> 01:06:55,793
Yeah. It's a private joke.

904
01:06:56,697 --> 01:06:58,630
We matriculate a lot.

905
01:07:00,164 --> 01:07:02,063
That's kind of miserable.

906
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,994
I mean, repeating high school
over and over.

907
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:07,155
True, but the younger we start out
in a new place,

908
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,355
the longer we can stay there.

909
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:10,954
Come on.

910
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:23,096
Yeah, this is my room.

911
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,295
No bed?

912
01:07:37,864 --> 01:07:39,420
No, I don't...

913
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:41,753
I don't sleep.

914
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,927
Ever?
- No, not at all.

915
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,425
Okay.

916
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:00,126
Boy, you have so much music.

917
01:08:00,898 --> 01:08:03,090
What are you listening to?

918
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:08,086
It's Debussy.

919
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:12,461
I don't know...
- Yeah.

920
01:08:16,265 --> 01:08:18,560
<i>Claire De Lune is great.</i>

921
01:08:53,164 --> 01:08:55,858
What?
- I can't dance.

922
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,458
Well, I could always make you.

923
01:09:09,764 --> 01:09:11,729
I'm not scared of you.

924
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:18,063
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.

925
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:25,296
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

926
01:09:30,398 --> 01:09:32,125
Do you trust me?

927
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:34,220
In theory.

928
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:36,762
Then close your eyes.

929
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,525
What?

930
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,524
This isn't real.

931
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:08,756
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

932
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:10,592
It does in my world.

933
01:11:40,431 --> 01:11:41,921
Hold up.

934
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:48,654
It's human.

935
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:55,596
Arizona. Yo, what's happening?

936
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:58,154
So you and Cullen, huh?

937
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,697
That's... I don't like it.

938
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,157
I mean, I don't know,

939
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:06,493
he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.

940
01:12:09,097 --> 01:12:11,621
Here's your veggie plate, Stephenie.

941
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:14,722
Hey, sorry I'm late. Biology project.

942
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,729
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope that's okay.

943
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,822
You should order one for yourself next time.

944
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:22,921
Cut back on the steak.

945
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:25,560
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

946
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:29,055
Say, Chief, boys want to know,

947
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:33,829
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

948
01:12:36,497 --> 01:12:38,963
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint,

949
01:12:39,032 --> 01:12:41,395
but it looks like whoever that is,
is headed east,

950
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:44,225
so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take
over from here.

951
01:12:44,297 --> 01:12:45,957
Okay.
- Okay?

952
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,395
I just hope they catch him fast.

953
01:12:57,698 --> 01:13:00,529
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

954
01:13:02,331 --> 01:13:04,059
It's okay if you wanna go join them.

955
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:06,791
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.

956
01:13:06,864 --> 01:13:08,228
Me, too.

957
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,787
Bella, it's Friday night. Go out.

958
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:14,264
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

959
01:13:14,331 --> 01:13:16,387
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

960
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:19,560
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?

961
01:13:19,631 --> 01:13:21,654
Anybody interest you?

962
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:25,426
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?

963
01:13:26,765 --> 01:13:28,423
Yeah, I guess not.

964
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:32,597
I just feel like I leave you alone too much.

965
01:13:32,864 --> 01:13:35,057
You should be around people.

966
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:38,662
I don't really mind being alone.

967
01:13:39,265 --> 01:13:42,322
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.

968
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:49,457
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

969
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:52,095
Phil's working so hard.

970
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,631
You know, spring training.

971
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:57,664
We're looking for a house to rent
in case things become more permanent.

972
01:13:57,731 --> 01:13:59,061
<i>You'd like Jacksonville, baby.</i>

973
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:00,256
Yeah?

974
01:14:00,698 --> 01:14:02,664
I'm really liking Forks.

975
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:03,925
What?

976
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:07,493
Forks is growing on me.

977
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:10,429
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

978
01:14:10,497 --> 01:14:12,622
Well, yeah.

979
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,729
I knew it. Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

980
01:14:16,798 --> 01:14:19,095
<i>I bet he's smart. Is he smart?</i>

981
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,461
Mom, can I talk to you later?

982
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:26,657
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

983
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:34,226
How did you get in here?

984
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:35,820
The window.

985
01:14:36,298 --> 01:14:38,162
Do you do that a lot?

986
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,824
Well, just the past couple of months.

987
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,890
I like watching you sleep.

988
01:14:50,497 --> 01:14:53,020
It's kind of fascinating to me.

989
01:14:57,597 --> 01:14:59,894
I always want to try one thing.

990
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:02,994
Just stay very still.

991
01:15:10,099 --> 01:15:11,587
Don't move.

992
01:15:55,498 --> 01:15:57,158
Stop it!

993
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:01,020
I'm sorry.

994
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:06,024
I'm stronger than I thought.

995
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:09,121
Yeah. I wish I could say the same.

996
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:16,489
I can't ever lose control with you.

997
01:16:22,798 --> 01:16:24,458
Hey, don't go.

998
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:14,757
Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.

999
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:17,297
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

1000
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:22,055
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

1001
01:17:22,533 --> 01:17:23,623
No.

1002
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:26,460
He's a junior. I'm a junior.

1003
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:29,563
I thought you liked the Cullens.

1004
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:32,559
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

1005
01:17:32,632 --> 01:17:34,859
Edward doesn't live in town.

1006
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:37,020
Technically.

1007
01:17:39,765 --> 01:17:41,560
He's right outside.

1008
01:17:41,965 --> 01:17:43,396
He is?

1009
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:46,431
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.

1010
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:50,961
All right. Bring him in.

1011
01:17:52,998 --> 01:17:54,693
Could you be nice?

1012
01:17:55,832 --> 01:17:57,492
He's important.

1013
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:10,588
Chief Swan.

1014
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,029
I want to formally introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

1015
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:15,564
Hi, Edward.

1016
01:18:16,432 --> 01:18:17,694
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

1017
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:20,128
She's just gonna play baseball
with my family.

1018
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:21,186
Baseball?

1019
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:23,163
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

1020
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,425
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1021
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:28,259
Well, good luck with that.

1022
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:31,127
I'll take good care of her. I promise.

1023
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:35,496
Hey.

1024
01:18:36,498 --> 01:18:38,430
Still got that pepper spray?

1025
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:39,930
Yeah, Dad.

1026
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,894
And since when do vampires like baseball?

1027
01:18:47,966 --> 01:18:50,693
Well, it's the American pastime,

1028
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:53,323
and there's a thunderstorm coming.

1029
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:55,990
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.

1030
01:19:09,365 --> 01:19:10,389
Hey.

1031
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:12,454
Glad you're here. We need an umpire.

1032
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:14,055
She thinks we cheat.

1033
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:15,792
I know you cheat.

1034
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:20,530
Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.

1035
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,588
It's time.

1036
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,765
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.

1037
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:49,960
That's gotta be a home run, right?

1038
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:51,895
Edward's very fast.

1039
01:19:52,699 --> 01:19:56,631
<i> Ooh, baby,</i>
<i>don't you know I suffer?</i>

1040
01:19:56,699 --> 01:20:00,132
<i>Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you</i>

1041
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:01,994
Come home, Rosalie!

1042
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,761
You're out.
- Out!

1043
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:10,296
Babe, come on. It's just a game.

1044
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:16,063
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1045
01:20:16,132 --> 01:20:17,597
Nice kitty.

1046
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:20,859
<i>Ooh</i>

1047
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:24,127
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1048
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:28,894
<i>Ooh</i>

1049
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:32,056
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1050
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:36,724
<i>Ooh</i>

1051
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,163
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1052
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,390
What are you doing?

1053
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:46,087
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1054
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:50,122
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1055
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:54,029
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1056
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,827
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1057
01:20:57,899 --> 01:20:59,524
My monkey man.

1058
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,396
Stop!

1059
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:34,394
They were leaving. Then they heard us.

1060
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:36,556
Let's go.
- It's too late.

1061
01:21:37,966 --> 01:21:39,761
Get your hair down.

1062
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,591
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.

1063
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:52,599
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

1064
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:56,429
What? What are you...
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.

1065
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,154
I believe this belongs to you.

1066
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,224
Thank you.

1067
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,890
I am Laurent.

1068
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,289
And this is Victoria

1069
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:31,359
and James.

1070
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:34,688
I'm Carlisle. This is my family.

1071
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:37,793
Hello.

1072
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:41,695
I'm afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us.

1073
01:22:41,765 --> 01:22:43,595
Our apologies.

1074
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,359
We didn't realize the territory
had been claimed.

1075
01:22:46,434 --> 01:22:49,921
Yes, well, we maintain
a permanent residence nearby.

1076
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:52,960
Really?

1077
01:22:54,966 --> 01:22:58,056
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1078
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,931
We were just passing through.

1079
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,829
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1080
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:05,695
You should be safe.

1081
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:07,858
Excellent.

1082
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,759
So,

1083
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:12,698
could you use three more players?

1084
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:16,694
Come on. Just one game.

1085
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:19,532
Sure. Why not?

1086
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,064
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1087
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:23,792
We'll bat first.

1088
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:27,029
I'm the one with the wicked curveball.

1089
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,532
Well, I think we can handle that.

1090
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,488
We shall see.

1091
01:23:52,701 --> 01:23:54,667
You brought a snack.

1092
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:58,462
A human?

1093
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:03,662
The girl is with us.

1094
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:06,063
I think it best if you leave.

1095
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:11,689
I can see the game is over.

1096
01:24:11,766 --> 01:24:13,288
We'll go now.

1097
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:17,930
James.

1098
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:32,192
Get Bella out of here.

1099
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:33,528
Go.

1100
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:46,791
Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm all right!

1101
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:50,899
What, now he's coming after me?

1102
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:03,564
Listen to me. James is a tracker.
The hunt is his obsession.

1103
01:25:03,634 --> 01:25:06,532
I read his mind.
My reaction on the field set him off.

1104
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,930
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1105
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,556
He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?

1106
01:25:11,634 --> 01:25:15,395
We have to kill him.
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1107
01:25:15,466 --> 01:25:17,159
Where we going?
- Away from Forks.

1108
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:20,131
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
- I have to go home. Now.

1109
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:23,597
You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.

1110
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:26,599
He's just gonna trace your scent there.
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1111
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,724
But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter!

1112
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:32,063
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!

1113
01:25:33,033 --> 01:25:34,896
Just let me get you out of here first,
all right?

1114
01:25:34,966 --> 01:25:37,694
It's my dad! We have to go back!

1115
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,528
We'll figure a way
to lead the tracker away somehow.

1116
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,463
I don't know. But we have to do something.

1117
01:25:47,466 --> 01:25:50,127
Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella, don't do this, please.

1118
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:51,756
It's over! Get out!

1119
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:53,355
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1120
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:55,490
Bella? What's going on?

1121
01:25:56,199 --> 01:25:59,291
I just gotta get out of here. I'm leaving now.

1122
01:26:01,233 --> 01:26:02,426
Hey.

1123
01:26:05,434 --> 01:26:06,764
Bella?

1124
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,689
What am I gonna say to him?

1125
01:26:09,766 --> 01:26:11,460
I can't hurt him.

1126
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,765
Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.

1127
01:26:15,434 --> 01:26:17,457
I'll be down at the truck.

1128
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:24,528
Did he hurt you?

1129
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,430
No.

1130
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,862
Break up with you or something?

1131
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:32,990
No, I broke up with him.

1132
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,524
I thought you liked him.

1133
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:41,832
Yeah, that's why I have to leave.

1134
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,594
I don't want this. I have to go home.

1135
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:47,832
Home? Your...

1136
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,332
Your mom's not even in Phoenix.

1137
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:52,060
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1138
01:26:52,134 --> 01:26:54,429
You're not gonna drive home right now.

1139
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,796
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,

1140
01:26:57,867 --> 01:27:00,492
I'll take you to the airport.
- No. I want to drive.

1141
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:02,430
It'll give me more time to think.

1142
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,331
I mean, if I get really tired,
I'll pull into a motel. I promise.

1143
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:08,365
Look, Bella, I know I'm not
that much fun to be around,

1144
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:12,729
but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.

1145
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:17,331
Like what?

1146
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,127
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?

1147
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:22,962
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?

1148
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:25,430
Dad, that's you. That's not me.

1149
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:30,594
Bella, come on, I just...

1150
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:32,962
I just got you back.

1151
01:27:35,634 --> 01:27:37,792
Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now,

1152
01:27:37,867 --> 01:27:40,957
then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.

1153
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:07,596
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1154
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:11,296
Why don't you let me drive?

1155
01:28:16,966 --> 01:28:18,399
He won't.

1156
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:21,658
You should've seen his face.

1157
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:25,229
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him

1158
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:26,926
when she was leaving him.

1159
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,591
It's the only way he'd let you go.

1160
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:36,698
Just don't worry about him now.
He's safe. The tracker's following us.

1161
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:41,659
Oh, God.
- It's just Emmett.

1162
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:46,131
Alice is in the car behind us.

1163
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:08,993
Wait.

1164
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:12,466
He came to warn us about James.

1165
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:16,823
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,

1166
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,832
but he's got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1167
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,890
I've never seen anything like him
in my 300 years.

1168
01:29:22,966 --> 01:29:26,831
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1169
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:32,993
I've had to fight our kind before.

1170
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:36,091
They're not easy to kill.
- But not impossible.

1171
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,591
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.

1172
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:40,565
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1173
01:29:40,635 --> 01:29:43,157
even a sadistic one like James.

1174
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:46,529
What if he kills one of us first?
- I'm gonna run Bella south.

1175
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,759
Can you lead the tracker away from here?

1176
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,765
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.

1177
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,856
He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.

1178
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:54,024
Jasper and I will drive her south.

1179
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,430
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1180
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:58,626
Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.

1181
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,332
Rosalie, Esme,

1182
01:30:05,368 --> 01:30:09,425
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1183
01:30:11,702 --> 01:30:14,064
Why? What is she to me?

1184
01:30:14,134 --> 01:30:16,997
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.

1185
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:19,431
She's part of this family now,

1186
01:30:20,801 --> 01:30:23,096
and we protect our family.

1187
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,560
Oh, God. If anything...

1188
01:30:42,635 --> 01:30:43,862
What if...

1189
01:30:43,934 --> 01:30:45,729
If anything happens, I swear to God...

1190
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:47,768
Nothing's gonna happen.

1191
01:30:47,835 --> 01:30:50,528
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1192
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,260
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1193
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,493
Yeah.

1194
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:58,359
Bella, you are my life now.

1195
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:17,796
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1196
01:31:17,868 --> 01:31:19,800
You must have let your phone die
or something.

1197
01:31:19,868 --> 01:31:24,027
I'm not in Forks, but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1198
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:33,323
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1199
01:31:35,501 --> 01:31:37,296
That's good.

1200
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:26,161
What is it? What do you see?

1201
01:32:38,234 --> 01:32:39,791
He's figured it out.

1202
01:32:39,868 --> 01:32:42,662
The tracker, he just changed course.

1203
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:46,127
Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.

1204
01:32:46,202 --> 01:32:48,190
A room full of mirrors.

1205
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:55,559
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1206
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:57,930
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1207
01:32:58,002 --> 01:33:00,092
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1208
01:33:00,168 --> 01:33:02,395
Okay, so the course that
the tracker's on now

1209
01:33:02,467 --> 01:33:05,060
is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?

1210
01:33:05,868 --> 01:33:08,856
You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.

1211
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,530
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1212
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,828
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1213
01:33:12,902 --> 01:33:14,162
Yeah.

1214
01:33:15,902 --> 01:33:17,800
Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.

1215
01:33:17,868 --> 01:33:19,423
The woman's still in the area.

1216
01:33:19,501 --> 01:33:22,092
Rosalie and Esme are going back
to Forks to protect your father.

1217
01:33:22,168 --> 01:33:28,123
I'm coming to get you. Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1218
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:29,860
<i>And the others will keep hunting.</i>

1219
01:33:29,935 --> 01:33:33,128
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1220
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:47,197
Hey, Mom, I'm glad you got my message.

1221
01:33:47,269 --> 01:33:48,461
What are you doing home?

1222
01:33:48,534 --> 01:33:51,161
<i>Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?</i>

1223
01:33:52,135 --> 01:33:55,100
Calm down, everything's fine.
<i>- Bella? Bella?</i>

1224
01:33:55,168 --> 01:33:57,600
I'll explain everything later.

1225
01:33:57,702 --> 01:33:58,725
Mom, are you there?

1226
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:02,859
<i>Forks High School doesn't protect</i>
<i>its students' privacy very well.</i>

1227
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:07,230
It was just too easy for Victoria
to find your previous address.

1228
01:34:07,301 --> 01:34:09,733
<i>It's a nice house you have here.</i>

1229
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:12,064
<i>I was prepared to wait for you,</i>

1230
01:34:12,135 --> 01:34:16,760
<i>but then Mom came home after she received</i>
<i>a very worried call from your dad,</i>

1231
01:34:17,467 --> 01:34:19,899
<i>and it all worked out quite well.</i>

1232
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,725
<i>Wait, wait...</i>

1233
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:23,097
Don't touch her! Don't...

1234
01:34:23,168 --> 01:34:25,497
You can still save her.
<i>- Don't!</i>

1235
01:34:25,568 --> 01:34:27,761
<i>But you're gonna have to get away</i>
<i>from your friends.</i>

1236
01:34:27,835 --> 01:34:30,960
<i>Can you handle that?</i>
- Where should I meet you?

1237
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:35,457
How about your old ballet studio?

1238
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:39,000
<i>And I'll know if you bring anyone along.</i>

1239
01:34:40,935 --> 01:34:44,230
<i>Poor Mommy would</i>
<i>pay the price for that mistake.</i>

1240
01:35:01,135 --> 01:35:04,430
<i>I'd never given much thought</i>
<i>to how I would die.</i>

1241
01:35:05,002 --> 01:35:09,400
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love</i>
<i>seems like a good way to go.</i>

1242
01:35:17,402 --> 01:35:22,060
<i>I can't bring myself to regret the decisions</i>
<i>that brought me face-to-face with death.</i>

1243
01:35:22,135 --> 01:35:24,498
<i>They also brought me to Edward.</i>

1244
01:35:53,368 --> 01:35:56,596
Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?

1245
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:57,929
Mom?
- Bella?

1246
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,524
Mom?
- There you are.

1247
01:35:59,601 --> 01:36:01,067
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

1248
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:03,192
<i>Everyone makes fun of me.</i>

1249
01:36:03,868 --> 01:36:06,460
<i>Come on, you're a wonderful dancer.</i>

1250
01:36:06,536 --> 01:36:08,592
<i>Mom, I suck.</i>

1251
01:36:10,002 --> 01:36:11,695
<i>You do not suck.</i>

1252
01:36:21,703 --> 01:36:23,792
That's my favorite part.

1253
01:36:24,703 --> 01:36:27,497
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?

1254
01:36:29,435 --> 01:36:31,595
She's not even here.
- No.

1255
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:35,231
Sorry.

1256
01:36:35,668 --> 01:36:38,725
You know, but you really made it too easy.

1257
01:36:38,802 --> 01:36:42,097
So to make things more entertaining,

1258
01:36:42,703 --> 01:36:45,930
I'm gonna make a little film
of our time together.

1259
01:36:47,536 --> 01:36:50,932
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you don't mind.

1260
01:36:51,002 --> 01:36:52,161
Good.

1261
01:36:52,234 --> 01:36:53,564
And

1262
01:36:54,735 --> 01:36:56,064
action.

1263
01:36:58,469 --> 01:37:00,195
That'll break Edward's little heart.

1264
01:37:00,269 --> 01:37:02,632
You have...
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1265
01:37:02,703 --> 01:37:04,362
But he does.

1266
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:08,060
His rage will make for more interesting sport

1267
01:37:08,135 --> 01:37:11,590
than his feeble attempt to protect you.

1268
01:37:12,903 --> 01:37:14,731
And let's continue.

1269
01:37:29,868 --> 01:37:33,163
Beautiful. Very visually dynamic.

1270
01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:38,225
I chose my stage well.

1271
01:37:43,402 --> 01:37:46,890
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1272
01:37:47,234 --> 01:37:49,962
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1273
01:37:50,034 --> 01:37:51,967
It's cruel, really.

1274
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:58,998
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1275
01:37:59,069 --> 01:38:00,659
Tell him to avenge you. Tell him!

1276
01:38:00,735 --> 01:38:03,530
No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him! Tell him!

1277
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:19,724
You're alone
'cause you're faster than the others.

1278
01:38:22,036 --> 01:38:23,694
But not stronger.

1279
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:27,701
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1280
01:38:34,469 --> 01:38:36,025
I'm sorry.

1281
01:39:39,903 --> 01:39:40,960
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1282
01:39:41,036 --> 01:39:43,466
Son. Enough.

1283
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,202
Remember who you are.

1284
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,296
Bella, you're okay.

1285
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,029
Bella needs you.

1286
01:39:54,435 --> 01:39:56,130
It's okay.

1287
01:39:56,203 --> 01:39:57,565
Oh, God.

1288
01:40:01,336 --> 01:40:03,234
Carlisle? Her blood.

1289
01:40:03,302 --> 01:40:04,893
Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.

1290
01:40:04,969 --> 01:40:06,229
Carlisle!
- Start the fire.

1291
01:40:06,302 --> 01:40:09,029
Get the floorboards.

1292
01:40:09,235 --> 01:40:11,327
Alice!
- Alice, go.

1293
01:40:21,302 --> 01:40:23,326
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1294
01:40:23,402 --> 01:40:25,630
No, no, my head is burning!

1295
01:40:27,136 --> 01:40:28,863
It's the venom.

1296
01:40:29,735 --> 01:40:33,497
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.

1297
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,864
No.

1298
01:40:35,569 --> 01:40:36,761
No.

1299
01:40:38,103 --> 01:40:41,829
It's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

1300
01:40:41,903 --> 01:40:44,868
She's still hemorrhaging.
Alice, make me a tourniquet. Your belt.

1301
01:40:44,935 --> 01:40:47,231
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1302
01:40:48,502 --> 01:40:50,627
Tie it above my hands.

1303
01:40:50,703 --> 01:40:52,100
Carlisle!

1304
01:40:54,002 --> 01:40:55,298
Go.

1305
01:40:59,836 --> 01:41:02,666
We could try to suck the venom out.
- You know I won't be able to stop.

1306
01:41:02,735 --> 01:41:04,929
Then find the will to stop.

1307
01:41:05,868 --> 01:41:07,301
But choose.

1308
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:09,561
She only has minutes left.

1309
01:41:11,735 --> 01:41:14,259
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.

1310
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:18,625
I'm gonna make it go away.

1311
01:41:36,969 --> 01:41:40,423
Edward, stop.
Her blood is clean. You're killing her.

1312
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:42,500
Edward.

1313
01:41:43,002 --> 01:41:44,127
Stop.

1314
01:41:45,336 --> 01:41:46,494
Stop.

1315
01:41:48,069 --> 01:41:49,626
Find the will.

1316
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,363
<i>Death is peaceful, easy.</i>

1317
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:26,497
<i>Life is harder.</i>

1318
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:33,298
Bella?

1319
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:36,462
Baby?

1320
01:42:38,103 --> 01:42:39,329
Bella.

1321
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:42,601
Mom?
- Hey.

1322
01:42:43,336 --> 01:42:44,858
Where is he?

1323
01:42:44,935 --> 01:42:46,402
Where's...

1324
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:48,358
Where's Edward?

1325
01:42:48,436 --> 01:42:49,958
He's asleep.

1326
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,396
He never leaves.

1327
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:55,493
And your dad, he's down at the cafeteria.

1328
01:42:56,002 --> 01:42:57,628
What happened?

1329
01:42:58,203 --> 01:43:01,067
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg,

1330
01:43:02,069 --> 01:43:04,592
and you lost a lot of blood.

1331
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,430
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1332
01:43:09,002 --> 01:43:10,697
Edward came down with his dad

1333
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:13,201
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.

1334
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,634
So you went over to their hotel,
then you tripped,

1335
01:43:16,703 --> 01:43:19,465
and you fell down two flights of stairs.

1336
01:43:20,136 --> 01:43:22,101
Went through a window.

1337
01:43:28,235 --> 01:43:30,099
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1338
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,295
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1339
01:43:36,235 --> 01:43:37,725
It's Phil.

1340
01:43:38,235 --> 01:43:40,292
He's so worried about you.

1341
01:43:41,703 --> 01:43:43,100
You're texting.

1342
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:44,998
Finally, yeah.

1343
01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:48,895
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1344
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:53,025
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day,

1345
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:55,899
and we found the cutest little house,
and you've got your own bathroom.

1346
01:43:55,969 --> 01:43:58,560
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.

1347
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:00,363
What?

1348
01:44:00,804 --> 01:44:02,792
I want to live in Forks.

1349
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,796
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.

1350
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:09,259
Do you mind getting Dad?

1351
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:12,958
I have to talk to him. Apologize.

1352
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:15,797
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.

1353
01:44:16,737 --> 01:44:19,567
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.

1354
01:44:31,369 --> 01:44:33,301
So what happened?

1355
01:44:33,369 --> 01:44:34,961
Where's James?

1356
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:38,069
We took care of it.

1357
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:47,194
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.

1358
01:44:47,737 --> 01:44:49,703
I'm alive because of you.

1359
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:52,234
No, you're in here because of me.

1360
01:44:53,904 --> 01:44:56,664
The worst part of it was that

1361
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:00,497
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1362
01:45:00,569 --> 01:45:02,126
You did stop.

1363
01:45:03,837 --> 01:45:08,064
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1364
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,962
What?

1365
01:45:14,104 --> 01:45:16,194
Are you... No!

1366
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:17,395
No!

1367
01:45:19,336 --> 01:45:21,064
I don't even know what you're... How...

1368
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:23,966
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away? I can't...

1369
01:45:24,037 --> 01:45:26,559
No, I can't... I can't just leave you...

1370
01:45:26,636 --> 01:45:27,966
I know.

1371
01:45:29,869 --> 01:45:31,494
We can't be apart.

1372
01:45:31,569 --> 01:45:33,432
You can't leave me.

1373
01:45:33,936 --> 01:45:35,333
I'm here.

1374
01:45:38,804 --> 01:45:40,632
Okay, just don't...

1375
01:45:40,703 --> 01:45:43,931
You just can't say stuff like that to me. Ever.

1376
01:45:48,436 --> 01:45:50,926
Where else am I gonna go?

1377
01:46:40,636 --> 01:46:43,296
Alice lent me the dress.

1378
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:44,996
The cast is...

1379
01:46:45,936 --> 01:46:47,630
You're perfect.

1380
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,565
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.

1381
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:55,403
I've heard that before.

1382
01:46:59,569 --> 01:47:01,229
All right, Bells.

1383
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:06,095
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.

1384
01:47:06,171 --> 01:47:07,363
Dad.

1385
01:47:07,804 --> 01:47:09,064
And...

1386
01:47:11,104 --> 01:47:13,534
Well, you look beautiful.

1387
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:16,966
Thanks.

1388
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:20,000
See you.

1389
01:47:27,037 --> 01:47:30,025
Hey. I'll be right back.

1390
01:47:32,537 --> 01:47:34,230
Bella.
- Jacob.

1391
01:47:35,136 --> 01:47:36,398
Hey.

1392
01:47:37,203 --> 01:47:39,396
Nice.
- You, too.

1393
01:47:40,136 --> 01:47:43,728
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1394
01:47:43,804 --> 01:47:45,064
No.

1395
01:47:48,904 --> 01:47:51,496
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1396
01:47:52,104 --> 01:47:53,762
Twenty bucks.

1397
01:47:53,837 --> 01:47:55,530
Let's hear it.

1398
01:47:56,337 --> 01:47:58,359
Just don't get mad, okay?

1399
01:47:59,936 --> 01:48:02,926
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1400
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,930
It's just, he said, quote,

1401
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,759
"We'll be watching you."

1402
01:48:11,337 --> 01:48:13,996
Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."
- Okay.

1403
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:17,561
And to pay up.
- Okay. Let me help you.

1404
01:48:17,636 --> 01:48:18,863
Jacob.

1405
01:48:19,537 --> 01:48:21,527
I'll take it from here.

1406
01:48:24,604 --> 01:48:27,091
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1407
01:48:28,837 --> 01:48:30,167
All right.

1408
01:48:37,203 --> 01:48:40,863
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1409
01:48:47,869 --> 01:48:50,666
I can't believe you're making me do this.
- Just smile.

1410
01:48:56,936 --> 01:49:03,801
<i>Tonight! Lightning Strikes!</i>

1411
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:11,266
<i>Don't go stay tonight!</i>

1412
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:14,326
Wow. You are really trying to kill me.

1413
01:49:14,404 --> 01:49:18,926
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I didn't want you to miss anything.

1414
01:49:19,003 --> 01:49:19,992
Oh.

1415
01:49:35,003 --> 01:49:37,868
<i>Everyday we're going all the way</i>

1416
01:49:37,936 --> 01:49:44,631
<i>Everyday, everyday, everyday</i>
<i>we're going all the way</i>

1417
01:49:44,704 --> 01:49:47,033
<i>Tonight! Lightning Strikes!</i>

1418
01:49:47,104 --> 01:49:48,592
Bella, hey!

1419
01:49:51,637 --> 01:49:53,604
Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

1420
01:49:53,805 --> 01:49:56,100
All right, slowing it down.

1421
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:03,594
Shall we?

1422
01:50:04,738 --> 01:50:06,328
You're serious?

1423
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,095
Why not.

1424
01:50:09,304 --> 01:50:12,667
<i> Wide on my plastic toys</i>

1425
01:50:12,738 --> 01:50:17,500
<i>Then when the cops closed the fair</i>

1426
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:21,730
<i>I cut my long baby hair</i>

1427
01:50:21,805 --> 01:50:24,362
<i>Stole me a dog-eared map</i>

1428
01:50:24,438 --> 01:50:26,233
See, you're dancing.

1429
01:50:27,738 --> 01:50:29,135
At prom.

1430
01:50:32,136 --> 01:50:37,194
<i>Have I found you</i>

1431
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:41,863
<i>Flightless bird</i>

1432
01:50:41,938 --> 01:50:46,494
<i>Jealous</i>

1433
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:50,024
<i>Weeping</i>

1434
01:50:50,104 --> 01:50:52,536
Edward, why did you save me?

1435
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:55,069
If you just let the venom spread,

1436
01:50:55,637 --> 01:50:57,831
I could be like you by now.

1437
01:50:59,637 --> 01:51:02,159
You don't know what you're saying.

1438
01:51:03,037 --> 01:51:05,435
You don't want this.
- I want you.

1439
01:51:05,503 --> 01:51:06,868
Always.

1440
01:51:12,438 --> 01:51:15,029
I'm not gonna end your life for you.

1441
01:51:15,104 --> 01:51:17,592
I'm dying already.

1442
01:51:19,503 --> 01:51:21,731
Every second, I get closer.

1443
01:51:22,371 --> 01:51:23,701
Older.

1444
01:51:24,237 --> 01:51:26,725
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1445
01:51:27,637 --> 01:51:30,126
Alice said that she saw me like you.

1446
01:51:30,203 --> 01:51:32,533
I heard her.
- Her visions change.

1447
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:35,092
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1448
01:51:35,837 --> 01:51:37,427
I've decided.

1449
01:51:40,805 --> 01:51:43,292
So that's what you dream about.

1450
01:51:43,371 --> 01:51:45,166
Becoming a monster.

1451
01:51:48,704 --> 01:51:51,603
I dream about being with you forever.

1452
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:53,001
Forever?

1453
01:51:58,137 --> 01:52:00,261
And you're ready right now?

1454
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,497
Yes.

1455
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:10,527
<i>Bleeding or lost you</i>

1456
01:52:10,604 --> 01:52:15,162
<i>American mouth</i>

1457
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:20,465
<i>Big pill</i>

1458
01:52:20,537 --> 01:52:25,028
Is it not enough
just to have a long and happy life with me?

1459
01:52:32,637 --> 01:52:33,899
Yeah.

1460
01:52:35,337 --> 01:52:36,701
For now.

1461
01:53:05,204 --> 01:53:07,568
<i>No one will surrender tonight,</i>

1462
01:53:08,671 --> 01:53:10,533
<i>but I won't give in.</i>

1463
01:53:11,837 --> 01:53:13,735
<i>I know what I want.</i>

1464
01:53:19,805 --> 01:53:24,896
<i>Have I found you</i>

1465
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:29,493
<i>Flightless bird</i>

1466
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:34,162
<i>Grounded</i>

1467
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:41,194
<i>Bleeding or lost you</i>

1468
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:47,163
<i>American mouth</i>

1469
01:53:56,372 --> 01:53:59,564
<i> How come I end up where I started</i>

1470
01:53:59,637 --> 01:54:02,661
<i>How come I end up where I went wrong</i>

1471
01:54:02,738 --> 01:54:05,931
<i>Won't take my eyes off the ball again</i>

1472
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:09,198
<i>You reel me out then you cut the string</i>

1473
01:54:15,372 --> 01:54:18,462
<i>How come I end up where I started</i>

1474
01:54:18,538 --> 01:54:21,505
<i>How come I end up where I went wrong</i>

1475
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:24,503
<i>Won't take my eyes off the ball again</i>

1476
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:28,402
<i>First you reel me out</i>
<i>and then you cut the string</i>

1477
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:43,631
<i>You used to be all right</i>

1478
01:54:43,704 --> 01:54:46,364
<i>What happened?</i>

1479
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:52,701
<i>Did the cat get your tongue</i>

1480
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:59,533
<i>Did your string come undone</i>

1481
01:54:59,604 --> 01:55:05,832
<i>One by one</i>

1482
01:55:05,904 --> 01:55:11,270
<i>One by one</i>

1483
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:17,860
<i>It comes to us all</i>

1484
01:55:17,938 --> 01:55:24,837
<i>It's as soft as your pillow</i>

1485
01:56:08,305 --> 01:56:10,930
<i> I dreamed I was missing</i>

1486
01:56:11,005 --> 01:56:14,061
<i>You were so scared</i>

1487
01:56:14,137 --> 01:56:16,899
<i>But no one would listen</i>

1488
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:20,404
<i>'Cause no one else cared</i>

1489
01:56:20,471 --> 01:56:22,960
<i>After my dreaming</i>

1490
01:56:23,037 --> 01:56:26,402
<i>I woke with this fear</i>

1491
01:56:26,471 --> 01:56:28,869
<i>What am I leaving</i>

1492
01:56:28,938 --> 01:56:32,063
<i>When I'm done here?</i>

1493
01:56:32,137 --> 01:56:34,569
<i>So if you're asking me</i>

1494
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:38,469
<i>I want you to know</i>

1495
01:56:38,538 --> 01:56:40,595
<i>When my time comes</i>

1496
01:56:40,671 --> 01:56:43,762
<i>Forget the wrong that I've done</i>

1497
01:56:43,838 --> 01:56:46,634
<i>Help me leave behind some</i>

1498
01:56:46,706 --> 01:56:50,467
<i>Reasons to be missed</i>

1499
01:56:50,538 --> 01:56:52,663
<i>Don't resent me</i>

1500
01:56:52,738 --> 01:56:55,671
<i>And when you're feeling empty</i>

1501
01:56:55,738 --> 01:56:58,603
<i>Keep me in your memory</i>

1502
01:56:58,671 --> 01:57:01,762
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1503
01:57:01,838 --> 01:57:04,360
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1504
01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:07,302
<i>Forgetting all the hurt inside</i>

1505
01:57:07,372 --> 01:57:10,304
<i>You've learned to hide so well</i>

1506
01:57:10,372 --> 01:57:13,202
<i>Pretending someone else can come</i>

1507
01:57:13,271 --> 01:57:16,328
<i>And save me from myself</i>

1508
01:57:16,404 --> 01:57:20,394
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1509
01:57:20,471 --> 01:57:22,563
<i>When my time comes</i>

1510
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,662
<i>Forget the wrong that I've done</i>

1511
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:28,704
<i>Help me leave behind some</i>

1512
01:57:28,771 --> 01:57:32,430
<i>Reasons to be missed</i>

1513
01:57:32,505 --> 01:57:34,470
<i>Don't resent me</i>

1514
01:57:34,538 --> 01:57:37,663
<i>And when you're feeling empty</i>

1515
01:57:37,738 --> 01:57:40,398
<i>Keep me in your memory</i>

1516
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:43,666
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1517
01:57:43,738 --> 01:57:46,296
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1518
01:57:46,372 --> 01:57:49,132
<i>Forgetting all the hurt inside</i>

1519
01:57:49,204 --> 01:57:52,261
<i>You've learned to hide so well</i>

1520
01:57:52,337 --> 01:57:55,032
<i>Pretending someone else can come</i>

1521
01:57:55,105 --> 01:57:58,298
<i>And save me from myself</i>

1522
01:57:58,372 --> 01:58:04,235
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1523
01:58:04,305 --> 01:58:08,738
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1524
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:19,469
<i> How can I decide what's right</i>

1525
01:58:19,538 --> 01:58:22,733
<i>When you're clouding up my mind</i>

1526
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:25,966
<i>I can't win your losing fight</i>

1527
01:58:26,038 --> 01:58:28,028
<i>All the time</i>

1528
01:58:28,105 --> 01:58:31,197
<i>How can I ever own what's mine</i>

1529
01:58:31,271 --> 01:58:34,295
<i>When you're always taking sides</i>

1530
01:58:34,372 --> 01:58:37,304
<i>But you won't take away my pride</i>

1531
01:58:37,372 --> 01:58:43,600
<i>No, not this time</i>

1532
01:58:43,671 --> 01:58:50,627
<i>No, not this time</i>

1533
01:58:51,404 --> 01:58:54,064
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1534
01:58:54,139 --> 01:59:01,095
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1535
01:59:03,038 --> 01:59:05,936
<i>But how did we get here?</i>

1536
01:59:06,006 --> 01:59:12,927
<i>I think I know</i>

1537
01:59:20,805 --> 01:59:23,930
<i>The truth is hiding in your eyes</i>

1538
01:59:24,006 --> 01:59:27,063
<i>And its hanging on your tongue</i>

1539
01:59:27,139 --> 01:59:29,502
<i>Just boiling in my blood</i>

1540
01:59:29,572 --> 01:59:32,231
<i>But you think that I can't see</i>

1541
01:59:32,305 --> 01:59:35,600
<i>What kind of man that you are</i>

1542
01:59:35,671 --> 01:59:38,694
<i>If you're a man at all</i>

1543
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:45,671
<i>Well, I will figure this one out on my own</i>

1544
01:59:47,105 --> 01:59:52,537
<i>I'm screaming I love you so</i>

1545
01:59:52,604 --> 01:59:55,537
<i>My thoughts you can't decode</i>

1546
01:59:55,604 --> 01:59:58,537
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1547
01:59:58,604 --> 02:00:05,560
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1548
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:09,900
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>But how did we get here?</i>

1549
02:00:09,971 --> 02:00:16,927
<i>Well, I think I know how</i>

1550
02:00:29,405 --> 02:00:35,065
<i>Do you see what we've done</i>

1551
02:00:35,139 --> 02:00:40,935
<i>We're gonna make such fools of ourselves</i>

1552
02:00:42,439 --> 02:00:45,304
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1553
02:00:45,372 --> 02:00:49,930
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1554
02:00:50,006 --> 02:00:53,961
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1555
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:56,903
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1556
02:00:56,971 --> 02:01:03,927
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1557
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:08,166
<i>I think I know</i>

1558
02:01:11,405 --> 02:01:17,202
<i>There is something I see in you</i>

1559
02:01:17,273 --> 02:01:19,966
<i>It might kill me</i>

1560
02:01:20,038 --> 02:01:26,369
<i>I want it to be true</i>
