{932}{983}|This is Meredith.
{984}{1046}|This isn't a popularity contest.
{1048}{1148}|I don't care if it's the Friday before Christmas.|She'll have Monday off.
{1149}{1290}|Look, the bottom line is there's no way I'm|letting that report go without having seen it.
{1292}{1389}|All right, get Rebecca to reach Ken.|He should be on the ground by now.
{1391}{1445}|You tell him, forward his file...
{1448}{1570}|She's gonna have to change her reservation.|Hold on, I've got another call. Don't leave.
{1572}{1655}|This is Meredith. Terrific.|All right, I'm gonna call you back.
{1657}{1747}|I said... Don't leave.|No, no, no. I said I'd call you back.
{1748}{1837}|- Thank you.|- Combine the files, I'll look over...
{1839}{1916}|Everett, Everett.|Is that for Amy? The red one.
{1917}{1999}|I'll look them over,|but tell her to tell the printers to...
{2002}{2084}|No, no. You know, forget it.|Wait. I'm gonna call you back.
{2085}{2133}|- The red one, please.|- Red?
{2135}{2185}|Yeah, that's perfect.
{2285}{2309}|Merry Christmas.
{5391}{5431}|Mom.
{5433}{5494}|Merry Christmas.
{5520}{5571}|Boys.
{5648}{5737}|Boys? Patrick.
{5740}{5796}|We hit traffic.
{5900}{5963}|You look so good.
{5998}{6097}|Wait, Patrick, I found another recipe|on the gourmet site this morning.
{6099}{6208}|Well, it better not be for onions. I emailed you|my mother's recipe this morning.
{6211}{6307}|- Mom, where's Everett?|- He promised me they'd be here by dinner.
{6309}{6382}|Did you hear from Ben?|We didn't know when his flight was in.
{6384}{6473}|Well, of course.|He missed both morning flights.
{6475}{6547}|Honey, we're in here.
{6548}{6615}|Millie's famous brownies.
{6616}{6676}|So sweet of her.
{6768}{6830}|- Thaddeus.|- Dad.
{6896}{6942}|- Patrick.|- Hey.
{6953}{7000}|Merry Christmas.
{8117}{8167}|Sorry.
{8483}{8564}|- You don't have to be nervous.|- I'm not.
{8566}{8596}|They'll love you.
{8598}{8645}|- I hate her.|- Amy.
{8648}{8721}|- What?|- Generosity. Generosity of spirit.
{8724}{8783}|- Thank you.|- You're gonna get me in trouble.
{8785}{8880}|- I thought no one had met the girl.|- No. I was in New York in October...
{8883}{8972}|That's right, that young man.|What was his name? How's that going?
{8975}{9057}|- Kelly.|- Sorry.
{9084}{9197}|- So, you had dinner with them.|- So, she is a total phony.
{9199}{9294}|She's completely uptight.|She dragged us to this stiff restaurant,
{9296}{9356}|she talked the entire time. I mean...
{9358}{9414}|- You just wait.|- What?
{9416}{9542}|She's got this incredibly grotesque|throat-clearing tic. It's like...
{9625}{9723}|- It's like she's digging for clams.|- Make way for ducklings.
{9724}{9786}|- Susannah, honey.|- Susannah.
{9788}{9846}|- Hi, sweetie.|- Grandma.
{9849}{9899}|Look at this.
{9902}{9999}|Hi. Long trip. I gotta pee.
{10000}{10052}|God, you're huge.
{10054}{10115}|- Granddaughter.|- Grandpa.
{10117}{10184}|Hi, sweetheart. How are you?
{10187}{10298}|- Is Everett here yet?|- Amy was just telling us all about Meredith.
{10300}{10360}|She's a throat-clearer.
{10362}{10456}|- Sybil, why do you encourage her?|- Well, Amy never likes anyone.
{10458}{10527}|Patrick.
{10537}{10589}|I love you.
{10591}{10653}|That took years.
{10700}{10761}|So, you got her on the phone once, right?
{10763}{10845}|- A little curt.|- She didn't do that throat thing?
{10848}{10933}|What are you talking about?|I have to pee. When's Ben getting here?
{10936}{10980}|They're here.
{11013}{11084}|Ready?
{11086}{11149}|- They're all watching, you know.|- They?
{11243}{11343}|Kelly'll be out in a minute|and he'll bring us in.
{11641}{11708}|- Everett.|- Dad.
{11709}{11753}|Hi.
{11780}{11851}|I told you. Did I tell you?
{11853}{11889}|Yeah.
{11892}{11941}|Hello.
{12082}{12145}|Hi.
{12148}{12208}|How are you?
{12211}{12285}|Thad. Meredith. Meredith, this is Thad.
{12288}{12355}|Oh, yes. Thaddeus.
{12356}{12408}|Hello. I'm Meredith.
{12410}{12469}|I've heard so much about you.
{12472}{12525}|- And this is Patrick.|- Hello.
{12527}{12587}|- Hello.|- Hello.
{12589}{12666}|- Why is she shouting?|- You remember Amy, right?
{12668}{12727}|Amy. Yes. Merry Christmas.
{12729}{12804}|- You remember me, right? The mother.|- That's right.
{12806}{12893}|And this is Sybil. Mom, this is Meredith.
{12907}{12975}|Hello. You have a lovely home.
{12976}{13090}|All the better to entertain you, my dear.|Well, welcome.
{13092}{13182}|- Merry Christmas. Welcome to our home.|- Mom, don't overdo it.
{13185}{13235}|- What am I overdoing?|- Hi.
{13236}{13331}|Welcome. I'm Susannah, and this is Elizabeth.
{13344}{13408}|You have nice shoes.
{13447}{13497}|Thank you.
{13538}{13616}|- All right. Let me get a picture, please.|- Picture time.
{13618}{13674}|Family photo.
{13676}{13763}|- Just move in.|- Stand in front of your mother.
{13765}{13813}|Patrick, move in close.
{13815}{13911}|- OK, wait.|- Amy, come on, get in there. Here we go.
{13913}{13956}|Where's Ben?
{13959}{14022}|Move closer. Everett.
{14052}{14120}|Why are you making such a big deal?|Can it really matter?
{14123}{14270}|Yes. I think it matters, and I am not sleeping|with you in your bed in your parents' house.
{14272}{14373}|- Sybil put us in here together.|- And I said I don't think it's right.
{14375}{14448}|What you're saying is you just don't screw?
{14451}{14510}|- Nice, Mom. That's nice.|- Is that it?
{14512}{14577}|I know how fun this could be for you,|but really...
{14579}{14711}|- But separate bedrooms? It's so silly.|- She just doesn't feel comfortable.
{14713}{14823}|Well, why should she be comfortable?|Putting Amy out of her room and all.
{14824}{14866}|What?
{14868}{14968}|- I hope I'm not putting anyone out.|- Me out. You're putting me out.
{14978}{15115}|Why aren't you sleeping in Everett's room?|He's your friend. Did you have a fight?
{15117}{15175}|- Of course not.|- Can I try your shoes?
{15177}{15277}|I'm so sorry.|There must be someplace else I...
{15356}{15443}|This is Meredith. Hold on.
{15445}{15496}|It's my sister.
{15607}{15702}|Yes. Well, we'll just be downstairs.|Give you your privacy.
{15704}{15785}|Come on, honey. Elizabeth, let's go. Careful.
{15919}{15960}|Amy.
{16031}{16079}|Let's go. Careful now.
{16132}{16192}|They hate me.
{16219}{16283}|Yes, I'm being myself.
{16455}{16572}|- Can I come in?|- You don't need an invitation, Meredith.
{16690}{16776}|- Don't be mad.|- I'm not mad.
{16804}{16881}|But don't be thinking|you'll be getting any now.
{16984}{17063}|Why would you keep those in here?|Don't you?
{17064}{17119}|That's...
{17157}{17225}|That's from a long time ago.
{17341}{17444}|This isn't easy for me, meeting everyone.
{17446}{17510}|I know it's not.
{17644}{17701}|Look at them.
{17732}{17798}|Just look at them.
{17980}{18036}|- Ben? My God.|- Amy.
{18039}{18101}|- Wait until you meet her.|- Meet who? Come here.
{18103}{18172}|- Meredith.|- No smoking pot in the house.
{18174}{18247}|No pot in the house. I mean it this time.
{18336}{18370}|Merry Christmas, Mom.
{18372}{18466}|And Christmas is not clothing optional|this year. We've got company.
{18468}{18528}|- Got you.|- OK.
{18529}{18624}|- Who's this? Have you been working out?|- Hey, Ben.
{18626}{18708}|Everett. Wow, Everett in a tie. Look at this.
{18710}{18796}|- I'm running for mayor.|- You look gorgeous.
{18798}{18894}|That's true. I want you to meet Meredith.
{19005}{19068}|Hi.
{19070}{19096}|- Hey.|- Hey.
{19098}{19143}|Hi. Hi.
{19145}{19254}|- What is going on with him?|- All hail. The prodigal son returns.
{19257}{19320}|Hey, Mama. I found your laundry here.
{19323}{19411}|A big sack of filthy Christmas laundry,|just for you.
{19412}{19453}|Hey.
{19455}{19518}|- Where's your husband?|- What husband?
{19556}{19627}|That husband. He'll be here on Christmas.
{19628}{19691}|Queen bee, how are you doing?
{19751}{19833}|- So, where's Dad?|- He ran away. Joined the circus.
{19836}{19941}|- A better circus.|- Yeah, less clowns.
{20038}{20102}|Sorry. We might have some glue.
{20104}{20171}|No, it's OK.
{20173}{20255}|I think I have another pair for that outfit.
{20280}{20333}|It's a good color.
{20358}{20398}|Excuse me.
{20460}{20540}|You need a hand with that?
{20541}{20624}|Now, don't dilly-dally there, pretty lady.
{20627}{20719}|We're all gonna be down here|talking about you.
{20821}{20894}|Do you remember Miss Lewin?|Remember her?
{20896}{20928}|- Second grade?|- Yeah.
{20929}{21036}|- Wait, the one without the lips?|- Exactly. Man, I was so into her.
{21038}{21116}|- You are a freak.|- Yeah.
{21118}{21236}|- She's sweet, right. Incredible.|- Thank you, sir.
{21238}{21346}|- I mean, doesn't she seem incredible?|- Yeah, it appears that she is incredible.
{21348}{21413}|So, Everett, where'd you find her?
{21415}{21471}|Hong Kong, last spring.
{21473}{21559}|Well, actually, over on Kowloon side,|not Hong Kong Island.
{21562}{21639}|Although we were both staying there -|on Hong Kong Island -
{21641}{21713}|Everett at the Grand Hyatt,|I was at the Mandarin.
{21715}{21792}|But we were introduced|in the lobby of the Peninsula.
{21794}{21869}|That's on Kowloon side.
{21908}{21984}|I was there for|this post-postunification conference,
{21986}{22091}|and I had a meeting over at the Peninsula,|and there I am, crossing the lobby,
{22092}{22187}|and who do I see but Rachel Graham?
{22188}{22257}|- Who?|- What were you wearing?
{22260}{22352}|It had been, what? 10 years?|More? God, almost 16. Andover.
{22354}{22448}|I'm with Rachel, and here comes Everett.|I don't know him, Rachel does.
{22450}{22573}|They got their masters together. You hadn't|seen each other in, what? Eight years?
{22575}{22656}|- The point is, Everett was lost. Remember?|- What?
{22658}{22713}|- How you were lost?|- I was pretending.
{22715}{22807}|He was on his way to take some boat to...|What was the name of that place?
{22810}{22855}|Lantau. Lantau Island.
{22858}{22943}|Right. Some pilgrimage|he'd gotten into his head,
{22945}{23025}|on his way to see some Buddhist statue|at some monastery.
{23028}{23096}|It's one of the largest metal buddhas|in the world.
{23098}{23158}|- Metal buddha.|- Over three stories tall.
{23160}{23249}|- Fascinating.|- You can stay at this monastery. Actually...
{23251}{23332}|share meals with the monks.|But they've taken a vow of silence.
{23334}{23386}|A vow of what?
{23399}{23452}|Your tie's crooked.
{23476}{23563}|- Incredible. How long were you there?|- Well, he never made it.
{23565}{23689}|One thing led to another,|Rachel suggested lunch, we got to talking.
{23691}{23752}|Everett, what did you two talk about?
{23754}{23805}|I don't remember.
{23807}{23914}|- It's just a little tight.|- Will you take that goddamn tie off already?
{23916}{23985}|Please. Of course you remember.
{23987}{24086}|Everett was with Steve, working out|their position for the IPO this spring.
{24088}{24159}|- Well, of course, that's what I do.|- Really?
{24160}{24216}|Within the Asian market.
{24217}{24326}|Anyway, so lunch led to drinks,|which led to dinner,
{24328}{24483}|and Rachel took off, and, really, that's how|Everett and I spent our first night together,
{24486}{24551}|me putting in my two cents|going over that report.
{24553}{24677}|I just showed Everett a few things|that needed to be done.
{24756}{24825}|Meredith was a real help.
{24827}{24921}|We were just lucky -|both in the right place at the right time.
{24923}{24981}|- Destiny.|- Destiny.
{24984}{25046}|- Right, honey?|- Right.
{25138}{25183}|Well.
{25186}{25271}|- OK, so...|- Here. Let me help you with that.
{25273}{25336}|No, no, no. No, don't trouble yourself.
{25338}{25409}|You're the guest. All right.
{25412}{25510}|Well, then, maybe I'll just wash my hands.
{25584}{25694}|- All right, Ben, come on.|- I'm still working on it, honey.
{25696}{25773}|- I told you this...|- It's in there.
{25776}{25819}|- Mom.|- What?
{25820}{25920}|- Mom, listen. I wanna talk to you.|- Yeah, I'm sure you do.
{25922}{26007}|- There's something I wanna ask you.|- Yeah.
{26009}{26127}|I thought that might be it,|but now's not the time. I...
{26251}{26302}|- Safe.|- Done.
{26304}{26399}|- Open. Opening it out.|- Chest. Hair. Chest hair. No?
{26401}{26466}|- "Billy Don't Be A Hero."|- What?
{26468}{26513}|Thank you.
{26515}{26575}|- That's a song?|- Yes, you've heard it.
{26578}{26663}|- No.|- Whose clue was that? It's not good.
{26727}{26787}|- I wanna go again.|- No, wind it down.
{26789}{26896}|No, no, no, Elizabeth,|Meredith hasn't had a turn yet.
{26898}{26957}|- No, that's all right.|- No, I'll find one.
{26959}{27013}|- Really, I don't...|- Come on. Come on.
{27016}{27098}|- Come on, La Mer.|- There. That one's perfect.
{27217}{27279}|It's a movie.
{27303}{27342}|- Movie.|- No talking.
{27345}{27383}|Amy.
{27443}{27491}|Movie.
{27516}{27593}|Four words. Second word.
{27652}{27706}|Beekeeper.
{27708}{27773}|<i>Ulee's Gold?</i>
{27807}{27856}|Second word.
{27927}{27988}|- Wedding.|- Marriage.
{27990}{28065}|- Ring.|- Bride.
{28067}{28123}|- <i>Princess Bride.</i>|- Four words.
{28124}{28195}|Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
{28196}{28252}|- No, that's six.|- You know the answer.
{28254}{28315}|- I'm just trying to help.|- Third word.
{28407}{28466}|- Clothes?|- Nylons?
{28468}{28536}|- Style? Apparel?|- Suit?
{28538}{28604}|Fourth word.
{28606}{28682}|It's OK, it's OK. Fourth word.
{28713}{28828}|- I can't believe you're pointing at him.|- What? Who?
{28892}{28953}|- No...|- You're pointing at him.
{28955}{29043}|- Which guy?|- I wasn't pointing at him.
{29045}{29114}|- You still are.|- No, I'm not.
{29116}{29156}|- My God.|- Is he a clue?
{29158}{29218}|Fourth word.
{29220}{29280}|- I wasn't.|- Fourth word.
{29282}{29330}|- Yeah.|- Meredith.
{29332}{29424}|- You guys are such unbelievable jerks.|- Meredith, come on.
{29426}{29504}|- What just happened?|- Fetch that for me, please.
{29528}{29615}|- You don't even know how to read.|- What was the answer?
{29616}{29686}|"<i>The Bride Wore Black.</i>"
{29775}{29827}|Thank you, Amy.
{29828}{29887}|Why do you always have|to be such a meanie?
{29890}{29928}|I don't.
{29936}{29990}|What did I ever do to her?
{29992}{30106}|You can't let her run you off like that.|She's getting back at you for taking her room.
{30108}{30178}|Yeah. Some help you were in that department.
{30180}{30262}|The natives would never dream|of letting their god sleep on a couch.
{30264}{30334}|Not when they have me to blame.
{30336}{30474}|- Meredith, now you're being...|- I am not a completely ridiculous person.
{30485}{30563}|I can see you beginning|to look at me like they do.
{30565}{30615}|No, that's not true.
{30618}{30677}|Isn't it?
{30679}{30798}|You're telling me you're not wondering|why you brought me here?
{30801}{30895}|- That you're not beginning to have doubts?|- No.
{30898}{30980}|That you don't wish I were different?
{30982}{31060}|Different? Different how?
{31132}{31200}|I was joking.
{31203}{31265}|I was just joking.
{31299}{31377}|I wouldn't want you|just because you were a good guy
{31379}{31523}|who got caught up in something|and then couldn't find the brake.
{31551}{31612}|I'm not a good guy.
{31659}{31717}|Yes, you are.
{31745}{31832}|He's coming for that ring.|That's what he wants to talk to me about.
{31835}{31904}|He intends to give that girl|my mother's wedding ring.
{31906}{32004}|What I don't understand|is what he sees in her.
{32054}{32136}|See, I was onto you, Mr. Oh So Innocent.
{32139}{32239}|I don't mean that. She's attractive,|intelligent, obviously successful.
{32242}{32300}|She's better mannered than any one of us.
{32303}{32344}|Give me a break.
{32347}{32460}|Stick a silver spoon up any monkey's butt,|it will go "please" and "thank you." Big deal.
{32463}{32555}|- She is a fine woman.|- So fine.
{32556}{32629}|She doesn't seem to know|or trust herself very well.
{32632}{32701}|Thank you, Professor.
{32703}{32847}|Which means, I'm afraid,|that our Everett may not know himself at all.
{33478}{33571}|You're up early. Did you sleep all right?
{33573}{33678}|- Thank you. Has Everett woken?|- It's freezing. Is there coffee?
{33681}{33764}|- Coming up.|- Good morning, Amy.
{34028}{34112}|- Hello, my last-born.|- Good morning.
{34138}{34225}|I meant to tell you, we got a card|from the Stevensons the other day.
{34227}{34300}|- You remember Brad, don't you?|- Very funny.
{34303}{34366}|Brad. Brad Stevenson.
{34368}{34468}|- Still in town, still available.|- Yeah, well.
{34470}{34530}|- Brad popped Amy's cherry.|- Mom.
{34578}{34638}|I'm sorry, dear. Is that not accurate?
{34687}{34769}|He's holding out for her.|He got a taste of something he liked.
{34772}{34824}|OK, Mom.
{34826}{34895}|Could you not?
{34897}{34959}|Milk's in the fridge if you need it.
{35125}{35211}|- Amy, you take milk?|- Yeah. But I can do it.
{35631}{35766}|I'm really sorry that you had to sleep on|the couch last night. Maybe we can take turns.
{35768}{35828}|Don't sweat it.
{35901}{35981}|I wish you'd give me a chance,|whatever it is that I did wrong.
{35984}{36051}|I said don't sweat it.
{36072}{36110}|I...
{36112}{36208}|I don't know what I did to you,|I really don't, but, you know,
{36211}{36298}|I don't care whether you like me or not.
{36328}{36391}|Of course you do.
{36511}{36560}|- She's going to the inn?|- What excuse?
{36563}{36633}|Something about having a bad back.
{36664}{36751}|Said they'd put a board|under the mattress at the inn.
{36753}{36786}|Amy.
{36788}{36857}|Be the kind child I know you to be, please.
{36859}{36970}|Well, we are definitely in trouble now.
{36972}{37047}|- Here he comes.|- Go. Go. Come on.
{37348}{37398}|- Good morning.|- Morning.
{37515}{37599}|- Excuse me, family.|- Everett.
{37602}{37689}|- I wanna know who said something to her.|- To whom, dear?
{37691}{37778}|- Meredith's checking in to the inn.|- We actually heard about that.
{37780}{37843}|- And her sister Julie is coming.|- Her sister?
{37845}{37963}|Her sister, whom I've never met, is giving up|Christmas with her family to be with her.
{37964}{38054}|- Come on, now. She called her sister?|- That's it.
{38180}{38258}|I see what's going on here.
{38260}{38323}|I knew it wasn't gonna be easy with you guys.
{38326}{38408}|I figured you'd give her a hard time,|have a laugh, then back off.
{38410}{38496}|- Everett, honey, really...|- Please, Mom.
{38499}{38568}|Now, if this is about me...
{38733}{38803}|OK, this is how this is gonna go.
{38804}{38916}|You will all pull your fangs out of her and|remind yourselves that whatever you think,
{38919}{38971}|Meredith means a lot to me.
{38973}{39047}|So you'd better start getting used to the idea.
{39050}{39096}|OK.
{39171}{39284}|- Everett.|- I expected a little more, at least of you.
{39719}{39747}|What?
{39750}{39876}|Well, you know, the coffee's|not too good over there at the inn.
{39905}{39948}|Thank you.
{39949}{40052}|So, you're coming back, right?|You'll come back?
{40054}{40123}|- Yeah. I'm just checking in.|- Good.
{40124}{40182}|Good deal.
{40277}{40317}|Oh, boy.
{40344}{40403}|What a day.
{40438}{40508}|Well, thank you.
{40509}{40580}|Yeah, I had a dream about you last night.
{40641}{40699}|- What?|- Yeah. I did.
{40701}{40775}|I ended up having a dream about you.
{40800}{40895}|- Well, what was I doing?|- Let's go.
{41003}{41073}|Are you coming?
{41075}{41199}|You know, you gotta make sure to bring|back the mug 'cause it's Sybil's favorite.
{41200}{41280}|- Or she'll kill you.|- OK.
{41322}{41358}|So,
{41360}{41431}|we are going to welcome Meredith back
{41433}{41515}|withoutjudgment.
{41535}{41672}|We will welcome her and her sister Julie|into our home with open arms.
{41674}{41807}|We will try to behave|like a civilized family might.
{41809}{41907}|- Right, Amy?|- Why do you keep singling me out?
{41909}{42005}|Imagine what she had to have felt|in order for her to call her sister.
{42007}{42078}|She is staying.|You gotta give her credit for that.
{42080}{42150}|Excuse me.|I'd like to say something here if I may.
{42152}{42228}|Forget it. And I know you gave her my mug.
{42230}{42280}|Let's vote Ben off the island.
{42282}{42346}|- I'm ashamed of all of you.|- There's news.
{42348}{42423}|- Even you.|- He's gonna ask me for that ring. I know it.
{42425}{42497}|- He can't marry her.|- Thank you. Where have you been?
{42499}{42583}|- They don't love each other.|- He'll ask for that ring.
{42586}{42659}|Mom. Enough about the ring.
{42662}{42736}|- What ring?|- Grandma's wedding ring.
{42802}{42837}|- Mom.|- Yep.
{42840}{42889}|This is the woman I'm gonna marry.
{42891}{42963}|You're talking about Meredith, right?
{43058}{43116}|Mom, remember when|I was dating Becket Royce?
{43118}{43224}|But she was great, now.|Wonder whatever happened to her.
{43225}{43360}|What you told me was when I met the woman|who was to be my wife, I should come to you.
{43363}{43484}|I should come to you because you wanted|that woman to wear your mother's ring.
{43487}{43618}|Well, I've met that woman, and I wanna|ask you for the ring that you promised me.
{43620}{43700}|I'm gonna give it to Meredith tomorrow.
{43724}{43769}|On Christmas.
{43906}{43953}|Mom.
{44073}{44126}|No.
{44149}{44197}|- Mom.|- I can't. That woman.
{44199}{44247}|- "That woman"?|- OK, Meredith.
{44250}{44364}|It's just, honey, I can't give you|my mother's wedding ring so that she...
{44367}{44439}|- You made a promise to me.|- Tough shit.
{44441}{44511}|I'm sorry.
{44532}{44585}|I know you're disappointed,
{44588}{44656}|but think how I feel.
{44821}{44874}|God.
{44914}{45035}|Goddammit! Who took the last|of the coffee and didn't make more?
{45037}{45097}|There's supposed to be a pot right here.
{45100}{45151}|I mean, who doesn't know the rules?
{45154}{45220}|- I'm sorry, I was just wash...|- You're back.
{45222}{45280}|I can make more coffee.
{45301}{45425}|- All right, who put all the crap on my desk?|- Meredith's making us breakfast.
{45427}{45465}|It's for tomorrow.
{45468}{45596}|It's for Christmas morning.|It's strata. It's a Morton family tradition.
{45663}{45825}|I know you and Patrick have dinner planned|out, but I wanted to contribute something.
{45827}{45917}|And my sister's coming. I just wanted...
{45919}{46031}|I just wanted to do something for everyone.
{46064}{46144}|Well, that should be nice.
{46145}{46211}|Everything all right at the inn?
{46212}{46251}|Yes, thank you.
{46254}{46348}|I hope they put you in a room|near Patrick and Thad.
{46497}{46569}|Thank you for bringing my mug back.
{46753}{46843}|Going to be a lot|of broken hearts in this town.
{46844}{46917}|- What do you think of this?|- That's a beautiful choice.
{46919}{46998}|Platinum setting.|I believe that's a three-carat stone.
{47000}{47051}|And that's good?
{47052}{47138}|Thad, what do you think? Is it big enough?
{47140}{47225}|Let me just look up the specifics on that one.
{47390}{47439}|Do you see a different one?
{47442}{47500}|Don't do it.
{47521}{47588}|- What?|- Marry her, Everett.
{47590}{47669}|Please, don't marry her.
{47671}{47768}|Thad, I am getting married.
{47905}{47959}|Is this about Mom?
{48020}{48076}|Of course it's about Mom.
{48087}{48183}|Here we are. It's a lovely ring.
{48224}{48315}|So the bread absorbs this, and then...
{48317}{48367}|- Hi, Susannah.|- Have you seen Mom?
{48370}{48442}|Yeah. She's taking a nap.
{48486}{48596}|And then, really,|it's just as fast as your wrist allows.
{48598}{48662}|- Fast, fast, fast.|- You've done that before.
{48664}{48707}|Every Christmas.
{50556}{50615}|Who else knows?
{50979}{51028}|- Do you want a brownie?|- No, thanks.
{51031}{51081}|Good.
{51321}{51421}|So it's worse this time, isn't it?
{51545}{51601}|What do you mean?
{51603}{51667}|Mom, Dad.
{51669}{51736}|I mean Mom.
{51837}{51907}|It's not good.
{52033}{52124}|I only found out a couple of weeks ago.
{52201}{52275}|But you've known longer than that.
{52312}{52377}|Well, we weren't sure.
{52461}{52599}|And she wanted to wait, you know,|until after Christmas to tell you kids.
{52965}{53027}|I know, Ben. I know.
{53281}{53331}|This gets folded in.
{53334}{53410}|A touch more oregano.
{53412}{53451}|More Parmesan.
{53454}{53543}|It goes in the fridge overnight|and bakes for a bit in the morning.
{53544}{53621}|- Are those mushrooms?|- Yeah, those are mushrooms.
{53624}{53680}|Isn't Everett allergic to mushrooms?
{53682}{53731}|He is?
{53833}{53885}|Hi, honey. What?
{53916}{53974}|Well. Well.
{53976}{54028}|OK.
{54060}{54143}|- Honey.|- I love you, Mom. I love you.
{54229}{54286}|What's going on?
{54333}{54396}|What's wrong?
{54452}{54529}|Did you and Daddy have fun getting stoned?
{54546}{54604}|- Kelly.|- Yeah.
{54740}{54774}|OK.
{54777}{54880}|What have we got going on over here,|in Santa's workshop?
{54914}{55030}|OK, what can I do to be of service?|Meredith, what can I do to make you happy?
{55032}{55103}|Well, I think I'm all set.
{55106}{55190}|Everett had to run some errands in town,
{55192}{55295}|and then he and Thad|were going to meet Julie's bus.
{55296}{55380}|- Now, are those mushrooms?|- I didn't know!
{56161}{56226}|What does she look like?
{56228}{56290}|I only saw a picture of her once.
{56494}{56551}|Is that her?
{56581}{56613}|- Julie.|- Ow.
{56615}{56735}|- You all right? Think you can stand?|- Yeah, I'm OK. Yeah. Ow.
{56738}{56794}|- What is it?|- No, nothing, just my knee.
{56796}{56871}|- Sorry. I didn't see you.|- No, no, it's my fault.
{56874}{56923}|Can you bend it?
{56965}{57026}|Yeah. Yeah. No, it's fine.
{57028}{57085}|Thank you. God.
{57134}{57228}|- Hi.|- Hi. OK. Thanks.
{57269}{57316}|- Are you all right?|- Yeah, I'm OK.
{57318}{57371}|- You got it?|- It's no big deal.
{57372}{57453}|- What happened?|- She fell.
{57455}{57579}|This is so embarrassing.|I missed a step. It was totally my fault.
{57580}{57643}|- Please, you've all gotta stop.|- Are you sure?
{57644}{57742}|- It's not bleeding now.|- You poor thing. Merry Christmas.
{57744}{57803}|- Merry Christmas.|- Amy, hurry.
{57805}{57902}|- These are, like, a million years old.|- What took you so long?
{57904}{57970}|Amy. The mean sister.
{57972}{58022}|You got that right.
{58024}{58098}|And you're with Thad, right?
{58100}{58193}|- Yes, I'm Patrick. Merry Christmas.|- Here.
{58246}{58314}|Let me help you.|Why don't we go to the bathroom?
{58316}{58378}|What a great kid. Perfect for Ben.
{58728}{58811}|- You're kidding.|- Strata, for tomorrow.
{58812}{58940}|Meredith, what am I doing here?|You're cooking. Everything is fine now.
{58941}{59008}|What did you have me come for?
{59032}{59133}|Well, they certainly like you, don't they?
{59280}{59396}|Julie, why don't you tell us|a little bit about what it is you do?
{59431}{59500}|Me? I review artists' grants proposals.
{59501}{59604}|- At the Rockefeller Foundation.|- Well, Ben is a documentary film editor.
{59607}{59711}|Yeah, and Amy's a teacher|and Dad's an architect, so what?
{59713}{59785}|- Are you in New York?|- San Francisco.
{59787}{59915}|- Actually, I live in Berkeley.|- You know, I wasn't speaking for you.
{59916}{59983}|Well, you know...
{60052}{60116}|Grandma signed something really, really bad.
{60119}{60192}|Tattletale. I saw what Grandma signed.
{60194}{60251}|Way to go. Nice signage. Nice.
{60253}{60328}|So how is it that you and Everett never met?
{60331}{60415}|Well, Julie's impossible.|She's been traveling all year.
{60559}{60641}|- Can I be excused?|- OK. Why don't you go put your p.j.'s on?
{60692}{60798}|- Elizabeth. Come back. Come back.|- So, your being deaf...
{60801}{60944}|Actually, we were amazed by how little issue|the agency had over the whole hearing thing.
{60946}{61002}|They had more questions|about us as a couple.
{61004}{61048}|And about money.
{61050}{61150}|This may be personal, but do you have|a preference about the child's race?
{61152}{61212}|Julie.
{61214}{61289}|- I'd like a black baby.|- Don't you already have one?
{61292}{61355}|- Can you dig it?|- I'm so sorry. I...
{61356}{61451}|No, it totally doesn't matter to us.
{61453}{61523}|I was just wondering.
{61550}{61594}|Julie.
{61607}{61710}|We're just so excited|about having this child at all.
{61868}{61988}|I'm sorry. I would sign,|but I don't know the language.
{61990}{62044}|It's OK.
{62085}{62142}|Do you believe in nature versus nurture?
{62144}{62229}|Is that all a concern|in terms of bringing a child into your house?
{62231}{62320}|- Not sure I follow you.|- Why wouldn't we bring it into the house?
{62322}{62385}|Well, I just mean the gay thing.
{62387}{62470}|I mean, there's no irrefutable evidence|one way or the other.
{62472}{62595}|They think they've isolated a gene, but|they don't know what it's for or what it does.
{62597}{62693}|- Isn't it for window treatments?|- There you go.
{62695}{62777}|One contributing factor to being gay|may be the environment.
{62780}{62860}|Well, I mean, look at my drapes, right?|Aren't they horrible?
{62862}{62923}|There's no way it was this environment.
{62925}{63045}|Meredith, most of us here believe|that sexual orientation is the result
{63047}{63143}|of a genetic predisposition,|much like handedness.
{63146}{63253}|- Handedness?|- That and Mom. She tried to make us all gay.
{63255}{63329}|What are you talking about?|I didn't try, Everett.
{63331}{63402}|No, true, I did hope.
{63404}{63533}|I did desperately hope that|you would all be gay - all my boys,
{63535}{63615}|and then you'd never leave me.|I'm so sorry by the way, girls.
{63616}{63657}|Right.
{63659}{63725}|Sybil asked me when I was eight if I was gay.
{63727}{63883}|- Se asked all of us that.|- Yeah. Stop pretending you're so special.
{63895}{63975}|Ben, are you sure that you're not gay?
{63977}{64048}|I'm here, I'm queer, get used to it.
{64079}{64200}|I gave up hope on Ben years ago.
{64202}{64349}|You didn't really... You didn't really hope|for gay children, did you?
{64398}{64538}|Well, I don't think that anyone wishes for that.
{64560}{64659}|- Meredith.|- No, sorry. Please don't misunderstand me.
{64660}{64748}|I don't... Well, I mean...|All I mean to say is I just...
{64750}{64902}|I just don't think any parent would hope|for a child to be challenged like that.
{64905}{64996}|- I'm sorry. I didn't hear a word.|- Sorry. This isn't coming out right.
{64998}{65103}|All I'm trying to say is that... What I mean|to say is life is hard enough as it is,
{65104}{65254}|and it seems to me that you wouldn't want|to make it any more difficult for your child.
{65256}{65367}|I mean, Patrick. Patrick, you must understand|what I'm trying to say, right?
{65369}{65449}|- What did she say?|- Well, now, boss,
{65451}{65524}|I think we have been hit twice.
{65527}{65605}|No. No. No, I'm sorry.
{65607}{65664}|I did not mean that. Honestly.
{65665}{65760}|Why don't you try saying|what it is you do mean?
{65832}{65882}|Everett.
{65968}{66031}|All right, that's enough.
{66112}{66160}|I'm sorry.
{66161}{66209}|Well, that's enough.
{66212}{66285}|I just think any parent|would want a normal child.
{66287}{66345}|- Goddamn you!|- Sybil.
{66348}{66447}|- Don't "Sybil" me.|- For the child, to make it easier for the child.
{66449}{66504}|That's enough!
{66640}{66686}|- That's enough.|- Dad.
{66688}{66745}|It's too much, Everett. That's enough.
{66747}{66799}|Excuse me.
{66861}{66930}|Meredith. Meredith.
{66932}{66989}|Thanks a lot.
{67185}{67259}|I know how she can seem.
{67295}{67323}|You.
{67558}{67631}|I love you.
{67676}{67783}|And you are more normal
{67786}{67907}|than any other asshole sitting at this table.
{67963}{68010}|OK?
{68057}{68103}|OK.
{68128}{68183}|I need a fork.
{68208}{68263}|- There you go.|- Thanks, Ben.
{68301}{68351}|Is she OK?
{68353}{68422}|How would you feel?
{69058}{69107}|Amy, not funny.
{69110}{69187}|- I'm gonna go see...|- I got her. I got her. Excuse me.
{69312}{69385}|Excuse me. I've lost my appetite.
{69387}{69443}|Everett.
{70283}{70347}|What seems to be the problem here, ma'am?
{70708}{70756}|OK.
{70758}{70824}|Come on. Move over.
{70884}{70947}|I know where we can go.
{71110}{71159}|Any luck?
{71340}{71426}|- I'm gonna go look for 'em.|- Everett, take our car.
{71428}{71518}|Wait, I'm coming with you.|Can we finish this later?
{71520}{71585}|Here you go.
{71588}{71637}|Let's go.
{71856}{71917}|She's not in her room.
{71920}{71983}|Excuse me.|Are you sure there are no messages?
{71986}{72029}|Sorry.
{72032}{72091}|Where would he have taken her?
{72121}{72179}|- Thanks, Gus.|- Sure, Ben.
{72181}{72239}|- Have a lemon.|- Yeah.
{72466}{72524}|I am not a bad person.
{72552}{72622}|You're a total mess. Look at you.
{72648}{72702}|I am?
{72704}{72825}|I mean that in the best possible sense,|of course. You know that.
{72827}{72883}|I do?
{72932}{73007}|I love the gays.
{73009}{73057}|- Gay people.|- They know that.
{73060}{73200}|Then why?|I took her to the nicest restaurant I know,
{73202}{73269}|and she didn't say a word to me.
{73271}{73341}|Not one word. All evening.
{73343}{73393}|But I tried.
{73395}{73465}|And I try and I...
{73504}{73627}|- I would've slept on the couch.|- Maybe you should stop.
{73791}{73843}|Just stop.
{73844}{73939}|Stop trying, you know?
{73940}{74066}|It's exhausting,|trying to keep that lid screwed on so tight.
{74068}{74120}|Just...
{74224}{74296}|You know, relax.
{74491}{74555}|Try it.
{75051}{75124}|I'm not comfortable.
{75148}{75196}|OK.
{75250}{75306}|Here's the thing, Meredith.
{75432}{75505}|You have a freak flag.
{75569}{75630}|You just don't fly it.
{75780}{75918}|It was the first totem pole|to be raised in that community in 100 years,
{75920}{76012}|and it was just because this guy -
{76036}{76092}|I guess he was a fisherman -
{76094}{76190}|would wander around,|you know, from bar to bar,
{76192}{76291}|talking about how he had|this hole in his heart.
{76292}{76380}|That's how he put it.|He said he couldn't sleep.
{76383}{76515}|He would just lie there in bed|because of this hole in his heart.
{76597}{76731}|- Sorry. You don't even want to hear this.|- No. No, no. Tell me. Tell me.
{76734}{76777}|Well...
{76804}{76939}|The community got together|and they found the guy a log.
{76980}{77115}|The guy had never carved a thing before|in his life. It took him five years.
{77117}{77290}|I flew there for the raising and it was|just this tiny, tiny island off of the coast.
{77336}{77396}|The whole town was there.
{77422}{77483}|It was...
{77485}{77552}|It was incredible.
{77555}{77665}|You just couldn't look at it without crying.
{77684}{77759}|I'd love to see that.
{77760}{77804}|Well,
{77807}{77871}|it's there for you.
{78160}{78203}|Ben.
{78204}{78284}|- Ben Stone.|- Holy crow. Brad.
{78286}{78325}|- How are you?|- Good.
{78328}{78433}|- Merry Christmas. You remember David?|- Yeah. Hey, Dave. Happy holidays.
{78436}{78499}|So what's going on?|Are you working tonight?
{78502}{78586}|- Yeah. Just got off.|- Are you here with Amy?
{78588}{78653}|No, no, I was just kind of... I was...
{78655}{78723}|Well, this is Meredith. Meredith Morton.
{78725}{78803}|Brad Stevenson, David Silver.|We went to school together.
{78804}{78861}|Meredith's Everett's...
{78864}{78952}|Meredith and Everett, they're, well...
{78954}{79008}|Hold the phone.
{79010}{79070}|Brad?
{79072}{79132}|Brad Stevenson?
{79182}{79216}|My God.
{79218}{79310}|Aren't you the guy that popped Amy's cherry?
{79337}{79393}|- Do I know you?|- This is too good.
{79396}{79455}|Let me buy you a drink. What do you say?
{79458}{79514}|- You too. What was your name?|- David.
{79516}{79642}|That's what I'm gonna do.|I am gonna buy you boys some beers.
{79644}{79695}|Everyone in here. Bartender?
{79697}{79795}|I would like to buy a round for the house.
{79806}{79846}|Coming right up.
{79866}{79961}|- Do you feel like you chose?|- What do you mean?
{79963}{80028}|Chose your life.
{80030}{80175}|Said, "This is the thing I'm gonna do.|These are the things I want."
{80176}{80245}|Not necessarily because|you were good at this thing
{80247}{80368}|or because everybody told you that|that's what you should want,
{80371}{80455}|because everybody said that's who you were.
{80536}{80625}|I don't know.|I mean, like this artists' grants work,
{80628}{80718}|how did you know that's the thing|you were gonna be passionate about?
{80720}{80814}|- Who said I was passionate about it?|- No, no, don't do that.
{80817}{80884}|Don’t joke.
{80897}{81059}|You know, I've been thinking about|his monastery I missed seeing in Hong Kong.
{81062}{81115}|Like that's an important thing.
{81117}{81175}|Then you should go.
{81227}{81300}|I want to go to Alaska.
{81303}{81372}|I do. I wanna see that totem pole.
{81373}{81492}|I wanna see that thing that felt|like a hole in the centre of that guy.
{81494}{81594}|That thing he needed to make|just so he could sleep.
{81676}{81777}|That's my song. Finally, my song.
{82153}{82236}|Brad, dance with me.
{82238}{82294}|You better do what she says, Brad.
{82305}{82414}|Come on, Brad. Dance with me.
{82834}{82895}|So, Brad, listen.
{82897}{82978}|You tell me. I don't know what I did to her.
{82980}{83032}|I don't know what I said.
{83034}{83131}|Well, I haven't seen Amy in over a year.|I'm not really sure if I can hel...
{83133}{83224}|You haven't seen her in over a year?
{83226}{83321}|Well, how are you gonna get her, Brad?
{83323}{83409}|How do you think|you're gonna get her like that?
{83411}{83515}|- I don't even know if she wants to see me.|- Of course she does.
{83516}{83590}|Look, Brad, I like you.
{83592}{83684}|You should come tomorrow.|It's Christmas, I'm making breakfast.
{83685}{83746}|I'm inviting you.
{83748}{83800}|You come over.
{83802}{83884}|- Do you guys want another beer?|- Yeah. Wait.
{83946}{84063}|You know what would be great? You know|what would be the most perfect thing now?
{84113}{84252}|If we could figure out how to get a little pot.
{84260}{84350}|- Maybe they went back to the house.|- Do you wanna get some coffee?
{84352}{84444}|- No.|- I don't know, get some coffee or something.
{84539}{84589}|I just...
{84592}{84642}|I thought...
{84697}{84741}|It's funny.
{84792}{84855}|- What is?|- This.
{84966}{85013}|Everett.
{85015}{85081}|You know, I...
{85101}{85155}|I can't.
{85226}{85287}|So...
{85289}{85365}|Good night. Good night.
{85892}{85939}|Mr. Stone.
{85940}{86081}|No, it's Kelly. Please, Julie.|I don't mean to bother you. Is Meredith here?
{86084}{86146}|No, she hasn't shown up yet.
{86172}{86264}|Because I wanted to apologize to her.
{86267}{86379}|And I'd like to apologize to you also.
{86569}{86607}|Everett?
{86756}{86810}|Honey, look, I...
{86858}{86899}|I'm sorry.
{86912}{87015}|- I'm... I really am...|- I'm not really sure I believe that.
{87027}{87075}|Everett.
{87122}{87171}|Everett?
{87380}{87487}|- So what was that dream?|- Which?
{87490}{87572}|You told me you had a dream about me|but you didn't finish.
{87574}{87635}|You didn't say what I was doing.
{87736}{87818}|You were shoveling snow.
{87820}{87895}|I... What?
{87897}{88011}|You were just a little girl|in a flannel nightgown
{88012}{88146}|and you were shoveling snow|from the walk in front of our house.
{88221}{88273}|And I was the snow.
{88276}{88349}|I was the snow,
{88351}{88459}|and everywhere it landed|and everything it covered.
{88461}{88510}|You scooped me up.
{88660}{88746}|With a big red shovel.
{88748}{88819}|You scooped me up.
{89422}{89463}|What?
{89497}{89556}|Nothing.
{89871}{89916}|Everybody asleep?
{89919}{89961}|OK, but...
{89963}{90026}|At 4:30. Right.
{90302}{90398}|- Hi.|- Daddy's here. John says hi.
{90400}{90459}|- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
{90638}{90692}|She's nice like this, isn't she?
{90856}{90905}|All right.
{90908}{91018}|- I'm going to bed.|- OK. I'm gonna go too.
{91019}{91089}|So we'll see you tomorrow, then?
{91091}{91186}|Merry Christmas. I love you too.
{91228}{91342}|- Are you coming up?|- Are you kidding? This is my favorite part.
{91431}{91491}|Merry Christmas,
{91493}{91557}|my Susannah.
{91559}{91618}|Merry Christmas, Daddy.
{91907}{91975}|...pretty proud of you.
{91977}{92044}|It's our last dance in St Louis.
{92046}{92116}|I feel like I'm gonna cry.
{92766}{92817}|Hi, there.
{92843}{92916}|Well, hello.
{92918}{92967}|Hello.
{93068}{93130}|You need a haircut.
{93203}{93277}|You should see how mad he is at me.
{93347}{93408}|It's not her.
{93410}{93463}|You know, honey.
{93465}{93511}|It's not her.
{93513}{93595}|I feel sorry for her.
{93598}{93715}|I do. It's just that he's making this mistake.
{93759}{93811}|And I won't be here.
{93956}{94030}|I only want him to be happy.
{94104}{94159}|He'll be fine.
{94232}{94292}|We all will.
{94294}{94358}|No matter what.
{94384}{94439}|You'll see.
{94513}{94570}|I'm scared.
{94595}{94651}|Kelly.
{94652}{94694}|Kelly,
{94695}{94757}|I'm scared.
{98400}{98519}|- Merry Christmas, Granddaughter.|- Merry Christmas, Grandpa.
{98521}{98608}|- Just stockings.|- Just stockings.
{99301}{99350}|Ben?
{99376}{99436}|My God.
{99438}{99485}|- Ben.|- God.
{99487}{99544}|My God. My God.
{99617}{99667}|Ben?
{99807}{99896}|I'm sorry. I was...|I was looking for Ben.
{100219}{100282}|Well, my car's back.
{100283}{100353}|Merry Christmas.
{100603}{100670}|Don't be a jerk. I just said Merry Christmas.
{100672}{100734}|Dad put you up to this.
{100774}{100832}|You and I need to get something straight.
{100834}{100901}|Here we go.
{100904}{100958}|Not now, Kelly.
{100959}{101045}|- Right, OK.|- Jesus, Kelly. Not now.
{101047}{101101}|Yeah. Fine. Hey, Everett.
{101246}{101340}|You've had a charmed life, kid.|I blame myself.
{101343}{101433}|Mom, you've never|made anybody's life easier.
{101435}{101526}|- What the hell do you know about it?|- I know a little.
{101784}{101842}|I'm sick, honey.
{101969}{102034}|And you can't fix it.
{102104}{102166}|Not even by getting married.
{102339}{102418}|- Mom.|- What?
{102683}{102791}|I know this is probably a tall order,|but I need you to do me a favor
{102793}{102933}|and try not to be so perfect, all right?
{102935}{103005}|I'm far from perfect.
{103057}{103202}|I'd hate to see you miss out on something|because you have this picture in your mind
{103204}{103314}|or you thought you could|change something you can't.
{103315}{103415}|I'd hate to see you|not find what you really want.
{103484}{103545}|But, Everett,
{103593}{103651}|it's your ring.
{103707}{103776}|It's your decision.
{103778}{103823}|I'll find it.
{103841}{103876}|Julie.
{103934}{103991}|I was just getting coffee. I'm sorry.
{103992}{104037}|No, wait. Julie.
{104039}{104094}|My God.
{104097}{104151}|God.
{104315}{104386}|Hey, there you are.
{104397}{104458}|How'd you sleep?
{104459}{104518}|OK?
{104788}{104869}|- It's beautiful.|- Yeah.
{104944}{105000}|- Try it on.|- What?
{105002}{105088}|- Yeah, just try it on. I want to see if it fits.|- No.
{105091}{105174}|- Come on. Here.|- No. My hands are bigger than Meredith's.
{105177}{105235}|- Julie, I want to see.|- Isn't that bad luck?
{105236}{105332}|- Yeah, it's very bad luck.|- Sybil, is now a better time for you?
{105334}{105396}|No.
{105529}{105578}|Wow.
{105617}{105691}|That really is beautiful.
{105965}{106043}|- OK, Everett, what's going on?|- Julie.
{106044}{106130}|It's a beautiful ring, Everett. I...
{106167}{106223}|- Oh, no. OK.|- Just a sec.
{106225}{106297}|- No, no, no. We'll just get a little soap.|- I can't...
{106299}{106347}|Where'd everybody go?
{106350}{106420}|- I wanna open some presents. Come on.|- My God.
{106423}{106493}|- Is it stuck?|- Well, yeah. Yes. Of course it's stuck.
{106495}{106565}|- I told you. My hands are bigger.|- What's stuck?
{106567}{106645}|- Butter. That's it.|- Let's get this show on the road.
{106647}{106690}|- She can't get it off.|- What?
{106691}{106754}|- Grandma's ring.|- I'm not doing this on purpose.
{106756}{106848}|- I didn't say that.|- I hate to say this, but please be careful.
{106850}{106908}|- Is she all right?|- I'm fine.
{106930}{107026}|- Meredith, wait a second. Meredith.|- How dare you?
{107028}{107083}|Meredith, wait a second.
{107085}{107149}|Are we opening presents or what?
{107199}{107279}|- Why's she crying?|- I'm not crying.
{107281}{107347}|Am I?
{107349}{107431}|- Julie. Julie.|- Julie. Julie.
{107434}{107491}|Meredith.
{107493}{107554}|- Where have you been?|- I just got here.
{107556}{107617}|- Julie, are you all right?|- Julie?
{107619}{107686}|- What's she doing? Let me in.|- Meredith.
{107688}{107736}|- Meredith.|- Julie.
{107738}{107840}|- What is all the racket?|- All right, Amy.
{107951}{107995}|- Morning.|- Morning.
{107998}{108073}|- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
{108145}{108195}|- What are you doing?|- Meredith.
{108197}{108261}|What?
{108307}{108398}|- What's that?|- It's your wedding ring.
{108435}{108509}|- My God!|- All right, let's give them a little room.
{108511}{108558}|Come on, let's go. Let's go.
{108573}{108673}|- He's gonna propose?|- Yeah. If I can get it off.
{108675}{108771}|- What are you doing with my wedding ring?|- It stuck. He wanted to see it on.
{108774}{108848}|Why did he want to see it on you?
{108891}{108961}|Where were you last night?
{109043}{109153}|- I can't tell you.|- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
{109328}{109393}|No. Meredith.
{109395}{109434}|No.
{109437}{109498}|You didn't.
{109500}{109547}|I'm so ashamed.
{109549}{109611}|Jesus, Kelly, what? What did I do?
{109613}{109676}|I'm gonna be watching you, mister. Yeah.
{109679}{109753}|How'd she end up with the ring on|in the first place?
{109755}{109819}|Well... You know, I...
{109859}{109920}|Now, who the hell is that?
{109935}{110027}|Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy,|Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy.
{110028}{110074}|Amy.
{110191}{110274}|Amy. Merry Christmas.
{110375}{110410}|Brad.
{110412}{110471}|Brad, what are you doing here?
{110472}{110543}|Meredith invited me.
{110545}{110639}|- It's terrible. Don't you think I know?|- Why did you bring me here?
{110640}{110703}|Don't yell at me. I needed my sister.
{110705}{110761}|Meredith, how could you?
{110763}{110851}|I know. I know.
{110940}{111012}|Let me see the ring again.
{111129}{111159}|That's it?
{111171}{111274}|- What do you think this is?|- All right. Is Meredith out of the can yet?
{111276}{111323}|What is it, Amy?
{111325}{111365}|- Brad.|- Brad.
{111367}{111412}|What's up, Ben?
{111433}{111510}|Merry Christmas.|I got a letter from your mother.
{111513}{111563}|- She loves you.|- Merry Christmas.
{111566}{111611}|Mr. Stone.
{111622}{111738}|Hi, merry Christmas to you guys too.|I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
{111740}{111829}|No. Here she is. Meredith, you know Brad.
{111867}{111921}|My God. I totally forgot.
{111923}{112048}|Maybe you would like to share with us|how it is that you know Brad.
{112050}{112132}|We were all at O'Malley's last night.
{112157}{112247}|- You were at O'Malley's?|- Hound's-tooth, right? Hound's-tooth?
{112249}{112306}|- Filene's Basement.|- Really?
{112307}{112358}|- Meredith...|- Let's open presents.
{112360}{112451}|- Presents? Don't you think we should talk?|- Me next. Me next.
{112454}{112478}|Amy.
{112480}{112563}|I have something for everyone.
{112718}{112768}|It's for you.
{112829}{112887}|Everett.
{112918}{112997}|For everyone. Wow. For me? Thank you.
{113063}{113128}|Amy.
{113131}{113169}|Susannah.
{113382}{113437}|Well, open them.
{113439}{113490}|Oh, yeah.
{113493}{113604}|It's so beautifully wrapped|that I almost feel bad.
{113606}{113669}|It's for you.
{113915}{113991}|I found the original on Everett's desk.
{113993}{114062}|I just thought it was so beautiful.
{114310}{114376}|That's you and me, kid.
{114435}{114494}|You and me.
{114578}{114637}|I'm...
{114639}{114705}|I'm sorry. I just... I...
{114730}{114799}|I just assumed that it was Everett.
{114893}{114987}|- Thank you very much.|- Meredith.
{114989}{115038}|You did good.
{115064}{115145}|Meredith, I'm...
{115250}{115315}|- We've got to...|- I know what you're gonna ask.
{115316}{115366}|That's my point, I don't think you do.
{115375}{115419}|Brad, you look hungry. I'm just...
{115421}{115465}|- Will you?|- Please.
{115467}{115596}|- Will you please stop talking?|- No. Everett. Everett, no, I will not marry you.
{115632}{115701}|What?
{115762}{115819}|I'm sorry, Everett.
{115854}{115929}|I can't marry you.
{115964}{116009}|I...
{116011}{116076}|I didn't ask you.
{116115}{116194}|- You... What?|- You said...
{116299}{116353}|I'm not asking you to marry me.
{116355}{116436}|You're not? You didn't...
{116748}{116834}|That's just great, isn't it?
{116859}{116938}|It's just perfect.
{116940}{117038}|- Like I haven't been humiliated enough.|- Meredith, it's not...
{117040}{117110}|It's not?
{117111}{117251}|This isn't exactly the moment you've all|been waiting for? You all hate me so much.
{117252}{117352}|- Meredith, that's not true.|- I know what you see.
{117354}{117491}|Meredith the spoiled, crazy,
{117492}{117617}|racist bigot bitch from Bedford, right?
{117619}{117677}|That's what you all think.
{117680}{117787}|That is. That's what you all see|when you look at me.
{117822}{117899}|Not good enough for Everett.
{117901}{118003}|Not like all of you. She comes|all the way up here to ruin our Christmas
{118005}{118086}|and then she sleeps with his brother.
{118187}{118237}|What?
{118302}{118361}|I slept with your brother.
{118363}{118430}|- You slept with who?|- "With whom?"
{118461}{118546}|- Do not look at me.|- With Ben. I slept with Ben.
{118547}{118661}|Excuse me. Could you just back up|for a minute there? Everett, we did not...
{118663}{118772}|- What's the use?|- Meredith, we did not sleep together.
{118885}{118952}|- We didn't?|- No.
{119062}{119154}|Isn't there anybody that loves me?
{119383}{119434}|- Nice.|- Who? Me?
{119437}{119476}|Yeah, you.
{119877}{119931}|- My God.|- Meredith.
{119985}{120090}|OK, Everett, look, I...|I just want you to know that...
{120149}{120273}|My God. No, no, it's all right, sweetie.|Let's just get this off. You'll be fine.
{120275}{120355}|- Watch your pretty hair.|- I'm just as good as any of you.
{120357}{120435}|Of course you are. Better, probably.
{120471}{120503}|Ben.
{120505}{120546}|- I'm gonna get...|- Everett.
{120575}{120624}|Everett, Everett. Come on.
{120670}{120731}|Sorry, I don't know if we've met. I'm Brad.
{120733}{120800}|- Julie.|- Somebody's gonna get hurt.
{120802}{120935}|- What's so great about you guys?|- Nothing. It's just that we're all we've got.
{120937}{121027}|- We're not so great.|- And you. You're the worst.
{121028}{121093}|I'm the w...
{121095}{121176}|- Nothing happened. Nothing happened.|- Come on, stop. Stop.
{121178}{121265}|- Stop chasing me. I didn't do anything.|- Everett. Boys. Boys.
{121267}{121383}|- Why does she think she slept with you?|- Well, we were kind of wasted.
{121444}{121502}|Stop this nonsense.
{121575}{121623}|Boy.
{121687}{121731}|Everett.
{121823}{121890}|Everett, stop. Not the ja...
{121891}{121960}|Not the jacket. Not on the jacket.
{122059}{122127}|- Are you OK, Everett?|- How could you do that to me?
{122129}{122203}|I didn't do a... I didn't do anything to you.
{122205}{122308}|She was passed out. I slept on...|I slept on the floor. Nothing happened.
{122311}{122362}|This is a brand-new...
{122364}{122476}|Look, you don't even love her, man.|You don't love her.
{123062}{123118}|Kelly.
{123119}{123179}|Are you OK?
{123204}{123290}|To Bedford. Yes. OK.
{123291}{123383}|At 5:30. And that's from campus?
{123442}{123535}|OK. You too. Merry Christmas.
{124851}{124916}|- I'm sorry, Everett.|- No.
{124919}{124984}|I'm sorry for everything.
{125047}{125113}|You don't hate me, do you?
{125136}{125174}|No.
{125254}{125312}|Of course not.
{125639}{125712}|Was this for me?
{125793}{125872}|- Elizabeth, did you see Julie?|- No.
{125875}{125963}|Elizabeth, where did you get that ring?
{125981}{126029}|Elizabeth?
{126031}{126165}|She said to give it to Everett.|She said to say goodbye.
{126254}{126324}|It's not a clock radio.
{126715}{126754}|Wow, Brad.
{126937}{127015}|- Where's he going?|- Who?
{127239}{127309}|Where are they going?
{127387}{127446}|What?
{127721}{127773}|Get in.
{129167}{129218}|A pair.
{129459}{129536}|What do you say|you get out of these clothes?
{129657}{129723}|You smell a little like puke.
{129829}{129891}|- Think he's found her?|- I don't know.
{129936}{129979}|- Have you seen her?|- No.
{129981}{130042}|A guy in there said...
{130424}{130472}|Julie.
{130796}{130848}|You didn't even say goodbye.
{130850}{130908}|You were a little busy.
{130944}{130993}|Well,
{130995}{131049}|my bus is here.

{133325}{133397}|- Julie.|- Everett, I...
{133399}{133441}|Julie.
{133443}{133557}|I just wanted to ask|if you were doing anything for New Year's.
