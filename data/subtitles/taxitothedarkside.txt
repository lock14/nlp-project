1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:35:42,623
The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions. The D. C. Circuit dismissed Hamdan’s challenge in this regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections. Neither of these grounds is persuasive... Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2006

2
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:50,873
On December first, 2002 ...

3
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:58,554
Dilawar, a young Afghan taxi driver, took three passengers for a ride.

4
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:05,274
He never returned home.

5
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:16,914
TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE

6
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:37,181
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] When the sun started to go down, the sand started blowing.

7
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,943
It was like a big dust bowl. And I'm thinking,

8
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,713
"Boy, is it gonna be like this every night?"

9
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,556
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram] I remember walking in to there for the first time:

10
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,666
The smell...the smell is the first thing that hits you,

11
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:52,462
And being from D.C., if you've ever been to the National Zoo

12
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:58,553
When you walk into the elephant house there, that's the best way to describe it.

13
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:02,393
There were a few of us that lived in the prison, and I was one of them.

14
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:07,594
They built it up to be a big, scary place to the prisoners.

15
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:24,193
After the invasion of Afghanistan, U.S. Forces occupied Bagram,

16
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:29,273
An old Soviet airbase as a place to collect and interrogate thousands of detainees

17
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:32,393
captured throughout Afgan and Pakistan.

18
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:35,473
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] These were suspected Taliban.

19
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:42,321
They were being caught by Special Forces throughout the countryside, brought to Bagram to be held,

20
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:47,753
interrogated, determined if they were a high-value prisoner.

21
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:51,593
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] These were not nice people at all.

22
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:57,233
They were very evil people who, you know, definitely had violent intentions.

23
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,833
On December 5, 2002 ...

24
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:03,833
Dilawar, the taxi driver, was brought to Bagram.

25
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:08,953
He was designed a PUC: Person Under Control, No. 421.

26
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:13,513
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] He was something to do with a trigger man for a rocket attack.

27
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:17,833
And that's about all I know.

28
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:23,794
Five days after his arrival, he was dead.

29
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:34,153
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I would say this was around about 05:00 in the morning.

30
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:38,268
As I walked by Dilawar...I think that's his name, Dilawar

31
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:39,953
Walked by Dilawar's cell,

32
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:43,753
I noticed that he was just kind of hanging there with his head down.

33
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:49,633
But he was being too still to be, you know, just hanging there and sleep.

34
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:53,633
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] SGT. Curtis opened up the door, and we went in.

35
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:57,313
He was unresponsive. And we started CPR.

36
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,753
[PFC. Willie Brand, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I was downstairs in general population.

37
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,393
Then I heard a call come in asking for Cammack to come upstairs.

38
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:07,599
He was a medic, and we carried him downstairs on a stretcher.

39
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,460
And the Cammack was still on top of him while we're carrying him down, still trying to get him back going,

40
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,645
all the way down the stairs. We got him through the front door and they kept working on him,

41
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:21,394
kept working on him until the doctor got there and pronounced him dead.

42
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:25,913
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I don't know if it was an injury that was aggravated by something,

43
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:29,193
or whether he was just sick coming in.

44
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,593
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram & Abu Ghraib] They are very frail people,

45
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:36,793
And I was surprised that it had taken that long for one of them to die in our custody.

46
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:41,633
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] There was a definite sense of concern, because he was the second one.

47
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:46,913
Just a week before Dilawar's death, another detainee at Bagram had died.

48
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,489
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] You know, you wonder: Is this something we did?

49
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:52,913
Or did somebody kill him or something? But I just didn't know.

50
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:57,873
According to the medical examiner, the first detainee to die, Habibullah,

51
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,553
had a preexisting pulmonary condition.

52
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:05,633
But it was the beatings he sustained at Bagram that led to the cause of his death:

53
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:08,873
A bloodclot that traveled to his lungs.

54
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,985
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram & Abu Ghraib] When the second one died a week later,

55
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:14,673
That's when it was like, "Oh, crap! Something's going to happen now."

56
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,353
That's two prisoners dying within a week of each other. That's bad.

57
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:26,273
A preliminary investigation into Dilawar's death, revealed deep bruises all over his body.

58
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:30,393
But it did not conclude that his treatment at Bagram was to blame.

59
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:35,156
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] The next day, they said, "Draw out how he was shackled up here."

60
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:39,433
And I made that crude drawing.

61
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:44,553
The ceiling of these isolation rooms was just a simple metal grate,

62
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:49,793
And it was thick enough you could put handcuffs, you know, through the wires of that ...

63
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:55,154
[Military Investigation Reenactment] And you just kind of chain them up like that, out to the sides, like this.

64
00:06:56,634 --> 00:07:03,473
Forced standing for long periods had inflamed tissue damage from blows to Dilawar's legs.

65
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:08,593
But the initial Bagram press release failed to mention overhead shackling and beatings.

66
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:14,034
It declared that both detainees had died of natural causes.

67
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:24,791
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] My opinion is that the military wanted to get this over,

68
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:30,394
and get this done quickly, before it really got noticed.

69
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:35,393
Soon after Dilawar's death, the officer in charge of interrogation at Bagram,

70
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:40,993
Captain Carolyn Wood, was awarded the bronze star for valor.

71
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:45,113
Following the Iraq invasion, Wood and her intelligence unit,

72
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:47,753
were given a new assignment:

73
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:50,273
Abu Ghraib.

74
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:56,154
A FEW BAD APPLES

75
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,473
[Eric Lahammer, Mil-Intel, Bagram & Abu Ghraib] The only thing I can really remember about Abu Ghraib was the heat.

76
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:12,393
It was like 148 degrees(58 ° C) or so there and it was all concrete.

77
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:18,793
Abu Ghraib also had the infamous torture chambers and stuff left from Saddam's era.

78
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:23,259
I remember walking through those and seeing like fingernail marks on the walls,

79
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,149
And bloodstains, and guillotines and stuff like that.

80
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,308
It was a pretty surreal feeling.

81
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:38,264
We went to Abu Ghraib, I believe in July. July or August of 2003 to start that prison.

82
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:45,714
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram & Abu Ghraib] You put people in crazy situations, and people do crazy things.

83
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:48,233
And Abu was getting mortared every night.

84
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:51,313
These 120 mm. mortars killing prisoners.

85
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:56,153
The first time that happened, they should have evacuated those prisoners to somewhere else,

86
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:59,433
Because the prisoners weren't safe.

87
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:03,433
[SGT. Ken Davis, 372nd MP Company, Abu Ghraib] People were being told to rough up Iraqis that wouldn't cooperate.

88
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:06,793
We were also told that they were nothing but dogs.

89
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:11,153
Then, all of a sudden, you start looking at these people as less than human.

90
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:14,073
And you start doing things to them you would never dream of.

91
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:18,194
And that's where it got scary.

92
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:27,193
[US Chief of Staff, Richard Myers] It was only the night shift. There's always a few bad apples.

93
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:29,433
[Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense] It's been a body blow for all of us.

94
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,273
[Lt. General Ricardo S. Sanchez] This is clearly an isolated incident.

95
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:38,713
[General Geoffrey D. Miller] The conduct of a very, very small number of our leaders and soldiers.

96
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:42,073
In the wake of media attention surrounding Abu Ghraib,

97
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,873
the military began a series of investigations.

98
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:48,753
[Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Abu Ghraib, 2004] The people who engaged in abuses will be brought to justice.

99
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,793
The world will see how a free system, a democratic system,

100
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:58,473
functions and operates transparently with no cover-ups.

101
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,433
[Rear Admiral John Hutson, (ret) Judge Advocate General] The Secretary and others have said,

102
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,833
"Well, you know, we've conducted 12 investigations"...

103
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:07,473
Each and all of which were geared to looking downward,

104
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:13,034
Down toward Lynndie England and Graner, and not looking up.

105
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:23,593
The soldiers in the photos are military police, or MPs, whose job it was to guard and protect the prisoners.

106
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:28,073
In their statements, the MPs claimed that Mil-Intel, or MI,

107
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:34,273
Ordered them to weaken, humiliate, and break the prisoners for interrogation purposes.

108
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,953
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Mil-Intel, Iraq] Obviously, you know, what they were doing, in those pictures,

109
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:39,913
was not sanctioned by the Interrogation Rules of Engagement.

110
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:44,433
And they weren't interrogators. So yes, I did think that they were bad apples.

111
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:49,633
However, I also think that they were taking cues from Intel.

112
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:52,313
[SGT. Ken Davis, 372nd MP Company, Abu Ghraib] This reading report said it was happening in Afgan.

113
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:56,205
I mean, humiliation, trying to break people came from somewhere.

114
00:10:56,205 --> 00:11:01,073
MPs didn't think of it. MPs were not ever trained in such things.

115
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:05,193
We should never have been "breaking" anybody.

116
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:08,873
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram & Abu Ghraib] I can tell you, we set the same policies in Abu as we set at Bagram.

117
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:12,313
The same exact rules.

118
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:15,994
The same thing was going on.

119
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:21,074
And they wonder why it happened.

120
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,593
In her sworn testimony about Abu Ghraib,

121
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:29,313
Capt. Wood said she felt pressured to produce intelligence,

122
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,713
So she brought unauthorized techniques:

123
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:38,593
Dogs, nudity, sleep deprivation and stress positions to Abu Ghraib from Afgan.

124
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:43,393
Wood maintained that the Bagram model had tacit approval from superiors.

125
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:48,873
But U.S. Central Command had never responded to her requests for authorization.

126
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:54,153
So the mystery remained. Was Abu Ghraib the work of a few bad apples?

127
00:11:54,154 --> 00:12:00,593
Or evidence of a new world-wide system of detention and interrogation?

128
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,553
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Mil-Intel, Iraq] I'm pretty sure that interrogators were telling the guards:

129
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:07,583
"Strip this guy naked, chain him up to the bed in an uncomfortable position,

130
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,753
You know, do whatever you can." And then they decided to take it one step further

131
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:16,674
And have some "fun," and take pictures.

132
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,274
[Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, Chief of Staff to Colin Powell 2002-2005, 31 years in the Military]

133
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:07,793
You've always got people in the military who are just this side of the Marquis De Sade,

134
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,132
And one of the reasons you want rules

135
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:16,833
And this code of conduct to help you lead mud rings and mud runs infantry...is

136
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:24,914
is so that you can use those tools to restrict this tendency in your soldiers.

137
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,233
When you have your friends dying on you left and right,

138
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:31,233
You can sometimes go beyond the pale.

139
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:36,256
So a lieutenant, a captain down where the rubber meets the road, needs these tools.

140
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:40,473
And he needs to be able to punish people who cross the line.

141
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:51,153
When the secretary walked through my door into my office

142
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:54,793
About the time the photos of Abu Ghraib were getting ready to come out

143
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,233
And we had rumor that they were coming out,

144
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:00,713
He said to me, "I need to know what happened and why."

145
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,864
And so then I began to build both an open source

146
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:08,233
And inside the government, classified and unclassified, document file.

147
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:11,485
And I began to see legal arguments as to why the President

148
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,793
could pretty much do anything he wanted to in the name of Security.

149
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:17,593
And the Secretary of Defense, and others beneath him,

150
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:22,913
were actually looking for the twin pressures that they put on people.

151
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,513
That is to say, the pressure to produce intelligence.

152
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,913
And the fact that they were saying "the gloves are off,"

153
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:34,394
Created the environment in the field that we later saw reflected in the photographs from Abu Ghraib.

154
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:40,817
And in my view, far more serious fashion than the photographs we saw,

155
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:44,580
Were 98 deaths of people in detention,

156
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,567
Which I understand now from my army colleagues is up to some 25

157
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:53,473
of which have been declared officially by the Army as homicides.

158
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:59,048
People say, "Well, these photographs from Abu Ghraib, they weren't real torture."

159
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:05,353
I look back at those people and say, "Murder is torture. Murder is the ultimate torture."

160
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:11,433
In the case of Dilawar, he was subject to certainly cruel and unusual punishment,

161
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:16,794
And ultimately, he was subject to torture because he died.

162
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:54,793
[Carlotta Gall] "First, we're not chaining people to the ceiling." That's what he says.

163
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:58,913
Carlotta Gall is a New York Times journalist based in Kabul.

164
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,793
Unsatisfied with the Military's explanation of the two deaths at Bagram,

165
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:06,594
She set out to investigate.

166
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,713
[Carlotta Gall] It took a long time to find the family because the Military didn't tell us who they were.

167
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,966
And we started calling around: Governors.

168
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:24,913
They are a very simple farming family. They don't speak English.

169
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:29,313
But they showed me a paper that was given to them with the body.

170
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:36,113
And that's when I opened it up and read it. It was in English.

171
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:40,953
And it was signed by a U.S. Major who was the pathologist.

172
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:44,793
And of the four boxes, she checked the box for Homicide.

173
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,050
I said, "My God, they've killed him."

174
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,684
And we then had to tell the family, "Do you know what's written here?"

175
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:55,393
And they said, "No, it's in English. We don't understand."

176
00:16:55,394 --> 00:17:02,274
And I think maybe the Red Cross who helped return the body had explained, but they hadn't taken it in.

177
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:08,273
And then the Pathologist had said it was this blunt force trauma to the legs.

178
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:27,636
[Carlotta Gall] "Presently have no indication of that." You know,

179
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:32,633
There's been a death certificate signed by his people and he says,

180
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,473
"Presently I have no indication of any blunt force trauma."

181
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:38,793
And it's written on the death certificate which I've seen.

182
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:42,798
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] The story probably would have gone away had it not been for my colleague, Carlotta Gall,

183
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:48,933
Who tracked down Dilawar's family and found the knife-in-the-back clue

184
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:56,553
That told everyone that this incident had been something other than the Military portrayed.

185
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:59,313
Tim Golden picked up the trail of the story

186
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:02,265
And obtained a confidential file of the Army investigation,

187
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:07,553
Including hundreds of pages of testimony from the soldiers involved.

188
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,673
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Part of what made the story compelling to me was that

189
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:13,058
You had these young soldiers with very little training or preparation,

190
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:18,833
thrown into this situation in the aftermath of 9/11, just as the rules were changing.

191
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,233
And they weren't told what the new rules were.

192
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,514
And you had this young Afghan man who came into this system

193
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:29,313
at the wrong time, in the wrong way. And this is what happened to him.

194
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:32,013
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I saw his picture in the New York Times article.

195
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:36,168
Before that picture, I couldn't have picked his face out, you know.

196
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:43,073
My memory of him was chained up, with the hood on, no sleeping.

197
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,553
Following questions raised by the New York Times,

198
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,153
And under scrutiny about the Abu Ghraib scandal,

199
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:52,793
The Army finally stepped up the Dilawar investigation,

200
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:59,113
And began charging soldiers with maltreatment, maiming and homicide.

201
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:02,072
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] When you're working, you know, with an organization like the Military,

202
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,980
You know, they are going to hold somebody accountable.

203
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,844
You can sweep some things under the rug, but, you know, this was a death.

204
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:11,353
There was two deaths. And okay, fine, they are going to charge people.

205
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:15,473
[SGT. Anthony Morden, 377th Mil-Pol Unit, Bagram, Afgan] It seemed like the Military, now after they got a black eye from Abu Ghraib,

206
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:21,073
wanted to get a public opinion that they were policing their soldiers. And so they said,

207
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:24,589
And so they said, "We had this incident that happened a couple of years ago.

208
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,913
We could still prosecute some of them."

209
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:30,322
[PFC. Willie Brand, 377th Mil-Pol Unit, Bagram, Afgan] I had nothing to do with the Military for two years,

210
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:33,953
And all of a sudden I'm getting a call saying that I'm being court-martialed.

211
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:36,713
I mean that was a huge surprise for me.

212
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:41,633
[John Galligan, Willie Brand's attorney] From a defense perspective, I immediately said "This is a political show trial."

213
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:45,873
Willie Brand is a good soldier. Good soldiers tend to obey orders.

214
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:50,633
Good soldiers tend to be people who do what they are trained to do.

215
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:55,393
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] The interrogators on the ground for the most part didn't know what the rules were.

216
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,553
They'd never been interrogators before.

217
00:19:57,554 --> 00:20:02,382
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram, Afgan] My interrogation training consisted basically of,

218
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:06,473
They taught us some approaches...you know...how to get people to talk.

219
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:10,844
And then..."Here, go watch these guys interrogate"...

220
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,913
which were the people that we were replacing...

221
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:17,993
For about five or six hours before I did my first interrogation.

222
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,593
[William Cassara, Damien Corsetti's attorney] Damien was picked for this job because he's big,

223
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:25,273
He's loud, and he's scary. That was his qualification.

224
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:28,393
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram, Afgan] "Soldiers are dying. Get the information."

225
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,953
That's all you're told. "Get the information."

226
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:36,197
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Soldiers said that when prisoners like Dilawar came into Bagram,

227
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:38,953
They were immediately assaulted.

228
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:45,953
They blasted music at them. Often, they had dogs barking at them.

229
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,793
And they would use some of the most menacing

230
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:53,713
Interrogators to create this sense of threat.

231
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,433
One of those was Damien Corsetti.

232
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:59,497
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram, Afgan] With the screening, you're trying to instill what's called "The Shock of Capture",

233
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:03,722
When the person first comes in. And that's when they are most apt to give you information

234
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,313
'cause they're just like, "Oh, crap, what's going on?"

235
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:10,424
It's not just a disorientation procedure, it's actually a terrorizing procedure.

236
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:14,073
It's designed to terrify you into spilling the beans, as it were.

237
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:19,353
Being spat at. Being sworn at. Having the dogs barking around. Cameras flashing in your face.

238
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:20,861
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Keep in mind, in their culture,

239
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:24,553
That dog's more shocking to them than it is to us.

240
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:28,197
Kind of like a woman telling them what to do. You know, it's a cultural thing.

241
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,073
So you get more bang for your buck, you know, with a dog.

242
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,499
[Moazzam Begg, British subject detained at Bagram and Guantanamo 2002-2005] And then to be re-shackled, completely naked,

243
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,953
and to do what they call "The Body Search,"

244
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:43,914
The cavity search, and then to be questioned naked, shivering.

245
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,633
[PFC. Willie Brand, Mil-Pol, Bagram] After they are read their rules and everything,

246
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:51,753
They are taken to their cell, to where they're going to be put in sleep deprivation for 24 hours.

247
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:53,953
That's standard for everybody.

248
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:58,844
Then, from there, MI directs us that they can go to general population, or if they have to stay in isolation.

249
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:02,378
And if they are going to stay in isolation, If they are going to be allowed to sleep.

250
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:03,993
And if they can, then when.

251
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:06,433
To weaken the defenses of detainees,

252
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:11,473
Interrogators ordered Mil-Pol to find ways of keeping the prisoners awake.

253
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:14,433
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] You know, they are in that room not saying anything...

254
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,530
"Oh, well, maybe he knows a little bit more.

255
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,713
Let's let him, you know, lose a little bit more sleep."

256
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:24,286
Which is the idea of keeping them like this, so you won't sleep. You'll stand.

257
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:29,621
Because as soon as you let your body go, that pressure on your wrist and your arms

258
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:32,794
You're going to feel that with those cuffs on.

259
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:38,500
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram, Afgan] The only time the MPs would ever help us do anything would be to keep them on a sleep schedule.

260
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,899
You know, they are guaranteed so much sleep.

261
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,071
Is that sleep consistent? Is it uninterrupted?

262
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,553
You know, there's 15 minutes here, 15 minutes there.

263
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:52,314
Who knows? That's how it was proposed to us.

264
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:56,273
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] There would be a board, when you walked into the room, on his wall.

265
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,993
You might see an arrow going up to the ceiling.

266
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:04,793
And there would be maybe a "1" by it. So that would be an hour up.

267
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:06,542
He's got to stand up for one hour.

268
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,553
And then you may see a "2" with an arrow pointing down.

269
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,393
That means he can sit down for two hours.

270
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:16,593
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] The prisoners were kept in these big pens downstairs.

271
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:20,593
And their numbers would be scribbled on the door of the airlock,

272
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:23,553
which was the little passageway that they were taken out of

273
00:23:23,554 --> 00:23:27,273
when they were brought up to the isolation cells upstairs.

274
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:31,039
[Moazzam Begg, British subject detained at Bagram and Guantanamo 2002-2005] Detainees were actually chained, with their hands above their heads,

275
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,142
in these airlocks. His number, "421," was something I could see often,

276
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,576
because his back was towards me

277
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:41,473
In the airlock, and the numbers were written on the backs of the detainees in black marker.

278
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:44,913
And we all had that. As well as on the front.

279
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:51,593
My number in Bagram was 180. But later it became "558."

280
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:55,793
Thank you. It's good to be with you. It's good to be here in Bagram.

281
00:23:55,794 --> 00:24:00,753
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I'm sure any high-ranking officer who toured would see the shackles,

282
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,673
because they are going to tour to look.

283
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,473
You know, they are curious just like everybody else is.

284
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:09,505
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram, Afgan] There are always officers coming and going through the facility.

285
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:13,296
We kind of joked about it as being The Greatest Show on Earth.

286
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:16,473
Everyone wanted to come and look at the terrorists.

287
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:20,993
Mr. Rumsfeld's office called our office frequently.

288
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:27,673
Very high commanders would want to be kept up-to-date on a daily basis on certain prisoners there.

289
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,917
The Brass knew. They saw them shackled. They saw them hooded.

290
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,473
And they said, "Right on! You're doing a great job!"

291
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:39,277
When the Red Cross toured Bagram, the sleep deprivation chart was erased.

292
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,073
And the prisoners were unshackled.

293
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:47,793
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Traditional military procedure did not allow you to shackle somebody to a fixed object.

294
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:51,473
Certainly not chaining their arms overhead.

295
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:58,113
Initially they were handcuffing people into the airlock of the cells for punishment.

296
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:02,111
And that was to be strictly limited. 15 minutes. Half an hour.

297
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:06,010
But it quickly "evolved". And when you walked in there,

298
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,233
They just had a pair of long handcuffs dangling from the wire mesh ceiling of the cell.

299
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:17,314
Ready for whoever came in.

300
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:30,874
Manner of Death: Homicide

301
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:36,713
The Army Coroner who examined Dilawar discovered massive tissue damage in his legs.

302
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:41,639
She later testified that his legs had been pulpified.

303
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,313
But what could have caused that kind of damage?

304
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:55,753
In a videotape that surfaced as part of the homicide investigation,

305
00:25:55,754 --> 00:26:00,873
Colonel David Hayden, the top Army lawyer for U.S. Forces in Afgan,

306
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:05,153
described a policy of shackling and striking detainees.

307
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:17,113
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I didn't actually hear a higher-up say,

308
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:20,113
"Go and kick them in the leg if they do this and they do that."

309
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:23,926
But the higher-ups said, "In order to get control of them,

310
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:26,233
That's an option that you can use."

311
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:31,378
[PFC. Willie Brand, Mil-Pol, Bagram] It's just your knee going into the side of their thigh about mid-way up.

312
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:38,073
There's supposed to be a pressure point right there. And it controls them really easy.

313
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:47,113
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Throughout the investigation, and even in the trials,

314
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:55,009
a lot of the guards and interrogators described Dilawar as a very combative detainee, as a tough character.

315
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:02,153
And that's just never been reconciled with all the other evidence that there was about this guy.

316
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,673
He weighed 122 pounds when he died.

317
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:09,713
The men who had been passengers in Dilawar's taxi told us later

318
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,753
that he had just been absolutely terrified at Bagram.

319
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:20,194
That they heard him through the walls of the isolation cells screaming for his mother and father.

320
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:23,607
[Moazzam Begg, British subject detained at Bagram and Guantanamo 2002-2005] He'd been in a very uncomfortable position

321
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:27,113
muttering some things, sometimes praying, sometimes asking for help,

322
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:32,233
Or seemingly asking for help, because I couldn't understand his language.

323
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:36,473
A number of witnesses remember the night before Dilawar died.

324
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:40,713
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Just that one night he got kicked in the leg, maybe like 10 times.

325
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:44,591
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Some of the soldiers said they started using the knee strikes essentially to shut them up,

326
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:47,000
Because he was yelling and screaming.

327
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,113
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] The damage that was done was done from multiple strikes.

328
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:55,030
And a lot of that could have been avoided had you known the person

329
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,474
before you had fought with them, and used that exact technique.

330
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:03,633
[Moazzam Begg, British subject detained at Bagram and Guantanamo 2002-2005] When they eventually came to take him to an isolation cell,

331
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,393
I believe his body had become almost limp.

332
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:12,113
One of the reasons why they began punching him was that they felt he was putting it on.

333
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:16,473
He was in the airlock standing there with a hood over his head.

334
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:21,553
He had his hands tied above his head, and he was moaning.

335
00:28:21,554 --> 00:28:24,913
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] He started to fight right there in the airlock.

336
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:28,193
And the airlock has a front gate and a back gate.

337
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:30,977
but on both sides There is barbed wire. But both sides are concertina wire.

338
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,873
Neither of us officers wanted to get into the concertina wire.

339
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:40,433
So we pulled him out of the airlock and put him on the floor, and put him into restraints.

340
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:43,393
What kind of force did you have to use to subdue him?

341
00:28:43,394 --> 00:28:46,713
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Physical force. He was struck.

342
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:49,519
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] There were like four MPs on this guy.

343
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,793
And one of the MPs just kept giving him kidney shots.

344
00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:57,633
The other two, they'd slam him to the ground.

345
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:01,273
And then the fourth one like jumped on his back.

346
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:04,393
He got a big gash on his nose.

347
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:08,215
[Moazzam Begg, British subject detained at Bagram and Guantanamo 2002-2005] There was no reason to hit him. Remember, he was shackled.

348
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:13,922
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Even when control wasn't an issue, it became "Well, I'm just going to do this to get mine in."

349
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,785
And that's probably why they got in trouble.

350
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:23,594
Because you really couldn't justify kicking the guy that much if he was just chained up.

351
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:29,207
Dilawar was taken to an isolation cell where the knee strikes continued.

352
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:34,234
In her statement at trial, the Army Coroner said his lower limbs

353
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:37,145
looked like they had been run over by a bus.

354
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:41,898
Had he lived, it would have been necessary to amputate his legs.

355
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,506
[PFC. Willie Brand, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Then it kind of raised the question of like,

356
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:48,112
"This is what we did to him." It's not just like this is what I did to him,

357
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:53,835
or this is what Cammie did to him, or Morden or anybody. Just, "This is what we've done."

358
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,979
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] It's almost hard to fathom now.

359
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,740
You had soldiers like Willie Brand who seems like this very gentle, kind of soft-spoken guy,

360
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,687
But who testified that he struck Dilawar so many times in the leg that his knee got tired,

361
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:12,496
and he had to switch to the other one.

362
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:21,446
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Sometimes I feel that I should have gone with my own morality

363
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,606
more than what was common.

364
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:33,922
One MP testified that the strikes became an amusement inflicted on Dilawar just to hear him scream "Allah."

365
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:37,509
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] Some would say, "Well, hey, you should have stopped this. You should have stopped that

366
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:41,138
When you saw he was injured, or saw he was being kicked on this...

367
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:44,046
Why didn't you do something?" That would be a good question!

368
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:46,317
And my answer would be, "Well, you know, it was us against them."

369
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:52,032
I was over there. I didn't want to appear to be going against my fellow soldiers.

370
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:57,747
Which...is that wrong? You could sit here and say that was dead wrong.

371
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:59,983
Go over there and say that!

372
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,647
No one ever investigated who set the rules at Bagram.

373
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:12,580
Investigators never asked Capt. Wood what senior officers

374
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,895
had given orders to treat detainees in ways that were forbidden according to the Army Field Manual.

375
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:23,957
MP Capt. Beiring was the only officer prosecuted in the case.

376
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:28,662
His dereliction of duty charge was dismissed when the judge determined

377
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:32,556
That no one had made clear what Capt. Beiring's duty was.

378
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:38,532
In spite of repeated requests for proper training, rules of engagement for his soldiers,

379
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,708
His superiors gave him neither.

380
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,800
[SPC. Glendale Walls, 519th Mil-Intel, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] We were all worried about not having that written guidelines.

381
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,582
But they kept reassuring us that it was coming.

382
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,662
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram] We knew exactly why we weren't getting clear guidance,

383
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,589
just in case something like this happened.

384
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,709
[SPC. Glendale Walls, 519th Mil-Intel, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] If I had to do it again, I'd probably say "No."

385
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,443
I'm not doing anything until I see something in writing.

386
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:08,158
Do you think that looking back, you think you were misled?

387
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,466
[SPC. Glendale Walls, 519th Mil-Intel, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] I think we all were.

388
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:48,371
A week after September 11th, Vice-President Dick Cheney appeared on Meet the Press

389
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:54,828
to describe how interrogation policies were about to change.

390
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:55,861
PAY BACK

391
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:59,038
[Vice-President Dick Cheney] They have to work so that the Dark Side, if you will.

392
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,451
We've got to spend time in the shadows in the Intelligence World.

393
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:07,727
A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion,

394
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:11,743
using sources and methods that are available to our Intelligence Agencies.

395
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:15,828
If we're going to be successful! That's the world these folks operate in.

396
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:23,145
And so it's going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objective.

397
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:27,352
[Scott Horton, Chair, Committee on International Law, NYC Bar Association] It's very clear that it starts in the office of Vice-President Cheney.

398
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:33,651
He had a very strong view that we were not as aggressive

399
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:38,837
in dealing with people in interrogations as we could or should be.

400
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:42,823
"Taking the gloves off." Being rough with detainees.

401
00:33:42,823 --> 00:33:49,542
If Dick Cheney was the primary architect of a new policy, John Yoo was the chief draftsman.

402
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:55,757
He wrote guiding opinions that argued for a flexible approach to treating suspected terrorists.

403
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:59,942
[John Yoo, Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003] The United States used to treat terrorism as a criminal justice problem.

404
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:04,553
The September 11th attacks showed that the struggle with Al Qaeda had moved into warfare.

405
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:11,976
And I think when a foreign entity for political purposes, can kill 3,000 Americans, and cause billions of dollars of damage,

406
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:15,839
And try to eliminate the leaders of the American government,

407
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,961
That sounds like war to most people. It doesn't sound like crime.

408
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:22,741
President Bush declared a war on terror.

409
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:28,791
But he raised questions about whether suspected terrorists should be protected by the laws of war:

410
00:34:28,915 --> 00:34:31,125
The Geneva Conventions.

411
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:37,849
Atrocities that shocked the conscience of the world gave rise to the modern Geneva Conventions.

412
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:44,925
International treaties meant to provide fundamental protections for every human being captured in wartime.

413
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:52,595
In effect for over 50 years, Geneva offered legal protections and prohibited interrogators

414
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:58,433
from using torture, murder, or even humiliating and degrading treatment.

415
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:07,315
After 9/11, John Yoo worked closely with Dick Cheney's office and Alberto Gonzales, counsel to the President.

416
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:14,592
They wrote a series of memos arguing that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to suspected terrorists.

417
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:18,712
And they gave legal cover for the CIA and Special Forces

418
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:24,035
to embark on a secret program of previously forbidden interrogation techniques.

419
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:28,293
["President" George Bush] More than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries.

420
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:33,701
Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way:

421
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:36,740
They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies!

422
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,331
The problem for the President, Gonzales warned,

423
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:51,569
was that some of the new interrogation techniques were banned under U.S. and International law.

424
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,969
[Rear Admiral John Hutson (Ret., Former Judge Advocate General, 30 Years Military experience] One of the points that he makes is

425
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:57,731
that we don't want the Geneva Conventions to apply,

426
00:35:57,731 --> 00:36:02,803
because if they do, these things can be war crimes.

427
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:07,030
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] What's well known is the principle of command responsibility.

428
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,137
This was established in the Nuremberg trials after World War II.

429
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:13,305
And it established the principle of International Criminal Law.

430
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:17,280
That individuals who order illegal treatment will be held accountable

431
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,363
for the illegal treatment, even if they're not immediately applying that kind of abusive treatment.

432
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:29,383
To be certain that Americans interrogating prisoners would not be accused of torture,

433
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:34,663
John Yoo co-authored a memo that would clarify the meaning of the term.

434
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:37,656
[Senator Carl Levin, Senate Armed Services Committee] The only prohibited acts would be extreme acts,

435
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:45,853
which are equivalent to serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions, or even death.

436
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,232
That's an illegal memo. That's the so-called "torture memo."

437
00:36:49,232 --> 00:36:53,919
[Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General Confirmation Hearing] That was an arguable interpretation of the law.

438
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:57,663
I'm sure we had discussions about it. And ultimately, it was accepted.

439
00:36:57,663 --> 00:37:03,929
Because that was the ultimate decision and position of the Office of Legal Counsel.

440
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,811
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] The office of Legal Counsel memorandum was unbounded.

441
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:14,533
Meaning that nowhere did it state that the application of cruel and unhuman

442
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,186
and degrading treatment was prohibited.

443
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:20,239
And at one point I asked John Yoo, "Can the President authorized torture?"

444
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,413
And his response was "Yes."

445
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:27,950
[John Yoo, Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003] I think the lawyer's job is to tell people what laws do or do not apply,

446
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,247
so that they know what space they have to make their policy decision.

447
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:53,475
Military lawyers were outraged by the implications of John Yoo's memo.

448
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,696
[Scott Horton, Chair, Committee on International Law, NYC Bar Association] My first involvement in this came

449
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:59,468
when I was visited by a group of very senior JAG officers [JAG=Judge Advocate General]

450
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:02,727
more than a year before the first story about Abu Ghraib broke,

451
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,296
Who were very troubled about what was going on.

452
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:13,711
And the focus of their concern was failing in the responsibilities that the military leadership had to soldiers in the field.

453
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,616
That was responsibility to provide

454
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:21,340
fair, clear guidance to them as to how to behave in these difficult circumstances.

455
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:28,384
And what they saw was an intentional decision taken at the height of the Pentagon

456
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:35,511
to put out a fog of ambiguity, coupled with great pressure to bring results.

457
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:40,233
To be prepared to be violent with the detainees.

458
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:46,321
But, you know, this violence with the detainees is a criminal act.

459
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,864
[Senator John McCain] They may be Al Qaeda. They may be Taliban.

460
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:54,641
They may be the worst people in the world, and I'm sure that some of them are.

461
00:38:54,641 --> 00:39:01,189
But there are certain basic rules, and international agreements that the United States has agreed to

462
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:04,982
That we will observe. You go ahead and please respond. You wanted to.

463
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:08,401
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] Okay, very quickly, let me clarify. The President's policy:

464
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:13,503
"As a matter of policy the United States Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely,

465
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:20,410
and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva."

466
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,676
[Senator John McCain] That is a legalistic statement and one that is ridden with loopholes.

467
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:32,769
And it is clear to me that the interrogators did not understand that "humane treatment" might be in the eye of the beholder.

468
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:40,501
In the field in Afgan, there was a great deal of confusion about exactly what the rules were.

469
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:42,919
[SPC. Glendale Walls, 519th Mil-Intel, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] They told us when dealing with the PUCs

470
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:45,456
as they called them, the Persons Under U.S. Custody,

471
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:48,292
"They don't fall under Geneva Conventions."

472
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:52,572
Basically, the only thing we weren't allowed to do is beat 'em up.

473
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:56,532
"Person Under Control," "Person Under Custody." Something like that.

474
00:39:56,533 --> 00:40:00,543
You know, they call them anything to dehumanize them so that you don't look at them as people.

475
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:04,622
[SGT. Thomas Curtis, Mil-Pol, Bagram] I don't remember hearing anything about Geneva Convention.

476
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:11,447
Of course I'm familiar with it, but they didn't go over that in any kind of detail.

477
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:14,081
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram] I didn't know what the Field Manual for Interrogation,

478
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,728
I didn't know the proper nomenclature for it. I'd seen it.

479
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,392
There was a copy lying around, I'm sure, somewhere.

480
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:25,503
And if I had chosen to, I could have picked it up and read it. But I was working 16-hour days.

481
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:30,033
To sit down and read a Field Manual was not top of my priorities over there.

482
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,977
[Vice-President Dick Cheney] It is a mean, nasty, dangerous, dirty business out there.

483
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:37,853
And we have to operate in that arena.

484
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,549
I'm convinced we can do it. We can do it successfully.

485
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,877
But we need to make certain that we have not tied the hands,

486
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:49,151
if you will, of our Intelligence Communities in terms of accomplishing their mission.

487
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:51,618
[Fox News] These terrorists play by a whole different set of rules.

488
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:57,137
It's going to force us...in your words...to get mean, dirty and nasty? in order to take them on?

489
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,259
[Vice-President Dick Cheney] Uh-hmm. Right.

490
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,109
Guided by a legal opinion from John Yoo,

491
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,358
The Bush Administration began shipping some high-value detainees

492
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,909
to the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

493
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:26,690
[Rear Admiral John Hutson (Ret.), Former Judge Advocate General, 30 Years Military Experience] Initially I thought, "Good, safe place! Put them there, barbed wire all over."

494
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:34,529
Then it became apparent the reason we were doing it was because we were going to argue that there's no law.

495
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:37,883
You know, Cuban law didn't apply.  U.S. law didn't apply.

496
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:40,430
Well, that was a big step down the slippery slope.

497
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,641
[John Yoo, Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003] I think what the policy makers are trying to do

498
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:47,426
was to try and find a place that was physically close to the United States

499
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:50,713
so it can be well-protected but still would benefit from the rule

500
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:58,123
that the United States Military has ultimate say and control over any prisoners held outside the country.

501
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:06,546
["President" George W. Bush] One by one the terrorists are learning the meaning of American "Justice."

502
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:07,587
The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate under Councilman, which concluded that,

503
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:08,334
As a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740.

504
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:09,053
Neither of the comity considerations Councilman identified weighs in favor of abstention here.

505
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:09,858
First, the assertion that military discipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces’ efficient operation, are best served if the military justice system acts

506
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:10,567
without regular interference from civilian courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member.

507
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,411
Second, the view that federal courts should respect the balance Congress struck when it created “an integrated system of military courts and review procedures” is inapposite,

508
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:12,089
since the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated system. Rather than Councilman, the most relevant precedent is Ex parte Quirin,

509
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:12,829
where the Court, far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because of (1) the public importance of the questions raised,

510
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:13,642
(2) the Court’s duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those questions without delay, 317 U. S, at 19.

511
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:14,573
The Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty

512
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,398
to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has conferred on them Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2006

513
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:16,372
The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 , n. 14, suggesting that this Court lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument

514
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:17,266
because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for observing and enforcing prisoners’ rights under the Convention.

515
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:18,403
However, Eisentrager does not control here because, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407,

516
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:19,717
They are indisputably part of the law of war, see Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 520~521, compliance with which is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted

517
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,774
Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2006

518
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:30,301
In December, 2001, a man named Mohamed al-Kahtani [Muhammed al-Qahtani] was swept up in Afgan and sent to Guantanamo.

519
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:36,903
After eight months in detention, the Army "discovered" that he "may have" trained to be the 20th hijacker.

520
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:43,204
Suddenly, Kahtani became the most important detainee in Guantanamo.

521
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:49,003
[Brigadier General Jay Hood, Commander Joint Task Force, Guantanamo 2004-2006] Here we had a man who was supposed to have been

522
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:52,257
on that plane that was flown into the Pennsylvania countryside.

523
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:59,181
So I think there was a sense of urgency to find out what this guy knew in order to be able to prevent any future attacks.

524
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:04,696
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] He successfully resisted standard interrogation techniques at Guantanamo for eight months.

525
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:11,120
And he is the genesis for the request by the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo for more techniques

526
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,198
that might be able to get past his resistance training.

527
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:21,664
In September 2002, John Yoo and Alberto Gonzales traveled to Guantanamo.

528
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:27,235
Soon after their visit, and just before Dilawar's arrival at Bagram,

529
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:36,017
Donald Rumsfeld personally approved a new menu of psychological interrogation techniques for use on Mohamed al-Kahtani.

530
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:44,688
Exactly how the techniques would be applied was often left to the imagination of the interrogators.

531
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:57,773
[Gita Gutierrez, Lawyer for Mohammed al-Qahtani] His interrogations are well documented in a log,

532
00:43:57,773 --> 00:44:01,723
and from November, 2002 until early January, 2003,

533
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:04,425
He was subjected to this regime.

534
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:08,733
It involved very severe sleep deprivation.

535
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:15,100
He was only permitted to sleep 4 hours a day

536
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:21,596
From 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 in the morning. and that lasted for 50 days with one exception.

537
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:27,277
He was held in severe isolation and sensory deprivation.

538
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:40,792
There are a number of instances in the log where you will see the phrase "invasion of space by a female."

539
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:43,671
And that was actually an interrogation tactic designed to break his faith.

540
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:48,932
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] The Interrogator approached Detainee from behind,

541
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,092
and rubbed his back, whispered in his ear, and ran fingers through his hair.

542
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:54,770
That was authorized under the utility technique.

543
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:04,468
[Gita Gutierrez, Lawyer for Mohammed al-Qahtani] He was subjected to what I would call "sexual assault" by female interrogators.

544
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:10,141
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] He was forced to wear women's lingerie.

545
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:14,921
There were multiple allegations of homosexuality, and that his comrades were aware of that.

546
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,783
He was forced to dance with a male interrogator.

547
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:22,068
Subject to strip searches for control measures, not for security.

548
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:29,262
And he was forced to perform dog tricks. All of this to lower his personal sense of worth.

549
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:38,819
[Gita Gutierrez, Lawyer for Mohammed al-Qahtani] They've tried to characterize it as individual interrogators

550
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,376
pushing the envelope, or starting to get (quote) "creative."

551
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:27,619
[Gita Gutierrez, Lawyer for Mohammed al-Qahtani] The combination of his lack of food intake and forcible hydration led him

552
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:33,870
at one point to actually his heart slowed down to 35 beats a minute, and he was rushed to the hospital to be revived.

553
00:46:43,649 --> 00:46:49,915
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] Mohamed al-Kahtani, in many ways, that single interrogation, protected interrogation,

554
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:58,008
Contains within it, if you will, the entire genealogy, the entire history of CIA torture over the last 50 years.

555
00:46:58,243 --> 00:47:04,494
The CIA launched a mind control project, a veritable Manhattan Project of the Mind, in the 1950s.

556
00:47:04,494 --> 00:47:09,421
In-house, the CIA worked on exotic techniques. Hypnosis.

557
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:15,617
And then they worked on sodium pentathol. And then they worked on electro-shock. And ultimately, they discovered LSD.

558
00:47:15,617 --> 00:47:19,567
All of that broke stuff, in-house, went nowhere, except to lawsuits.

559
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:26,275
But what did work, was the CIA outsourced all the dull, behavioral research

560
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:31,574
to the most brilliant behavioral scientists at the top universities in the United States and Canada.

561
00:47:31,574 --> 00:47:38,225
At McGill, experiments by famed psychologist Donald O. Hebb caught the eye of CIA researchers.

562
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:45,304
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] Dr. Hebb found that he could induce a state akin to acute psychosis in 48 hours.

563
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:50,799
All he did, he had student volunteers sit in a very pleasant air-conditioned cubicle

564
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:56,426
With goggles, gloves and ear muffs. Actually, you know what they looked just like? The Guantanamo detainees!

565
00:47:56,426 --> 00:48:02,081
If you see those outfits that the Guantanamo detainees have where they have the gloves and the goggles and the ear muffs?

566
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:06,025
You know, everybody thinks that's security. No, no, no. That's sensory breakdown.

567
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:11,229
Within a day there would be hallucinations. Within two days, breakdown.

568
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:14,129
[Dr. Donald O. Hebb, McGill University, Quebec] I began to think while we were doing our experiments

569
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:18,187
that it is possible that something that involves physical discomfort

570
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:25,010
or even pain might be more tolerable than simply the deprivation conditions that we studied.

571
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:27,892
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] The CIA was fascinated by this. They jumped on it immediately.

572
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:32,529
[Dr. Donald O. Hebb, McGill University, Quebec] I had no idea what a potentially vicious weapon this could be.

573
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:35,551
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] They identify two key techniques:

574
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:40,025
They identified sensory disorientation, and they identified self-inflicted pain: standing.

575
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:43,677
For days at a time while fluids flowed to the legs.

576
00:48:43,677 --> 00:48:49,440
And they put them together in the Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual.

577
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,592
And they propagated it around the world and through the U.S. Intelligence community.

578
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:58,507
Think about what al-Kahtani was subjected to, okay?

579
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:02,932
First of all, he's in dark; he's in light.  He's in cold; he's in heat.

580
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:07,188
What they are doing is they are attacking his universal sensory receptors.

581
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:10,691
They are also scrambling his time. So that's Phase One.

582
00:49:11,162 --> 00:49:15,928
In Guantanamo under the regime of General Miller,

583
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:20,297
he turned Guantanamo into a veritable behavioral scientific laboratory.

584
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:25,110
And Donald Rumsfeld gave orders for techniques beyond the Field Manual.

585
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,688
And they percolated. And they percolated in an ambiguous way

586
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:33,645
that allowed people to kind of do what they thought needed to be done.

587
00:49:33,645 --> 00:49:38,885
And they explore Arab male sensitivity to gender and sexual identity.

588
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:44,450
So that's the thing about being homosexual. The underwear on the head. All that sort of stuff.

589
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,013
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Interrogator, Iraq] People were saying, "Arabs really are very sensitive to sexual humiliation."

590
00:49:49,013 --> 00:49:52,492
Well, who the hell isn't sensitive to sexual humiliation?

591
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:57,983
You know, nobody wants to be stripped down naked and forced to masturbate with a hood over your head. It's ridiculous!

592
00:49:57,983 --> 00:50:01,058
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] Then they created behavioral science consultation teams

593
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:05,344
where they had military psychologists integrate into the ongoing interrogation

594
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:13,328
to discover individual fears and phobias. And all of that was visited on al-Kahtani.

595
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:19,967
[Senator John McCain] You are aware of communications between General Miller and Secretary Rumsfeld specifically about this one prisoner?

596
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:25,138
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] To our knowledge there was a considerable amount of communication up and down the chain.

597
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,218
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] As you know, from General Schmidt's report,

598
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:35,673
he concluded that these techniques individually did not constitute torture.

599
00:50:35,673 --> 00:50:37,466
But he said that the sum of these techniques ...

600
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:41,150
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] The cumulative effect of simultaneous applications of numerous,

601
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,481
authorized techniques had abusive and degrading impact on the detainee.

602
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,705
And he recommended that General Miller be disciplined.

603
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:53,259
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] But he said it did not constitute torture.

604
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:57,098
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] We made a distinction between what torture and inhumane treatment would be,

605
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:02,407
given the general guidelines, and then what might be abusive and degrading.

606
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:05,531
Something might be degrading, but not necessarily torture.

607
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:10,459
And it may not be inhumane. It may be humiliating, but it may not be torture.

608
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:16,219
No torture, no physical pain injury. There was a safe, secure environment the entire time.

609
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:20,317
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] And that, of course, is the genius of the CIA's psychological paradigm.

610
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,609
Psychological torture is all a matter of definitions. And it's very slippery indeed.

611
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,171
[Senator] That sounds remarkably similar to what occurred at Abu Ghraib. People being led around in chains.

612
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:39,904
People being forced to wear lingerie. Perhaps a coincidence, perhaps not.

613
00:51:40,685 --> 00:51:43,084
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] If you look at those Abu Ghraib photographs, again,

614
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:45,404
it's always the same techniques.

615
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:48,706
First of all, there's the sexual activity with the woman's garments.

616
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:53,121
And the masturbation and all the rest. That's the cultural sensitivity.

617
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:56,714
They are short-shackled; they are long-shackled; they are shackled upside-down.

618
00:51:56,714 --> 00:52:02,635
These are stress positions. The most famous of all Abu Ghraib photographs, of course,

619
00:52:02,635 --> 00:52:06,497
Of that hooded Iraqi standing on a box, arms outstretched.

620
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:13,791
He's told if he steps off the box, if he moves, he'll be electrocuted. That's the point of the fake electrical wires.

621
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:19,149
So it's the absolute immobility for protracted periods. And then with arms extended.

622
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:23,201
As we would say to the viewers, "Don't try this at home." But do try it!

623
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:28,782
Just stand for ten minutes with your arms stretched out, not moving.

624
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:35,989
Carolyn Wood was an example of the way new techniques spread and mutated like a virus.

625
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:43,289
Long before Wood took charge of interrogation at Abu Ghraib, her unit was involved with harsh techniques at Bagram,

626
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:47,741
including stress positions, forced standing, and sleep deprivation.

627
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:51,649
[Tim Golden, New York Times Journalist] One of the memoranda shows that in early December, 2002,

628
00:52:51,649 --> 00:52:56,678
the interrogators at Bagram just looked on the Internet... they are in touch with the guys at Guantanamo..

629
00:52:56,678 --> 00:53:02,389
and they learned that these guys at Guantanamo had gotten new techniques from the Secretary of Defense,

630
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:10,076
and they just started using them. Even though the techniques had clearly been approved exclusively for use at Guantanamo.

631
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:16,079
[Professor Alfred McCoy, Author of "A Question of Torture"] When General Miller himself traveled from Guantanamo to Iraq in August, 2003,

632
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,836
he brought with him a CD and a manual on the "advanced" techniques they had developed at Guantanamo.

633
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:25,029
And he gave them to General Sanchez's command.

634
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:29,378
So there are these multiple paths that you can trace

635
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:33,684
whereby these interrogators' techniques go through this global migration,

636
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:40,523
through Afgan, to Iraq, from Guantanamo directly to Iraq. And the net result is Abu Ghraib.

637
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,947
Well before the abuses at Abu Ghraib became public,

638
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:54,003
government officials had been quietly raising concerns about harsh techniques in use at Guantanamo.

639
00:53:54,003 --> 00:53:59,429
[Senator Carl Levin, Senate Armed Services Committee] There were emails back to the Department of Justice from FBI personnel down at Guantanamo saying,

640
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:03,233
"You won't believe what's going on down here.

641
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:09,552
We've got to disassociate ourselves as FBI people from what is going on here in Guantanamo."

642
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:15,259
This email says "The DOD has their marching orders from the Secretary of Defense"

643
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:19,304
..."Marching orders from the Secretary of Defense!"...

644
00:54:19,304 --> 00:54:25,269
to engage in practices which the FBI finds to be deeply offensive and dangerous."

645
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:29,388
But the emails are what is called "redacted",

646
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:33,675
which means that there's big holes in these emails.

647
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:37,811
Now some of these emails are totally redacted, so we don't know what they say at all.

648
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:41,796
That's an example of a lot of the documents that we got here.

649
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:45,646
You know, you can't see anything on these documents.

650
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:49,888
There's one after another where there's nothing.

651
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:59,061
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] In early December, 2002,

652
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:02,392
I had heard that there was detainee abuse going on.

653
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:06,530
I called the Army General Counsel and asked him whether he had any information.

654
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,378
I said, "I'm receiving reports that some of the detainees are being abused at Guantanamo.

655
00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:10,737
Do you know anything about this?"

656
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:15,723
And his response back was, "I know a lot about it. Come on down to my office."

657
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:18,564
They pushed a stack of documents across the desk.

658
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:25,188
The top document was Memorandum from the General Counsel, Department of Defense to Secretary Rumsfeld.

659
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:31,061
And it was that cover memo that requested authorization of the application of certain interrogation techniques.

660
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:35,990
And the top memo gave Secretary Rumsfeld's approval for the application of some of those techniques.

661
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:42,327
It's the memo with Secretary Rumsfeld's handwritten notations on the bottom saying that he stands 8-10 hours a day...

662
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:46,746
"How come these detainees are only required to stand up to four hours a day?"

663
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:51,509
I was astounded! But my first reaction was that this was a mistake!

664
00:55:51,509 --> 00:55:55,771
Somebody just didn't read the documents carefully enough.

665
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:03,807
[Tim Golden, New York Times Journalist] I think people in the Pentagon thought of Alberto Mora as a loyal, Republican, political appointee.

666
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:08,359
He would never have been considered a rabble-rouser or a liberal.

667
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:17,223
He said he expected that he would raise these issues, and people in positions of authority would say,

668
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:20,587
"Oh! Thanks for letting us know." And that would be the end of it.

669
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:25,709
[Reporter] I want to ask you about a memo that was written by Alberto Mora.

670
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:31,505
Do you recall on this memo that you wrote a little notation on the bottom about standing more than four hours,

671
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:33,300
- because you stand at your desk ...- [Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld] [Cuts him off] I do! I do!

672
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,566
[Reporter] This attorney argued that that could be interpreted by some as a wink-and-a-nod

673
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:43,839
that it would be okay to go beyond the techniques that were prescribed in the memo.

674
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,049
[Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There's no wink-and-a-nod about anything.

675
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:52,317
There was one provision in there that they would have people stand for several hours,

676
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:59,187
and it was a semi-humorous remark that a person in his seventies stands all day long.

677
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:05,978
I just mused that in...and maybe it shouldn't have gone out, but it did...and I wrote it. And life goes on.

678
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:11,405
[Reporter] But his point was that you should have gotten much better advice from your legal staff...

679
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,078
[Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld] [Interrupts Reporter again] I heard your question the first time!

680
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:15,962
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] What was of concern to me was the techniques,

681
00:57:15,962 --> 00:57:19,006
how their individual and in combination could rise to the level of torture.

682
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:22,438
Okay, you're permitting certain interrogation techniques. But certainly there must be

683
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:26,684
some limit which is set on the severity of the techniques.

684
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:31,469
Light deprivation could mean placing the detainee in a dark room for 15 minutes,

685
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:35,558
or it could mean a month. Or two months. Or three months until he goes blind.

686
00:57:35,558 --> 00:57:41,003
"Detainee's specific phobia techniques": the snakes, the bats, the rats,

687
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,992
lock somebody up in a coffin...you're limited only by your imagination.

688
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:48,690
Any one of these techniques individually could yield the results of torture.

689
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,397
Certainly, in combination, you could reach that fairly quickly.

690
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:54,196
[Dr. Donald O. Hebb] See, if you put a person into this procedure,

691
00:57:54,197 --> 00:57:57,113
and keep them there for more than the six or eight days

692
00:57:57,113 --> 00:58:02,304
that I would think might be the maximum tolerability, then the price is pretty high.

693
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:03,784
The price is someone's sanity?

694
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,163
[Dr. Donald O. Hebb] Presumably, it could be.

695
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:11,700
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] The medical literature had a phenomenon called "force drift," that made it almost inevitable

696
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:17,897
That the interrogators would continue applying greater and greater increments of force to achieve their desired results.

697
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:20,345
[Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell] For example, take Secretary Rumsfeld's memo.

698
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:23,646
And to say that, "Well, look, he said that dogs have to be muzzled."

699
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:28,047
Well, that's a man who doesn't understand the Military on the ground.

700
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:36,240
Because when that E-6 is sitting there with that muzzled dog, and there is absolutely no impact on that person being interrogated,

701
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,483
He's going to take that muzzle off. That's reality. That's human nature.

702
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:49,473
Alberto Mora threatened to go on record with his concerns unless the techniques were rescinded.

703
00:58:49,473 --> 00:58:55,008
[Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld] When, after the facts, it turns out that there is concern about it that concerns me,

704
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:59,076
then I'm happy to rescind it and take another fresh look at it.

705
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:01,991
And talk to more people about it. And see what ought to be done.

706
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:05,500
[Alberto Mora, General Counsel to the Navy, 2001-2006] To his credit, Secretary Rumsfeld did rescind the interrogation techniques.

707
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:12,032
And then, for over a year and a half, I heard no reports from any quarter about detainee abuse anywhere.

708
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:24,164
When Abu Ghraib hit, my first thought was, "Had I been circumvented?

709
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:31,013
Had their been authorizations for the abuse of prisoners that I had not learned about?"

710
00:59:32,752 --> 00:59:37,197
Had the orders really been rescinded?

711
00:59:38,126 --> 00:59:46,851
According to interrogators, the use of shackling, dogs, stress positions and sensory assault, continued to be widespread.

712
00:59:47,824 --> 00:59:56,143
Tony Lagouranis was an interrogator who arrived in Iraq after the Military became aware of the abuses at Abu Ghraib.

713
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:59,251
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Interrogator, Iraq] Among the Interrogation Guidelines they gave us,

714
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:02,023
it said that dogs are authorized to be used on detainees.

715
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:05,167
You know, stress positions. Sleep deprivation.

716
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:11,524
All of those things that I did, or I would consider harsh techniques, or violating Geneva Conventions,

717
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:16,975
I was told to do. So we were told to do that to these people by our Superiors.

718
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:24,369
[Rear Admiral John Hutson (Ret., Former Judge Advocate General, 30 Years Military experience] The spine of the United States Armed Forces is the chain of command.

719
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:28,803
What starts at the top of the chain of command drops like a rock down the chain of command.

720
01:00:28,803 --> 01:00:35,887
And that's why Lynndie England knew what Donald Rumsfeld was thinking without actually talking to Donald Rumsfeld.

721
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:43,298
In the wake of Abu Ghraib, journalists began to look harder at previous cases of abuse ...

722
01:00:43,998 --> 01:00:49,663
To try to understand what had caused them and who was responsible.

723
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:53,060
[Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell] People like Tim Golden at the New York Times

724
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,855
got a hold of it and started looking at the case of Dilawar, in particular. The taxi driver.

725
01:00:56,855 --> 01:01:05,708
It became at least plausible to me that this man wasn't even guilty of anything other than being there when the sweep occurred.

726
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:10,333
And here was a guy who was murdered in detention.

727
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:25,999
[Speaker] In memory for those whose lives were taken, for those who gave selflessly of themselves.

728
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:30,362
Four years ago our nation came under attack ...

729
01:01:30,362 --> 01:01:34,735
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] 9/11 was very much in the air. And I think the officers tried to keep it in the air.

730
01:01:34,735 --> 01:01:38,214
They tried to remind these kids that these people are our enemies.

731
01:01:38,214 --> 01:01:42,849
But it's hard to see how these young soldiers could have been expected to figure out

732
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:49,965
who their real enemies were among a bunch of militiamen and farmers in a society that was completely foreign to them.

733
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,989
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] If I remember correctly, his story

734
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:59,796
had something to do with the rocket attack at a military base.

735
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:03,150
And he was supposed to be the driver of the get-away car.

736
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,269
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] He had taken his new car, which he was obviously excited about,

737
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:13,322
And driven to Khost, the provincial capitol, where he went to look for taxi passengers.

738
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:17,217
And he in fact found these three men in Khost, at the marketplace,

739
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:22,430
- Who were headed back to Yakubi. - Yakubi! Yakubi!

740
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:32,151
You have to imagine that Dilawar was driving home from this provincial capitol, which was about as far as his world stretched.

741
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:38,192
He gets stopped at Fire Base Salerno by a group of Afghan militiamen.

742
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:44,701
And the men apparently found an electric stabilizer in the trunk of the car. At least they claimed to.

743
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:50,120
Camp Salerno had been rocketed from some distance earlier in the day.

744
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:57,897
And the Afghan militiamen immediately arrested the four guys on suspicion of having had some involvement in that attack.

745
01:02:58,577 --> 01:03:03,464
He's taken to Bagram this great distance away.

746
01:03:03,464 --> 01:03:09,038
You get a bunch of guys who are back at this detention site, and they are told that we have evidence

747
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:12,759
that they have been involved in a rocket attack on American forces.

748
01:03:12,759 --> 01:03:17,059
So I think that kind of tripped a wire in them.

749
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,330
[Tony Lagouranis, Military Interrogator, Iraq] You're in this atmosphere where you're with nothing but military people.

750
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,935
And you feel sort of morally isolated. And you lose your moral bearings.

751
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:30,782
Then you're frustrated because you're not getting intelligence from a prisoner that you believe is guilty

752
01:03:30,782 --> 01:03:34,818
And has intelligence to give you. So, of course, you want to start pushing the limits,

753
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:37,179
And see how far you can go.

754
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,338
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] A lot of the pressure came from the fact

755
01:03:39,339 --> 01:03:46,327
that we had a few high value detainees that gave a lot of good information.

756
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:51,911
And when we started to lose those detainees due to going to Guantanamo Bay,

757
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,429
That they expected this to come from everybody.

758
01:03:55,429 --> 01:04:00,085
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram] We would interrogate some of these guys just to interrogate them.

759
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:03,717
And it was ridiculous. I mean, you'd get some of these guys in and you're like,

760
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:08,250
"This is the wrong man. This is not who we're supposed to have."

761
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,296
Especially being a screener, you could tell from the moment you got him in.

762
01:04:11,296 --> 01:04:13,515
You're like, "We're not supposed to have him."

763
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:19,487
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] We had one prisoner came in who was mentally challenged.

764
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:25,026
And SGT. Loring kept saying that, you know, this is a cover.

765
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:27,406
This is al Qaeda's cover. This is what they do.

766
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:35,654
And I went in there and talked to him and, basically, they had this guy in a diaper.

767
01:04:36,646 --> 01:04:41,933
He'd eat his own feces. But Loring kept saying it was an act.

768
01:04:41,933 --> 01:04:44,598
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, 519th Mil-Intel Unit, Bagram] They'd be like, "Hey, we want you to go yell at this guy."

769
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:48,852
So I'd grab my box of Frosted Flakes that I was eating for breakfast that morning,

770
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:51,412
and I'd go into the room, and I'd be like, "Alright, I have to yell at you today."

771
01:04:51,413 --> 01:04:57,772
So I'd be like "dehydrogenated salt substitute." And just start yelling that at them. And they'd be like,

772
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,252
They'd look at me all crazy, and I'd be like,

773
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:03,252
"Yeah! That's your fault they put that in my cereal now."

774
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:07,971
Or I'd yell at them if Elvis was really the King of Rock, or if he was dead.

775
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:10,870
Or stuff like that. And I'd write that in my interrogation summaries.

776
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:14,055
And I'd send that up to higher that that's what I did for that two hours.

777
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:19,280
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] You really can't get a feel for a person until after you talk to him a couple of times.

778
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,648
So on the first three times I talked to him, it was just verifying his story.

779
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:27,322
Looking for loops. Looking for holes. After the third time I talked to him,

780
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:31,490
and his story was still consistent, I kept telling him I thought he was innocent.

781
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:34,383
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] And they wanted these people to be guilty

782
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:36,795
because that would look better for their unit.

783
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:40,702
They could say that we arrested 60 people this month. And they were all terrorists.

784
01:05:40,702 --> 01:05:44,157
[Moazzam Begg, Detained at Bagram and Guantanamo] "When was the last time you saw Osama bin Laden?" "When was the last time you saw Mohamed Atta?"

785
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:48,137
Now, this was a standard question that they would ask of every detainee.

786
01:05:48,137 --> 01:05:50,947
[Tony Lagouranis, Military Interrogator, Iraq] It's very hard to go into an interrogation with very little evidence...

787
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,320
and we almost never had evidence on these guys...and elicit a confession.

788
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:59,349
You can go in and get intelligence, but if you're asking this guy to completely incriminate himself,

789
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:06,264
it's very difficult. So you have to start using harsher and harsher techniques in order to elicit the confession.

790
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:10,396
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] I was yelled at for being too nice to him by SGT. Loring.

791
01:06:10,396 --> 01:06:12,478
That I needed to put more pressure on him.

792
01:06:12,478 --> 01:06:15,470
As he liked to say, "I needed to take him out of his comfort zone."

793
01:06:19,545 --> 01:06:23,134
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] After a while, particularly in the fourth and fifth interrogations,

794
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:29,825
as the sleep deprivation that he was being subjected to really started to knock him out,

795
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:32,879
the interrogations got more intense.

796
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:38,920
SGT. Salcedo, who was an inexperienced interrogator but a kind of can-do soldier ...

797
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,627
Had this man who refused to look at her because she was a woman.

798
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:46,873
She said she got very frustrated by this, and grabbed him by the sides of the face,

799
01:06:46,873 --> 01:06:50,829
And sort of turned him to face her and look at her, and take her seriously.

800
01:06:50,829 --> 01:07:00,919
But, of course, he was an Afghan man from a tribal, conservative culture, who didn't look at strange women.

801
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:04,353
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] SGT. Salcedo was getting a little aggravated.

802
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,586
So I kind of stepped in between them. And that's when I grabbed him by the shirt.

803
01:07:08,586 --> 01:07:11,465
And I brought him over to the wall.

804
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:15,413
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] They tried to make him stand up against the wall, and he was sliding down.

805
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:17,204
They pushed him back against the wall.

806
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:21,764
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] He wasn't making any kind of sense. Most of it seemed to just be rambling.

807
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:27,523
The interpreter was telling me that his wife came to visit him in his cell.

808
01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:32,701
Which, of course, didn't happen.

809
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:37,053
[PFC. Damien Corsetti, Mil-Intel, Bagram] If you've ever seen anybody sleep-depped,

810
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:41,406
ugh, past two days they begin to just be bumbling idiots.

811
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:45,571
Three days they are just worthless.

812
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:48,586
[SPC. Glendale Walls, Interrogated Dilawar at Bagram] I knew something was wrong.

813
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,926
And the next thing I heard was that he died.

814
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:56,268
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] Not long after Dilawar was killed,

815
01:07:56,268 --> 01:08:01,989
We learned that the Afghan guerilla commander, whose men had arrested Dilawar and the others,

816
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:05,416
had in fact been detained by the Americans himself.

817
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,634
And it turned out that he was rocketing their base,

818
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:12,454
And then picking up innocent Afghans and turning them over to the Americans.

819
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:16,124
Essentially to try and ingratiate himself with U.S. forces.

820
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:26,235
The three passengers were sent to Guantanamo. And they didn't get out until March of 2004,

821
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:30,435
Which was 15 months after they had been captured riding in the taxi.

822
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:38,745
It's hard to know what reason the Americans would have had to send these guys on

823
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:47,291
When they had quite clearly concluded that Dilawar, at least, was an innocent man when he was killed.

824
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:57,069
It certainly makes you wonder about whether they just sent these guys on to cover their butts.

825
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,162
Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who would cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportunity,

826
01:09:00,162 --> 01:09:02,223
the Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevailing rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal punishment...

827
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:04,134
Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2006

828
01:09:04,134 --> 01:09:07,785
[Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense] "These" are not mere innocents. "These" are among the worst of the worst.

829
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:16,291
"These" are among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.

830
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:18,245
[Dick Cheney, Vice-President] "They" are terrorists. "They" are bombmakers.

831
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:21,740
"They" are facilitators of terror. "They" are members of al Qaeda, the Taliban.

832
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,281
[Ari Fleischer, Bush White House Press Secretary] And if "they" were free, they would engage in murder once again.

833
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:28,291
["President" George W. Bush] The only thing I know for certain is that "these" are bad people.

834
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:32,957
[Tom Wilner, Lawyer For 11 Kuwaitis in Guantanamo] Despite Rumsfeld's and Cheney's and President Bush's allegations

835
01:09:32,957 --> 01:09:36,534
that "these guys" are the worst of the worst, that they were all captured on the battlefield,

836
01:09:36,534 --> 01:09:40,980
Recent studies of the whole compendium of Government's documents show

837
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:45,104
that only five percent of these people were picked up by the United States.

838
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:49,912
Only 8% of them are accused of being members of the al Qaeda.

839
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:56,772
Over 90% of them were picked up by Northern Alliance or Pakistani forces in exchange for bounties.

840
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:59,590
[Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense] We have LARGE rewards out.

841
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:06,853
We have leaflets that are dropping like snowflakes in December in Chicago.

842
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:12,068
An analysis of declassified government documents revealed that only

843
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:17,331
7% of Guantanamo detainees were captured by U.S. and Coalition forces.

844
01:10:17,452 --> 01:10:24,299
The other 93%, like Dilawar and his passengers, were turned over by Afghan warlords and Pakistanis.

845
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:28,559
Sometimes for cash payments of thousands of dollars.

846
01:10:29,285 --> 01:10:33,791
[John Yoo, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003] You know, the Military is not interested in spending whatever it is...$40,000 a year

847
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:38,072
Detaining people who are not members of al Qaeda in Guantanamo Bay.

848
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:43,794
It has as much interest as everyone else does in making sure that people who are detained are actually members of al Qaeda,

849
01:10:43,794 --> 01:10:47,837
rather than wasting resources and time detaining innocent people.

850
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:51,690
[Tom Wilner, Lawyer For 11 Kuwaitis in Guantanamo] I think it's natural in times of war to pick up people.

851
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:55,036
You want to pick up anyone you suspect of being dangerous.

852
01:10:55,036 --> 01:11:01,002
What's different here is that the Government, for the first time in our history didn't follow its own regulations,

853
01:11:01,002 --> 01:11:05,844
which require that a hearing be held, promptly after capture, if there is any doubt.

854
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,845
[Major Dan Mori, Military Defense Law for Guantanamo detainee David Hicks] In the war in Afgan, back in 2001,

855
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:12,981
the U.S. Military was prepared to follow the Geneva Conventions and conduct those tribunals.

856
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:17,166
Unfortunately, the civilian leadership within the Department of Defense, told them to stop.

857
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:21,845
Once somebody in Afgan might have said, "Okay, this person's a high-value target,"

858
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:27,641
for whatever reason. Whether it was based on some other Afghani who hated that person

859
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:30,252
and wanted him out so he could take over his opium crop.

860
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,065
Then that began the road to GTMO.

861
01:11:33,065 --> 01:11:39,117
And there was no way for that person to challenge it. And there still hasn't been.

862
01:11:40,341 --> 01:11:44,834
Moazzam Begg, a British subject suspected of ties to al Qaeda operatives,

863
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:48,420
was picked up by local intelligence agents in Pakistan.

864
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,017
[Moazzam Begg, Detained at Bagram and Guantanamo] I was in my house in Islamabad at the time that I was abducted.

865
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,272
A hood was placed over my head. My hands and legs were shackled.

866
01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:58,730
And I was physically carried into the back of the vehicle.

867
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:05,673
I didn't see my family again after that point. I was sent to Kandahar, and then to Bagram.

868
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:09,513
And when I was put onto the transport plane to Guantanamo.

869
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:14,401
I'd already been covered from almost head to toe in some sort of a covering:

870
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:17,153
Face mask, ear muffs, blackened goggles.

871
01:12:17,153 --> 01:12:21,200
And then, just in case I could see anything, a hood to cover it with.

872
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,456
Being seated in the aircraft was excruciatingly painful.

873
01:12:24,456 --> 01:12:27,666
They'd already used now the three-piece suit, and that is the shackle

874
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:30,273
That goes around the waist and is padlocked to the back.

875
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:34,507
It was impossible to move. Impossible to breathe properly. Impossible to hear anything.

876
01:12:34,507 --> 01:12:41,020
And so I managed to scream and plead with one of the guards to get me a needle to put me to sleep.

877
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:54,563
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] We fought for 2-1/2 years for just the right to go see the prisoners,

878
01:12:54,563 --> 01:13:00,180
and then fought for months more to get security clearance so the Military would let you in there.

879
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:06,559
I mean, this is bizarre! It never occurred to me that when I went to law school in America,

880
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:10,341
that we'd be sitting around talking about whether we could have access to our clients.

881
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:13,060
And whether our clients had been tortured!

882
01:13:13,296 --> 01:13:16,985
[Tom Wilner, Lawyer For 11 Kuwaitis in Guantanamo] Habeas corpus is really the essence of the rule of law.

883
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:21,216
Not giving people a basic hearing when you take away their liberty

884
01:13:21,216 --> 01:13:26,456
is one of the reasons we fought the revolution. That the King can't deprive somebody of liberty without a hearing!

885
01:13:26,456 --> 01:13:33,651
4. The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. Pp. 49~72.

886
01:13:33,651 --> 01:13:37,932
(a) The commission’s procedures, set forth in Commission Order No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to “close.” Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities, and “other national security interests.” Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer’s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client what took place therein. Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdan’s commission permit the admission of any evidence that, in the presiding officer’s opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person. Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other “protected information,” so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is “probative” and that its admission without the accused’s knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial. Pp. 49~52.

887
01:13:37,932 --> 01:13:42,642
(b) The Government objects to this Court’s consideration of a procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to law. These contentions are unsound. First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commission’s “final decision” under DTA §1005(e)(3). Second, there is a basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan’s trial will violate the law: He will be, and indeed already has been, excluded from his own trial. Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a “final decision” is appropriate. Pp. 52~53.

888
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:46,012
(c) Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan’s commission trial are illegal. The procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial. Although this uniformity principle is not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-martial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it. That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be “uniform insofar as practicable,” 10 U. S. C. §836(b). The “practicability” determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial. The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern “the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts” to Hamdan’s commission. The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial. And even if subsection (b)’s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsection’s requirements are not satisfied here. Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules here. There is no suggestion, e.g., of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility. It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan’s trial, any variance from the courts-martial rules. The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present. See 10 U. S. C. A. §839(c). Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as “practicable,” the courts-martial rules must apply. Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b). Pp. 53~62. ...Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2006

889
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:30,476
In 2004, 2-1/2 years after the first detainees had arrived in Guantanamo,

890
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:36,188
The Supreme Court rejected the Bush Administration's claims that it could hold detainees indefinitely

891
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:40,346
Without allowing them to challenge their detention in the courts.

892
01:14:40,346 --> 01:14:49,628
After the decision, the Military installed special new tribunals to judge whether detainees should remain in Guantanamo.

893
01:14:49,628 --> 01:14:54,061
[Tom Wilner, Lawyer For 11 Kuwaitis in Guantanamo] The Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which the Government hurriedly put in place

894
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:58,489
nine days after we won before the Supreme Court, are a joke!

895
01:14:58,489 --> 01:15:00,768
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] You have no rights! You have no right to a lawyer.

896
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:04,258
You have no meaningful right to witnesses. You don't really know what the charges are

897
01:15:04,258 --> 01:15:07,312
And you certainly don't know what the secret evidence is against you.

898
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:12,282
They may not ever know! But that doesn't eliminate the opportunity

899
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:16,896
they have to make a case for why, if they were returned in the future,

900
01:15:16,896 --> 01:15:19,283
why they would not continue to pose a threat.

901
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:24,509
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] Many of my clients are found not guilty at the CSRT Tribunals.

902
01:15:24,509 --> 01:15:29,987
And then the Military thinks that doesn't sound so good. They were being called "Not Enemy Combatants, NEC,

903
01:15:29,987 --> 01:15:34,870
But now they are NLEC, which means "No Longer Enemy Combatants,"

904
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,500
because we want to say they were guilty to begin with,

905
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,271
but now they've had a change of heart so they're not guilty anymore. But we were right in the first place.

906
01:15:41,271 --> 01:15:44,700
These men aren't necessarily innocent men.

907
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:51,161
That's not an accurate characterization. You're more accurate in their long title:

908
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:54,475
"No longer identified as an enemy combatant."

909
01:15:54,475 --> 01:15:58,153
They are being held separate from the remainder of the detainees

910
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:02,876
until the United States Government can find a country they can be returned to.

911
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:05,297
[Military PR guy] Some of these guys were policed off the battle field.

912
01:16:05,297 --> 01:16:11,207
And if they weren't here, they'd probably be on the battlefield killing American soldiers.

913
01:16:11,207 --> 01:16:15,536
They are here for a reason. And it's our job to insure that they stay here

914
01:16:15,536 --> 01:16:20,267
until such time as it's "deemed" that they don't need to be here any longer.

915
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:25,162
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] Guantanamo is hiding the fact that the really bad dudes...

916
01:16:25,162 --> 01:16:28,324
Aiman Al, and of course Osama bin Laden...have never been captured.

917
01:16:28,324 --> 01:16:36,196
So you have Guantanamo Bay as, "Here are 750 really evil guys" as a PR stunt, effectively.

918
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:39,031
To say, "Look, we're really achieving something in the war on terror."

919
01:17:00,848 --> 01:17:03,452
[PR Guy] And that is the main entrance to Camp X-Ray.

920
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,943
It would be extremely difficult for anybody to make an escape out of here.

921
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:12,791
Each one is 8 x 8 x 8. One individual per cell.

922
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:15,646
If you remember the individuals in the orange jumpsuits,

923
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:19,522
there's like three or four kneeling facing that way, and three or four kneeling facing that way.

924
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:22,387
If you take a shot from right here, you'll have the same image.

925
01:17:23,186 --> 01:17:27,037
And no detainee has ever died at GTMO from anything. *Since this interview 4 Guantanamo detainees have commited suicide

926
01:17:27,037 --> 01:17:30,536
And I think the doctors gave you an update: We've performed well over 100 surgeries.

927
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:37,150
So one good thing for them being here is they are quite healthy, and getting anything fixed they need getting fixed.

928
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:47,742
[PR Girl] We've introduced some new sports-type activities here in Camp 4.

929
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:50,413
We've recently built this half-basketball court.

930
01:17:50,413 --> 01:17:53,647
And off to the left of that, you will see a soccer court.

931
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:59,535
It is a privilege to live in Camp 4. They are compliant with the camp rules in order to live here.

932
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:04,186
And we have introduced things like cake on Wednesday nights.

933
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:07,316
Pepsi on Monday nights. Ice cream on Sunday nights.

934
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:10,095
Let's go in and take a look at the Bed.

935
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:12,895
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] On the bed, they have the so-called "CI's",

936
01:18:12,895 --> 01:18:18,488
or "comfort items," like a toothbrush! But also included is a game of Checkers.

937
01:18:18,488 --> 01:18:24,164
And I did ask them, "Who is my partner to play Checkers with?" He's in solitary confinement by himself.

938
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:29,191
What's the problem with the press photographing them?

939
01:18:29,191 --> 01:18:31,194
Talking with them? Observing them?

[Brigadier General Jay Hood, Commander Joint Task Force, Guantanamo 2004-2006] The desire to not provide a platform

941
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:45,888
To have the men we're holding espouse vile, Islamic rhetoric. A violent, vile, Islamic rhetoric!

942
01:18:55,776 --> 01:19:01,035
[PR Guy] This is a tactic of al Qaeda: hunger strike to elicit media attention,

943
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:04,749
and to bring pressure on the United States Government.

944
01:19:04,749 --> 01:19:09,412
When these numbers go up significantly, you guys start talking about it. You guys start asking about it.

945
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,780
* 81 detainees were on Hunger Strike during our tour So they understand that.

946
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,511
[PR Guy] Camp 5 is a 100-bed, maximum security segregation interrogation facility.

947
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:20,475
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] If they're held in Camp 5, an average day is always the same.

948
01:19:20,475 --> 01:19:25,805
Which is you're held 24 hours in solitary confinement.

949
01:19:25,892 --> 01:19:32,351
[Moazzam Begg, 20 months in isolation, Guantanamo] Here in the cell, it was 8' x 6', and I couldn't physically take 3 steps in any direction.

950
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,023
I certainly believed that I was going to spend the greater part of my life,

951
01:19:36,023 --> 01:19:39,808
and perhaps even face execution, which was what I was told quite often.

952
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:43,931
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] What's particularly pernicious in Guantanamo Bay

953
01:19:43,931 --> 01:19:46,787
is there is no sense of when it's going to end, or if it's going to end.

954
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:52,573
And the reason that prisoners go on hunger strike, for example, and may starve themselves to death,

955
01:19:52,573 --> 01:19:57,986
Is, in the words of Omar Deghayes, "I'm dying slowly here in Guantanamo as it is.

956
01:19:57,986 --> 01:20:01,008
So I may as well take my life into my own hands."

957
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:10,575
[Brigadier General Jay Hood, Commander Joint Task Force, Guantanamo 2004-2006] I have no intention of holding somebody here any longer than he is a threat to our country

958
01:20:10,575 --> 01:20:15,687
Or that he has intelligence or information that could be valuable to us in the global war on terror.

959
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:19,391
We continue to collect information of value from the men we're holding today.

960
01:20:25,164 --> 01:20:27,454
[Moazzam Begg, 20 months in isolation, Guantanamo] One of the reasons why I was held in isolation was

961
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:31,437
to do with this issue of witnessing these deaths in Bagram.

962
01:20:31,437 --> 01:20:35,079
And they asked me which soldiers had been involved, and where they were at the time.

963
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:37,745
And so they brought in photographs of the people from the unit.

964
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:41,429
And I pointed out who I believed was involved.

965
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:48,486
They asked me...one of the strangest requests I've ever had during the time I was in incarceration

966
01:20:48,486 --> 01:20:54,135
And that was, "Would I be willing to stand up as a witness for the prosecution in a trial against these soldiers?"

967
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:56,616
And I thought, "How ironic this is." You know.

968
01:20:56,616 --> 01:21:01,669
"Is this the only court that I'm going to get to see after all these years in incarceration?"

969
01:21:09,768 --> 01:21:15,189
The cruel ironies of the Dilawar story echoed an ongoing debate in the halls of Congress

970
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:20,448
about detainee abuse, national security, and the rule of law.

971
01:21:20,448 --> 01:21:24,074
For one senator, John McCain, a former prisoner of war,

972
01:21:24,074 --> 01:21:28,917
the matter of detainee abuse was both political and personal.

973
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:44,871
[John McCain, North Vietnam, 1968] I would just like to tell my wife I'm going to get well,

974
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:52,857
I love her, and I hope to see her soon.

975
01:21:52,857 --> 01:22:01,957
And I'd appreciate it if you'd tell her that. That's all.

976
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:10,262
[Jack Cloonan, FBI Special Agent 1977-2002] If this man, after 6-1/2 or 7 years of torture, says that it's not efficient,

977
01:22:10,262 --> 01:22:16,635
it's inhumane, and it breeds contempt for the United States,

978
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:22,018
He can stand up and be a moral voice on this issue.

979
01:22:22,018 --> 01:22:25,054
[Senator John McCain] We sent them to fight for us in Afgan and Iraq.

980
01:22:25,054 --> 01:22:29,781
We placed extraordinary pressure on them to extract intelligence from detainees.

981
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:34,006
But then we threw out the rules that our soldiers had trained on,

982
01:22:34,006 --> 01:22:39,328
and replaced them with a confusing and constantly changing array of standards.

983
01:22:39,328 --> 01:22:44,721
And when things went wrong, we blamed them. And we punished them.

984
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:48,288
I believe we have to do better than that.

985
01:22:48,288 --> 01:22:54,759
I strongly urge you to do justice to your men and women in uniform.

986
01:22:54,759 --> 01:23:01,096
Give them clear standards of conduct that reflect the ideals they risk their lives for.

987
01:23:03,926 --> 01:23:10,236
On October 5, 2005, as increasing numbers of detainee abuse cases came to trial.

988
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:14,078
Senator John McCain proposed the Detainee Treatment Act.

989
01:23:16,018 --> 01:23:22,065
The bill sought a total U.S. ban on torture. As well as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.

990
01:23:22,065 --> 01:23:28,576
And it sparked a national debate. One in which the Devil was in the details.

991
01:23:28,576 --> 01:23:33,102
[Senator John McCain] Is it still permissible to use a wet towel and dripping water

992
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:36,438
to induce the misperception of suffocation?

993
01:23:36,438 --> 01:23:40,073
[Lt. General Randall M. Schmidt, Author of "Schmidt Report"] The use of the wet towel, dripping water to induce the misperception of suffocation

994
01:23:40,073 --> 01:23:46,684
was one of the techniques requested by the JTF in their laundry list given up.

995
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:50,577
It was never approved. It has never been a technique approved.

996
01:23:51,187 --> 01:23:56,829
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] One of the techniques that made the transition from the regime of the physical to the psychological...

997
01:23:56,829 --> 01:24:01,895
in fact the only one...was waterboarding. Because in the medieval era, under the Inquisition,

998
01:24:01,895 --> 01:24:08,775
it was done because of its horrible, physical aspects. It was done to purge and punish the heretic.

999
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:14,919
You force water down the throat of the victim. The victim thinks that he's drowning. It's horrible.

1000
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:17,910
Your body tells you that you're dying.

1001
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:23,422
Right after 9/11, the CIA got approval from the White House for waterboarding.

1002
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:28,900
An early test case involved the interrogation of Ibn Sheikh al Libi,

1003
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,701
a man suspected of being the Emir of an al Qaeda training camp.

1004
01:24:33,351 --> 01:24:37,044
Initially, the FBI was in charge of his interrogation.

1005
01:24:37,044 --> 01:24:42,583
But the Administration was impatient with the slow results of the FBI's law enforcement techniques.

1006
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:45,972
So they turned al Libi over to the CIA.

1007
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:49,742
[Jack Cloonan, FBI Special Agent 1977-2002] He is secured. He was either duct-taped or hooded.

1008
01:24:49,742 --> 01:24:52,390
And he was going to be put into a box...

1009
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:58,887
a plywood box for his own protection [makes disbelief sound]...for transfer to the airport.

1010
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:01,298
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] They throw him on an aircraft, and they rendered him

1011
01:25:01,298 --> 01:25:04,369
through extraordinary rendition, to Egypt.

1012
01:25:05,003 --> 01:25:12,517
They later subjected him to two weeks of brutal torture, involving all of these techniques, including waterboarding.

1013
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:16,518
And they got information from al Libi stating

1014
01:25:16,518 --> 01:25:22,446
that Saddam Hussein's regime had trained al Qaeda in chemical and biological warfare.

1015
01:25:22,446 --> 01:25:28,247
[Scott Horton, Attorney] One of the things we know about torture is that someone who is tortured

1016
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:35,406
will tell his interrogator what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.

1017
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:37,850
[Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell] The moment al Libi was waterboarded,

1018
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:43,411
he started blurting things out. Well, rather than questioning what he was saying,

1019
01:25:43,411 --> 01:25:47,348
and going into it in detail to see if what he was saying could be corroborated,

1020
01:25:47,348 --> 01:25:52,776
they immediately stopped and ran off to report what al Libi had said.

1021
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:57,472
And ended the torture. And bang...it gets up to the highest decision-makers

1022
01:25:57,472 --> 01:26:02,353
And all of a sudden Colin Powell is told, "Hey, you don't have to worry about your doubts anymore,

1023
01:26:02,353 --> 01:26:07,765
because we've just gotten confirmation that there were contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad.

1024
01:26:08,982 --> 01:26:18,701
In February, 2003, then Secretary of State Colin Powell went before the United Nations to make the case for the war in Iraq.

1025
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:22,066
[Colin Powell, Secretary of State] I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative

1026
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:27,242
telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al Qaeda.

1027
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:32,454
Fortunately, this operative is now detained, and he has told his story.

1028
01:26:32,994 --> 01:26:38,097
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] A year later, the CIA branded al Libi a fabricator,

1029
01:26:38,097 --> 01:26:42,286
and rescinded all of the intelligence reports with that information in it.

1030
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:47,012
So, in other words, you will get information, but you'll get false information.

1031
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:53,293
[Scott Horton, Attorney] I think Colin Powell said that was the most embarrassing day of his entire life.

1032
01:26:56,216 --> 01:27:02,564
[Rear Admiral John Hutson (ret) Judge Advocate General] All the experts say that torturing people is not the best way to get information.

1033
01:27:03,254 --> 01:27:11,812
Breaking down the barriers between you and them, gaining their confidence is the best way to get it.

1034
01:27:11,812 --> 01:27:15,476
It takes some experience. It takes some talent. It takes some patience.

1035
01:27:15,476 --> 01:27:19,558
And then they might actually tell you something that is worthwhile.

1036
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:22,560
And then if you want to prosecute them and execute them, go ahead.

1037
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,852
[Jack Cloonan, Counterterrorism Task Force] If you want to be able to build a rapport with somebody,

1038
01:27:25,852 --> 01:27:31,612
You are their salvation, because their life as they know it is over.

1039
01:27:32,184 --> 01:27:35,907
"Is there something I can do for your kids? You concerned about them?

1040
01:27:35,907 --> 01:27:39,262
Do you want them educated? I'll get them educated.

1041
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:47,519
What do you want? Tell me what you want. Script for me your exit strategy."

1042
01:27:47,519 --> 01:27:53,391
"How do you extricate yourself from this terrible situation that, by the way, you put yourself in?"

1043
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:58,150
"Now, you can't go back home, can you?

1044
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:04,644
No. So let's make peace with that. Let me help you find the strategy to give you a life."

1045
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:08,135
And that's the way it worked!

1046
01:28:08,135 --> 01:28:13,102
The amount of information that they were able to provide us, pre-9/11,

1047
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:20,602
to me it was extremely valuable. Who else was going to tell us about how you joined al Qaeda?

1048
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:24,740
What did buy-out mean? How did they communicate?

1049
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:29,422
Did they use Emaar-set satellite phones. Did Bin Laden use a body double?

1050
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:34,840
So when we got all that information, we were able to do certain operations.

1051
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,555
Cumbersome though it may be, it still to me was the way to do it.

1052
01:28:39,555 --> 01:28:43,224
And we don't have to apologize to anybody.

1053
01:28:44,383 --> 01:28:47,484
We don't know what revenge is coming down the road.

1054
01:28:47,484 --> 01:28:54,204
And if I wanted to incite the faithful, I'd just take that one picture with the dog collar on,

1055
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:57,290
and just point to that. And look at the young brothers and say,

1056
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,869
"You're duty bound now to get revenge."

1057
01:29:04,354 --> 01:29:09,067
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] The advocates of torture generally focus on the hypothetical.

1058
01:29:09,067 --> 01:29:11,879
They have this ticking bomb scenario they talk about ...

1059
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:15,562
[Clive Stafford Smith, lawyer for Guantanamo detainees] which is, imagine that there's a ticking time bomb in Times Square.

1060
01:29:15,562 --> 01:29:18,433
It's about to go off. We've got the guy in custody.

1061
01:29:18,433 --> 01:29:22,579
He says he wants a lawyer. Do we respect his right to a lawyer?

1062
01:29:22,579 --> 01:29:26,472
Or to save a million lives do we apply the electrodes to his testicles?

1063
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:39,107
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] 24, week after week, has on-camera displays of brutal torture ...

1064
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,228
[Kiefer Sutherland] Just tell me what your connection with the terrorists is?

1065
01:29:41,228 --> 01:29:48,107
designed to stop some terrorist with a ticking bomb from killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans.

1066
01:29:48,107 --> 01:29:49,684
[Superior] You're talking about torturing this man?

1067
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,362
[Kiefer Sutherland] I'm talking about doing what is necessary to stop this warhead from being used against us.

1068
01:29:53,362 --> 01:29:55,693
[Clive Stafford Smith, Lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, including Moazzam Begg] It's just nonsense, though! Because then you ask,

1069
01:29:55,693 --> 01:30:01,924
"Hey, name me one time in the last 500 years when we've had someone in custody with a ticking time bomb?"

1070
01:30:01,924 --> 01:30:07,479
[Jack Cloonan, Counterterrorism Task Force] The likelihood of that ever happening is so remote.

1071
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:13,857
Even if you're in that situation, who is to say if you beat 'em up, that you're going to get that information?

1072
01:30:13,857 --> 01:30:17,769
If a guy is that committed, I think he'll die before he gives it up.

1073
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:22,040
[Professor Alfred McCoy, author A Question of Torture] Right after the release of the Abu Ghraib photos in mid-2004,

1074
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:27,717
35% of Americans polled believed that torture was acceptable under some circumstances.

1075
01:30:28,273 --> 01:30:31,211
Even after the Abu Ghraib photographs.

1076
01:30:31,211 --> 01:30:37,234
And I think that shows the way that this kind of popular culture has built a constituency for torture,

1077
01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:43,220
which allows the Bush White House to get away with the way it twists laws and treaties,

1078
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:46,548
and doesn't spark popular outrage.

1079
01:30:46,548 --> 01:30:49,409
On a conservative radio show,

1080
01:30:49,409 --> 01:30:54,440
Vice-President Dick Cheney openly defended the practice of waterboarding.

1081
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:58,037
[Scott Hennen, WDAY North Dakota] Would you agree, a dunk in water is a no-brainer if it can save lives?

1082
01:30:58,037 --> 01:31:02,201
[Dick Cheney, Vice President] Well, um, it's a no-brainer for me,

1083
01:31:02,201 --> 01:31:06,116
but for a while there I was criticized as being the Vice President for torture.

1084
01:31:06,832 --> 01:31:09,826
["President" George W. Bush] We do not condone torture!

1085
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:13,404
[Scott Horton, Attorney] "We do not torture"! Footnote: "As we define torture.

1086
01:31:13,404 --> 01:31:16,827
Which means exactly what we wish it to mean, and nothing else."

1087
01:31:17,301 --> 01:31:25,999
In the elections of 2006, the Bush Administration openly campaigned for harsh techniques the rest of the world defined as torture.

1088
01:31:26,374 --> 01:31:30,020
Bush and Cheney played on the fears of voters and politicians.

1089
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:37,436
If Congress didn't give them the power to do whatever was necessary, how could Americans be safe?

1090
01:31:37,436 --> 01:31:42,748
["President" George W. Bush] In addition to the terrorists held at Guantanamo, a small number of suspected terrorist leaders

1091
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:49,150
and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside the United States

1092
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:54,088
in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

1093
01:31:54,888 --> 01:31:58,992
Some ask, "Why you are acknowledging this program now?"

1094
01:31:59,522 --> 01:32:05,316
Some believe our Military and Intelligence personnel involved in capturing and questioning terrorists

1095
01:32:05,316 --> 01:32:11,015
could now be at risk of prosecution under the War Crimes Act!

1096
01:32:11,015 --> 01:32:14,715
Simply for doing their jobs in a thorough and professional way!

1097
01:32:15,271 --> 01:32:17,550
This is unacceptable!

1098
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:25,299
The President was forced to disclose his secret CIA program when the Supreme Court acted to limit his wartime powers.

1099
01:32:25,299 --> 01:32:28,217
In the historic Hamdan decision,

1100
01:32:28,217 --> 01:32:34,677
the Court ruled that interrogations and trials of terrorists would be governed by the Geneva Conventions.

1101
01:32:34,677 --> 01:32:41,974
["President" George W. Bush] This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said we must conduct ourselves

1102
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:45,496
under the Common Article III of the Geneva Convention.

1103
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:52,290
And that Common Article III says that there will be no outrages upon human dignity.

1104
01:32:53,447 --> 01:32:58,427
It's a, it's a, it's a, like...it's very vague! What does that mean?

1105
01:33:02,965 --> 01:33:05,776
[Senator Carl Levin, Senate Armed Services Committee] Do you believe that the use of testimony

1106
01:33:05,776 --> 01:33:12,924
which is obtained through techniques such as waterboarding, stress positions, intimidating use of military dogs,

1107
01:33:12,924 --> 01:33:19,515
sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, forced nudity would be consistent with Common Article III?

1108
01:33:19,515 --> 01:33:25,016
[Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General] Well, sir, I think that most importantly, I can't imagine that such testimony would be reliable.

1109
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:32,524
[Senator John McCain] Mr. Attorney General, do you believe that statements obtained through illegal, inhumane treatment should be admissible?

1110
01:33:43,814 --> 01:33:57,241
[Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General] Senator, well, again...I'll say this: the concern I would have about such a prohibition is,

1111
01:33:57,241 --> 01:33:59,509
"What does it mean?" "How do you define it?"

1112
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:04,287
And WHO would define it? The Bush Administration introduced a new law

1113
01:34:04,287 --> 01:34:07,792
that would elude the restrictions of the Supreme Court.

1114
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:11,816
[Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell] In a legal sense, I think they wanted to discard the Constitution.

1115
01:34:11,816 --> 01:34:15,100
And they wanted to write a new one. But you can't do that.

1116
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,946
So what you do is you throw a new interpretation on the old one.

1117
01:34:17,946 --> 01:34:21,295
And the new interpretation is the Executive in wartime

1118
01:34:21,295 --> 01:34:26,728
And perhaps this war is going to last forever...is all powerful.

1119
01:34:27,526 --> 01:34:30,754
Congress gave the President most of what he wanted.

1120
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:37,353
He would agree to abide by the Geneva Conventions so long as HE could define their meaning and application.

1121
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:46,479
A few detainees at Guantanamo might be put on trial. But the rest would no longer have access to habeas corpus:

1122
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:50,473
The fundamental legal right to challenge their detention.

1123
01:34:52,503 --> 01:34:57,236
Planning a run for President, even Senator McCain voted for the bill

1124
01:34:57,236 --> 01:35:02,417
soon after the Bush Administration threatened to discredit him with Conservative voters.

1125
01:35:02,417 --> 01:35:09,318
[The Cafferty File...Immunity from War Crimes?] Buried deep inside this legislation is a provision that will pardon President Bush

1126
01:35:09,318 --> 01:35:12,889
and all the members of his Administration of any possible crimes

1127
01:35:12,889 --> 01:35:19,738
connected to the torture and mistreatment of detainees dated all the way back to September 11, 2001.

1128
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:25,079
At least President Nixon had Gerald Ford to do his dirty work. President Bush is trying to pardon himself.

1129
01:35:26,325 --> 01:35:31,135
The pardon did not extend to frontline soldiers.

1130
01:35:31,135 --> 01:35:36,777
[PFC. Willie Brand, Convicted: Assault, Maiming, Maltreatment] The trial was a very confusing time for me, because I've never been through a trial before.

1131
01:35:36,777 --> 01:35:42,277
I didn't know what was really going on. I kind of just understood that, you know,

1132
01:35:42,277 --> 01:35:45,533
I was facing a lot of time in jail. That's the only thing I really understood about the whole thing.

1133
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:54,021
[SGT. Anthony Morden, Pled Guilty to: Assault, Dereliction of Duty] Well, I was sent to jail, to a Military Correctional facility.

1134
01:35:54,021 --> 01:36:01,921
I've lost my full-time job. I have a bad-conduct discharge

1135
01:36:01,921 --> 01:36:07,291
Wwhich has hindered me in getting a new job in the same field.

1136
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:14,720
I...financially it's just devastated me.

1137
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:20,587
I'm just glad it's over. That's it. Glad I can get on with my life.

1138
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:29,631
I had to plead guilty to assault, and two counts of dereliction of duty.

1139
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:35,340
In exchange, they would say that I could go to jail for no more than four months.

1140
01:36:36,036 --> 01:36:39,254
Rather than spend the money that was being spent for that trial,

1141
01:36:39,254 --> 01:36:43,792
I think it could have been better spent in working on Army doctrine to make sure that other people

1142
01:36:43,792 --> 01:36:53,586
go into battle properly equipped, properly led, and with a full understanding as to what their new roles and responsibilities are.

1143
01:36:55,413 --> 01:37:00,016
[William Cassara, Damien Corsetti's Attorney] When a detainee is abused, or a detainee claims abuse,

1144
01:37:00,016 --> 01:37:02,782
they want somebody to take the fall for it.

1145
01:37:02,782 --> 01:37:06,626
And it's not going to be the person with eagles or stars on their shoulder.

1146
01:37:07,206 --> 01:37:12,827
No officer was ever convicted in the Dilawar case.

1147
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:17,977
Following her service at Abu Ghraib, Capt. Carolyn Wood was given a staff position

1148
01:37:17,977 --> 01:37:23,078
at the Army Interrogation School in Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

1149
01:37:23,078 --> 01:37:29,179
[Scott Horton, Attorney] What does that reflect in terms of Senior Leadership's intentions?

1150
01:37:29,179 --> 01:37:35,955
Not to eradicate the abuse, but to perpetuate the abuse.

1151
01:37:35,955 --> 01:37:40,990
I think the probabilities exist that there will be other terrorist attacks. That more Americans will die.

1152
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:45,764
And the argument that we have to apply abuse to detainees in order to protect American lives,

1153
01:37:45,764 --> 01:37:52,050
I find to be violative of our deepest values And to the very safety of our country.

1154
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:56,551
We fight not only to protect lives. We fight to protect our principles.

1155
01:37:56,941 --> 01:38:00,091
[Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell] If you say, over the course of Afgan,

1156
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:06,215
GTMO and Iraq, we've detained 50,000 people, I'd say that less than 1% were terrorists.

1157
01:38:13,136 --> 01:38:16,519
Were some of them insurgents? Probably.

1158
01:38:16,519 --> 01:38:22,303
Were almost all of them in Iraq, in particular, going to become insurgents after their treatment? Yes.

1159
01:38:22,303 --> 01:38:25,724
[Moazzam Begg, Detained at Bagram and Guantanamo] I was kidnapped, abducted, forced into prison,

1160
01:38:25,724 --> 01:38:31,563
tortured, and threatened with further torture, without charge. Without trial.

1161
01:38:33,063 --> 01:38:36,062
Even many soldiers had said to me afterward,

1162
01:38:36,062 --> 01:38:40,035
"Wasn't it hell when you weren't a terrorist when you came in here, by the time you leave,

1163
01:38:40,035 --> 01:38:43,071
I'm sure you would be because of the way you've been treated."

1164
01:38:45,637 --> 01:38:48,661
[Jack Cloonan, Counterterrorism Task Force] I think there's a certain level of prejudice

1165
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:54,380
that this religion, and the people who have hijacked it,

1166
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:59,686
have such a disregard for life, that we turn around and say,

1167
01:38:59,686 --> 01:39:10,270
"If they think so very little of life...and clearly 9/11 exemplified that...screw them!" Anything goes."

1168
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:12,010
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] It's not surprising that at the end of all this, Dilawar, the victim, was really lost.

1169
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:17,559
I mean, Dilawar was almost invisible in the trials. I mean, you never saw pictures of him.

1170
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:23,303
Nobody ever mentioned this man's wife and child who were left without a husband and father.

1171
01:40:23,581 --> 01:40:26,948
He was not part of the picture at all.

1172
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:50,230
[Tim Golden, New York Times Reporter] There's a lot of other people out there who are going to run into this system unless it's fixed.

1173
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:57,316
And you only need one to sort of remind yourself of what it's capable of.

1174
01:41:18,142 --> 01:41:24,335
[Alberto Mora, former Navy General Counsel] American values are premised upon the notion of human dignity, and the sanctity of the individual.

1175
01:41:24,335 --> 01:41:29,916
To allow for cruelty to be applied as a matter of official policy,

1176
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:35,325
is to say that our forefathers were wrong about these inalienable rights.

1177
01:41:36,525 --> 01:41:42,231
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Mil-Intel, Iraq] Americans obviously want to believe that we're somehow more moral than the rest of the world.

1178
01:41:42,231 --> 01:41:45,279
For some reason we have a real strong desire to feel that way.

1179
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:49,079
And I think that's eroding. I don't really know what effect that's going to have on us.

1180
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:56,373
And I think a lot of people have just decided, "Well, you know, it's different now after 9/11.

1181
01:41:56,373 --> 01:42:01,169
We can't be good anymore. We have to get tough."

1182
01:42:01,169 --> 01:42:03,921
And so we'll have to see what that does to us.

1183
01:42:03,921 --> 01:42:05,111
What do you say?

1184
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:07,821
[SPC. Tony Lagouranis, Mil-Intel, Iraq] I think that's bullshit, frankly.

1185
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:13,949
I mean, I think that we still need to try and be as good as we can be.

1186
01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:32,449
[Frank B. Gibney] I find it utterly inconceivable that our highest officials...

1187
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:40,596
Rumsfeld, Bush and Cheney...would not only countenance torture but would actually advocate it.

1188
01:42:40,596 --> 01:42:45,126
That really destroyed my faith in the American government.

1189
01:42:45,126 --> 01:42:50,532
Because through World War II and the Korean War, where I also served,

1190
01:42:50,532 --> 01:42:55,292
We had the sense that we were on the side of the good guys.

1191
01:42:55,292 --> 01:42:59,053
You'd always get justice from the United States of America.

1192
01:42:59,053 --> 01:43:03,778
People would get decent treatment. And there was a rule of law.

1193
01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:09,953
We never forgot that. That behind the facade of wartime hatreds,

1194
01:43:09,953 --> 01:43:15,125
There was a central rule of law which people abided by.

1195
01:43:16,048 --> 01:43:20,951
It was something we believed. It was what made America different.

1196
