00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,602
Fucking did it.
We bought a boat.

3
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,008
Drink.

4
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,508
I dub thee, Bitch Slayer.

5
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,543
We're retired,
a little early retirement.

6
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,987
- Yeah, the company
that went under.
- Whatever.

7
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,513
Look at that shit.

8
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,356
Look at that, man.

9
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,554
I'm out.

10
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,962
Hmm.

11
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,529
I got it.
I got it.

12
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,131
Okay. okay.

13
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,131

14
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,869

You got it.

15
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,433
ome on, man,

16
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,070
ate, irst.

17
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,441
[rock music]

18
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,950
[distant splash]

19
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,959
Okay, I got 'em.

20
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,888
heldon.

21
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,095
ow, how did he get past me

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,161
other 
He's not small.

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,605
[rock music]

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,420
[distant splash]

25
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,995
[creature roaring]

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,461
ominous music

27
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,993
o there's strong
scientiic evidence

28
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,298
that octopi are smaer
than dolphins.

29
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,328
o why in the deepest
pas o the ocean

30
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,238
couldn't there be similar animals,

31
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,676
,, even a hundred times
more intelligent.

32
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,440
ut how could anything
but microbes

33
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,573
survive in those
kind of conditions?

34
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,674
I assure you.

35
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,618
Things dwell at the bottom of the
sea that are far more sinister

36
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,248
than the human mind
would care to imagine.

37
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,448
[knocking at the door]

38
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,653
I'm sorry, class.
Something has come up.

39
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,855
We will pick up
from there tomorrow.

40
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,725
What's this all about?

41
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,130
I don't know, but it came
straight from the council.

42
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,657
The council hasn't been
in session for years.

43
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,672
Good, Lake, you're here.

44
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,807
I believe the sister relic
has been found.

45
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,410
The cult has been working
to secure the relic.

46
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,945
If they have succeeded
in finding the other half,

47
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,859
mankind could be in for short
and devastated war.

48
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,228
The relic must not be rejoined.

49
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:37,794
Our piece must be delivered to
a descendant of H.P.. Lovecraft.

50
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:46,735
Lake, this task has been
appointed to you.

51
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,804
What?

52
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,780
But why?

53
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,750
I'm the least experienced
of the council.

54
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,719
I haven't had weapons
training in 15 years.

55
00:05:54,754 --> 00:06:00,954
This is true but all of us are
well beyond our days of adventure.

56
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,453
Lake, for countless of ages, we
have fought to keep mankind safe

57
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:11,300
from the horrors hidden and waiting
in the dark places of the earth.

58
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,568
Your time has come.

59
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,937
But alone what
chance do I have?

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,174
Not much.

61
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,151
My money is on you being
brutality killed within two days.

62
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,086
But what choice do we have?

63
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,285
The relic must be delivered,

64
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,022
or all hope is lost.

65
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,394
So be it.

66
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,331
Who's next in the bloodline?

67
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,158
[phone ringing]

68
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,329
Sqrly Sqrl Gift Baskets,
this is Jeff.

69
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,033
May I take your order?

70
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,033
I...I'm so...I'm sorry, ma'am.

71
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,239
No, no, no.
I understand.

72
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,577
Yes.

73
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,344
Ok...okay.

74
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,412
Yeah.
All right.

75
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,353
Look into my eyes.

76
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,255
Ah-hum

77
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,652
Damn it, Charlie!

78
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,853
What the hell is this?

79
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,989
That's Mr. Sqrly Sqrl
with a chainsaw,,

80
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,896
buzzin' prices.

81
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,163
Not company protocol.

82
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:16,634
Okay.

83
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,604
And what did I say about
bringing those things into work.

84
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,073
That I should because they're
entertaining and aw,esome.

85
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,542
Don't be a smart ass, Charlie.

86
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,104
Oh, I think, sir,
I feel a moment here.

87
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,206
It's you and Skelly Man.

88
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,910
Your eyes, they're meeting.
It's meeting.

89
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,385
There's hatred but
Skelly Man says "l don't hate."

90
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,912
Why can't you just take care of
your shit like your co-worker,
Jeff, over there.

91
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,257
Well, sir, that's because
Jeffy-boy after whittling aw,ay
in this cubicle all day,

92
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,627
comes home and locks
himself in his room

93
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,794
where he starts to make a slow
kind of gentle love to himself.

94
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,327
It's like this moaning like,
like a...hmmm.

95
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,167
Do you knowwhat I mean?
Like, hmmm.

96
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,266
Mr. Russell, you're over sharing.

97
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,140
You're an asshole, Charlie.

98
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,474
Hostile, too.

99
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,106
Just get your work done,
gentleman,

100
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,981
and if I see one of those things
anywhere near your desk,

101
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,006
you're fired.

102
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,384
Hey, happy birthday, big guy.

103
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,125
Is this really my freaking life?

104
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,564
Hey, man, are you happy stuck
in this shitty cubicle all day?

105
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,435
God!

106
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,099
Stop talking!

107
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,697
Okay!

108
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,141
Stop it, you guys.
I'm working here.

109
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,145
This is a place of buis...

110
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,409
Nobody gives a shit
about your high score, Henry.

111
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,245
Ah-hum.

112
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,015
Mother FucKer.

113
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,914
Hey, cheer up, man.

114
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,859
Think about that comic book
we're going to sell.

115
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,157
Dude, that's your
little dream, man.

116
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,891
I don't even like comic books.

117
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,661
And what...you started draw,ing
that thing like six months ago,

118
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,292
and you have like
two pages done.

119
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,269
Hey, those were sweet pages.

120
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,271
Take a look at those back--

121
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,899
Besides, there's a
bunch of shit we could do.

122
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,067
Who cares?

123
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,167
Yeah, like what?

124
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,842
I don't know, like...Iike getting our
pee-pee sucked by that goddess.

125
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,747
Is she coming
over here right now?

126
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,412
P.Iease, please, please,
just don't be an idiot this time.

127
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,977
P.Iease, keep your fucking idiot..

128
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,421
- P.ut that stupid thing aw,ay.
- Shh. Shh.

129
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,684
Hi, boys.

130
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,748
Hey, Susie.

131
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,250
Um, hey, Jeff, I was wondering if
you want to come to my place

132
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:28,199
this weekend to help me
with all these paperwork.

133
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,633
-Ah...um...this weekend?
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,732
Actually, it's kind of weird,
me and Charlie were

135
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,243
working on this whole
comic book thing so

136
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,904
kind of booked up,

137
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,278
but maybe I can stop by your
cubicle on Monday

138
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,375
and we can go over all the
paperwork and everything.

139
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,282
Would that be all right?

140
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,345
Ah...okay.

141
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,549
Sure.
That's too bad.

142
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,615
See you guys later.

143
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,956
Okay.
Bye, Susie.

144
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,121
I think that went well.

145
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,096
I like her a lot.

146
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,156
I should kill you
with my stapler right now.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,225
I'm going to put staple
in each of your eyes.

148
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,896
No, it's just, you know, the whole
timing thing wasn't right, so.

149
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,566
Yeah 'cause I'm pretty sure Susie
wanted to move into pee-pee town

150
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,075
and you said no thanks.

151
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,509
No, it's because we have plans to
plan the whole comic book thing.

152
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,809
You know what, an hour ago
you didn't want to do the comic.

153
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,907
Whatever, man.
I'm just saying you better hope
juicy little Susie is a necrophiliac

154
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,144
by the time you get around to it.

155
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:19,776
Fuck you, man.

156
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,810
When was the last time
you even got laid, anyway?

157
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,219
How about last weekend?

158
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,415
Bullshit. Who?

159
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,651
Nicki from accounting.

160
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,022
Oh my God, I'm so close...

161
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,822
I'm so close...don't stop
where you're taking me to!

162
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,761
Oh my God, I'm so close!
Don't... Don't...

163
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,763
Ow!

164
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,396
Hey, be careful.
That's a collectible.

165
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,162
What about my eye?

166
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,669
Ah...first edition.

167
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,261
Are you joking?

168
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,967
Why don't you go fuck
your stupid toy then, asshole?

169
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,202
God.

170
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,612
Let's just say she thought
I was quite the freak.

171
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,640
Great, bro.
That's just one more girl at work

172
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,311
that I'm not going to be
able to make eye contact with

173
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,183
because I know
I live with you, dude.

174
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,655
- You're kind of a pussy.
- I'm not a pussy.

175
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,452
Long have we aw,aited
your return.

176
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,548
Now, that we have recovered
a portion of the relic,

177
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,491
it has allowed us to release you.

178
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,496
Who is your leader?

179
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,958
I am.

180
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,869
Who is your leader?

181
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,175
We only serve one master.

182
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,184
I have summoned the last
of the ancient Deep Ones.

183
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,686
They are still half a day's
journey from shore.

184
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:08,217
So until their arrival,
you will all...suffice.

185
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,524
Now, bring me the relic.

186
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,871
Nice shirt.

187
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,966
[growls]

188
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,017
This half signifies
the beginning of a newworld.

189
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:37,386
No man shall prevent the second
coming of the great Old Ones.

190
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,291
Once again,
our time is upon us.

191
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,634
Dude, what's this?

192
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,662
A comic book that I actually
bought foryour birthday

193
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,106
but you found it early.

194
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,906
Goblin Wizards number 63, dude?

195
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,774
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

196
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,403
Happy birthday.

197
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,777
Look at them.
I'm so happy, man.

198
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,873
It reminds me of
how you used to be.

199
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,315
What is that supposed to mean?

200
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,683
You've never done the splits
in the air but

201
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,210
you know, he's happy,

202
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,155
shooting a little mother
fucking magic into the world.

203
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,317
No, I just live in reality.

204
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,328
I mean, yeah, I may drive a fucking
carwith a squirrel on the side of it,

205
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,488
but otherthan that, dude.

206
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,090
Yeah, no, I mean,
you're like the...you know,

207
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,225
you're like that smiley, happy.

208
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,668
I don't fucking live in a little
dream land like you do,

209
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,171
so just take your comic book
and say thanks.

210
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,037
- Okay. Happy birthday.
- Dude, this is aw,esome.

211
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,632
- Thank you, bro.
- That's all I want to hear, bro.

212
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,906
- It's cool. Cool.
- All right. Cool, man. Thanks, dude.

213
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,708
- You like it?
- Yeah, I'm thrilled.

214
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,887
Hey, Jeff, there's some
old guy in our apartment.

215
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,254
Oh, yeah. How old?

216
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,316
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him?

217
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,951
What the hell.

218
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,484
How did you even
get in here, man?

219
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,793
Is one of you Jeff P.hillips?

220
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,200
Thanks, bro.

221
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,929
Yeah, I'm Jeff.

222
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,700
Do I knowyou 'cause you
just broke into our house.

223
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,673
I don't have much time.

224
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,836
The Council of Cthulhu has sent me
to give you an ancient relic,

225
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,847
one you must risk your life
to protect.

226
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,781
Mm-hmm.
Well, here's athought.

227
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,649
Why don't you go back to your
little cardboard box or whatever
you craw,led out of

228
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,347
and then I won't have to
call the cops.

229
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,378
I wish it were that simple.

230
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,721
I know this will be hard
for you to believe.

231
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,818
Have you heard of
the author H.P.. Lovecraft?

232
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,993
Ah...he's onlythe forefather
of modern horror, so yeah.

233
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,764
Why I'm I not surprised you
know what he's talking about.

234
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,398
Jeff, you're the end
of a great bloodline,

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,432
the last living relative
of Lovecraft himself.

236
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,704
Listen, okay.

237
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,507
Lovecraft wrote about this.

238
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,379
There are people who say they
have firsthand account of,

239
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,883
of these monsters that
the mere knowledge of

240
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,819
would drive a man insane.

241
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,880
Lovecraft disguised the truth
of these nightmares as fiction

242
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,291
and formed a secret society
to stand against them.

243
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,421
Okay. Well, while you guys are
doing little comic book party here,

244
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,988
I'm going to go dial 911.

245
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:04,059
I'm not talking...
Comic books, comic books.

246
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,866
Wait, wait, wait a second.

247
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,644
Here it is.

248
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,547
Tales of the Deep issue 171,

249
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,881
The Rise and Fall of Cthulhu.

250
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,716
It's all in here, man.

251
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,517
Check it out.

252
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,786
Millions of years ago when
the earth was in its infancy,

253
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,626
Cthulhu and his minions
came From the stars

254
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,895
and built the great city oF R'lyeh.

255
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,765
It was the time
oF the dinosaurs.

256
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,386
Cthulhu was going to rule this world,

257
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,083
but the earth had already
been colonized by the Shoggoths

258
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:04,028
and their masters are race oF
aliens Known as the Elder Things.

259
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,497
Cthulhu was pissed.

260
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,741
A great war was Fought
between the two alien races.

261
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,044
The Elder Things send in wave
aFter wave oF their shoggoth hordes.

262
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,480
It was a long and bloody war

263
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,856
until a giant meteorite,
or whatever Killed the dinosaurs

264
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,555
came hurdling towards the earth

265
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,724
sending Cthulhu bacK
to his tomb beneath the sea

266
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,206
and sent the Elder Things
Fleeing into the last great utopia

267
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,266
among the Mountains oF Madness.

268
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,278
The meteor crushed into the earth

269
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,780
[makes crashing noises]

270
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,078
causing the great ice age.

271
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,889
Cthulhu waited For the stars to align
as the earth gave way to civilization.

272
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,657
He sent Forth his minions

273
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,787
Ied by his general Star-spawn

274
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,959
who inFluenced manKind
using telepathy.

275
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,231
[making telepathy noises]

276
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,538
And thus,
the cult oF Cthulhu was born.

277
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,906
The cult spread
to all areas oF the world,

278
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,743
China, Japan,

279
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,047
England, France,

280
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,643
parts oF KentucKy,

281
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,281
a small piece oF land in Ireland
Known as Worchester.

282
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,553
They bayou.

283
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,551
And From the darKest corners oF the
earth, cult worshipped their master,

284
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,895
waiting For the day
the stars would again align,

285
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,960
and they could release Cthulhu
From his tomb beneath the sea

286
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,599
to once again rule
in his dominion over man.

287
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,517
[making roaring noises]

288
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,717
It's pretty much we're
talking about...Cthulhu.

289
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,559
In part, but it fails
to mention the relic,

290
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:27,265
an ancient key made into parts,
split and lost centuries ago.

291
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,571
If this relic comes together
when the great city of R'lyeh rises,

292
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,203
it forms the key to Cthulhu's tomb.

293
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,803
The stars are aligning.

294
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,439
The cult has found
the other piece.

295
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,177
Now, you must keep this safe

296
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,550
until the city sinks beneath
the waves once more.

297
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,959
This was fashioned by
the Old Ones

298
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,361
using craft and skill
lost long ago.

299
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,800
It cannot be destroyed by
man or any known force.

300
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,325
Right.

301
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,928
Can I hold it?

302
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:02,974
[thud]

303
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,407
- What'd I do?
- What the fuck was that?

304
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,070
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

305
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,843
Come on.
You've got to be shittin' me.

306
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,908
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

307
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:14,848
Whoa!

308
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,549
If they found us,
the council is already dead.

309
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,147
Get behind me!

310
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,562
[pounding on door]

311
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,036
Run. P.rotect the relic,

312
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,377
the fate of the world
rest with you now.

313
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,966
So, you are the one?

314
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,493
I am.

315
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,700
[growling]

316
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,635
I'll drive! I'll drive!

317
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,673
This is fucking crazy, man.

318
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,012
There's no such thing
as fish people, dude!

319
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,745
Ah!

320
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,377
- Start the car, okay!
- I don't have the keys!

321
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,853
You have the keys!

322
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,546
It's like a volcano with teeth!

323
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,025
- Get it off the window!
- I'm trying to.

324
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,857
It won't come off.

325
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,260
Get him off!
Get him off!

326
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,287
[together] Ah!

327
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,073
Where the fuck is reverse
in this thing?

328
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,805
Into the front.

329
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,107
Got it!

330
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,555
You've got a lot of fight
in you, old man.

331
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,997
It's not too late to
serve your true god.

332
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,864
I know my path,

333
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,495
and it doesn't lead to
rotting at the bottom of the sea

334
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,562
with you and your masters.

335
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,597
[roaring]

336
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,020
[growling]

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,020
I don't understand this
crazy comic book Cthulhu bullshit!

338
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,088
Okay. Look, man, when I was reading,
it was just a comic book.

339
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,963
There weren't monsters
hitting mywindow.

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,661
So what the fuck
are we going to do?

341
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,928
What the fuck
are we going to do?

342
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,369
I don't know.
I think he was pretty clear,

343
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,770
you're supposed to
save the world and shit.

344
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,329
Oh, really?

345
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,466
I look like a fucking hobbit
to you, bro?

346
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,771
- Afucking hobbit.
- Okay, okay, okay.

347
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,142
Let me think. Let me think.
Let me think, all right. Okay.

348
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,404
Oh, shit, man!
P.aul Reemer, man!

349
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,541
That kid from high school.

350
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,880
You remember,
you broke both of his arms.

351
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:00,782
Yeah, so?

352
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,878
All right, right, well,
that kid ate Lovecraft, bro.

353
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,650
If we can find him,
he can probably help us.

354
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,180
- How the hell are we
going to find him?
- I don't know.

355
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,784
A guy like that probably still lives
with his grandparents, right?

356
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,761
We're going to go.
We're just going to go
find him somewhere.

357
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,923
Find P.aul Reemer out of thin air.

358
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,898
Here we come, P.aul.
Are you ready?

359
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,195
Here we come.

360
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,470
All right, knock.

361
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,774
You knock.

362
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,247
No, you're the one who
mentioned coming over here.

363
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,647
Just fucking knock on the door.

364
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,548
Hey, man, you're
the chosen one, okay.

365
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,109
I can only show you the door.
I can't open it--

366
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,644
I'm not the chosen one,
just knock on the fucking door.

367
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,816
Come on, man, just knock.

368
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,553
You are pathetic.

369
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,763
This isn't right.

370
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,275
Well, it's our only plan.

371
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,334
Did you see him?
Look what he's wearing!

372
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,572
A fucking fish head on his...

373
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,704
What do you want me
to do about it, man?

374
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,237
I don't dress the kid.

375
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,078
So what if he's still looks retarded...

376
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,783
Hey, P.aul, I don't know if
you remember me, Charlie.

377
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,450
We had science class together.

378
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,655
This is Jeff. He used to punch you
in the back of the head.

379
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,830
Remember the...

380
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:26,333
Anyway, I just want to come by
and say I'm sorry about that, so...

381
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,429
Yeah.

382
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:31,909
Well, I appreciate that,
bone breaker.

383
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,503
So, what can I do
for you, Charlie?

384
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,037
Ah, yeah. We wanted you
to look at something

385
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,550
if we can just have a minute
of your time, that would be...

386
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,449
Let's see it.

387
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,887
If we can just come inside,
it's kind of important, so.

388
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,448
It has to do with Cthulhu, dude.

389
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,857
- Really?
- Yeah.

390
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,362
Well, entre vous.

391
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,229
Go on...

392
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,102
P.retty crazy running into
you, guys, like this.

393
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,972
I don't have to keep up with
the whole "alumni situation."

394
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,601
I don't know if you remember

395
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,442
back in high school,
I used to be a bit of a lone wolf.

396
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,004
It's just how I roll.

397
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,140
Oh, would you look at this?

398
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,345
Looks like there's no
peanut butter.

399
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,854
Boy, it'd sure be great
if I can make a sandwich.

400
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,585
My own grandmother wasn't
such a peanut butter whore!

401
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,460
I'm sorry, Nana.

402
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,894
Ah, I'll make one later.

403
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,956
Let's go to my room.

404
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:28,988
Fuck you.

405
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,729
Love you.

406
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,700
[water bubbling]

407
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,874
Bullshit.

408
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,675
We have the relic to prove it.

409
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,012
Oh, really?

410
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,416
Is it like mine?

411
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,749
Where the hell did you
get this thing from, man?

412
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,950
What, you think you're the only
one with the Mastercraft replica?

413
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,288
They make it from
H.P.. Lovecraft draw,ings or something.

414
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,020
I don't know.

415
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,324
I have one of their light swords
around here somewhere.

416
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,920
These things that
tried to attack us.

417
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,864
They weren't after just
some kind of a toy, man.

418
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,231
Look, I don't like you guys'
tone of voice.

419
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,760
You're the two guys who came
to the master's house for help.

420
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,332
Right, right. What, the master
of your grandma's guest room?

421
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,343
Okay.
Let me see yours.

422
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,352
- Huh.
- What?

423
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,717
It's a fake.

424
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,416
It's a phony.
It's not like mine, though.

425
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,685
It's like bootleg.

426
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,057
It's not like yours
because it's real.

427
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:33,258
This is a boot-leg.

428
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,562
I'm so fucking sick of
thiswhole Cthulhu bullshit.

429
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,465
It's all fake, anyway.

430
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,637
[ominous music]

431
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,516
Guys, I think something
is going on.

432
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,319
Do you have like an LED relic?

433
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,724
Because, this is doing
some weird stuff.

434
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,251
They found us in our apartment.

435
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,264
They're going to find us
here for sure.

436
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,925
Okay.
Tell me about the big guy again.

437
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,493
He was tall, reddish.

438
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,904
He had like this weird handle bar,
tentacle mustache thing.

439
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,135
He still looked like
a man, though.

440
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,540
Yeah.
That's the Star-spaw,n.

441
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,671
That's like one of Cthulhu's
main generals.

442
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,511
Okay.
You're going to help us.

443
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,483
- No.
- Yeah. You are, P.aul.

444
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,683
Well, I'm not ready to roll the
nine-sided dice just yet

445
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,350
on this one, boys.

446
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,986
I think we need to find someone
who's got a little firsthand
knowledge of the situation.

447
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:37,494
That's great.

448
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,360
So, what's you're saying is
you're a waste of our time?

449
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,457
No. What I'm saying is Captain Olaf.

450
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,826
It's sea captain.

451
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,600
Look, Captain Olaf had a run in
with the Deep One a few years ago,

452
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,040
and he survived.
That's like a big thing.

453
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,204
The Deep Ones are like
Star-spaw,n's soldiers.

454
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,736
Like...they're bad news, right.

455
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,749
If there's anybody
who can help us,

456
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,248
Olaf can, all right.

457
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,516
Look, look, here it is.

458
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,751
Here's a map to his place
I got a few years ago.

459
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,816
That's less than a
day's drive aw,ay.

460
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,351
It's like the best buck 25
I've ever spent.

461
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,522
That's great.

462
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,260
So, what your saying is
your plan which suck balls,

463
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,768
is to go off some
buck 25 souvenir map

464
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,737
and go find some sea captain
in the fucking desert?

465
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,603
Okay, it's settled then.
Give us the map.

466
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,369
No, no, no, no.

467
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,876
I've been waiting for a long time for
something like this to come around.

468
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,538
I'm in this to win this
as a team.

469
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,571
So, you're the master,
what do we do?

470
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:36,044
I am Cthulhu. Ah...

471
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,250
I come from space and beyond
down to the ocean depths.

472
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,848
Rarr...Ah...

473
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,519
Come on. We don't have time
for this shit, man.

474
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,221
It's called being prepared, Jeff.

475
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,196
What do you care?
You're the chosen one,

476
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,098
which is weird 'cause Lovecraft
didn't even have any heirs.

477
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,227
Oh, you guys
must have been secrets.

478
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,396
Oh, ow.

479
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,030
So why would he
give me this relic?

480
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,701
I mean, even if I am related to
this Lovecraft guy or whatever,

481
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,505
what can I possibly do?

482
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,811
Time out.

483
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,813
Okay.
I have a theory.

484
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,748
Look, Lovecraft went through all
these things with all these creatures,

485
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,513
stuff that would have driven
other men mad.

486
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,951
But he didn't go mad, right?

487
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,854
He must have some kind of
genetic predisposition

488
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,687
to not be affected,
an immunity.

489
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,625
And if he had that,
what's to say hypothetically

490
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,359
that can go down the bloodline
to someone like you, his heir.

491
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,060
Ow! Awesome.

492
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,500
Star-spaw,n, behind you!

493
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,798
Deep One in your butt!

494
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,771
Oh, so here's what I'm supposed to do.

495
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:33,108
"Defeat the Star-spaw,n and
send R'lyeh back to the abyss."

496
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,669
"Good luck, adventurers."

497
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,147
Hey, P.aul.

498
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,582
Tell your ugly grandma
to stop calling people faggots

499
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,950
'cause that shit's not P.C--
What the fuck is on your face?

500
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:43,919
Hey, Clarence.

501
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,389
Hey, you remember my best
friends from high school, right,
Charlie and Jeff.

502
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:50,190
Either your grandma just slipped me
acid in the breast milk she's
always offering people,

503
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,628
or you're wearing a
fucking Cthulhu mask.

504
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,859
The one you promised
not to open without me.

505
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,129
Yeah. It totally is. But hey,

506
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,193
It's cool, though, because
there is an emergency going on.

507
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,761
It's like a level one emergency.

508
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,864
Fucking bullshit, man.

509
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:07,469
Why don't I just take this 1985
blaster set that I just got on eBay

510
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,604
for us

511
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,238
and fucking playwith myself.

512
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,749
[toy gun blasting]

513
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,308
I get it. You're mad
but shouldn't be, all right.

514
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,410
Just calm down.

515
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,114
It's like a fucking nerd black hole.

516
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,144
You want me to calm down.

517
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,713
Why don't you fucking calm down

518
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,454
after I fuck up
your little outfit, huh?

519
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,222
You wouldn't dare.

520
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,319
- Oh, wouldn't I dare?
- No.

521
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,091
Then why is my hand
moving slowly towards your face.

522
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,257
I don't know
but you're not daring.

523
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,993
You don't think
I have the balls to do this!

524
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,466
Not even one ball.

525
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,026
Raped your fucking mask.

526
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,297
Bitch.

527
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,702
-Ah...
- No, no, no, no!

528
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,801
What are you doing?

529
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:40,773
What are you doing?

530
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,303
I got six bucks on
laser beam boy.

531
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,474
I'll take it.

532
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,278
Ah! There it was.

533
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,943
Do you think
you should break it up?

534
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,976
Eh, I'm kind of enjoying it
to be honest with you.

535
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,614
Ah! [all yelling]

536
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,055
Break it up.

537
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,486
All right.

538
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,961
You guys can go to my basement

539
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,328
and then find
whateveryou need for the trip.

540
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,489
[adventurous music]

541
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,463
Ah, Nana,
I'm leaving now.

542
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,337
I'm going on an adventure
with my friends

543
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,739
and it's an adventure
full of glory and danger,

544
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,779
so I might not make it back.

545
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,216
P.Iease don't say what you always
say when my friends come over

546
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,719
that I'm fat and retarded.

547
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,914
But that's how you look.

548
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,513
Come on!

549
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,615
I love you.

550
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,658
I'll never be your
dungeon master again.

551
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,738
What?
They're fish people.

552
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,365
I hate you.

553
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,439
All right.

554
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,313
Sorry.

555
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,511
I would have been a little bit
quicker if somebody wasn't so old!

556
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,813
FucK you.

557
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,213
Hey, sweet mask.

558
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,883
Let's roll.

559
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,989
[pop music]

560
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,412
[creature growling]

561
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,913
[screaming]

562
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,819
[distant thud]

563
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,791
No!
Oh my god!

564
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,030
[creature growling]

565
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,445

[screaming]

568
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,248
A praying mantis would
destroy a salamander.

569
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,585
No, no.

570
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,022
You sound like an idiot, Charlie.

571
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,685
Do you know how fast
a salamander is?

572
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,626
Hey, a salamander
has no defenses, man.

573
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,391
A praying mantis has
its little hook claw,s.

574
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,989
Somebody's never
been into a zoo.

575
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,897
Seriously, salamanders,

576
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,334
praying mantis,
what if dolphins were robots?

577
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,769
- What if dolphins were robots?
- Yeah.

578
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,103
They're not,
so shut the fuck up!

579
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,004
What do you want to do, man?

580
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,407
Do you want to go back and sit
and work in your cubicle all day?

581
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,411
The Jeff P.hillips I know,

582
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,141
the one who defended that
tree fort when we were kids?

583
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,876
Okay.
He'd do something about this.

584
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,042
He'd make a difference.

585
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,244
He's right, Jeff.

586
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,118
You shut your mouth,
you, little grandma's boy.

587
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,315
I'm sorry.
Are we still a team?

588
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,518
Yeah, man. Are we still
a team, Jeff P.hillips?

589
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,686
If you say Jeff P.hillips
one more time,

590
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,662
I'll fucking turn you
into bone dust.

591
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,757
Hey, this might be some
pretty bad timing,

592
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,735
but I just wanted to thank you
guys for bringing me along.

593
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,032
[together] Shut up!

594
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,274
We're still a team, Charlie.

595
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,476
Really?
That's aw,esome, bro.

596
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,280
Gentle giant.

597
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,287
[machines powering up]

598
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,200
How charming. A half-breed.

599
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,188
[creatures growling]

600
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:42,103
These Deep Ones have travelled
so far, my children,

601
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,172
and it is they you shall be serving.

602
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:49,050
You'll see,
they are still so hungry.

603
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,035
All right.
You stay here with the relic.

604
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,164
I'm going to see if
they have a vending machine.

605
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,572
- Hey, can you see if
they have cream cakes?
- Yeah.

606
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,644
Good evening.

607
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,111
It's a nice boar you got there.

608
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,053
Yeah.
I found it on the road.

609
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,485
You need a room?

610
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,552
No. I was wondering if you had
a vending machine around here.

611
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,826
Does this look like a
fucking Quick Mart to you?

612
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,423
No.
I was just asking...

613
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,027
[laughing]

614
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,662
I was just kidding.

615
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,537
You should've seen your face.

616
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:27,682
Hey, Charlie,
um...I was just thinking.

617
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:31,017
I made this bracelet
when I was in the third grade,

618
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,046
and I never gave it to anybody.

619
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,490
I didn't have anybody
to give it to.

620
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,120
I think I just held
onto it for good luck.

621
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,322
Yeah.

622
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,923
So, do you have a
vending machine at all?

623
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,129
There's a snack rack
right there in the corner.

624
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,160
Bend on over
and see what we got.

625
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,263
All right.

626
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,837
I was just thinking
if anything would happen

627
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:57,371
I want you to have it, please.

628
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,110
Hey, you know what, man,

629
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,452
I'm a little flattered
but I don't swing that way, so.

630
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,616
No, no, no.
This is a friendship bracelet.

631
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,890
- Whoa! Hey!
- Hey.

632
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,729
About what I said back there,

633
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,428
I didn't mean nothin' by it

634
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,835
so if you want to have
sex with me or whatever.

635
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,338
No, man.

636
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,466
I'm cool, bro.

637
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,136
-Well?
-Well, well what?

638
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,510
Do you need any magazines?

639
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,571
No.

640
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,344
You know, I don't really
want the chips anymore.

641
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,873
I'm just going to take off.

642
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,748
Excuse me there.

643
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,583
Hey, this is my sex face.

644
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,791
Yeah, yeah. Hey, whatever
you want to call it.

645
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,887
- It's what I'm calling it--
- Shh. Hey.

646
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,626
- It's for friendship.
- Hey, nobody is judging, okay.

647
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,260
It's...we're all good, bro.

648
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,335
Be careful out there.

649
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,862
There are some weird folk
out here in the desert.

650
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,430
I know.

651
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,408
Start the car.

652
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,840
Start the car.

653
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,806
It's already started, man.

654
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,976
There are some
weird people here.

655
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,280
P.aul's gay.

656
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,488
[mysterious music]

657
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,344
Hey, Charlie, do you still make
comic books like you did back
in high school?

658
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,108
Yeah, yeah, man.

659
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,015
Actually, I got a couple of pages
right now that are pretty sweet.

660
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,848
No way, really?
What are they about?

661
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,845
Well, now, you see all these
like Japanese fish and ponds
and stuff in malls,

662
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,687
Okay, right,
well they get fed up, right,

663
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,853
so they like reach back into their
heritage and they make all these

664
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,886
ancient, you know,
weapons and armors.

665
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,363
So, I mean, they become

666
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,366
[together] samurai fish.

667
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,269
Right, right.

668
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:02,898
And then they just...they come
out and they fucking just...they
slaughter people.

669
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,206
- It's like revenge, you know.
- That is so good.

670
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,577
Yeah. Well, I mean,
you know it's kind of stalled.

671
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:15,449
The fish have fins so they can't
really do any proper blacksmithing.

672
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,851
I mean, it's a brilliant idea.

673
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:17,945
It's so good.

674
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:22,084
And who is to say that the
samurai fish can't come in to contact

675
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,027
with like a league of gorillas
with opposablethumbs

676
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:29,590
and they can make the armor
and the weapons?

677
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,295
It's not out of the realm
of realistic-ness.

678
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,860
I love that.

679
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,532
It's like a monkey-fish army.

680
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,235
You like it?

681
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,435
You can use it.

682
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,911
Guys, we're really are
meant for each, I think.

683
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,847
What's wrong with that, Jeff?

684
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,544
Did you watch this show when
you were a kid too, man?

685
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,884
[together] Goblins in forest,
goblin magic!

686
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,857
- Yeah, I love that, man.
- I didn't watch it.

687
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,928
All right, home slices.

688
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,125
Lets get in the damn car
and get some sleep.

689
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,564
Hoo-rah?

690
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,536
Hey, P.aul, can we use your
cellphone to set the alarm?

691
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,765
I left ours at home.

692
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,774
I don't have a cellphone.

693
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,571
Are you serious?

694
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,510
Who would I call?

695
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,778
Hey, all right,
don't even worry about it, okay.

696
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,612
I like a human alarm clock.

697
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,550
Sincewhen, dude?

698
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,984
I've got it covered.

699
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,988
All right, just...
Nighty-night.

700
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,957
Nighty-night, man.

701
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:42,930
Ah!

702
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,031
Good morning!

703
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,439
What the hell are you doing,
you freak?

704
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,501
Did you reallythink
we wouldn't find you?

705
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,241
- We're everywhere.
- What? Big, greasy rhinos.

706
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,577
He's one of the cult of Cthulhu.

707
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,245
Step out of the car
and hand over the relic.

708
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,482
- Start the car, man.
- The big boss is on his way,

709
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,921
and I'm the one
giving him the relic.

710
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,685
It won't start, dude.

711
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,522
Step out of the car and I won't
have to kill you right aw,ay.

712
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,756
What are you talking about, bitch?
There's like three of us.

713
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,991
- We'll take you out.
- P.Iease, P.aul.

714
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,727
It doesn't work for you.

715
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,897
Hey, what's he doing?

716
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,005
I'm pretty sure the relic is
fire proof, you little pop tarts.

717
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,012
Well, I guess, we'll find out.

718
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,948
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

719
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,008
You win. You win.
We're coming out.

720
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,577
That's what I'm talking about,
ass-kicking time, right guys?

721
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,986
Shut the fuck up, P.aul.

722
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,182
Just listen.

723
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,920
When we get out of the car,
you wait for my signal and we run.

724
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,517
Run?

725
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,027
Where to? We're in the
middle of a fucking desert.

726
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,927
We don't have choice,
dowe, dude?

727
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,761
Now bring that bag.

728
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,959
We're getting out.

729
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,399
Just calm down.

730
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,705
It's all good.

731
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,775
That's it, boys,

732
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,405
and keep playing ball and maybe
I won't have to playwith yours.

733
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,574
Wait, what?
Our balls?

734
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,083
You got balls, don't you?

735
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,608
Yeah. I guess,
I just don't get the reference.

736
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,211
You were in there, dude.
He'll fuck with your balls, bro.

737
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:04,949
Trust me.

738
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,354
Is that why you were
running to the car, man?

739
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,721
Did you got your balls
fucked with?

740
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,725
Just get ready to run.

741
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,158
I wouldn't run
if I was you,

742
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,253
seeing as we have you surrounded.

743
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,062
All right, look. Easy, easy.

744
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,727
What are we going to do?

745
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:18,598
All right.

746
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,228
There's that bag from P.aul's house,

747
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,637
when I start to approach him,
you throw me a weapon, all right.

748
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,230
No, no, no.

749
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,969
That's like the worst plan
I've ever heard.

750
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,034
We don't have any
other choice, all right.

751
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,374
Now, let's just do it.

752
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,242
All right.

753
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,215
I got the relic, I'm going to
bring it overto you, all right.

754
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,716
I got it right here.

755
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,245
Now!

756
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,418
Why?

757
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,755
I was on top.

758
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,739
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey look, everybody.

759
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,339
I got the relic.

760
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,583
P.aul, what the fuck
are you doing?

761
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,212
I'm saving you!

762
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,380
Go.

763
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,158
Oh, god.

764
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,931
Do you guys exercise
or something?

765
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,269
Like...doyou do cardio?

766
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,765
Hand over the relic.

767
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,607
Here, geez.

768
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,976
[laughing]

769
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,845
Wait, hold on...

770
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,312
Man.

771
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,484
If that map is right, this place
should be around here somewhere.

772
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,687
Hey, man.
Do you think P.aul is okay?

773
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,958
Oh, who knows, man?
It's your fault anyway.

774
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,964
A fucking snorkel mask!

775
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,829
Hey, you know, I'm not good
under pressure, all right.

776
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,529
A fucking snorkel mask, bro!

777
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,073
Hey,

778
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,112
that's an RV, right.

779
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,085
This place is a rat hole, man.

780
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,687
All right, knock.

781
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,925
You knock.

782
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,489
No, man. I did all knocking
at P.aul's house.

783
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,434
Hey, we already established this,
okay, you're the chosen one.

784
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,198
- I show you the door.
- You're such a pussy, man.

785
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,795
[knocking on door]

786
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,066
[ringing bell]

787
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,503
Ain't nothing to see here, boys.

788
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,345
Just move along now.

789
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,875
Oh, we are looking for a man
that might live around here.

790
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,753
Like I said, ain't nothing here.

791
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,984
No Captain Olaf for you.

792
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,686
Uh...

793
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,821
We never said anything
about a Captain Olaf.

794
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,694
Would you be Captain Olaf?

795
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,729
Cripes, I keep doing that.

796
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,464
I'm Captain Olaf,
'tis true.

797
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,734
You got me there, but

798
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,833
I cannot help you fight the monsters.
You seek to slay.

799
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,310
I don't know nothing about
fighting no sea monsters.

800
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,438
Okay, bro.

801
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,039
We could go right back
into the desert.

802
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,176
No, no.
Look, we came this far.

803
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,584
We can do this.

804
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,551
Captain Olaf, open up.
We need your help.

805
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,526
We have the relic, the one
that opens Cthulhu's tomb.

806
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:16,665
You shouldn't speak so lightly of
things you know nothing about.

807
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,867
Real or not,

808
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,705
that's not something you want
to just be flashing about

809
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,711
Iike the ass end of a sea donkey.

810
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,110
Sea donkey?

811
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,774
Stop your yammerin'.

812
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,010
Get your asses in here before you
bring down the minions of hell.

813
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,176
- All right, all right. We apolo--
- I shouldn't have...

814
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,583
Okay, okay, we're coming in.

815
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,520
All right, hold it.

816
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,079
Let me tidy up.

817
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,850
[seafaring music]

818
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,889
Go ahead.
Have a seat.

819
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,241
That's a nice crab.

820
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,611
Sure, until you
find it in your pants.

821
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,013
Yeah.

822
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,683
Now, let's hear your fish story.

823
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,659
[flies buzzing]

824
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,201
Oh, come on.

825
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,508
Ew.

826
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,481
[suspenseful music]

827
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,743
What is this?

828
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,746
I'm like a ninja eagle.

829
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,753
Ah!

830
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,854
[roaring]

831
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,689
Fools.

832
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,431
[roaring]

833
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,038
And that's why we're here.

834
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,666
We're hoping you can help us.

835
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,613
You boys have ever been
fish-raped?

836
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:45,412
It's something you're
not likely to forget.

837
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,049
We were out night fishing.

838
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,492
It was one of them
real cold nights,

839
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,792
kind of cold that makes a man's
balls want to hibernating

840
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,663
Iike a pair of weasels
up inside his chest.

841
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:04,229
A creepin' fog coming out of space,

842
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,335
slipping overthe deep water.

843
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:12,439
We never even heard
those things come aboard.

844
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:16,714
It killed my crew
within minutes.

845
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:21,281
The sound of their screams
still haunt mywaking hours.

846
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,623
I close my eyes,

847
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:29,121
I see the horror of a thousand
deaths play across the blackness.

848
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,691
Those teeth,

849
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,760
those cold insidious eyes

850
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,705
that hell sent to
drive a man to madness,

851
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,709
Deep Ones, as legend calls them

852
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:44,476
have hankerin' to
mate with us, normal folk,

853
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:49,975
forthose scaled, webbed
hands might tickle a bit.

854
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,921
I dare to even call them soothing.

855
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,322
Then bang!
You're an anchovy popsicle.

856
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,122
If you catch my meaning.

857
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,387
Now, you boys start down this road,

858
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,922
that's all that's waiting for you,

859
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:07,027
awhole heapin' of fish-rapin'.

860
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,538
So why don't you do what I did.

861
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,065
Move as far aw,ay
from the water as you can

862
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,702
and never look back.

863
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,041
[water splashing]

864
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,780
Don't worry.
That's just Gary.

865
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,981
Is somebody back there?

866
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,355
Come on back.
I'll introduce you.

867
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,858
What the hell is that thing?

868
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:43,430
Do you remember how I told you how
Deep Ones like to mate with normal folks?

869
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:47,307
Well, Gary here is the unfortunate
offspring of one such encounter.

870
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,211
You see, being that one of his
parents is a Deep One,

871
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,876
he started changing as
the ocean called him back.

872
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,683
His human side
just keeps fighting to hang on.

873
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,087
I've been takin' care of him
about six months now.

874
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,385
Good kid.

875
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,089
Here you go.

876
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,064
First, I thought I might be able to
make a little money of the fellow.

877
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,868
You know, maybe start a little
freak show or whatever.

878
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,171
Yeah, right, a freak show.
That makes sense.

879
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,677
Well, that didn't quite pan out.

880
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:28,116
It seems you need a license
for him...or it...or something.

881
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:31,120
I was just going to
bury him out in the desert.

882
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,884
But then I realized
I've grown fond of the little fellow.

883
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,586
Isn't that right, Gary.

884
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:40,187
You know, now, that I think about
it and you've seen him up close,

885
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,596
you probably owe me
a couple of bucks.

886
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,631
[distant thud]

887
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,933
You boys, expecting someone?

888
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,200
[together] No.

889
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,815
There's something out there,

890
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,717
and he's got a wild eye
the size of a sperm whale.

891
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,811
God, it's P.aul.

892
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,153
- Wait!
- P.aul.

893
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,614
P.aul.

894
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:28,075
Damn you,
you fish worshipping freaks!

895
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,341
Damn you all!

896
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,708
Charlie.

897
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,184
P.aul, buddy.

898
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,449
Hi.

899
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,285
You're alive.

900
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,053
Yeah.
They just broke my arms.

901
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,061
Does it hurt?

902
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,256
They broke both my arms.

903
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,559
Jeff, man, he's alive.

904
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,532
Come on.
They just broke his arms.

905
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,797
All right.
Come on. Get him back.

906
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,367
Ah!

907
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,572
- Ow, my arms!
- Take it easy, take it easy.

908
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,115
Easy, guys.

909
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,781
Oh, man, what happened to him?

910
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,957
Set your bones down here
and rest, what's left of them.

911
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,189
Try something of the
captain's special tonic.

912
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,629
Good for what ails ya.

913
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,163
Is that Captain Olaf?

914
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,229
Is he cool?

915
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,830
Yeah, man.
Hey, what happened?

916
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:35,573
Oh, while I was running aw,ay
from the cult members,

917
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:36,943
saving you, remember?

918
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,177
Yeah, and I said I'm going to
stop and fight and so I did,

919
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,548
and I started taking them down.

920
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,715
And then Star-spaw,n came,
and he's like, "Ah, I'm red. Ah"

921
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:50,454
So, I started kicking him and then he
turned into a giant octopus and stuff.

922
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,257
And so basically,
I was the hero.

923
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,127
Star-spaw,n, huh?

924
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,599
Out here in the desert,
they can be hurt.

925
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,033
They can't be out
of the ocean indefinitely

926
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,401
without getting back
to some sort of water.

927
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:02,928
Isn't that right, Gary?

928
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,702
What... Who's Gary?

929
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,208
Forget it.

930
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,610
Look, I say we make stand.

931
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,046
- What?
- Yeah, what?

932
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,846
If that relic is reassembled,
all hell is going to break loose,

933
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:15,942
and then what?

934
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,716
Are we just going
to run forever?

935
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,779
Look.

936
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,188
They already killed
the professor.

937
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,421
They broke both P.aul's arms,
they violated the captain.

938
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:28,329
So, how long are we going to end up
running until we stand up and fight?

939
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,390
Look, man, I'm sorry,
but I say we keep running, okay.

940
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,367
What chance do we have
against those things, Jeff?

941
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,734
Come on, Charlie.

942
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,002
What about all the stuff you said
about saving the world?

943
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,202
What do you say, Cap?

944
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,972
Are you gonna help us?

945
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,207
I'm sorry, boys.

946
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:48,581
I've been living out here this long,
and now this is where I'll die.

947
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,019
My love for life ended when
they took the ocean from me.

948
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,080
Mywill to fight is long gone.

949
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,184
Hey, I don't want to interrupt
but just FYl,

950
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:01,220
I'm pretty sure those guys saw,
the map that leads to here

951
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:05,132
so whatever we're going to decide
we should decide it.

952
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,762
I do have a weapon stash
not far from here.

953
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,796
We can give them a real fight.

954
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,831
Okay, okay, okay, look. Okay.

955
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,173
I'm going to stay here with P.aul.

956
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,110
You get the stash
and you get back.

957
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:23,245
Jeff and I will be back faster than
whale shit through an ice flow.

958
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,951
Hey, be careful.
You get back here, okay.

959
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,293
You know I will, man.

960
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,532
You guys got like a
hidden handshake or something...

961
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,660
Ow, ow, ow.

962
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,396
Oh, that's spicy.

963
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,880
Are you hungry too, Gary?

964
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,862
Looks like peanut action, huh.

965
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,161
All right.

966
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,599
Here you go, little buddy.

967
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,334
Sour cream and onion.

968
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,001
Bingo.

969
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,907
Lets see here.

970
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,468
Okay.

971
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,542
Oh, God.

972
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,216
Oh, shit.

973
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,978
Water, water.
We've got to get you to water.

974
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,683
God.

975
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,954
Okay, hang in there.

976
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,655
Okay, hang on, that's my back.

977
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,129
Just breath.

978
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,099
Ah!

979
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,840
Oh, god, Gary.

980
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,041
Oh...Oh, god.

981
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,443
What are we looking for?

982
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:08,514
We're looking for an old sea chest
I left in this branch of the cave.

983
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,292
Ah, hold on, Gary.

984
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,093
I'll get you to the water.

985
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,696
Okay, here we go.

986
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,260
Okay, now.

987
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,328
Okay.

988
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,363
Okay, Oh, all right.

989
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,999
Let's get you in there.

990
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,805
Okay. All right.

991
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,512
There you go, huh.

992
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,312
Got your little tub, huh.

993
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,614
There we go.
There, there we go.

994
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,419
He's breathin' now, buddy.
Look at that.

995
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,986
Oh, the sour cream
and onion back there.

996
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,741
There she be.

997
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,996
Let's bring the dynamite too.

998
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,338
I like the cut of your jib.

999
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,650
Oh, god.

1000
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,122
Gary!

1001
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,760
He's dead.

1002
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,026
What the hell did you do?

1003
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,034
Hey, man, I couldn't even take care of
my goldfish when I was a kid,

1004
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,035
and you leave me with this.

1005
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,832
That is not a goldfish.

1006
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,133
You just killed Gary, man.

1007
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,834
I tried to save Gary
that's why he's in the sink.

1008
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,742
He did try, kind of.

1009
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,746
Did you put salt in the water?

1010
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,148
Unbelievable.

1011
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:16,174
I'm really sorry, Jeff.
I've never babysat a mer-guy before.

1012
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,880
It's common sense, Charlie.

1013
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:23,188
Okay, Jeff, there's nothing common
sense about a mer-guy named Gary
living in an RV.

1014
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,285
You did something
I could never do,

1015
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,126
kill an innocent sea creature.

1016
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,564
Fine.

1017
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,660
I suppose you put him out of his
misery in some perverse way.

1018
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,534
Right, huh, you see that, Jeff.

1019
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,803
Looks like Gary had a guardian
angel and his name is Charlie.

1020
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,399
Right.

1021
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:46,211
Everytime a fog horn blows another
twisted mer-being gets his fins.

1022
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,149
Exactly.

1023
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:51,711
A moment of silence
for our fallen comrade.

1024
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,051
Bow your head.

1025
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:02,030
I once had a fish
pee on me for hours.

1026
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,657
I loved it.

1027
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,636
Well, all right then.

1028
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,467
[distant roaring]

1029
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,082
[roaring]

1030
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:26,950
We got company.

1031
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,287
Olaf, can you start the RV?

1032
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,791
Do you happen to have
an engine on you?

1033
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,727
Oh, we're going to die.
Aren't we?

1034
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,059
Ah...bullets?

1035
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,964
I keep them just outside...
near the trash heap.

1036
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,627
Why would you keep your
bullets in the trash heap?

1037
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,636
It's a safety issue.

1038
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,605
For aw,hile when
Gary was changing,

1039
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,938
I wanted to shoot myself.

1040
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,274
Figured it was better not to have
them lying around inside the RV.

1041
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,038
We're setting ducks
out there, man.

1042
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,743
They'll tear us apart even
before we got to that trash heap.

1043
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,617
Oh, right. That somebody decided
to keep their bullets in.

1044
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,122
Oh, we need some kind of a bait,

1045
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,680
something to keep their
attention to this side of the RV

1046
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:02,656
while we go forthe ammo.

1047
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,522
That's great, Jeff.

1048
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,049
Okay, but there's no
bait shop around, okay.

1049
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,618
Where are we going to get bait?

1050
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,370
You heartless bastards.

1051
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:20,337
No, no, no, wait.

1052
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,809
Why do we both have to go again?

1053
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,142
Because, I'd rather have two
armed people out there than one.

1054
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,442
- Now let's go.
-Wait...Iook l...

1055
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,642
Look, I could cover you.
I'll be like 'You could do it, Jeff.'

1056
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,914
Yeah, yeah, really,
with one bullet, dude.

1057
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,385
Gary ain't getting any fresher.

1058
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,911
All right.
Here's what we're going to do.

1059
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,923
We're going out there and we're
going to get those bullets, all right.

1060
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,323
Which had better be there.

1061
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,294
I'm going to open it up with that key,

1062
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,454
and you're going to be my look out.

1063
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,690
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, yeah.

1064
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,358
- Do you understand?
- Yeah!

1065
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,304
I got nothing.

1066
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,713
Oh, that's better.

1067
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,881
Yeah, choke on him you bastard.

1068
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,390
Well, what are you waiting for?

1069
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,154
- Come on!
- All right.

1070
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,591
Go, go.

1071
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,768
Gary! Oh, Gary...

1072
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,304
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, man.

1073
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:31,904
Man, I'm serious!
They're almost out of Gary.

1074
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,212
I know! It's locked, dude. Shit!

1075
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,774
We're going to have to
run this thing back.

1076
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,115
Okay? Grab it.

1077
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,643
Ready. Go.

1078
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,882
[roaring]

1079
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,286
Olaf!

1080
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,364
Who's fish-rapin' now?

1081
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,930
If you boys are done lookin'...

1082
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,774
I thought you lost
your love for life.

1083
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,787
Yeah, well,
I couldn't have lived with guilt.

1084
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,516
Forwhat, not helping us?

1085
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,421
'Cause I gave you the wrong key.

1086
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,156
[glass breaking]

1087
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,684
Holy shit!

1088
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:20,753
The key! Get the key!

1089
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,594
Olaf, the key.

1090
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,894
Oh my god.

1091
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,260
Run!

1092
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,248
You got him, man.

1093
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,686
Now get the ammo.
Come on, lets run.

1094
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,186
Hey, what's in the other box?

1095
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,663
Dynamite.

1096
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:56,960
Will it work?

1097
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,489
Maybe, maybe not.

1098
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,626
Okay.

1099
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,405
- Oh, guys, do you think I can get some...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry,

1100
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,837
- There you go. Okay.
- I don't know if this is...

1101
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,812
Guard the RV.

1102
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,042
Okay, let's go.

1103
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,661
[clapping]

1104
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,433
Well done.

1105
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,063
You've managed
to destroy my pets.

1106
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,504
Now, bring me the relic.

1107
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,735
- You can talk.
- Talk?

1108
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,970
We helped create your language.

1109
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,036
- Dude.
- Silence!

1110
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:49,313
Bring me the relic or your death
will be the length of most lifetimes!

1111
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,258
[both screaming]

1112
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,563
So, the bloodline of
Lovecraft lives.

1113
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,928
I guess so.

1114
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:07,800
Then I suppose you will be
able to watch your friends die.

1115
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,035
[both screaming]

1116
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,776
I'm sorry, Charlie!
I didn't mean to do that.

1117
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,403
Do over! Do over!

1118
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,678
[screaming continues]

1119
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,155
[heart beating]

1120
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,491
[together] No!

1121
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,731
[mournful music]

1122
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,968
I can smell the ocean again

1123
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,909
and seagulls.

1124
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,379
I can hear the seagulls.

1125
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:55,043
I freakin' hate seagulls,

1126
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,814
but I feel the mist of the ocean.

1127
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,519
It's okay.

1128
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,047
It's okay now

1129
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:05,492
and we can sail, going home.

1130
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:11,856
It's so beautiful.

1131
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,706
Hey, he's gone.
You've got to let him go.

1132
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,922
Wait.

1133
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,481
Wait.
What happened to the captain?

1134
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:37,457
He's gone.

1135
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,790
He's gone?

1136
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:41,522
Oh, shit.

1137
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,725
Oh, I think I just peed myself.

1138
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,535
[thud]

1139
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,008
Reload, reload.

1140
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,775
That's all my ammunition. You?

1141
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:58,837
- That's the last one.
- Oh, shit.

1142
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,508
- Look, I say we make a run for it.
- Okay.

1143
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,573
At the count of three.

1144
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,676
One, two, three.

1145
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,151
Something is blocking it, man.

1146
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,953
Hey!
There's a thing out there!

1147
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,290
Oh, shit.

1148
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,495
Ah!

1149
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:19,960
What the fuck!

1150
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,431
Fuck! Shoot it!

1151
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,499
I can't get a clear shot, man.

1152
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,170
Shoot it!

1153
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,975
I trust you!
Fucking shoot it!

1154
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,915
[roaring]

1155
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,151
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1156
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,181
- Jeff!
- Charlie!

1157
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,055
- Jeff!
- Charlie!

1158
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,790
Mother fucker!

1159
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,396
What the fuck are we
going to do now?

1160
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,496
We're just got to get
to the roof.

1161
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,665
How?

1162
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,765
I've got a plan.

1163
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,208
Go!

1164
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,837
- Oh, shit!
- Go, go.

1165
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,039
Fuck!

1166
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,984
Oh, fuck!

1167
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,481
[creature roaring]

1168
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,036
We made it up.
Now what?

1169
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,038
That was the plan,
to get to the roof.

1170
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,570
We could have jumped out
the window and then run for it.

1171
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,405
We don't know how fast
those fucking things are, man.

1172
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,172
Okay, okay, so now what?

1173
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,003
I got dynamite, bro.

1174
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,982
Okay, okay, okay, so...

1175
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,574
All right, I'm going to light this.

1176
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,380
I'm going to throw it at that window

1177
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,046
and I'm going to blow
that mother fucker up.

1178
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,554
How long are you
going to make the fuse?

1179
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:47,385
That long.

1180
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,617
Okay, how about like that?

1181
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:49,316
Sounds good.

1182
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,689
Here, light that shit.

1183
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,089
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1184
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:54,596
Okay, okay, okay.

1185
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,495
- Okay, throw it out.
Throw it out.
- Ready?

1186
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,056
Hey, guys.

1187
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,660
P.aul, what the fuck
are you doing in there?

1188
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:04,730
My arms don't work and there's
tentacle things swinging around me

1189
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,241
and dynamite next to my penis.

1190
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,338
I don't like it, I don't like it!

1191
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,774
I don't like it!

1192
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,519
Okay, throw it now! Go!

1193
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,849
Go!

1194
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,059
[all yelling]

1195
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,162
Duck down, it's gonna blow!

1196
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,772
Where's the relic?

1197
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:40,866
Son of a bitch.

1198
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,844
God, I suck at saving the world.

1199
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,371
[creature growling]

1200
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,512
Well, this suck balls.

1201
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,577
I'm glad your little plan
didn't work.

1202
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,885
P.erhaps I will allowyou
to be slaves after all.

1203
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,858
How much ammunition we got left?

1204
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,893
I got nothing.

1205
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,624
I got one left here.

1206
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,342
[thunder cracks]
Behold.

1207
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,743
It's gonna' be all right.

1208
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,215
[screaming]

1209
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,065
[screaming]

1210
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,201
This one's foryou, Olaf.

1211
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,106
We did it, man.

1212
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,972
We saved the world.

1213
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,877
Yeah...we did.

1214
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,153
[adventurous music]

1215
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:56,268
There you go.

1216
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:56,710
Cool, man.

1217
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,542
Thank you, man.
Take care.

1218
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,750
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

1219
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,810
What's going on?
You like the relic of Cthulhu, huh.

1220
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,684
It's okay.

1221
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,986
Hey, come here.

1222
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:12,118
I don't tell this to most people,
but this story,

1223
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,685
it really happened.

1224
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,594
No, it didn't.

1225
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:20,659
No, I mean, I mean, to me and
my friend, it really happened.

1226
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,433
Can you just sign my comic?

1227
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,769
I'm trying at the moment.

1228
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,038
- I'm just trying to share with you tha--
- Just hand my comic, dude.

1229
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:32,907
I got the map.

1230
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,849
The council thinks there are maybe
more important relics there.

1231
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,453
P.aul is waiting with the plane.

1232
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,921
Let's go.

1233
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,224
The fate of the world
rests with you now, kid.

1234
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,693
Good luck.

1235
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,327
[adventurous music]

1236
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,581
[creature roaring]
