00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,592
ROME, SUMMER OF 1966

2
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,595
Can you help me? I have
to take the TV downstairs.

3
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:15,046
I'm studying.

4
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,706
It'll take a minute... Please.

5
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:20,172
No, I'm having an
exam in a few days.

6
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:23,079
Ask Nicola, he's in the
other room with Carlo.

7
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,280
Okay, I'll ask him.

8
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:48,926
"Natalino Sapegno,
History of..." Who's that?

9
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,402
He's my Italian teacher.

10
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,394
- Is he famous?
- You bet he is.

11
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,035
- And is he going to test you?
- No, his assistants will.

12
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,311
Assistants?
Do they know who you are?

13
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,052
Like they care, dad...

14
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,869
The "Messaggero" published
a composition of yours!

15
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,770
This Mr. Sapegno has
to test you personally.

16
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,572
When he sees
how smart you are,

17
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:10,626
maybe he'll help you win some
scholarship, so you can go abroad.

18
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,806
I can come with you
I'll speak to him.

19
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,368
What? You want
to speak to Mr. Sapegno?

20
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:16,744
Of course,
I'm not ashamed!

21
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:17,965
But I am.

22
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,918
Well, I was just trying to help.

23
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,105
When are you leaving to Norway?

24
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,338
After the exams.

25
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,314
I know a few people there.

26
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:35,609
I can give you their addresses, maybe
their daughters are your same age.

27
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,553
Ask them. They're
the experts there.

28
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,162
- Dad?
- The door.. Yes I know.

29
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,660
Okay boys, I have
a mission for you two.

30
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,452
That's great, we needed a break.

31
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:59,070
I'll leave the door open
as we'll be right back.

32
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,763
- Nicola, have you got the keys?
- Yes.

33
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,146
Then I better close it.

34
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,041
One can never know...

35
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,558
Mind the steps!

36
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,514
- Let me open the door.
- Where shall we put it?

37
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,920
Here on the luggage rack.
It would be tossed about otherwise.

38
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,194
- Here?
- Yes. Be careful.

39
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,893
- Careful!
- Okay.

40
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,425
- Go!
- Here!

41
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,305
- Come on!
- Here, wait...

42
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,664
- It needs tying up, right?
- Yes I'll take care of it.

43
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:32,852
- Will you?
- Yes.

44
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,649
- Bye.
- Bye.

45
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,996
Carlo, I wanted to
ask you for something,

46
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:39,364
because if I ask Nicola
he won't reply to me.

47
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,434
- Do you know Matteo well?
- Of course.

48
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,329
Tell me then,
what's wrong with him?

49
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:47,711
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's always angry.

50
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,316
- Come on, let's go study!
- We were talking!

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,020
You're always talking...

52
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,071
Oh, wait a minute, I've
got something for you.

53
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,729
I've had it in
the car for a week.

54
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,856
- Where did you get it?
- I traded for it.

55
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,723
What should I do with it?

56
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,318
You're a student in Medicine,
maybe you'll need it.

57
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,500
How are you, mate?

58
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:00,849
Quite well.

59
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:05,010
But in case of a turning point
in the situation, so to speak,

60
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,185
can I use your holiday home?

61
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:11,191
- The holiday home is a great idea!
- Don't even think about it!

62
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,575
What? That house is perfect!

63
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:14,669
Perfect? Last time you
used it you made such a mess

64
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:15,950
that my mother's still crying!

65
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,949
- Not again please!
- Yes again please. Enough!

66
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:22,130
By the way, I spoke
with my father.

67
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,964
- And?
- And he'll lend us the car!

68
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,669
- Great!
- This is good news!

69
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,000
Did you tell him we're
going to Cape North?

70
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,532
I told him it's an educational
journey around Europe.

71
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,983
So we'll leave
after the exams?

72
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:37,002
Yes, only we can't push
the engine over 4,000 revolutions.

73
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,850
So?

74
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,703
Are you coming to
Carlo's holiday home?

75
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,246
You and I?

76
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,781
- Yes.
- Alone?

77
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,934
Of course.

78
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:59,036
It's beautiful, the sand is golden,
it's full of "Tamarix aphilla",

79
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:02,127
and flying dolphins...
It's beautiful, and I love you.

80
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,965
- You're always kidding Nicola.
- No, I'm serious!

81
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,554
- I love you, I swear.
- Come on, let's dance.

82
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,832
Did you ask your
dad about that job?

83
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,985
You must be at the
clinic on Monday morning.

84
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,143
Do you have the address?

85
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:35,621
<i>It's called "speech therapy"</i>

86
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:39,612
<i>You only have to take
our patient for a walk,</i>

87
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,335
and chat with her to
help her feel "normal".

88
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:45,415
You don't have to
make friends with her,

89
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,393
it's just a therapy.

90
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,041
Giorgia has been
well for a while now,

91
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,366
so we need you only
twice a week. Follow me.

92
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,840
There she is.

93
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,382
You'll see it's easier
than walking a dog.

94
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:07,408
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?

95
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,013
Giorgia, don't speak to
people you don't know.

96
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,064
- What's your name?
- Matteo.

97
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:13,895
Mad Matteo,
madly mad Matteo...

98
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,445
- Watch out!
- Don't touch me!

99
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,048
I won't touch you,
but watch out.

100
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,334
Look left then right.

101
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:20,554
Go.

102
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:23,520
Do you like it here?

103
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:27,597
I come here often.

104
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,751
It soothes my nerves.

105
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,194
And there are no cars...

106
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,055
There's a beautiful place here.

107
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,346
Would you like to see it?

108
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,018
Would you?

109
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,529
When I've had enough of
studying at home I come here.

110
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,888
I like it here.

111
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,485
At this hour it's
almost desert too.

112
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:16,662
Shall we read something?

113
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,912
Yes. Trains.

114
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,395
Trains? Trains what?

115
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,702
What time they
leave or arrive...

116
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,494
Oh, the timetable.

117
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,732
There's no timetable here, sorry.

118
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:38,066
But there's a book I'd like to
read to you, a book of poems.

119
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,716
Wait, where's...

120
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,428
...American literature?

121
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:47,067
<i>It's not easy to cover
the percentage of life..</i>

122
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,259
<i>She deals the cards
to catch you in weakness,</i>

123
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,948
<i>not in full strength.</i>

124
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,164
<i>She gives you
70 years to play.</i>

125
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:56,140
<i>If you can't in 70 years,</i>

126
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,849
<i>you can no more.</i>

127
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,542
Leave the room if you lose.

128
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:04,594
Leave when
your time's over.

129
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:07,773
<i>Only cowards stay
and hang on to the cards.</i>

130
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,219
Hey, look out!
Mind the cars!

131
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,183
Oh my God!

132
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,911
Hey, careful!
What are you doing?

133
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:27,619
- Don't touch me!
- I'm not touching you. Fuck you!

134
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,993
I won't touch you but
you want to be run over!

135
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:33,007
Idiot, cockhead, shitface!

136
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,184
Listen, do you
know what death is?

137
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:36,731
- Asshole!
- No, you're an asshole!

138
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:38,396
- Fuck you!
- No fuck you!

139
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:41,032
Are you crazy?
Okay let's go now.

140
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:44,951
To the clinic. You don't
like me? You can stay there.

141
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,696
You only have to say it.
Here you are.

142
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,933
Come on!

143
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:53,696
So it's normal, but
what am I supposed to do?

144
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,623
Nothing, You don't
have to react.

145
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,401
If you stay quiet
she'll calm down.

146
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:03,398
- But, Professor...
- Call me by name, please...

147
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,045
Alright. But maybe I
did something wrong?

148
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,463
No, you didn't, my dear.

149
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,322
It's her disease's
fault, not yours.

150
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,514
But that's
what we're for.

151
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,284
Hey, is it ready?

152
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,233
Did you wash it?

153
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,086
I never ask them
to wash my car.

154
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,434
They like it.

155
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,370
It's their pastime.

156
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:45,587
<i>But you can't
mortgage this house!</i>

157
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,985
<i>This is your children's house...</i>

158
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:52,180
<i>To mortgage a
house is a normal thing.</i>

159
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,457
<i>The problem is
that you're from Milan.</i>

160
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,570
<i>You are extraordinary people,</i>

161
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:01,847
<i>- you're intelligent...
- What's that supposed to mean?</i>

162
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,814
<i>And so you
lack imagination.</i>

163
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,149
<i>- ability to dream.
- Sure, imagination...</i>

164
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,153
Chicca?

165
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:23,804
What are you doing
still up? Come here.

166
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:28,457
- How long have they been fighting?
- Since the film ended.

167
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,741
And did it and well?

168
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,280
Yes. He was a king
and he didn't know,

169
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:34,206
then he knew it and
married the princess.

170
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:35,782
- That's bad.
- Why?

171
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,632
Because then they'll
fight like mom and dad.

172
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,648
You must promise me
that when you grow old

173
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,977
you'll never get married.

174
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,062
I want to marry you.

175
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,042
And Nicola too.

176
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,802
You can't marry
your brothers,

177
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,464
especially two
of them together. So...

178
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:57,379
Let's put Alice to bed
and make them stop.

179
00:12:57,437 --> 00:13:00,621
- ...if you have a head on your shoulders.
- Hey people...

180
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,890
- Will you stop it please?
- Hey, will you stop it?

181
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:05,406
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

182
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,918
Poor thing, you're still up.

183
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:09,904
How could she sleep
with all that noise?

184
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:11,905
Tell me,
what should I do?

185
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:13,808
Leave Matteo be,
don't involve him in this.

186
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:16,170
You and Nicola must
defend me against your father.

187
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:18,846
What? Matteo,
am I a bad father?

188
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,292
Yes, wanna know what
the good father did?

189
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,460
He mortgaged his house.

190
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,239
You mortgaged this house?

191
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:27,963
No, the Palace of Caserta.
Of course, I own this house here!

192
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,489
Did you understand?

193
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,132
If his job ends badly
we'll go to sleep under a bridge.

194
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,368
Under a bridge!
Matteo, that's cool!

195
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,083
Oh, finally someone
who loves adventure!

196
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,567
Sure, we'll live like
tramps under a bridge.

197
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:43,695
But who cares of
how his job ends?

198
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,064
You're insane too!

199
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,781
He's right, not insane!

200
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,495
Leave it all to me.
I'm the head of the family.

201
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,805
What does that mean?

202
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:56,122
It means I know when
I can invest money.

203
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,425
You have to beat
competition, understand?

204
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,751
And then, I can
smell a good deal.

205
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,321
You smell good deals?
I thought that you could smell

206
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,372
a fart!

207
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,012
Go, go...

208
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,418
What a pity I can't ask
for divorce in this country.

209
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,499
<i>- Divorce? Like the American ladies?
- Yes like that.</i>

210
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,005
Well, see you.

211
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:17,447
You're going out again?

212
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,590
Yes, Nicola and the others
are waiting for me.

213
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,998
- Where are you going?
- Around.

214
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,763
- Girls?
- Who knows...

215
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:53,373
Where is she?

216
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,302
With a client, I think.

217
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,142
Shall we wait here?

218
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:00,965
Yes this is her fire.

219
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,751
It's a bit embarrassing.

220
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,772
It's not. She'll be here soon.

221
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,496
Is that her?

222
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,361
Yes.

223
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:20,595
<i>What's happening?</i>

224
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,503
Hi Cati.

225
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,387
Hi Matteo.

226
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,806
Who was that?

227
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,987
Who are those?

228
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,930
My brother
and two friends.

229
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,009
Hi.

230
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:43,814
Hi.

231
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:46,293
So, shall we go to your place?

232
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,233
Come in.

233
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,127
Can I leave the light on?

234
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:01,950
So the hens think
it's day and they'll eat.

235
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,723
It's okay.

236
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:13,994
Don't you get undressed?
Are you ashamed?

237
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,781
Understood.
I'll turn around.

238
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,575
Look, maybe it's better
if we do nothing.

239
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:32,905
- But I'll pay you all the same.
- Are you sick?

240
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:36,031
No, I'm not, but...

241
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,653
- I don't know. Maybe...
- Come on.

242
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,892
Listen, are you
Matteo's brother?

243
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:44,291
Yes, why?

244
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:46,430
Because you
two are different.

245
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,596
- You aren't like him.
- Really? Why, what's he like?

246
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,319
He's weird.

247
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,493
Well, anyway...

248
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:59,489
Let's do it quick or you'll
make me waste too much time.

249
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,304
No. Don't kiss my lips.

250
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,552
Hi Giorgia.

251
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:22,182
Why are you staying
here in the dark?

252
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:27,593
Don't you want to go out?

253
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:29,704
Everyone's in the garden.

254
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,363
Can I take some
pictures of you?

255
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,609
The light is perfect.

256
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,218
Come on, look at me.

257
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,422
Well?

258
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:53,015
Alright, I'll photograph your hands.

259
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:01,143
Your hands are pretty,
did you know that?

260
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,255
What's that?
What did they do to you?

261
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:44,052
Please read and
comment on this page.

262
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:51,997
It's a poem
by Sennuccio Del Bene.

263
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,720
I know, but what
does it suggest to you?

264
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,674
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Why?

265
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,478
Because it's empty.

266
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,351
Sennuccio Del Bene
is empty too.

267
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,324
Then give me an example

268
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:12,014
of a religious poet
you like in particular.

269
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,926
Il Beccaio.

270
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,933
Are you kidding me?

271
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:20,011
Il Beccaio, is a modest
imitator of Cecco Angiolieri,

272
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,663
and can't be considered as
one of the religious rhymers.

273
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,999
He curses his father
and his mother.

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,696
- Is that a religious poet?
- I think so.

275
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:31,978
Well, I don't, and I know
a little more than you.

276
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:35,423
What are you doing?

277
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,668
I got annoyed.

278
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:23,706
Yes those marks were
left by electrical discharges.

279
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,251
She was electroshocked.

280
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:29,240
- Where did you take the picture?
- Isn't the electroshock forbidden?

281
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,623
Unfortunately no.
Who's that girl?

282
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,822
I'll tell you later. Go study now.
Isn't your exam tomorrow?

283
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,392
Yes. Wish me good luck.

284
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:40,392
The teacher is a tough one.
I wish I got full marks like you.

285
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,641
Full marks...

286
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:43,874
Are you coming with Carlo
and Berto tomorrow?

287
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,980
So we can leave
as soon as I've failed?

288
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,929
No, come and take me from
"the hole". I'm going to sleep there.

289
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,352
With whom?

290
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,074
Hi Antonio.

291
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,740
Hey, most illustrious
one, why here so late?

292
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,020
Sorry, I forgot a book
in the hall upstairs.

293
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,756
- I can't move from here.
- Don't worry, I'll go get it.

294
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:13,957
If you wake them up,
you'll entertain them.

295
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,353
"Esposti Giorgia,
Pietracamela".

296
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:46,960
Giorgia?

297
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,056
Giorgia, wake up.

298
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,706
Wake up, Giorgia.

299
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,810
Don't be afraid, it's Matteo.

300
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,943
Listen to me carefully.

301
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,118
Now you take all your
stuff and we'll leave.

302
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,646
I'll take you away.

303
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:38,231
You deserved 28 or 29,

304
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:41,574
but I'm giving you 30
because of what I call

305
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:43,844
"sympathy quotient"

306
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,265
It's not much,

307
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:48,242
but it's enough
to make you get 30.

308
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,616
Someone disagrees with
this quotient thing of mine,

309
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,229
but I think that sympathy,

310
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,698
from the Greek word "sympazein"

311
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,052
which means "share the pathos",

312
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:05,746
or other people's sufferings,
is very important for a Doctor.

313
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,674
To others I apply the
"antipathy quotient".

314
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,425
It means I lower their marks.

315
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,188
Antipathy is the worst
thing for a Doctor.

316
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,972
I think you are praiseworthy,
congratulations.

317
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,130
But don't get big-headed.

318
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:21,161
You have to do
two more exams with me,

319
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:23,338
I can still tear you to pieces.

320
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:28,385
Who are those? Friends of yours?

321
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,187
Did you take the claque with you?

322
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,706
No. Well... we have
to leave together, so...

323
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,844
- They came here to...
- Are they in my class?

324
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,400
I can't remember them..

325
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:38,583
Ahem, no.

326
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:42,396
Carlo studies Economics,
Berto Philosophy.

327
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:44,002
Don't tell me the
story of their lives.

328
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:45,487
I'm just happy to know

329
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:48,035
they'll cause damage
somewhere else.

330
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:51,607
Economics, Philosophy. Wow!

331
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,358
As I said, you're promising.

332
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,563
And I may be wrong,

333
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,766
but I want to give
you a piece of advice.

334
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:02,288
If you're you somehow
ambitious, leave.

335
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,042
Leave Italy.

336
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,341
Leave Italy as
quickly as you can.

337
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:08,986
Do you want to be a surgeon?

338
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,259
I still don't know.

339
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:12,749
Whatever you decide,

340
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,518
go to study in
London or Paris.

341
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,598
Go to America if you can,

342
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,502
but leave this country.

343
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,046
Italy should be destroyed.

344
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,182
It's a beautiful
and useless place,

345
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,750
destined to die.

346
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,381
You mean the Doomsday
is about to come?

347
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:30,966
I wish.

348
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:33,747
We would be forced
to rebuild all if it did,

349
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,898
while everything remains
motionless instead,

350
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,862
in the hands of the dinosaurs.
Listen to me, go away.

351
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:41,788
Why are you staying though?

352
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:43,348
Me?

353
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:46,655
My dear, because I'm
one of the dinosaurs.

354
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,485
Move aside please.

355
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:53,349
Aside, aside, we're leaving!

356
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:55,423
I had thirty!

357
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:59,924
How can you have 30 at
your first exam! You're sick!

358
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,868
So, Matteo's in "the hole"?

359
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,137
- Yes.
- Drive faster!

360
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:05,896
I can't. 4,000
revolutions, remember?

361
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,542
- Yes but 4,000...
- Come on, 4,000!

362
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:25,246
4,000 my foot! Weeeeee!

363
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:43,725
Faster!

364
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,260
Giorgia?

365
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,393
Giorgia!

366
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,106
Wake up, it's time to go.

367
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:19,496
I made you some coffee.

368
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:23,099
Sugar?

369
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:25,095
One, two?

370
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:26,991
No sugar?

371
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:50,278
...I understand if
he was referring

372
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,614
to your specialisation,

373
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,194
But I don't think that going
abroad to find a job can...

374
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,156
So you think we'll
all find a job in Italy?

375
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:59,344
Yes, our yearly
growth is at 7%

376
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:01,454
and unemployment is at 3%.

377
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:03,500
- What does it mean?
- It means things are going well

378
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:07,299
because unemployment increases
when growth goes below 4%.

379
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,882
You mean that
will be begged to work?

380
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,360
No, that's a bit too much,

381
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,053
also because
within the next few years

382
00:27:15,054 --> 00:27:17,136
plenty of people will graduate.

383
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,047
Inflation should
increase a little.

384
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:21,439
So to speak, natural
selection will take place.

385
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,353
Let's say that
out of 3 graduated people,

386
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:26,294
one won't find any job.

387
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,598
Basically the
dumbest of the three.

388
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:33,767
Hey now, why
don't you all go to...

389
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,822
I think we should take
the "Statale Appenninica".

390
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,261
Sure, so we'll need
20 days to reach Turin.

391
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:43,311
Okay but girls don't
hitchhike on the highway.

392
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,393
- He fixed his mind on that!
- On what?

393
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,839
- But where's Matteo?
- I have no idea.

394
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,568
You should
go and check.

395
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,733
Okay, I'll get
the keys and...

396
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:55,134
Oh, there he is, finally.

397
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:00,984
Who's that?

398
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:03,150
I don't know her.

399
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,896
He was supposed
to come alone?

400
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:06,126
I don't know anything.

401
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,635
Wait here, please.

402
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:13,909
We said no girlfriends!

403
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,299
<i>Let's hear what he
has to say before.</i>

404
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:18,662
<i>Maybe she
isn't coming with us.</i>

405
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:23,244
That girl looks strange.
There's something about her.

406
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:29,262
Who's she? The
girl in the pictures?

407
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,430
<i>But what's the problem?</i>

408
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,363
Nothing, it's
a delicate matter.

409
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:37,360
And?

410
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:40,027
See you at the Brennero.

411
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:41,610
- Did you go crazy?
- Are you joking?

412
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,284
We were supposed to be
at the Brennero by night.

413
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,248
- We'll be a day behind now.
- Calm down.

414
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,928
- We'll never get to Hamburg.
- Calm down.

415
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,837
See you at the
customs in two days.

416
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,651
It's because of her?

417
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:51,942
Yes, because of her.

418
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:53,451
Did she run
away from home?

419
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:55,225
Kind of.

420
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,668
Where are you going?
We'll take you there.

421
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,597
No, we'll take care of it.

422
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:01,988
Okay then, good trip!

423
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:05,084
- You too.
- Good trip.

424
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,875
- See you.
- Good trip.

425
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:10,104
- Don't go too fast, okay?
- I won't.

426
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:14,416
<i>I don't know, when I saw
how bad she felt I thought...</i>

427
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,005
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

428
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,878
<i>And that matter of
the electroshock too...</i>

429
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:19,537
<i>You're right, it's horrible.</i>

430
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,529
<i>But we have to take
her somewhere now.</i>

431
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,507
Her mom is dead.

432
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:27,654
Her dad lives in a place
called Pietracamela.

433
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,273
Pietracamela?
Where is it?

434
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,100
I don't know, maybe
in the Appennino.

435
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:34,089
We could take her
there, then leave.

436
00:29:35,027 --> 00:29:36,936
Alright. Giorgia?

437
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:40,179
<i>Come here.</i>

438
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,080
<i>See how strange she acts?</i>

439
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:46,827
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

440
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:50,889
She's nuts!

441
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,386
No she isn't.

442
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:57,463
She looks intelligent.

443
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:42,123
Giorgia!

444
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:51,406
Do you remember me?

445
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:53,198
How are you, Giorgia?

446
00:31:53,306 --> 00:31:54,947
My Bishop forgets me,

447
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:57,837
while you still love
Don Vito, don't you?

448
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,388
Look at you!

449
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:02,741
You're so pretty...

450
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:04,394
- Who are those?
- Hello.

451
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,338
- Hello.
- Nicola.

452
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,282
- Vito.
- Matteo, nice to meet you.

453
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:11,702
- What's the matter?
- We're looking for Giorgia's father.

454
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,619
He moved a few years ago.

455
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:17,795
- He lives in Ravenna now.
- In Ravenna?

456
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,690
Yes, he moved there
three or four years ago.

457
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:22,497
Are you from the Institute?

458
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:24,470
Yes, from Villa Quieta.

459
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:27,324
And so young... Good boys.

460
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:30,915
And how come
you brought her here?

461
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,377
- For summer holidays.
- For summer.

462
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,362
She was confirmed
like all the others,

463
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:37,261
because children are
all the same for me.

464
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,538
Aren't they, Giorgi'?
Do you remember...

465
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:44,984
Lord, I'm not worthy of you,

466
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,344
but just say a word
and my soul will be saved.

467
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,647
- She's so pretty.
- Very good!

468
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:53,611
As a child she knew
the Angel's prayer.

469
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:58,328
But the Word of God
was nothing serious for her.

470
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,300
So it is for many other people.

471
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:04,936
You're right.
What's your name again?

472
00:33:04,937 --> 00:33:06,165
Matteo.

473
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,500
- And yours?
- Nicola.

474
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,822
Good boy, Nico'

475
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,632
<i>Maybe it was her mother's death.
She died when Giorgia was a child,</i>

476
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,396
<i>and she kind
of became obsessed.</i>

477
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:36,992
She cleaned everything,
over an over again.

478
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:40,420
She cleaned her room,
the kitchen, the stable...

479
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,813
<i>Who knows why.</i>

480
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,452
What time is the next
bus to Ravenna?

481
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:52,147
It's just left!
If you only said it earlier..

482
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,134
There's another one at 7 a.m.

483
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:55,996
which arrives
in the afternoon.

484
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:57,882
<i>Tomorrow morning?
We must leave immediately.</i>

485
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,170
Immediately?
That cannot be.

486
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,869
It's impossible.

487
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:03,864
What are we
going to do now?

488
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:05,520
You could stay at my place.

489
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,264
I have a kind of...
not a stable, a depot.

490
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:13,283
Better than a poke in the eye,
or a kick in the face! Isn't it?

491
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,774
<i>For you madam,</i>

492
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,669
<i>here's the Royal Suite.</i>

493
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,644
<i>You can lay down</i>

494
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:23,190
on this wonderful bed.

495
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:25,727
There's also a
fantastic séparé

496
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:29,159
so you can have your privacy,

497
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,485
separated from the two
heroes, Ajax and Achilles.

498
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,280
There's also a beautiful

499
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:39,479
blanket, by kind
concession of the clergy.

500
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,880
So if you're cold
you can put it on.

501
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,228
But I'm not
getting undressed.

502
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:48,680
I'm not.

503
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:54,432
That's fine.

504
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:57,360
You know what?
I won't get undressed too.

505
00:34:57,644 --> 00:34:59,654
Okay, let's get
some sleep now.

506
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,824
<i>Giorgia...</i>

507
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:19,453
Tomorrow you'll sleep in a real
bed in your father's house.

508
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:22,045
I don't have a father. I don't.

509
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:29,691
Give me that! Thief!

510
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:33,737
Give me that, bastard asshole!
You're a thief! A thief!

511
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:35,805
Let go of it! It's mine!

512
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:39,590
Giorgia!

513
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:43,148
- Come inside!
- Leave me be!

514
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,870
- Leave you be?
- Leave me be!

515
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,108
Leave me be!
Leave me be!

516
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,434
- Thief! Thief!
- Look...

517
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,305
- I'm not a thief!
- You are!

518
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,175
Sorry, I didn't know
it was yours.

519
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:56,773
- You're a thief!
- I found it on the floor!

520
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,114
Enough!

521
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,280
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I took a noteb-

522
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,956
- But I didn't know it was hers!
- Go away!

523
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,783
You have to go away!

524
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,527
Leave it to me.

525
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:16,887
Giorgia, let's go
inside, it's raining.

526
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:18,169
Enough!

527
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,595
Come on, we're
getting wet here.

528
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:23,197
Let's go back inside, please.

529
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,391
Maybe you better
wear something dry.

530
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:30,815
I'll give you something mine.

531
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,834
Do you like it?

532
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,593
Put it on.

533
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:37,645
Are you ashamed?

534
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,983
You can go
behind the curtain.

535
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,944
Come on.

536
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,504
Next time you want to
shower, just let me know,

537
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,968
and I'll book you a
room at the Grand Hotel.

538
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:00,830
Done?

539
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,271
How long does it take?

540
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:05,970
<i>The buttons...</i>

541
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,456
- May I?
- Yes.

542
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,920
I'll help you.

543
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:21,901
Buttons are
the hardest thing.

544
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:27,587
Shoelaces too, but buttons
are really complicated.

545
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:29,435
Imagine if Don Vito
comes in now.

546
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,060
He would curse us
and we'd go to hell.

547
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,854
You have a beautiful smile.

548
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:47,883
You're good, see?

549
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:51,847
Let's sleep now.

550
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,417
Let's go to beddy-byes.

551
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:01,790
Shall I turn off the light?

552
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,952
- No. No no.
- Alright, lights on.

553
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,944
Good night.

554
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,916
What happened?

555
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:36,453
Nothing.

556
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,163
<i>Good morning
madam. Excuse me...</i>

557
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,369
- Good morning.
- Do you know where Mr. Saro lives?

558
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:18,112
He lives here,
he's my husband.

559
00:40:18,197 --> 00:40:19,364
Where is he now?

560
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,869
What's wrong?

561
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:25,559
Nothing, it's
a personal matter.

562
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,544
Aren't you Giorgia?

563
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:29,910
You should have
been in the Institute.

564
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:33,113
And who are those?

565
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:34,874
Fatty...

566
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:53,435
Giorgia...

567
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,020
What are you doing here?

568
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,083
What happened?

569
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:04,599
We don't think the Institute
is the right place for her.

570
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:06,424
What?

571
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:08,845
She is ill-treated there.

572
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:11,342
And when she has a crisis
they electroshock her.

573
00:41:11,442 --> 00:41:12,947
- Electroshock?
- Yes.

574
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:16,468
- And what's that?
- Electric discharges.

575
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:20,460
- Aren't they painful?
- They are.

576
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:25,389
I pay a lot of money
to the Institute

577
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:28,097
so she can
recover and be well...

578
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:30,414
Why don't you keep
her with you instead?

579
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,386
I can't, I have other children.

580
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:36,501
Then keep her in the
family with her siblings.

581
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,267
They aren't her siblings,

582
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,926
they're Rosa's kids.

583
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:44,474
Rosa loves you,
and they do as well,

584
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:47,648
but you don't get
along with them.

585
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:49,378
In fact

586
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,156
I put you in that clinic
hoping for you to feel well,

587
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:54,105
and recover your health.

588
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,153
Giorgia,

589
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,657
now these people will
take you back to the clinic.

590
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,627
Why don't you try
to take her with you?

591
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:05,822
They'll take you back
so you'll be fine.

592
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:10,284
Giorgia doesn't need a
doctor. She needs a father.

593
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:11,933
I am a father!

594
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:16,138
I love you Giorgia,
you know that.

595
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,872
Then show her you do.
Take her to your house.

596
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,013
I cannot do that!
Life's expensive nowadays,

597
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,686
I already spend
a lot for the clinic...

598
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,984
Money's nothing to do
with her. She needs love.

599
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:31,414
- We love her! But...
- She feels awful, I know that!

600
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,909
Hey I'm not forced
to speak about my family

601
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,246
- with two strangers!
- What kind of father are you?

602
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:38,143
- And who the hell are you?
- She's your daughter!

603
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:41,217
She's my daughter so
she's none of your business!

604
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,920
- None of my business?
- Hey calm down!

605
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,155
Calm down!

606
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:51,817
Stop it now!

607
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:53,083
Damn you!

608
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:22,960
- Where are we going now?
- I don't know.

609
00:43:23,586 --> 00:43:26,764
You should think twice
before hitting her father!

610
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:30,743
- She can come with us.
- With us where?

611
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,480
To the appointment
with Carlo and Berto.

612
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,434
And what about the customs?

613
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,550
Where's her Passport?

614
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:39,975
You should use
your head sometimes!

615
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:44,565
Are you hungry?

616
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,841
No.

617
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,253
You don't eat or drink.
Do you live on air?

618
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:51,687
- And stop that-
- Leave her alone!

619
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:54,575
She cut herself.

620
00:43:56,998 --> 00:43:59,546
Come on, get a towel!

621
00:43:59,611 --> 00:44:02,130
- What if she cut her vein?
- Come on...

622
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,669
Maybe we should
take her to the ER.

623
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,051
There's no need for that.
Get a towel please.

624
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,673
This is the
Cheyenne method.

625
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:10,168
"Drooling Dew"

626
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,263
- What happened?
- Nothing, we broke a glass.

627
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,082
- Korea scored.
- Who cares?

628
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:29,408
In fact we
couldn't care less.

629
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,002
Less than nothing.

630
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:34,426
On the contrary,
I'm a fan of Korea.

631
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:37,690
Ko-re-a!
Ko-re-a!

632
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:04,096
- Bye.
- Bye.

633
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,082
- Wait for me here then.
- What will you tell Giovanna?

634
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:48,628
I'll tell her that we got
a problem after leaving.

635
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,727
But what if she asks why
Carlo and Berto aren't with us?

636
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:54,735
Trust me, okay?

637
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,133
I don't trust my sister.

638
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:01,241
- She could send us to jail.
- That's why I'm going alone.

639
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:03,711
- What about us?
- Think of something.

640
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,903
There's a bar, have
something to drink...

641
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,462
I'll leave my bags
here, okay?

642
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:09,860
- See you.
- Bye.

643
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:21,800
Do you want
something to drink?

644
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:28,745
Okay, you're mad at me.

645
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:30,843
You don't speak to me...

646
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,532
Give me a sign then.

647
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,107
Say "yes" or "no".

648
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,048
Was that "yes"?

649
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:45,744
- Hello.
- Hello, can I help you?

650
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:48,025
What would you like?

651
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:49,880
Hey!

652
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:51,642
Giorgia?

653
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:56,872
You want to
listen to something?

654
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:02,291
What's your favourite?

655
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:05,763
Elvis? Sandy Show?

656
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,721
What's "Achi"?

657
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:22,885
Oh, "A chi", Fausto Leali.

658
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,224
Let me see...

659
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,538
Here.

660
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:29,212
B 3.

661
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:39,884
Your friend Berto
did something serious.

662
00:49:40,115 --> 00:49:42,329
She is under her
father's jurisdiction

663
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,730
and he decides for her. There's
nothing I can do. It's the law.

664
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:48,933
But Berto thought she
would be killed in that clinic.

665
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,617
Then he could have
filed a complaint.

666
00:49:50,717 --> 00:49:52,139
That's what
the Magistracy's for.

667
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,680
He seized a person,
not a knick-knack.

668
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:56,945
Do you ever deal
with such cases?

669
00:49:57,045 --> 00:49:58,719
No, I'm dealing with that.

670
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:02,000
You won't believe me, but
thousands of people work there.

671
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,901
- So lots of problems?
- The usual job suits,

672
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:07,021
dismissals, diseases, accidents...

673
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:08,813
I've an embarrassing wide choice.

674
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,601
Plants never stop here.

675
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:14,613
They're on 24/7, all year.

676
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:17,299
That's why the sea and
the sky changed colour.

677
00:50:18,925 --> 00:50:21,027
The Leadership says
it's all under control,

678
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:23,327
but last week

679
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:25,110
they distributed this.

680
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:28,007
Toothpaste?

681
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:30,366
Yes, but they advised
for teeth to be brushed

682
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,745
before meals, not
after. Understand?

683
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:35,758
Not really.

684
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:39,781
It means that the powder
on their teeth and gums is toxic.

685
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:42,247
And it causes
cancer in the long run.

686
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:46,813
Listen, it's not Berto's
problem but yours, right?

687
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:49,227
No, it's Matteo's instead.
He always gets in trouble.

688
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:51,014
No, I promise
you it's Berto's.

689
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,823
Why don't you call the
Psychiatric Hospital in Gorizia?

690
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:55,804
There are wonderful
doctors there.

691
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:58,081
They may be wonderful,
but it's still an asylum.

692
00:50:58,168 --> 00:51:01,946
But their patients aren't
tied up or electroshocked.

693
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,791
What if we take her here?

694
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:06,914
I am forced to report
you to the local Attorney.

695
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:09,482
They come here, get the girl,

696
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,825
and take her back
to her father. Clear?

697
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:15,748
How long till the train leaves?

698
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,397
Half an hour.

699
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,837
Listen, why don't you go
and buy three "zatterini"?

700
00:51:21,618 --> 00:51:23,398
- Me?
- Yes, you.

701
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,138
No, I can't.

702
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:28,139
Why? You've got
legs, haven't you?

703
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,822
- I'll do it.
- No, she will.

704
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,866
Come on, three "zatterini".

705
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:44,380
- I can't do it.
- You can, it's easy.

706
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,370
Hi miss.

707
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:02,988
- Three "zatterini".
- Three "zatterini".

708
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,410
Do you think we should
really take her to Gorizia?

709
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,047
I think so.

710
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:11,792
Giovanna said it's a good hospital.

711
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:13,871
And if we don't like the doctors,

712
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:16,046
she'll spend the
holidays with us.

713
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:17,468
In Sicily.

714
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:22,381
Here you are.

715
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:30,751
Your change.

716
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:35,051
Wait, miss. Your change.

717
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,013
- Hello.
- Hello guys.

718
00:52:42,014 --> 00:52:43,706
- Two coffees please.
- Sure.

719
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,399
Miss, you left your change.

720
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:46,667
Take it.

721
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,824
He's asking you to
take your change...

722
00:52:49,014 --> 00:52:51,574
- Do you know her?
- No, I've never seen her before.

723
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:52,953
Is anything wrong?

724
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:55,433
I don't know, she left
her change here.

725
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:57,824
- I called her, but...
- I see.

726
00:52:58,015 --> 00:52:59,409
Are you with someone?

727
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,789
No, I'm alone.

728
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,278
Do you carry any documents?

729
00:53:04,452 --> 00:53:06,446
She isn't answering.
Let's take her with us.

730
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:07,648
Come with us.

731
00:53:52,387 --> 00:53:53,755
What about her bag?

732
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,788
I don't know..

733
00:54:02,714 --> 00:54:03,948
What's going to happen to her?

734
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,359
I don't know.

735
00:54:08,535 --> 00:54:11,490
Maybe she'll be taken
back to the Institute.

736
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:14,263
Is it possible that
there's nothing we can do?

737
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:24,254
Look, let's catch our train tomorrow.

738
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,361
Let's go on with our journey.

739
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:28,943
Alright.

740
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:34,631
Let's have some rest now.

741
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:40,755
Matteo, what are you doing?

742
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:44,093
My journey's over.

743
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:47,150
- Over? What do you mean?
- I'm going to Rome.

744
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,555
To Rome? Why?

745
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:52,511
What's wrong with you?
Have you gone crazy?

746
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:56,038
Remember the exam
I was supposed to take?

747
00:55:57,106 --> 00:55:58,115
Well?

748
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:00,437
I failed it.

749
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,013
Did you?

750
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,747
Why didn't you tell me?

751
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:08,009
And what's this got to do with
the fact you're going back to Rome?

752
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:12,796
- Nothing.
- Then get off!

753
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,681
Come on, the
train's leaving! Get off!

754
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:17,274
And you left me
on that bench like an idiot!

755
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:18,542
Get off!

756
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:19,753
Bye.

757
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,997
What does "bye" mean?

758
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:36,408
Nicola...

759
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:42,222
Nicola...

760
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:34,602
Where's the recruitment?

761
00:57:39,296 --> 00:57:40,326
What should I do

762
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:42,606
if I want to start military service?

763
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,194
What should you do?

764
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,364
You should look
for professional help.

765
00:58:55,778 --> 00:58:57,029
Dear Matteo,

766
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,463
I'm sending this
letter to mom and dad

767
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:01,679
so that they
can give it to you.

768
00:59:02,028 --> 00:59:03,579
Where are you?

769
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,284
Did you hear
from Carlo and Berto?

770
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:06,983
I never met them,

771
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:10,318
I travelled alone.
By the way here I am.

772
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,059
Norway is a wonderful place.

773
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,615
People are particularly striking.

774
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,017
Martin, for example, is American,

775
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:20,372
and he's a deserter.

776
00:59:20,373 --> 00:59:23,345
He left America because he
didn't want to go to Vietnam,

777
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:18,283
Holy...

778
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,441
The world is holy.

779
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:37,530
The soul is holy.

780
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:43,642
The tongue, the cock,

781
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:46,356
and hand

782
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:53,099
and asshole are holy.

783
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:54,755
Who wrote that?

784
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,533
- A genius.
- What's their name?

785
01:00:58,142 --> 01:00:59,407
Allen Ginsberg.

786
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:15,525
Savages...

787
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,564
I left my companions
and I'm heading north.

788
01:01:35,182 --> 01:01:36,768
You won't believe me,

789
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:39,216
but I am in front of
a small wooden church

790
01:01:39,532 --> 01:01:41,846
a few steps from
a stone which says that

791
01:01:41,946 --> 01:01:45,604
the Polar Arctic Circle
Line passes through here.

792
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,437
Right now
my fellow students

793
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:51,636
are having lesson
with the old dinosaur,

794
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:54,152
but I don't feel guilty,

795
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,209
I don't feel like
I'm wasting my time.

796
01:01:57,562 --> 01:01:59,051
Dear beast,

797
01:01:59,343 --> 01:02:01,348
I've something
important to tell you.

798
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:04,662
I'll never shave
or a have a haircut again.

799
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:06,994
I'm sending you a picture
to show you how I look.

800
01:02:08,406 --> 01:02:10,019
Pretty, aren't I?

801
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,805
What the hell are you doing?

802
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:44,905
...I don't like games, clear?

803
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:47,710
- Don't play with me!
- Calm down!

804
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,739
Don't break my balls!

805
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,037
- He's a weirdo.
- He's crazy!

806
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:04,105
- How are you?
- He hurt me.

807
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:42,356
My money's gone,

808
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:46,023
so I'll look for a job
in some local sawmill.

809
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:49,798
They pay workers well
and need workers all the time.

810
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:09,408
Girls are beautiful
here, serene...

811
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,726
without turning serious
as Italian girls do

812
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:13,702
when one pays
them a compliment.

813
01:04:24,257 --> 01:04:28,091
<i>Faster! Keep your butts down!</i>

814
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:32,688
<i>You wanna get killed?
You're a bunch of queers!</i>

815
01:04:32,897 --> 01:04:37,607
<i>Faster, or you'll
do it again and again!</i>

816
01:04:37,817 --> 01:04:40,729
<i>Come on, animals!
I'm gonna break your ass!</i>

817
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:57,808
Nicola Carati.

818
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:47,087
- Long beard.
- But I...

819
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:49,538
- Shut up! Step forward!
- Remember

820
01:07:49,539 --> 01:07:52,169
that you don't
represent only yourself.

821
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:55,548
You represent
the Army! Is it clear?

822
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,163
And another thing,
I want this to be clear:

823
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,921
No one plays games in here!

824
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:06,185
No bad jokes on
the recruits! Clear?

825
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,408
- Loosened tie.
- Step forward!

826
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:13,214
- Dirty shoes!
- Step forward!

827
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:15,060
And you call that a rucksack?

828
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:17,534
- Sorry.
- Back to your place!

829
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,854
Step forward!

830
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:21,050
Please Lieutenant,
don't do this to me.

831
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:23,707
I have to call mom,
she's no one to help her.

832
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,478
Dad is sick, I was
the only one who worked.

833
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,706
- I need to know if...
- Attention!

834
01:08:38,162 --> 01:08:40,570
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to go out!

835
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,262
Fine.

836
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:54,105
You won't go out tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow too!

837
01:09:00,587 --> 01:09:05,058
The confined ones stay here.
All the others out!

838
01:09:56,868 --> 01:09:59,185
<i>Sometimes I think of Giorgia.</i>

839
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:02,504
<i>...of the fact we
couldn't protect her.</i>

840
01:10:03,507 --> 01:10:07,546
<i>Maybe when I'm back
I'll become a Psychiatrist.</i>

841
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:11,456
<i>We must do something
for people like her.</i>

842
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:14,977
<i>They mustn't
be electroshocked.</i>

843
01:10:15,187 --> 01:10:19,783
You're great, Matteo.
You made fun of the Lieutenant.

844
01:10:21,507 --> 01:10:25,420
But you're strange. You had
him confine you for three days.

845
01:10:25,627 --> 01:10:30,417
And you could have
found a better excuse.

846
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:32,743
That's the truth.

847
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:36,826
I am unemployed,
I want to make a military career.

848
01:10:37,027 --> 01:10:39,623
Didn't you say you're
the only one with a job?

849
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:42,025
That's the only lie I told.

850
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:49,782
- You should make a career here too.
- Are you nuts?

851
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:52,051
You can become a General.

852
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:26,938
<i>Hurry up!</i>

853
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:29,748
<i>Faster!</i>

854
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,380
<i>Come on!</i>

855
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:41,551
<i>Faster!</i>

856
01:13:42,687 --> 01:13:43,909
Nicola!

857
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:45,690
<i>Attention!</i>

858
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:51,506
<i>Five minutes break
then we'll start. Stand at ease!</i>

859
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:53,489
<i>Dismiss!</i>

860
01:13:53,522 --> 01:13:54,696
Nicola!

861
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:57,989
Matteo!

862
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:05,929
- What's this military costume?
- I'm a military!

863
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:07,514
- What about University?

864
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:10,289
I left it. Luigi?

865
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:12,101
Luigi, come here.

866
01:14:13,251 --> 01:14:15,144
He's my brother Nicola,
he sent me the postcards.

867
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:16,247
- Hi.
- I'm Nicola.

868
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:20,619
- Is that my brother for real?
- You don't look like each other.

869
01:14:25,387 --> 01:14:29,062
<i>Excuse me...</i>

870
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,342
Excuse me.

871
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:37,465
Thanks.

872
01:14:39,427 --> 01:14:43,386
- Professor, are there precious books?
- I'm still checking.

873
01:14:43,587 --> 01:14:46,465
- I'll send someone to help you.
- Great, thank you.

874
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:51,263
Easy. Don't shake the water.

875
01:14:51,747 --> 01:14:54,584
Watch out. Be careful.

876
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:59,216
Those are precious books.

877
01:14:59,427 --> 01:15:02,419
- No need to hurry.
- It's slippery here.

878
01:15:04,707 --> 01:15:08,859
- Carati, where are you?
- At your orders! I'm here.

879
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,979
- Is everything under control here?
- Yes, no problem sir.

880
01:15:16,187 --> 01:15:19,224
- Then Pezzuco's following me.
- Alright.

881
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:33,451
- What was that?
- It's called "stecca". My God!

882
01:15:33,453 --> 01:15:35,060
You never did military
service, did you?

883
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,795
I don't even want to!

884
01:15:36,895 --> 01:15:38,008
Do you want
to be a tramp?

885
01:15:38,108 --> 01:15:40,278
I saved lots of money

886
01:15:40,627 --> 01:15:44,142
- working as a woodcutter.
- Good.

887
01:15:44,347 --> 01:15:46,826
- I'm not going back to Rome.
- And what about University?

888
01:15:46,827 --> 01:15:48,676
I'll enroll somewhere else.

889
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:50,959
After what
I saw around Europe

890
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:53,907
I can't keep on living
with mom and dad.

891
01:15:54,227 --> 01:15:57,178
- When will you be done with the Army?
- Never.

892
01:15:58,307 --> 01:16:01,822
- What do you mean?
- I'm making a career.

893
01:16:02,827 --> 01:16:05,739
- Where?
- I want to be a Policeman.

894
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:08,905
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

895
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:11,274
- You'll be a policeman?
- I will.

896
01:16:11,842 --> 01:16:13,253
You went nuts!

897
01:16:18,147 --> 01:16:19,882
Come on, you believed that?

898
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:22,634
- You were kidding?
- Come on, Nicola...

899
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:27,466
Look!

900
01:16:34,227 --> 01:16:39,459
Who knows what it used to be...
It's a miniated manuscript in Latin.

901
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:41,498
Let me get a torch.

902
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:47,826
"In 1126 A. D., the light..."

903
01:16:48,027 --> 01:16:53,385
- No, "The first light."
- "The first light of day came..."

904
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:56,566
- I can't remember that verb.
- "Came and alighted"

905
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:58,827
"Came and alighted on
the head of the Blessed One."

906
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:03,225
<i>What are you doing?
Why aren't you lined up?</i>

907
01:17:03,427 --> 01:17:05,888
<i>Hurry up!</i>

908
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:06,899
Did you hear him?

909
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:09,961
Such a jerk could be
your boss forever...

910
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:11,841
<i>Faster! Faster!</i>

911
01:17:11,842 --> 01:17:13,685
He's right by the way.
We're wasting time.

912
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:14,991
Pass me the books.

913
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:37,603
<i>- I can't believe it!
- Carlo! Berto!</i>

914
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:42,827
<i>- How long have you been here?
- Three days.</i>

915
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:46,247
You're a tramp!

916
01:17:46,347 --> 01:17:49,451
- You look like shit!
- I'm the "good savage"

917
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:53,179
- More like a woodcutter.
- Exactly!

918
01:17:53,387 --> 01:17:55,879
You made us wait
in Bolzano for two days!

919
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,547
- Three days!
- You weren't there when I arrived.

920
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:02,026
- Liar!
- I called your mom.

921
01:18:02,227 --> 01:18:06,425
- She said you were in Hamburg.
- Let's go get some food!

922
01:18:07,327 --> 01:18:11,018
- I took two exams all alone.
- I failed three exams all alone!

923
01:18:11,227 --> 01:18:13,779
- Let me see. "I think..."?
- "Therefore I am!"

924
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:16,332
- See, you're good!
- Why didn't you write at least?

925
01:18:16,427 --> 01:18:18,735
It was a wild
place. No stamps.

926
01:18:19,299 --> 01:18:20,834
Yeah sure...

927
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:23,661
What about
girls? No girls?

928
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:43,009
- Don't place it there.
- I was told to...

929
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:46,529
- No, their place is over there. follow me.
- Make up your minds...

930
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:10,089
<i>...mind the step there,</i>

931
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:13,391
or the bottles
will br- very good.

932
01:19:13,445 --> 01:19:16,970
Our soldiers came
here to help us.

933
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,209
<i>Give them some bread.</i>

934
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:21,880
- And wine too.
- How cute.

935
01:19:21,884 --> 01:19:23,541
Enough.

936
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:26,681
What are they doing?

937
01:19:27,752 --> 01:19:29,448
<i>Look at their coats...</i>

938
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:31,945
Those are Lorenzo
the Magnificent's nieces.

939
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:35,808
- ...Covered with mud...
- He's amazing too.

940
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:38,870
Looks like he came
from a book by Chekov...

941
01:19:39,397 --> 01:19:43,190
Remember Firs in
"The Cherry Orchard"?

942
01:19:44,024 --> 01:19:47,011
- Who's Firs?
- The old hunchback...

943
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:49,559
Never mind.

944
01:19:49,621 --> 01:19:51,776
No, I remember.

945
01:19:51,784 --> 01:19:53,118
...give him some bread too.

946
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:57,699
...good. To these
young men now.

947
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:03,326
- Good morning misses.
- Are you mocking them?

948
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,142
- Just joking...
- Then it's fine.

949
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,887
Give them some wine
and bread too. Here.

950
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:14,048
Who are those pretty girls?

951
01:20:14,107 --> 01:20:19,306
Marquis Riccobaldi's kids.
We were lucky.

952
01:20:19,507 --> 01:20:23,659
Our house is on the hills,
so it wasn't damaged.

953
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:27,985
And so the Marquis
sent his daughters

954
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:32,703
...to say thank you all.

955
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:37,662
- How nice of him!
- Him? I'm the one who's carrying the cart!

956
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,743
<i>Just kidding.</i>

957
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:45,421
I've played the piano since I was 10.

958
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:50,950
- Now I'm a Maths' student in Turin.
- What's Maths got to do with the piano?

959
01:22:52,587 --> 01:22:55,943
My mother chose
the piano, I chose Maths.

960
01:22:56,107 --> 01:23:00,419
- But why Maths?
- Because I wanted to solve

961
01:23:00,627 --> 01:23:02,649
the famous problem
of the jealous husbands.

962
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,846
What's that?

963
01:23:06,187 --> 01:23:08,906
- You don't know it?
- No.

964
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:14,495
- There are three married couples.
- Married?

965
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:17,386
- Yes.
- How boring...

966
01:23:19,347 --> 01:23:21,338
They have to cross a river.

967
01:23:21,507 --> 01:23:26,137
They only have a boat
which can carry two people.

968
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:28,338
The jealous husbands don't want

969
01:23:28,507 --> 01:23:31,741
their wives to remain
with the other men.

970
01:23:31,742 --> 01:23:32,956
Of course.

971
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:34,422
Where's the riddle?

972
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,972
How do they cross the river?

973
01:23:37,027 --> 01:23:40,383
It's easy. So...

974
01:23:40,867 --> 01:23:45,338
Two wives go first.

975
01:23:45,547 --> 01:23:49,540
One gets back
and takes her husband...

976
01:23:49,747 --> 01:23:53,017
...to the other side.
Mind your own business.

977
01:23:54,427 --> 01:23:58,215
She leaves him
there, gets back and...

978
01:23:58,427 --> 01:24:01,305
- No.
- She leaves him there. No.

979
01:24:01,507 --> 01:24:04,579
Two husbands go first...

980
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:06,698
It's the same, isn't it?

981
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:11,099
- I give up.
- It's easy you said?

982
01:24:11,307 --> 01:24:14,424
- No, I'll solve it.
- Maybe another time.

983
01:24:14,627 --> 01:24:18,256
- Okay.
- Once you've graduated,

984
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:21,664
...will you be a teacher or a pianist?

985
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:25,337
Not a teacher.

986
01:24:25,547 --> 01:24:27,822
Not even a pianist, I think.

987
01:24:28,027 --> 01:24:30,905
You know your business!

988
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:33,143
You must do both things.

989
01:24:33,347 --> 01:24:35,065
Sure...

990
01:24:35,627 --> 01:24:39,700
- Let's enrol in Turin.
- Why?

991
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:42,467
- Turin?
- He's crazy!

992
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:48,458
- Yes, he is.
- Berto, Let's go to Turin!

993
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:53,183
I won't graduate. Dad wants
me to work in his factory.

994
01:24:54,267 --> 01:24:58,101
- Don't laugh.
- What about you, Carlo?

995
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:01,424
- Torino?
- Yes, Agnelli, the FIAT...

996
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:05,415
<i>The chocolate... I don't know.</i>

997
01:25:08,507 --> 01:25:10,737
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

998
01:25:12,827 --> 01:25:15,057
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving you this.

999
01:25:15,267 --> 01:25:17,178
- Don't...
- Come on!

1000
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:23,938
Berto, I think we
should go to sleep.

1001
01:25:24,145 --> 01:25:25,388
I'm not sleepy.

1002
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,812
- Good night.
- Let's go.

1003
01:25:30,747 --> 01:25:34,023
- Bye.
- Good night.

1004
01:25:38,027 --> 01:25:41,542
- Did you send them away?
- I didn't.

1005
01:25:41,747 --> 01:25:43,738
Good night. Good night.

1006
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:52,784
Can I be your guest in Turin?

1007
01:25:52,987 --> 01:25:56,662
You're crazy,
I don't even know you!

1008
01:26:00,501 --> 01:26:02,859
TURIN, FEBRUARY 1968

1009
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:07,581
<i>Nicola? Pull it a little...</i>

1010
01:26:08,267 --> 01:26:12,146
<i>Move it to the right.</i>

1011
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:17,264
No... Look at him!

1012
01:26:17,467 --> 01:26:20,618
No! Nicola?

1013
01:26:21,627 --> 01:26:25,377
I love you.
I love you like crazy.

1014
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:29,423
Nicola, watch out!

1015
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:32,095
<i>Let go of them!</i>

1016
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:37,019
"Away, away the police!"

1017
01:26:37,227 --> 01:26:40,458
"Away, away the police!"

1018
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:47,665
See you.

1019
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:10,818
You brought the bike
in the house?

1020
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:14,815
Are you afraid that
the "terroni" steal it?

1021
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:18,815
- Shut up and make some food.
- Sure, honey!

1022
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:21,038
- With your holy hands.
- So holy!

1023
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:22,603
Where's Carlo?

1024
01:27:22,627 --> 01:27:27,025
- What?
- Here's "The voice of the Master".

1025
01:27:27,787 --> 01:27:33,305
One has to be informed

1026
01:27:33,507 --> 01:27:37,978
- as regards what they want too.
- You don't need papers for that.

1027
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:42,339
- They want to fuck us.
- That's an elegant gesture.

1028
01:27:42,865 --> 01:27:44,054
From Oxford.

1029
01:27:44,147 --> 01:27:48,060
By the way don't call me
a "terrone" anymore okay?

1030
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:51,065
- I am from Turin.
- Are you?

1031
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:54,777
- Ouch!
- Look at him!

1032
01:27:54,987 --> 01:27:57,660
He can't even laugh.

1033
01:27:57,867 --> 01:28:00,550
It's easy for the police
to face you sissies...

1034
01:28:01,265 --> 01:28:02,255
Shut up.

1035
01:28:03,747 --> 01:28:07,865
They should come to the
factory. We'd kick their asses!

1036
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:12,936
- Fast!
- Yeah, kick them...

1037
01:28:13,147 --> 01:28:18,824
- You can't because of the Labour Unions.
- Don't involve the Unions.

1038
01:28:20,107 --> 01:28:24,100
Who writes this bullshit? Your friends?

1039
01:28:24,496 --> 01:28:26,024
Did you read that?

1040
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:29,687
We were given this yesterday.

1041
01:28:29,718 --> 01:28:30,720
Alright, but...

1042
01:28:31,107 --> 01:28:32,838
"We must destroy
the school, not change it."

1043
01:28:32,839 --> 01:28:35,621
- You got it wrong.
- Listen.

1044
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:40,657
I don't want to destroy schools.
I want a right to study...

1045
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:44,860
...for me who couldn't
study, and for my children.

1046
01:28:45,027 --> 01:28:47,097
You have no children!

1047
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:53,942
- Learn to speak!
- But Vitale...

1048
01:28:54,147 --> 01:28:58,663
- It's true, you have no kids.
- I'm still young!

1049
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:02,985
Don't you have to go to the
students' collective's meeting?

1050
01:29:03,987 --> 01:29:07,980
- Who makes me some coffee?
- I will. And you have a meeting

1051
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:10,523
- at the factory, right?
- I'm going soon.

1052
01:29:10,524 --> 01:29:12,835
As long as you all leave.

1053
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:17,381
- Are you in a haste?
- I have to study Anatomy.

1054
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:21,701
- What?
- Anatomy.

1055
01:29:21,867 --> 01:29:26,258
(singing) Anatomy...

1056
01:29:26,467 --> 01:29:30,426
"Love me forever!"

1057
01:29:30,858 --> 01:29:34,009
Good morning Mr. Piero.

1058
01:29:34,138 --> 01:29:36,936
Hey, "Naples", you're so witty!

1059
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,608
- Hi Giulia.
- Hi.

1060
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:49,450
She's the Anatomy exam.

1061
01:29:50,658 --> 01:29:54,651
(singing) Anatomy...

1062
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:08,534
- Ouch! My lip...
- Sorry, I forgot.

1063
01:30:13,151 --> 01:30:17,571
- You're frozen.
- No, I ran. I'm hot.

1064
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:22,249
- It's so cold in here.
- The trick is to keep moving.

1065
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:26,377
- You need to keep moving.
- Keep moving?

1066
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:25,172
TURIN, SPRING OF 1974

1067
01:31:44,138 --> 01:31:45,696
There.

1068
01:32:06,018 --> 01:32:09,610
Please open up! I'm pregnant!

1069
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:12,127
<i>Open up please!</i>

1070
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:13,327
Open the door!

1071
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:28,332
<i>It's like heaven in here.</i>

1072
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:34,769
<i>- Nice, isn't it?
- Would you live here?</i>

1073
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:39,487
Yes. Wouldn't you?

1074
01:32:47,618 --> 01:32:53,011
- You carry bricks in your pocket?
- You saw how hard they hit people...

1075
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:56,883
What do you do then?

1076
01:32:57,909 --> 01:32:59,596
You throw bricks at them?

1077
01:33:02,365 --> 01:33:06,051
I don't, but if they
assault me I'll defend myself.

1078
01:33:12,858 --> 01:33:18,251
Weird... Someone opened
the door, but no one's showing.

1079
01:33:21,438 --> 01:33:25,487
You found a great
excuse... "Help!"

1080
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:30,533
"Open up, I'm pregnant!"

1081
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,232
Slow down! Slow down!

1082
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:51,370
Stop at the crossing.

1083
01:33:55,187 --> 01:33:56,329
Hey!

1084
01:34:01,338 --> 01:34:06,253
First and Second turn right!
Third and Fourth turn left!

1085
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:09,980
Slow down.

1086
01:34:10,485 --> 01:34:12,407
Slow down, I don't like it.

1087
01:34:15,018 --> 01:34:16,895
There's something wrong here.

1088
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:22,491
Back!

1089
01:34:22,618 --> 01:34:24,609
Back!

1090
01:34:27,338 --> 01:34:29,329
Hurry up!

1091
01:34:32,618 --> 01:34:36,816
Away! Quick!

1092
01:34:37,418 --> 01:34:40,251
Go away!

1093
01:34:46,818 --> 01:34:48,570
Anyone missing?

1094
01:34:50,258 --> 01:34:51,475
Luigi!

1095
01:34:54,018 --> 01:34:56,009
Bastards!

1096
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:16,206
Luigi! Luigi!

1097
01:35:18,221 --> 01:35:19,687
Luigi!

1098
01:35:25,049 --> 01:35:26,005
Gigi!

1099
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:17,949
How are you?

1100
01:36:20,478 --> 01:36:24,107
How strange to meet again here.

1101
01:36:24,318 --> 01:36:27,230
Weren't you in Treviso?

1102
01:36:27,878 --> 01:36:32,190
I was, but they needed
help for the demonstration.

1103
01:36:32,318 --> 01:36:34,707
Nice idea!

1104
01:37:02,398 --> 01:37:05,470
Was it for self-defence?

1105
01:37:08,798 --> 01:37:12,586
If they hadn't stopped me
I would have killed him.

1106
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:22,951
- Will you be tried now?
- I don't know.

1107
01:37:24,598 --> 01:37:27,795
- But I'll be transferred.
- Where to?

1108
01:37:27,918 --> 01:37:30,716
Bologna. I'm leaving tomorrow.

1109
01:37:33,398 --> 01:37:37,391
The boy you hurt will make it.

1110
01:37:41,478 --> 01:37:43,946
I don't give a damn.

1111
01:37:46,718 --> 01:37:50,950
Do you want to keep
behaving like that?

1112
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:09,146
Let's start over.

1113
01:38:13,078 --> 01:38:16,036
Hi Matteo. How are you?

1114
01:38:17,678 --> 01:38:22,911
Wanna come to my place?
I'll show you the house.

1115
01:38:24,318 --> 01:38:27,867
What do you need
to get out of here?

1116
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:33,390
Gotta ask for 70 permissions
to the Minister of the Interior?

1117
01:38:34,718 --> 01:38:37,994
Gotta lick the floor where
the Head of Police walked?

1118
01:38:38,718 --> 01:38:43,109
Gotta pray St. Michael,
patron Saint of the Police?

1119
01:38:45,078 --> 01:38:50,630
- I only need to sign some papers.
- Do it then!

1120
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:57,357
This is the yard.

1121
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,436
- Hello, "tota" Bianco.
- Hello.

1122
01:39:01,558 --> 01:39:05,710
"Tota" means "miss" in dialect.
I'll buy a cake.

1123
01:39:05,838 --> 01:39:08,511
- We gotta celebrate!
- What?

1124
01:39:08,718 --> 01:39:10,868
I'll tell you later.

1125
01:39:45,558 --> 01:39:49,471
- Ay, my good sire?
- Light of my life!

1126
01:39:49,718 --> 01:39:53,677
- You always forget the keys.
- Sorry love. He's Matteo.

1127
01:39:56,478 --> 01:39:58,867
- Hi.
- Hi.

1128
01:39:59,438 --> 01:40:00,712
Come in.

1129
01:40:02,318 --> 01:40:04,115
Thanks.

1130
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,110
Gigi is paralysed.

1131
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:19,633
You met him during
the flood in Firenze. Remember?

1132
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:24,193
Of course. We look like
the same in our uniforms.

1133
01:40:26,078 --> 01:40:27,007
Is he a friend of yours?

1134
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:30,098
- We're all friends.
- That's bad!

1135
01:40:31,038 --> 01:40:33,151
Really Why?

1136
01:40:33,226 --> 01:40:34,998
Because you're
on the wrong side.

1137
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:36,767
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1138
01:40:36,902 --> 01:40:38,561
And which one's
the right side?

1139
01:40:38,678 --> 01:40:40,576
- The side of the poor?
- Exactly.

1140
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:46,549
Luigi knows what to be
poor means. He is poor!

1141
01:40:46,678 --> 01:40:50,671
- Those who hit him aren't. Are you?
- That's nonsense!

1142
01:40:50,798 --> 01:40:56,634
- I don't hit innocents!
- But he's on the wheelchair, not you!

1143
01:40:56,758 --> 01:41:01,673
- I can't stay here anymore.
- Giulia, please.

1144
01:41:08,058 --> 01:41:09,271
Nice woman...

1145
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:12,331
I see you made friends.

1146
01:41:12,638 --> 01:41:16,929
We're celebrating our
child's birth in September.

1147
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:20,135
A child? Did you
choose its name?

1148
01:41:20,313 --> 01:41:21,579
Sara!

1149
01:41:21,738 --> 01:41:26,254
- What if it's a boy?
- Giulia says it's a girl. I trust her.

1150
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:30,371
It's a nice name, from the Bible.

1151
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:35,891
- Is she playing?
- Yes.

1152
01:41:39,938 --> 01:41:42,023
She doesn't seem
mean when she's playing.

1153
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:43,868
She isn't mean.

1154
01:41:45,698 --> 01:41:49,452
- She thinks she's always right.
- Exactly like you...

1155
01:41:58,098 --> 01:42:00,089
Sleep.

1156
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:15,730
- Nicola!
- Does the baby have to sleep with us?

1157
01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:21,973
- That's not good.
- Hush...

1158
01:42:22,338 --> 01:42:26,650
Sara, please go to
the other room, will you?

1159
01:42:26,778 --> 01:42:32,728
Cause daddy has a little
thing to do with mommy.

1160
01:42:36,058 --> 01:42:37,047
Go!

1161
01:42:38,258 --> 01:42:42,456
He could have come
to pick us at least!

1162
01:42:42,578 --> 01:42:46,173
Try to be kind, and don't say

1163
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:49,115
that to have kids when
you have no job is crazy.

1164
01:42:49,116 --> 01:42:54,767
- Also because Nicola has one.
- Only for six more months.

1165
01:42:54,854 --> 01:42:57,531
- She works too.
- Yes, in a rubbish shop.

1166
01:42:57,751 --> 01:43:01,591
How can they buy clothes
and miniskirts for Sara?

1167
01:43:01,883 --> 01:43:03,845
Isn't it early for miniskirts?

1168
01:43:04,258 --> 01:43:07,853
And don't mention the fact
they aren't married.

1169
01:43:07,978 --> 01:43:10,562
No one gets
married anymore!

1170
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:14,333
Why, you wouldn't
marry me today?

1171
01:43:24,818 --> 01:43:30,097
- You don't think it's good enough?
- What are you saying!

1172
01:43:32,898 --> 01:43:34,889
Ladder A

1173
01:43:40,138 --> 01:43:42,129
Hi!

1174
01:43:43,058 --> 01:43:44,979
- How are you?
- Fine. The journey?

1175
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,900
- It was good.
- Open up please?

1176
01:43:47,498 --> 01:43:52,572
- What's that?
- An English baby-carriage.

1177
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:56,454
- Thanks! It's beautiful!
- Here's the rest.

1178
01:43:56,955 --> 01:43:58,338
Put it there.

1179
01:44:00,178 --> 01:44:01,372
Hi.

1180
01:44:01,883 --> 01:44:04,119
This house is big.

1181
01:44:04,178 --> 01:44:08,410
- We were lucky to find it.
- Was it so coloured?

1182
01:44:08,538 --> 01:44:12,372
- No, I painted it.
- Congratulations!

1183
01:44:16,258 --> 01:44:18,055
She's sleeping.

1184
01:44:31,818 --> 01:44:35,945
Hi... she's so cute!

1185
01:44:36,065 --> 01:44:40,762
I'm grandma,
and he's grandpa.

1186
01:44:40,763 --> 01:44:42,454
Such a cute face...

1187
01:44:42,578 --> 01:44:47,015
She's got my
eyes and my chin.

1188
01:44:47,138 --> 01:44:52,895
- You wish!
- Let her grow and we'll see.

1189
01:44:54,428 --> 01:44:58,083
- She's bigger than the last time.
- She is.

1190
01:44:58,161 --> 01:45:00,773
If someone told me
I'd become grandpa...

1191
01:45:01,289 --> 01:45:04,944
Sara are you happy to have
such a young grandad?

1192
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:09,091
- She's looking at me!
- You conquered her.

1193
01:45:10,098 --> 01:45:12,579
- Where's Nicola?
- At the Court.

1194
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,963
What happened?

1195
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:18,612
There's a trial against
a sick psychiatrist.

1196
01:45:19,083 --> 01:45:21,566
- Nicola's there to help.
- He must testify?

1197
01:45:21,567 --> 01:45:24,154
No, the patients will.

1198
01:45:24,218 --> 01:45:28,928
They were accepted as witnesses.
Let's hope that the Judge trusts them.

1199
01:45:29,058 --> 01:45:33,927
It would be the first time in Italy.
No, in the World!

1200
01:45:34,698 --> 01:45:39,169
<i>Marino, when they say
"Swear to tell the truth"...</i>

1201
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:43,291
<i>You all listen, because
you all will be asked for that.</i>

1202
01:45:43,418 --> 01:45:46,949
<i>You have to reply: "I do".
Marino, repeat please.</i>

1203
01:45:46,971 --> 01:45:47,764
<i>I do.</i>

1204
01:45:47,765 --> 01:45:50,416
<i>Good. otherwise
they won't listen to you.</i>

1205
01:45:50,538 --> 01:45:53,404
<i>When did you first
enter the mental hospital?</i>

1206
01:45:54,418 --> 01:45:55,511
I was four...

1207
01:45:55,512 --> 01:46:00,332
No you were 8. You
must say that, okay?

1208
01:46:00,966 --> 01:46:04,863
Yes, I was 8, I liked
to dress like a girl.

1209
01:46:04,864 --> 01:46:08,811
- And they weren't supposed to shut you in.
- When I see the "Electrician",

1210
01:46:08,938 --> 01:46:11,930
- I'll break his bones!
- Calm down!

1211
01:46:12,058 --> 01:46:16,574
- You won't do that because you're good.
- Nicola!

1212
01:46:16,698 --> 01:46:20,054
You'll calm down.
Promise me, Aldo.

1213
01:46:21,463 --> 01:46:23,767
<i>- Look me in the eye.
- Nicola?</i>

1214
01:46:23,858 --> 01:46:27,851
<i>- Will you stay calm?
- Nicola! Nicola!</i>

1215
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:33,565
- Yes, Mario?
- It looks like my cousin Ignazio.

1216
01:46:34,298 --> 01:46:36,368
That's true!

1217
01:46:37,618 --> 01:46:42,868
- Where did you find those?
- Behind the statue.

1218
01:46:42,869 --> 01:46:46,984
Don't pick up anything,
please. You all don't.

1219
01:46:48,624 --> 01:46:50,871
Who brought them in?

1220
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:55,442
<i>- Swear to tell the truth.
- They made us enter together.</i>

1221
01:46:55,443 --> 01:46:58,828
<i>They had us lay down
on the lined up beds.</i>

1222
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:02,171
- No!
- You must say "I do" first.

1223
01:47:04,443 --> 01:47:08,457
I do. Eight years old. 10 times
in the hospital. 10 times in the hospital.

1224
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:12,914
The witness is playing
a part someone taught him!

1225
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:17,248
Of course he needs
to calm down a little.

1226
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,244
Mr. President...

1227
01:47:19,338 --> 01:47:23,543
- Mr. Levi, please say "I do".
- I do.

1228
01:47:24,207 --> 01:47:25,907
Please go ahead.

1229
01:47:26,647 --> 01:47:30,252
When the Electric Doctor
came into the room...

1230
01:47:30,258 --> 01:47:34,685
<i>I closed my eyes, but I could
hear those besides me screaming.</i>

1231
01:47:35,698 --> 01:47:39,691
<i>Four nurses blocked
my hands and feet.</i>

1232
01:47:40,058 --> 01:47:43,777
I felt a hand putting some
rubber stuff inside my mouth.

1233
01:47:45,098 --> 01:47:47,771
Then the first shock came.

1234
01:47:50,098 --> 01:47:55,730
Once I escaped from the hospital,
but they found me again.

1235
01:47:56,218 --> 01:48:01,338
They hit me hard then
tied me up to the bed again.

1236
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:06,737
And then the Electrician
with his machine came in.

1237
01:48:09,658 --> 01:48:11,967
While

1238
01:48:14,098 --> 01:48:17,977
he shocked me, he shouted

1239
01:48:20,018 --> 01:48:24,409
"Tell me who helped you escape!"

1240
01:48:25,858 --> 01:48:30,010
I didn't want to tell him.

1241
01:48:31,258 --> 01:48:35,973
So I pressed
my jaws together...

1242
01:48:36,978 --> 01:48:41,733
so hard that I broke
all my upper teeth.

1243
01:49:27,898 --> 01:49:30,366
<i>Giovanbattista,
are you listening?</i>

1244
01:49:30,938 --> 01:49:33,836
<i>Here's the record
of your last deposition.</i>

1245
01:49:34,226 --> 01:49:37,445
Please repeat
what you know here.

1246
01:49:40,698 --> 01:49:41,982
Look at him.

1247
01:49:44,538 --> 01:49:47,360
<i>Is that the man you referred to?</i>

1248
01:49:48,858 --> 01:49:50,814
Can you speak?

1249
01:49:54,058 --> 01:49:56,288
You said...

1250
01:49:58,058 --> 01:50:02,051
<i>"The doctor gave me
electromassages because I drank."</i>

1251
01:50:02,738 --> 01:50:04,171
<i>Did you say that?</i>

1252
01:50:07,658 --> 01:50:11,625
"I had 5 in 5 days"

1253
01:50:12,775 --> 01:50:13,982
Is that true?

1254
01:50:15,538 --> 01:50:20,134
<i>- Five of them is normal for alcoholics.
- Shut up! Shut up!</i>

1255
01:50:20,338 --> 01:50:23,774
- You won't kill people anymore!
- Calm down.

1256
01:50:24,338 --> 01:50:27,887
If something like that happens
again I'll clear the courtroom.

1257
01:50:28,018 --> 01:50:32,728
I apologise for Aldo
and for all the others.

1258
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:39,248
They're upset, it's not easy
for them to speak in tranquillity.

1259
01:50:39,378 --> 01:50:42,290
Giovanbattista can't speak at all.

1260
01:50:42,418 --> 01:50:48,129
I know silence is no evidence,
but it's all he has to give.

1261
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:54,138
- I hope he gets eight life sentences.
- I'd be happy if he got a day.

1262
01:50:54,258 --> 01:50:59,616
It's a matter of principle.
Why did dad come to Turin?

1263
01:50:59,628 --> 01:51:02,684
He has a project and
is looking for a sponsor.

1264
01:51:02,685 --> 01:51:06,880
He says we should pass from
typing machines to don't know what,

1265
01:51:06,881 --> 01:51:10,103
processors, computers... I don't know.

1266
01:51:12,978 --> 01:51:17,158
I have to tell you something.

1267
01:51:21,138 --> 01:51:25,055
He doesn't know I found
them. He won't tell me about it.

1268
01:51:28,298 --> 01:51:30,937
But he seems worried.

1269
01:51:33,858 --> 01:51:37,646
I never searched
his drawers before.

1270
01:51:42,978 --> 01:51:45,856
You're a doctor.
Can you do something?

1271
01:51:48,218 --> 01:51:52,131
No mom. But the course of illness

1272
01:51:52,258 --> 01:51:56,951
can be slackened by some medicine.
It could take years before...

1273
01:51:56,952 --> 01:51:59,857
I know, I read
everything I could find.

1274
01:52:00,197 --> 01:52:01,933
I read the same
thing you said,

1275
01:52:03,743 --> 01:52:05,637
that nothing can be done.

1276
01:52:20,132 --> 01:52:21,198
What are you doing?

1277
01:52:21,261 --> 01:52:24,438
I'm writing some
notes for the trial.

1278
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:27,857
You're a disaster,
you type with two fingers!

1279
01:52:27,858 --> 01:52:30,338
- Let me type.
- No, there's no need to.

1280
01:52:30,339 --> 01:52:31,938
Please!

1281
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:34,679
I want to help.

1282
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:37,756
"The lawyer said

1283
01:52:39,561 --> 01:52:41,134
that the treatments

1284
01:52:41,751 --> 01:52:43,939
weren't a punishment

1285
01:52:44,729 --> 01:52:46,148
and also stated

1286
01:52:47,724 --> 01:52:48,957
that homosexuality

1287
01:52:49,478 --> 01:52:50,633
is a disease

1288
01:52:51,176 --> 01:52:53,153
which needs curing."

1289
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,220
Why, isn't it a disease?

1290
01:52:55,678 --> 01:52:57,271
No dad, it isn't.

1291
01:52:57,584 --> 01:52:59,109
- Are you sure?
- I am.

1292
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:01,481
Okay then I believe you.

1293
01:53:03,722 --> 01:53:05,287
What a piece of crap!

1294
01:53:05,343 --> 01:53:06,941
Change the carriage at least!

1295
01:53:07,511 --> 01:53:09,817
It's good for me.
Cut it out.

1296
01:53:09,818 --> 01:53:11,174
But it's out of fashion,

1297
01:53:11,175 --> 01:53:12,764
a general change is needed.

1298
01:53:12,765 --> 01:53:15,423
I have an idea, I'm
looking for a sponsor.

1299
01:53:15,853 --> 01:53:17,520
As a matter of fact,
if you don't mind,

1300
01:53:18,054 --> 01:53:20,926
I'd like to stay in Turin for
a while, to look for this sponsor.

1301
01:53:21,133 --> 01:53:22,820
There are many
experts in mechanics here.

1302
01:53:22,991 --> 01:53:24,956
Of course dad, it's good
for you to get busy.

1303
01:53:25,128 --> 01:53:27,099
I thought you'd say
I'm crazy as you mom does...

1304
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:29,072
No you aren't
crazy, you look ahead,

1305
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:30,644
you already live in the future.

1306
01:53:31,091 --> 01:53:32,516
You aren't fit for this world.

1307
01:53:33,204 --> 01:53:34,731
And what about mom?
Is she staying too?

1308
01:53:34,787 --> 01:53:36,159
No, she's leaving.

1309
01:53:36,259 --> 01:53:38,592
It's already strange that she
left Francesca alone for 4 days.

1310
01:53:39,242 --> 01:53:40,048
Look,

1311
01:53:41,389 --> 01:53:44,073
one of these days I'd like
to go and see Giovanna in Milan.

1312
01:53:46,292 --> 01:53:48,597
- I'll take a train.
- No, I'll take you there.

1313
01:53:48,768 --> 01:53:51,374
- Don't bother, I can-
- It's fine, so I can also see Carlo.

1314
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:53,431
- Do you remember Carlo?
- Of course I do.

1315
01:53:53,603 --> 01:53:55,219
Isn't he teaching in England?

1316
01:53:55,224 --> 01:53:57,094
Yes, he's only passing by.

1317
01:53:57,134 --> 01:53:58,380
So I can say hi to him.

1318
01:53:58,391 --> 01:54:00,841
I could tell him
about my project.

1319
01:54:01,028 --> 01:54:02,959
In England there are
Business Banks.

1320
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,221
It's not like in Italy.

1321
01:54:04,586 --> 01:54:05,981
Maybe he knows someone.

1322
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:07,712
Okay, dictate.

1323
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:13,220
What, are you playing?

1324
01:54:15,543 --> 01:54:16,944
You can't play

1325
01:54:17,177 --> 01:54:19,676
with two six of flowers.
Take them back.

1326
01:54:19,777 --> 01:54:20,627
Sorry.

1327
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:22,440
But I scored 40
points all the same.

1328
01:54:22,751 --> 01:54:24,930
You didn't. Count them.

1329
01:54:25,124 --> 01:54:26,966
- Come on.
- 3 times 6 makes 18, 20, 22...

1330
01:54:26,973 --> 01:54:30,113
- See, you didn't reach 40.
- I didn't. Sorry.

1331
01:54:31,151 --> 01:54:32,078
Adriana, listen.

1332
01:54:32,336 --> 01:54:33,156
Yes?

1333
01:54:33,186 --> 01:54:36,195
As regards that thing that
nowadays no one gets married,

1334
01:54:38,315 --> 01:54:39,828
I think that nowadays

1335
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:41,503
I would marry you.

1336
01:54:45,974 --> 01:54:47,576
My little thing.

1337
01:55:29,468 --> 01:55:31,836
<i>Did you find a house?</i>

1338
01:55:31,837 --> 01:55:32,545
No.

1339
01:55:34,031 --> 01:55:37,312
There's a dormitory here,
but no one wants to sleep in it.

1340
01:55:37,648 --> 01:55:38,546
It's fine with me.

1341
01:55:38,823 --> 01:55:40,092
I don't like houses.

1342
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:46,854
Why did you come here from
the Scientific Section in Bologna?

1343
01:55:47,115 --> 01:55:48,237
I didn't choose to.

1344
01:55:48,886 --> 01:55:50,223
They said you
need people here.

1345
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:53,409
- But you could say "no".
- I never say "no" to orders.

1346
01:55:55,164 --> 01:55:57,510
What are you doing?
Drop it, won't you?

1347
01:56:00,939 --> 01:56:02,175
What have you got in there?

1348
01:56:02,663 --> 01:56:03,564
Books.

1349
01:56:04,059 --> 01:56:04,832
Books?

1350
01:56:05,548 --> 01:56:06,505
<i>Yes, books.</i>

1351
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:09,229
You're a strange type.

1352
01:56:10,642 --> 01:56:12,523
I read your characteristic signs

1353
01:56:13,598 --> 01:56:14,778
and what did I find there?

1354
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:18,597
Nothing

1355
01:56:18,789 --> 01:56:19,852
I found.

1356
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:21,962
Apart from some mess.

1357
01:56:22,598 --> 01:56:23,968
Hot blooded, aren't you?

1358
01:56:24,052 --> 01:56:25,538
You're a fighter, right?

1359
01:56:26,162 --> 01:56:28,126
Why did you join the Police?

1360
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:29,418
What were you looking for?

1361
01:56:29,827 --> 01:56:30,945
Rules.

1362
01:56:31,257 --> 01:56:33,046
And what do you make of them?

1363
01:56:33,549 --> 01:56:34,700
I follow them.

1364
01:56:34,725 --> 01:56:36,032
<i>Do you?</i>

1365
01:56:36,148 --> 01:56:37,051
Yes.

1366
01:56:37,267 --> 01:56:38,526
<i>I do what I'm told to.</i>

1367
01:56:39,099 --> 01:56:40,996
Then I mind
my own business.

1368
01:56:40,997 --> 01:56:42,343
<i>Then you fit this place.</i>

1369
01:56:42,945 --> 01:56:45,758
Sicily is the home of those
who mind their own business.

1370
01:56:58,516 --> 01:57:01,122
<i>- What?
- He was shot in the head.</i>

1371
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:03,368
<i>And there's a hole in his brain.</i>

1372
01:57:18,054 --> 01:57:20,042
- You live nearby.
- Commissary, we're done.

1373
01:57:20,043 --> 01:57:21,621
Wait a minute, please.

1374
01:57:23,376 --> 01:57:25,965
- So you found the body?
- Yes.

1375
01:57:26,042 --> 01:57:27,794
- Early morning?
- Yes.

1376
01:57:27,975 --> 01:57:29,792
What were you
doing here so early?

1377
01:57:30,098 --> 01:57:32,460
I was pasturing the donkey.

1378
01:57:32,784 --> 01:57:35,388
- Oh, the donkey.
- Yes.

1379
01:57:35,474 --> 01:57:38,031
But the donkey found
the body, or you did?

1380
01:57:38,098 --> 01:57:40,035
- I did.
- Oh, you did.

1381
01:57:40,036 --> 01:57:41,710
- And you touched it?
- No.

1382
01:57:41,747 --> 01:57:44,914
Good boy, you didn't have to.

1383
01:57:45,738 --> 01:57:48,364
But you looked at him.
Who's that? Does he live here?

1384
01:57:48,887 --> 01:57:50,813
- Yes.
- So you knew him?

1385
01:57:51,718 --> 01:57:52,948
Did you know him or not?

1386
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:54,539
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

1387
01:57:54,843 --> 01:57:56,925
If he lived here,
you had to know him.

1388
01:57:56,926 --> 01:57:59,196
Tell me the truth, come on.
Did you recognise him?

1389
01:58:00,102 --> 01:58:01,318
Did you know him?

1390
01:58:01,418 --> 01:58:04,179
- I did.
- Good boy. You knew him then.

1391
01:58:04,628 --> 01:58:07,195
And tell me, was he a good man?

1392
01:58:07,705 --> 01:58:11,983
He was. Those who knew
him knew he was good.

1393
01:58:12,859 --> 01:58:16,415
A good man... But why
do you say he was good,

1394
01:58:16,416 --> 01:58:18,728
when others say he wasn't?

1395
01:58:20,335 --> 01:58:23,369
How do I know?
I know nothing of nothing.

1396
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:27,003
Right. After a certain point
you don't know anything anymore.

1397
01:58:27,004 --> 01:58:29,392
May the rats eat that bastard!

1398
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:31,780
- Bastard...
- May he rest in peace.

1399
01:58:31,781 --> 01:58:34,143
- Bastard.
- May he rest in peace, yes.

1400
01:58:34,243 --> 01:58:36,929
Okay, I got it.
Did you see?

1401
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:42,383
<i>Please everyone show
the due respect to the Court.</i>

1402
01:58:43,723 --> 01:58:45,053
<i>Whatever the verdict is,</i>

1403
01:58:45,646 --> 01:58:48,086
I don't want to hear
any noise or comment.

1404
01:58:49,519 --> 01:58:50,491
<i>The Court,</i>

1405
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:54,972
<i>according to Articles 483 and 488
of the code of criminal procedure,</i>

1406
01:58:55,834 --> 01:58:59,077
<i>finds the defendant guilty
of the crime he's accused of,</i>

1407
01:58:59,398 --> 01:59:02,017
<i>and sentences him
to 5 years' imprisonment,</i>

1408
01:59:02,092 --> 01:59:04,239
<i>and the payment of legal costs.</i>

1409
01:59:05,417 --> 01:59:07,971
<i>Order! Order!</i>

1410
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:15,504
I must say I like these colours

1411
01:59:16,314 --> 01:59:17,683
after getting used to them.

1412
01:59:18,311 --> 01:59:21,349
And these drawings are really nice.

1413
01:59:21,465 --> 01:59:23,564
Congratulations.

1414
01:59:25,149 --> 01:59:26,465
Listen...

1415
01:59:27,257 --> 01:59:30,284
- Can I ask you for something?
- Sure.

1416
01:59:31,934 --> 01:59:34,523
There's a piano in the other room,

1417
01:59:36,341 --> 01:59:37,860
why don't you ever play it?

1418
01:59:38,419 --> 01:59:40,495
I never play it because

1419
01:59:40,865 --> 01:59:42,415
I'm not good enough.

1420
01:59:42,447 --> 01:59:45,416
One can't be only a little good,

1421
01:59:45,954 --> 01:59:47,631
so I decided to stop playing.

1422
01:59:47,688 --> 01:59:50,331
I didn't ask you why you
don't play in front of an audience.

1423
01:59:50,355 --> 01:59:51,881
I meant why
don't you play it here?

1424
01:59:52,057 --> 01:59:53,571
At home, for yourself.

1425
01:59:53,884 --> 01:59:55,197
For myself?

1426
02:00:16,585 --> 02:00:17,561
What's wrong?

1427
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:18,787
I'm done.

1428
02:00:19,283 --> 02:00:20,172
Why?

1429
02:00:20,526 --> 02:00:22,316
Because I made lots of mistakes.

1430
02:00:22,491 --> 02:00:23,930
I didn't notice them.

1431
02:00:24,241 --> 02:00:25,709
You didn't, but I did.

1432
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:27,930
But you're playing for me
so they don't count.

1433
02:00:28,024 --> 02:00:30,162
Ahead with this Ravel, come on.

1434
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:34,571
I like Ravel.

1435
02:01:34,152 --> 02:01:37,174
Do you ever ask her to play?

1436
02:01:37,837 --> 02:01:38,654
No.

1437
02:01:39,716 --> 02:01:40,976
Why?

1438
02:01:41,036 --> 02:01:42,832
Because I know
she doesn't want to.

1439
02:01:44,954 --> 02:01:47,881
That's not true, she
played the other day.

1440
02:01:47,927 --> 02:01:49,647
She did it for you.

1441
02:01:50,412 --> 02:01:51,808
It was a special thing.

1442
02:01:51,893 --> 02:01:53,616
You don't understand.

1443
02:01:54,426 --> 02:01:57,299
You're so smart and
yet you don't get it.

1444
02:01:57,579 --> 02:01:59,613
Women must be
told they're good,

1445
02:02:00,122 --> 02:02:01,005
that they're beautiful,

1446
02:02:01,502 --> 02:02:03,431
that they're the
best thing we have.

1447
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:06,133
You should tell her:
"Giulia play for me".

1448
02:02:07,299 --> 02:02:08,947
"Play for the two of us".

1449
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:11,892
You should behave
as I did with your mother.

1450
02:02:11,893 --> 02:02:14,083
What? You fight all the time!

1451
02:02:14,127 --> 02:02:16,021
Fights are good,

1452
02:02:16,324 --> 02:02:17,979
They're good to keep fit.

1453
02:02:19,802 --> 02:02:23,161
<i>The 26 principles and
the 109 recommendations of the UN</i>

1454
02:02:23,173 --> 02:02:25,292
<i>approved in Stockholm 2 years ago,</i>

1455
02:02:25,651 --> 02:02:27,940
are constantly
disregarded in Italy.

1456
02:02:29,021 --> 02:02:31,723
Above all by people like those
who are to be judged today,

1457
02:02:31,776 --> 02:02:34,741
<i>and for whom I ask for
the maximum of the penalty.</i>

1458
02:02:36,448 --> 02:02:39,147
<i>I also ask for them to be
charged of the legal costs</i>

1459
02:02:39,148 --> 02:02:40,912
and of the damage costs.

1460
02:02:40,914 --> 02:02:44,555
Because they willingly discharged
waste products to a river

1461
02:02:44,556 --> 02:02:47,911
<i>damaging the environment
and the health of the citizens.</i>

1462
02:02:47,912 --> 02:02:49,529
Think of this:
in the last ten years

1463
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:53,270
1.870 billion dollars
a year were spent

1464
02:02:53,486 --> 02:02:55,372
for military purposes.
A year, understand?

1465
02:02:55,567 --> 02:02:58,698
Now, 50% of this money
was spent for bribes,

1466
02:02:58,699 --> 02:03:00,989
also in Italy. Wouldn't you
put them under arrest?

1467
02:03:01,315 --> 02:03:03,003
Give me the names.

1468
02:03:03,004 --> 02:03:05,499
- Tell her about public enterprises.
- What are you, a prompter?

1469
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,322
No, she knows about those,
as the names are in the papers too.

1470
02:03:08,323 --> 02:03:10,145
But she has to read them.

1471
02:03:11,026 --> 02:03:14,078
Dad? What... Look.

1472
02:03:14,527 --> 02:03:16,229
- Old chopsticks.
- Dad?

1473
02:03:17,071 --> 02:03:18,428
- "Folk".
- Okay, okay...

1474
02:03:18,511 --> 02:03:20,269
Don't listen to him.
This is the crab's technique.

1475
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:23,760
Sure, it's the calamari's.
I'll use the fork.

1476
02:03:27,241 --> 02:03:29,863
Will your banger
make it to the airport?

1477
02:03:30,378 --> 02:03:31,480
How dare you?

1478
02:03:31,791 --> 02:03:33,221
Take a taxi then.

1479
02:03:33,296 --> 02:03:34,973
Why are you
going to Cambridge?

1480
02:03:35,711 --> 02:03:37,224
There's much to do here too...

1481
02:03:37,293 --> 02:03:38,157
I know, I'll be back.

1482
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:40,767
I'm studying for a Master.

1483
02:03:40,988 --> 02:03:43,106
Then I think I'll be
back next year. I wanted

1484
02:03:43,265 --> 02:03:45,459
to apply to the Bank of Italy.

1485
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,931
Didn't I tell you he wants
to become a Governor?

1486
02:03:47,975 --> 02:03:49,740
He wants to sign the banknotes.

1487
02:03:49,741 --> 02:03:52,865
Let's drink to the future Governor.

1488
02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:55,550
Long live the Governor!

1489
02:03:55,551 --> 02:03:57,103
Long live the Governor!

1490
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,069
<i>I know it sounds absurd,</i>

1491
02:04:10,153 --> 02:04:12,142
but if you want him
to think he can make it,

1492
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:14,086
you must believe it too.

1493
02:04:14,338 --> 02:04:15,254
Not just pretend.

1494
02:04:15,516 --> 02:04:17,635
- But he doesn't know we know.
- It doesn't matter.

1495
02:04:17,663 --> 02:04:20,185
It doesn't matter,
your father can feel it.

1496
02:04:20,602 --> 02:04:23,178
he can feel everything,
he can feel it if you care.

1497
02:04:23,179 --> 02:04:24,951
- He can feel you all.
- Carlo, I'm a doctor.

1498
02:04:24,952 --> 02:04:26,241
I can't believe in miracles.

1499
02:04:26,242 --> 02:04:28,399
Then forget you're
a doctor for a while.

1500
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,922
Okay, I understood.
You're my friend,

1501
02:04:30,022 --> 02:04:33,355
you want to help, I understood.
Thanks. Enough though.

1502
02:04:34,989 --> 02:04:37,828
- Sorry.
- Thanks. Thank you.

1503
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:55,132
I think it's my plane.

1504
02:04:59,782 --> 02:05:01,810
Sorry about before.

1505
02:05:01,811 --> 02:05:04,702
No, I'm sorry.
I talked nonsense.

1506
02:05:06,894 --> 02:05:09,250
Try not to behave
like an asshole in England.

1507
02:05:09,696 --> 02:05:12,326
Try not to behave
like an asshole here.

1508
02:05:25,824 --> 02:05:27,293
I didn't tell anyone.

1509
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:30,781
Not even Nicola.

1510
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:33,569
He would have started
with psychology,

1511
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:35,628
with the fact that
you need to react,

1512
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,817
all that bullshit, you know.

1513
02:05:40,148 --> 02:05:43,342
I told you... because I told you.

1514
02:05:44,836 --> 02:05:46,406
This is our secret.

1515
02:05:46,684 --> 02:05:48,866
You must promise me, because
I don't want anyone's pity.

1516
02:05:48,911 --> 02:05:51,610
But you must promise me
you'll have yourself cured,

1517
02:05:51,611 --> 02:05:53,880
and tested and so on.

1518
02:05:53,881 --> 02:05:56,448
I'll do everything.

1519
02:05:59,829 --> 02:06:01,621
Be patient with Matteo.

1520
02:06:04,011 --> 02:06:05,696
I don't know why,

1521
02:06:06,796 --> 02:06:08,275
but I've never understood him.

1522
02:06:09,555 --> 02:06:11,161
And I'm sorry for that.

1523
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,028
Then there's Francesca...

1524
02:06:14,331 --> 02:06:15,275
and mom,

1525
02:06:16,234 --> 02:06:17,292
and Nicola.

1526
02:06:18,155 --> 02:06:19,373
Nicola is strong.

1527
02:06:20,247 --> 02:06:22,443
He isn't all the time.

1528
02:06:22,469 --> 02:06:24,347
He's like everyone else.

1529
02:06:29,239 --> 02:06:31,166
And last but not least

1530
02:06:31,707 --> 02:06:33,306
you have to take care of yourself.

1531
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:35,448
You have to smile.

1532
02:06:35,449 --> 02:06:36,936
Be cheerful,

1533
02:06:37,033 --> 02:06:38,182
have fun.

1534
02:06:39,909 --> 02:06:41,891
Where's your husband?
Out for work?

1535
02:06:41,892 --> 02:06:43,571
We haven't seen
each other for a while.

1536
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:45,923
There are some problems.

1537
02:06:45,924 --> 02:06:46,707
Another woman?

1538
02:06:47,093 --> 02:06:50,717
Not at all. There are
just some problems.

1539
02:06:51,129 --> 02:06:52,930
I think we'll ask for separation.

1540
02:06:53,122 --> 02:06:55,195
Separation? And you
weren't telling me?

1541
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:57,972
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

1542
02:06:58,923 --> 02:07:00,637
It's better this way.

1543
02:07:02,609 --> 02:07:03,670
It is!

1544
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:05,410
We'll find another one.

1545
02:07:23,923 --> 02:07:25,558
<i>Are you looking for mystery?</i>

1546
02:07:26,506 --> 02:07:27,459
Are you talking to me?

1547
02:07:30,283 --> 02:07:31,809
You must find the soul.

1548
02:07:34,503 --> 02:07:35,856
How can I find it?

1549
02:07:38,427 --> 02:07:41,182
You have to search for it,
look inside people.

1550
02:07:42,303 --> 02:07:45,135
PALERMO, SUMMER OF 1977

1551
02:07:46,435 --> 02:07:47,837
Can you look inside?

1552
02:07:49,764 --> 02:07:50,533
I can.

1553
02:07:55,845 --> 02:07:56,917
See that child?

1554
02:07:57,267 --> 02:07:58,185
<i>Look at his hand.</i>

1555
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,938
<i>He's confident.</i>

1556
02:08:00,175 --> 02:08:03,210
He has a cockade on his shirt,
he's top of the form.

1557
02:08:04,866 --> 02:08:05,733
Maybe.

1558
02:08:07,642 --> 02:08:08,810
See that old lady?

1559
02:08:09,903 --> 02:08:12,175
<i>Two wedding rings,
she's a widow.</i>

1560
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:14,134
<i>And she feels lonely.</i>

1561
02:08:19,219 --> 02:08:20,558
You aren't Sicilian.

1562
02:08:21,657 --> 02:08:22,929
Are you making fun of me?

1563
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:27,863
Did you see the film "Stromboli"?
The one with Ingrid Bergman?

1564
02:08:28,003 --> 02:08:30,190
- Yes.
- That's where I live.

1565
02:08:30,935 --> 02:08:32,046
But I'll leave soon.

1566
02:08:32,537 --> 02:08:34,594
I applied for a job as a
librarian in Palermo.

1567
02:08:35,225 --> 02:08:36,623
I want to leave the island.

1568
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:41,991
What about that? It's
a professional camera.

1569
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:43,584
Are you an expert?

1570
02:08:44,893 --> 02:08:46,445
I'm an expert in libraries too.

1571
02:08:46,615 --> 02:08:47,352
Are you?

1572
02:08:47,635 --> 02:08:48,343
I am.

1573
02:08:48,522 --> 02:08:50,672
So if I got the job,
what library should I choose?

1574
02:08:51,201 --> 02:08:52,173
In Palermo I don't know,

1575
02:08:53,185 --> 02:08:57,269
but in Rome there's a beautiful
one in Villa Celli Montana.

1576
02:08:59,053 --> 02:09:00,465
Can I look for mystery?

1577
02:09:00,543 --> 02:09:02,057
Come on...

1578
02:09:09,904 --> 02:09:10,848
Sorry I have to go.

1579
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,302
- Now?
- Yes.

1580
02:09:14,196 --> 02:09:17,023
- What's your name?
- Nicola.

1581
02:09:17,837 --> 02:09:19,673
- Mirella.
- Pleased to meet you. Sorry. Bye.

1582
02:09:19,674 --> 02:09:20,564
Bye Nicola.

1583
02:09:22,571 --> 02:09:24,205
- What happened?
- Someone was killed.

1584
02:09:24,206 --> 02:09:25,719
The Commissary wants
you to take some photos.

1585
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,604
- I don't have the camera.
- I do.

1586
02:09:28,342 --> 02:09:30,224
Wow, you never forget
anything, do you?

1587
02:09:30,225 --> 02:09:31,436
Where did you find it?

1588
02:09:33,004 --> 02:09:34,731
Look at me!

1589
02:09:36,294 --> 02:09:39,054
That's too easy.
Look at daddy.

1590
02:09:39,376 --> 02:09:40,758
Look at me.

1591
02:09:43,894 --> 02:09:45,830
I hurt myself.

1592
02:09:47,398 --> 02:09:49,701
How many times must I say
Sara must be in bed at this hour?

1593
02:09:49,801 --> 02:09:51,325
Did the doctor prescribe that?

1594
02:09:51,377 --> 02:09:53,588
<i>Daddy's a doctor!
He can decide!</i>

1595
02:10:08,826 --> 02:10:09,544
What's wrong?

1596
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:11,295
I'm tired.

1597
02:10:14,663 --> 02:10:16,194
I fought with Stefania.

1598
02:10:16,195 --> 02:10:19,489
I told her I'm done with the shop.
I've had enough of arguing all the time.

1599
02:10:21,048 --> 02:10:23,163
- You used to like arguing.
- I did once.

1600
02:10:25,994 --> 02:10:27,076
Maybe it's better this way,

1601
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:30,068
so you can go back
to play the piano.

1602
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:30,942
I sold it.

1603
02:10:31,138 --> 02:10:32,464
Someone will take
it away tomorrow.

1604
02:10:33,825 --> 02:10:34,881
Are you crazy?

1605
02:10:35,563 --> 02:10:36,523
Maybe I am.

1606
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:41,367
Where have you been?

1607
02:10:42,082 --> 02:10:43,204
Do you control me?

1608
02:10:45,516 --> 02:10:47,419
I went to a meeting of the Collective.

1609
02:10:47,702 --> 02:10:49,011
Anything against that?

1610
02:10:49,012 --> 02:10:51,093
- Those are really good people...
- What do you mean?

1611
02:10:52,366 --> 02:10:54,862
There's nothing decent in this
country. Everything sucks.

1612
02:10:55,237 --> 02:10:56,662
And we do nothing about it.

1613
02:10:57,136 --> 02:10:59,156
Did you hear of that boy
who was killed in Bologna?

1614
02:11:00,073 --> 02:11:01,254
Yes, I did.

1615
02:11:01,255 --> 02:11:03,502
And when are we going
to make them cry too?

1616
02:11:05,053 --> 02:11:06,737
When are we going
to make them cry too?

1617
02:11:07,664 --> 02:11:09,495
Take off that thing!
You're ridiculous!

1618
02:11:18,124 --> 02:11:19,950
- Listen...
- Let go of me.

1619
02:11:19,966 --> 02:11:21,856
- You can't even stand me now?
- No!

1620
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:24,696
I can't even stand you.

1621
02:11:26,649 --> 02:11:28,446
You only care for your hospital.

1622
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,817
Everything's on my shoulders.

1623
02:11:31,839 --> 02:11:33,147
I don't agree.

1624
02:11:34,592 --> 02:11:37,850
I hate arguments!
I hate fighting couples!

1625
02:11:40,318 --> 02:11:41,766
Ladies and gentlemen?

1626
02:11:44,532 --> 02:11:45,764
<i>Ladies and gentlemen?</i>

1627
02:11:46,303 --> 02:11:51,280
Bobby can't sleep
with this noise.

1628
02:11:53,174 --> 02:11:55,478
You're right, love.
We'll all stay quiet now.

1629
02:11:59,823 --> 02:12:01,103
Dear Carlo,

1630
02:12:01,282 --> 02:12:03,822
I'm happy to hear of
your success in Cambridge.

1631
02:12:04,304 --> 02:12:05,838
Here things are
the same as usual.

1632
02:12:06,484 --> 02:12:08,672
It's not easy to work
inside the Institutions,

1633
02:12:08,673 --> 02:12:10,856
trying to change them little by little.

1634
02:12:12,568 --> 02:12:14,524
Giulia and I have got problems.

1635
02:12:17,025 --> 02:12:19,279
She became aggressive and hostile.

1636
02:12:19,633 --> 02:12:22,163
She's unsatisfied with
something I can't understand.

1637
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:27,049
We've slept like brother
and sister for 6 months now.

1638
02:13:16,503 --> 02:13:18,950
Follow me, I'll show
you the dormitory.

1639
02:13:19,804 --> 02:13:22,619
Who sends these inspectors, I wonder...

1640
02:13:23,504 --> 02:13:25,054
The Minister of Health, madam.

1641
02:13:25,103 --> 02:13:26,417
True, the Minister of Health.

1642
02:13:26,418 --> 02:13:28,727
And who are you? A lawyer?
A judge? Please open up.

1643
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:31,504
- I'm a psychiatrist.
- Good.

1644
02:13:31,819 --> 02:13:34,167
Here's the dormitory.

1645
02:13:35,018 --> 02:13:37,206
As you see it's clean

1646
02:13:37,506 --> 02:13:39,232
everything's tidy.

1647
02:13:40,301 --> 02:13:41,476
Where are the patients?

1648
02:13:41,477 --> 02:13:43,528
I sent them to a trip

1649
02:13:43,953 --> 02:13:46,648
to the Sanctuary of Europa,
because I care for them.

1650
02:13:47,124 --> 02:13:50,108
I want them to feel
well, to have fun.

1651
02:13:50,109 --> 02:13:51,853
To feel like normal people.

1652
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:55,564
Where are you going?
There's nothing there.

1653
02:13:55,565 --> 02:13:57,366
There's just a basement.

1654
02:13:57,367 --> 02:13:58,704
- What's inside here?
- Nothing.

1655
02:13:58,752 --> 02:14:00,618
- Open the door.
- There's just a store.

1656
02:14:00,619 --> 02:14:02,632
- Don't!
- Marshal, please...

1657
02:14:02,716 --> 02:14:04,743
You must have a
search warrant first!

1658
02:14:04,744 --> 02:14:06,771
I want to call my lawyer first!

1659
02:14:06,847 --> 02:14:07,686
Come on!

1660
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:12,735
Where are you going? See?

1661
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:15,130
Are you happy now?
There's nothing here.

1662
02:14:15,925 --> 02:14:17,892
Only garbage.

1663
02:14:18,148 --> 02:14:22,449
Where are you going?
You can't do that!

1664
02:14:22,536 --> 02:14:24,219
- It's an empty room!
- Stand aside!

1665
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:26,535
Marshal, please.

1666
02:14:26,536 --> 02:14:28,850
I protest! It's not fair!

1667
02:14:28,912 --> 02:14:29,984
Take her to the radio car,

1668
02:14:30,269 --> 02:14:32,196
and if she offers
resistance, handcuff her.

1669
02:14:32,955 --> 02:14:33,723
The door.

1670
02:14:41,953 --> 02:14:45,932
...water... water...

1671
02:14:59,448 --> 02:15:00,843
Call some ambulances.

1672
02:15:01,744 --> 02:15:03,133
Untie them and cover them.

1673
02:15:03,134 --> 02:15:04,523
Please Marshal...

1674
02:15:24,452 --> 02:15:25,261
Giorgia?

1675
02:15:35,994 --> 02:15:38,032
Now Giorgia put on the sweater.

1676
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:39,658
Be good.

1677
02:15:40,587 --> 02:15:43,120
We'll give it to you and you'll
wear it by yourself, okay?

1678
02:15:43,291 --> 02:15:44,073
Here.

1679
02:15:45,906 --> 02:15:46,857
Let's do this,

1680
02:15:47,395 --> 02:15:49,337
I leave it here
and we'll turn around.

1681
02:16:15,583 --> 02:16:16,592
Please Giorgia.

1682
02:16:16,997 --> 02:16:18,474
It's okay, I'll manage it.

1683
02:16:19,387 --> 02:16:20,247
Thanks.

1684
02:16:30,175 --> 02:16:31,041
How are you?

1685
02:16:38,712 --> 02:16:39,734
Did you eat?

1686
02:16:46,371 --> 02:16:47,402
Do you want some?

1687
02:16:53,276 --> 02:16:55,344
Remember the journey
we took together?

1688
02:16:58,075 --> 02:16:59,282
Don Vito's village?

1689
02:17:00,271 --> 02:17:02,456
That time we slept in a hayloft.

1690
02:17:06,468 --> 02:17:08,379
Do you remember the soccer match?

1691
02:17:09,629 --> 02:17:12,266
Italy were losing and
we laughed and laughed...

1692
02:17:18,946 --> 02:17:20,151
Do you remember Matteo?

1693
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:28,621
The orange.

1694
02:17:38,322 --> 02:17:40,495
It must drink or it'll die.

1695
02:17:58,581 --> 02:17:59,809
You're right.

1696
02:17:59,831 --> 02:18:01,370
I always forget it.

1697
02:18:07,806 --> 02:18:09,783
Sorry, I won't touch you.

1698
02:18:15,781 --> 02:18:17,685
But I'd like you to
come here every day,

1699
02:18:21,272 --> 02:18:23,267
to water the plant, or it'll die.

1700
02:18:34,022 --> 02:18:36,353
- The Judge? Did you call him?
- Yes.

1701
02:18:37,357 --> 02:18:39,533
- When?
- Two hours ago.

1702
02:18:41,868 --> 02:18:43,314
And he's still not here?

1703
02:18:46,593 --> 02:18:48,419
What? You're smoking
in a slaughterhouse?

1704
02:18:48,455 --> 02:18:50,757
- Please, put it out.
- Put it out!

1705
02:18:51,022 --> 02:18:52,457
We should leave...

1706
02:18:52,604 --> 02:18:54,288
Can we move it?

1707
02:18:54,701 --> 02:18:57,379
Move it? First the judge
comes and then we move it.

1708
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:58,512
Always the same questions.

1709
02:18:58,525 --> 02:18:59,747
Our shift's over.

1710
02:18:59,843 --> 02:19:02,182
The shift you said?
There's a dead man here!

1711
02:19:06,283 --> 02:19:08,837
Enzo, what did I say?
Tell them to keep quiet.

1712
02:19:08,838 --> 02:19:11,879
- They don't want to!
- Force them!

1713
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:14,920
Okay, go away everyone.
Please leave.

1714
02:19:14,921 --> 02:19:16,274
What? There's a child here!

1715
02:19:16,275 --> 02:19:18,318
Are you all nuts? Get out! Out!

1716
02:19:18,565 --> 02:19:20,796
Are you his dad?
Take him away!

1717
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:22,490
Is the child bothering you?

1718
02:19:22,491 --> 02:19:23,592
Take him away!

1719
02:19:23,748 --> 02:19:25,603
Who do you think you are?

1720
02:19:26,128 --> 02:19:27,311
How dare you?

1721
02:19:27,328 --> 02:19:28,800
Do you think
it's a nice show?

1722
02:19:30,005 --> 02:19:31,951
There's a dead man
here! It's not a film.

1723
02:19:32,916 --> 02:19:34,345
Where were you
when he was shot?

1724
02:19:34,913 --> 02:19:37,211
I don't know! I don't
remember, I wasn't here!

1725
02:19:37,212 --> 02:19:40,478
He doesn't know! Like the
rest of you, nobody knows!

1726
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:41,682
He died by himself!

1727
02:19:41,842 --> 02:19:44,172
And then show him to children
too, so they can learn.

1728
02:19:44,173 --> 02:19:46,314
- Go away.
- Don't touch my son!

1729
02:19:46,381 --> 02:19:48,953
- What are you teaching him?
- You won't touch him!

1730
02:19:56,699 --> 02:19:58,615
Here's an extraordinary permit.

1731
02:19:58,803 --> 02:20:00,960
I don't want to see
you for 2 weeks.

1732
02:20:01,164 --> 02:20:04,075
Go on holiday, go home,
do as you please,

1733
02:20:04,086 --> 02:20:05,191
but get lost.

1734
02:20:06,889 --> 02:20:09,214
I already have too
many problems here.

1735
02:20:09,215 --> 02:20:11,095
What do you want to prove?

1736
02:20:11,695 --> 02:20:13,259
Out of my sight!

1737
02:20:13,463 --> 02:20:14,444
Get lost!

1738
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:22,850
- Carati, what happened?
- All's well.

1739
02:20:22,950 --> 02:20:24,551
- But will you be transferred?
- Nah.

1740
02:20:24,577 --> 02:20:27,128
Special leave.
That's how it works.

1741
02:20:27,496 --> 02:20:28,874
It could have been worse.

1742
02:20:29,445 --> 02:20:32,135
Oh, here you are.
It arrived this morning.

1743
02:20:37,726 --> 02:20:38,658
Dear Matteo,

1744
02:20:39,297 --> 02:20:41,164
I have good news.

1745
02:20:42,468 --> 02:20:43,679
I found Giorgia.

1746
02:20:44,776 --> 02:20:47,037
I think she suffered a lot,

1747
02:20:47,917 --> 02:20:50,790
but it seems as if
time stopped for her.

1748
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:53,533
I was very excited
when I found her.

1749
02:20:53,934 --> 02:20:57,083
I remembered that summer
of many years ago,

1750
02:20:57,084 --> 02:21:00,232
when my life, yours, and
many others' changed.

1751
02:21:01,301 --> 02:21:02,532
And I thought

1752
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:05,517
why don't you leave the
headquarter for a few days

1753
02:21:05,518 --> 02:21:07,236
and come to see her in Turin?

1754
02:21:08,856 --> 02:21:11,728
What took place in April
wasn't an isolated phenomenon,

1755
02:21:11,729 --> 02:21:13,625
it wasn't just an
outbreak of violence,

1756
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:16,362
<i>because it followed
50 days of fights at the FIAT,</i>

1757
02:21:16,363 --> 02:21:18,487
<i>fights which involved
a huge number of workers</i>

1758
02:21:18,488 --> 02:21:20,652
<i>and blocked the whole
production cycle,</i>

1759
02:21:20,653 --> 02:21:23,650
<i>showing how much
power the workers have</i>

1760
02:21:23,651 --> 02:21:25,762
<i>on a political and
organizational level.</i>

1761
02:21:26,261 --> 02:21:28,932
<i>I don't like it.
Too bureaucratic.</i>

1762
02:21:29,906 --> 02:21:32,266
There's a difference
between desires and needs.

1763
02:21:32,267 --> 02:21:33,763
Needs are a serious matter.

1764
02:21:33,918 --> 02:21:36,958
Needs lead us to bring
it all up for discussion,

1765
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:37,909
to risk everything,

1766
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:40,332
to die and fight, if necessary.

1767
02:21:40,772 --> 02:21:42,487
For example the
need for communism...

1768
02:21:43,673 --> 02:21:45,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

1769
02:21:45,973 --> 02:21:47,026
Excuse me.

1770
02:21:47,333 --> 02:21:48,552
You came home
earlier today.

1771
02:21:49,161 --> 02:21:51,921
Yes, I did.

1772
02:21:53,216 --> 02:21:54,059
Hi Sara.

1773
02:21:54,299 --> 02:21:56,353
- Hi.
- Are you drawing?

1774
02:21:56,354 --> 02:21:57,224
Yes.

1775
02:21:57,598 --> 02:21:59,124
Let's go for a walk.

1776
02:21:59,351 --> 02:22:00,505
Hurray!

1777
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:03,097
Enclosed space
is not good for a child.

1778
02:22:04,054 --> 02:22:05,722
And for people's brains.

1779
02:22:06,475 --> 02:22:08,638
<i>The need for communism...</i>

1780
02:22:08,881 --> 02:22:10,904
<i>I need to drink, to eat...</i>

1781
02:22:10,905 --> 02:22:13,176
<i>Sara, when you
hear this bullshit...</i>

1782
02:22:13,177 --> 02:22:15,144
<i>You said a swearword!</i>

1783
02:22:15,145 --> 02:22:16,344
<i>Sometimes one has to.</i>

1784
02:22:16,345 --> 02:22:18,724
<i>When someone lies
to you at the kindergarten,</i>

1785
02:22:18,755 --> 02:22:21,314
<i>- what do you tell them?
- Shitty liar!</i>

1786
02:22:21,315 --> 02:22:22,234
<i>Good!</i>

1787
02:22:22,253 --> 02:22:25,709
Now let's go out
for a nice walk.

1788
02:22:27,681 --> 02:22:30,285
- See ya'll!
- See ya'll!

1789
02:22:30,444 --> 02:22:32,934
It's cold outside,

1790
02:22:33,052 --> 02:22:36,149
so we take your coat with us.

1791
02:22:36,245 --> 02:22:39,184
Let's go take
a breath of air.

1792
02:22:39,185 --> 02:22:40,763
<i>Out, out...</i>

1793
02:22:44,825 --> 02:22:47,818
- Listen Giulia...
- I know, it's a problem I have to solve.

1794
02:23:13,153 --> 02:23:16,862
Hello. Luigi Pezzuco please.

1795
02:23:18,073 --> 02:23:19,665
Thanks.

1796
02:23:59,473 --> 02:24:03,591
I was lucky too, doctors
always tell me that

1797
02:24:03,713 --> 02:24:08,184
a few more millimetres
and I would have lost my arms too.

1798
02:24:08,313 --> 02:24:12,864
Everything works instead.
Almost everything.

1799
02:24:13,273 --> 02:24:16,345
I even met a woman. Patrizia.

1800
02:24:17,473 --> 02:24:19,862
Let me show you...

1801
02:24:20,673 --> 02:24:25,303
I have a picture of us which
someone took at a party.

1802
02:24:27,233 --> 02:24:30,623
It has to be here... Here it is!

1803
02:24:35,513 --> 02:24:38,346
She's beautiful. Congratulations!

1804
02:24:38,473 --> 02:24:42,944
We'll get married in September.

1805
02:24:43,073 --> 02:24:46,349
We also want to have children.

1806
02:24:46,473 --> 02:24:49,545
You wanna know how we do it?

1807
02:24:49,673 --> 02:24:54,872
Slowly, patiently. She likes it
all the same, she says.

1808
02:24:54,993 --> 02:24:59,987
- Of course.
- But this was only possible

1809
02:25:00,113 --> 02:25:03,150
thanks to your mother.

1810
02:25:03,273 --> 02:25:06,071
- My Mother?
- Matteo...

1811
02:25:08,113 --> 02:25:10,707
I have a few notebooks like this one.

1812
02:25:14,713 --> 02:25:19,025
Without your mother, this hand
wouldn't have recovered.

1813
02:25:20,833 --> 02:25:26,300
- Did she come here?
- Once in every week.

1814
02:25:26,618 --> 02:25:27,796
You didn't know?

1815
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:32,710
- I did.
- And not only my hand recovered.

1816
02:25:33,082 --> 02:25:37,668
Also my brain. I had never
read poems before.

1817
02:25:38,273 --> 02:25:40,184
Listen:

1818
02:25:40,753 --> 02:25:43,347
"Ettore, you'll be
honoured with tears"

1819
02:25:43,553 --> 02:25:47,151
"shed where the holy blood you
poured for your country lies..."

1820
02:25:47,344 --> 02:25:49,053
What did I write here?

1821
02:25:49,233 --> 02:25:53,112
"Till the sun shines
on human misfortunes".

1822
02:26:49,713 --> 02:26:51,988
Doctor Carati?

1823
02:26:53,353 --> 02:26:57,062
What a surprise!
How are you?

1824
02:26:57,193 --> 02:26:59,232
- Fine. You?
- Fine.

1825
02:26:59,233 --> 02:27:01,510
- The beard?
- Sara says it stings.

1826
02:27:01,804 --> 02:27:03,912
- It stings?
- Yes so I shaved it.

1827
02:27:04,033 --> 02:27:08,185
- I have a present for her.
- Thanks. What's that?

1828
02:27:08,313 --> 02:27:12,909
- A doll, so you can play too.
- How nice!

1829
02:27:13,033 --> 02:27:17,265
- Did you pass through Rome?
- Yes, but didn't stop at home.

1830
02:27:19,113 --> 02:27:22,310
- What are those pictures?
- My patients made them.

1831
02:27:22,433 --> 02:27:24,189
I'm organising an exposition.

1832
02:27:24,569 --> 02:27:26,527
- Are you?
- Yes.

1833
02:27:29,633 --> 02:27:33,023
Did you know that mom
went to help Luigi,

1834
02:27:33,153 --> 02:27:36,828
- my colleague on the chair?
- Yes, I knew it.

1835
02:27:43,793 --> 02:27:47,183
- Who's that?
- My master, Franco Basaglia.

1836
02:27:48,633 --> 02:27:50,532
The one who wants
to set all the nuts free?

1837
02:27:50,533 --> 02:27:52,547
He has this strange feeling

1838
02:27:52,548 --> 02:27:55,675
that mentally ill people aren't
prisoners but human beings,

1839
02:27:55,874 --> 02:27:59,622
and that mental illness isn't
a crime to pay for. Weird guy, isn't he?

1840
02:28:04,793 --> 02:28:09,662
- How is dad?
- You should go see him.

1841
02:28:09,793 --> 02:28:11,784
I will.

1842
02:28:11,913 --> 02:28:13,824
I will.

1843
02:28:16,193 --> 02:28:18,423
I already made up my mind.

1844
02:28:20,953 --> 02:28:24,662
- Let's go see Giorgia.
- Sure. How is she?

1845
02:28:25,633 --> 02:28:27,749
Better.

1846
02:28:28,353 --> 02:28:33,632
Maybe we'll discharge her.
We do it as soon as possible,

1847
02:28:33,753 --> 02:28:36,790
and place them in small houses.

1848
02:28:36,913 --> 02:28:41,429
- What's wrong with them?
- Once they were all "schizophrenics"

1849
02:28:41,553 --> 02:28:46,308
- Which means nothing.
- It means they're like split in two..

1850
02:28:46,433 --> 02:28:50,984
Who isn't? Are you completely a
policeman? Am I completely a doctor?

1851
02:28:51,353 --> 02:28:53,127
The truth is we don't know
enough about the matter.

1852
02:28:53,265 --> 02:28:56,806
But one thing for sure they suffer
from the "mental hospital disease".

1853
02:28:56,906 --> 02:28:58,473
How do you cure them?

1854
02:28:58,753 --> 02:29:00,418
We open the departments.

1855
02:29:10,673 --> 02:29:14,507
- I'll wait in my study.
- You're leaving me?

1856
02:29:15,753 --> 02:29:19,905
- What can I tell her?
- Maybe she'll tell you something.

1857
02:29:39,153 --> 02:29:41,713
Hi Giorgia.

1858
02:29:49,353 --> 02:29:52,026
It's very good
to see you again.

1859
02:30:25,833 --> 02:30:28,142
Are you well?

1860
02:30:31,113 --> 02:30:34,742
You're right, it's
a stupid question.

1861
02:30:36,713 --> 02:30:38,669
What does it mean?

1862
02:30:41,233 --> 02:30:46,227
Nicola said you can go out.
Shall we go for an ice-cream?

1863
02:30:46,593 --> 02:30:49,983
We'll look for a juke-box too.

1864
02:30:50,953 --> 02:30:53,751
You used to like music.

1865
02:30:59,433 --> 02:31:02,231
I was also told you read.

1866
02:31:03,753 --> 02:31:06,221
You like books.

1867
02:31:08,113 --> 02:31:10,104
What do you read?

1868
02:31:14,073 --> 02:31:17,065
Which words can
reach your brain?

1869
02:31:26,353 --> 02:31:31,143
You can't hear me.
Sound! Air!

1870
02:31:31,313 --> 02:31:35,545
Attention! Nothing.
Nothing can reach you.

1871
02:31:36,393 --> 02:31:39,385
You're absent-minded.

1872
02:31:40,953 --> 02:31:42,944
Absent!

1873
02:31:45,793 --> 02:31:48,705
Like I didn't know already...

1874
02:31:55,033 --> 02:31:58,628
Do you remember that summer?

1875
02:32:01,593 --> 02:32:04,312
What were you like?

1876
02:32:07,753 --> 02:32:10,187
What was I like?

1877
02:32:25,393 --> 02:32:29,181
Madly mad Matteo...

1878
02:32:31,993 --> 02:32:33,824
Giorgia!

1879
02:32:38,713 --> 02:32:42,183
- Can she make it?
- She will, you'll see.

1880
02:32:43,393 --> 02:32:46,669
She reminded me...
Once, at that station...

1881
02:32:46,873 --> 02:32:51,663
- Yes?
- We listened to the juke-box.

1882
02:32:52,753 --> 02:32:57,190
- She turned around and looked at me.
- You were a bit in love with her...

1883
02:32:57,313 --> 02:33:01,101
- You were!
- We both were.

1884
02:33:01,473 --> 02:33:04,465
- What song was it?
- "A Chi" by Fausto Leali.

1885
02:33:05,673 --> 02:33:07,868
(singing) A chi!

1886
02:33:07,993 --> 02:33:12,623
A chi!

1887
02:33:15,913 --> 02:33:18,063
Nicola!

1888
02:33:34,473 --> 02:33:36,623
Your father...

1889
02:33:55,553 --> 02:33:58,431
Could you slow down?

1890
02:34:01,993 --> 02:34:05,133
Slow down, no one's after us.

1891
02:34:10,178 --> 02:34:11,343
You wanna drive?

1892
02:34:12,751 --> 02:34:15,556
- I just said to slow down.
- That's how I drive!

1893
02:34:17,033 --> 02:34:20,027
- Fuck off!
- Giulia, please...

1894
02:34:20,028 --> 02:34:22,352
I'm worried because
of Sara. Understand?

1895
02:34:23,353 --> 02:34:25,344
Understand?

1896
02:34:30,513 --> 02:34:33,311
Why don't you answer to her?

1897
02:34:34,073 --> 02:34:37,543
- She spoke to you!
- That's how I drive, Giulia.

1898
02:34:37,673 --> 02:34:41,905
Stop this fucking car!
Stop it!

1899
02:34:43,193 --> 02:34:45,866
Stop the car! Pull over!

1900
02:34:45,993 --> 02:34:49,702
Okay, calm down.
I'll stop it as soon as I can.

1901
02:34:57,873 --> 02:35:00,751
What the hell are you doing?

1902
02:35:02,793 --> 02:35:04,784
Turn around!

1903
02:35:06,593 --> 02:35:09,983
Turn around! Matteo!

1904
02:36:16,953 --> 02:36:19,513
Thanks for coming.

1905
02:36:19,833 --> 02:36:21,824
Hi.

1906
02:36:23,953 --> 02:36:25,784
Thanks.

1907
02:36:33,193 --> 02:36:37,903
- How's your mother?
- You can see it.

1908
02:36:41,033 --> 02:36:43,831
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Francesca.

1909
02:36:52,793 --> 02:36:56,991
- Policemen are busy.
- But he said he would come.

1910
02:36:57,113 --> 02:37:01,584
He will, if he can. But why
don't you come with me to Milan?

1911
02:37:02,473 --> 02:37:07,103
- Francesca can make it.
- No, I have to stay because of my job.

1912
02:37:07,233 --> 02:37:09,331
I know the school
will be ruined without you,

1913
02:37:09,568 --> 02:37:11,897
but you have to
take care of yourself.

1914
02:37:12,153 --> 02:37:15,225
In fact I do.
Working helps me.

1915
02:37:18,273 --> 02:37:21,310
- Giulia? Coffee?
- I'll go make some.

1916
02:37:21,433 --> 02:37:23,628
No, I will.

1917
02:37:25,753 --> 02:37:28,631
- Anyone wants a coffee?
- Yes thanks.

1918
02:37:34,433 --> 02:37:37,470
Francesca, where's
the coffee machine?

1919
02:37:37,593 --> 02:37:39,948
Into the cupboard.

1920
02:37:41,153 --> 02:37:43,065
The other one.

1921
02:37:48,605 --> 02:37:51,973
Nicola says you'll be
Minister of Treasure in 10 years.

1922
02:37:52,095 --> 02:37:53,570
Does he?

1923
02:37:53,993 --> 02:37:58,111
I'm currently working
for the Bank of Italy.

1924
02:37:58,233 --> 02:38:03,261
- To be a Minister I should change career.
- You mean?

1925
02:38:03,393 --> 02:38:07,527
It means Ministers are politicians.

1926
02:38:07,962 --> 02:38:09,587
I'm only a technician.

1927
02:38:10,153 --> 02:38:14,305
You're modest. Nicola says
you're smarter than him.

1928
02:38:14,433 --> 02:38:17,823
And if he says so...

1929
02:38:17,953 --> 02:38:20,945
- Nicola is crazier than his patients.
- That's true.

1930
02:38:21,153 --> 02:38:23,872
You're so clumsy!

1931
02:38:24,433 --> 02:38:27,106
- What are you doing?
- I've just finished high school.

1932
02:38:28,286 --> 02:38:31,875
I'll study Literature.

1933
02:38:31,876 --> 02:38:35,950
I want to be an archaeologist
and see the world too.

1934
02:38:36,318 --> 02:38:38,062
It's a good thing.

1935
02:38:38,769 --> 02:38:41,249
I am a middle-distance racer.

1936
02:38:41,808 --> 02:38:44,059
I'm an excellent cook
and play the violin too.

1937
02:38:44,211 --> 02:38:45,294
Nothing else?

1938
02:38:45,485 --> 02:38:50,552
- I get easily bored.
- Are you getting bored now?

1939
02:38:50,553 --> 02:38:53,705
No, I'm making coffee,
making sweets with Sara,

1940
02:38:53,795 --> 02:38:58,988
- and chatting with the Bank of Italy.
- Good.

1941
02:38:59,153 --> 02:39:00,932
It's something...

1942
02:39:07,273 --> 02:39:09,551
- Aunt?
- I'm coming.

1943
02:39:09,552 --> 02:39:11,153
See how many
cookies I've made!

1944
02:39:11,673 --> 02:39:16,085
You're so good...
Want some more kneading?

1945
02:39:16,901 --> 02:39:20,343
- Can I have a cookie?
- Carlo, go away!

1946
02:39:21,833 --> 02:39:27,066
Francesca is good
with children. I'm not.

1947
02:39:28,313 --> 02:39:33,498
- I'm not good.
- There isn't a single way to be a mother.

1948
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,871
I wasn't a good
mother to Matteo.

1949
02:39:37,033 --> 02:39:40,667
At least I wasn't
the mother he wanted.

1950
02:39:40,793 --> 02:39:44,786
No you were a great mother,
I can see it in Nicola.

1951
02:39:45,593 --> 02:39:47,584
Excuse me.

1952
02:39:49,993 --> 02:39:52,404
- I'll go get some milk.
- There's some in the fridge.

1953
02:39:53,309 --> 02:39:56,163
There are many
people. It's not enough.

1954
02:39:59,993 --> 02:40:03,276
- I'll go get some milk.
- I got it.

1955
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:06,441
Can I get out of
this house for a while?

1956
02:40:08,953 --> 02:40:10,466
I'm sorry.

1957
02:40:11,673 --> 02:40:14,904
I'm sorry love. Forgive me.

1958
02:40:38,633 --> 02:40:42,865
- You're late.
- There was trouble at home.

1959
02:40:42,993 --> 02:40:46,986
It's dangerous
for me to wait here.

1960
02:40:47,833 --> 02:40:51,269
I have a suitcase,
I have a suspicious air.

1961
02:40:51,393 --> 02:40:52,472
Have you got the keys?

1962
02:40:52,958 --> 02:40:55,897
They're inside, with the
money and the documents.

1963
02:40:56,113 --> 02:40:59,549
And the gun. Can you use it?

1964
02:41:00,353 --> 02:41:02,947
- No.
- You'll learn.

1965
02:42:40,033 --> 02:42:43,309
Let me pass! Let me pass!

1966
02:42:43,793 --> 02:42:47,024
Nicola, let me pass!

1967
02:42:49,713 --> 02:42:51,988
Let me pass!

1968
02:42:54,713 --> 02:42:58,308
- Let me pass!
- Did you think of your daughter?

1969
02:42:59,393 --> 02:43:01,668
Let me pass!

1970
02:43:02,353 --> 02:43:05,504
- Let me pass!
- Why?

1971
02:43:19,073 --> 02:43:21,348
Let me pass!

1972
02:43:23,113 --> 02:43:25,263
Let me pass!

1973
02:44:03,313 --> 02:44:08,307
(Tv) "The group was accused
of being an armed band..."

1974
02:44:08,513 --> 02:44:13,507
"...with a paramilitary structure
and possession of firearms."

1975
02:44:13,953 --> 02:44:18,344
(Tv) "The DIGOS of Turin released
the identikit of five people..."

1976
02:44:18,473 --> 02:44:22,466
"...3 men and 2 women who
frequented the Red Brigades hideout..."

1977
02:44:22,593 --> 02:44:25,983
"...which was found in Turin,
in "Corso Bernardino Telesio".

1978
02:44:26,153 --> 02:44:29,941
(Tv) "One of the suspects
refused to answer..."

1979
02:44:30,073 --> 02:44:32,633
"...to the magistrates."

1980

(Tv) "The defendants are
accused of trying to destroy..."

1981
02:44:38,633 --> 02:44:42,421
"...the State and its Institutions."

1982
02:44:42,753 --> 02:44:46,905
<i>I want more.</i>

1983
02:44:48,033 --> 02:44:53,391
Give me another piece of gazelle.

1984
02:44:53,633 --> 02:44:59,105
Sure, my little lion. Dad's
going to give it to you.

1985
02:45:07,113 --> 02:45:09,752
I want to quit fencing.

1986
02:45:14,033 --> 02:45:17,628
- I want to stop taking fencing lessons.
- What?

1987
02:45:17,753 --> 02:45:20,984
You asked me to, now you will!

1988
02:45:40,433 --> 02:45:45,223
- Where's mommy?
- Mom left. She left.

1989
02:45:51,353 --> 02:45:53,423
Sorry Sara.

1990
02:45:55,073 --> 02:45:57,348
I made a mistake.

1991
02:45:59,353 --> 02:46:01,708
Sara, please!

1992
02:46:02,633 --> 02:46:05,193
Let's make up.

1993
02:46:11,713 --> 02:46:17,250
<i>Salute! One! Two! Three!
Four! Five! Six!</i>

1994
02:46:17,463 --> 02:46:19,540
<i>Down! On guard!</i>

1995
02:46:21,193 --> 02:46:24,185
<i>One step forward!
One step back!</i>

1996
02:46:24,713 --> 02:46:27,864
<i>Knee-bend! On guard!</i>

1997
02:46:28,673 --> 02:46:31,870
<i>One step forward!
One step back!</i>

1998
02:46:33,993 --> 02:46:37,747
<i>Today you're
a little uncoordinated.</i>

1999
02:46:37,873 --> 02:46:43,425
Let's start over.
Arm in line. Look at me!

2000
02:46:43,553 --> 02:46:47,671
Arm in line! Position one!
Salute, away!

2001
02:46:47,793 --> 02:46:53,504
<i>One! Two! Three! Four!
Five! Six! Down! On guard!</i>

2002
02:46:54,543 --> 02:47:00,016
SPRING OF 1980

2003
02:47:01,653 --> 02:47:04,406
Will you, Tommaso...

2004
02:47:05,493 --> 02:47:08,690
- ...Carlo.
- Sorry?

2005
02:47:08,813 --> 02:47:11,930
Carlo Tommasi, not Tommaso Carli.

2006
02:47:12,053 --> 02:47:16,888
- Sorry. Will you, Carlo Carati...
- No, Carlo Tommasi.

2007
02:47:17,013 --> 02:47:21,325
- And Francesca Carati.
- There's also a male Carati.

2008
02:47:21,453 --> 02:47:26,607
It's me. I'm Nicola Carati, brother
of the bride Francesca Carati.

2009
02:47:26,733 --> 02:47:29,805
You are... sorry.

2010
02:47:29,933 --> 02:47:33,369
You're the brother of
the bride. Congratulations!

2011
02:47:33,493 --> 02:47:38,692
Then you should sit
where that crested girl is.

2012
02:47:39,493 --> 02:47:43,771
- In fact...
- I'm the best man. Carlo's my friend.

2013
02:47:43,893 --> 02:47:48,569
You're the best man
and SISTER of the bride!

2014
02:47:50,733 --> 02:47:54,806
- It's a coincidence.
- It's not illegal.

2015
02:47:56,853 --> 02:47:58,571
Let's start again.

2016
02:47:58,693 --> 02:48:03,403
Will you, Carlo Tommasi, marry...

2017
02:48:03,533 --> 02:48:08,448
Francesca Carati?

2018
02:48:09,773 --> 02:48:11,365
I will.

2019
02:48:11,493 --> 02:48:14,007
That's a good start!

2020
02:48:15,733 --> 02:48:20,727
Will you, Francesca Carati, marry...

2021
02:48:20,853 --> 02:48:24,482
- Carlo Tommasi?
- I will.

2022
02:48:26,773 --> 02:48:29,606
Will you exchange the rings?

2023
02:48:30,493 --> 02:48:34,452
- Careful...
- Sorry, it's my first marriage!

2024
02:48:35,133 --> 02:48:36,300
Mine too!

2025
02:49:24,573 --> 02:49:27,041
Long live the married couple!

2026
02:49:27,173 --> 02:49:29,129
Hurray!

2027
02:49:42,893 --> 02:49:45,885
Come to meet my girlfriends.

2028
02:49:46,013 --> 02:49:50,131
- No, Francesca!
- Only five minutes!

2029
02:49:52,453 --> 02:49:55,968
- They love blue eyes!
- Not again!

2030
02:49:56,093 --> 02:49:58,243
My brother Matteo.

2031
02:49:58,373 --> 02:50:01,683
Carlotta, Teresa...

2032
02:50:08,633 --> 02:50:10,425
Let me show you something...

2033
02:50:18,093 --> 02:50:20,394
- Sara!
- My niece Sara.

2034
02:50:20,774 --> 02:50:22,346
Give me a kiss.

2035
02:50:35,213 --> 02:50:38,205
It's a nice wedding.

2036
02:50:40,133 --> 02:50:44,046
- When will you get married?
- Who would ever want me?

2037
02:50:44,173 --> 02:50:48,485
You're a good catch!
Department of special bodywork!

2038
02:50:48,613 --> 02:50:53,209
- Working aristocracy!
- I was a good catch.

2039
02:50:53,973 --> 02:50:58,603
- What do you mean?
- I received this.

2040
02:51:10,453 --> 02:51:15,208
- You're fired?
- Almost: redundancy at zero hours.

2041
02:51:15,333 --> 02:51:18,405
- They sent 23,000 letters like this one.
- There's nothing you can do?

2042
02:51:18,533 --> 02:51:23,129
- We've been on strike for a month.
- You said you'd be safe.

2043
02:51:23,253 --> 02:51:28,407
Let's talk about it later.
It's Carlo's wedding.

2044
02:51:32,613 --> 02:51:34,604
Read this.

2045
02:51:49,013 --> 02:51:52,801
Do you study such things
at the Bank of Italy?

2046
02:51:52,933 --> 02:51:57,105
- More or less.
- So? What does it mean?

2047
02:51:59,613 --> 02:52:02,207
The FIAT is indebted
for 7,000 billion lire.

2048
02:52:02,333 --> 02:52:07,691
Other factories are in a worse
situation. They don't produce enough.

2049
02:52:07,813 --> 02:52:11,488
- They're not competitive.
- Then what?

2050
02:52:11,613 --> 02:52:16,323
- Workers can't win.
- It's his opinion.

2051
02:52:16,453 --> 02:52:20,731
- It isn't, unfortunately.
- But there are the Unions!

2052
02:52:22,977 --> 02:52:27,406
They can't do anything.
People are scared, selfish.

2053
02:52:27,533 --> 02:52:31,651
Carlo, they can't
fire him like in 1800!

2054
02:52:31,773 --> 02:52:36,893
Industries are
being re-organised.

2055
02:52:37,013 --> 02:52:42,212
They cut the expenses
to become competitive.

2056
02:52:42,333 --> 02:52:44,906
- Who cares!
- I know.

2057
02:52:44,907 --> 02:52:47,332
Should we pay
for their incapacity?

2058
02:52:47,419 --> 02:52:52,603
- Who cares if the system blows up?
- Come on, the system won't blow up.

2059
02:52:52,813 --> 02:52:57,091
If it did, it should be replaced
by something else. Any idea?

2060
02:52:57,213 --> 02:52:59,966
Me? You're the expert!

2061
02:53:00,093 --> 02:53:05,804
Enough with fighting!
This is a happy day!

2062
02:53:06,613 --> 02:53:08,016
Cut it out.

2063
02:53:13,493 --> 02:53:16,565
It's the "swan-song" of workers!

2064
02:53:16,693 --> 02:53:20,481
In a few years no one will remember us.

2065
02:53:20,613 --> 02:53:24,811
Don't worry doctor,
they won't have me!

2066
02:53:24,933 --> 02:53:30,565
I won't stay at home and cry.
I'll look for another job.

2067
02:53:30,693 --> 02:53:35,847
If I can't find it I'll invent one.
I can mend water taps, TVs, heaters.

2068
02:53:35,973 --> 02:53:39,443
Houses are full of so much stuff!

2069
02:53:39,573 --> 02:53:44,966
- Someone has to mend it! I will.
- Good!

2070
02:53:46,133 --> 02:53:50,126
At least I'll go live with him,
I'll wear a Napoleon's hat

2071
02:53:50,253 --> 02:53:52,892
and dance the tango!

2072
02:53:54,173 --> 02:53:58,246
I want to dance!
Let's go!

2073
02:53:58,493 --> 02:54:01,724
Come on, sissies!

2074
02:54:02,693 --> 02:54:04,684
Let's go to dance!

2075
02:54:09,173 --> 02:54:11,846
- Do you know "Anatomy"?
- What?

2076
02:54:11,973 --> 02:54:14,246
(singing) Anatomy!
- "Amado Mio"!

2077
02:54:14,247 --> 02:54:15,586
That one!

2078
02:54:21,933 --> 02:54:25,528
Mrs. Tommasi,
may I have this dance?

2079
02:54:34,453 --> 02:54:36,728
Be careful with my mother!

2080
02:54:37,541 --> 02:54:39,232
# Fixed and translated: lyliakar #

2081
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:42,467

<i>He wants to be an acrobat.</i>

2084
02:55:35,373 --> 02:55:37,449
TURIN, SUMMER OF 1982

2085
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:41,997
<i>He puts his hands on the
ground, springs up and "zac!"</i>

2086
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:47,554
He puts his feet against the wall
then he starts swinging them.

2087
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:52,472
When I meet him I say
"Hello Mimmo"...

2088
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:56,150
...and we shake feet.

2089
02:55:56,360 --> 02:56:00,797
- Balloons!
- I'll buy you one.

2090
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:03,477
- What colour?
- Blue.

2091
02:56:03,478 --> 02:56:05,039
Yes, it's your favourite...

2092
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:09,956
Hello. A blue balloon please.

2093
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:14,199
- Are you happy that school is over?
- No.

2094
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:16,914
Why? It's holiday time!

2095
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:19,687
Where would
you like to go this year?

2096
02:56:19,688 --> 02:56:22,035
When will mom come back?

2097
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:24,756
I don't know Sara.

2098
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:28,953
Monica said dads
say that when moms die.

2099
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:32,709
That's nonsense.
You believe Monica?

2100
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:37,311
- If mom died would you tell me?
- Of course.

2101
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:49,594
- Why did you set it free?
- If you told a lie, that was for mom.

2102

- Your neighbour.</i>

2116

<i>- I need a favour please.
- Just a moment.</i>

2117
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:28,239
- I'm sorry, I thought the Randis were in.
- No, they're out of town.

2118
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:31,008
- I'm their guest.
- Are you a teacher too?

2119
02:59:31,009 --> 02:59:31,851
Yes.

2120
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:36,189
I came here from
Udine for the exams.

2121
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:41,311
My husband forgot the milk.
Do you have some?

2122
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:44,935
The fridge is empty sorry,
I had no time to fill it up yet.

2123
02:59:44,936 --> 02:59:48,350
Never mind. I'll send
him to buy some.

2124
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:50,746
As they say, "a forgetful head
makes a weary pair of heels".

2125
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:53,832
- Welcome, by the way.
- Thanks.

2126
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,070
Sara get inside!

2127
02:59:59,560 --> 03:00:04,350
- Her name's Sara too?
- Like your daughter?

2128
03:00:04,560 --> 03:00:07,791
No, like my niece.

2129
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,879
- Is she a pest too?
- No... Yes!

2130
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:13,195
No.

2131
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:24,031
<i>It was "Silver"!</i>

03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:36,070
"I stayed there, shaking..."

2135
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:39,989
"listening!"

2136
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:22,911
<i>She passed by in the morning.</i>

2137
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:28,160
About 7 a.m., no one
was here but me.

2138
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:34,474
She came out of nowhere.
Who told her I work here?

2139
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:41,273
You don't want
to know how she is?

2140
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:44,552
I don't want
to know anything.

2141
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:48,005
I didn't recognise her at first,
her hair's black now and...

2142
03:01:48,006 --> 03:01:49,684
Enough.

2143
03:01:54,080 --> 03:01:57,072
She wants to see her child.

2144
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:04,680
From a distance. She won't
speak or get close to her.

2145
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:06,267
Have a cigarette?

2146
03:02:06,625 --> 03:02:08,492
- Did you start smoking?
- No.

2147
03:02:09,440 --> 03:02:13,752
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing. You can't argue with her.

2148
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:16,952
She made the date and left.

2149
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:20,152
She didn't even ask how I am,

2150
03:02:20,360 --> 03:02:23,796
or why I'm a simple
manual worker now.

2151
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:28,596
- When is the date?
- In two days, during the "final".

2152
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:30,202
Which "final"?

2153
03:02:30,228 --> 03:02:34,207
The World Championship!
The soccer match!

2154
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:39,639
(radio) "Header."
- They're listening to the match.

2155
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:47,076
- Look, a hyena!
- "Hyena Ridens".

2156
03:02:47,280 --> 03:02:49,881
- They always laugh.
- Because they're witty?

2157
03:02:49,882 --> 03:02:51,826
No, they grind their teeth.

2158
03:02:51,827 --> 03:02:53,914
- A moose!
- Yes.

2159
03:02:54,120 --> 03:02:57,192
I've seen many in Norway.

2160
03:02:57,840 --> 03:03:02,391
- Look, a wild pig!
- No, it's a warthog.

2161
03:03:22,320 --> 03:03:24,470

the end of the World Championship."

2168
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:54,349
Those are birds.
That's a hawk.

2169
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:58,792
They were used to hunt,
they picked up preys.

2170
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:04,394
It looks like a hen house.

2171
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:08,149
- A pelican!
- A moose, look!

2172
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:11,557
...and a giraffe, my favourite.

2173
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:16,788
- Why is that?
- They stretch their neck to eat,

2174
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,070
and look at the sky.

2175
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:23,671
I like animals
which look at the sky.

2176
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:41,678
- What's that?
- That's a sea cow.

2177
03:04:41,880 --> 03:04:47,159
- It looks like a seal.
- Yes, but it's a sea cow.

2178
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:52,718
- How come you know so much?
- I'm reading the plates.

2179

03:05:15,280 --> 03:05:18,670
Yes!

2185
03:05:24,400 --> 03:05:26,755
We won.

2186
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:30,674
Yes, we won.

2187
03:05:34,316 --> 03:05:37,780
AUTUMN 1983

2188
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:43,115
What a cold!

2189
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:48,189
Rome was supposed
to be sunny all the time!

2190
03:05:48,400 --> 03:05:54,032
You don't have a motorbike, do you?
I don't want confusion in the yard.

2191
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:59,109
That's the kitchen
and this is the living-room.

2192
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:01,788
It's bright.

2193
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,549
The furniture is new.

2194
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:10,117
There's the bedroom.

2195
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:16,151
- It's perfect.
- The TV is new as well.

2196
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:20,990
The removal company men
walked up to the fourth floor.

2197
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:26,023
- I gave them a 20,000 lire tip.
- Sure. Here you are.

2198
03:06:26,024 --> 03:06:29,309
You can give it to me
at the end of the week.

2199
03:06:29,310 --> 03:06:30,483
Alright.

2200
03:06:30,484 --> 03:06:34,555
The owner of the house
wants her flowers

2201
03:06:34,600 --> 03:06:39,879
- to be watered every day.
- It's fine.

2202
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:44,835
- I can do that if you want.
- No, I'll do that.

2203
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:49,628
If you need anything,
please call me or my husband.

2204
03:06:49,629 --> 03:06:52,793
- We're in the porter's lodge.
- Okay.

2205
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:57,875
- Have a nice day. Here's the key.
- See you.

2206
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:19,193
All's well, Madam Marquise!

2207
03:08:05,320 --> 03:08:07,311
Let's go, colleague.

2208
03:08:08,960 --> 03:08:10,951
This way.

2209
03:08:12,080 --> 03:08:13,877
Hi.

2210
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:18,198
The nightshift starts
tomorrow. It lasts 2 weeks,

2211
03:08:18,400 --> 03:08:21,392
then we have 3 days off.

2212
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:31,072
Then the dayshift starts.
This is the Chief's office.

2213
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:34,031
Pay attention.

2214
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:39,314
That's your office and
here's the coffee machine.

2215
03:08:47,720 --> 03:08:50,518
This is your desk.

2216
03:08:57,760 --> 03:09:02,993
Those are wanted,
no political distinction.

2217
03:09:03,200 --> 03:09:07,079
We think they're all in town.

2218
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:15,591
What if we meet
this one for example?

2219
03:09:15,800 --> 03:09:19,156
If she tries to reach
her pocket we'll shoot.

2220
03:09:19,360 --> 03:09:23,558
I'll shoot her even
if she stays still.

2221
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:25,876
Just for precaution.

2222
03:09:30,160 --> 03:09:33,630
(Tv) "The car has been
found near there."

2223
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:37,435
"It was stolen 10 days ago."

2224
03:09:37,640 --> 03:09:42,555
- It's sticky!
- Add some more flour to it.

2225
03:09:42,760 --> 03:09:48,118
(Tv) "His 20 year old daughter
has heard the shooting."

2226
03:09:48,320 --> 03:09:53,917
"The attorney has died
before reaching the hospital.

2227
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:56,839
It's full of bubbles.

2228
03:09:57,040 --> 03:10:00,112
(Tv) "A man has called saying"

2229
03:10:00,320 --> 03:10:03,915
"the Red Brigades
forced him to call."

2230
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:09,240
"...A new claim for
the terrorist attack..."

2231
03:10:09,440 --> 03:10:14,116
"Caccia was investigating
terrorism, traffic in drugs..."

2232
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:19,075
"...and the mafia racket..."

2233
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:42,515
I'd like to borrow this.

2234
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:44,711
Hello.

2235
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:49,511
Yes?

2236
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:53,350
You're Nicola.

2237
03:10:54,800 --> 03:10:57,917
- The girl from Stromboli!
- I have a name.

2238
03:10:58,120 --> 03:11:02,033
Wait, don't tell me!

2239
03:11:02,240 --> 03:11:05,869
Give me a document
in the meantime.

2240
03:11:07,840 --> 03:11:11,037
I forgot it. Marcella!

2241
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:15,556
- No, Mirella.
- True!

2242
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:16,761
Sorry.

2243
03:11:16,939 --> 03:11:20,893
I'll record it using my name,
but bring it back in 15 days.

2244
03:11:20,960 --> 03:11:24,111
- What if I steal it?
- I'll look for you.

2245
03:11:24,320 --> 03:11:26,579
You don't know where
I live, or my last name...

2246
03:11:26,802 --> 03:11:29,755
I'll find you a second time.

2247
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:32,071
Okay.

2248
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:38,231
Did you come here
because we spoke about it?

2249
03:11:40,480 --> 03:11:43,472
Your advice was good,
it's a beautiful place.

2250
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:48,155
It's lunch break. Wanna share
a sandwich and an apple?

2251
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:53,718
I remember that day so clearly.
I even dream of you very often.

2252
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:59,911
I told my boyfriend
and he got jealous.

2253
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:04,955
I don't know why, I was
no longer sure you were real!

2254
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:08,311
- Men are idiots.
- That's true.

2255
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:13,835
Then if you tell him
you met me he'll kill you!

2256
03:12:15,480 --> 03:12:18,916
He's that sort of man,
yes, that's why I left him.

2257
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,430
Apple?

2258
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:28,950
Do you still take pictures?

2259
03:12:29,560 --> 03:12:31,516
Sometimes.

2260
03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:36,953
Remember when you told me
I had to look for mystery?

2261
03:12:37,160 --> 03:12:39,628
I liked that a lot.

2262
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:43,833
I tried, but never managed it.

2263
03:12:44,040 --> 03:12:48,158
I can't photograph people inside.

2264
03:12:51,560 --> 03:12:53,755
You said that!

2265
03:12:54,880 --> 03:12:57,155
Did I? I don't remember.

2266
03:12:58,160 --> 03:13:00,355
- Don't you?
- I don't.

2267
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:05,876
You changed my life
and you don't remember...

2268
03:13:06,060 --> 03:13:07,369
Apple, please...

2269
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:15,795
I'll forgive you only
cause you're handsome.

2270
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:23,278
Please don't keep the book
for more than 2 weeks.

2271
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:07,873
Giovanna! Come in!

2272
03:14:09,440 --> 03:14:11,749
Let's go to the living-room...

2273
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:16,876
- How did you know I was here?
- I read the list of...

2274
03:14:17,080 --> 03:14:20,072
...those assigned to the escorts.

2275
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:24,558
- You left no address.
- Sit down.

2276
03:14:24,760 --> 03:14:30,517
- I didn't know you were in Rome.
- I'm staying at mom's for a while.

2277
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:35,510
- There's lots of room there...
- How's she?

2278
03:14:35,720 --> 03:14:40,523
- Have a guess?
- Something to drink?

2279
03:14:40,524 --> 03:14:45,391
Do you think it's normal for you
to come here and not call her?

2280
03:14:45,655 --> 03:14:46,792
I'll make some coffee.

2281
03:14:46,892 --> 03:14:50,702
- I'm speaking to you.
- You're speaking like an elder sister!

2282
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:55,397
- I already have a mother!
- To you it's as if she's dead!

2283
03:14:55,600 --> 03:14:58,160
How do you know?

2284
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:03,159
You can only judge me!
We're not in the Court!

2285
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:06,511
But what did we do to you?

2286
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:14,512
Giovanna, wait! Giovanna!

2287
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:19,751
Listen...

2288
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,195
- Hi.
- Hi.

2289
03:17:28,400 --> 03:17:31,631
- What's your name?
- Matteo.

2290
03:17:31,840 --> 03:17:35,230
It's a beautiful name.

2291
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:38,034
- What's yours?
- Lolita.

2292
03:17:38,240 --> 03:17:41,357
- Where are you from?
- Venezuela.

2293
03:17:57,600 --> 03:18:00,034
What's wrong? Are you sad?

2294
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:06,870
What are you looking at?

2295
03:18:07,080 --> 03:18:09,833
- Your necklace.
- My necklace?

2296
03:18:10,760 --> 03:18:12,876
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

2297
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:20,755
Here you are. For your girl.

2298
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:30,272
I don't feel like I'm ready.

2299
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:34,715
Maybe I...

2300
03:18:36,040 --> 03:18:40,397
My companions
are stronger than me.

2301
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:45,754
I'm always scared,
maybe I'm not trained enough.

2302
03:18:46,600 --> 03:18:48,955
Maybe I should...

2303
03:18:51,240 --> 03:18:53,595
You don't have to be scared.

2304
03:18:55,320 --> 03:18:57,595
You'll make it.

2305
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:13,751
Hello?

2306
03:19:15,320 --> 03:19:18,118
Hello.

2307
03:19:18,320 --> 03:19:21,949
- Francesca, listen to me.
- Yes.

2308
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:24,151
I need to see you at once.

2309
03:19:24,320 --> 03:19:29,838
- At the Foro Romano in two hours.
- Okay.

2310
03:19:37,320 --> 03:19:42,110
Sara grew bigger. I wish I could
bring you a picture, but I was in a haste.

2311
03:19:42,320 --> 03:19:44,311
I was so nervous!

2312
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:51,233
A few days ago Nicola took
her to watch "The Party".

2313
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:55,964
Suddenly she asked him what
"a girl's period" is, in a loud voice.

2314
03:19:55,965 --> 03:19:57,194
And what did he do?

2315
03:19:57,295 --> 03:20:00,572
He explained it to her
in front of everyone.

2316
03:20:00,573 --> 03:20:02,829
Nicola cannot
see differences.

2317
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:08,034
Young, old, crazy, sane
are all the same to him. Listen,

2318
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:19,515
tell Carlo to ask for a transfer.
He must leave Italy.

2319
03:20:19,720 --> 03:20:22,712
Now.

2320
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:32,356
- And go where?
- Wherever you want.

2321
03:20:33,400 --> 03:20:35,516
He's in danger.

2322
03:20:37,080 --> 03:20:40,231
The kids are small...

2323
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:43,034
...and there's the house, and his job...

2324
03:20:43,240 --> 03:20:46,516
And I know him, he'll never leave.

2325
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:49,436
- I have to go now.
- Wait!

2326
03:20:49,640 --> 03:20:52,234
Now you listen to me.

2327
03:20:52,440 --> 03:20:57,036
I'll try to speak to
Carlo and convince him,

2328
03:20:57,240 --> 03:20:59,674
but he'll say no.

2329
03:20:59,880 --> 03:21:04,829
He is your friend before being the father
of my children. You must do something.

2330
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:10,558
- I can't.
- Tell them he's never alone.

2331
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:16,551
Tell them it's too risky
for them to kill him. Save him!

2332
03:21:18,520 --> 03:21:20,511
Swear it!

2333
03:21:22,080 --> 03:21:24,435
You trust me?

2334
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:27,989
I do.

2335
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:33,996
Alright, I'll do my best.

2336
03:21:37,560 --> 03:21:42,634
- Is Nicola coming for the holidays?
- I think so.

2337
03:21:42,840 --> 03:21:46,435
- On New Year's Eve.
- I want to see Sara.

2338
03:21:46,640 --> 03:21:49,632
- Only once.
- What should I do?

2339
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:54,959
- Take her to the Coliseum. I'll call you.
- Okay.

2340
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:59,754
- Don't tell anyone.
- I won't.

2341
03:22:16,240 --> 03:22:18,231
What's your job?

2342
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:20,811
I'm an engineer.

2343
03:22:21,965 --> 03:22:25,687
Every mother dreams
of having an engineer for a son!

2344
03:22:25,720 --> 03:22:28,712
Maybe that's why I became one.

2345
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:33,436
So you make dams, bridges, buildings...

2346
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:37,633
I often work abroad. I travel much.

2347
03:22:37,840 --> 03:22:41,037
- Do you like to travel?
- No.

2348
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:45,993
- What would you like to do?
- I don't know.

2349
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:51,834
- Maybe stay among books like you.
- Then come with me!

2350
03:22:54,400 --> 03:22:56,730
- Do you like chestnuts?
- Yes.

2351
03:22:57,046 --> 03:22:58,201
Chestnuts please.

2352
03:22:59,560 --> 03:23:00,768
- How much is it?
- 3,000.

2353
03:23:00,873 --> 03:23:02,116
That's a theft!

2354
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:06,230
- You can go pick them up then!
- That's Rome...

2355
03:23:07,360 --> 03:23:09,874
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

2356
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:14,597
- Wanna come to a place?
- Where?

2357
03:23:17,960 --> 03:23:22,795
Fingers here and thumb
behind, lift up your hand...

2358
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:25,798
...swing your arm...

2359
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:30,278
...and place your
left foot forwards.

2360
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,958
- It's easy.
- So and so.

2361
03:23:39,880 --> 03:23:41,950
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

2362
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:54,475
- Put your fingers in the holes!
- No, I'll do as I prefer.

2363
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:56,352
Enough said.

2364
03:23:56,560 --> 03:24:01,873
- But it won't go straightforward.
- Wait and you'll see.

2365
03:24:06,880 --> 03:24:09,235
- It's weak.
- Shut up.

2366
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:15,031
Goal!

2367
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:19,193
- It's called "strike".
- Strike!

2368
03:24:34,360 --> 03:24:35,923
- Get on.
- Thanks.

2369
03:24:35,924 --> 03:24:38,509
- You're all wet, sorry.
- Never mind.

2370
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:42,348
- I'll make a phone call.
- Okay.

2371
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:10,278
- You're all wet!
- I must leave tomorrow, sorry.

2372
03:26:10,480 --> 03:26:14,473
- There are problems at work.
- How long will you stay away?

2373
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:17,752
A week. I'll be back on the 7th.

2374
03:26:19,400 --> 03:26:22,039
What will you do on the 7th?

2375
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:25,276
I'll come and pick you.

2376
03:26:26,800 --> 03:26:28,791
What time?

2377
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:34,432
When the library closes.

2378
03:26:35,720 --> 03:26:38,712
I found it under the seat.

2379
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:44,999
I bought it the other day but I lost it.

2380
03:26:45,200 --> 03:26:50,115
- Who knows how it ended there.
- Is it for your girlfriend?

2381
03:26:54,120 --> 03:26:56,111
It's for you.

2382
03:26:58,920 --> 03:27:01,115
Then help me wear it.

2383
03:29:13,720 --> 03:29:16,029
I'll do your shift.

2384
03:29:19,120 --> 03:29:22,669
- Afternoon and evening?
- Yes.

2385
03:29:29,240 --> 03:29:31,231
You're a good friend!

2386
03:30:38,240 --> 03:30:42,313
I'm not sure this car could
have made it on the highway.

2387
03:30:42,520 --> 03:30:45,076
- Hey now!
- When will you change it?

2388
03:30:45,856 --> 03:30:48,230
Why should I? It's perfect!

2389
03:30:48,439 --> 03:30:53,551
- It's old and it sucks.
- No, it's beautiful and perfect.

2390
03:30:53,760 --> 03:30:59,437
- Why don't you buy a new one?
- My child's a consumerist...

2391
03:30:59,640 --> 03:31:02,996
- Are we poor?
- Why? Do you miss anything?

2392
03:31:09,080 --> 03:31:13,790
I wish we left for Christmas.
We'd have exchanged presents.

2393
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:18,357
- We will on New Year's Eve.
- Who's coming?

2394
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:22,440
- Granny, aunt Giovanna...
- Francesca?

2395
03:31:22,441 --> 03:31:23,799
Aunt Francesca,
Carlo, the kids...

2396
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:27,793
- They had another kid.
- What's his name?

2397
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:32,511
- Asdrubale Teofrasto Callimaco.
- Callimaco?

2398
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:37,236
- No, Nabuccodonosor.
- You're making fun of me!

2399
03:31:37,440 --> 03:31:40,750
- His name's Michele.
- Michele?

2400
03:31:41,600 --> 03:31:46,549
"The journey started well.
The ship was good..."

2401
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:50,355
"...to cross the Ocean."

2402
03:31:50,560 --> 03:31:53,836
"The crew was good too..."

2403
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:58,073
"...and the Captain was skilled."

2404
03:31:58,280 --> 03:32:01,477
"Everything was going well."

2405
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:07,232
"Then, one night Gino
was getting to his cabin..."

2406
03:32:07,440 --> 03:32:12,275
- "and he suddenly felt hungry."
- Let's not show ourselves.

2407
03:32:12,480 --> 03:32:15,677
- Look at them.
- Yes.

2408
03:32:16,560 --> 03:32:21,315
- They won't sleep tonight.
- Who cares, they're happy.

2409
03:32:21,520 --> 03:32:22,498
You're right.

2410
03:32:22,547 --> 03:32:24,271
- Lucky you!
- Why?

2411
03:32:24,720 --> 03:32:26,684
- You have a daughter.
- And?

2412
03:32:27,463 --> 03:32:29,849
We're much
better than you all.

2413
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:35,358
- Stop it...
- If you had a son you'd be wilder.

2414
03:32:35,560 --> 03:32:40,554
- Really?
- Yes, but she tamed you.

2415
03:32:40,760 --> 03:32:45,470
- You have white hair!
- Only a couple!

2416
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:50,754
- You're a charming 40 year old man.
- I'm only 37!

2417
03:32:50,960 --> 03:32:53,315
But women like mature men...

2418
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:55,511
Lend me your finger...

2419
03:32:58,360 --> 03:33:01,716
How can you make it with 3 kids?
One's already too much for me...

2420
03:33:01,920 --> 03:33:04,514
I'm devastated but I love it.

2421
03:33:22,400 --> 03:33:26,632
Why is Carlo escorted?

2422
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:28,990
These are hard times.

2423
03:33:37,240 --> 03:33:40,232
- Nicola?
- Yes?

2424
03:33:43,600 --> 03:33:48,196
Nothing. Michele woke up.
Can you open the door?

2425
03:33:54,800 --> 03:33:57,030
Why are you escorted?

2426
03:33:59,560 --> 03:34:02,597
"It was the winter
of our discontent..."

2427
03:34:02,800 --> 03:34:07,078
- "The accountant climbed up the stairs."
- "I was forced to wait for him..."

2428
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:10,317
"There was also the crazy doctor!"

2429
03:34:11,400 --> 03:34:14,392
- How are you?
- Fine. Yourself?

2430
03:34:14,600 --> 03:34:19,754
I was thinking of places like
Denmark, Sweden or Holland.

2431
03:34:20,360 --> 03:34:25,798
Those countries look like glass boxes.
Citizens can look through them.

2432
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:33,639
I dream of transparent banks,

2433
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:36,558
and Stock Exchange.

2434
03:34:36,760 --> 03:34:40,958
This way politics and economics
would be transparent too.

2435
03:34:41,160 --> 03:34:44,914
Cute little thing...
Did he fall asleep?

2436
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:48,908
- Have a look?
- Not yet.

2437
03:34:49,120 --> 03:34:52,590
What's wrong tonight, honey?

2438
03:34:52,800 --> 03:34:58,636
He's too excited, we arrived,
he saw new faces...

2439
03:34:58,840 --> 03:35:02,071
- Give him to me.
- No, he's about to fall asleep.

2440
03:35:02,280 --> 03:35:06,193
- Is he sleeping?
- Careful.

2441
03:35:06,400 --> 03:35:08,436
Give him to me.

2442
03:35:08,640 --> 03:35:11,598
Mind the duck.

2443
03:35:15,520 --> 03:35:17,829
- Francesca?
- She's sleeping.

2444
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:22,556
She's exhausted.
Holidays are tiring for her.

2445
03:35:22,760 --> 03:35:25,593
As regards transparency...

2446
03:35:25,800 --> 03:35:30,954
- Do you think it's possible?
- Of course, in other countries it is.

2447
03:35:31,160 --> 03:35:35,870
But do you think
Italians like transparency?

2448
03:35:36,080 --> 03:35:39,072
I think it's an illusion.

2449
03:35:40,320 --> 03:35:44,438
- Shall we put him into his cradle?
- Yes.

2450
03:35:45,400 --> 03:35:48,472
Give him to me.

2451
03:35:49,360 --> 03:35:53,831
Don't whisper or
he won't fall asleep.

2452
03:35:54,040 --> 03:35:58,272
Kids like noise,
they're afraid of silence.

2453
03:36:01,920 --> 03:36:06,550
- He's sleeping.
- He'll wake up in half an hour.

2454
03:36:08,400 --> 03:36:11,597
Daddy's cute baby...

2455
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:14,591
How cute you are...

2456
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:20,310
You've always
been good with kids.

2457
03:36:22,760 --> 03:36:25,558
- Are you good with women too?
- Of course.

2458
03:36:25,760 --> 03:36:29,719
- Do you have anyone?
- Not a regular one.

2459
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:34,789
- Do you have many women?
- Are you jealous?

2460
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:36,991
I'll tell you a secret.

2461
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:41,671
I married your sister
to stay close to you.

2462
03:36:41,880 --> 03:36:47,193
Indeed you look like a "queer".

2463
03:36:48,080 --> 03:36:50,833
- You too.
- Of course!

2464
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:57,518
Who are your girlfriends?

2465
03:36:57,720 --> 03:37:01,030
You have a circle of
nurses and anaesthetists?

2466
03:37:01,240 --> 03:37:03,963
It's none of your business!

2467
03:37:03,964 --> 03:37:06,959
- Where do you see them?
- Outside.

2468
03:37:06,960 --> 03:37:09,952
- What about Sara?
- She doesn't know.

2469
03:37:11,560 --> 03:37:16,634
And none of them is somehow...

2470
03:37:16,840 --> 03:37:18,831
Of course.

2471
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:24,034
But after a while
everything's over.

2472
03:37:25,320 --> 03:37:28,312
You didn't answer before.

2473
03:37:29,360 --> 03:37:32,352
Why are you escorted?

2474
03:37:44,200 --> 03:37:47,988
- Did you speak with Francesca?
- No.

2475
03:37:50,840 --> 03:37:53,832
Want some whisky?

2476
03:37:58,080 --> 03:38:00,548
So?

2477
03:38:03,640 --> 03:38:08,430
Looks like I'm a target.
That's why I'm escorted.

2478
03:38:08,640 --> 03:38:13,191
- But why you?
- Not only judges are targets,

2479
03:38:13,400 --> 03:38:15,868
or politicians and policemen.

2480
03:38:16,080 --> 03:38:20,232
The other day one of my
university fellow-students was shot.

2481
03:38:20,440 --> 03:38:25,514
They say "Hit one to educate 100"
They want to educate us!

2482
03:38:25,720 --> 03:38:30,748
- They want to terrify us.
- And so you're forced to live in an armour?

2483
03:38:30,960 --> 03:38:35,238
- Any suggestions?
- Ask for a transfer abroad.

2484
03:38:37,160 --> 03:38:40,731
The Governor wanted
to send me to New York.

2485
03:38:41,982 --> 03:38:43,216
And?

2486
03:38:45,440 --> 03:38:49,035
Drink that whisky
and tell me if you like it.

2487
03:38:49,240 --> 03:38:53,438
- Why didn't you accept?
- If we all leave

2488
03:38:53,640 --> 03:38:56,154
they'll win.

2489
03:39:01,280 --> 03:39:03,874
How did you find out you're a target?

2490
03:39:05,280 --> 03:39:07,919
Giulia met Francesca.

2491
03:39:08,880 --> 03:39:11,599
Giulia contacted us.

2492
03:39:12,880 --> 03:39:16,236
She also said she wants to see the kid.

2493
03:39:49,504 --> 03:39:54,102
31st DECEMBER 1983

2494
03:40:04,600 --> 03:40:06,184
There's no room here.

2495
03:40:06,493 --> 03:40:08,532
I'll let Francesca get off
then I'll follow you.

2496
03:40:08,533 --> 03:40:09,834
Okay.

2497
03:40:18,080 --> 03:40:22,198
- He's worked for me for a week.
- Six months ago another man

2498
03:40:22,400 --> 03:40:26,996
who was carrying cocaine
was arrested in your nightclub.

2499
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:31,034
He was a customer. I'm clean.

2500
03:40:31,240 --> 03:40:37,076
I just care for them
to be wearing a jacket.

2501
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:43,116
- He was arrested three times before.
- I don't check criminal records.

2502
03:40:43,320 --> 03:40:47,154
I respect my workers' privacy.

2503
03:40:51,960 --> 03:40:56,317
Nothing to say, Azi Mohamed?

2504
03:41:07,960 --> 03:41:09,951
No.

2505
03:41:14,440 --> 03:41:19,514
I'd like to go to my parents'
house. It's New Year's Eve.

2506
03:41:19,720 --> 03:41:22,359
I don't give a damn!

2507
03:41:23,240 --> 03:41:25,231
What?

2508
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:28,445
- Someone's looking for you.
- Who's that?

2509
03:41:28,446 --> 03:41:29,948
A certain Mirella.

2510
03:41:57,880 --> 03:42:01,668
- Why did you say your name's Nicola?
- What are you doing here?

2511
03:42:01,800 --> 03:42:06,032
Why didn't you say
your name's Matteo?

2512
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:11,478
- How did you find out?
- I asked some guy at the bowling.

2513
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:14,478
You go there often.

2514
03:42:14,960 --> 03:42:17,554
He said you're a policeman.

2515
03:42:17,586 --> 03:42:20,082
I should be the detective here,

2516
03:42:21,266 --> 03:42:23,520
while everyone
investigates me, instead.

2517
03:42:24,440 --> 03:42:29,594
You, my sister... Everyone
wants to mind my own business.

2518
03:42:30,480 --> 03:42:33,074
- What do you want?
- I wanted to see you.

2519
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:37,187
- I thought we were happy together.
- So what?

2520
03:42:37,399 --> 03:42:38,659
Nothing.

2521
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:42,511
- But...
- What?

2522
03:42:44,760 --> 03:42:46,751
What?

2523
03:42:46,960 --> 03:42:48,512
I'm busy.

2524
03:42:48,513 --> 03:42:51,421
- Why do you act like that?
- I'm on duty.

2525
03:42:52,480 --> 03:42:55,199
I don't understand.

2526
03:42:55,400 --> 03:42:59,791
Why did you lie to me?
You've always lied to me!

2527
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:04,994
- Why did you say your name's Nicola?
- I'll tell you, but not here.

2528
03:43:07,760 --> 03:43:12,550
- Fine. I'm leaving.
- Fine.

2529
03:43:14,920 --> 03:43:18,993
You like books cause you can
close them whenever you want.

2530
03:43:19,200 --> 03:43:22,272
Life is different,
you can't decide that.

2531
03:43:32,800 --> 03:43:34,791
You're wrong.

2532
03:43:36,160 --> 03:43:41,188
I've always decided. Also
not to see you anymore.

2533
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:46,549
- That's not a choice.
- Good girl, you got it!

2534
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:51,515
I'm an asshole, I suck.
You better lose me.

2535
03:43:51,720 --> 03:43:53,007
Now leave.

2536
03:43:53,209 --> 03:43:57,053
- You aren't like that.
- What the hell...

2537
03:43:57,267 --> 03:43:58,751
...do you want from me?

2538
03:43:58,907 --> 03:44:01,938
- Nicola...
- My name's Matteo!

2539
03:44:02,640 --> 03:44:04,710
Go away!

2540
03:44:14,080 --> 03:44:18,790
- Let's play "Merchant at the Fair"!
- Yes! - No!

2541
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:23,039
- It's a good game.
- You're snobbish!

2542
03:44:23,240 --> 03:44:26,232
- We'll play it.
- Who plays the Merchant?

2543
03:44:26,400 --> 03:44:30,234
- You will, as you're impartial.
- No.

2544
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:33,830
- You're a judge!
- Who plays the bidder?

2545
03:44:34,040 --> 03:44:38,397
- Carlo, he's into trade!
- No!

2546
03:44:38,600 --> 03:44:42,275
- Come on Carlo!
- Okay. Not because I'm a merchant,

2547
03:44:42,480 --> 03:44:45,119
but because I'm the only
good one here!

2548
03:44:47,600 --> 03:44:50,478
Read again and sign it.

2549
03:44:51,640 --> 03:44:55,633
You wait here, a colleague
will take you downstairs.

2550
03:44:58,640 --> 03:45:01,712
We're not done yet.

2551
03:45:01,920 --> 03:45:03,911
Sit down.

2552
03:45:04,800 --> 03:45:06,791
Sit down!

2553
03:45:15,280 --> 03:45:19,273
How much money will he give you
if you go to prison in his place?

2554
03:45:19,400 --> 03:45:21,868
- What?
- How much?

2555
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:25,044
- This is a serious accusation!
- Shut up!

2556
03:45:25,310 --> 03:45:26,412
I won't!

2557
03:45:26,520 --> 03:45:30,399
I want to call my lawyer.
You can't treat me like that!

2558
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:34,070
Does he give you the drugs?

2559
03:45:34,280 --> 03:45:38,034
You're a penniless wretch.
Where do you find the money?

2560
03:45:39,280 --> 03:45:42,238
Does he give it to you?

2561
03:45:42,680 --> 03:45:44,318
Does he?

2562
03:45:51,880 --> 03:45:53,950
What do you want?
Who are you?

2563
03:45:54,160 --> 03:45:59,393
- Don't try and fool me!
- That's not fair!

2564
03:45:59,600 --> 03:46:03,957
- I want my lawyer!
- You'll remember tonight forever!

2565
03:46:04,160 --> 03:46:06,355
Lawyer my foot!

2566
03:46:07,720 --> 03:46:10,951
That's not fair at all.

2567
03:46:12,160 --> 03:46:16,153
A friend of mine is a Deputy.
I'll have you transferred!

2568
03:46:16,280 --> 03:46:20,068
- And I'll break your teeth!
- Calm down!

2569
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:27,110
How dare you!

2570
03:46:28,400 --> 03:46:32,029
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

2571
03:46:32,240 --> 03:46:36,153
I don't want to get
in trouble because of you.

2572
03:46:37,800 --> 03:46:41,952
But remember,
he's got nothing to do with it.

2573
03:46:45,560 --> 03:46:51,157
- It's 500 lire each. Take your change.
- Hurry up!

2574
03:46:51,360 --> 03:46:55,148
Here are some cards...

2575
03:46:55,360 --> 03:47:00,229
...which Agnelli himself would like
to have, and they're yours for 1,500 lire.

2576
03:47:00,440 --> 03:47:04,228
- 1,600!
- The doctor said 1,600.

2577
03:47:04,440 --> 03:47:07,497
- 2,000!
- Adriana offered 2,000.

2578
03:47:07,597 --> 03:47:10,467
- 2,500.
- Little Sara said 2,500.

2579
03:47:10,560 --> 03:47:13,211
- 2,500.
- 2,800.

2580
03:47:13,311 --> 03:47:15,543
Where will you find the money?

2581
03:47:15,560 --> 03:47:17,676
I'll give him the money.

2582
03:47:17,880 --> 03:47:20,236
He got Giovanni Agnelli's cards!

2583
03:47:20,336 --> 03:47:22,460
- Who can it be?
- I'll get it.

2584
03:47:23,560 --> 03:47:26,120
- Who is it?
- Who can it be?

2585
03:47:29,200 --> 03:47:33,591
- Happy new year mom.
- I knew you'd come.

2586
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:38,311
Come in.

2587
03:47:40,320 --> 03:47:42,390
Oh, oh...

2588
03:47:43,400 --> 03:47:46,278
- Look who's coming...
- Merry Christmas!

2589
03:47:49,040 --> 03:47:52,032
- How are you?
- How are you? Merry Christmas.

2590
03:47:52,840 --> 03:47:54,831
- Best wishes.
- Welcome.

2591
03:47:56,200 --> 03:47:58,839
By the way this isn't
a gambling house, officer.

2592
03:47:59,080 --> 03:48:01,389
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

2593
03:48:02,200 --> 03:48:05,351
- Little sister!
- Where's my change?

2594
03:48:06,720 --> 03:48:08,836
<i>This is uncle's change.</i>

2595
03:48:09,040 --> 03:48:12,396
- Where are the other two?
- They're sleeping.

2596
03:48:16,840 --> 03:48:19,526
- Sara!
- Hi.

2597
03:48:19,626 --> 03:48:21,519
- Remember me?
- Yes.

2598
03:48:21,619 --> 03:48:25,233
- You're the fast driver.
- And here are some cards

2599
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:29,035
- for the fast driver...
- Okay.

2600
03:48:29,240 --> 03:48:32,118
Two cards for him.

2601
03:48:32,320 --> 03:48:37,314
I have some other cards here...

2602
03:48:37,520 --> 03:48:42,878
- Did I hear Orlandino speak?
- 6,500! - 6,500!

2603
03:48:43,080 --> 03:48:48,108
- 7,000.
- Don't go higher or Sara can't bet.

2604
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:49,431
Mom!

2605
03:48:49,531 --> 03:48:53,040
I'll give Sara the money.
I can lend you a million.

2606
03:48:53,080 --> 03:48:57,870
It's not fair to lend money
secretly. How much was it?

2607
03:48:58,080 --> 03:49:02,949
- 10,000! - No.
- 8,300. - 8,300.

2608
03:49:03,160 --> 03:49:09,030
I heard something
which leaves no doubt.

2609
03:49:09,240 --> 03:49:12,391
10,000 one, 10,000 two...
10,000 three!

2610
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:21,715
The grapes card.

2611
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:24,058
- Who has the grapes?
- I don't.

2612
03:49:24,635 --> 03:49:26,667
He collapsed.

2613
03:49:26,818 --> 03:49:28,872
- Where are the others?
- Sleeping.

2614
03:49:29,080 --> 03:49:32,755
- Aren't you going to bed, Sara?
- No, I want to win.

2615
03:49:32,960 --> 03:49:37,511
Fair enough.
Remember that the grapes came out.

2616
03:49:37,720 --> 03:49:41,838
And as it's Christmas,
the Baby card came out too.

2617
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:44,031
- Here it is.
- I'm out.

2618
03:49:45,760 --> 03:49:50,231
- Mom I have to call my office.
- Go to my bedroom.

2619
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:53,477
- How many cards left?
- Nine.

2620
03:49:53,680 --> 03:49:55,671
Attention please.

2621
03:49:55,880 --> 03:49:58,917
It's an animal.

2622
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:01,111
- Carlo!
- No.

2623
03:50:01,320 --> 03:50:05,677
- It starts with "Ca" though.
- Go ahead, I'll be right back.

2624
03:50:05,880 --> 03:50:07,669
- Camel.
- No.

2625
03:50:07,769 --> 03:50:10,557
- Canary.
- No.

2626
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:20,558
- All's well?
- Yes.

2627
03:50:20,760 --> 03:50:26,517
- You still have my school-report!
- They're all full marks.

2628
03:50:26,720 --> 03:50:29,917
- You were so good.
- I was good.

2629
03:50:31,320 --> 03:50:33,494
What should I do with this?

2630
03:50:33,594 --> 03:50:36,169
- I'll put it in a drawer.
- No.

2631
03:50:36,280 --> 03:50:38,396
There are the kids.

2632
03:50:38,600 --> 03:50:40,591
I'll take care of it.

2633
03:51:03,280 --> 03:51:05,350
I'll leave you alone.

2634
03:51:08,240 --> 03:51:13,030
Mom I don't know
if I can stay till midnight.

2635
03:51:13,240 --> 03:51:16,437
- You know, my work...
- It's okay.

2636
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:20,679
It was great to see you anyway.

2637
03:51:21,400 --> 03:51:24,153
- Shall I close the door?
- Yes please.

2638
03:51:49,320 --> 03:51:54,075
- Here's an animal again.
- What happened? - Nothing.

2639
03:51:54,280 --> 03:51:58,319
Adriana's just arrived
and has given me a zebra.

2640
03:52:17,480 --> 03:52:20,597
"I'm not in..."

2641
03:52:34,160 --> 03:52:38,438
- I'll go get some food.
- Who's taking your place?

2642
03:52:38,640 --> 03:52:41,842
Go the other way
or you'll wake up the kids.

2643
03:52:42,390 --> 03:52:43,764
So...

2644
03:52:43,936 --> 03:52:49,238
We have an animal which swims

2645
03:52:49,440 --> 03:52:54,504
into small lakes. It's the swan.

2646
03:52:55,156 --> 03:52:58,824
- Resist Sara!
- Sara has the swan.

2647
03:52:58,924 --> 03:53:00,626
Darn it!

2648
03:53:00,805 --> 03:53:03,589
Don't worry, you have other cards.

2649
03:53:03,840 --> 03:53:09,233
<i>Two cards left.
An animal which... enough</i>

2650
03:53:09,440 --> 03:53:13,558
<i>It's an animal, a peacock.</i>

2651
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:15,751
Are you leaving?

2652
03:53:17,520 --> 03:53:20,990
- There's an emergency.
- Sure.

2653
03:53:21,200 --> 03:53:24,078
- Want some "torrone"?
- No thanks.

2654
03:53:24,280 --> 03:53:27,909
- Say bye-bye to mom at least.
- I have no time.

2655
03:53:28,020 --> 03:53:29,718
- It won't take long.
- No.

2656
03:53:29,778 --> 03:53:32,731
- Are you staying in Rome?
- Yes, for two days.

2657
03:53:32,831 --> 03:53:34,717
- See you.
- Will you call me?

2658
03:53:34,817 --> 03:53:36,788
- Yes.
- Promised?

2659
03:53:37,489 --> 03:53:40,276
Yes.

2660
03:53:44,320 --> 03:53:49,792
What's wrong?

2661
03:53:55,400 --> 03:53:59,188
- The first prize goes to the cat!
- Yeah! Hurray!

2662
03:53:59,300 --> 03:54:01,202
What do you say
when the cat comes out?

2663
03:54:01,302 --> 03:54:03,588
- Long live the Fair!
- Yes!

2664
03:54:04,925 --> 03:54:07,321
Long live the Fair, Sara!

2665
03:55:24,160 --> 03:55:27,948
"I'm not in, please leave a message..."

2666
03:55:28,160 --> 03:55:31,232
"...or call my office at 702254."

2667
03:55:47,480 --> 03:55:49,038
Matteo!

2668
03:55:57,960 --> 03:56:00,952
I need to call
the Police Headquarters...

2669
03:56:32,240 --> 03:56:37,792
(Tv) Let's drink to the new year!

2670
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:42,357
"It's going to be
new year's day in a while."

2671
03:56:46,640 --> 03:56:49,473
"Let's see what's
happening elsewhere."

2672
03:57:39,120 --> 03:57:40,917
"So..."

2673
03:57:55,440 --> 03:57:59,115
"Get ready for the toast."

2674
03:57:59,720 --> 03:58:02,029
"I can see three beautiful girls."

2675
03:58:13,160 --> 03:58:16,152
(Tv) "Glasses ready!"

2676
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:19,471
"Anyone missing?"

2677
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:23,717
"Here we are."

2678
03:58:25,480 --> 03:58:27,516
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

2679
03:58:27,720 --> 03:58:30,518
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

2680
03:58:30,720 --> 03:58:34,349
- Happy new year everyone!
- Happy new year.

2681
03:58:34,560 --> 03:58:38,269
Happy new year!

2682
03:59:20,480 --> 03:59:25,110
This morning when the ambulance
and the police arrived

2683
03:59:25,320 --> 03:59:28,392
a beautiful girl came.

2684
03:59:28,600 --> 03:59:32,139
Her hair was dark.
Her eyes... I don't know.

2685
03:59:32,239 --> 03:59:33,049
It doesn't matter.

2686
03:59:33,149 --> 03:59:37,954
It was strange because your
brother never brought any girl in.

2687
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:43,359
I used to say: "Such a
good-looking man with no girlfriends!"

2688
03:59:44,720 --> 03:59:46,711
Go ahead.

2689
03:59:46,920 --> 03:59:51,994
The girl asked me
about your brother.

2690
03:59:52,200 --> 03:59:55,556
I told her what happened

2691
03:59:55,760 --> 03:59:59,150
and she ran away.

2692
03:59:59,360 --> 04:00:02,352
- Maybe you know her.
- No.

2693
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:09,117
He was so good, so kind,
a real gentleman!

2694
04:00:09,320 --> 04:00:12,357
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

2695
04:00:13,360 --> 04:00:17,956
Look, you'll think I'm crazy,

2696
04:00:18,160 --> 04:00:22,358
but I think your brother was pushed.

2697
04:00:22,560 --> 04:00:24,859
- Nonsense!
- Sorry.

2698
04:00:24,959 --> 04:00:28,557
- Take this lady downstairs.
- Officer please.

2699
04:00:30,760 --> 04:00:35,038
Doctor, is your brother
identifying the body for the report?

2700
04:00:35,240 --> 04:00:37,595
No, I am.

2701
04:00:37,800 --> 04:00:41,793
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Stay with mom.

2702
04:00:42,000 --> 04:00:44,766
- Okay.
- Stay with mom.

2703
04:00:45,062 --> 04:00:46,351
I will.

2704
04:01:56,640 --> 04:01:58,995
It's time to go.

2705
04:02:00,440 --> 04:02:02,829
All these books!

2706
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:08,832
Get some bags,
let's take the books.

2707
04:02:10,400 --> 04:02:13,517
We can't take
all of them right now.

2708
04:02:13,720 --> 04:02:16,712
I'll do it tomorrow.

2709
04:02:19,240 --> 04:02:21,231
Only a few of them, please.

2710
04:02:23,160 --> 04:02:25,151
Okay.

2711
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:16,591
Mom!

2712
04:03:19,160 --> 04:03:21,151
Mom!

2713
04:03:21,560 --> 04:03:24,757
Please, stop!

2714
04:03:25,080 --> 04:03:27,071
Mom!

2715
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:33,275
Enough!

2716
04:03:34,000 --> 04:03:35,991
Enough!

2717
04:03:37,240 --> 04:03:39,470
Calm down!

2718
04:04:48,080 --> 04:04:51,072
<i>I was supposed to understand</i>

2719
04:04:52,720 --> 04:04:55,757
<i>But I didn't.</i>

2720
04:04:56,640 --> 04:05:00,076
<i>No, maybe I understood, but...</i>

2721
04:05:03,760 --> 04:05:06,832
It was like with Giulia.

2722
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:10,512
I could have stopped her.

2723
04:05:13,240 --> 04:05:16,357
He was in front of me as well

2724
04:05:19,440 --> 04:05:24,594
he turned around,
looked at me and I...

2725
04:05:26,960 --> 04:05:30,953
closed the door
and deleted everything.

2726
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:34,992
There's nothing left in my mind.

2727
04:05:37,080 --> 04:05:41,198
The stairs of his house,
the saw-dust on the ground... Nothing.

2728
04:05:41,400 --> 04:05:44,551
The books on the floor, the porter...

2729
04:05:46,200 --> 04:05:49,192
I should have stopped them.

2730
04:05:53,800 --> 04:05:57,110
I loved them both,

2731
04:05:59,120 --> 04:06:04,399
but I couldn't chain them

2732
04:06:04,600 --> 04:06:09,390
to that love of mine.
That was my idea of freedom.

2733
04:06:11,760 --> 04:06:16,709
I thought that everyone
should be free to live as they wished.

2734
04:06:17,680 --> 04:06:20,672
What freedom is in death?

2735
04:06:25,480 --> 04:06:27,516
But did it happen?

2736
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:33,671
Did it really happen?
Cause I don't believe it.

2737
04:06:37,921 --> 04:06:43,871
I realise what happened
only when I look at mom.

2738
04:06:46,241 --> 04:06:50,712
- I'm glad you can stay with her.
- I have to leave soon though.

2739
04:06:50,921 --> 04:06:56,075
- I asked for a transfer to Sicily.
- Sicily?

2740
04:06:56,281 --> 04:07:00,877
Yes, they need people and
no one wants to go there.

2741
04:07:05,001 --> 04:07:10,029
I still have a postcard you
sent me from Cape North in 1966.

2742
04:07:10,241 --> 04:07:15,918
It was in Norwegian,
and it said:

2743
04:07:16,121 --> 04:07:21,673
..."Everything is beautiful"
with three exclamation marks.

2744
04:07:23,281 --> 04:07:27,957
- Do you still believe that?
- Not to the exclamation marks.

2745
04:07:30,801 --> 04:07:32,792
Listen Giovanna.

2746
04:07:34,001 --> 04:07:37,755
Giulia is in Rome.
I'll meet her tomorrow.

2747
04:07:37,961 --> 04:07:42,830
She told Francesca
she wants to see Sara.

2748
04:07:43,041 --> 04:07:47,034
- I will go in her place.
- I don't want to listen.

2749
04:07:47,201 --> 04:07:49,514
Giulia wants to see Sara.

2750
04:07:49,614 --> 04:07:52,122
- Shut up!
- This time I won't!

2751
04:07:52,361 --> 04:07:55,778
The date is at the Coliseum,
tomorrow at 10.

2752
04:07:55,878 --> 04:07:58,029
And what am I
supposed to do?

2753
04:08:00,121 --> 04:08:05,434
Do you think it's easy for me
to ask you to arrest her

2754
04:08:05,641 --> 04:08:07,632
and bury her in a prison?

2755
04:08:10,081 --> 04:08:13,869
Should I wait
for her to kill someone?

2756
04:08:16,841 --> 04:08:20,834
Should I wait
for her to be killed?

2757
04:09:37,321 --> 04:09:39,312
Now!

2758
04:09:49,441 --> 04:09:53,320
Doctor Carati, Giorgia
wants to speak with you.

2759
04:09:55,321 --> 04:09:58,154
Tell her I can't.

2760
04:09:59,321 --> 04:10:01,312
Francesca!

2761
04:10:05,961 --> 04:10:09,033
Bring her here, please. I'll wait.

2762
04:10:16,001 --> 04:10:19,038
How shall I tell her?

2763
04:10:19,961 --> 04:10:21,952
How can I?

2764
04:10:23,561 --> 04:10:26,712
Cheer up! Come on!

2765
04:11:17,241 --> 04:11:20,233
Giorgia, I must tell you something.

2766
04:11:22,001 --> 04:11:25,914
A bad thing happened.

2767
04:11:29,081 --> 04:11:32,073
I had Giulia arrested.

2768
04:11:33,241 --> 04:11:35,471
I thought that

2769
04:11:36,481 --> 04:11:41,396
it was the best thing to do.

2770
04:11:45,281 --> 04:11:49,593
She made a bad choice, so I think

2771
04:11:52,561 --> 04:11:54,756
it's better this way.

2772
04:11:57,041 --> 04:12:01,717
Then there's another
bad thing I have to tell you.

2773
04:12:16,361 --> 04:12:18,352
Matteo...

2774
04:12:26,441 --> 04:12:28,432
Matteo...

2775
04:12:33,601 --> 04:12:35,592
Matteo is...

2776
04:12:40,321 --> 04:12:42,312
Matteo!

2777
04:12:52,681 --> 04:12:56,674
"You force my thought to wander
on the paths leading to the eternal void."

2778
04:12:56,881 --> 04:13:00,874
"And all the while these evil times
fleet by, bearing away the horde of cares..."

2779
04:13:01,081 --> 04:13:05,233
" consuming time and me.
And as I contemplate your peace..."

2780
04:13:05,441 --> 04:13:09,798
"...the soul of the warrior roaring
within me sleeps." Shall I comment on it?

2781
04:13:20,001 --> 04:13:21,992
Shall I comment on it?

2782
04:13:26,641 --> 04:13:31,874
The sonnet "To the Evening" is
one of Foscolo's most inspired ones.

2783
04:13:32,081 --> 04:13:35,198
It includes an alliterated line,

2784
04:13:35,401 --> 04:13:38,950
"...the soul of the warrior
roaring within me...".

2785
04:13:39,161 --> 04:13:42,039
which is full of "Rs"...

2786
04:13:42,241 --> 04:13:46,280
"...the soul of the warrior roaring
within me"

2787
04:13:46,481 --> 04:13:51,077
You can almost
hear the poet roar.

2788
04:14:13,281 --> 04:14:15,841
Back to your seat.

2789
04:14:18,681 --> 04:14:20,672
Go.

2790
04:15:13,641 --> 04:15:15,632
<i>Adriana.</i>

2791
04:15:22,921 --> 04:15:27,676
- How are your French lessons going?
- Well.

2792
04:15:56,281 --> 04:15:58,272
Thanks.

2793
04:16:53,761 --> 04:16:58,630
- Your wife was told you're here.
- She isn't my wife.

2794
04:17:00,041 --> 04:17:04,034
- But she wants to stay in her cell.
- Tell her the child is here too,

2795
04:17:04,201 --> 04:17:07,955
- and that I'm waiting for her.
- Alright.

2796
04:17:26,321 --> 04:17:28,312
Where's Sara?

2797
04:17:29,161 --> 04:17:33,393
With Giovanna.
I'll call her in a minute.

2798
04:17:34,601 --> 04:17:37,593
But I wanted to tell you
something before.

2799
04:17:39,081 --> 04:17:43,004
I won't leave you alone.
You're here but...

2800
04:17:43,258 --> 04:17:44,923
I can't hear you.

2801
04:17:48,921 --> 04:17:54,041
Remember when we argued
before Sara was born?

2802
04:17:54,561 --> 04:17:57,633
We said it was a mere formality,

2803
04:17:58,761 --> 04:18:01,229
but it isn't.

2804
04:18:02,241 --> 04:18:04,232
Giulia...

2805
04:18:04,441 --> 04:18:06,591
will you marry me?

2806
04:18:10,921 --> 04:18:12,912
Did you hear?

2807
04:18:13,881 --> 04:18:16,315
I want to marry you.

2808
04:18:16,921 --> 04:18:18,912
Giulia, please.

2809
04:18:20,041 --> 04:18:24,273
I want you to marry me.
I'm asking for your hand!

2810
04:18:25,321 --> 04:18:27,312
Giulia, please!

2811
04:18:30,201 --> 04:18:34,035
Look, I don't want you
to come here anymore...

2812
04:18:34,241 --> 04:18:39,240
- ...and don't bring Sara here.
- I'll call her now.

2813
04:18:39,340 --> 04:18:41,447
- I can't see her.
- You can.

2814
04:18:41,547 --> 04:18:42,704
I don't want to!

2815
04:18:42,961 --> 04:18:47,637
She wants to see you!
She was 4 when you left!

2816
04:18:47,841 --> 04:18:50,435
Now you must see her!

2817
04:18:50,641 --> 04:18:53,838
Please, Giulia!

2818
04:18:54,041 --> 04:18:56,111
- I can't make it!
- You can...

2819
04:18:57,681 --> 04:18:59,751
You can make it!

2820
04:19:00,961 --> 04:19:05,034
Come on!
Let's wait a minute, okay?

2821
04:19:05,241 --> 04:19:08,438
So she won't realize
that you cried.

2822
04:19:09,561 --> 04:19:11,552
Okay?

2823
04:19:40,841 --> 04:19:42,991
Okay.

2824
04:19:48,521 --> 04:19:50,512
Sara...

2825
04:19:51,801 --> 04:19:53,792
Sara, look at me.

2826
04:19:57,721 --> 04:20:00,519
You grew up.

2827
04:20:02,481 --> 04:20:04,597
Honey, look at me.

2828
04:20:10,481 --> 04:20:15,271
- But weren't you blonde before?
- I'll be blonde again soon.

2829
04:20:31,633 --> 04:20:34,970
HIGH SECURITY PRISON

2830
04:20:35,310 --> 04:20:38,302
<i>Monfalco, you've got mail!</i>

2831
04:20:39,291 --> 04:20:41,205
SPRING OF 1992

2832
04:20:47,430 --> 04:20:50,422
<i>Monfalco, you've got mail!</i>

2833
04:21:26,458 --> 04:21:31,187
"My love, here's something
that only you can read."

2834
04:22:41,870 --> 04:22:43,861
Excuse me!

2835
04:22:47,590 --> 04:22:49,387
Excuse me!

2836
04:22:50,990 --> 04:22:54,983
Send it back, I don't want it.

2837
04:23:18,070 --> 04:23:20,459
Fight.

2838
04:23:31,990 --> 04:23:33,389
Very well.

2839
04:23:33,510 --> 04:23:35,501
Fight.

2840
04:23:40,750 --> 04:23:42,422
Sara!

2841
04:23:43,750 --> 04:23:44,944
Bravo!

2842
04:23:45,070 --> 04:23:47,061
Come on Sara!

2843
04:23:47,190 --> 04:23:48,339
Go!

2844
04:23:48,470 --> 04:23:50,461
Fight.

2845
04:24:00,070 --> 04:24:02,061
Fight.

2846
04:24:26,070 --> 04:24:30,746
I won this medal
in a swimming race in 1964.

2847
04:24:30,870 --> 04:24:35,022
- Take it, so you'll have one too now.
- Are you kidding me?

2848
04:24:35,150 --> 04:24:38,142
I wanted my own medal.
I was supposed to win.

2849
04:24:38,270 --> 04:24:44,106
- I always beat that girl before.
- Come on, eat your food.

2850
04:24:46,590 --> 04:24:49,710
Tomorrow I'm going to Milan.
Will you go to sleep at Alessia's?

2851
04:24:49,788 --> 04:24:51,184
What are you going there for?

2852
04:24:51,393 --> 04:24:55,903
A psychiatric examination
to a prison inmate.

2853
04:24:56,310 --> 04:25:00,940
- Who's that?
- The manager of a public enterprise.

2854
04:25:01,070 --> 04:25:05,268
The Defence asked for his release
for health's problems.

2855
04:25:05,390 --> 04:25:10,066
- He said he's going crazy inside there.
- First they steal then they cry.

2856
04:25:10,190 --> 04:25:11,953
How do you know?

2857
04:25:11,954 --> 04:25:15,501
I think he deserved it. He should
have thought twice before.

2858
04:25:16,870 --> 04:25:19,862
- Why are you so mad at him?
- Because I hate

2859
04:25:19,990 --> 04:25:23,983
those who make others
pay for their own mistakes.

2860
04:25:26,790 --> 04:25:29,782
Why don't you ask me
what I'm thinking of?

2861
04:25:29,910 --> 04:25:34,188
Because I always know when
you're thinking about your mother.

2862
04:25:34,310 --> 04:25:39,942
The others had no children,
they were free. She wasn't!

2863
04:25:40,070 --> 04:25:45,986
- She knows that and she feels guilty.
- That's good!

2864
04:25:46,110 --> 04:25:50,422
- She didn't kill anyone.
- Only because you stopped her in time.

2865
04:26:05,630 --> 04:26:09,020
She doesn't want
to see me, or she can't...

2866
04:26:09,430 --> 04:26:12,422
That's fine, but what about you?

2867
04:26:12,550 --> 04:26:17,340
You write and she doesn't answer,
you go there and she doesn't want to see you.

2868
04:26:17,470 --> 04:26:19,198
This makes me angry!

2869
04:26:19,802 --> 04:26:22,590
- And what should I do?
- Find another woman!

2870
04:26:23,390 --> 04:26:26,183
My friends are
crazy for you.

2871
04:26:26,471 --> 04:26:28,210
- Don't you like Alessia, for example?
- Come on!

2872
04:26:28,270 --> 04:26:33,628
Well you're quite old after all,
you gained weight too...

2873
04:26:33,750 --> 04:26:36,548
You should be careful.

2874
04:26:37,230 --> 04:26:40,222
You're still in love with her.

2875
04:26:40,350 --> 04:26:42,190
I'm not.

2876
04:26:42,436 --> 04:26:45,387
You are, I read
the last letter you sent her.

2877
04:26:45,470 --> 04:26:47,600
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't do it on purpose,

2878
04:26:47,683 --> 04:26:49,133
it was on the table.

2879
04:26:49,201 --> 04:26:53,388
But you still love her,
and I don't want you to.

2880
04:26:53,510 --> 04:26:58,709
I would like to be able
to take my own decisions.

2881
04:26:58,830 --> 04:27:01,424
You're right, sorry.

2882
04:27:06,510 --> 04:27:09,502
Tell me, was that a fight?

2883
04:27:10,350 --> 04:27:14,946
No, you and I cannot fight.

2884
04:27:15,070 --> 04:27:17,061
Why?

2885
04:27:17,990 --> 04:27:20,788
Because I love you too much.

2886
04:27:22,310 --> 04:27:26,303
- You don't say it often.
- I don't say many other things.

2887
04:27:27,990 --> 04:27:32,700
- Like?
- I want to go to Rome

2888
04:27:32,830 --> 04:27:36,743
and become a restorer.
I'll live with Francesca and Carlo.

2889
04:27:36,870 --> 04:27:40,226
- You should ask them, before.
- I already have.

2890
04:27:43,990 --> 04:27:46,982
Will you be sad if I go there?

2891
04:27:50,590 --> 04:27:51,784
Yes.

2892
04:27:51,910 --> 04:27:55,220
I know, but I'll leave all the same.

2893
04:28:09,870 --> 04:28:11,861
Idiot.

2894
04:28:26,790 --> 04:28:30,578
You cannot speak
or you don't want to?

2895
04:28:35,990 --> 04:28:40,780
The Court asked me to examine you
and your lawyer agrees.

2896
04:28:40,910 --> 04:28:45,506
Do you agree too?
Just say "yes" or "no".

2897
04:28:52,390 --> 04:28:55,985
I know you have a daughter.
I have one too.

2898
04:28:57,270 --> 04:29:02,264
When one is in prison they feel like
their children are ashamed of them.

2899
04:29:03,030 --> 04:29:06,022
But our children
are stronger than us.

2900
04:29:06,150 --> 04:29:09,142
They're too full
of life and curiosity...

2901
04:29:09,270 --> 04:29:12,262
to get depressed because
of their fathers' misfortunes...

2902
04:29:13,670 --> 04:29:16,138
or their mothers'.

2903
04:29:16,270 --> 04:29:19,546
Are you here to check if I'm crazy?

2904
04:29:19,670 --> 04:29:22,742
You lawyer would love that.

2905
04:29:25,250 --> 04:29:27,530
My wife and daughter
don't know the truth.

2906
04:29:29,003 --> 04:29:30,991
I found out myself yesterday.

2907
04:29:31,750 --> 04:29:35,538
You didn't know you
were doing illegal things?

2908
04:29:35,670 --> 04:29:38,184
You work in a Hospital...

2909
04:29:38,310 --> 04:29:44,260
...Hospitals are paid
commissions too, it's normal.

2910
04:29:44,390 --> 04:29:48,906
Yet you never noticed
anything, did you?

2911
04:29:49,030 --> 04:29:51,908
Maybe you suspected it,

2912
04:29:52,030 --> 04:29:57,388
but pretended not to see,
as millions of Italians do.

2913
04:29:57,510 --> 04:30:00,308
Then, one day a judge arrives

2914
04:30:00,430 --> 04:30:04,423
and says that
commissions are bribes,

2915
04:30:04,550 --> 04:30:09,146
and that political parties
can't be financed secretly

2916
04:30:09,270 --> 04:30:13,263
and that I am a thief.
Wow...

2917
04:30:13,390 --> 04:30:18,703
Now prisons aren't only
full of unlucky apple-thieves.

2918
04:30:18,830 --> 04:30:21,822
Now justice is done!

2919
04:30:21,950 --> 04:30:25,943
But they forget they
queued to give us money...

2920
04:30:26,070 --> 04:30:30,063
...in change for
favours and contracts.

2921
04:30:30,190 --> 04:30:34,183
Now they play the part of those
who wanna change the world.

2922
04:30:35,750 --> 04:30:39,948
Doctor, nothing's
actually happening.

2923
04:30:40,790 --> 04:30:44,783
They arrested a bunch of idiots
like me who were caught stealing,

2924
04:30:44,910 --> 04:30:49,700
while all the others
keep stealing undisturbed.

2925
04:30:52,590 --> 04:30:55,900
I didn't make Italy.

2926
04:30:56,030 --> 04:30:58,225
Well, you didn't as well,

2927
04:30:59,350 --> 04:31:03,138
our fathers
made this Italy here.

2928
04:31:06,150 --> 04:31:09,062
My father didn't.

2929
04:31:09,190 --> 04:31:11,658
Believe me.

2930
04:31:12,830 --> 04:31:16,823
I'm sure your father
was an honest man,

2931
04:31:17,630 --> 04:31:21,225
and you like to feel
honest too, don't you?

2932
04:33:48,470 --> 04:33:52,065
- Excuse me, can I have your catalogue?
- Of course.

2933
04:33:52,670 --> 04:33:55,468
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

2934
04:33:58,470 --> 04:34:02,065
- Are the photos for sale?
- Almost all of them.

2935
04:34:02,190 --> 04:34:03,811
"Almost"?

2936
04:34:03,911 --> 04:34:08,017
Yes, the one in the poster
isn't, for example.

2937
04:34:14,990 --> 04:34:17,185
Where was he?

2938
04:34:18,190 --> 04:34:20,385
What was he doing?

2939
04:34:21,350 --> 04:34:23,739
Did you ask them?

2940
04:34:24,830 --> 04:34:27,822
No, those who took
the picture weren't there.

2941
04:34:29,790 --> 04:34:34,989
- Here's her name.
- "Mirella Utano".

2942
04:34:40,230 --> 04:34:42,619
Maybe they were for her.

2943
04:34:44,510 --> 04:34:46,501
What?

2944
04:34:47,470 --> 04:34:51,748
His eyes, maybe
they were for her.

2945
04:34:53,350 --> 04:34:58,344
Who is she?
When did she meet Matteo?

2946
04:34:59,870 --> 04:35:03,783
- What does she know about him?
- I don't know.

2947
04:35:03,910 --> 04:35:06,699
Maybe he saw him in the street
and took his picture.

2948
04:35:06,799 --> 04:35:08,289
No.

2949
04:35:09,150 --> 04:35:11,869
She spoke to him.

2950
04:35:19,390 --> 04:35:23,588
- You can keep the book.
- Thanks.

2951
04:35:25,670 --> 04:35:28,867
But I want you
to go and meet her.

2952
04:35:29,750 --> 04:35:33,186
- Who?
- Mirella.

2953
04:35:35,750 --> 04:35:40,778
- I want you to talk to her.
- Why should I?

2954
04:35:41,910 --> 04:35:44,299
Because I'm asking you.

2955
04:35:44,430 --> 04:35:48,503
I just do what's right, and this isn't.

2956
04:35:51,710 --> 04:35:56,659
Did you get offended?
Maybe you do everything I ask you?

2957
04:35:58,070 --> 04:36:01,062
I've asked you to get out of
here for a long time but you don't.

2958
04:36:01,190 --> 04:36:06,389
I asked you to go
and live with Elda and Gino.

2959
04:36:06,510 --> 04:36:09,308
- Did you do it?
- I'm fine here.

2960
04:36:09,430 --> 04:36:12,422
No, you only think
you are, but you aren't.

2961
04:36:12,550 --> 04:36:16,304
You have to go out
to understand that.

2962
04:36:18,030 --> 04:36:21,102
We're discharging
everyone but you.

2963
04:36:21,230 --> 04:36:23,949
You aren't a good man.

2964
04:36:24,070 --> 04:36:27,858
You aren't even skilled.
You used to be, now you aren't.

2965
04:36:27,990 --> 04:36:32,029
You were a good man,
now you aren't.

2966
04:36:44,830 --> 04:36:48,345
The famous European
law to abolish customs

2967
04:36:48,470 --> 04:36:52,827
wasn't understood
by us Italians.

2968
04:37:05,230 --> 04:37:07,869
<i>(Tv) "People..."</i>

2969
04:37:07,870 --> 04:37:10,631
<i>"won't be able to pay taxes."</i>

2970
04:37:11,550 --> 04:37:14,996
<i>"It's not that
they don't want to..."</i>

2971
04:37:14,997 --> 04:37:17,347
<i>"They already paid too many!"</i>

2972
04:39:45,910 --> 04:39:51,906
- Where's the Police Station please?
- Turn right at the end of the corridor.

2973
04:39:53,910 --> 04:39:56,708
Where did you want to go?

2974
04:39:59,270 --> 04:40:02,262
To the woman
who took the picture.

2975
04:40:06,150 --> 04:40:08,141
Why?

2976
04:40:09,430 --> 04:40:12,228
To speak with her.

2977
04:40:13,790 --> 04:40:19,660
I spoke to the police, everything's
settled. We can leave. Can we?

2978
04:40:22,310 --> 04:40:24,857
But I won't take you
back to the Institute.

2979
04:40:25,600 --> 04:40:27,027
Nicola, please...

2980
04:40:27,350 --> 04:40:30,342
- I can't.
- You can, instead.

2981
04:40:30,470 --> 04:40:32,665
- No.
- Yes!

2982
04:40:32,790 --> 04:40:36,385
You are already out.
You took Marcello's jacket.

2983
04:40:36,510 --> 04:40:39,502
He's still wondering where it is...

2984
04:40:39,630 --> 04:40:44,943
You took a streetcar
and came here all alone.

2985
04:40:45,070 --> 04:40:48,267
I won't take you back there.

2986
04:41:06,710 --> 04:41:09,304
That's the house.

2987
04:41:09,430 --> 04:41:12,422
- Are the others awake?
- I think so.

2988
04:41:12,550 --> 04:41:17,544
A bus will take a few
of them to work in a while.

2989
04:41:20,710 --> 04:41:25,909
- Do you think I can make it?
- You've already made it.

2990
04:41:30,590 --> 04:41:32,979
Thank you then.

2991
04:41:33,510 --> 04:41:38,948
Don't thank me. Matteo
made you leave the Hospital.

2992
04:41:39,070 --> 04:41:42,267
He gave us this present.

2993
04:41:43,350 --> 04:41:49,141
- Will you come to see me often?
- Not too often, but I will.

2994
04:41:49,270 --> 04:41:54,219
Smile, this is an important day.

2995
04:41:54,350 --> 04:41:56,739
Aren't you happy?

2996
04:42:02,950 --> 04:42:04,861
Go.

2997
04:42:04,990 --> 04:42:07,948
- Are you coming too?
- No.

2998
04:42:08,070 --> 04:42:12,666
Take your bag and buzz.
They'll open up. Come on!

2999
04:42:17,550 --> 04:42:20,747
- I want you to have it.
- But I gave it to you...

3000
04:42:20,870 --> 04:42:24,545
You can find the titles
at the end of the book.

3001
04:42:24,670 --> 04:42:28,379
Matteo's picture is number 7.

3002
04:42:48,110 --> 04:42:51,102
- Hi, Giampiero.
- Hi, Giorgia.

3003
04:43:08,270 --> 04:43:10,261
<i>"Se..."</i>

3004
04:43:12,430 --> 04:43:15,103
"...ven".

3005
04:43:25,300 --> 04:43:29,267
MATTEO, WHEN HE WAS NICOLA.

3006
04:43:36,270 --> 04:43:39,546
How can I contact her?

3007
04:43:41,510 --> 04:43:44,900
Alright.
Thanks anyways. Bye.

3008
04:43:46,670 --> 04:43:50,663
I was told she
doesn't live here in Milan.

3009
04:43:50,790 --> 04:43:54,180
Now she's in Palermo
for a report on the massacre.

3010
04:43:54,310 --> 04:43:59,862
- Which massacre?
- Judge Falcone was killed.

3011
04:44:09,310 --> 04:44:11,665
Judge Carati,

3012
04:44:11,790 --> 04:44:16,227
what happened exactly?

3013
04:44:29,710 --> 04:44:31,701
Where are you going?

3014
04:44:31,830 --> 04:44:35,618
- I need to speak with Judge Carati.
- That's impossible.

3015
04:44:35,750 --> 04:44:40,187
- I'm her brother, Nicola Carati.
- You can't see her.

3016
04:44:40,310 --> 04:44:42,505
Go away.

3017
04:44:43,590 --> 04:44:47,788
(Tv) "Here's Rosaria,
Vito Schifani's widow."

3018
04:44:49,470 --> 04:44:52,780
"She wants to speak."

3019
04:44:53,670 --> 04:44:56,662
"She gets closer
to Cardinal Pappalardo."

3020
04:44:57,150 --> 04:44:58,742
"Silence!"

3021
04:44:58,870 --> 04:45:03,660
"You must tell them
the Lord will punish them..."

3022
04:45:03,790 --> 04:45:08,989
- "...and they'll burn in Hell!"
- "Let's hope for them to change."

3023
04:45:09,110 --> 04:45:11,305
"You must tell them!"

3024
04:45:11,430 --> 04:45:15,981
"You said they'll change
too, they'll repent..."

3025
04:45:16,110 --> 04:45:21,901
- "...then they'll be forgiven."
- I haven't lost my hope, Father.

3026
04:45:23,630 --> 04:45:28,021
"People outside can
see the coffins now."

3027
04:45:29,030 --> 04:45:35,026
"They're all pressing
to pay tribute to them..."

3028
04:45:36,350 --> 04:45:39,547
"...to Giovanni Falcone,
Francesca Morvillo..."

3029
04:45:39,670 --> 04:45:43,663
"...Antonio Montinaro,
Vito Schifani, and Rocco Di Cillo."

3030
04:45:53,110 --> 04:45:56,102
You can wait here thanks.

3031
04:45:58,030 --> 04:45:59,314
Hi.

3032
04:46:01,023 --> 04:46:03,768
I knew you were in Palermo,
but these are terrible days.

3033
04:46:04,270 --> 04:46:09,264
I saw you this morning
but couldn't get close to you.

3034
04:46:11,110 --> 04:46:13,101
I'm tired.

3035
04:46:13,710 --> 04:46:18,306
We're all tired,
we're all so busy...

3036
04:46:18,430 --> 04:46:22,901
- I'd bury my head in the sand.
- You aren't like that...

3037
04:46:25,230 --> 04:46:29,428
- What are you doing in Palermo?
- I have to meet a person.

3038
04:46:29,550 --> 04:46:33,748
- Shall we have lunch together?
- I can't.

3039
04:46:34,070 --> 04:46:36,868
I only have half an hour left.

3040
04:46:36,990 --> 04:46:40,983
- How are mom and Francesca?
- I haven't been to Rome lately.

3041
04:46:41,110 --> 04:46:44,420
- What about Sara?
- She's really pretty.

3042
04:46:44,870 --> 04:46:49,068
She's always been.
What about you?

3043
04:46:49,710 --> 04:46:53,100
- And you?
- I'm the judge, I ask questions.

3044
04:46:57,390 --> 04:47:00,985
Hello?
Hi, thanks for calling me back.

3045
04:47:01,790 --> 04:47:04,782
Yes, tomorrow is perfect.

3046
04:47:05,270 --> 04:47:07,659
Where?
That's fine.

3047
04:47:08,070 --> 04:47:10,061
See you.

3048
04:47:15,990 --> 04:47:18,584
It's not as it seems...

3049
04:47:20,630 --> 04:47:23,542
We shall teach
respect to our children.

3050
04:47:26,350 --> 04:47:29,467
We shall
do our duty!

3051
04:47:31,910 --> 04:47:34,902
We shall
respect justice!

3052
04:47:37,070 --> 04:47:41,143
We shall fight
against immorality!

3053
04:47:45,430 --> 04:47:50,584
We shall never ask kindly
for our rights to be respected!

3054
04:47:54,030 --> 04:47:58,023
We shall fight
against the Mafia!

3055
04:48:00,670 --> 04:48:05,061
We shall remember
Giovanni Falcone!

3056
04:48:08,630 --> 04:48:13,465
We shall remember
all the victims of the Mafia!

3057
04:48:17,630 --> 04:48:22,624
We shall remember
them as our siblings!

3058
04:48:26,790 --> 04:48:30,829
We shall love them
like our siblings!

3059
04:48:33,710 --> 04:48:38,704
We shall defend that love
being a good example for others!

3060
04:48:50,030 --> 04:48:54,820
Sorry to make you wait,
but I must develop them now.

3061
04:48:54,950 --> 04:48:56,941
We'll speak
when I'm done.

3062
04:49:10,110 --> 04:49:12,499
Won't you get bored?

3063
04:49:27,270 --> 04:49:29,261
Thanks.

3064
04:49:32,710 --> 04:49:35,702
I took that picture here.

3065
04:49:37,510 --> 04:49:40,308
Right in this place.

3066
04:49:40,910 --> 04:49:43,504
It was different...

3067
04:49:45,030 --> 04:49:48,022
The towels were orange.

3068
04:49:52,710 --> 04:49:55,508
How long had you met him?

3069
04:49:56,470 --> 04:49:59,064
Five minutes.

3070
04:50:01,590 --> 04:50:05,185
He said his name was Nicola.

3071
04:50:05,950 --> 04:50:11,741
He never told me his real name,

3072
04:50:12,950 --> 04:50:15,748
I found out by myself.

3073
04:50:18,230 --> 04:50:21,222
I found out on the day...

3074
04:50:21,550 --> 04:50:23,541
...when...

3075
04:50:27,630 --> 04:50:31,703
I left the morning after,
I went back home.

3076
04:50:32,510 --> 04:50:37,868
I needed to stay
all alone for a while.

3077
04:50:40,550 --> 04:50:43,826
So you met him again in Rome?

3078
04:50:44,470 --> 04:50:45,869
Yes.

3079
04:50:52,270 --> 04:50:54,465
A few hours before he...

3080
04:50:57,830 --> 04:50:59,821
Sorry.

3081
04:51:03,270 --> 04:51:05,465
It's too hard..

3082
04:51:07,070 --> 04:51:10,062
For me too.

3083
04:51:11,230 --> 04:51:14,825
I still can't speak
about him with anyone.

3084
04:51:32,270 --> 04:51:34,261
I'm sorry.

3085
04:51:40,030 --> 04:51:42,624
I'm about to leave.

3086
04:51:48,590 --> 04:51:52,788
How can you live on an
island and be a reporter?

3087
04:51:52,910 --> 04:51:56,300
I only work
as much as I need.

3088
04:51:56,950 --> 04:51:59,748
When I'm needed,

3089
04:52:00,870 --> 04:52:05,068
as when important
things happen, like today.

3090
04:52:06,910 --> 04:52:12,701
- Are you going to Turin?
- Yes, returning home to my daughter.

3091
04:52:13,790 --> 04:52:19,422
- Do you have a daughter?
- Yes, Sara. She's 18.

3092
04:52:20,190 --> 04:52:24,229
She wants to be a restorer.

3093
04:52:24,950 --> 04:52:28,420
- She's a grown-up!
- Yes, she is!

3094
04:52:28,550 --> 04:52:30,905
Do you have children?

3095
04:52:33,270 --> 04:52:35,864
Yes, one.

3096
04:52:36,990 --> 04:52:41,984
He's about 8 and will be
in the third grade this year.

3097
04:52:47,430 --> 04:52:51,821
His name's Andrea and
he's as handsome as Matteo.

3098
04:54:00,710 --> 04:54:06,068
- Hello, can I help you?
- Thanks, sir. Don't bother...

3099
04:54:06,190 --> 04:54:08,909
- "Sir"?
- Nicola!

3100
04:54:09,030 --> 04:54:12,022
Mom, you look
like a poor oldie!

3101
04:54:12,150 --> 04:54:15,142
Because I am!

3102
04:54:22,750 --> 04:54:25,742
- What's this darkness?
- I can't stand the light.

3103
04:54:25,870 --> 04:54:29,021
It looks like a catacomb here.

3104
04:54:29,150 --> 04:54:34,144
- Giovanna used to draw the curtains.
- I'll do it.

3105
04:54:34,270 --> 04:54:37,660
- Let the light in.
- Don't make such a row.

3106
04:54:37,790 --> 04:54:39,906
It's a beautiful day.

3107
04:54:40,006 --> 04:54:42,407
- Please don't.
- Look at the sun.

3108
04:54:46,470 --> 04:54:50,668
Mom I have something
beautiful to tell you.

3109
04:54:53,630 --> 04:54:56,622
Something about Matteo.

3110
04:54:57,270 --> 04:55:01,263
One of those unpredictable
things he used to do.

3111
04:55:02,350 --> 04:55:06,548
When he was in Palermo he met
a woman, Mirella, and they had an affair.

3112
04:55:07,230 --> 04:55:10,222
- An affair?
- Yes, a love affair.

3113
04:55:10,350 --> 04:55:15,026
Mirella had a baby,
he was born after Matteo left us.

3114
04:55:15,150 --> 04:55:20,144
His name's Andrea. He'd love
to meet his granny.

3115
04:55:21,470 --> 04:55:24,462
- A baby?
- Yes mom.

3116
04:55:29,870 --> 04:55:34,068
We'll catch the train to Naples
and then the ferryboat to Sicily.

3117
04:55:34,190 --> 04:55:36,988
We'll be there
tomorrow morning.

3118
04:55:38,110 --> 04:55:41,785
- Wait a minute.
- What's wrong mom?

3119
04:55:42,590 --> 04:55:45,468
Want some water?

3120
04:55:45,590 --> 04:55:51,062
I can't... I'm not ready.

3121
04:55:51,190 --> 04:55:54,387
What does that mean?

3122
04:55:54,710 --> 04:55:58,703
- How do you know it's true?
- It is. I met the child.

3123
04:55:58,830 --> 04:56:03,381
Why didn't she tell us before?

3124
04:56:03,510 --> 04:56:05,501
Why didn't she write?

3125
04:56:05,630 --> 04:56:10,021
Why do you always have problems
when something good happens?

3126
04:56:12,910 --> 04:56:16,186
- Let's leave, mom.
- I can't.

3127
04:56:16,310 --> 04:56:18,949
Come on!

3128
04:56:24,950 --> 04:56:27,842
Sara wants to move to
Carlo and Francesca's place.

3129
04:56:27,942 --> 04:56:29,999
I know, we spoke about it.

3130
04:56:30,790 --> 04:56:34,260
Everybody knew it but me!

3131
04:56:34,390 --> 04:56:37,507
- Are you disappointed?
- No.

3132
04:56:37,630 --> 04:56:42,624
Sara needs to live in a
house where a mother is.

3133
04:56:42,750 --> 04:56:47,699
- Francesca is a good mother.
- Thanks honey.

3134
04:56:47,830 --> 04:56:52,426
- For what?
- For never being jealous of your siblings.

3135
04:56:52,550 --> 04:56:56,045
In fact I was jealous
of someone else.

3136
04:56:56,470 --> 04:56:58,668
- Of whom?
- Your students.

3137
04:56:58,768 --> 04:57:01,271
- My students?
- Yes.

3138
04:57:01,790 --> 04:57:06,580
You took them to see museums and to
our house, and checked their homework...

3139
04:57:06,710 --> 04:57:11,181
- I thought you loved them more than us.
- They lacked real families.

3140
04:57:11,310 --> 04:57:14,382
No one paid attention to them,
their parents never spoke to them.

3141
04:57:14,383 --> 04:57:15,837
And so you did that...

3142
04:57:17,790 --> 04:57:22,386
Yes, but maybe I should
have spoken with you more.

3143
04:57:22,510 --> 04:57:27,106
Come on mom, cheer up!

3144
04:57:27,230 --> 04:57:30,825
Don't speak Milanese,
you're so bad at it...

3145
04:57:30,950 --> 04:57:36,183
- How did you get used to Rome?
- It was love at first sight.

3146
04:57:36,310 --> 04:57:40,303
- It looks so decayed and ruined...
- Rotten and mephitic...

3147
04:57:40,430 --> 04:57:44,423
And its inhabitants
seem cynical and impolite,

3148
04:57:44,550 --> 04:57:47,462
but they're just full of irony.

3149
04:57:47,590 --> 04:57:50,423
- Do you know where I met your dad?
- No.

3150
04:57:50,550 --> 04:57:56,307
In Campo de' Fiori, at the market.
He was a costermonger.

3151
04:57:56,430 --> 04:57:59,422
He bought fruit and greens in Naples.
You know, one of his deals.

3152
04:57:59,550 --> 04:58:05,147
On his cart there was
a notice saying "Spanish oranges".

3153
04:58:05,270 --> 04:58:08,262
So I asked him if they
were really Spanish.

3154
04:58:08,390 --> 04:58:11,462
He replied: "Miss, can't
you hear the castanets?"

3155
04:58:13,030 --> 04:58:15,021
And what did you do?

3156
04:58:15,150 --> 04:58:18,381
I bought the oranges
and married him!

3157
04:59:35,150 --> 04:59:37,744
Andrea, they're here.

3158
04:59:46,030 --> 04:59:47,429
Hi.

3159
04:59:49,030 --> 04:59:52,386
- "Hi" and?
- Hi granny.

3160
04:59:52,510 --> 04:59:56,628
- Hi!
- Granny said "hi".

3161
04:59:56,750 --> 04:59:59,947
If you cry I'll hit you!

3162
05:00:13,070 --> 05:00:16,665
- I think they like each other.
- So do I.

3163
05:00:18,070 --> 05:00:21,779
By the way
I wanted to thank you.

3164
05:00:21,910 --> 05:00:24,205
- For what?
- For letting us come.

3165
05:00:24,305 --> 05:00:27,230
- I did nothing special.
- You could have said "no".

3166
05:00:27,330 --> 05:00:28,956
Come on...

3167
05:00:37,790 --> 05:00:40,384
- Where's your school?
- Over there.

3168
05:00:40,510 --> 05:00:44,105
- Will you attend middle school there too?
- No, in Lipari.

3169
05:00:44,870 --> 05:00:49,182
- Where's Lipari?
- There, but there's no volcano.

3170
05:00:49,590 --> 05:00:51,517
- Are you scared of volcanoes?
- No.

3171
05:00:51,617 --> 05:00:54,771
- What scares you?
- Nothing.

3172
05:00:54,871 --> 05:00:58,183
You're lucky. I'm
afraid of many things.

3173
05:00:58,283 --> 05:01:00,820
For example
I was afraid of coming here.

3174
05:01:00,950 --> 05:01:03,942
- Did the sea scare you?
- Yes.

3175
05:01:04,070 --> 05:01:07,062
- Why? You can't swim?
- No.

3176
05:01:07,190 --> 05:01:10,023
It's easy. I can teach you.

3177
05:01:14,550 --> 05:01:18,543
<i>"He spoke about faith,
which never abandoned him..."</i>

3178
05:01:18,670 --> 05:01:21,662
"not even when he was
on the verge of desperation."

3179
05:01:21,790 --> 05:01:25,783
"Of faith, which comes from
the knowledge of men and things."

3180
05:01:25,910 --> 05:01:28,902
"He spoke a long time,
as if he were speaking to himself..."

3181
05:01:29,030 --> 05:01:34,229
"...about his own courage and
energy under any circumstances."

3182
05:01:35,070 --> 05:01:37,664
Go ahead!

3183
05:01:38,830 --> 05:01:43,620
"His thoughts were so clear that
he never even changed his tone of voice."

3184
05:02:10,550 --> 05:02:14,259
These are pictures of Matteo.

3185
05:02:15,990 --> 05:02:19,426
I haven't been able
to look at them since...

3186
05:02:20,310 --> 05:02:23,108
I tried, sometimes.

3187
05:02:23,550 --> 05:02:25,745
My hands started shaking.

3188
05:02:29,190 --> 05:02:31,988
I want you to have them.

3189
05:02:33,910 --> 05:02:36,902
One day Andrea could be curious

3190
05:02:37,030 --> 05:02:40,625
to know what his father looked like
when he was a child.

3191
05:02:58,430 --> 05:03:01,228
Shall we look at them together?

3192
05:03:29,590 --> 05:03:33,139
- Bye.
- Thanks for everything.

3193
05:03:33,270 --> 05:03:35,261
See you soon.

3194
05:03:35,670 --> 05:03:38,821
- Let's go mom.
- Okay.

3195
05:03:40,670 --> 05:03:45,061
- I'll miss your eyes.
- If you cry I'll hit you!

3196
05:03:45,190 --> 05:03:50,025
- I'll hit you, you're annoying!
- Stay with us.

3197
05:03:51,141 --> 05:03:52,292
How?

3198
05:03:52,392 --> 05:03:55,024
There's a lot of room
here, and I'd love it.

3199
05:03:55,070 --> 05:03:58,028
- Andrea would as well, wouldn't you?
- Sure, granny. Stay!

3200
05:03:58,990 --> 05:04:00,981
Yes, stay.

3201
05:04:01,110 --> 05:04:05,501
- I don't have suitable clothes...
- You can buy some.

3202
05:04:05,630 --> 05:04:09,623
And I'll have Francesca
send you what you need.

3203
05:04:09,750 --> 05:04:11,820
- Should I stay then?
- Of course.

3204
05:04:11,950 --> 05:04:16,899
- Mom, can't you hear the castanets?
- Granny, can't you hear the castanets?

3205
05:04:54,070 --> 05:04:58,222
<i>The accelerator
is on the right!</i>

3206
05:05:00,590 --> 05:05:04,788
There are so many hats,
what should I do with them?

3207
05:05:07,150 --> 05:05:09,744
Alright, I'll keep them.

3208
05:05:09,870 --> 05:05:13,863
No, I didn't pack
the flowered dress.

3209
05:05:14,350 --> 05:05:17,467
Because... Wait a minute.

3210
05:05:17,590 --> 05:05:20,104
- You tell her.
- Thanks.

3211
05:05:20,230 --> 05:05:23,241
Hello? Yes granny.

3212
05:05:23,242 --> 05:05:24,867
I'm learning
the Roman dialect!

3213
05:05:26,470 --> 05:05:28,461
How are you?

3214
05:05:28,710 --> 05:05:32,669
Listen granny, as regards
the flowered dress...

3215
05:05:32,790 --> 05:05:36,578
Do you really need it?
You know, it's back in fashion...

3216
05:05:37,870 --> 05:05:43,183
- You'll look like an oldie wearing it.
- Viper!

3217
05:05:43,310 --> 05:05:48,338
Why do you want to look older?
It's perfect on me, instead.

3218
05:05:48,470 --> 05:05:53,419
- Francesca says it too.
- It's true, mom.

3219
05:05:53,550 --> 05:05:58,066
She looks... Remember that
picture of you and dad in Capri?

3220
05:05:58,190 --> 05:06:01,182
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

3221
05:06:01,910 --> 05:06:07,189
- Do I really look good?
- You look great!

3222
05:06:08,030 --> 05:06:13,582
I should wear high heels too,
but I can't walk in them.

3223
05:06:13,710 --> 05:06:16,707
Come on! The kids are
coming out of school!

3224
05:06:16,807 --> 05:06:18,895
- Can I drive?
- No.

3225
05:06:18,995 --> 05:06:21,389
- Please, only this time!
- No.

3226
05:06:47,190 --> 05:06:48,782
Thanks.

3227
05:07:00,670 --> 05:07:04,663
- I like this place.
- It's all ruined.

3228
05:07:04,790 --> 05:07:08,146
- But it's beautiful.
- They have to treat you well.

3229
05:07:08,270 --> 05:07:11,421
- I'll speak with the owner.
- Yes, please.

3230
05:07:47,070 --> 05:07:51,541
- When's the break finishing?
- Slavery's been over

3231
05:07:51,670 --> 05:07:56,221
- since Abraham Lincoln's times!
- "Desire to work, jump up at me!"

3232
05:08:07,310 --> 05:08:10,859
- "Speak less, work more!"
- Understood?

3233
05:08:10,990 --> 05:08:14,539
Teacher, you taught this kid well!

3234
05:08:25,540 --> 05:08:28,902
SPRING OF 1995

3235
05:08:46,590 --> 05:08:48,581
Let's go.

3236
05:08:56,990 --> 05:09:01,427
Observe a minute's silence
in front of this wonder.

3237
05:09:03,310 --> 05:09:06,586
Come on, don't
put on such faces!

3238
05:09:06,750 --> 05:09:09,117
This is a wonderful place.

3239
05:09:09,217 --> 05:09:11,837
- The landscape is beautiful.
- It is.

3240
05:09:11,870 --> 05:09:14,656
- What's that?
- That's clay.

3241
05:09:14,756 --> 05:09:16,394
It's a wreck!

3242
05:09:16,670 --> 05:09:20,709
Come on guys,
a little more imagination!

3243
05:09:20,830 --> 05:09:25,301
You don't have enough faith
or imagination. Follow me.

3244
05:09:26,270 --> 05:09:30,229
So, I need two or three
good ideas here.

3245
05:09:30,350 --> 05:09:34,423
Which ideas? Look
at those cracks!

3246
05:09:34,550 --> 05:09:39,340
- It needs new foundations.
- There are cracks in the frame!

3247
05:09:39,470 --> 05:09:43,019
That's why I called you,
Micavi Enterprises!

3248
05:09:43,150 --> 05:09:47,382
Okay, but you can't
lay foundations on clay!

3249
05:09:47,510 --> 05:09:52,220
I want sloping red bricks here.
Like in Piazza del Campo in Siena.

3250
05:09:52,350 --> 05:09:54,705
Of course!

3251
05:09:54,830 --> 05:09:58,505
- You're always complaining!
- Why? You're rich now!

3252
05:09:58,630 --> 05:10:02,145
- You're the owner!
- I'm rich in debts!

3253
05:10:02,270 --> 05:10:07,185
- Owners always complain.
- Stop it!

3254
05:10:07,310 --> 05:10:10,427
I'd like the windows there.

3255
05:10:10,550 --> 05:10:15,749
- I'd use aluminium for the windows.
- No way!

3256
05:10:15,870 --> 05:10:19,180
Aluminium window-frames?

3257
05:10:19,310 --> 05:10:22,985
Here I want the kitchen.
Look at this wonder!

3258
05:10:23,390 --> 05:10:26,905
Francesca wants it big.
Look at that fireplace.

3259
05:10:27,030 --> 05:10:29,339
Simply great!

3260
05:10:29,470 --> 05:10:32,268
Here I want a bathroom.

3261
05:10:32,950 --> 05:10:37,421
Here will be the nursery.
Every room must have a bath.

3262
05:10:37,550 --> 05:10:39,222
I count on that.

3263
05:10:39,350 --> 05:10:43,138
Here I want another studio,
or even... I don't know.

3264
05:10:43,270 --> 05:10:45,340
We'll think about it.

3265
05:10:45,470 --> 05:10:49,543
My only problem is I don't know
what to do with these pools.

3266
05:10:51,030 --> 05:10:55,421
- Shall I keep them?
- They aren't important.

3267
05:10:55,550 --> 05:10:59,509
But the floors need
loose stone foundations.

3268
05:10:59,630 --> 05:11:03,259
I want hand-made
terracotta tiles for the floors.

3269
05:11:03,390 --> 05:11:09,022
- Do you know how much it'll cost you?
- He wants it hand-made!

3270
05:11:09,150 --> 05:11:11,948
- Understood?
- Micavi...

3271
05:11:12,070 --> 05:11:16,461
I'm asking you officially.
Micavi Enterprises...

3272
05:11:16,590 --> 05:11:19,582
- Can you make it?
- Look at that!

3273
05:11:20,830 --> 05:11:23,298
God dam it...

3274
05:11:29,550 --> 05:11:31,541
If I can make it?

3275
05:11:32,790 --> 05:11:38,023
Depends... If you ask
me with respect...

3276
05:11:38,150 --> 05:11:40,983
...maybe I can do you a favour.

3277
05:11:53,070 --> 05:11:57,382
<i>- Hurry up! I'm starving!
- We're coming!</i>

3278
05:11:57,510 --> 05:12:00,502
He already speaks like a owner.

3279
05:12:02,630 --> 05:12:06,259
There's a boy who likes Sara...

3280
05:12:06,910 --> 05:12:11,938
I know, Francesca told me.
How is he? Did you see him?

3281
05:12:12,038 --> 05:12:14,805
- He comes home every day.
- Every day?

3282
05:12:14,905 --> 05:12:15,985
Yes.

3283
05:12:16,230 --> 05:12:19,586
He takes her to school

3284
05:12:19,710 --> 05:12:21,660
- and brings her back at night.
- At least he does!

3285
05:12:21,760 --> 05:12:24,505
- Yes.
- Fortunately!

3286
05:12:25,287 --> 05:12:28,585
Is he a good boy?
Trustworthy?

3287
05:12:29,150 --> 05:12:32,381
Yes, like you and I at his age.

3288
05:12:32,510 --> 05:12:36,139
Now I feel better! Thanks.

3289
05:12:37,350 --> 05:12:40,725
- Nicola will be a granny soon!
- Don't provoke me!

3290
05:12:40,825 --> 05:12:43,023
"Where shall I put granny..."

3291
05:12:43,123 --> 05:12:45,485
- Don't provoke me.
- Come on!

3292
05:12:45,790 --> 05:12:47,734
- We're starving.
- Let's light a fire.

3293
05:12:47,834 --> 05:12:50,549
Carlo, bring me some paper

3294
05:12:50,550 --> 05:12:52,343
- so we can light it.
- With my paper?

3295
05:12:52,443 --> 05:12:54,588
Just take it!

3296
05:13:19,990 --> 05:13:21,981
Hello?

3297
05:13:22,110 --> 05:13:26,183
Giulia, where are you?
No, she's at school.

3298
05:13:27,132 --> 05:13:29,035
Hello?

3299
05:14:20,430 --> 05:14:23,625
- Can I leave it here?
- Just for a minute.

3300
05:14:23,725 --> 05:14:24,757
Okay.

3301
05:14:28,670 --> 05:14:30,820
Thanks. I'll be right back.

3302
05:14:35,710 --> 05:14:37,666
Hi.

3303
05:14:44,870 --> 05:14:47,668
- Shall I call her?
- No.

3304
05:14:51,510 --> 05:14:55,503
- Are you coming home?
- No, I'm leaving at once.

3305
05:15:00,110 --> 05:15:03,386
- Who's that guy?
- Her boyfriend Mimmo.

3306
05:15:08,870 --> 05:15:12,749
I have to go.
Don't tell Sara you saw me.

3307
05:15:12,870 --> 05:15:15,623
- Why?
- Please.

3308
05:15:15,750 --> 05:15:17,547
I'll give you a lift.

3309
05:15:19,110 --> 05:15:23,023
- Stay here, please.
- Let me give you a lift...

3310
05:15:24,470 --> 05:15:26,426
Stay here. Really.

3311
05:15:47,150 --> 05:15:51,826
You don't have to stop his gestures,
or he'll think they make no sense,

3312
05:15:53,070 --> 05:15:55,968
while they make sense to him.

3313
05:15:56,068 --> 05:15:59,061
I'll try, even if that
seems impossible to me.

3314
05:15:59,070 --> 05:16:01,459
Nothing is impossible.

3315
05:16:02,310 --> 05:16:07,259
- I don't know what else I could do.
- Try to understand that sense.

3316
05:16:08,070 --> 05:16:11,460
- That's all.
- But it's like decrypting hieroglyphics!

3317
05:16:11,590 --> 05:16:14,582
In fact we did that little by little.

3318
05:16:16,190 --> 05:16:19,819
Let's have the usual meeting.
Can you call the others?

3319
05:16:20,830 --> 05:16:25,620
- Shall we wait for you inside?
- No, under that tree.

3320
05:16:26,430 --> 05:16:30,821
Okay kids. You have
to guess the animals.

3321
05:16:35,390 --> 05:16:40,987
My assistant Giacomo will mime.

3322
05:16:41,310 --> 05:16:45,940
<i>It's not easy...
It's a particular animal.</i>

3323
05:16:46,070 --> 05:16:51,667
<i>- Giacomo is a great mime.
- It's a lizard!</i>

3324
05:16:51,790 --> 05:16:55,700
It isn't a lizard, it crawls.

3325
05:16:56,776 --> 05:16:59,079
<i>- It's a cobra!
- No.</i>

3326
05:16:59,179 --> 05:17:02,190
<i>- It's long! So it's a cobra!
- It crawls but it's not a cobra.</i>

3327
05:17:02,290 --> 05:17:04,549
<i>- It's a snail!
- No.</i>

3328
05:17:04,670 --> 05:17:07,821
It isn't poisonous.

3329
05:17:07,990 --> 05:17:11,187
Let's say it has rings.

3330
05:17:11,310 --> 05:17:14,507
<i>- A worm!
- No, it has rings so it's a?</i>

3331
05:17:14,630 --> 05:17:18,509
<i>- Ring snake!
- Correct! Giacomo is very good.</i>

3332
05:17:18,630 --> 05:17:21,940
After becoming popular
in Munich, Paris and London,

3333
05:17:22,070 --> 05:17:26,143
our Giacomo will perform
as a mime again now.

3334
05:17:28,670 --> 05:17:30,530
This is difficult.

3335
05:17:30,630 --> 05:17:32,920
<i>- It's a hare!
- It isn't.</i>

3336
05:17:33,070 --> 05:17:36,270
- Shall I put it in your office?
- No, I'll check it here.

3337
05:17:36,370 --> 05:17:39,114
- Thanks.
- I've got mail.

3338
05:17:41,190 --> 05:17:45,945
The electricity bill,
a postcard from Giorgia...

3339
05:17:46,990 --> 05:17:48,981
Oh, there's a letter too.

3340
05:17:49,110 --> 05:17:54,104
But there's a mistake,
it's for Doctor Nicola Carati.

3341
05:17:54,230 --> 05:17:56,505
- Who's that?
- That's you!

3342
05:17:56,605 --> 05:17:57,862
Me?

3343
05:17:58,150 --> 05:18:01,291
- Yes, that's you!
- That's true, I always forget it.

3344
05:18:02,560 --> 05:18:04,130
Giacomo, will you read it?

3345
05:18:04,230 --> 05:18:07,686
<i>- He can't read!
- He can,</i>

3346
05:18:07,687 --> 05:18:11,143
and now he'll show you.

3347
05:18:12,990 --> 05:18:18,462
Let me open it up.
They used some special glue.

3348
05:18:18,590 --> 05:18:20,501
<i>Here you are.</i>

3349
05:18:20,630 --> 05:18:22,382
Read it.

3350
05:18:23,830 --> 05:18:28,984
Let everyone hear. Quiet
please, It's an important letter.

3351
05:18:30,110 --> 05:18:32,146
"Dear Ni-Nicola..."

3352
05:18:32,270 --> 05:18:35,148
"I w-wish..."

3353
05:18:35,270 --> 05:18:38,342
"...I never had to write..."

3354
05:18:38,470 --> 05:18:42,383
"t-this letter."

3355
05:18:44,150 --> 05:18:47,904
"Your m-mom..."

3356
05:18:48,270 --> 05:18:51,342
"...is d-dead."

3357
05:18:52,190 --> 05:18:56,980
"She didn't s-suffer."

3358
05:18:57,230 --> 05:19:02,543
"She f-fell asleep..."

3359
05:19:04,430 --> 05:19:07,149
"...slowly."

3360
05:19:07,950 --> 05:19:10,908
"I didn't write..."

3361
05:19:11,030 --> 05:19:15,820
"be-before because..."

3362
05:19:15,950 --> 05:19:21,388
"...she m-made me swear..."

3363
05:19:22,230 --> 05:19:26,168
"that w-when..."

3364
05:19:26,169 --> 05:19:30,106
"she died..."

3365
05:19:30,950 --> 05:19:35,580
"I didn't have to..."

3366
05:19:35,710 --> 05:19:41,103
"...d-disturb anyone."

3367
05:19:41,230 --> 05:19:44,267
"Kisses."

3368
05:19:44,390 --> 05:19:47,348
"S-see you s-soon."

3369
05:19:47,990 --> 05:19:50,584
"Mirella".

3370
05:19:53,070 --> 05:19:55,459
Very well, Giacomo.

3371
05:19:57,510 --> 05:20:00,741
You read very well.

3372
05:21:00,470 --> 05:21:03,462
Is my father buried near the sea?

3373
05:21:05,590 --> 05:21:09,378
- No.
- You must bring him here. There's the sea.

3374
05:21:12,910 --> 05:21:15,105
That's true.

3375
05:21:15,230 --> 05:21:18,028
I'll bring him here, I promise.

3376
05:21:20,470 --> 05:21:23,621
- How was he?
- He?

3377
05:21:25,110 --> 05:21:29,786
He was like Achilles. Did
granny tell you about Achilles?

3378
05:21:30,870 --> 05:21:34,465
- Yes.
- He was as brave and sad as him.

3379
05:21:34,590 --> 05:21:39,664
He knew the gods would take
him. You know how the gods are.

3380
05:21:39,790 --> 05:21:44,580
They send their favourite ones
here, then take them back.

3381
05:21:44,710 --> 05:21:48,419
But before that, they
make them leave a trace,

3382
05:21:48,550 --> 05:21:52,748
so we can't forget them.
That trace is you.

3383
05:21:53,849 --> 05:21:56,160
This morning when you
were checking the atlas,

3384
05:21:56,260 --> 05:21:58,870
you looked like him
when he was your age.

3385
05:21:59,150 --> 05:22:04,747
We checked an atlas too a long
time ago. We wanted to have a journey.

3386
05:22:05,670 --> 05:22:11,347
We wanted to go to a far away
place where there's only the sea.

3387
05:22:13,270 --> 05:22:16,660
- That place's name is Cape North.
- Where is it?

3388
05:22:20,510 --> 05:22:22,068
Over there.

3389
05:22:27,150 --> 05:22:32,144
- Did you reach it?
- I tried but I couldn't.

3390
05:22:32,270 --> 05:22:34,340
Your father wanted to,

3391
05:22:34,430 --> 05:22:37,979
but in the end he didn't.

3392
05:22:40,990 --> 05:22:43,345
The gods were calling him.

3393
05:22:45,230 --> 05:22:48,222
Yes, they were.

3394
05:23:15,630 --> 05:23:17,967
Why don't you stay
a few more days?

3395
05:23:18,067 --> 05:23:20,777
I can't, I have to leave tonight.

3396
05:23:21,230 --> 05:23:25,064
I need to check up
the kids tomorrow.

3397
05:23:25,190 --> 05:23:30,105
- But I don't want to leave.
- Then stay, I'll take you to France.

3398
05:23:30,230 --> 05:23:34,269
Or Greece or Africa. You can choose.

3399
05:23:34,390 --> 05:23:36,381
Choose!

3400
05:23:44,350 --> 05:23:49,060
- Shall we meet again in three years now?
- No.

3401
05:23:49,190 --> 05:23:51,750
It's good for me
to see you and Andrea.

3402
05:24:21,521 --> 05:24:25,205
SPRING OF 2000

3403
05:24:30,790 --> 05:24:34,863
- It's beautiful here.
- Beautiful? It's sublime!

3404
05:24:35,470 --> 05:24:40,225
- It's like heaven.
- We told him to buy a house here

3405
05:24:40,350 --> 05:24:45,299
- and he didn't want to...
- We had to insist!

3406
05:24:47,630 --> 05:24:52,704
- Look at that orchard! Is it new?
- Yes, there are palm-trees too.

3407
05:24:52,830 --> 05:24:56,789
- He put them in front of the house.
- But they're still small.

3408
05:24:58,190 --> 05:25:02,502
- You got rich with this project.
- What?

3409
05:25:02,630 --> 05:25:06,259
You never get rich
with your friends' money.

3410
05:25:06,390 --> 05:25:09,780
- I meant rich inside.
- That of course!

3411
05:25:09,910 --> 05:25:13,983
Giving without receiving...

3412
05:25:15,670 --> 05:25:19,629
They're making me crazy.
Your sister is worse than him.

3413
05:25:19,750 --> 05:25:24,949
Watch out when you
speak about my sister, or...!

3414
05:25:25,070 --> 05:25:29,461
She wants darker tiles
so they can match with...

3415
05:25:29,590 --> 05:25:34,186
- She's right.
- Very picky, though.

3416
05:25:34,310 --> 05:25:39,828
- Your car seems tired.
- It's old. Like us.

3417
05:25:40,310 --> 05:25:42,266
Carlo!

3418
05:25:44,590 --> 05:25:47,982
- Francesca?
- There's no one here.

3419
05:25:52,030 --> 05:25:53,986
Please notice...

3420
05:25:54,350 --> 05:25:58,582
- Notice that shape.
- It's an absolute wonder.

3421
05:26:00,750 --> 05:26:05,439
- The garden is my favourite.
- Look at that wonder...

3422
05:26:05,539 --> 05:26:06,804
Sara?

3423
05:26:07,548 --> 05:26:10,376
- So your daughter's getting married.
- Yes.

3424
05:26:12,270 --> 05:26:15,819
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

3425
05:26:16,110 --> 05:26:19,819
Did he ask
you for her hand?

3426
05:26:20,910 --> 05:26:24,903
Of course he did,
with respect too.

3427
05:26:25,030 --> 05:26:29,342
- I said yes because he's a good guy.
- Good.

3428
05:26:29,470 --> 05:26:33,429
- He should have his hair cut.
- You're right.

3429
05:26:33,550 --> 05:26:36,906
There's so much room!
That's great!

3430
05:26:37,030 --> 05:26:41,387
Look... great work
of a great artisan.

3431
05:26:41,790 --> 05:26:46,466
You remind me of Brunelleschi
or Leon Battista Alberti.

3432
05:26:48,510 --> 05:26:52,185
- Look.
- "One day all this will be yours."

3433
05:26:52,310 --> 05:26:55,287
- Thanks.
- Let's have a swim.

3434
05:26:56,047 --> 05:26:58,777
- A swim?
- Didn't you bring your bikini?

3435
05:26:58,867 --> 05:27:00,197
With this belly?

3436
05:27:00,230 --> 05:27:04,508
- Wear a one piece suit then.
- I only have a tanga, but it...

3437
05:27:27,190 --> 05:27:30,626
- I'm so glad you came here.
- We're happy too.

3438
05:27:31,070 --> 05:27:34,375
- This place is beautiful.
- In fact I wanted you to see it.

3439
05:27:35,821 --> 05:27:37,173
How are you?

3440
05:27:37,373 --> 05:27:40,651
- Fine thanks. How are you?
- Fine.

3441
05:27:41,070 --> 05:27:43,351
Are you happy that your
daughter is getting married?

3442
05:27:43,501 --> 05:27:45,290
Yes, very much.

3443
05:27:45,673 --> 05:27:48,790
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

3444
05:27:50,371 --> 05:27:51,684
Is everything okay?

3445
05:27:53,179 --> 05:27:55,412
- Yes.
- Good.

3446
05:28:01,011 --> 05:28:04,451
- I'll go to speak with your son.
- I'll leave you two alone.

3447
05:28:04,800 --> 05:28:06,197
- See you later.
- Yes.

3448
05:28:06,296 --> 05:28:08,154
- Bye.
- Bye.

3449
05:28:11,150 --> 05:28:13,106
<i>So?</i>

3450
05:28:16,990 --> 05:28:19,379
- How are you?
- Dunno.

3451
05:28:19,510 --> 05:28:22,946
Nice answer, short and concise.

3452
05:28:24,270 --> 05:28:29,219
- What's with that beard?
- Do I look good?

3453
05:28:29,350 --> 05:28:33,184
Does the girl you love like it?

3454
05:28:34,550 --> 05:28:38,099
- I don't know.
- Ask her.

3455
05:28:38,230 --> 05:28:40,221
What's she like?

3456
05:28:40,830 --> 05:28:43,583
- Is she pretty?
- Very much.

3457
05:28:43,710 --> 05:28:45,547
Did you tell her?

3458
05:28:45,835 --> 05:28:48,509
- It's not easy.
- I know.

3459
05:28:48,550 --> 05:28:51,303
You have to tell her all the same.

3460
05:28:51,430 --> 05:28:55,340
Tell her she's pretty,
and that you are as well.

3461
05:28:55,440 --> 05:28:56,908
What do you mean?

3462
05:28:56,990 --> 05:29:01,745
You are, we only have
to see if a beard fits you.

3463
05:29:01,870 --> 05:29:05,783
- Is she a witty girl?
- I don't think so.

3464
05:29:06,190 --> 05:29:09,546
- Let's switch to B plan then.
- Shall I jump on her?

3465
05:29:09,670 --> 05:29:14,186
Hey I can't say
that to my nephew!

3466
05:29:14,310 --> 05:29:18,098
- What's her name?
- Ermione.

3467
05:29:18,206 --> 05:29:20,412
- Ermione?
- Yes.

3468
05:29:20,950 --> 05:29:22,719
Then jump on her.

3469
05:29:22,790 --> 05:29:27,705
- I can't.
- I know.

3470
05:29:27,830 --> 05:29:31,106
- Let go of me!
- No way!

3471
05:29:39,110 --> 05:29:41,908
Here they are!

3472
05:29:42,805 --> 05:29:45,661
- Nice curls...
- Leave him be!

3473
05:29:45,761 --> 05:29:47,561
Okay, I will.

3474
05:29:48,670 --> 05:29:51,468
I have to talk to you.

3475
05:29:51,790 --> 05:29:53,746
Come.

3476
05:29:54,870 --> 05:29:56,861
What happened?

3477
05:29:57,870 --> 05:30:02,386
<i>Sara, my love, I've worked in a
Record Office in Florence for a while now.</i>

3478
05:30:02,510 --> 05:30:07,026
<i>A few days ago I found a
1966 newspaper with a picture.</i>

3479
05:30:07,150 --> 05:30:13,020
<i>I thought you'd like to see
the way your parents were.</i>

3480
05:30:13,150 --> 05:30:16,426
<i>We were two cheerful people
who wanted you very much.</i>

3481
05:30:16,550 --> 05:30:21,305
<i>All the sad things came later,
and it was never your fault.</i>

3482
05:30:21,670 --> 05:30:24,901
<i>I'm trying to start over.
Away from everyone.</i>

3483
05:30:25,030 --> 05:30:30,024
<i>I don't want to bother
anyone with my presence.</i>

3484
05:30:33,110 --> 05:30:35,101
I received it two days ago.

3485
05:30:41,270 --> 05:30:44,262
- Is that you with mom?
- Yes.

3486
05:30:45,110 --> 05:30:47,101
Florence, 1966.

3487
05:30:49,590 --> 05:30:51,706
What should I do?

3488
05:30:53,950 --> 05:30:56,339
It depends on
how strong you feel.

3489
05:30:57,070 --> 05:31:00,346
- Are you happy?
- Of course I am.

3490
05:31:02,590 --> 05:31:05,468
Then it's time
for you to be generous.

3491
05:31:08,670 --> 05:31:10,547
Bye.

3492
05:31:13,510 --> 05:31:16,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

3493
05:32:36,990 --> 05:32:38,218
Mom!

3494
05:32:39,750 --> 05:32:42,105
Giulia?

3495
05:33:10,350 --> 05:33:12,306
Mom...

3496
05:33:18,670 --> 05:33:23,460
- Mom, is there a bed in your place?
- There's mine, but it's small.

3497
05:33:23,790 --> 05:33:28,147
It doesn't matter,
I'd like to stay.

3498
05:33:28,274 --> 05:33:29,435
Okay.

3499
05:33:29,851 --> 05:33:32,721
- Hi, can you take a picture of us?
- Sure.

3500
05:33:35,750 --> 05:33:38,503
<i>Squeeze up.</i>

3501
05:33:38,830 --> 05:33:41,025
Good. Say "cheese".

3502
05:33:41,750 --> 05:33:44,344
- Done.
- Thanks.

3503
05:33:44,950 --> 05:33:48,147
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

3504
05:33:50,230 --> 05:33:55,145
Shall we look for something
nice for the new house?

3505
05:33:55,990 --> 05:33:58,220
We could go to...

3506
05:33:58,350 --> 05:34:01,979
There are many nice things here.

3507
05:34:02,110 --> 05:34:05,546
This could be a container
for bread, but I don't like it.

3508
05:34:05,670 --> 05:34:09,549
Those can be nice plates. No.

3509
05:34:09,670 --> 05:34:14,619
I want something special,
with more colours.

3510
05:34:16,310 --> 05:34:19,330
- What's that?
- It's a hat block.

3511
05:34:19,884 --> 05:34:22,361
- Can we have a look around?
- Of course.

3512
05:34:22,655 --> 05:34:24,146
Thanks.

3513
05:34:51,270 --> 05:34:54,865
That's the "Maestro" of
Santo Spirito. It was painted

3514
05:34:54,990 --> 05:34:59,905
by the sons of Domenico del
Mazziere, Agnolo and Donnino.

3515
05:35:00,030 --> 05:35:05,184
Donnino is more talented,
I think he painted the baby.

3516
05:35:05,310 --> 05:35:07,380
See how it...

3517
05:35:07,510 --> 05:35:12,300
This is wonderful, It's the "Maestro
della Conversazione" of Santo Spirito.

3518
05:35:12,430 --> 05:35:15,581
This is one of the best
works by Maso di Bianco.

3519
05:35:15,710 --> 05:35:19,180
It's my favourite work.

3520
05:35:19,310 --> 05:35:22,302
All those Madonnas with the Baby!

3521
05:35:23,590 --> 05:35:26,388
Why do you like them so much?

3522
05:35:29,270 --> 05:35:33,582
- Are you pregnant?
- I still haven't told anyone.

3523
05:35:39,990 --> 05:35:45,018
- What can I do for you?
- There is something.

3524
05:35:45,150 --> 05:35:48,142
- What?
- Play for me.

3525
05:35:48,950 --> 05:35:51,942
- Where?
- There's an organ here.

3526
05:35:53,430 --> 05:35:57,059
I haven't played
for so long... I can't do it.

3527
05:35:57,750 --> 05:36:02,028
And we're in a Church,
you need the authorisation.

3528
05:36:02,150 --> 05:36:04,948
Never mind then.

3529
05:36:05,950 --> 05:36:08,154
I only asked you for a thing

3530
05:36:08,254 --> 05:36:11,350
and you won't do it because
you need the authorisation.

3531
05:36:12,190 --> 05:36:17,184
You wanted to change the world
and now you need a permission to play.

3532
05:37:46,430 --> 05:37:50,105
Come on. Let's go to bed.

3533
05:37:55,670 --> 05:37:58,946
- Stirrup cup?
- No.

3534
05:37:59,070 --> 05:38:01,061
I'm in a coma.

3535
05:38:04,510 --> 05:38:06,501
I do not drink.

3536
05:38:13,030 --> 05:38:15,728
- Get up.
- Help me.

3537
05:38:15,829 --> 05:38:18,505
- Slowly.
- Careful.

3538
05:38:18,550 --> 05:38:21,542
- Careful.
- Slowly.

3539
05:38:21,670 --> 05:38:24,662
- Careful.
- Slowly.

3540
05:38:27,070 --> 05:38:29,026
Watch out!

3541
05:38:30,310 --> 05:38:34,303
- This way?
- No, that way.

3542
05:38:37,750 --> 05:38:40,548
By the way you...

3543
05:38:41,310 --> 05:38:44,905
...should understand something.

3544
05:38:45,670 --> 05:38:48,582
- Can I say it?
- Yes.

3545
05:38:50,310 --> 05:38:51,948
Then I'll say it.

3546
05:38:52,070 --> 05:38:56,507
Stop thinking of Matteo
as of an obstacle.

3547
05:38:56,630 --> 05:39:01,545
Otherwise you'll
end up hating him.

3548
05:39:03,270 --> 05:39:07,468
- What does that mean? Are you drunk?
- Yes. Goodnight.

3549
05:39:12,230 --> 05:39:14,061
However...

3550
05:39:17,510 --> 05:39:19,466
However.

3551
05:39:26,910 --> 05:39:30,983
<i>It's too dark!
Don't worry.</i>

3552
05:39:31,110 --> 05:39:35,069
<i>- There was a door here?
- You built this house.</i>

3553
05:39:46,590 --> 05:39:49,900
- So you won't come for the wedding?
- No.

3554
05:39:50,430 --> 05:39:52,785
I'll come to see you
when you have the baby.

3555
05:39:54,110 --> 05:39:55,710
- Promised?
- Yes.

3556
05:39:56,088 --> 05:39:56,898
Good.

3557
05:40:03,670 --> 05:40:05,661
Do you always wear those?

3558
05:40:05,790 --> 05:40:08,224
Sunglasses? Yes.

3559
05:40:09,910 --> 05:40:11,628
You're prettier
without them.

3560
05:40:13,390 --> 05:40:15,779
- Bye.
- Bye honey.

3561
05:40:54,630 --> 05:40:57,940
- Hi.
- Morning.

3562
05:41:10,350 --> 05:41:13,501
- Want some coffee?
- Yes please.

3563
05:41:20,830 --> 05:41:24,709
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes. Milk?

3564
05:41:26,390 --> 05:41:27,789
Yes.

3565
05:41:38,790 --> 05:41:42,180
- Did you sleep in your clothes?
- I didn't sleep.

3566
05:41:42,950 --> 05:41:46,226
- Something worries you?
- No.

3567
05:41:47,510 --> 05:41:50,308
- Sara, maybe?
- Not at all.

3568
05:44:31,510 --> 05:44:35,469
That day on the boat,
I wanted to kiss you.

3569
05:44:35,590 --> 05:44:37,546
Me too.

3570
05:44:45,697 --> 05:44:50,971
NORWAY - SPRING OF 2003

3571
05:45:12,590 --> 05:45:16,469
<i>Dear uncle. Or should I call you "dad"?</i>

3572
05:45:16,590 --> 05:45:20,265
<i>Dear Nicola,
we arrived at last!</i>

3573
05:45:21,910 --> 05:45:25,903
<i>I can almost recognise the places
you told me about when I was a child.</i>

3574
05:45:26,030 --> 05:45:29,022
<i>Maybe it's just my imagination.</i>

3575
05:45:41,310 --> 05:45:43,619
<i>It's good to do something
with the people you love,</i>

3576
05:45:43,750 --> 05:45:49,620
<i>even if sometimes I have
to do what Ermione wants.</i>

3577
05:45:49,750 --> 05:45:53,220
Why? Come here!
Where are you going?

3578
05:45:53,350 --> 05:45:56,820
Come on! Please come here.

3579
05:45:56,950 --> 05:46:00,989
<i>I convinced her to catch
a mail plane to Cape North.</i>

3580
05:46:01,110 --> 05:46:05,103
<i>She's scared but
we'll spare three days.</i>

3581
05:46:42,510 --> 05:46:46,219
<i>I look at the midnight
sun which goes down,</i>

3582
05:46:46,350 --> 05:46:49,023
<i>then stops without
sinking into the sea.</i>

3583
05:46:49,150 --> 05:46:52,620
<i>I think of my father,
of mom and you.</i>

3584
05:46:52,750 --> 05:46:57,187
<i>You always said that everything's
beautiful, and I think you're right.</i>

3585
05:46:57,310 --> 05:47:00,108
<i>Everything's really beautiful!</i>
