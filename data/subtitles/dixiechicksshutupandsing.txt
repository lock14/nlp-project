You can't go lower?

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,416
Easy!
Come play Mommy's guitar.

4
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,550
- You wanna play guitar?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,753
You wanna play?

6
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,759
"It's too bad, really.

7
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,567
I loved listening
to the Dixie Chicks.

8
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,300
I love their music.

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,932
Even this new
angry song is good."

10
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,505
Who is this?

Rightwingsparkle blog.

12
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,842
Sparkle!

13
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,180
"Country music is a 90%
Bush-supporting bunch.

14
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,118
These lamebrains
are talented, sure,

15
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,088
but they're sticking a finger
in the eye of their own customer."

16
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,647
"Dixie Chicks?
Are they still around?

17
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,921
I thought their 15 minutes
were up a long time ago."

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,325
Oh!

19
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,352
I'm not gonna
read the next line.

20
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,887
- Come on!
- No no no no...

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,422
- We don't get our feelings hurt.
- No no no no.

22
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,128
"Who are the Dixie Chicks,
anyway?

23
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,796
I mean, they're not like
an important band

24
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,363
where you know all their names,
like the Beatles.

25
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,376
The Dixie Chicks suck. They don't know
what they're talking about

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,934
and should
shut the fuck up."

27
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,667
It's easy for people
to feel a sense of anonymity

28
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,231
behind their computer

29
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,243
and write ugly things
and hateful things.

30
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,474
And, you know, a lot of that stuff
you don't take seriously,

31
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,245
but when somebody
hates you so much for what you say

32
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,548
that they want
to kill you...

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,220
I think if you walked
out on the street right now

34
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,528
and asked, "What did Natalie Maines
of the Dixie Chicks say?"

35
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,898
I don't believe that they would
know what I said.

36
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,697
But it is a part of...

37
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,572
who we are
as a band now,

38
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,135
whether we asked for it
or wanted it or like it.

39
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,077
I feel like...

40
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,380
people relate to us
because we're real.

41
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,410
And when you're real, you stick
your foot in your mouth sometimes.

42
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,184
People don't understand
how tight we are.

43
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,955
We're a sisterhood. We go through
the good, the bad and the ugly

44
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,693
all together.

45
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
Grammy Award winners,

46
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,238
the Dixie Chicks.

47
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,759
The Dixie Chicks
are returning to the road

48
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,991
on their
"Top of the World" tour

49
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,556
which kicks off in London
on March 10.

50
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,434
And after only three albums,
the Dixie Chicks

51
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,234
are now the best-selling
female group in history.

52
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,237
The Dixie Chicks' music

53
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,610
is rooted in tradition but,
just like the Dixie Chicks

54
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,844
are redefining the traditional
conventions of country music,

55
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,148
we're going to redefine tea
and serve it up in a way that's new,

56
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,781
full of energy and, frankly,
is really refreshing.

57
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,156
So, Lipton is proud to be
the official beverage sponsor

58
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:24,129
of the Dixie Chicks' 2003
"Top of the World" tour.

59
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,297
USA! USA! USA!

60
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,175
Go for it.

61
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,657
Hi, I'm Simon Renshaw.
I'm the Dixie Chicks' manager.

62
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,023
And I just thought
I'd take this opportunity

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,494
to say hello to all of you

64
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,121
and welcome you to the tour.

65
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,462
And we're looking forward
to a good one.

66
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,138
- Who's online?
- I am.

67
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,166
What's the war update?

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,802
Richard?

69
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,507
They're moving troops
but they haven't crossed yet.

70
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,181
Army units are now
moving into positions

71
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,551
at the border, battle-ready.

72
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,581
The feeling here--
war may be only hours away.

73
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,753
Calling them facts
and not assertions,

74
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,763
US Secretary of State
Colin Powell today

75
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,697
presented what
he says is evidence

76
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,860
that Iraq is hiding
weapons of mass destruction.

77
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,166
Simply stated, there is no doubt

78
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,901
that Saddam Hussein now has
weapons of mass destruction.

79
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,603
We know they have
weapons of mass destruction.

80
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,669
We know
they have active programs.

81
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,045
There-- there isn't
any debate about it.

82
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,017
The danger is clear.
Using chemical, biological

83
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,575
or, one day, nuclear weapons

84
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,280
obtained with the help of Iraq,

85
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,586
the terrorists could fulfill
their stated ambitions.

86
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,889
Saddam Hussein
and his sons

87
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,692
must leave Iraq
within 48 hours.

88
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,529
How's it looking?
Are you sure it's not too much?

89
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,035
- No.
- Hmm.

90
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,697
Okay, let's walk. We've gotta go.
Can I have someone take her baby?

91
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,264
Martie, we've gotta hit the stage.

92
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,300
- Martie, we've gotta go.
- Grab Martie, let's go.

93
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,744
Behind the growing buildup to war

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,544
there's also a growing
antiwar movement.

95
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,485
This may have been the biggest
political rally in UK history.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,956
Perhaps as many as a million people
converged on the center of London

97
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,721
to march and denounce
American plans for war.

98
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,821
You know what?
For a first show, it was awesome.

99
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,835
It was definitely
mission accomplished.

100
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,700
Audience loved it,

101
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,795
it looked great.

102
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,364
You know,
one down, 99 to go.

103
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,246
If you want to feel some good
old-fashioned American pride,

104
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,216
look no further than the uproar
over the Dixie Chicks.

105
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,379
And how they can say, 'I'm ashamed
that the president's from Texas'?

106
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,855
Come on, man. That's crazy.

107
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,381
The comment was quoted
by London newspaper "The Guardian."

108
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,918
In a matter of days, the London story
was picked up by the Associated Press

109
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,796
and printed in newspapers
all over the United States.

110
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,323
Personally, I hope
you don't play their music again

111
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,836
for quite a while.
I think that was very disrespectful.

112
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,305
Natalie's comment,
especially on foreign soil,

113
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,932
just was a slap in the face.

114
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,911
The American media is picking up
from the-- from the--

115
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,742
from the UK media,

116
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,772
you know, "Dixie Chicks diss
the President" kind of thing.

117
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,307
Everyone's calling.

118
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,081
Everyone's looking
for the statement.

119
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,352
And the area of concern is actually
what's coming out of country radio,

120
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,554
which is a far more
right-wing Conservative--

121
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,892
Really?

122
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,023
- Uh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,930
So what I just did was,
I just closed down

124
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,299
both the websites, all right?

125
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,928
- Oh my God!
- Hold on, hold on.

126
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,030
- Just let me--
- Was the chat room a part of it?

127
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,938
- Closed.
- Both of the chat rooms?

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,943
Yeah, so the idea is

129
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,104
we need to put a statement up
on the website.

130
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,444
And in terms
of the American media,

131
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,814
we need to have a statement
to release to the American media.

132
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,309
What if you just go
something like, you know,

133
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,652
"I apologize. We were

134
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,818
at a smoky bar gig
and I got a little carried away."

135
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,919
You know, play it down instead of...

136
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,589
But it's more serious than that.

137
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,258
- ..."This is what we really--"
- It is more serious than that.

138
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,996
But it was meant--
it was amidst kind of a joking thing.

139
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,403
But it was true. Here's

140
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,136
We have never been-- or "I"--
if y'all don't want to keep saying "we."

141
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,371
It should be "we."

142
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,903
- Sorry...
- Sorry, girls, but it should be "we."

143
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,848
Well, if anybody
asks me personally,

144
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,647
I'm gonna go, "Hey, I didn't say it.
Go talk to her."

145
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,313
Thanks for the support.

146
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,822
No, but I'm not
gonna try to dig you out.

147
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,620
I mean, I would end up saying
something totally wrong.

148
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,425
Like, I would like to say
that my comment was made...

149
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,591
In reference to--

150
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,693
...in reference to
the disappointment I feel--

151
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,500
- or the something I feel--
- Frustration.

152
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,134
--the frustration I feel
as an American citizen

153
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,837
for being ignored.

154
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,745
All right, so-- I mean, I don't think
that we should shy away

155
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,305
from controversy.

156
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,215
I mean, so-- I mean,
wouldn't it be great

157
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,516
if we could get them,
like, burning CDs

158
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,648
and banning you
from the radio...

159
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,552
We're gonna
boycott them for their music

160
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,189
and we're gonna boycott you for
playing it if you don't stop playing it.

161
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,495
Well, ma'am, that was
the last one you're gonna hear.

162
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,797
The Chicks' number-one hit
"Travelin' Soldier"

163
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,895
quickly fell from the top of the charts.

164
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,463
They had
the hottest song in the country.

165
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,634
All this stuff started, and it died.

166
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,012
We've never been a political band

167
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,021
and now we're thrown
into the middle of this

168
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,647
political whirlwind.

169
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,817
The radio station set up
these garbage cans

170
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,487
for people to come by
and throw out their CDs.

171
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,655
I liked them, you know,

172
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,494
but for what they said, it's trash.

173
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,864
They didn't only
whack "Traveling Soldier,"

174
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,931
they whacked all the play.

175
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,500
You've been really targeted
by a couple of groups out there.

176
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,239
I mean, you've been
really targeted.

177
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,946
American bombers
dropped a series

178
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,111
of 1000-lb bombs
on the compound.

179
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,951
Now who was the one
who talked about the war?

180
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,547
- Do you regret it?
- The thing is,

181
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,717
it wasn't even
a political statement.

182
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,388
It was a joke made
to get cheers and applause

183
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,591
and to entertain.
And it did.

184
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,759
But it didn't entertain America.

185
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,230
Some protestors
used a tractor and their feet

186
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,467
to smash the group's CDs.

187
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,701
Martie, have you
talked to Mom?

188
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,268
No. I left a message

189
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,110
and then I was sick all day
so I didn't call her again.

190
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,343
And I think that's all
she wants to hear from us--

191
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,443
is how much we know
it's affecting her.

192
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,512
The people who got it all started

193
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,753
was a right-wing group
called the Free Republic.

194
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,228
An extreme right-wing group
for their own political reasons

195
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,560
are attempting to manipulate
the American media,

196
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,156
and the American media
is falling for it.

197
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,691
The Free Republic
is very well organized.

198
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,795
There's definitely
a Free Republic hit list

199
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,363
with all of the radio stations
they're trying to affect.

200
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,466
And they are totally focused.

201
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,500
And the girls
are gonna get whacked.

202
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,603
Good morning.
61 Country.

203
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,273
They should send
Natalie over to Iraq,

204
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,148
strap her to a bomb
and just drop her over Baghdad.

205
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,642
A million things
have really pissed me off about it.

206
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,179
And I'm ready to go home
and set the record straight.

207
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,336
It's not about, necessarily,
our point of view.

208
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,704
The story's how out of hand
it's gotten, isn't it?

209
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,833
The-- the issue's not that--

210
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,073
what-- what has happened is
that the issue is not what was said.

211
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,080
It's how it's being reported

212
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,378
and how it's been turned
into something that it's not.

213
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,509
- It's snowballed.
- It's all about

214
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,951
you were not patriotic.
It's got

215
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,512
- nothing to do with what was said.
- We're not making excuses.

216
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,287
- We're not making excuses for beliefs.
- Because she didn't show support

217
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,351
- for the president.
- It doesn't matter--

218
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,693
- Support for the troops.
- It doesn't matter what was said.

219
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,221
- No, that's--
- But that's bullshit!

220
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,633
That's bullshit! Who has my statement?
They take what they want.

221
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,137
- Exactly!
- Correct. That's the point.

222
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,037
- I already said I'm patriotic.
- Absolutely.

223
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,938
- In my statement, I said I'm patriotic.
- Exactly.

224
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,964
In my statement,

225
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,534
- I said I support the troops.
- Exactly.

226
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,910
But I don't support the troops
and I'm not patriotic?

227
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,006
- Exactly, so...
- There you go.

228
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,040
- That's exactly it.
- That's it!

229
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,882
Look, hang on, let's start by looking
at some research,

230
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,446
because one of the things
that was very interesting

231
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,015
when Lipton brought
Michael's company in was--

232
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,651
Was Lipton about to pull out?

233
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,889
Uh, I think Lipton is concerned.

234
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,229
They are looking
for a reason to do it.

235
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,257
Everybody on the Lipton team

236
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,999
is saying, "Give us
a reason to go forward."

237
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,372
I think part of the reason that
they brought me to you guys

238
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,570
is to help you
manage through this,

239
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,306
because at the end of the day,

240
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,247
while you're great musicians,
you are a brand.

241
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,614
And if somehow your brand

242
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,449
is-- is-- now has
issues circulating around it,

243
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,751
you know, do they want
do take that sort of risk?

244
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,782
I-- I personally...

245
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,726
think we should
let Lipton off the hook,

246
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,252
saying, "We're backing out
because, you know,

247
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,992
we don't want
to hurt their product"

248
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,000
and that's it.

249
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,628
But that's a whole other story.
To me, that's-- that's what

250
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,535
- snowballs. We've been away.
- Right.

251
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,132
People have not been
able to see our faces,

252
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,609
hear our words. To me,
that is the greatest advantage

253
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,136
of doing an interview-- is that we--
I feel like we are endearing people.

254
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,308
- Absolutely.
- I feel like we will win people over

255
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,717
just by sitting there and looking--
saying honest things.

256
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,846
It's fine. I think this is better
for our career.

257
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,447
I think we've gotten more attention

258
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,355
than we ever were going to get.

259
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,622
We were never gonna be on the cover of
"Entertainment Weekly."

260
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,356
We were never gonna be interviewed
by Barbara Walters.

261
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,385
75% awareness?

262
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,795
We were never gonna have
these people...

263
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,890
It's insane.

264
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,458
...who never even knew who we were, care
to listen to our music, listen to it.

265
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,491
But hang on--

266
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,401
And that's fine. I think
when we apologize and we tell,

267
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,771
blah blah blah, then our fans--
and that will all be smoothed out

268
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,833
- and worked out. Do I believe--?
- I've got one thing--

269
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,142
- But I do think this could affect tea--
- Do it on your terms.

270
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,808
Don't-- you're
reacting to the reaction.

271
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,546
And all I'm saying is,
carry on as you want,

272
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,850
but do it on your terms.

273
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,958
I think people
are gonna say, "Oh my God!

274
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,963
What happened to them?"

275
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,160
- But they say "traitor," so...
- It's not we say about ourselves.

276
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,862
- It's what people have imposed on us.
- It's what you've been branded.

277
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,235
I-- I'm sorry.
I just-- I don't like--

278
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,799
that is going to be
so prominent on the cover

279
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,209
that my concern is
the average person isn't gonna get it.

280
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,374
They're gonna be horrified
when they see that.

281
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,782
It's not ridiculous
to call you opinionated.

282
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,581
It's not ridiculous
to call you brave.

283
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,748
Like, we've got
to show how cruel--

284
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,384
It's not ridiculous
to call you a big mouth.

285
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,291
No, that's true.

286
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,886
Truth hurts.

287
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,299
This is a brilliant artistic shot,

288
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,770
but just to see "Dixie Sluts"--

289
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,068
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

290
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,338
You need something
to counterbalance it--

291
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,074
"Proud American." Yes, they've
been branded, but I don't think--

292
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,514
I think you're giving too much credit
to the American public.

293
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,245
They're not that smart.

294
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,549
I don't think the average
person's gonna get any of it.

295
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,953
Then we're fucked,
if that's the case.

296
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,686
Don't-- I-- I'm not--
I'm not gonna go there.

297
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,092
This is about fixing it.

298
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,359
Well, that racy magazine cover

299
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,332
on the stands today
pretty much sums up

300
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,891
some of the names
the Dixie Chicks

301
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,869
are being called
in America these days--

302
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,600
"Traitors," "The Dixie Sluts,"
"Anti-American"--

303
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,699
all because of one
split-second comment

304
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,871
aimed at President Bush
right before the war with Iraq.

305
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,075
Maines says she was
just trying to fire back

306
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,346
when she shot
herself in the foot.

307
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,376
She apologized to the president,

308
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,615
but it only added fuel to the fire.

309
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,920
We've analyzed
the way that Diane Sawyer

310
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,757
and Chris Willman-- what they've done
in previous interviews,

311
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,229
and we'll give you
some examples.

312
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,198
Uh, it's likely to start

313
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,360
- with a real hard punch.
- Absolutely. It will.

314
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,269
You know, what you said
and why you said it--

315
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,432
you know, you don't rehearse
what you say in between songs,

316
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,669
and sometimes
it doesn't come out

317
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,405
the way that you intend it.

318
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,413
I'm not saying I support
their commander-in-chief,

319
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,039
but I'll say
I support the troops.

320
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,811
That-- that's fine.

321
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,613
But try-- try not
to be judgmental

322
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,279
of the president.
I'll tell you why:

323
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,515
He's got sky-high approval.

324
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,251
The war couldn't
be going better.

325
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,384
By the time
this interview airs,

326
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,224
he's likely to be
at the highest point.

327
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,321
Remember,
this is two weeks out.

328
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,424
The looting will be done.
The rebuilding of Iraq will be started.

329
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,265
Saddam Hussein will most likely
be dead or found out.

330
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,032
It-- I'm just telling you,
two weeks from now

331
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,235
it's gonna be even
a more positive situation.

332
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,300
Are you ashamed that the President
of the United States

333
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,810
is from your state?

334
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,938
No, I'm not truly embarrassed

335
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,346
that, you know, President Bush
is from my state.

336
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,715
That's not really
what I care about.

337
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,811
It was the wrong wording.

338
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,312
Am I sorry
I said that? Yes.

339
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,587
Am I sorry I spoke out? No.

340
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,753
But you can't tell me
that at no point

341
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,524
the two of you,

342
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,589
however much you love her,

343
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,897
however much you
understand her--

344
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,631
that you didn't say,

345
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,536
"Why did she do that?
Why did she do that?"

346
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,097
Why can't you say that?

347
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,336
Partially why our audience

348
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,812
has allowed us to get
to where we are today

349
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,613
is because they like her
the way she is.

350
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,152
Hi. Rudy Blair, 680-News.

351
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,179
I guess I'm gonna
have to be the evil one on this one.

352
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,419
I gotta ask,
how have things been going

353
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,825
since this whole
Bush controversy?

354
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,490
How are things going
for you guys now?

355
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,055
Our album sales
are definitely down

356
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,726
and we don't get
played on the radio.

357
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,100
We heard they've turned
what happened to us into a verb.

358
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,969
You can get
"Dixie-Chicked."

359
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,237
And if we had to be
the example, that's fine.

360
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,801
We don't want this
to be our legacy.

361
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,710
We want
our music to be our legacy.

362
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,012
And one positive with that is
it's sort of opened the door for us

363
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,348
to do anything musically
that we wanna do now

364
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,753
without feeling any pressures
that we have to please,

365
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,986
because we don't really
have anyone to answer to,

366
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,017
as far as radio
is concerned.

367
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,644
Oh yeah, baby.

368
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,585
That's a nice touch.

369
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,905
Doing good. We moved out to LA
just for a little while,

370
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,466
just for Emily
to have the babies

371
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,102
and us to write
some music and stuff.

372
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,548
Well, first of all, I think
there should be some "we's," like...

373
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,254
That's hilarious.

374
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,726
- Wouldn't kiss all the asses...
- Oh-ho-ho!

375
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,463
...that they told me to.

376
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,868
Is that good?

377
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,738
Gave a lot of blowjobs,
but wouldn't kiss all the asses?

378
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,777
'Cause you did
kiss some ass.

379
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,440
That's good.
I don't know if I could sing that,

380
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,609
but if you could,
more power to ya.

381
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,279
What-- what about,
"I fought with a stranger"?

382
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,016
- Fought with a stranger, yeah.
- Kinda like the stranger is Bush.

383
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,617
- It's not--
- Good, Emmie, good!

384
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,423
Big money, big money!

385
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,277
I mean, we've never been able to write
a whole album of songs.

386
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,303
And when you're
writing so much,

387
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,872
you start noticing just things
in your everyday life

388
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,474
that are worthy of a song.

389
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,783
And almost anything
that isn't written by us,

390
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,688
now, at least on this album,
seems a little bit false almost.

391
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,749
This record is, like you said,

392
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,818
our therapy, in a way.

393
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,386
This is what we wanna say.

394
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,686
- That sounded great.
- Yeah, come in.

395
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,295
How do y'all--
do y'all all write your songs?

396
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,268
Yeah. I mean,
we'll just get in the room

397
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,099
and we'll just jam and improvise.

398
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,867
And something will start
from a drumbeat or a bass line...

399
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,102
Does everyone write equally
on everything?

400
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,372
- No.
- But you split writing equally?

401
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,537
- Yep.
- Wow.

402
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,774
I wouldn't feel right if I was...

403
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,180
The guy doing all the--

404
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,979
...you know, the bass
player or whatever--

405
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,044
I wouldn't feel right taking
writing credit or money.

406
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,955
But he's smart to
keep them happy, in a way,

407
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,651
because band members

408
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,217
tend to start resenting
the lead singer no matter what

409
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,525
- because they get more attention--
- Oh, really?

410
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,260
No.

411
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,097
- In male bands.
- Female players--

412
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,898
I mean, band members...

413
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,235
But you know, it can breed--

414
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,399
But that's why bands
break up, because...

415
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,601
I think so too--

416
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,542
...the members of the band
start resenting that...

417
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,307
But I'm saying he--
this band could break up

418
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,610
because the lead singer resents.
That's what I'm saying.

419
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,377
It's a chemistry thing,
you know.

420
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,648
Well, he could go solo.
That's the thing that the lead singer

421
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,245
could hang over
the band's head.

422
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,256
Yeah.

423
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,937
You know why she
picked up the banjo?

424
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,169
Because we all played violin,

425
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,109
and I started playing fiddle

426
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,272
and I was really jealous
of her playing the fiddle,

427
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,406
because whatever I would do,
she would do better--

428
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,246
- like sports, whatever.
- Yeah.

429
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,616
And so when she
would play the fiddle,

430
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,349
I'd go in and I'd, like, beat her
over the head with my fiddle.

431
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,050
So you drove her
to the banjo.

432
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,926
So mean. So I was like, "You have to
pick another instrument."

433
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,759
Wow.

434
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,789
I don't know
why she picked the banjo.

435
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,767
It worked out good.
It's a good combo.

436
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,168
Yeah.

437
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,968
Oh, she was just--
oh, just that little sister

438
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,033
that just-- anything you did,
she just had to one-up ya.

439
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,158
Check check.

440
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,329
Did we do as long an intro on the real
version as we did the demo? Okay.

441
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,963
- Should we try one?
- Yeah.

442
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,336
All right, here we go.

443
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,176
- That's incredible.
- Thanks.

444
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,209
Now this-- do you wanna
know what this is about?

445
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,687
- Sure.
- It's about Lubbock, Texas.

446
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,418
I remember there was the line
about the statue.

447
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,687
- And Buddy Holly.
- Yeah.

448
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,992
They hated him
when he was a star

449
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,125
and they thought he was
evil and rock 'n' roll and,

450
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,499
- you know...
- It's Natalie's hometown too.

451
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,561
- And they basically turned--
- Oh, Lubbock?

452
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,402
--the whole city basically
turned on her,

453
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,772
and all the radio stations
were horrible and...

454
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,334
It's like Buddy Holly all over again.

455
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,952
Seems much more
ordinary right off the bat.

456
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,785
Yep.

457
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,387
This line...

458
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,397
Good change.

459
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,793
In this chorus, the melody is good.

460
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,571
The chords
and the melody are strong.

461
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,771
Do you not like the words?

462
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,473
It's worth pursuing

463
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,451
even though you don't like it.

464
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,353
But I would rewrite
all the words.

465
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,119
I think-- I think
the pre-chorus and chorus,

466
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,023
musically and melodically,
are really strong.

467
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,324
I'm just missing
a connection to the lyrics.

468
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,092
Just rewrite--

469
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,655
rewrite 'em for yourself.

470
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,167
Yeah, easy for you to say.

471
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,227
You rewrite. No I'm kidding.

472
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,704
Then you won't
feel a connection.

473
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,208
I'm still a little confused.

474
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,938
I'm still having
a hard time hearing,

475
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,505
like, our role
in some of the songs.

476
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,038
Because at the end
of the day,

477
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,607
you know,
what's best for the song

478
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,985
has to be best for the song.
It can't be a forced--

479
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,580
"Let's slap some
fiddle on there

480
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,818
just because I play the fiddle,"
you know?

481
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,451
I-- I--
at this point,

482
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,359
I-- my interest

483
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,728
is just any way
we can get great songs,

484
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,460
from any direction.

485
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,024
And then we'll
put it through

486
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,400
whatever the Dixie Chicks'
filter is gonna become,

487
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,031
which we'll see.
It'll-- it's gonna reveal itself

488
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,371
- as we work on the songs.
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,411
See, I'm nothing but
a glorified lackey...

490
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,082
waiting on her hand and foot.

491
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,552
"I can't believe
she made me carry this..."

492
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,688
Oh, sorry.

493
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,356
Uh, was that solo too country?

494
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,025
I like the nut choices.
I don't know if that would be one

495
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,466
- but it was good.
- I was just kinda--

496
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,698
That one sort of weird thing you did--
I wish it was more of that.

497
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,228
All right. Got it.

498
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,935
But everything you're doing
is awesome.

499
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,273
Quit sucking up.

500
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,523
We did a demo tape for Natalie

501
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,826
for her to get into Berklee
School of Music up in Boston.

502
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,823
And I was playing a gig with the Chicks
in Dallas or somewhere,

503
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,460
and I just gave 'em
a cassette.

504
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,438
You know, it wasn't really pitching her
at all. It was just like, "Hey,

505
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,771
check this out.
It's my daughter."

506
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,901
I think it was about a year
before they even heard it.

507
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,640
I mean, they kind of left it
in their motor home--

508
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,944
the pink motor home
that you hear about.

509
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,780
But, apparently, Martie and Emily must
have kept it in the back of their minds,

510
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,514
and when they decided to change
lead singers,

511
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,146
they called about Natalie.

512
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,965
That was an incredible
song, man.

513
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,057
Oh, good.

514
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,897
You just blew everybody
else off the record.

515
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,833
I was barely trying.

516
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,839
I met the Chicks in 1994.

517
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,307
There they were,
and they had their hair really big,

518
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,181
and they had
the hoop dresses on

519
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,345
and the spangles
and the cowboy hats.

520
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,413
And they went on stage
and they performed these songs

521
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,015
which were pretty bad--

522
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,083
basically, Western swing,

523
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,392
very old-fashioned,
very not contemporary.

524
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,091
But the one thing
that was very very clear

525
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,362
was that they were
three beautiful girls,

526
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,961
and incredibly talented,
and they could really play.

527
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:10,304
And if they had a willingness
to kind of like change direction,

528
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:14,402
moving more into a contemporary
country music space,

529
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,176
there actually could be a really
interesting slot for them.

530
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,810
We had to go out,
we had to find the right material

531
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,787
and we had to develop it
into something new.

532
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,189
But anytime
the girls say to me,

533
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,921
"You know what, Simon?
We can't believe

534
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,690
that you booked us here.

535
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,560
How could you have
let that happen?"

536
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,589
I go, "How could I
have let that happen?

537
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:39,433
Just remember
who booked this show"--

538
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,065
oh, yes.
This is 1996.

539
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,598
This is the Pillsbury Bake-Off.

540
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,441
And that's in the--
which department is this in?

541
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,710
Oh, that's the produce
department they're playing in--

542
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,651
a fantastic booking,
one that I had nothing to do with.

543
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,053
The girls handled this
all by themselves.

544
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,554
Could it be something about

545
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,360
maybe the fear of
losing that one person

546
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,765
that you know you can go to,

547
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,293
and sort of your salvation,

548
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,101
or your sanity?

549
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:20,842
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

550
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,973
I missed you!
I missed you.

551
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,950
He looks so big.
I haven't seen you in so long.

552
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,383
You look so different.

553
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,152
You look like more of a boy.

554
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,492
You look like you've been eating
nothing but ribs and Cheetos with Dada.

555
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,123
Gussie, what's in Mommy's belly?

556
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,565
What's in Mom--
What's in Mommy's tummy?

557
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,069
- Whales.
- Whales.

558
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,230
- Two of 'em!
- Whales!

559
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,331
No, Mommy's as big as a whale.

560
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,638
Take it-- yeah, I'm--
he calls me "Shamu."

561
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,473
Is there a baby in there?

562
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,003
Are there babies--
are there babies in there?

563
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,243
- What about babies?
- What about babies?

564
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,842
I love you.

565
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,588
- So how you feeling?
- Uh, just ready.

566
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,323
- Soon.
- Very ready.

567
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,161
All right, guys.
This is-- whoo!

568
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,860
- There.
- Scariness.

569
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,459
Let's go peek.

570
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,831
I think--
obviously, before we got married,

571
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,670
we knew we wanted children.

572
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,109
But then, you know, all of a sudden,
we start trying,

573
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,613
and nothing's happening.

574
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,047
You know, you start to get
a little nervous.

575
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,780
It was about two and a half years
of just nothing,

576
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,152
and going through
fertility treatments--

577
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,714
everything from
artificial insemination

578
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,386
all the way to what eventually
ended up being in vitro.

579
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,520
Tell me if something hurts.

580
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,271
- Does that work?
- Sorry, I went to the wrong note.

581
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,010
My sister and I both
went through in vitro.

582
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,347
Emily started trying
first and,

583
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,843
oh, I watched her do it all.
And it just went on and on.

584
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,755
It's an expensive process.
It's hard on your body

585
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,554
with all the hormones,
all the injections.

586
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:19,620
You have to take a lot of drugs
and alter your cycle,

587
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,633
alter your chemistry
in a lot of ways.

588
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,862
- And it's a huge deal.
- Yeah, but we just assumed

589
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,234
that we would get pregnant
straightaway.

590
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,795
- We were like, "Okay..."
- Yeah,

591
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,502
but when Emily started having problems,
I started thinking

592
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,237
it could happen to us.

593
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,010
But we were
very lucky, very fortunate.

594
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,181
We just did in vitro
and it worked.

595
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,453
Hi!

596
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,620
We knew there was a 30% chance
of having twins.

597
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,131
We went in
and he did the sonogram and,

598
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,135
just very nonchalant and calm,
just goes,

599
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,603
"Well, there's the heartbeat."
And we were all excited.

600
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,630
And then he moved it over and said,
"And there's the other one."

601
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,201
And Gareth and I
just... screamed.

602
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,678
He said,
"Don't scream, don't scream,"

603
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,374
like I was gonna
hurt the baby.

604
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,794
Okay, how's she feeling?

605
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,433
She's comfortable.
She's had her epidural.

606
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,933
And her contractions are moving,
you know, slowly along.

607
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,242
There's not much progression.

608
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,442
- There's not much going on.
- Does she want magazines?

609
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,543
Does she have the "US Weekly"
with Brad and Angelina?

610
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,178
They're on.

611
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,959
Oh, there's you. I was like,
"God, that looks like Natalie."

612
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,625
Ew, I was hoping
that didn't wind up...

613
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,191
Why? You look good.

614
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,068
And Emily looks
skinnier than me.

615
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,131
Emily could use a little eye makeup.

616
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,039
I could use a lot of everything.

617
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,873
Oh, ew!

618
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,141
Ew!

619
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,205
Look how big my boobs look.

620
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,012
They've done something.

621
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,645
- Bill Maher's tomorrow night, right?
- Yep.

622
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,917
But Bill Maher has been
pissing me off.

623
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,617
- I know. He is so--
- Unfortunately,

624
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,420
I agree with him.
I'd rather--

625
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,053
- See, I don't.
- I'd rather it go well in Iraq

626
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,585
and then they be right...

627
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,564
No, I know that,
but let's back up

628
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,193
to "We should not be there."

629
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,726
Of course, now that we're there--
yes, make the best of it.

630
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,397
But we should not be there.

631
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,964
It was still such lies
and bullshit.

632
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,600
She's having a baby, by the way.

633
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,838
The kids are, like, listening
to what we're talking about.

634
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,608
It's like, "I ain't fucking
going out there."

635
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,392
Oh...
Oh, two of 'em.

636
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,224
What am I gonna do with two?

637
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,662
Sore nipples are on the way.

638
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,273
They are so beautiful.

639
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,693
Say, "We squeezed before,
we can squeeze again," right?

640
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,338
I think now that we're
making music again,

641
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,503
I'd really be sad

642
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,877
if this didn't have--

643
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,712
- if it didn't get heard...
- An audience.

644
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,016
...and we couldn't continue our careers
effortlessly as we have in the past.

645
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,852
I mean, it's just been
a way of life, part of our life.

646
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,417
Emily and I started in a band
when we were very young.

647
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,621
I started when I was 12,

648
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,028
and then she joined the band I was in
when she was 10.

649
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,760
And the Dixie Chicks started
in 1989.

650
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,133
I mean, this is
more than just a job.

651
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,231
This is a lifestyle.
It's-- it's part of our lives.

652
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,209
So I think-- just recently

653
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,575
I've thought,

654
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,480
"God, I just really hope we can
get our career back on track.

655
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,108
'Cause I need it."

656
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,913
I thought it was probably
a good idea

657
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,455
for us to start
talking about

658
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,017
what a schedule might look like
for the next couple of years.

659
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,221
What's your strategy on,

660
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,730
like, wooing MTV
and VH1 and...?

661
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,859
VH1 will-- VH1 will gladly
air your videos.

662
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,926
MTV's not your--
you're outside--

663
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,870
you're too old for
where MTV is at.

664
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,736
We're too old?

665
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,605
You're just too old.

666
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,576
Even if we get cool,
we're too old already?

667
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,044
You're still too old already.

668
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,071
Can't I-- can't I sort of
lead them?

669
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,276
- I'm not old yet.
- Hey, you're 30 now.

670
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,718
- You're in the same bracket.
- You're too old.

671
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,845
Shit.

672
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,356
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure yet

673
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,587
what method we're using
to get music out there.

674
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,458
- I mean, the traditional--
- You don't want a single

675
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,759
- before the end of the year?
- Well, the traditional method is--

676
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,926
is you take a cut off the album
and you service it to radio.

677
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,731
Right? But we've got to
assume right now

678
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,933
that, you know, we're not dealing
with the country format.

679
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:06,340
I think you still
let Sony do what they want there.

680
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,538
- We just aren't involved.
- I don't. I don't.

681
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,740
You release the single;

682
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,875
they play it;
the campaign starts up again--

683
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,886
"I'm never listening
to your station";

684
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,115
it's plummets to
"We want that"

685
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,918
before our album comes out.

686
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,120
I didn't mean for us to do anything
for country. I just thought--

687
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,958
I am just not willing
to work country radio

688
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,328
because I think it's
gonna be a huge disaster.

689
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,698
- And we shouldn't.
- I don't think we should, either.

690
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,636
But having said that,
if country radio embraced it

691
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,696
and turned around,
and all of a sudden

692
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,799
you're sitting in number one
on country radio,

693
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,970
I think it would be crazy
not to go back and go,

694
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,639
- "We're glad you like the new record."
- Water under the bridge.

695
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,410
So we're all gonna be
friends again now.

696
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,713
We're gonna have to deal
with some more redneck bullshit.

697
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,744
But I think it's at a point
where you cannot go back

698
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,019
and put yourself
in the crosshairs.

699
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,926
Be proud of your
country. Be ashamed of the Dixie Chicks.

700
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,331
The controversy from the
country music world has landed tonight.

701
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,000
The Dixie Chicks
launched the US leg

702
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,033
of their "Top of the World" tour
in Greenville, South Carolina.

703
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,672
They're ignorant, and they don't
know what they're talking about.

704
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,182
If you support the Dixie Chicks,
you're supporting communism.

705
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,478
You're supporting traitors.

706
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,918
We're tired
of the anti-American voices.

707
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,682
We're tired
of the antiwar voices.

708
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,850
Tickets for the Dixie Chicks
concert went on sale months ago.

709
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,986
We did buy the tickets
before they said these things.

710
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,394
We couldn't get our money back,
so that's why we're here.

711
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,025
But these South Carolina fans
had no idea

712
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,365
that the show they were paying to see
would end up becoming

713
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,371
much more than a concert.

714
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,499
I think we in South Carolina ought
to say goodbye to the Dixie Chicks,

715
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,875
and anybody going to that concert
ought to be ready to run away from it.

716
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,140
God Bless GW!

717
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,944
When Natalie Maines made
her comments on the eve of war,

718
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,280
most of us recognized
that was reprehensible.

719
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,185
It hurt our men fighting overseas
who think their cause is just.

720
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,418
Is this a matter
of free speech or bad manners?

721
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,891
Their opinion is so ignorant.

722
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,621
They don't know what
they're talking about.

723
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,926
I think they are the Ditzy Twits.
These are the dumbest,

724
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,728
dumbest bimbos, with due respect,
I have seen...

725
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,167
These are callow, foolish women
who deserved to be slapped around.

726
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,898
Absolutely.

727
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,304
The Bi-Lo Center is working
with Greenville police

728
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,275
to provide extra security
surrounding the Dixie Chicks concert.

729
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,471
Sit.

730
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,139
Bomb-sniffing dog.

731
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,116
I mean, the Dixie Chicks
are free to speak their mind.

732
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,142
They can say what
they want to say.

733
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,587
And just because-- they shouldn't
have their feelings hurt just because

734
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,524
some people don't wanna buy
their records when they speak out.

735
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,959
You know,
freedom is a two-way street.

736
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,122
"They shouldn't have
their feelings hurt"?

737
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,997
What a dumb fuck.
You're a dumb fuck.

738
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,831
Of course, everyone anxious
to find out here what happens

739
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,271
when the Dixie Chicks go before
a live audience for the first time.

740
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,898
14,000 Dixie Chicks fans
ready to go.

741
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,637
It feels real good.

742
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,984
Deafening cheers and a standing ovation

743
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,548
greeted the Dixie Chicks as they
opened their first US tour

744
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,822
since Maines made her
controversial comment.

745
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,853
The down-home greeting came
just as President Bush

746
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,661
addressed the nation
aboard the USS Lincoln.

747
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,463
America is grateful

748
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,027
for a job well done.

749
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,506
They said you might not come,

750
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,946
but we knew you'd come.

751
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,618
Because we have the greatest fans

752
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,647
in the whole world.

753
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,354
Oh wait, I hear some boos.

754
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,884
We have a plan for this.

755
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,626
If you're hearing a boo,
we welcome that...

756
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,066
because we welcome
freedom of speech.

757
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,799
So we're gonna give you
15 seconds

758
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,273
to get whatever you have out.

759
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,004
So here we go,
on the count of three,

760
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,239
you can start your booing.

761
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,716
One, two, three.

762
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,570
- Ladies...
- Was there boos at the end?

763
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,869
...that was fucking brilliant.

764
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,570
- It was. It felt like...
- Oh, it was brilliant.

765
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,772
Oh, that was brilliant.

766
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,678
All the media people

767
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,377
are just like, "Oh--" I mean--

768
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,579
- Simon, you're our manager. Shut up.
- Okay. Sorry.

769
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,248
This sucked, actually.
It was really fucking lame.

770
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,416
Whoo!

771
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,863
Cheers, you guys.

772
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,829
So being the pain in the ass

773
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,336
that I am,

774
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,669
we've gotta do a little
radio thing now,

775
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,800
- so...
- Aw, come on!

776
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,504
But what made it tough
was it wasn't your normal call,

777
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,673
"I wish you wouldn't play that song,"
or "I don't really like what you did."

778
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,206
It was, "I will never listen
to you again.

779
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,152
I will drive to the station.
I will," you know,

780
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,677
short of threats, to us,

781
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,089
it was like, "I will never
listen again." That was just weird.

782
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,387
We have this audience,

783
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,419
and we wave
that country flag all the time,

784
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,624
defend country music,

785
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,792
and in an instant,

786
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,426
they turned
their backs on us.

787
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,960
No, I mean, you being the biggest
ambassadors for country radio.

788
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,439
No bullshit, how do
you all feel about country radio?

789
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,374
The people who abandoned us,

790
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,639
I'll never talk to them again.

791
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,942
And the people who've
supported us are gonna

792
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,448
get more love
than they've ever seen.

793
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,055
Can you say, "Hi"?
Say "Aghhh!"

794
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,791
- Sneak attack!
- Aggh! You scared me.

795
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,771
Freedom of speech is fine,
but by God, you don't do it outside

796
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,003
of the country, and you don't
do it in mass public place.

797
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,672
"Being ashamed of our president

798
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,375
means being ashamed
of our country.

799
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,213
Move to France, Dixie Chicks."

800
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,843
Screw 'em!

801
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,014
Right? Say it.

802
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,689
Did Simon tell you all
the American Red Cross

803
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,859
wouldn't take a million dollars
from us?

804
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,892
Well, you do know
that George W Bush

805
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,665
is the honorary chairman.

806
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,605
This whole week they didn't play us.

807
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,870
- This whole week they didn't play us.
- That's one song.

808
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,877
- No one boycotted you.
- This is a boycott.

809
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,776
- That one did.
- That is not a boycott.

810
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:26,305
How is it not a boycott? They haven't
been playing our music for a few weeks.

811
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,150
A boycott is when someone says,
"We are not playing--"

812
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,246
Simon, actions speak louder
than words.

813
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,052
What's the difference?
You tell me the difference.

814
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,795
All I know is all these radio stations,
they pretend to support 'em,

815
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,892
but they won't play 'em.
We call and ask, and they won't.

816
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,199
No other artist that we play
on the radio

817
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,728
would get the kind of hate mail
and complaint calls,

818
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:53,140
and "I'm never listening to you again.
I'm never doing business with you."

819
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,772
No one gets that. I could probably put
Marilyn Manson on the radio station

820
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,180
and not get that kind
of negative feedback,

821
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,081
even though we're
a country station.

822
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,211
These people
haven't "boycotted" us,

823
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,153
but they haven't been playing
our song

824
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,716
and are partially responsible
for our number-one single to plummet.

825
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,091
I'm just trying to find
some medium ground here.

826
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,063
- Ignore it.
- It's up to them to do the right thing.

827
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,588
We have not done anything wrong,
and there's nothing

828
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,328
- for us to climb back from.
- I agree.

829
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,944
- Where are our record sales?
- Near the shitter.

830
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,040
- How much?
- Right now you're down to 56

831
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,381
on the top 200.
But yet--

832
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,013
- Is that the lowest ever?
- Yeah.

833
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,785
I think time's
the greatest healer of all.

834
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:44,385
Listen, they'll give Tracy Lawrence,
who's a wife beater, another shot.

835
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,259
I don't want another shot.

836
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,225
Until the mood of our
audience changes,

837
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,361
we're not going
to play them anymore.

838
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,837
It'd simply be financial suicide.

839
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,273
Keep playing, keep making music.

840
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,799
And keep your mouth shut.

841
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,744
Now that we've, you know,

842
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:06,340
fucked ourselves anyway,
I think we have a responsibility

843
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,181
to continue to fuck ourselves.

844
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,658
I am so-- I just-- the rest of our
career just better not be overanalyzed

845
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,826
like this because of this
one episode.

846
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,797
USA! USA!

847
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,536
USA!

848
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,457
I almost started crying
out there tonight.

849
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,050
Why?

850
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,357
All these people
in this huge arena,

851
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,921
and I thought,
are we ever gonna be

852
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:57,058
at this level again?

853
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,830
It made me so sad.
I thought,

854
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,838
"Is this the top,

855
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,171
you know, and everything's
downhill from here?"

856
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,174
Today's country, KJ97.
Good morning.

857
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,680
It's Randy Carroll and Pam Tyler.
It's 8:54.

858
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,808
Their career is a lot bigger

859
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,910
than the country music core.

860
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,081
Now as a radio station,

861
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,091
we can't afford
to lose the country music core.

862
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,719
As entertainers,
they obviously feel like they can,

863
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,820
and I think that's probably the thing

864
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,888
that bugs me the most
about the whole thing--

865
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,594
not so much what they say,

866
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,763
but in the things that they've said.
And several different things,

867
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,898
not just the comment
about the president,

868
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,341
but some of the things that
they said about Toby Keith's music

869
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:44,336
and about him
and people that believe that way

870
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,975
shows a real contempt

871
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,644
for what a whole lot

872
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,051
of country-music listeners
believe.

873
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,580
I just have a quick question regarding
things that have been happening

874
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,718
with Toby Keith lately.
He was in town a couple of weeks ago

875
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,229
with a little bit of a video
poking fun at you.

876
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,232
What are you thoughts on that?
Is it all just in fun,

877
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,791
or is there any seriousness
to what's going on?

878
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,636
It's not in fun for me.

879
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,404
I don't appreciate
what he does in his show

880
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:17,402
with my picture,
and he has not been banned for that.

881
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,526
You have had a famous feud,

882
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,830
and does it bother you
that you are sometimes linked

883
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,497
with this simple-minded redneck?

884
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,336
And by that, I mean George Bush.

885
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,808
You're getting us in a lot
of trouble, Bill.

886
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,176
- I don't think we can get in more.
- What is the status of that feud?

887
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,424
You don't mind if I wear a shirt
that says "Fuck Toby Keith"?

888
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,361
I think it's cool.

889
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,355
I bet you $1,000 that you
won't wear a T-shirt that says,

890
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,334
"Fuck you, Toby Keith"
in three-inch--

891
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,997
I should wear a T-shirt
that says "I love Toby."

892
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,336
"I love TK."

893
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,808
"FCTK."

894
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,334
Ooooh!

895
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,313
- What is that?
- FUTK.

896
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,475
What does that mean?

897
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,485
Fuck you, Toby Keith.

898
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,817
And then when people ask
about it, what's the line?

899
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,416
Use your imagination.

900
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,189
It means something different
to everyone.

901
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,025
I'm gonna do that.
That's so safe.

902
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:43,965
Fans United Together
in Kindness.

903
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,231
Personally, I wish they
would just shut up and sing.

904
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,068
About the time
things start dying down,

905
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,042
somebody else says
something stupid

906
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,067
and gets everybody
all riled up again.

907
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,545
Dixie Chicks rule!

908
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,244
Fuck you, T.K.!

909
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,948
F.U.T.K.!

910
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:10,016
My shirt means "Freedom,
Unity, Truth, Knowledge."

911
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,552
Oh sure, it says "FUDC." You can infer
whatever you want from that.

912
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,121
I don't know what it means.

913
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,690
I'd say it's "Freedom
for the United States

914
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,635
which is a Democratic Country."

915
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,751
You see that person
shaking their sign with so much energy

916
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,553
- that said "FUDC"?
- Yeah.

917
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,753
- You should have said--
- I almost said--

918
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,625
"Hey, that's not nice
of you, crowd."

919
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,598
"We love you all's signs, but what
do you have against Dick Cheney?"

920
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,565
The Committee
continues its series of hearings

921
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,662
examining media ownership
by returning to the topic

922
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,765
that started it all-- radio.

923
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,708
As a result of statements made

924
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,574
by members of the Dixie Chicks
at a concert,

925
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,308
two radio networks--
Cox and Cumulus--

926
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,715
banned the Dixie Chicks
from their playlist at a chain level.

927
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,742
Mr. Chairman, first of all,

928
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,221
Mr. Renshaw refers to our
radio companies as networks

929
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,315
and we are not networks.

930
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,260
We are a confederation of 270
individual stations in 55 cities--

931
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,958
You made a decision
from corporate headquarters

932
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,901
that was binding on--
on your DJs.

933
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,904
- Mr. Chairman--
- And just prior to that,

934
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:05,271
you said that you are a group
of independent radio stations.

935
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,674
See, that's a total contradiction,
Mr. Dickey.

936
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,804
I think that mischaracterizes it.
As I mentioned,

937
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,178
this was a collaborative
decision-making process.

938
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,978
Everybody fell in line.
This was not--

939
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,212
this was a unanimous
overwhelming decision.

940
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,084
"Fell in line,"
I understand this.

941
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,147
Do you think what you did
sent any type of a chilling message

942
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,625
to people
that they oughta shut up...

943
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,185
and not express their views
one way or other?

944
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,526
- I would hope not.
- Okay.

945
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,556
Let me conclude--

946
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:36,002
Mr. Renshaw, do you think
that program directors

947
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,635
ever have the right to select
the programming

948
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,373
based on the actions,
activities

949
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,940
or public statements
of the entertainers?

950
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,315
I believe that they have the right
to make the decisions

951
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,446
about whether they do play something
or they don't play something.

952
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,049
But I think that what we were seeing
that was going on at the time

953
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,150
was people were
making decisions

954
00:54:57,193 --> 00:55:01,289
in a politically-censuring mode,
despite what everyone says.

955
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,027
Not very many managers
would be so brave.

956
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:08,094
They had-- they had unwittingly
entered into the world of politics.

957
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,301
It just seems to
me that when people get into politics,

958
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,901
even if they're entertainers,
it has consequences.

959
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:17,504
She made a decision,
politically, to speak.

960
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,538
It had a business
consequence to her.

961
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:23,541
And I think entertainers,
increasingly after this conflict,

962
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,316
are now recognizing
that their involvement in politics

963
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,053
does have a political fallout
in terms of business to them.

964
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,397
Oooh, did you see that?

965
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,767
If we give VH1-- if we're
doing the VH1 thing,

966
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,295
and we give them the remixed
version of "Top of the World"--

967
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,401
- Yes.
- Can we give CMT

968
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,309
simultaneously

969
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,146
- the country version?
- Why are we beating a dead horse?

970
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,778
- CMT viewers, I don't think, want--
- Well, that's--

971
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,755
I don't think we should penalize--
if they want to try--

972
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,781
penalize CMT when they have
done nothing but stand by us.

973
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,284
I don't want to be in a market and
industry that doesn't want us right now.

974
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:10,891
I just feel like...
"Let country music rest."

975
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,926
- Just not wanting to go--
- We're not going to the CMAs.

976
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,938
- We're not--
- You're not?!

977
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,873
So, uh--

978
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,502
You mean we can't-- uh...

979
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,843
So I'm just gonna tell them,
"No, pass. Forget it. We're over it.

980
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,339
- See you in a couple of years."
- Maybe.

981
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,479
Well, "Whether you like it or not
is gonna be irrelevant,

982
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,490
but we'll see you
in a couple of years with something."

983
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:38,051
- Maybe.
- You may never make another record?

984
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,858
- It may not be a country record.
- Oh, I know that.

985
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,592
- It works--
- It could be.

986
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,395
I'm assuming
that it-- that--

987
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:48,564
I'm assuming there will be
another record at some point. All right.

988
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,836
Yeah, but they're not--
anyway, we can argue about it

989
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,536
- in two years.
- Yes, oh yeah.

990
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,286
Here we go.

991
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,064
I'm probably
totally outnumbered,

992
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,402
but I think this is a country record
in a lot of ways.

993
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,840
Knowing country
through and through

994
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:30,107
because that's what I listened to,
you know, most of my life,

995
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,273
I don't think this is that far...

996
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:34,215
- I don't think so.
- ...from country

997
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,048
There are songs like "Lubbock"
where it's hardly kind of country,

998
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,849
but it's kind of like--
I don't know,

999
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,379
I really haven't heard
a band that sounds like that.

1000
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,224
The last thing I wanted to do
was for Rick to come in

1001
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,786
and say, "Okay,
we're making a rock record."

1002
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,356
That would've scared
the crap out of me.

1003
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,233
He hears something different,
Natalie hears something different,

1004
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,897
Emily hears something different,
I hear something different,

1005
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,908
but to me this is reminiscent
of the country I grew up on

1006
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,603
which is why I love it.

1007
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,522
I feel like
I just decompress

1008
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,618
the second I go through the gate.

1009
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,289
It's just like I can just relax,
you know?

1010
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,459
Being on the road's one thing,
but LA is a whole other thing.

1011
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,061
It's just not my cup of tea.

1012
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,670
I don't understand
how people can live

1013
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,615
in a place like Los Angeles.

1014
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,778
When I'm out there visiting her,
I'm just pissed off the whole time.

1015
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,813
He is-- he's literally pissed off
the whole time. I'm like, "Go home."

1016
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:53,285
I've always been able
to separate work and family

1017
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,492
and I've never had to do that
as long as I have this time

1018
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,696
with this project, you know?
I've never had to relocate.

1019
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,500
It was a hard year.
You know, being split up like that,

1020
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,635
especially, you know--
with our son being two and a half.

1021
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,475
Yeah, he'd get to fly back
and be with Dad for a week,

1022
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,777
but for a two-and-a-half-year-old
to conceptualize,

1023
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,375
"Why aren't you together?"
That was really hard.

1024
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,648
Hey, Mommy.

1025
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,986
Stop.

1026
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,493
- He's pretty good.
- Gimme.

1027
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,556
- Got him!
- Shoot.

1028
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,340
Dance in circles,
do your hands--

1029
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,505
Where's jazz hands?

1030
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,885
I don't know
too many women who get to bring

1031
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,717
their husband
and two children to work.

1032
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,918
Yummy yummy?

1033
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:59,156
I'm so lucky. My husband
travels everywhere with me.

1034
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,755
He's like a Mr. Mom
and he loves being a dad

1035
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,995
- and travels on every tour.
- I love being there for her

1036
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,002
when she comes in in the evening
from the studio.

1037
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,266
You know, the babies
are there and I'm there.

1038
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,705
Dinner's on the table--
sometimes.

1039
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,572
And uh, you know,
it's-- it's good.

1040
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,475
It really is, it's great.

1041
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,776
No matter where we are, as long as
we're together, I feel like we're home.

1042
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,512
Happy Halloween.

1043
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:26,989
- I don't want it, I don't want it.
- We'll do it loose.

1044
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,082
- Huh-uh, huh-uh.
- Do it. Watch.

1045
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,992
If you don't like it,
we'll take it off.

1046
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,622
Trust me, man.
I have to wear one all the time.

1047
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,928
You know, Daddy plays lawyers.
It's all I do.

1048
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,695
Look at me--
do I look like a lawyer?

1049
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,033
It's the tie--
it fools everyone.

1050
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:45,564
Aw, it's so cute though.
Girls are suckers for boys in ties.

1051
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,803
- I don't want my tie.
- Hey, you know what, buddy?

1052
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:52,406
I don't blame you.
Ties suck.

1053
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,383
Who wants to tie a noose
around their neck?

1054
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,943
This is basically like this.
So in corporate America you go,

1055
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,454
"Come on. Let's go. Come on.

1056
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,287
Come on, come on. Another couple
hundred million dollars.

1057
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,817
Come on, come on." This is how
they walk around the halls at Exxon.

1058
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,228
Just like this. Come on, let's go,
come on, chop-chop.

1059
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:10,528
Okay, so I don't blame you.

1060
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,295
You don't have to wear it.

1061
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,071
What else do we need?

1062
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,539
Oh!

1063
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:22,271
You're beautiful.

1064
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,676
Look at Kathleen.

1065
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,739
Beautiful.
I think we're ready.

1066
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:31,284
- Happy Halloween!
- Hey, you ready, Harry?

1067
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,413
- This.
- Mama, look, a graveyard.

1068
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,447
I know.
Look at that scary guy.

1069
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:39,120
Where is Kathleen?

1070
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,654
- Ta-dah!
- Dah!

1071
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,794
I feel like I've aged
five years

1072
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,737
since I had my twins.

1073
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,138
I just look in the mirror
and think I look so old,

1074
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,040
and the other morning
I was so tired.

1075
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,376
When you're just so tired, you'd give
anything not to have to get up.

1076
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,280
I offered Adrian a thousand bucks to get
up once, and he didn't do it.

1077
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,443
A thousand...

1078
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,817
I was like,
"I'll give you $1000."

1079
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,185
I was so serious.

1080
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,850
What does that mean
to the person you're married to, though?

1081
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,950
What's it mean
that he didn't get up?

1082
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,793
In our world,
okay, we give you a blowjob.

1083
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,857
"All right, you have to give me a
blowjob." I was like, "No, I'll do it."

1084
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,336
"I'll get up.
Never mind.

1085
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,736
You drive a hard bargain."

1086
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,098
We need to find
a way of introducing people

1087
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,262
to the new sound on the new album,
and I think we go out

1088
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,931
and we do four shows.

1089
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,203
I think we should go
and play in LA,

1090
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,540
New York, Chicago and Austin.

1091
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,340
It would be more industry?

1092
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,906
It would be more industry, fans.

1093
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,644
That's too soon, Simon.

1094
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:12,120
And especially for industry people,
I don't think our first time performing

1095
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,419
these songs need to be in front
of industry people

1096
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,255
while we're still feeling out
how we are gonna--

1097
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,193
- How are we gonna do that?
- --move and look.

1098
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:22,322
If you want it to be really good,
all we have to do is start early enough

1099
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,027
to make it good, so I don't understand
what your problem is.

1100
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,968
I don't think we're being
cautious enough.

1101
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,768
I think it should be
very calculated.

1102
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,072
I feel like we're treating this
like every other record,

1103
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,374
and we all agreed that
that is not the way

1104
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,471
this needed to be treated.
It scares me.

1105
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:41,415
There's a lot of people out there
who already have their minds made up.

1106
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,918
- It doesn't matter.
- What's that gotta do--

1107
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:46,615
We have never gone into a record
being judged the way

1108
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,749
we are gonna be judged
this time. Never.

1109
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,527
After the comment,
when we got all the criticism,

1110
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,660
it was just a really scary time.

1111
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,035
It was just wrong what happened,
not only to us,

1112
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,700
but other people that were,
you know, shut up

1113
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,436
or made to feel threatened

1114
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:43,445
for feeling a certain way,
you know, about the war or whatever.

1115
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,880
Everything was so bizarre,
it was almost humorous.

1116
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,747
I just could not believe

1117
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,547
people cared what I said.

1118
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,554
But it had to be somebody

1119
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,522
or some group
that seemed like

1120
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,287
the all-American girls.
It was perfect.

1121
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,954
It had to be

1122
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,827
the unlikely voice

1123
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,264
from what looked like

1124
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,531
the conservative heart
of America saying it.

1125
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,333
That was perfect.

1126
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,976
To me, it was something
really just an episode,

1127
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,313
and okay, we're gonna lose
some record sales,

1128
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,217
and it's more important
to stand up for what's right,

1129
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,188
and be a strong unit together
and support each other.

1130
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,714
But then when the death threat came,
I thought,

1131
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,990
"Okay, this is different league.
It's a totally different league."

1132
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,993
Thank you, Los Angeles!

1133
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,902
That was the envelope tonight.

1134
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:02,389
It says, "Natalie Maines will be
shot dead Sunday, July 6th,

1135
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:05,360
in Dallas, Texas."

1136
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,385
- You know the Dallas threat?
- Yeah.

1137
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,399
They have a guy, the police have,
reason to believe he might be the guy.

1138
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,333
- Really?
- Because he's made other threats

1139
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,858
against senators
in the same way--

1140
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,269
Can they make sure
he's nowhere near Dallas?

1141
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,035
I'm gonna have a policeman on him
for the whole time we're in Dallas,

1142
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,374
and outside his house, and just so
they're always on him the whole time.

1143
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,777
They think this is the person.

1144
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,543
God.

1145
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,709
The handwriting sort of matches.

1146
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,219
The FBI had some intelligence
on this guy

1147
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,778
with some other threats,

1148
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,724
possibly to you guys,
but they didn't share it to anybody.

1149
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,989
We're trying to get
more info on it,

1150
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,088
but we're gonna have people
watching him during the show.

1151
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,760
He's kind of cute.

1152
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:49,100
He is.
He's a good-looking guy.

1153
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,935
The hairspray's got you.

1154
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:57,011
When we start Texas,
we're in serious danger territory.

1155
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,413
So get your shit together
because--

1156
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,643
It's very scary.

1157
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,778
As I said, we're making
some changes with security.

1158
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,811
This should be
a Texas Rangers issue.

1159
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,756
No one fucks
with the Texas Rangers.

1160
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,351
Do you think the National Guard
should be in Dallas?

1161
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:15,361
The National Guard?

1162
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,631
What, like tanks?

1163
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,466
Armored personnel carriers?

1164
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:25,838
- Like they do at the airports.
- Inside the building?

1165
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,105
Keeping an eye
on the section?

1166
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,271
If I was a person bringing
a gun into a show,

1167
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,371
I'd bring the smallest
possible gun

1168
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,882
and probably put it
in my crotch

1169
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,214
because nobody is gonna feel
somebody's crotch up.

1170
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,584
I wouldn't.
I'd put it up in my ankle.

1171
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,647
- They wand your feet.
- They don't get down that far.

1172
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,523
And you expect us
to want to play a show in Dallas

1173
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,358
and you're telling us
they don't feel people's legs.

1174
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,854
They can't touch people.
They cannot touch people.

1175
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,835
Okay then, at Dallas
we have metal detectors.

1176
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,396
I know how vulnerable I feel.
I can't imagine how Natalie feels.

1177
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,408
Standing up there,
you feel so naked.

1178
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:02,673
So naked.

1179
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:07,805
Hello.

1180
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:11,445
The last thing I said to Charlie was...

1181
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:16,783
"I'll call you tonight
if I don't get shot."

1182
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,157
Oh!

1183
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,958
Say, 6:30,
we walk out the door at 6:45

1184
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:23,658
and we fly in,
and then when we land,

1185
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,031
the cops are gonna take us
right to the stage.

1186
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,196
There's never any time where
we're stopped inside the venue.

1187
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:32,469
Hi, Asvia, this is Natalie Pasdar.

1188
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:36,376
You gave me a reading
about a year ago, probably.

1189
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,438
I just wanna know
if you feel like

1190
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,540
I'm in any danger

1191
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,211
or if I'm safe.

1192
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:46,153
So please give me a call.
Thank you, bye.

1193
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,959
Be right there.

1194
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,430
Come in, Mindi.

1195
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,905
I'm not expecting to look at anybody

1196
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,467
before we walk out of the room
and say, "Is it clear?"

1197
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,275
I'm just expecting it to be clear.
And I want someone in front of me

1198
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,782
when we're walking, and I want
someone to be sitting there

1199
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,613
waiting for us
when we get there.

1200
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,925
Number two check.

1201
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,063
I had proposed a song idea

1202
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,833
to them called "Undivided,"

1203
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,965
'cause I thought that people were
being divided by politics

1204
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,908
and being like,
"Okay, you have to be on this side,

1205
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,878
and you have to be on this side. Now you
all go ahead and hate each other."

1206
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,211
And be about also how the girls
have dealt with controversy.

1207
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,843
Instead of being divided
and conquered,

1208
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,683
they stuck together.
Natalie thought about it for a second.

1209
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,315
Then she said,
"Well, does that mean

1210
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,155
that in the song I would have
to forgive the people

1211
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,753
who did all that to us?"

1212
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,856
And I said, "Maybe it would
for the song. Maybe it would."

1213
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,129
And she went, "Nope."

1214
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:09,381
That's just the most
emotional song on the record for me.

1215
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:12,758
It took about, I'd say,
a hundred listens

1216
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,763
before I didn't get choked up,

1217
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,322
literally, just every time I play it
for somebody,

1218
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,129
or heard it in the car
or whatever,

1219
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,899
it made me realize how raw
the emotions still were.

1220
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,717
The Dixie Chicks may soon
cause a stir with lyrics

1221
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,242
from their upcoming album.

1222
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,777
This single
"Not Ready to Make Nice"

1223
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,484
is not big on the radio,

1224
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,458
and is really not big
on country radio.

1225
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:47,826
The Dixie Chicks have all
but challenged

1226
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,764
country music stations
to stop playing their music.

1227
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:55,702
Joanne's e-mail this morning
was the south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

1228
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,536
We have no one
other than one station--

1229
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,337
So lose a few.

1230
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,867
Miami, LA and Knoxville.

1231
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,438
At least the album's
fucking delivered.

1232
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,913
Mind your step, ladies. I know you're
having fun, but mind your step, please.

1233
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:17,824
So, girls, one thing that did
come up today in my meeting with Sony,

1234
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,693
the big concern
that they have is

1235
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,061
we really don't know
what's gonna happen on radio.

1236
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:26,829
They wanna have us doing
as much TV

1237
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:30,430
as we can get done.
So let me throw out some TV ideas

1238
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,565
and get some feedback
from you:

1239
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,438
"The View," if it was
just an interview

1240
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,744
with Barbara Walters,

1241
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,843
and if we went in

1242
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,583
and we did the production as opposed
to "The View" doing the production.

1243
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,215
"Regis and"--

1244
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,021
Kelly?

1245
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,323
Now tell us, first, with each show

1246
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,330
what's the mandatory performance?

1247
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,491
Okay, can I just throw
this out there?

1248
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:01,333
Why can't we...

1249
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:05,170
can we decide what kind of artists
we want to be right now?

1250
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,107
Sure.

1251
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,203
Can we be the Bruce Springsteen

1252
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,807
and the Bob Dylan--
not that I'm comparing our music

1253
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,149
and ourselves to them--
but do we have to be

1254
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,178
on everything
that they'll let us be on?

1255
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,450
I just don't care.

1256
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,685
Here's what everyone
is wrestling with.

1257
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:27,491
You are the biggest-selling group in
North America in the last eight years.

1258
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,430
No one has sold, combined,
more records than you have.

1259
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,730
I don't give a shit what Sony wants
We know what Sony wants-- money.

1260
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,760
We've always been a cash cow.
They're worried we're not gonna be that.

1261
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,136
I think what
they're wrestling with

1262
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,607
is they're wrestling
with expectations.

1263
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,736
They look at you
as the act that they expect

1264
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:47,647
to drive more sales with
than any other band on Columbia

1265
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,480
releasing an album this year.

1266
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,543
Hey, Natalie, Natalie.

1267
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,359
I read that you all
felt like this album was

1268
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,060
a rebirth or kind of like
starting over.

1269
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,500
Everything seems like
the first time again.

1270
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:10,096
- We knew it had to be personal.
- It feels really good.

1271
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,732
As we expected,
Dixie Chicks album debuted

1272
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:16,266
at number one on the Billboard 200
and on our country albums chart as well.

1273
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,472
Everybody is talking
about the Dixie Chicks.

1274
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,312
They're right there
on the cover of "Time" magazine.

1275
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,511
Does it still surprise you
what went down?

1276
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,816
The biggest surprise to me

1277
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,312
was how many people were terrified
to even be associated with us.

1278
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,156
Public opinion has changed
so much in the last three years.

1279
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,925
Bush's approval rating is kind of down.
Does that impact on you?

1280
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,592
We just made the album we'd--
not even wanted to make,

1281
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:41,296
but needed to make.

1282
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,600
The new poll is certainly
a blow for the president,

1283
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:47,097
showing a public fed up with the war
and his handling of it.

1284
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,406
Tonight questions about
claims the president

1285
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,038
and members of his administration
made in 2003.

1286
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,674
There are a lot of legitimate
questions about this president,

1287
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,685
how he misled the public on the issue
of weapons of mass destruction.

1288
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,153
We did not find the weapons
of mass destruction

1289
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,782
and that's raised questions
about whether the sacrifice

1290
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,485
in Iraq has been worth it.

1291
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:08,018
59% call the war
in Iraq a mistake.

1292
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,863
Why did you lie to get us
into a war that was not necessary

1293
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,391
and that has caused
these kinds of casualties?

1294
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:18,668
As we mentioned earlier,
the number of US deaths has hit 2500,

1295
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,403
and so far, 18,490 troops
have been wounded.

1296
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,537
The president has
completely blown it with this war.

1297
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,810
I am sorry about what I said,
I'll tell you the truth.

1298
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,873
'Cause they took a very bold
and brave stand.

1299
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,317
You guys were absolutely right.
Right now you're not wearing panties.

1300
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,844
- Is that a political thing?
- Is that a Dixie Chick thing?

1301
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:36,551
I won't wear panties
until the war is over.

1302
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,493
They got a number-one-selling album

1303
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,996
and didn't have to depend
on radio to do it.

1304
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,760
Does it matter to you
how this album does?

1305
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,769
I'm more scared about
if the tour will sell

1306
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,397
- than the records.
- Yeah, than buy the album.

1307
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,373
No matter what,
we will always make music,

1308
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:56,138
but there's a certain energy
and just that adrenaline

1309
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,874
when you go out onstage
and you have those fans

1310
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,247
that are there. The live show,
for me, is the-- is the total payoff.

1311
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,082
When you have seven kids,
you can't go back to the RV.

1312
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,678
You can't--

1313
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,556
you can't pile everybody in and,
you know, go play small clubs.

1314
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,186
I won't go out without my family.
And so I think

1315
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:16,356
you have to maintain
a certain level of touring.

1316
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:20,630
So, you know, to me that's--
that'll be the measure of success.

1317
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,433
Arenas or nothing.

1318
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,769
There's a whole
new deal that's been proposed.

1319
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,607
AG will make an offer
for the entire tour.

1320
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:35,674
The guarantee is basically $26 million,
versus a 90-10 deal.

1321
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,845
You keep saying the word
"risk-- we're covering our risk."

1322
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,253
What it comes down to is
if we want to take that risk.

1323
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,917
- Absolutely.
- Maybe I'm bass-ackwards here,

1324
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,689
but I would rather know
that we took the risk

1325
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:49,595
and had faith
and lose out on money

1326
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:52,794
than to do what I think
it's gonna do and sell out

1327
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,565
and have that feeling of "Why didn't we
fucking have confidence in ourselves?"

1328
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,698
You know what? If we're
gonna have this conversation,

1329
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,607
we should involve Al in it, and we
should just look at the economics.

1330
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:04,703
You're not
gonna sell out in Nashville,

1331
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:08,580
you won't sell out in Memphis,
you won't sell out in Oklahoma City.

1332
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,778
Now, I mean, we can lose
money really quick.

1333
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,150
I know we can.

1334
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,315
Here was an option
for you to hedge your bet.

1335
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,984
If you don't wanna hedge,

1336
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:20,586
- you don't wanna hedge.
- I am-- I am saying I get all of this.

1337
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,496
I'm totally
with Natalie.

1338
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,693
- And it's--
- And as hard--

1339
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:29,795
as hard as you think it is for us
to work, it'll be harder for me to work

1340
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,363
with a tour that sold out
in two fucking days

1341
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:35,274
and I didn't bet on myself
when I knew I should

1342
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,709
and I'm taking--

1343
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,805
and it's not even about the money!
I'll be pissed at myself.

1344
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:43,045
That will make me unhappy.
It's almost like if you don't sell it

1345
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,986
and you took a gamble on yourself
just like how--

1346
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,353
it lights a fire.
It makes you fight.

1347
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,187
- Just like--
- I'm not--

1348
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,319
I mean, they love the--
listen, I love the fucking attitude.

1349
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,158
- Bring it on!
- Nat, don't get me--

1350
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:58,633
Isn't that what Bush said?
"Bring it on!" Exactly.

1351
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,636
Listen, and you and Al
are either with us or against us.

1352
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,807
Unfortunately, we're with you.

1353
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,606
- Whether you like it or not.
- Whether we like it or not,

1354
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,009
we're in.

1355
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,412
Okay, according to Ticketmaster,

1356
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:16,008
time-- one minute away
from the on-sale start.

1357
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,315
- Good morning.
- Okay. Ah...

1358
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,082
- Philadelphia...
- Okay.

1359
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:24,718
...sold, 69; open, 7942.

1360
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,729
Toronto?
Simon, uh...

1361
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,163
- Toronto needs to roll right now.
- That's too bad.

1362
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,666
Can you roll Toronto
to the second show?

1363
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,067
Definitely.
I will send it off right now.

1364
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:38,004
Thank you.
Philadelphia, pull back.

1365
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,939
Pull back, Atlanta.

1366
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,910
So don't roll any of them
with the exception of Toronto.

1367
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,775
Really?
Okay, bye-bye.

1368
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,373
So we rolled Toronto.
What else is happening?

1369
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:48,905
Toronto rolled right out.

1370
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,214
The other ones--
you still had open seats.

1371
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,848
- It's the South.
- Atlanta is definitely slow.

1372
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,755
This is not good.

1373
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,522
I mean, I hate to throw
a dose of reality on this.

1374
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:02,394
- I don't disagree with you.
- Even in Boston--

1375
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,831
those aren't good counts.
We've gotta be honest with each other,

1376
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,097
- they're not good counts.
- No.

1377
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,604
Can I throw
a radical idea out here?

1378
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,803
Do we take Milwaukee, KC,
Saint Louis, Indy, Des Moines,

1379
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:17,311
literally move them back
into October

1380
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:20,781
and try to just slam Canada
in-out of Chicago and Minnie

1381
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,841
and go spend our time
up in Canada?

1382
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,681
That's a great idea, I think.

1383
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,949
'Cause Canada seems
to be really strong.

1384
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:30,082
I'm talking about playing
Kamloops, Moose Jaw--

1385
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,685
everywhere there's a hockey arena,
let's go play.

1386
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,457
- Moose Jaw.
- Yeah, there's a town called Moose Jaw.

1387
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,492
- And it's got a hockey arena?
- Yeah.

1388
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,503
And that's where we're at.
We are not selling to country right now.

1389
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,131
- We are selling to a new audience.
- Well, we're not-- yeah.

1390
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,334
We're a new band.
And the next tour we do,

1391
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,468
if this record is a hit
to the new audience,

1392
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,480
we're back playing-- that's where
we're rebuilding a career

1393
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,074
with a whole new-- it's a new band
and a new audience.

1394
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,950
It feels like
we've been beat up

1395
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:09,020
and then we've been pushed
back in the ring.

1396
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,194
It's just emotionally draining
and-- and--

1397
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:17,069
And the tour,
I think it's the first...

1398
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,868
non-success we've had.

1399
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:22,343
People ask
about sluggish tickets...

1400
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:27,339
there's no denying
we have sluggish tickets.

1401
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,646
I'm not-- and I'm not
embarrassed by that.

1402
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,709
So I don't feel the need
to put a spin on it.

1403
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:34,881
But I think it had gotten to the point
where it was just kind of scary--

1404
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,118
when the ticket sales
were sluggish--

1405
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,649
that we had committed
to a lot of people.

1406
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:44,563
You know, these people depended on us
for the next six months of their lives.

1407
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:49,161
It's a huge burden and,
at the same time, it's a lot of stress.

1408
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:04,884
We know everyone's been hearing
a lot of rumors about the tour...

1409
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,854
what's happening,

1410
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,914
and we just wanted
to settle all the rumors,

1411
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:14,486
just saying that we will be starting
the tour on the 21st of July as planned.

1412
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,929
Oh-oh--
we did want to say though

1413
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,433
we are having to cut corners

1414
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:23,369
in places and meat's expensive
and y'all drink a lot of beers

1415
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:26,499
so both of those are off.

1416
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:51,025
If you gauge your career

1417
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,968
by how many people buy
your albums or are at the concert,

1418
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,904
I don't think we'll ever be
in that place again.

1419
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,705
But, you know,
it's giving us this fire back.

1420
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,837
I don't know, there's just
something to say for--

1421
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:08,371
having that back,
that want to...

1422
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,407
garner new fans,
or uh...

1423
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,477
just prove yourself
all over again.

1424
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,857
I think Natalie still feels
pressure about what's happened,

1425
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,266
even though we say
over and over and over again,

1426
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,568
"It was the best thing"-- I can tell her
that and shake her all day long.

1427
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,666
"It's the best thing that ever
happened to me. It's the best thing

1428
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,438
that ever happened
to our career.

1429
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:39,447
We'd never change it.
You're fine.

1430
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:42,245
You didn't do anything."

1431
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,157
And I just think she still--

1432
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,724
she still, um...

1433
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,857
feels responsible.

1434
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:01,335
And if she came to me
tomorrow and said,

1435
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:04,998
"I don't want to tour.
I don't want to record anymore.

1436
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,167
I don't want to do this,"

1437
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:11,542
I care for her. I'd say, "Okay."
I'd give up my career...

1438
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,413
for her to be happy,
be at peace.

1439
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:23,549
It's great to be back
at Shepherds Bush.

1440
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:30,246
The return to the scene
of the crime.

1441
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,769
And all week, the only thing
people keep asking is,

1442
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,797
"What are you gonna say?
Do you know what you're gonna say?"

1443
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:50,538
As usual,
I didn't plan anything,

1444
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,569
but I thought I'd say
something brand new

1445
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,377
and just say,
"Just so you know,

1446
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:57,578
we're ashamed the President
of the United States is from Texas."

1447
01:25:58,305 --> 01:26:04,385
