1
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,969
Don't go to sleep.
He's waiting for you.

2
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:59,365
Don't go to sleep.

3
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,125
Hey! What's going on?

4
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:20,068
Oh, man.

5
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,399
- Well?
- He's here.

6
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,674
Who's here?

7
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,238
He came out of the closet.

8
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,313
Tim, nobody's here.
What are you talking about?

9
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:36,482
Him.

10
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,788
Okay.

11
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,030
Tim.

12
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,935
It's just a story. Okay? He's not real.

13
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,211
Well, let's have a look around, then,
shall we?

14
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:02,649
No.

15
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,129
Nothing back here.

16
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:17,996
Okay.

17
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,705
Hello.

18
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,245
Nope.

19
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,985
Nobody home.

20
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,722
Just us.

21
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:58,381
No!

22
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,253
This is gonna get ugly.

23
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:36,158
No more vodka.

24
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:39,761
Hey, Tim. Let me have
one of those green things.

25
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,836
Careful. No more for Pam.

26
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,806
Hey. It's my party.

27
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,641
You still on for this weekend?

28
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,341
No, thought I'd wrangle up
a dinner invitation...

29
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,080
...from one of those art-department
girls. Like this one right here.

30
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,088
- Here you go.
- Oh, hey, thank you.

31
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,487
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,722
Hey, Scotty, did Tim tell you about
meeting my parents tomorrow?

33
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,731
Meeting the folks? Sounds serious.

34
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,929
Yeah, if he can survive the weekend
with Jessica's father.

35
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,166
Oh, come on. Dad's not that bad.
Don't listen to that.

36
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:15,334
- He tried to drown you.
- You shouldn't have told her.

37
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,572
I was 7.
He was teaching me to swim.

38
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:19,308
By throwing you in a lake?

39
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:22,214
You know, this might be
a good time for a toast.

40
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,288
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'd say.

41
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,186
Excuse me, everyone.

42
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,759
When we come back
from Thanksgiving on Monday...

43
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,693
...things will be a lot different.

44
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,263
For starters...

45
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,697
...it'll be a lot quieter.

46
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,063
But it definitely won't be as much fun.

47
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,737
The Daily News is lucky to get you.

48
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,809
Cheers.

49
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,749
Okay, break it up.

50
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,047
- Be good, Jess.
- I will.

51
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,985
I'm gonna miss you.

52
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,126
All of you.

53
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,926
I'm gonna miss you too.

54
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,459
So I told my parents I'd be there by 11.

55
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,729
All right, I'll get your coat.

56
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:06,769
Thank you.

57
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,637
Hey.

58
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,436
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

59
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,076
Not getting weird on me again,
are you?

60
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:48,280
No, no. I just spaced out for a second.

61
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:53,553
Okay.

62
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:55,592
Where's your car?

63
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,995
It wouldn't start.

64
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,603
- Is it gonna make it?
- I got a guy looking at it.

65
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,569
If you think you can use
the "car broke down" excuse...

66
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,233
...to get out of this, you're mistaken.
- I'll be there, I promise.

67
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,937
Okay.

68
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,145
So you want a ride home?

69
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,219
No, I'm good. I'll cut through the park.

70
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:16,687
- Besides, I've seen your driving.
- Yeah, okay.

71
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:22,496
- Be careful.
- I'll be fine.

72
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,369
See you tomorrow.

73
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,457
I don't...
Who would have done this?

74
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,099
Who would've taken...?

75
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,566
Who would...?
Who would take him?

76
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:26,196
Why would they do this?
Where is he?

77
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,408
Tim, it's Uncle Mike.

78
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:33,578
I know you're having Thanksgiving
with your girlfriend and all...

79
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:37,919
...but it'd be nice if you could make it
out to see your mom this weekend.

80
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:42,429
She's not doing so well, and, you
know, it'd be good for her to see you.

81
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,334
And, hey, i got some stuff
for you to sign too, house stuff.

82
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,634
All right, hope i see you this weekend.

83
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,075
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey.

84
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,837
Hey.

85
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:26,815
- Were the directions okay?
- Perfect. Here.

86
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,214
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

87
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,879
Shouldn't we wait for the bellhop
or something?

88
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,516
Shut up. It's their house, not mine.

89
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,162
What's with the tie?

90
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,993
I figured, meeting the family.
Why not, right?

91
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,762
Come on. Let's put your stuff
in the guestroom.

92
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:46,066
So Jessica tells us you two met
at the magazine.

93
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:50,179
- Are you in the art department?
- I'm an associate editor.

94
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:53,578
- Sounds impressive.
- It's just a glorified fact-checker.

95
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,219
- Tim's very good at his job.
- How about family?

96
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,948
Got any family nearby?
Any brothers, sisters?

97
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:01,251
No, sir. No brothers or sisters,
just me.

98
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,793
- How about your folks?
- Let the boy eat.

99
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,931
- We're just talking, Mother.
- Dad.

100
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,465
The family thing's kind of
complicated, sir.

101
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,129
This stuffing is delicious, Chelsea.

102
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:15,400
Tim's had kind of a strained
relationship with his parents.

103
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,011
- Tim's father ran out when he was 8.
- Jess.

104
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,615
Oh, that's sad.

105
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,811
Then he had to go live with his uncle,
in a tiny room in the back of his bar.

106
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:27,951
Well, what about your mother?

107
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:34,195
She sort of had a tough time
after my dad left.

108
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,168
It was pretty hard on both of us.

109
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:44,506
Is there anything else
you wanted to know, Dad?

110
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,776
Be down in a minute, Mom.

111
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:49,874
You have fun down there?

112
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,543
Oh, come on. They could use
a little shaking up.

113
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,713
You see my sister's face
when I said...

114
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,452
...you lived in a tiny room
in the back of a bar?

115
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,754
It wasn't in the back of a bar,
you know.

116
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,525
I know. I just like messing with them.

117
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,331
Is that why you wanted me here,
to freak out your family?

118
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:09,702
No.

119
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:11,775
No.

120
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,379
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

121
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,845
Tell you what...

122
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:18,008
...I gotta go down, say good night...

123
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,711
...but I'll sneak in later
and make it up to you.

124
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,155
Okay?

125
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,561
In that case...

126
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,228
...I'll put on something naughty.

127
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,538
You do that.

128
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,361
I like this sneaking-around thing.

129
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,332
It's kind of dirty.

130
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,301
You all right?

131
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:01,644
Timmy.

132
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:03,806
You can't keep running away.

133
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:08,521
- Look at me.
- Mom?

134
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,420
Why, what's the matter with you?
Look at me!

135
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:13,185
Look at me.

136
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,024
Look at me.

137
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,900
You're a bad little boy.

138
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,532
Tim? Baby, what are you doing
on the floor?

139
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,806
Tim, what is it?

140
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,947
Jessica.

141
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,009
Oh, God, I had
the most messed-up dream.

142
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,747
What was it?

143
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,485
- I gotta go see my mom.
- Wait.

144
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,286
- There's something wrong.
- What?

145
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,859
- I know it.
- Tim. Tim, no. Hey.

146
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,965
- Listen, let's get back in bed, and...
- I just gotta...

147
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,659
- Where's my phone?
- Tim, what is wrong with you?

148
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,668
- God.
- Where's my phone?

149
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,601
Just leave it.

150
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,837
Hello.

151
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,606
- Hey, Uncle Mike, I got your message.
- Hey.

152
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,217
Is everything okay?
I'm gonna see Mom tomorrow.

153
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,443
I thought you were here
for the weekend.

154
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,251
- What?
- Tim.

155
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,628
Okay.

156
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,434
Okay.

157
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,265
- Tim.
- I have to go.

158
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:23,709
- You...? Tim, what is it?
- Look, I just have to go.

159
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,335
So the funeral's today.

160
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:53,174
Yeah, this afternoon.

161
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,874
I'm so sorry, Tim.

162
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:57,644
Me too.

163
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:07,560
That's fantastic. That's really strong.

164
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,757
What's that you've got, Peter?

165
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:14,395
Oh, that rainbow is beautiful.
How many colors in there?

166
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,099
I'm thinking of going by
the old house.

167
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:21,136
- Really?
- My uncle's been fixing the place up...

168
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:24,148
...to sell since Mom went
to the hospital last year.

169
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:27,345
I felt like I should be the one
to go through her things.

170
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,587
I should've done more,
but it's something, right?

171
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,563
Listen to me, Tim.
Something happened in that house...

172
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,327
...but it wasn't supernatural.

173
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:42,165
There's nothing in there
but memories.

174
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:46,774
You dealt with your father's leaving
the best way that you could.

175
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:48,573
But you were 8.

176
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:52,583
Tim, you've been coming here
for what, 15 years?

177
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,618
Look around you.

178
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,346
There's only children here.

179
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:01,225
Dr. Matheson to Observation.

180
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm sorry. I have to go.

181
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,569
Go home, Tim.

182
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,604
Spend one night in that house.

183
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,573
It will help.

184
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,598
It's okay. It's okay.

185
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey, we need some help in here!

186
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:41,743
Hey, the nurse is on the way.
It's okay, it's all right.

187
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,937
What? What is it?

188
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,045
Just relax now.
It's gonna be all right.

189
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:16,117
It's all right.

190
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,778
Everything's gonna be all right.

191
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,246
And in Paul's letter
to the Corinthians, he says:

192
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,788
"We shall not all fall asleep...

193
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,187
...but we will all be changed...

194
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,888
...in an instant, in the blink of an eye."

195
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:25,125
"When my tongue rejoices,
my body will rest in peace...

196
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,828
...because you will not abandon me
to the grave.

197
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:31,669
For you, O Lord, have delivered
my soul to death...

198
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:36,407
...my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling."

199
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,847
"Thou knowest the secrets..."

200
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,000
"...spare us.

201
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,402
Suffer us not in our last hour."

202
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,709
"Dust thou art...

203
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:04,076
...and unto dust thou shalt return."

204
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,917
Thanks for doing all this.

205
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,214
She was my sister.

206
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,622
When are you heading back?

207
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:17,491
Actually, I might stay in town tonight.
In the house.

208
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,463
- I thought you didn't like that house.
- Yeah, well.

209
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:25,232
Tim, the place is a mess. I've been
doing a whole lot of work there...

210
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,841
I won't mess anything up.

211
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,039
Is that Katie?

212
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,648
Yeah.

213
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,849
How long has it been?

214
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,078
- A long time.
- You should go and say hi.

215
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,348
No, I don't think so.

216
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,483
All right. Suit yourself.

217
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,728
Hey, come here.

218
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:52,873
Here you go. You might need these.

219
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,708
Thanks for everything.

220
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,871
It's good seeing you again, Tim.

221
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,957
Timmy.

222
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:53,860
You know, it's your cat,
and you're supposed to feed her.

223
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,643
Come on, Timmy, just turn
the light on. I'm not coming up there.

224
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,147
He's scared of his damn closet.

225
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:06,480
You know why he's so scared,
don't you?

226
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,555
- Why?
- Because you freaked him out...

227
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,589
...with that stupid story of yours.

228
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,955
You've gotta be kidding.
It was a story.

229
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:16,189
- My dad did the same thing to me.
- Look how you turned out.

230
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:19,824
- It was nothing, okay?
- He's got a very vivid imagination.

231
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,995
Mary, this is ridiculous. I was just...

232
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:24,698
You're gonna put that boy
in therapy.

233
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,503
- Just calm down, okay?
- Timmy.

234
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,644
Cody. Cody.

235
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:27,917
Kate!

236
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:38,801
Kate!

237
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,605
- Cody.
- Are you all right?

238
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,537
Yeah.

239
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,770
I think I just hit my head.

240
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:49,975
He's never done that before.

241
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,816
Do you wanna come in,
put some ice on that?

242
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:56,088
Sure.

243
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,503
I saw you at the funeral.

244
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:09,833
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

245
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,539
I'm real sorry about your mom.

246
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,311
Yeah, me too.

247
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:27,154
- How about that ice?
- Yeah.

248
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,461
- Sorry.
- What are you trying to do?

249
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,725
- I'm sorry.
- I'm in pain.

250
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,438
So...

251
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,272
So...

252
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,173
So how's the city?

253
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,739
It's all right.

254
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,407
It's been a little crazy lately, but...

255
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:49,381
You got a girlfriend?

256
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:53,785
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do.

257
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,191
How about you?

258
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,703
- Do I have a girlfriend?
- No.

259
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:08,435
- No, I don't.
- You know what I mean.

260
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,545
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

261
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,144
Just me and my dad.

262
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:17,879
I'm sure some shrink could have
a field day with that.

263
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:22,585
So how long are you staying around?

264
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,319
I think just tonight.

265
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:28,159
I wanted to go through my mom's
things, you know, pictures and stuff.

266
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:31,202
- I found a goofy one of you and me.
- Goofy?

267
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,772
- I don't remember being goofy.
- I'll show you.

268
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:37,810
- It's actually kind of cute.
- No, I don't think. Cute, I believe.

269
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:41,546
Goofy, that's crazy talk.

270
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:44,551
I mean, if you said you saw
a picture that...

271
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:49,716
You know, that was stunning
or, you know, gorgeous...

272
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,127
...okay, you know, I've heard that
a thousand times.

273
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,358
He took Dad, and now he's gonna
take me.

274
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:02,064
Timmy, nobody took your dad.
Okay?

275
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,271
Did you find it?

276
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,048
What?

277
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:11,049
Goofy photo?

278
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,355
Here.

279
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:19,191
Look at us. Even you're adorable.

280
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:20,920
Thanks.

281
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,531
You know, I was crushed
when you left.

282
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,536
It broke my little heart.

283
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:29,970
And it broke my heart
you couldn't throw a baseball.

284
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:33,579
You were the one
that was scared of closets.

285
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:36,010
- I told you that?
- Yeah.

286
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:37,945
I told you closets were nothing.

287
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,781
It's the thing under the bed
you had to be worried about.

288
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:45,552
All right, I have to go home
and start Dad's dinner.

289
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:52,027
I bet you don't have any food
in the house, do you?

290
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:54,670
- I'll come back with some.
- You don't have to.

291
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,274
I know. It's frightening how
domestic I've become, though.

292
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:02,946
Bye.

293
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:11,334
Hello.

294
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,045
Hello.

295
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,729
Hey.

296
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,433
You all right?

297
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,412
Wanna come out?

298
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,345
What were you doing in there?

299
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:21,494
You were at my mother's funeral,
weren't you?

300
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,264
My dad knew her.

301
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,602
What's your name?

302
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,827
Franny.

303
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:34,204
So, Franny, wanna tell me why you're
following me around?

304
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,445
I wanted to talk to you.

305
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,315
I wanted to ask you something.

306
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,487
All right.

307
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:50,392
Wanna ask me now?

308
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,630
Is it true?

309
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:00,770
Is what true?

310
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,138
The Boogeyman took your dad.

311
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:16,450
Look, I don't know where you
heard that, but it's just a story.

312
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:21,461
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

313
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,405
I was trying to make sense of things.

314
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:34,082
My dad left. I was upset.
That's all that happened. Okay?

315
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,615
It's late. Your parents will worry.
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

316
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,523
Next to the park.

317
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,762
It's all right. I've got my own ride.

318
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:54,299
Hey, Franny.

319
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:56,506
Count to five.

320
00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:01,405
When you're afraid,
close your eyes and count to five.

321
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:05,249
Sometimes it works for me.

322
00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:08,656
What happens when you get to six?

323
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:52,507
- You gotta be brave. Come on, Tim.
- No, Dad.

324
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:55,704
Dad. Let me out.

325
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,180
Tim, stop it. Okay? There is nothing
in there. Just trust me.

326
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:02,378
Trust me. There is nothing in there.

327
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:07,024
- "Just count to five like I told you."
- Count to five like I told you, okay?

328
00:43:07,194 --> 00:43:09,560
He's here. He's here.

329
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:18,565
One. Two. Three.

330
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:22,439
- Good boy.
- Four. Five.

331
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:32,514
He's here. He's here.

332
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,739
Tim. Where...?
Where are you going?

333
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,175
- We have to go.
- What happened to your face?

334
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:40,781
- Please. We have to go.
- I called your uncle.

335
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,476
- I am so sorry about...
- I want to go now.

336
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:57,526
Look, I'm sorry for losing it back there.
I just needed to get out of that house.

337
00:46:58,103 --> 00:47:00,197
Hey, it's okay.

338
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,538
It's... It's really late.

339
00:47:06,415 --> 00:47:11,580
Maybe we should stop somewhere
and get some rest, you know?

340
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,533
How are you doing?

341
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:07,111
Tim, come on. I drove two and
a half hours to be with you.

342
00:48:14,762 --> 00:48:17,095
I can't do this anymore, okay?

343
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,294
It's too much, and I'm too tired.

344
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:32,272
Look, can't we just forget
all about the bad stuff...

345
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:35,145
...just for one night?

346
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:38,220
Just try to have some fun?

347
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:44,527
Pretend that nothing else is out there.

348
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:54,276
Listen, why don't you go grab
some ice.

349
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:56,503
I'll get the bath ready.

350
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,678
We can raid the minibar
and have our own little...

351
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,946
..."forget about the world" party.

352
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,183
Okay?

353
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:12,522
- All right.
- Good.

354
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:21,401
Good.

355
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,028
Hey, Tim.

356
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,439
Hello.

357
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:18,499
Anybody home?

358
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:21,371
Tim.

359
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:25,618
Hello.

360
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:52,683
Brought you some food.

361
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:13,976
I'm coming up.

362
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,142
Are you decent?

363
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:55,189
Nice lighting.

364
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:01,456
Tim. Hello.

365
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:03,899
I'll make us a vodka Red Bull.

366
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:11,237
Tim.

367
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:15,306
I might have made these a little strong.

368
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:19,545
Listen, Jess. I just wanna thank you
for putting up with me.

369
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,264
Jessica?

370
00:52:37,143 --> 00:52:38,940
Jessica?

371
00:52:54,163 --> 00:52:55,893
Jessica?

372
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,368
Jessica?

373
00:53:00,405 --> 00:53:02,771
Jessica?

374
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:28,398
Come on, Tim. This isn't funny.

375
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:36,175
How long were you
waiting in there?

376
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:40,188
You scared the crap out of me.

377
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,589
Come on, I made you some food.
Come on.

378
00:54:46,732 --> 00:54:50,066
How did l...? Where's Jessica?

379
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,336
- Who's Jessica?
- We went to the hotel.

380
00:54:54,508 --> 00:54:58,843
- The motel. And then...
- What are you talking about?

381
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,219
- I have to go.
- Tim. Tim.

382
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:07,422
- What the hell is going on?
- Come with me.

383
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,353
I need you to see what I see.

384
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,559
- What's wrong? Where are we going?
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

385
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:18,396
I don't know where I've been
or what I've done. I just don't know.

386
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:28,545
- Oh, God.
- What?

387
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:33,181
That's it. That's the motel.

388
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:57,180
What are we doing here?

389
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,981
Maybe you should go to the front desk
and ask if...

390
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:14,835
Jessica?

391
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,012
I was here.

392
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,105
What happened, Tim?

393
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:51,013
We were here.

394
00:57:56,058 --> 00:58:02,328
I don't know. I went to get ice,
and I came back to...

395
00:58:13,947 --> 00:58:18,248
- He took her.
- What? Who took her?

396
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:22,683
You won't believe me.

397
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,925
Where did the blood
come from, Tim?

398
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,137
Who do you think took your friend?

399
00:58:42,715 --> 00:58:44,944
Tim, if something happened...

400
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:50,282
- lf you accidentally did something...
- I didn't hurt Jessica.

401
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:53,924
Are you sure?

402
00:58:57,632 --> 00:59:00,625
Everybody told me I was
making it up.

403
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:07,534
For 15 years. Ever since my dad left,
telling me over and over.

404
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,308
But I was right.

405
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:18,812
I don't wanna be, but I am.

406
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:23,123
Tim.

407
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,025
Tim.

408
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:48,856
Good night, Tim.

409
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:16,122
Kate! Kate, please open the door!

410
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:21,892
- Kate! Kate. Come out.
- Go home. Get off the porch.

411
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:23,931
- Listen to me.
- You need to get out.

412
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,261
Don't grab me.

413
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,641
- He's in your house.
- My dad is in my house.

414
01:00:30,811 --> 01:00:33,474
He's upstairs, probably
waiting up for me.

415
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:36,107
Tim...

416
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:39,648
...I think maybe you're sick.

417
01:00:40,422 --> 01:00:44,086
And I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

418
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,286
Now, if you don't go home,
I'm calling the police.

419
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:50,297
It wasn't your dad. I saw him.

420
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:53,030
I'm going inside now.

421
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:55,599
Go home.

422
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:58,809
You need help, Tim.

423
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,171
Couldn't sleep either?

424
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:57,207
I was looking for you.
You said you lived by the park.

425
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:03,213
Sometimes when I think he's
in my house, I come out here.

426
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:06,051
Sometimes all night,
until the sun comes up.

427
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:09,022
And everything's okay again.

428
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:13,030
What if your parents come
to check in on you?

429
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,190
I won't be there.

430
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:26,178
I told you a lie.

431
01:02:26,749 --> 01:02:30,186
The story about the night
my father disappeared.

432
01:02:30,354 --> 01:02:31,878
I know.

433
01:02:43,904 --> 01:02:45,769
He took my dad.

434
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:51,242
Tonight he took a friend of mine.

435
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:56,717
He's gonna keep taking people.

436
01:02:56,885 --> 01:02:58,853
Everyone who means
something to me.

437
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,422
I need your help.

438
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:08,163
Why?

439
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:11,997
Because we're the only ones
who believe.

440
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,636
I have to go home.

441
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:38,395
- Hello?
- It's Kate Houghton.

442
01:03:38,568 --> 01:03:43,836
Listen, I was just with Tim...

443
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:48,671
...and I'm worried about him.
He's acting kind of...

444
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:54,977
Could you go over there
and just check in on him?

445
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:58,825
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

446
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:06,092
Dad? Is that you?

447
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:13,332
Franny. Franny.

448
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:19,350
I opened your pack.
I saw your pictures and the articles.

449
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:22,783
- I just need to ask you something.
- Okay.

450
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,856
How do you stop him?

451
01:04:28,595 --> 01:04:30,358
I'm not sure.

452
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,661
I know that house.

453
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,166
I've been here before. Come on.

454
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:50,524
I used to come talk to the man
who lived here.

455
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:56,798
Everyone said he was crazy.

456
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:01,902
He said his daughter was taken.

457
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,673
What are all these words?

458
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,208
I'm not sure.

459
01:06:11,686 --> 01:06:13,813
He sealed up everything.

460
01:06:15,591 --> 01:06:17,559
All the closets and doors.

461
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:30,272
He was trying to understand it.

462
01:06:33,111 --> 01:06:35,341
Trying to give it a name.

463
01:07:06,217 --> 01:07:08,083
He sat here.

464
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:10,454
Waiting.

465
01:07:16,996 --> 01:07:18,624
I don't want to be here.

466
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:38,850
He didn't seal this one.
This was the door.

467
01:07:41,326 --> 01:07:43,192
He was trying to bring him out.

468
01:07:44,096 --> 01:07:45,462
Franny.

469
01:07:45,632 --> 01:07:48,259
We have to go back to the house.

470
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,480
My dad was trying to find me.

471
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:07,957
Trying to beat it.

472
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:13,526
You have to go home.

473
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:16,395
You have to go to the place
where it first started.

474
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,628
That's where you face him.

475
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:20,605
My dad got too scared.

476
01:08:22,508 --> 01:08:24,204
He couldn't face him.

477
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:36,822
I wanna help you.

478
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,231
You can't.
You can only help yourself.

479
01:09:06,761 --> 01:09:08,389
Tim.

480
01:09:12,536 --> 01:09:14,527
Hey, Tim.

481
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,732
You okay, buddy?

482
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:19,933
Kate called.

483
01:09:20,111 --> 01:09:22,808
Said things are getting
a little loose around here.

484
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:56,080
Uncle Mike?

485
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:58,312
Uncle Mike?

486
01:10:00,759 --> 01:10:02,590
Uncle Mike!

487
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:07,891
Hey, Mike!

488
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,302
He took him.

489
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:20,092
He's waiting for you.

490
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:14,985
Tim, what are you doing?
Get in here.

491
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:16,962
Jessica?

492
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,604
Jessica.

493
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,250
Jessica?

494
01:16:00,257 --> 01:16:01,781
Tim?

495
01:16:02,326 --> 01:16:07,060
Mike. Uncle Mike, it's me.
What are you doing?

496
01:16:32,996 --> 01:16:35,625
Mike, Mike, I'm here.

497
01:16:37,868 --> 01:16:41,635
Can you hear me?
All right, all right, he's gone.

498
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:44,275
I'm gonna save you. Come on!

499
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,312
All right, hold on.

500
01:16:50,683 --> 01:16:53,414
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

501
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:13,066
- Check in on him?

502
01:17:13,678 --> 01:17:15,043
Thanks.

503
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,346
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

504
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:22,947
Dad? Is that you?

505
01:17:39,675 --> 01:17:41,940
What was that? What was that?

506
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,449
I have to stop this.
I have to go after him.

507
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:53,786
He's leading me somewhere. If I'm not
around, he won't bother you, okay?

508
01:17:56,562 --> 01:17:58,428
Tim.

509
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:13,415
I don't understand.

510
01:18:14,017 --> 01:18:15,781
Tim!

511
01:18:21,025 --> 01:18:23,392
Help! Come on, come on!

512
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:26,260
Help! Get him off! No!

513
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:47,614
I gotta get you out of here.

514
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:50,885
- Kate, come on! Come on, go, go!
- What? What?

515
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:55,295
What happened? Come on!

516
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:57,435
We gotta get out of here!

517
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,600
Come on! Come on, help me!
Come on, Tim!

518
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,091
Oh, God.

519
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:26,692
Go to the place where
it first started.

520
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,168
One.

521
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,268
Two.

522
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,344
- Three.
- Dad.

523
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,442
Four.

524
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:39,385
- Five.
- My dad got too scared.

525
01:19:39,553 --> 01:19:41,145
You have to face him.

526
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,289
Six.

527
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:53,392
Tim, is he gone?

528
01:19:57,907 --> 01:19:59,535
Tim?

529
01:20:09,589 --> 01:20:11,420
What are you doing?

530
01:20:50,237 --> 01:20:51,796
Come on!

531
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:09,048
Tim!

532
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,366
He's gone.

533
01:22:34,328 --> 01:22:36,263
Is it over?

534
01:22:38,734 --> 01:22:40,258
Yeah.

535
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:43,805
Yeah, it's over.

536
01:22:46,843 --> 01:22:48,971
He's not coming back.

537
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,831
Mom?

538
01:28:39,999 --> 01:28:41,729
Mom?

539
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:45,268
Could you close the closet door?
