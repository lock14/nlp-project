00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,669
I'm Mao Dabing ("Great Soldier" Mao)

3
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,744
My parents threw me out when I was a kid

4
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,142
I came to the city to look for a job

5
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,806
I tried everything

6
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,745
Now I have a job delivering water

7
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,180
I love movies

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,583
Aside from food and rent...

9
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,556
...I spent all my money on movies

10
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,764
Each ticket costs three or four days' pay

11
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,943
I like action movies best of all

12
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,774
The more bloodthirsty, the better

13
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,412
I can see myself as the movie hero

14
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,982
But most movies are too short

15
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,689
They end just when I'm getting into them

16
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,983
So I go to the weekend all-night shows

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,458
Four movies, non-stop

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,921
It's like spending the whole night dreaming

19
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,163
This is an okay job

20
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,201
The boss gives each of us a bike

21
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,508
Dunno why people don't drink tap water

22
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,670
Is it poisonous?

23
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,849
They prefer bottled water

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,184
Just as well they do...

25
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,479
Keeps me in work!

26
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,018
Hi!

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,689
Hi!

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,088
Hi!

29
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:08,887
Thank you

30
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,290
Thank you

31
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,297
Thanks a lot

32
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,094
I make twenty deliveries a day

33
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,797
That's five or six hundred a month

34
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,336
But I don't know the customers

35
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,105
They mostly ignore me

36
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,650
Good things happen in movies,
not in my life

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,944
But one day when I'd finished work...

38
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,179
I was rushing to catch the latest release

39
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,119
And something terrible happened

40
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,725
Something I never could have imag ined

41
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,211
He's coming round

42
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,609
What's going on?

43
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,982
Do you recall what happened?

44
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,023
Do I recall?

45
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,791
Yeah, well...

46
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,623
I was on my bike, going to see a movie

47
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,598
And I ran into this stack of bricks

48
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,757
I fell off my bike

49
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,664
And just as I was picking myself up...

50
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,236
...some girl picked up a brick...

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,738
...and hit me!

52
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,602
Nothing wrong with his memory

53
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,336
I think she was in a white dress

54
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,746
Do you know her?

55
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,677
No, I don't

56
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,975
Then why did she hit you?

57
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,980
I wish I knew

58
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,113
What's your work unit?

59
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:19,655
I work for a company, delivering water

60
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,762
Officer, my... my bike?

61
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,053
It's a write-off

62
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:29,292
Oh, no!

63
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,099
Why did you hit him?

64
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,440
You won't say, will you?

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,843
What an attitude!

66
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,517
Xiao, please step outside

67
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,422
She is so obstinate!

68
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,819
Hasn't said a single word

69
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,161
Xiao, don't be impatient

70
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,389
You're new to this, take it easy

71
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,624
Don't lose your temper

72
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,922
It's you! You!

73
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,754
Why did you hit me?

74
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,930
Don't play dumb, look at me!

75
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,600
Recognize me?

76
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,925
You've nothing against me!

77
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,500
Why did you hit me?

78
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,663
See? You cracked my head open!

79
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,704
What made you do it?

80
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,175
Stop acting dumb, okay?

81
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,171
Listen, I've lost my job

82
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,180
And I gotta pay for the bike

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,283
So you owe me

84
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:58,180
Do you hear me? Why are you crying?

85
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,052
I didn't hit you, you hit me!

86
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,064
What's with you?

87
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,738
Are you writing?

88
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,838
There's no need

89
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,267
I've worked it out already

90
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,639
Doctor's bill, sick pay...

91
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,311
Compensation for the shock...

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,345
Let's call it... RMB 500

93
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,778
What?

94
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,913
You want me to feed your fishes?

95
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,657
Why should I?

96
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,624
What're you doing?

97
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,092
Don't pick on me!

98
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,748
There's no such thing as a free lunch

99
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,217
And you don't get hit for nothing either

100
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,852
My injury was a motiveless crime

101
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,218
But it got me into this really weird room

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,118
This place is like a tiny cinema

103
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,161
Now I hope she doesn't come back
any time soon

104
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,266
Then I can stay here for a while

105
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,013
I still have no idea
why she hit me with that brick

106
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,310
I don't even know her!

107
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,145
It beats me

108
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,381
But I can't shake the memory of her eyes

109
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,653
I got the feeling she'd seen a lot...

110
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,141
"If my life..."

111
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,643
If my life were a movie...

112
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,247
...I'd be the only one watching it

113
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,246
I wanted to record my memories...

114
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,283
...as if they were a movie

115
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,888
It'll be like seeing the ones I loved

116
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,158
Remembering how they looked...

117
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,424
Hearing their familiar voices...

118
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,907
"Italian film director Antonioni..."

119
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,476
"...in his documentary about China..."

120
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,806
The woman speaking is my mother

121
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,584
Everyone in this small town
is jealous of her

122
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,818
She doesn't need to get dirty
working down the mine

123
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,281
She stays in the studio
broadcasting news reports

124
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,625
Daren, is there a movie tonight?

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,529
'The Red Lantern' at 7:00 p.m.

126
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,327
Let's go home to eat...

127
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,162
...and then come back to watch the movie

128
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,705
"That ends today's broadcast"

129
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,276
"Until tomorrow!"

130
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,014
My mother's ultimate dream...

131
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,182
...was to be like the singer Zhou Xuan

132
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,915
And become a movie star

133
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,810
But at that time...

134
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,648
...Zhou Xuan's movies were banned

135
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,447
Part of the struggle against capitalism

136
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,900
Just like any beautiful young woman...

137
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,738
...in her best years, my mother...

138
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,875
...fell dangerously in love

139
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,518
Excellent!

140
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,713
What's so excellent?

141
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,515
Think she's well cast as Li Tiemei?

142
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,417
She's like the kind of singer...

143
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,289
...they used to have in restaurants

144
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,622
I'd go so far as to call her
counter-revolutionary

145
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,509
The Cultural Troupe liked my mother

146
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,179
They planned to train her
to a professional level

147
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,911
But at that critical moment...

148
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,951
...love brought her not only
a passionate romance...

149
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,285
...but also me

150
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,793
"The Xinua News Agency reports..."

151
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,864
"President Nixon and his wife..."

152
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,797
"...are invited to a cultural performance
tonight"

153
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,869
"They'll see the modern revolutionary
opera..."

154
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,767
"...Red Detachment of Women"

155
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,134
"Premier Zhou Enlai will accompany
the president and his wife..."

156
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,867
"...to watch the performance"

157
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,912
"Also present will be officials from..."

158
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,249
"...the State Department..."

159
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,406
By mistake, my mother put on a banned song

160
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,072
She narrowly escaped being branded
a 'counter-revolutionary'

161
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:44,720
One day, her lover (that's my father)
abandoned her

162
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,516
She was seven months' pregnant

163
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,458
Her plan was go somewhere far away

164
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,622
Give birth in secret,
and have me adopted

165
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,600
She thought no-one would find out

166
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,705
Even at that moment,
her dreams were still intact

167
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,132
She imagined that one day...

168
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,641
...she'd become the brightest of stars

169
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,322
Daren, what's the movie tonight?

170
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,761
A foreign movie!

171
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,133
Go home and tell everyone
to come to see it

172
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,375
A film from Albania...

173
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,273
...totally changed my mother's fate

174
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,175
It was called 'Victory over Death'

175
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,352
The leading character was
a strong and beautiful woman guerrilla

176
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,050
Her name was Mila Galami

177
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,731
Mother's plan was to leave town
after seeing the movie

178
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,925
In those days,
the chance to see a foreign film...

179
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,561
...was too rare to pass up

180
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,212
Xuehua, what's the matter?

181
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,785
Your tummy is aching?

182
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,148
Come and sit here

183
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,395
Take me home

184
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,364
I've two more reels to show

185
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,296
Hang on a while

186
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,493
Take me home

187
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,797
Xu, she has a tummy-ache

188
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,063
Can you take her home?

189
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:17,601
How is she?

190
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,469
Let me take a look

191
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,400
Her tummy hurts

192
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,945
Let me see

193
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,707
I think she's about to give birth!

194
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,047
She's about to give birth!

195
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,917
Come on, everyone,
let's get her to the hospital

196
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,455
Slowly... carry her

197
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,926
I'd been in mother's womb
for only seven months...

198
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,260
...before I was born in the outdoor theater

199
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,731
It was as if my arrival set off a bomb...

200
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,598
...which destroyed my mother's whole life

201
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,569
Denounce the man
who made you pregnant!

202
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,332
Why don't you say?

203
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,136
Speak up!

204
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,471
We're all brothers and sisters

205
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,703
You can speak freely

206
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,382
Kneel down! Kneel down!

207
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,019
She's always been tainted by
petit-bourgeois thought!

208
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,714
One time she was cast
in 'The Red Lantern' as Li Tiemei

209
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,984
Didn't she see herself as Scarlett O'Hara?

210
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,884
Are you still dreaming of
becoming a movie star?

211
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,292
You'd better take a good look at yourself!

212
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,462
Or you're digging your own grave!

213
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,837
My mother was treated very badly

214
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,174
People swore at her wherever she went

215
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,551
She decided she'd rather die
than live without dignity

216
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,814
"Please be so kind as to adopt this baby"

217
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,684
"She's an orphan"

218
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,126
What are you doing here?

219
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,193
Don't let your baby cry!

220
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,129
I'm about to start the broadcast

221
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,768
Get out of here!

222
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,308
"Attention, please!"

223
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:03,414
"Attention, please...
tonight in the outdoor cinema..."

224
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,550
"...a repeat screening of
a film from Albania..."

225
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:09,449
"'Victory over Death'"

226
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,402
That very night,
the movie was shown again

227
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,040
My mother decided this would be...

228
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,769
...the last movie she ever saw

229
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,850
Once it was over,
she would depart this life

230
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,811
But she wanted to take one last look...

231
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,080
...at the lovely Mila Galami

232
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,268
What are you doing?

233
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:04,135
- I'm sorry
- Sit here!

234
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,736
She's carrying a baby!

235
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,435
What are you doing? Let her sit down!

236
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,639
You shameless slut!

237
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,213
Don't play the innocent!

238
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,214
Shameless!

239
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,249
Why are you hitting her?

240
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,420
She's eyeing my husband

241
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,712
You filthy slut!

242
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,846
Don't even know
who is the bastard's father!

243
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,922
You dare show the brat in public!

244
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,820
Where's your sense of shame?

245
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,422
Slut!

246
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,687
Aren't you ashamed?

247
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,164
How dare you hit me!

248
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,382
From that night on...

249
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,753
...Mother stopped thinking about
leaving me to face the world alone

250
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,990
She wanted to go on living...

251
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,253
...just like the brave movie heroine

252
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,964
Indomitable!

253
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,230
She wasn't allowed to go on
acting with the troupe

254
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,998
Or to go on announcing the news

255
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,733
Instead she brought home soiled sheets
from the hospital

256
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,871
She worked tirelessly to get them clean

257
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,675
As white as the screen in the cinema

258
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,064
That white screen was always there
as I grew up

259
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,171
At that time, my idol was Pan Dongzi
in 'Shining Red Star'

260
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,931
Whenever we walked on the street...

261
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,533
...everyone stared at us

262
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,235
Mother always told me
to keep my head high

263
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,141
"Even when a thousand pairs
of eyes are staring..."

264
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,607
"...you don't need to feel afraid"

265
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,051
Uncle Pan...

266
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,380
Ling Ling!

267
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,283
Tell your Ma to bring you to see
'Little Soldier Zhang Ga' tonight

268
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,124
Great!

269
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,416
What's playing tonight?

270
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,524
'Little Soldier Zhang Ga'

271
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,230
What movie is it?

272
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,299
'Little Soldier Zhang Ga'

273
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,504
Ling Ling

274
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,735
Look at those witches!

275
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:55,979
Nice perms they've had

276
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:57,806
Here, Ling Ling

277
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,040
After the film tonight...

278
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,480
...I'll take you somewhere
you can have fun

279
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,676
What kind of fun?

280
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:03,983
It's a secret

281
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,350
You'll see when we get there

282
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,211
I'm over here!

283
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,649
Sit down, you're in the beam!

284
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,187
Xuehua, where did you
get your hair curled?

285
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,415
It looks great

286
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,593
We're watching the movie, be quiet!

287
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,121
Okay, shut up

288
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,954
I'll never understand

289
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,199
Those people who persecuted
my mother before...

290
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,391
...are now sitting beside us...

291
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,134
...as if nothing ever happened

292
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,490
Reel change! Reel change!

293
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,630
The projectionist's fallen asleep!

294
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,198
The lazybones!

295
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,128
You pulled my ponytail

296
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,565
- No, I didn't - It was you

297
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,671
- No, I didn't - It was you

298
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,601
Boy, what's going on?

299
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,639
Did you pull her pony tail?

300
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,700
Be good and watch the movie

301
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,543
Stop teasing the little girl

302
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,976
Sit down!

303
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,649
I'll get my dad to fix you two

304
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,444
Sit down!

305
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,555
Mama, why don't I have a dad?

306
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,262
You do have a dad

307
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,795
Where is he?

308
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,173
Ling Ling, your dad is over there

309
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,148
Is he really my dad?

310
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,082
I took what my mother said
completely seriously

311
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,154
My dad is a movie hero, Luo Jinbao

312
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,294
Ling Ling, come here

313
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,451
That's Little Ga!

314
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,556
Uncle Pan, what's this?

315
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:28,529
Ling Ling, don't touch that

316
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,258
That's the reel of film, kid

317
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,901
Ma, it's Pan Dongzi!

318
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,298
Uncle, can I watch the movie from here?

319
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,370
Why not?

320
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,639
Do you want to watch a movie every day?

321
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,641
Yes

322
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,152
I don't want to be your daughter

323
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,251
I have a dad

324
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,252
My dad is Luo Jinbao

325
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,548
Right, Mama?

326
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,318
Yes

327
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,164
Alright, I'll show you something nice

328
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:11,337
See, Ling Ling, here's your dad!

329
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,838
Mama, can I go play with dad?

330
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,008
Ling Ling, your dad is no ordinary dad

331
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,914
He is a guerrilla

332
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,020
His work is very hard

333
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,215
So he can't be like other people's dads

334
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,859
He can't play with you

335
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,123
But he's a war hero

336
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,163
He's the greatest of all dads!

337
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,767
Mama, is Uncle Pan telling the truth?

338
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,197
Yes, he is

339
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:46,368
Ling Ling, do you want to see
your dad every day?

340
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,567
Yes!

341
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,356
I had a dream that night

342
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,503
In my dream,
I walked into the world of movies

343
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,646
Dad!

344
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,985
Dad!

345
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,491
Ling Ling

346
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,869
Uncle Pan!

347
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,872
Although I didn't find Dad in my dream...

348
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,371
...Uncle Pan was always around

349
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,910
We often went to his work room

350
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,579
And he showed us movies

351
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,922
Come on, let's watch a movie!

352
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,668
Mama, who are they?

353
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,336
They're movie stars

354
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,733
Why haven't I seen them before?

355
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,200
I've seen their movies

356
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,605
Her name is Zhou Xuan

357
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,211
She's Mama's favorite

358
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,810
You know this song?

359
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:15,816
I've often heard you hum it

360
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,384
That's how I know it

361
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,176
Those times with my Mama...

362
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,583
...were the happiest of my childhood

363
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,750
I secretly made up my mind...

364
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,219
...to become a superstar like
Zhou Xuan when I grew up

365
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,295
If Mama couldn't do it, I would!

366
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,808
When I was in first grade at school...

367
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,308
...I met a horrible boy

368
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,605
So thick he might have been born from a rock

369
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,613
His name was Mao Xiaobing
("Little Soldier" Mao)

370
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,043
Raise it... slowly...

371
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,847
Bullshit!

372
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,010
This is your so-called 'Big Movie World'?

373
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,916
This is your scheme to
make a lot of money?

374
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,214
Not at all

375
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,989
I just wanted to offer something fresh

376
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:00,950
What's fresh about it?

377
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,284
Just the same old stuff!

378
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,189
Come round with your wife after dinner

379
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,321
See a movie!

380
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,360
Uncle, are you the one
who shows the movie?

381
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,797
Yes... I don't think I've seen you before

382
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,368
I just moved here,
my name is Mao Xiaobing

383
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,233
Uncle, will you show a movie today?

384
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,304
Yes, 'Railway Guerrillas'

385
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,168
'Railway Guerrillas'!

386
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,171
Uncle, is this 'Railway Guerrillas'?

387
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,136
Yes

388
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,969
Can I turn this?

389
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,914
Yes, slowly

390
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,548
That's right, do it slowly

391
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,152
Okay, make sure it picks up

392
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,161
Careful, slowly...

393
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,795
I'll be back in a moment

394
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,671
Who are you?

395
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,505
What are you doing?

396
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,667
Put that down!

397
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,541
Stop!

398
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,353
Stop running!

399
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,064
Give that back!

400
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,325
No, I won't! Leave me alone!

401
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,900
Give me back that film!

402
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,302
Stop chasing me!

403
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,866
I'm exhausted!

404
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,381
I give up! Here...

405
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:24,330
You stinker! I hate you!

406
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,163
Hurry, Mama

407
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,330
The movie's going to start

408
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,035
M r. Pan, sorry to be slow

409
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,543
We're delaying you

410
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,776
Don't mention it!

411
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,855
What are you looking at?

412
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,486
Try that again and I'll break the binoculars

413
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,856
You've repeated two classes already

414
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,429
If it happens again at this new school...

415
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,226
...I'll have to beat you to death

416
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,298
I've been talking to you all day

417
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,399
Are you listening?

418
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,263
Get up! Let's move!

419
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,040
This is our new classmate

420
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,646
Let's give him a big welcome

421
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,717
Tell your classmates your name

422
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,412
My name's Mao Xiaobing

423
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,416
I'm Chairman Mao's Little Soldier!

424
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,953
Quiet please, everyone

425
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,795
In his last school
he had to repeat two classes

426
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,527
Today he transfers to our school...

427
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,866
...and joins our class

428
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,131
Please give him all the help he needs

429
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,473
What's wrong?

430
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,744
Yesterday someone stole something
from Uncle Pan

431
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,879
It was him!

432
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,070
Did you steal something yesterday?

433
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,873
- I didn't - It was you!

434
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,142
It wasn't me

435
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,353
I saw you do it!

436
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,817
I swear to Teacher Huang that
I didn't steal anything

437
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,294
It's very bad to steal

438
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,587
And it's even worse to lie

439
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,822
We'll look into this later

440
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,001
Now, who'll sit next to Mao Xiaobing?

441
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,169
"25: Delivering a Raincoat"

442
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,534
"It's late at night..."

443
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:48,007
"But Premier Zhou is still hard at work..."

444
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,944
Teacher gave him the seat next to mine

445
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,974
He teaches us to "Learn from Lei Feng"...

446
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,779
...by treating our comrades
like the warmth of spring

447
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,584
But Mao Xiaobing was always
troublesome to me

448
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,781
He drove me crazy

449
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:13,696
What are you doing?

450
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,066
Hands off!

451
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,138
Mao Xiaobing! What are you doing?

452
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,104
Where are you going?

453
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,981
To stand outside as a punishment

454
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,206
Go!

455
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,848
Beat him up!

456
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,855
Beat him to death!

457
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,819
Don't move! Don't move!

458
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,318
Where are you going?

459
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,989
Which unit are you from?

460
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,558
Don't beat me!

461
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:49,029
Move! No tricks!

462
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,229
Commander, we caught a spy!

463
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,596
I'm not a spy!

464
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,635
What are you doing here?

465
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,168
I want to play with you

466
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,705
Let me play too, okay?

467
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,806
You want to play with us?

468
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,977
Who will you be?

469
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,611
I'd like to be a good guy

470
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,344
But you look more like a traitor

471
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,416
Stand up! Stand up!

472
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,983
In the name of the Party and the People...

473
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,321
...I sentence you to the firing squad!

474
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,799
Mao Xiaobing!

475
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,368
Mao Xiaobing, come here

476
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,364
What are you doing?

477
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,803
Come here

478
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,802
If you want to play with us...

479
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,137
...bring us that flower girl!

480
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,847
Give me back my film-strip

481
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,210
- I lost it - You're lying

482
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,442
I really lost it

483
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,880
Then get me another one

484
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,920
- Really? - Yes

485
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,022
Come on, then!

486
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,060
Commander, the Eighth Route Army
has gone

487
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,602
We've captured a flower girl

488
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,067
Good, tie her up

489
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,275
You can't move! Go!

490
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,479
Let me go! Let me go!

491
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,011
Where is the Eighth Route Army?

492
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,281
Untie me!

493
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,352
Mao Xiaobing, untie me right now!

494
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,722
Jiang Ling Ling, you'd better answer

495
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,017
Or they'll beat you for sure

496
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:22,926
Mao Xiaobing

497
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,623
- Punish her! - Yes, sir

498
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,826
Mao Xiaobing,
I'll tell your father about this!

499
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,799
He'll beat the hell out of you!

500
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,537
I won't hurt you any more
but don't tell my dad!

501
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,679
How dare you kick me!

502
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:44,780
You stay here all day!

503
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,382
Die of thirst! Let's go!

504
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,212
Untie me!

505
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,919
Let me go!

506
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,084
Ling Ling, I've come to rescue you

507
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,763
Promise you won't tell my dad

508
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,024
He'll truly beat the hell out of me

509
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,158
Ling Ling, did you hear me?

510
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,737
You go home! Don't worry...

511
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,006
I'll deal with him later!

512
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,010
You little wretch!

513
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:22,747
Always causing trouble!

514
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,080
I'll teach you!

515
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,416
Come here!

516
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,459
More trouble every day!

517
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,228
I'll teach you, you little bastard!

518
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,757
Stop, damn you!

519
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,589
Don't play tricks with me!

520
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,896
Uncle, don't beat him!

521
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,205
Uncle, open the door!

522
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,905
Why are you still here?

523
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,374
Uncle, please stop beating him

524
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,842
I have to teach him a lesson

525
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,376
How dare you run away?

526
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,506
Come back!

527
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,016
Stay away if you dare!

528
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,952
I'll kill you if you come back!

529
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,828
Mao Xiaobing...

530
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,063
Mao Xiaobing...

531
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,664
Mao Xiaobing, come down

532
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,736
Quick, come down

533
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,340
Why are you following me?

534
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,942
You're bleeding

535
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,236
None of your business

536
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,403
Go away! I'm watching a movie

537
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,883
You're lying, there's no movie
in the daytime

538
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,485
If you don't believe me, forget it

539
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:47,725
Mao Xiaobing, you must be crazy

540
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,990
There isn't any movie

541
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,224
Don't believe me? Look!

542
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,901
There's nothing there

543
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,402
Concentrate!

544
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,972
'Railway Guerrillas' is on?

545
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,248
Mao Xiaobing told me
his binoculars worked like magic

546
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:43,945
They showed him whatever he wanted

547
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,198
Your dad beats you so hard

548
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,697
Why doesn't your Ma stop him?

549
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,025
She's not my mother

550
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,499
My real mother divorced my dad

551
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:00,931
She married someone else

552
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,003
She wants her new son, not me

553
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,503
Does it hurt?

554
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,270
Yes, every time he beats me...

555
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,379
...I think of war movies I've seen

556
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,012
I imagine him as a Japanese soldier...

557
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,980
...and myself as a Communist fighter

558
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,209
Then I'm not afraid any more!

559
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:21,687
That's not how it seemed,
you screamed like this!

560
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,121
Not like that, watch me!

561
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,058
"You little bastard!"

562
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,787
"I will beat you to death!"

563
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,124
"Take that!"

564
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,628
Don't hit me!

565
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,565
"You wretch!"

566
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,901
"You can't hide from me!"

567
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,169
"I will beat you to death!"

568
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,682
Auntie, can I stay here
for a couple of days?

569
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,290
My dad says he'll kill me if I go home

570
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,053
Mama, will you let him stay?

571
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,759
Alright, you can stay

572
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:19,549
So Mao Xiaobing came to stay

573
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:25,286
We played together,
watched movies together

574
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,650
I wish those days could last forever

575
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,358
Why did we have to grow up?

576
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,026
"The night was dark"

577
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,061
"The train raced down the track"

578
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:13,226
"The guerrillas managed to leap on board"

579
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,438
"Not a single ballet was wasted"

580
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,300
That's not right

581
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,137
"Not a single bullet"

582
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,366
I know

583
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,939
"One shot took out the foreign devil
on the footplate"

584
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,647
In Uncle Pan's work room...

585
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,943
...we found lots of movie storypicture books

586
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,679
So on days when no movie was shown...

587
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,549
...we looked at them together

588
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,247
We could imagine the movie

589
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:40,291
"He fired three shots in the air..."

590
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:58,537
Mao Xiaobing...

591
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,369
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

592
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,478
I want to join the army...

593
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,011
...to fight against the Japanese

594
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,650
I want to be a movie star

595
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,912
Then I'll able to see you on screen!

596
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,932
Move!

597
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,759
What?

598
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,434
- You can't sit here! - Why not?

599
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,469
This is my territory!

600
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:30,538
We were here first

601
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:31,741
But you can't sit here

602
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,466
- Let's go! - No!

603
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,139
I'm going even if you won't

604
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,481
Mao Xiaobing, come back!

605
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,149
Don't be scared!

606
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,410
Ling Ling, come over here

607
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,917
We can watch from somewhere else

608
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,922
You coward, I'm staying here!

609
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,621
Fetch my chair

610
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,625
No, I won't

611
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,093
Go and fetch my chair

612
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,828
Get up, let's go!

613
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,095
Where are you going?

614
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,169
Mao Xiaobing plays with girls!

615
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,873
Shameful!

616
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,313
Just ignore them!

617
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,748
We can see better up here anyway

618
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,316
Let me help you

619
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,890
I don't want your help

620
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:26,218
What's wrong?

621
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,328
Ignoring me?

622
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,967
It's really clear!

623
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,999
- Take a look - No

624
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,378
Don't be angry, take a look

625
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,732
"Brother"

626
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,133
Brother

627
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,039
You're crying!

628
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,437
You rascal!

629
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,875
- Do you have a brother? - No

630
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,672
Then I'll be your brother

631
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,142
You look like a traitor

632
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,009
That won't do for my brother

633
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,122
My brother should be as handsome as him

634
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,087
- Then give me back my binoculars
- Give it to me

635
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,424
Careful! Don't slip and fall!

636
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:35,660
The roof top became our secret base

637
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,325
Xiaobing held me tight whenever
we climbed up...

638
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,333
...to watch movies from up there

639
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:55,551
"We row a boat across the lake"

640
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,722
"The lovely white temple
is reflected by the water"

641
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:04,758
"Trees and beautiful landscapes
everywhere we look"

642
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,862
You were out of tune

643
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,323
No I wasn't, you were

644
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,430
Alright, it was sung very well

645
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,463
Nobody was out of tune

646
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,932
Auntie, are we going to see a movie?

647
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:14,704
Yes

648
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,068
Mama, which movie is it?

649
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,903
We'll find out when we get there

650
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,310
Don't push!

651
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,315
This is the last ticket!

652
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,146
Someone will get hurt!

653
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:33,382
Sold out!

654
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,684
No more tickets?

655
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,329
- No more - Not a single one

656
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,567
Ling Ling, Xiaobing,
there're no more tickets

657
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,532
But I want to see 'Street Angel'

658
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,237
Follow me

659
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,576
I couldn't get tickets, can I pay you?

660
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,504
Can you let us in please?

661
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,111
No entry without ticket

662
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,441
Hey, he doesn't have a ticket!

663
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:05,715
Get out! You kids, get out!

664
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,897
Auntie, this is the men's toilet

665
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,571
Hu rry, you coward!

666
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,717
Mama, hurry!

667
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:44,994
You two go in

668
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,151
I've seen this film before

669
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,886
I'll wait for you out here

670
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,624
Where's your ticket?

671
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,565
And yours?

672
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,301
You little devils! When did you sneak in?

673
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,531
Why are you manhandling the kids?

674
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,872
Hey, don't cry!

675
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,340
So what if we don't see it!

676
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:10,207
It was no good anyway

677
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,778
I thought it was a war movie

678
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,607
What do you know?

679
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:13,715
You're just a bumpkin

680
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,112
I'm not!

681
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,810
Let's go back and see Uncle Pan's movie

682
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,658
This is Zhou Xuan

683
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,292
She starred in 'Street Angel'

684
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:25,552
Is she good-looking?

685
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:28,524
You don't think she is?

686
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,424
Not as beautiful as your Ma

687
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,693
You're such a toady!

688
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:32,935
I mean it!

689
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,333
You're afraid she'll throw you out

690
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,402
- No - Yes

691
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,630
- No - Yes

692
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,901
Okay, okay...

693
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,007
What does 'Street Angel' mean?

694
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,346
An angel lives in heaven

695
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,785
Very kind, very beautiful

696
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,885
She comes down to earth

697
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,450
She's now very poor

698
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,230
But still very kind and beautiful

699
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,558
Who is it?

700
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,828
Who's there?

701
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,129
I'll see

702
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,236
You little wretch!

703
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:18,980
Where are you going? Let's go!

704
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,715
What are you doing?

705
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,285
I'm taking my son home

706
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,888
I won't go... Ma

707
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,418
You call her "Ma"?

708
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,287
You disloyal wretch!

709
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,257
Your mother has dumplings on the table

710
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,553
We're waiting for you

711
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,458
He can go home but you mustn't beat him

712
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,767
He's my son! I'm his dad!

713
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,528
It's none of your business

714
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,536
This is my house, not yours

715
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,470
I can do whatever I like

716
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,108
Who do you think you are?

717
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,715
Dad, I'll come home with you

718
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,382
Then get a move on

719
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:04,020
Mao Xiaobing... Mao Xiaobing...

720
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,300
After Xiaobing was taken home...

721
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,061
...there was a big change in my family

722
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,105
It scared me

723
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,804
I saw Mama with Uncle Pan

724
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,338
They're in love with each other

725
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,170
You can't let them fall in love

726
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,744
My Ma abandoned me
when she married again

727
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,907
And now, my dad doesn't want me either

728
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,349
He's sending me away tomorrow morning

729
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,486
Where to?

730
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,016
To live with my g rand-dad

731
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,589
Where does he live?

732
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,623
It takes three days on the train

733
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,058
So I'll never see you again

734
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:17,488
You can have these

735
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,895
Anyhow, I'll never be able to see movies
through them again

736
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,637
Mao Xiaobing!

737
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,616
Ma, Ma!

738
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,251
What is it, Ling Ling?

739
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,352
Xiaobing's father is sending him away

740
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,457
Go and talk to him

741
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,126
He can stay with us, can't he?

742
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,192
Who are you looking for?

743
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,198
Xiaobing's father

744
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,133
He's out

745
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,295
And Xiaobing?

746
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,606
He's already gone to the station

747
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,440
Ma, hu rry!

748
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,034
Ma, where's the train?

749
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,002
Comrade, what time is the train to Anhui?

750
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,005
It left an hour ago

751
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,337
Uncle, can you make it come back?

752
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,207
Little friend, if I could do that...

753
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,914
...the sun would come up in the west!

754
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,988
Mao Xiaobing, you're a bad boy!

755
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:54,586
Come back! You bad boy, come back!

756
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,679
Mao Xiaobing was gone

757
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,657
And all the joys of my childhood
went with him

758
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,419
Whenever I looked through the binoculars...

759
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,129
...I imagine I can see where he is

760
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,431
What's he doing?

761
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,068
Does he remember me?

762
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,913
Hey, man!

763
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:48,982
Officers

764
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,183
Your boss is looking for you

765
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:51,251
Wants you to pay for the bike

766
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,821
How's the g ir I who h it me?

767
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,548
You're out of luck there

768
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:56,714
She probably won't be charged

769
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,257
I don't want to sue her, I...

770
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,360
Let me finish

771
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,551
We have the doctor's report

772
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,698
She is mentally unbalanced

773
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:03,560
She's ill?

774
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,659
And her hearing is impaired

775
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,163
Oh, she...

776
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,600
She's effectively deaf

777
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,304
What happened to her?

778
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,575
Can I see her now?

779
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:17,210
She's in a psychiatric clinic

780
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,707
Where is it?

781
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,310
It has regulations

782
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:22,576
Patients undergoing treatment...

783
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,252
...are not allowed visitors

784
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,853
I'd just like to see her

785
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,380
You'd be wasting your time

786
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,989
She doesn't recognize anyone

787
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,922
Let's leave it for a day or two

788
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,219
If anything changes, I'll tell you

789
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,693
Officer, I...

790
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,262
She can't recognize anyone?

791
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,215
I never imagined that this was how...

792
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,781
...I'd find Ling Ling again

793
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,078
I didn't recognize her

794
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,283
She's not the Ling Ling I used to know

795
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,152
She was so lively back then

796
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,723
What happened to her after I left?

797
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,524
After Mao Xiaobing left...

798
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,794
...Mama and Uncle Pan got married

799
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:45,795
First bow! Second bow! Third bow!

800
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:51,907
Today Pan Daren and Jiang Xuehua
are celebrating their marriage

801
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,302
Look, everyone, isn't the bride lovely?

802
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:57,776
Today Xuehua is more beautiful
than any movie star

803
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,672
Thank you all!

804
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,546
Please eat well, drink well
and enjoy yourselves!

805
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,219
I'll be showing movies all evening

806
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,688
Kids, go out to the backyard

807
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,693
- This little box shows movies?
- Yes

808
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,024
Show us!

809
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,666
Daren, why not forget the movies
this evening

810
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:19,495
Just show us this new toy

811
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,192
- A novelty for everyone - Okay

812
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,338
Daren, you're the richest man in this town

813
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,237
And Xuehua is the prettiest woman

814
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,341
Yes, of course

815
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,775
Daren has not only married
a beautiful wife...

816
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,345
...he's also gained a beautiful daughter!

817
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,981
Two for the price of one!

818
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,043
No flies on him!

819
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,716
I'll go fetch Ling Ling

820
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,085
What a loudmouth!

821
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,954
Excuse us, please, excuse us

822
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,459
Let Ling Ling greet her new dad

823
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:55,068
Ling Ling, greet your dad

824
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:57,665
If you don't, your Mama won't
want you any more!

825
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,632
Greet him, Ling Ling

826
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,577
He is not my dad

827
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,476
My dad is Luo Jinbao

828
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,554
Never mind

829
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,055
Don't make it hard for her

830
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,391
Xuehua and I have prepared a song

831
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:25,433
Ling Ling, you heard this
when you were born

832
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,906
I hate the television

833
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,909
I hate its sound

834
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,482
I hate watching it

835
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:18,214
Now that it's here,
people have gone off movies

836
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,887
And one year later...

837
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,992
...there's another disgusting
arrival in our house

838
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,488
My little brother was born

839
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,624
Mama named him Bing Bing

840
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,767
Dad, Ma, quick! Come here!

841
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,825
Do you think our son
looks like Pan Dongzi?

842
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,553
He does

843
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,997
If he ever gets the chance
to act in a movie...

844
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:06,897
...he'll be much better than Pan Dongzi!

845
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,603
Come on, sing it for Mama once more

846
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,795
My superstar, let Mama kiss you!

847
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,732
My superstar! My baby!

848
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:47,205
Sister, how was my singing?

849
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,574
The Youth Training School
is recruiting students

850
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,476
I want to let Bing Bing have a go

851
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,480
Maybe he could become a movie actor!

852
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:56,783
Great!

853
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,514
Can I play with your binoculars?

854
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,053
No, they're mine

855
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:05,156
Bing Bing, would you like to be an actor?

856
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,125
You might be in a movie!

857
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,027
Yes!

858
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,891
Let Mama bring you to try out
for the school

859
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,154
- Do you dare to try? - Yes!

860
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:11,458
That's great, son

861
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,396
I want to try for the school too

862
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,027
You're going to go to middle school

863
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:16,034
Concentrate on your studies

864
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,206
Let's discuss it later

865
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,737
I must go!

866
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,706
Mama, why don't sister and I both try?

867
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:27,876
- Alright - That's wonderful!

868
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,866
I'd never seen the Training School
before that day

869
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,663
And I felt happier than I'd been for ages

870
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:25,273
It was as if they'd already let me join

871
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,728
Ling Ling!

872
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,595
Ling Ling, quick!

873
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,241
Mama

874
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,621
What're you doing here, Ma?

875
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:18,886
What's wrong? What's this?

876
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,427
Oh my god, an acceptance letter!

877
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:27,534
A place in Training School!

878
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:28,670
Oh, Mama!

879
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:30,497
They're offering your brother a place too

880
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,099
But the tuition fees are very h igh

881
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,268
You're about to enter middle school

882
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,571
So let your brother go first

883
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,304
You can join him later, okay?

884
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,415
No, I want to go!

885
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,518
I can go to middle school as well!

886
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,050
I'll be frank with you

887
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,713
We can't really afford...

888
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,683
...to pay tuition fees for both of you

889
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:51,791
Let your brother go first

890
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:52,950
Understand?

891
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,690
I have to go!

892
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,524
Ling Ling, you're the eldest

893
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,063
Don't be so selfish!

894
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:11,806
Look, sister, Dad bought me some fishes

895
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,876
I got a place in the School, didn't you?

896
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,085
Sister, don't be so unhappy

897
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,226
You can try again next time

898
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,721
Sister, shall we feed the fishes?

899
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,993
Don't bother me, leave me alone!

900
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,908
Bing Bing, shall we go out?

901
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:51,747
Yes, where are we going?

902
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,889
Sister, it's beautiful!

903
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,396
- You like it here? - Yes

904
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,056
Shall we get out?

905
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:05,198
Yes

906
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:23,884
Sister! Be quick!

907
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,442
Sister! Sister!

908
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:03,583
Bing Bing! Bing Bing!

909
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,155
Where's your little brother?

910
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:15,631
Where did you take him?

911
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,108
You were seen taking him on a bus

912
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,173
Where did you take him?

913
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,708
I'm asking you!

914
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,813
Where did you take your brother?

915
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,550
Sister!

916
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,345
You scared Mama to death!

917
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,009
Mama, I'm alright

918
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:10,050
Tell Mama how did you get lost?

919
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,524
I went out to play alone and I got lost

920
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:18,059
Really? Really?

921
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:05,004
Bing Bing hid the truth from Mama

922
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,883
I felt so ashamed at what I'd done

923
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,949
Seeing his innocent face...

924
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:13,314
...for the first time since his birth...

925
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,821
...I wanted to be close to him

926
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,291
They say the outdoor cinema
is being demolished

927
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,394
Is it true?

928
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:22,895
Are they going to build a factory?

929
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,994
Yes, it's coming down tomorrow

930
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,472
Tonight's will be
the last show 'The Back Alley'

931
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,437
You should all come if you can

932
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,409
Dad, are you showing a movie tonight?

933
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,082
Yes, do you want to come?

934
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:41,850
Yes

935
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,080
Fine, ask Mama to bring you after dinner

936
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,191
The 'Big Movie World'
will be demolished tomorrow

937
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:01,191
Now there're TV sets and
tape recorders in every home

938
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,429
Nobody wants to see outdoor movies
any more

939
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:06,699
Alright, you finish eating

940
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,139
I'll go to prepare the show

941
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,136
Thank you

942
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:39,705
Come and get changed

943
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:45,873
Ling Ling, what are you doing?

944
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,571
I want to come too

945
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,607
Your exam is coming up

946
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,714
Stay here and study

947
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,252
Mama, can't sister come too?

948
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:55,646
Quiet!

949
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,152
But it's the last show tonight!

950
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,289
You're entering the home straight

951
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:04,164
You can't afford to relax now

952
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,094
I want to go!

953
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:13,498
Ling Ling, I have no more hopes for myself

954
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,701
All my hopes are invested in you two

955
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,306
There's more to life than watching movies

956
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,481
Understand?

957
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:21,681
But I must go!

958
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,076
You have to listen to me

959
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,248
But I really want to go!

960
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,804
"Who taught you that?"

961
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:53,072
"My mother taught me when I was little"

962
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,285
"I was in kindergarten"

963
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:00,817
"Those childhood years were so good"

964
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,351
"Why do we have to grow up?"

965
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,723
"We grow up because we eat"

966
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,564
Mama locked me up at home

967
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:19,205
But my heart flew to the outdoor cinema

968
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,300
And I thought about Mao Xiaobing

969
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,503
Remembering the times...

970
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,875
...we watched movies from our perch

971
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,085
Who is it?

972
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:40,462
Open the door

973
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,059
Officers

974
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,027
What are you doing here?

975
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,499
Oh, I'm...

976
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,638
I'm feeding her fishes

977
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,238
Feeding her fishes?

978
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,965
I thought you didn't know her?

979
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,208
It's true, I don't...

980
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:58,243
Well, actually...

981
01:16:58,414 --> 01:16:59,642
Did you lie to us?

982
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:00,473
No!

983
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,445
Actually I did know her
when she was young

984
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,276
But I only realized that yesterday

985
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,011
Make up your own story... go ahead!

986
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:08,520
Hey boy, don't hurry

987
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,591
Take your time

988
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,728
We just want to find out
if she has any relatives

989
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,987
She seems to live alone

990
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,959
We heard from the clinic today

991
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,193
Apparently she's recovering

992
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,132
Improving quite fast

993
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,202
Really?

994
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,238
She's explained what happened that day

995
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,903
Do you know why she did it?

996
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,180
Why?

997
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:33,572
I'll tell you

998
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,279
Your bike ran into a stack of bricks

999
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,351
And her dog was right behind them

1000
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,180
The bricks fell and crushed her dog

1001
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,153
The incident triggered
something in her head...

1002
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,019
...and she hit you with a brick

1003
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,252
I didn't see any dog

1004
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,262
Liu, over here

1005
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,332
There's a balcony out here

1006
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,574
These look like mine

1007
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,778
Yours?

1008
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,144
Looks like it

1009
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,149
What exactly is your relationship with her?

1010
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,620
Has she said that she knows me?

1011
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,319
No

1012
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,195
What's this all about?

1013
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,495
How are you involved?

1014
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:27,896
I'm asking you

1015
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,241
Now I get it!

1016
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,817
Hey, where are you going?

1017
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,482
Who do you want?

1018
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,555
Why have you come?

1019
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:33,191
I want to find out something about Ling Ling

1020
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,598
What about her?

1021
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:39,700
How did she lose her hearing?

1022
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,829
Uncle Pan told me that he was showing...

1023
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,529
...the last outdoor movie that night

1024
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,006
Mama, I want to go to the toilet

1025
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:24,546
I'll take you home

1026
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,118
No, Mama, I can go alone

1027
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:27,788
You stay here

1028
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,285
- Are you sure? - Yes

1029
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:34,588
Alright, take care and hu rry back

1030
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,913
Sister, sister...

1031
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:56,849
What are you doing back here?

1032
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,019
Sister, let's watch the movie together

1033
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,414
How did you get the key?

1034
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,954
I told Ma I needed to use the toilet

1035
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:06,389
So she gave me the key

1036
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,157
I'll take you to a nice place

1037
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,603
This is g reat!

1038
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:25,941
We can come here every day
to watch the movies!

1039
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:30,251
No, the cinema will be torn down tomorrow

1040
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:54,200
Look through these

1041
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,651
Hey, let me see

1042
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,000
Sister, my turn

1043
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:29,176
Don't snatch! I haven't finished!

1044
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:36,645
Okay, all yours... I'm going

1045
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,915
Sister, don't go! I'm...

1046
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:41,677
I don't know why I was so heavy-handed

1047
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,618
My blow left her deaf

1048
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:48,381
And then she disappeared

1049
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,887
Didrt you look for her?

1050
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:56,189
We did all we could,
but we never found her

1051
01:23:57,566 --> 01:24:01,058
But recently someone's been
sending us money...

1052
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,605
Husband, I'm back

1053
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,507
This is...?

1054
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,346
Auntie, it's me!

1055
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:46,904
Where is Ling Ling now?

1056
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,037
She's in a psychiatric clinic

1057
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,176
A clinic?

1058
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:52,276
A couple of days ago...

1059
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:55,679
...my bike ran into a stack of bricks

1060
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,183
The stack toppled and sadly killed her dog

1061
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:01,844
She suffered a big shock

1062
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:06,351
our dog went missing the other day...

1063
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:09,095
And it was found dead in a back-alley

1064
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:24,068
In all these years,
I've learned to live alone

1065
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:25,704
No conversation

1066
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,209
No sound

1067
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,313
No communication at all

1068
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,415
One night I was taking out the garbage...

1069
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:36,288
...and I found a puppy in the bin

1070
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,456
Someone had dumped him

1071
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,990
I brought him home

1072
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,821
Gave him a bath

1073
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,632
And since he looked so smart...

1074
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,802
...I suddenly decided to call him Bing Bing

1075
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:55,174
Bing Bing stayed with me

1076
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:57,471
We lived together

1077
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,474
He's the only one who can read
my thoughts...

1078
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:02,275
...and understand how I feel

1079
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,417
But when I look through the binoculars
at my parents...

1080
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:09,716
...I see only two lonely faces

1081
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:14,762
I think maybe they need Bing Bing
more than I do

1082
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,958
Who is it?

1083
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:12,518
So at last I understand
what I did to Ling Ling

1084
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:17,416
Although at the time
it happened I had no idea

1085
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:14,605
The clinic contacted us...

1086
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:17,114
...and said that we could visit Ling Ling

1087
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,248
We were so excited

1088
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,985
Her parents talked to the clinic

1089
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:23,890
They agreed to a treat for Ling Ling

1090
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,458
Her favorite... an outdoor movie show

1091
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,934
Sister, look at the goldfish!

1092
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:44,303
Look, sister, I have fishes too

1093
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:53,620
That boy over there gave them to me

1094
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,097
Sit down

1095
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,817
You're welcome

1096
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,419
Those two fishes almost died yesterday

1097
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:34,357
I thought I'd overfed them

1098
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,793
Then I realized
I needed to change the water

1099
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,632
You see, I've already killed
your dog by accident

1100
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:41,300
If I kill your fishes too...

1101
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:44,199
...I wouldn't be able to face you

1102
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:47,170
Sorry...

1103
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,905
I forgot, you can't hear me

1104
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:55,844
This is for you

1105
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:03,281
You recognize me, right?

1106
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,958
I was Mao Xiaobing!

1107
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,793
Now I'm Mao Dabing

1108
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,700
It's okay...

1109
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,374
Brother...

1110
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,170
What is it?

1111
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,143
Brother, there's a movie show over there

1112
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,437
Oh, a movie...

1113
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,011
Ling Ling, let's watch it

1114
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:27,646
Come on...

1115
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:08,581
The time of day I like best is
just after sunset

1116
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:12,452
That's when they put up a screen

1117
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:16,586
Everyone brings their own stool

1118
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:19,124
And as darkness falls...

1119
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,167
...the movie begins

1120
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:28,233
The movie begins

1121
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,108
It takes me back to the great times
I used to have...

1122
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:34,372
...with Mao Xiaobing and my parents

1123
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:37,649
That was a golden age for movies

1124
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:41,722
The people on screen,
their images and voices...

1125
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,448
...brought us all together

1126
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,327
Breathing as one... Dreaming as one

1127
01:32:50,305 --> 01:32:56,677
